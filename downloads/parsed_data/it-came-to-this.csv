"event","Tonight, I realized something about myself. I'm not really sure how it happened, but I no longer have the patience for many immature things. It was a normal night, hanging out after lab. We decided to watch a movie. It was one that I had been telling myself not to watch, Borat. I decided to stay and watch the movie. After all, I did want to hang out with my friends. I realized that I was not laughing nearly as much as the people around me, nor did I enjoy the actual movie.

This is not the only incident that I have taken note of. One of my friends here in Orlando loves to talk ""baby talk"". It's as if she is talking to an infant. I can't stand when she talks to me this way. I am not a child. It is really hard to have a conversation with someone who is three years older than you when they are speaking so childish. 

This list of immature things is endless. It just really caught my attention lately. I have gone through a lot more than most of the people around me. I have experienced so much more, yet I am so much younger. What happened to my childhood? Why was it taken from me so early in life? Is it better that I realize what I want to do with the rest of my life at 19? Most of my friends here are 3-4 years older than me, and still confused. In fact, many are going to live with their parents after they graduate. I just don't understand. Isn't that moving backwards? 


*Notice* In no way am I saying that I am not immature at times. I plan on going skydiving in about a month, I own stuffed animals, and I still complain about the small things."

"event","A while ago I posted a very confused entry. It was about an extremely hard test here at Full Sail. Casey had passed, and I felt obligated to pass this certification. I am pleased to announce that I have passed this first stage of Pro Tools certification tests. 

Also, it is not as hard as everyone said it would be. I'm not sure if that is because they wanted to over prepare us, or because I studied really hard for a long time. I spent countless hours with my nose in books. For anyone who knows me, you know how hard that is for me. I'm not one to just sit still and read. I like to be doing things, not reading about them. I separated my reading with lecture, lab, and many open labs. I was beyond determined to pass this test. 

I'm still unsure of why I felt as though I had to pass because Casey had. Though my testing did start this way, it did not continue like that. You have 3 opportunities to take this test. I, as well as Casey, failed the first attempt. Unlike Casey, I had two days before my second try. After failing the first one, and knowing what is expected of me, I was determined to pass, but this time, it was because I was so close, and I just wanted to have it for myself. The second time had nothing to do with anyone but me. No longer did I care if I would be accepted, nor did I care what anyone else's opinion was. I just wanted to pass to have a better resume and to show myself that I can do anything with the proper training.

Also, since that post, my GPA has skyrocketed and there are 3 A's on my transcript. I have learned to balance my sleep and studying schedule a little more in the past two months. As for caring as much now, as I did then. I was a little off. I care more now than I did two months ago. Then it was only a vision, now it is reality."

"event","Wow, I don't remember the last time I was so nervous about a lab practical and then relieved to get a 100. At 11:00 PM I had to take an exit exam on the SSL 9000J console. I was waiting for other students to finish so I could start the torture. I was so nervous about messing one thing up it made me sick to my stomach. When my turn came around, I knew there was nothing else to do, but give it my all. Well, I did. I got stuck twice. I made a wrong patch and quickly realized there was no signal. I rushed to the Patchbay and corrected myself. It was a simple fix, and I knew what I had done wrong. The second one was a little more complicated. I was just about done, when Mark (The instructor) directed me to do something I had no idea how to do. I'm sure they taught me, I just must have forgotten the last few labs. I stayed calm and just tried to put some logic into what he was telling me to do. After about 15 seconds of deep thought I turned the only knobs that made sense to me. He nodded to acknowledge that I was correct. 

Of course this grade is not for certain. The Instructors are not allowed to distribute the grades during the lab. On the other hand, normal people do not respond to an action with ""Great"" if you do something wrong. Every time I completed a task, Mark's response was ""Great"", or ""Good job"". I hope I was correct in my assumptions."

"event","On my drive home, I was thinking about high school. Two of the 3 years I had a boyfriend and the perfect group of friends. Not a worry in the world. My Junior/Senior year I lost the boyfriend but still had strong ties with him and I was even closer with a few of my friends. I moved to Florida for college and I don't really have any close friends here. There are no girls (1 to be precise), and none of the guys realize that I'm into video games too, as well as music, movies, sports even, the same stuff they are. This being the case, I get left out of a lot of events. When I first moved here, I thought it was because I'm young (many people here are a few years older than I), but no, I'm a girl. Forget this girly scene. No wonder I used to dress and act how I did. Baggy clothes, hanging out with mostly guys. Maybe I should go back to that... I'd be mistaken for a guy and get to do something for a change. Sitting at home gets old really fast.

Why can't things be like they used to? My two best friends and I hanging out all the time, not even having to do anything... We had the best times. The thing is... I don't even really talk to one of them anymore. The other is in the Navy so I can talk to him, I just can't see him if I go home for Christmas. I was talking to my mom about coming home for Christmas... but then started rambling about how no one but Micah would be there. Alison would, and Casey would. I see Casey all the time though, and he would be off with other friends of his(I know for a fact) and like I said, Alison and I don't really talk. Micah would even be preoccupied with his mom because he doesn't see her all the time. 

I don't know... I just need a Brandi closer to where I am.  Its hard not having a close friend close to you. I guess this is what I get for going to a school with nine guys for every one girl. That is okay, I'm out in less than six months anyway."

"event","I would just like to tell everyone how much I appreciate my close friends. Not to say that I don't appreciate my more distant friends, because I do. However, I care more for my closer friends. The friends that I will always be in contact with (even if it is not on a regular basis), the friends that you can lose contact with for years and when you find them, have conversations as if you hadn't. People who know you so well, there is no difference between a personal question or normal one, and people who share memories from so long ago, you are the only ones that can remember. While I don't have many of these friends, it is nice to give them the credit they deserve. In short, thanks for everything you have done and will continue to do for me.

On a totally different level, I just returned from one of the best labs I have ever had in my college career. This is not in anyway to say that it was easy. If I were given that lab practical, there is a good chance that I would get a low score. The reason it was so great is because of how I felt going in and coming out. When there is a soundboard bigger than you are, you tend to feel unsteady. I walked in thinking this was going to be a nightmare. I changed my mind drastically. I've never seen myself learn, or even want to learn, that fast in my entire life. It was one of the most amazing things. I believe that this month is going to be tough, and I will have to study constantly, but for the first time in four months I have come home from my 9p-1a lab and been too excited to go to bed. If this is what school can do to me, bring on the internships and the career. I'm so psyched that I don't even care about how bad my lab schedule is. I don't know many people who like school. I know fewer that love it. Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to say that I am one who loves school."

"event","It is around 12:15 am, and my cell rings. Half asleep, I answer only a little aware of who it is. Casey is on the other end rambling about something. When I realize that he has asked me a question, I search my memory for the correct answer. After that was all sorted out, I get the reason for his late night chat. He had just taken a very important test here at school. The optional Pro Tools certification test is a damn near impossible test to pass. Three people from the class prior to Casey's had passed. This month, I'm not sure how many had passed, but I do know that Casey is now certified. Obviously, I'm very proud of him and excited for him. 

When the call ends I could not go right back to sleep. (I have been suffering from severe insomnia these past two weeks. When I finally get to sleep, I will suddenly be wide awake a few hours later. I sleep on and off until the buzz of the alarm.) Instead, I lay there thinking about how hard he must have worked to pass it. After a while I start to realize that he was at my house a lot over the past two weeks. He would study, but not for Pro Tools, but Music History. It turns out that he had gone to study with some friends all day prior to the test. Somehow after one day of really intense studying, he had passed one of the hardest tests, if not the hardest, here at Full Sail. 

As I lay there, I continue to think about how I will be exiting that very same class in a matter of two months. I will not turn down the opportunity to take this test. However, before this phone call, there was no pressure on me. All of a sudden, I feel as if I must pass this test too. Casey and I had discussed him taking the test, but it resulted with the fact that he was going to take it, but there was no way he was going to pass it. I assumed that if he didn't pass, I would still be accepted when I failed as well. 

I don't always feel the need to compete with him, and I know that this is a very difficult test. Its just that I have worked so hard to not make an idiot of myself up to this point. So far, I have only kind of managed to do that. My GPA is as low as it was while I was in high school, but my grades are a lot higher than high school. I have two C's and no A's. Casey's GPA is as high as the sky, and forget about C's. The only grades on his transcript are a few B's and mostly A's. It seems that as the classes get harder, his grades get better. Sometimes I just think to myself that I will study harder. However, sometimes, it is hard to take more time to study. I have class at 9am and lab at 9pm. A lot of the time in between is study time. Yesterday I finished a test and left to study with a friend around 11:30am. I had an extra lab, so I left her house at 4. The entire time I was at her house, we were studying for a final. When I was in lab, all of what we did was study for this test. I still felt unprepared so I got home around 9pm from the lab and continued to study. Going to bed at midnight, I chose to get up early to study before the test. How could I study more? There isn't anymore time during the day. 

The rest of this is obvious: If I study this much already, when do I plan on studying more when Pro Tools comes around? What is going to happen if I fail? Am I going to care as much then as I do now? Things like this are silly to ponder, but I can't help it right now..."

"event","I have decided to start using this again. The reason being? No one reads this anymore, and I just need to vent sometimes. Why don't I use facebook, or hoverspot? Well, I guess I could use hoverspot since no one knows what that is. I'm not using facebook because too many people read that. With all of that said, there are somethings that I have been keeping inside for a while now:

You know there is something wrong when you are a girl, have been going to a 9:1 college for over six months, and still haven't been asked out. I know, that isn't what I'm here for, but after six months I just want something. There are plenty of nice guys here, why can't one of them find me a nice girl? I miss being loved. I had the perfect relationship. It had no faults... In a way, I want that one back...

Another thing, I'm sick of not having any close friends. Hanging out with only Casey for six months is just what I wanted... when we were dating. Don't get me wrong, we still get along great. I love having him around, passing along his musical knowledge, telling me funny stories, we have a great time. I just want more than him and the occasional movie with Noelia. I have plenty of friends, I just wish I hung out with them out of school...

My dad quit his job. I didn't really care until I realized how much it actually affected me. This could change how much Child Support gives me to live on, when/if I go visit, I can't see Jonathan, he lives two hours further from me. Not like he would have before, but now he really won't visit me.

I miss Vermont. I didn't think I would miss it this much, but right now, I kind of just miss my old life. A nice fall afternoon, heading to Rochester to see my wonderful boyfriend and his amazing family. Out of all of that, all I have left is an ex-boyfriend whom I still see... in Florida.

That is all. Don't worry, not all of them will be this sad. Despite what this may lead you to think, I actually love my life down here."

I just don't understand.

How about everyone who wants to run my life does, instead of them just telling me how much I am incapable of doing so. This way I don't have to feel bad about a single mistake that anyone (including them) would make. People are being ridiculous and I can't wait until graduation. Although I apparently can't do that either, regardless if it is in 14 days or not. I mean its just common knowledge that I'm just some fucked up ""voc kid"" that doesn't know shit about life, but when was the last time you thought about how many classes I'm actually taking. Okay, now add that onto drama (which is now over), all right now missing a whole week of classes, okay, now another three days, okay, now (get this)I still see my friends and family all the time. Next time someone wants to tell me how to run my fucking life, I want them to think about all of that and then go kill themselves, because that is how much I don't fucking care. Its not like they have to live it. If then want to, they can try to graduate early. Just as people said to me though, they couldn't do it... so fuck you.

I know that this was an ""emo"" post, but FUCK YOU. If you can come to me and tell me that you haven't ever had an ""emo"" thought, then I'll let it go, but until then, let me live my own fucking life. Trust me I'm wrong enough, its not like you need to rub it in my face every time.

Anyway, I'm talking specifically about the pages where people write to the magazine and explain things that they regret. Well I want everyone who reads this to write something that has been extremely embarrassing to them. Of course it should be anonymous. After you post it, however, you should reflect on everything that you have ever done that has been ""embarrassing"". Embarrassment is nothing. It is an emotion that should not be in existence. I'm not saying this because I have recently been embarrassed, I'm saying this because I have started to begin getting over this emotion. It is silly to be upset for those 5 minutes or however long it lasts. Why not laugh now so you can move on with more important issues in life? It is just silly I just don't understand."

"event","Yeah, it was. That is all there is say. Tonight will end with a smile on my face and happiness in the air. Casey ended up Throwing a flower at me when he unexpectedly showed up at Micah's for Snowball. It doesn't end there though. After he and I walked back to Micah's after the dance, he decided to explain the truth. Instead of going home that night, like he had previously told me, he was going to stay the night. Once again it doesn't end there, he revealed that he took the day off work the next morning. 

Snowball was good. I don't normally like these kinds of things, but I decided to go anyway. I am so glad that I went. I spent time with friends, I looked nice, and just had a good time. The music sucked, well most of it. Which means almost all of it. Oh well, life is good.

School was good today. I got a 97 on a math test I thought I was going to fail. I witnessed Steve and his praying mantis. He tried it on Brian and thought he killed him. (Brian was unharmed.) The best part was when T.J. and Eric could not stop laughing for about ten minutes. In driver's Ed we took a test and then had this thing where we can earn 25 extra points. If anyone knows what Christmas carol also means this phrase, they should tell me. ""Jehovah deactivate Blithe Chevaliers""

Okay, that is pretty much it, I'm going to get food now. Oh and if Katie reads this, ""I'm really sorry, I forgot to see you before I left tonight. We'll figure something out."""

Anyway, when I came home I started to work on Christmas presents. More specifically, Casey's Christmas present. During my ventures, I began to realize that what I'm tying to accomplish is near impossible. I know that is like every other thing I try to do, but this is different. It is really hard. Not only that, I don't know if I can do it. It gets worse though. Since I am spending most of my thought into this one gift, I haven't even thought about another. That's right ladies and gentlemen, no Christmas presents at all this year! I'm just kidding. Although it would be a wise decision on my part, I could not see that happen. My friends are important to me. They are what keep the world tuning. They deserve something. I do not go through this every Christmas, but when I do, it makes me wonder why traditions are kept alive. I really don't understand it. I also really hate Christmas. I could look you in the eye and promise that I hate presents. They are a waste of money, time, energy, everything. Most of the stuff that I get I throw away anyway. I have too many possessions already, why would I want more? So I can feel guilty about living like a king when I have a foster brother in Haiti that doesn't even know what a nintendo is? That is the best feeling in the world, let me tell you. 

Yeah, I hate holidays. (Even the word itself is weird.)"

Teachers make you ask to go to the bathroom. Worse than that though is when they turn you down. Come on it is a natural body function. It needs to happen. Even worse than that though is when they won't let you go for a long time as in the whole block.

The kid I watched screamed for 10 minutes straight. The funny part was when her mom asked me if she screamed for long and I told her ten minutes she goes, ""10 minutes?! Did you really scream that long?"" To her daughter, Wendy goes ""Yes"" in this baby voice. It was funny. I guess it wasn't so much a downfall.

The highlights of my day:
A table fell on my leg and there was a camera on the table, so I had to save that.

My history teacher paid me to watch her kid for a few minutes.

Went to Rochester with Alison.

Got my first 100 on a notebook quiz this year. Yay for tessellations!

I consumed Broccoli.

I danced like no one was watching... even though most of the time no one was there.

Saw amazing people who I love to see. (Alison, Micah, David, Casey)

Anyway, when she came home she gave me a pile of papers that she had printed out on the cars that are operated on vegetable oil. She was fascinated with the idea. I started reading the material and it said something about how they are as efficient as diesel cars. Now, I admit that I know nothing when it comes to gas mileage in any car, but don't diesel cars get really bad mileage? That is what I thought at least. What do you know about these cars?

Alright so in Media we have an exam-like assignment. It is really cool because we have to come up with an idea for a movie and meet the requirements. Since all the girls in the class were assigned to be in the same group, we thought it would be funny to make a ninja movie. Everyone in the class is going to end up in this movie, the guys are going to be our slaves/zombies, and Mr. Croney is the bad guy. This is going to be so much fun. Today we went out and bought ninja weapons and finished planning out our movie. Tomorrow we are going to bing in our outfits and start filming! I can't wait! I hope there is school.

Okay, for those of you who don't know, that's a lot of work. Not only did I finish all of this, which required re-shooting, I figured out what my tech project will be, if David agrees, and what I want to do for a career! I want to create a music video for my tech project. Casey and Micah of Victory's Requiem agreed, I just need David's approval. He would have to be patient with me and help with ideas. (Just to update you David.) I was hoping to use Hypocrisy but feel free to add your opinion. 

As for my career, no one will believe me but I thought about it and it would be cool to work at a recording studio.

In addition to that, I have just gained the understanding of the real reason for the lack of Mage this boring day. This is for everyone that was supposed to be in the Randolph campaign: The campaign was broken. This is why there was not a Mage session this morning. It was not because Micah had many things to do, it was because the campaign was broken. The reason I speak this ill news to you, is to assure you the proper answer, not a lie like I was given.

I could be doing any of the following: Deciding on a tech project, Shooting foliage crap, Working on an English assignment, Math homework, Going for a walk, Practice this new song that I can't sing, Playing games on the computer, or a million other things to keep myself busy. Am I doing any of that though? No, I'm sitting here typing in this worthless journal that no one reads except me. Everyone was so glad for this day off, including me, however my thoughts turn otherwise now. 

Mage was canceled for today. My only plans went down the drain. We were supposed to play from 10-2, so it wasn't that long anyway. At least my mind would be focused though. Oh well, who needs organization anyway? Me and probably more than that. 

I have no idea why, but I have been thinking more than I should be about next year, and college. Those thoughts come and go all with the same after feeling. Every one leaves me with the ""What the hell am I doing?"" thought and feeling. Sometimes they even leave me wondering why I bother hanging out with people or getting involved in things I love doing. Honestly, does it matter if I end up close to these people? I'm leaving in less than two years anyway. I know everyone says that two years is far away, but its not. Last year flew by so fast, and this one is continuing that tradition.

I have now been sitting here for a good 30 minutes trying to explain how I feel, (See how hard that was?) and now... I don't even know what to do with this. Should I even post it? I don't see why, who will read it? Okay, I herby declare anyone who reads this will gain one dollar. To claim your prize call 1-800-545-9999 then call me to claim you dollar.

I thought about about going to my dad's at the end of this month. Why ""thought"" is in past tense? Well my dad happens to live on an island in Savannah Georgia and there is another tropical storm named Tammy. This one is luckily not supposed to hit the gulf, but hit Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. (If anyone dares to speak a word of the Carolinas not existing, be sure to have a copy of your will and perfect funeral next time you come in contact with me. I warn you, it will be used.) So I have Thursday, October 20- Sunday, October 23 free. 

You know, Casey brought up a very good point the other day. With all of these hurricanes it really makes me wonder. Now if you're not a religious person this won't matter to you... so no one I know should read this. God promised that he would never flood the world again, right? Well isn't true that New Orleans is still flooded? Either way, let me finish. Casey brought up the point that if the earth starts flooding, everyone who is religious is screwed. Now think about this. These people have put how much devotion into this belief that they are sure is right, only to discover that it was all a lie. Just like Santa, it all deteriorates into nothingness. Meaningless literature becomes one giant fairy tale that millions of people used to perceive as ""The Answer"" to everything or ""The Good News"" to life. Everything that they have lived for, every minute they have spent worshiping, it was all for nothing. Just a big waste of time, like the whole McDonald's corporation. On the other hand, will they be too into another portion of the bible to even notice that this is clearly written in the text? Will they be blinded by this tragic news to even think about the only book that matters to them? The only thing I can say against this thought is that what if it is not God that floods the earth, but us? People we are killing the Ozone. Well no one cares, Let Global Warming come..."

So, David comes home tomorrow night. I can't wait. Casey is excited from what I can tell. I bet David is excited too. Casey left today and since David comes home tomorrow, God only knows when I am going to see him again. I'm fine with it though (even though no one will believe me). Yeah, I'm going to miss the everyday Casey fix, but you know what, all I have to do is think about how happy he is going to be those precious hours that he is with that boy of his. That makes me happy enough for everyone else in this crazy group of friends.

So my birthday is in nine days. I'll be 17!!! Casey gave me a magic card and a terrible blink-182 CD. Seriously I didn't want anything, but I would have gotten something for him too. The thing with me though, is that I would rather he did something for me (He is still taking me on a walk). I just hate people spending money on birthdays. It's pointless. Meh, what can you do? Tradition sucks!!! My mom wanted to take me on a cruise, I said no way. Not only am I terrified of boats, but it is way too much money, especially for my mom and me.

Apple Soup Shit is the hot new dessert that is served when you have nasty dinner guests over. How to make it you ask? It's as easy as 1, 2, 3. All you have to do is use two different recipes to make one apple pie. This is where you end up in disaster. Apple Soup Shit has a bitter, salty crust with an extra sweet filling. This makes it perfect for all of your bipolar friends. If any frustration arises while in the baking mode, simply find your new happy place (the one that wasn't eaten by sharks) and continue. If you have questions on where to find Apple Soup Shit, feel free to call Lainie or me to answer them.

I'm really sorry that we delayed you walking guys. I really had good intentions, but at least I created a new dessert. I love you Casey, you were the only one to dare to try it... don't forget that the emergency number is 911 if you need it. Also, it won't hurt my feelings one bit if you don't eat another bite.

Now that I think about it, I wish I could. Once again. society is holding me back. I bet if we weren't told that it was impossible to disappear, we'd be able to. I give up.

                Society sucks!!"

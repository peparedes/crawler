"event","Another lazy sunday for me. I was working on my spanish hw but i decided to do this instead. Nordquest was AWSOME yesterday even though Panda wasnt there :( But I still did get to see all of the people I love...Im gonna miss soo many of the seniors! I mean I didnt last year except for Kendall and David but thats because I was new and didnt know anybody..But this year...this year is gonna be totally tough! I mean PAtrick is leaving!I wanted his last practice to be nice, but I dont think he enjoyed it very much. I mean he told me that it was ok, but that he was tired of the same old same old. Which in a way kinda scares me. Summer... is so soon, and its really exciting but also its bittersweet. What if Pat does go away to San Jose or the other places he applied to? I mean he says that he will probably just go to the JC but then what? Im kinda wondering what is going to happen between us. I love him, more then anyone I have ever dated. I mean, sure he can be a lil bitch sometimes but I still love him for it, it even makes me laugh sometimes how much I do. It's just like the old song ""Cant help Loving that man of mine."" Now I dont want to just look ahead and worry. I wont, but once in a while I kinda have to prepare myself for whats coming next...but anyways I have to go shopping! YAY!! lol and I took a really dumb quiz...IM a hat??? weird.....

"event","I feel like a total loser AND winner... Loser in the fact that Im a dork for getting excited over a web page and Winner over the fact that I FINALLY figured out how to put pictures on my journal!! Hurray for me! Ok...that done...now what?

Well the play is going great, and Im now realizing that im using this just like I would a personal private journal...how creepy...But hey, I feel like I dont really have anything to hide, and plus, no one goes on here anyways...unless I put up naked picturres...But i WONT!!! ;) Anyways the play is cool, but im kinda having a lack of self conifadence in my acting...maybe its just me but it feels like people are laughing at me when Im doing a scene, and not even a funny scene...oh well I dont really care, Im gonna rock! :)

School is total blah, and I know that sounded really stupid of me but I dont care, Im just ready for summer to come and take me away. Im tired of all the commitment to school and grades and homework! ALL i want to do once i graduate is go into Broadway and continue Ballroom dancing and see where it takes me...hopefully to many glamorous award shows (EH HEM...OScars!) but who knows... I mean I know that I wont change my ideas, I havent since I was 3. My parents just want me to do really well in school, and I do, but i dont really enjoy it anymore..

Wow that was really boring oh well, on a nicer note I got to have a nice quality chat with Tyler today, I am really realizing how much I missed him. He was always a really cool guy, that hasnt changed. He is just so sweet, aww. It was nice to get to talk to him today. 

UGH stupid Rhetoric Homework which i am avoiding...oh well I might as well get back to the drawing board...but first...I MUST put up some kind of a picture....

"event","SO yesterday was just filled with non stop dance! First it was from 9-12 with the Nords, with was a total blast, even though I was extremely tired! Then after that Pat came over and we attempted to work on our runtine... and basically got nothing done. Im really worried about it. I mean I have wanted to compete with my bf ALL YEAr and I have been waiting for this FOREVER! But it doesnt seem like we can pull it together...Its sad. Im such an optiamist, and I really feel like we can do it...but I dunno, it shall be interesting. I want PAt to do a rutine that he enjoys because its his last year, but he is being SO indicisive, but I just want him to be happy. Oh well, I can only hope for the best. Anyways Turnabout was also that night and it was really fun! Except for that our dinner took like 2 HOURS!!!! NEVER EVER go to the Chili's in Rhonert Park! Its awful! lol BOycot!! anyways here are some great pics before the dance.

"event","DOnt you just LOVE old songs that bring back such great memories? Well I do. And I have a GREAT song for you that will just put a smile on your face. Basically ANY Kc and Jojo song, its just makes me remember old middle school dances of yester year. The times when life was a lot simpler and happier, and the only thing that was bad was if you werent asked to dance for the last slow song. Right now, Im listening to ""tell me its real"" with my best friend Miranda... no better feeling in the world. Just me and her singing it along with the boys, and swaying without even realizing it. It makes me smile effortlessly. :) I recommend everyone to just listen to an old song that was always played at your middle school dances, it will be great, I promise. And do this with a good friend, it will be twice as good."

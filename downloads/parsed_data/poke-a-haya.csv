"event","It's been a while, but accidentally breaking one's electronic journal does that...

Well, I do think that Hiryuu has gotten faster, as has Kimi. They seem to be defeating the wild pokemon we come across faster as well. I'm glad they are getting stronger, though..."

"event","I found out recently that Hiryuu can evolve, though it takes a Steel Coat and trading him to do so......

I'm not sure if I would want to do that. He has become a good friend, not to mention a god sparring partner as well. I'm iffy on the idea of trading him off just to make him strong...I find that he's plenty strong as it is, though...I think I need to ask him about it.

Not yet, though. Later.

On a different note, Kimi has been getting along better with Hiryuu and I lately, and I can only think it's for the better. We got into a two on two battle the other day. I guess fighting side&nbsp; by side with each other smoothed over some of the hostilities."

"event","Found a nice little coffe shop yesterday. They make this drink called a Caramel Macchiato, and damn if I'm not addicted to it already. It's vanilla syrup, milk, foam, and espresso topped with caramel sauce....I think I might have to go get another one today.....

((OOC: Sorry, I work at Starbucks and I must have made at least two dozen of them within the last day...))"

"event","Well, it's been a year....And a long one at that. Hiryuu, my Scyther, has improved his skills greatly, and training with him has made sure my own have not dulled. Kimi, my Skarmory, is still a bit of a nag, but bot Hiryuu and I know it's just because she cares. She has improved as well, her speed is impressive and her attacks are getting harder and coming faster.

Though, all this training does make me miss home, though I know I can never return. I mean, I don't think Konoha is ready for the dead to live again outside of a forbiden jutsu.....

......I remember being told by Officer Jenny that I could not use my techniques on the people and Pokemon here but....I wonder if I could &lt;i&gt;teach&lt;/i&gt; them to my Pokemon....at least the ones that do not require seals...I don't think claws and wings can handle them..."

"event","Hello, as this is my first journal entry, I will begin by giving you a brief statement about who I am and why I started this journal. 
<br>
I am a 32 year old female, practicing non-wiccan witch and former sex worker. I started this journal as a way to discuss the more private aspects of my life anonymously but still explore the feedback others might have to offer. I call myself a maenad because Dionysus is the god I have always <i>felt</i> the most, although I am not a Greek Reconstructionist. I will elaborate more as this journal progresses."

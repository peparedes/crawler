All around me are familiar faces worn out places, worn out faces bright and early for their daily races going nowhere, going nowhere their tears are filling up their glasses no expression, no expression hide my head I want to drown my sorrow no tomorrow, no tomorrow and I find it kinda funny I find it kinda sad the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take when people run in circles It's a very, very mad world mad world children waiting for the day they feel good happy birthday, happy birthday made to feel the way that every child should sit and listen, sit and listen went to school and I was very nervous no one knew me, no one knew me hello teacher tell me what's my lesson look right through me, look right through me and I find it kinda funny I find it kinda sad the dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take when people run in circles It's a very, very mad world ... world enlarging your world <b>Mad world<b>

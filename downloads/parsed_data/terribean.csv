"event","<P>We went to the Fair Oaks Dairy Farm today for a tour. &nbsp;It was really cool.&nbsp; The milking parlor is a huge carousel where the cows get on one at a time, it holds like 65 at a time.&nbsp; It was amazing to see how clean it was considering there are 3,000 cows per barn and over 12,000 cows in the whole facility.&nbsp; And the best part is that the whole thing is managed by one veterinarian with 18 staff per 3,000 cows.&nbsp; This probably doesn't mean anything to you guys, but I'm a bit of a nerd when it comes to cows.</P>
<P>Ok, so my great aunt gave me a list of quotes she thought I would like called The Wisdom of Will Rogers. &nbsp;I hope you get as much entertainment from them as I did.&nbsp;<BR> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Don't squat with your spurs on.</LI>
<LI>Never slap a man&nbsp;<FONT color=#000000>who's </FONT>chewing tobacco.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Never kick a cow chip on a hot day. </LI>
<LI>There are two theories about arguing with a woman.&nbsp; Neither one works. </LI>
<LI>Never miss a good chance to shut up. </LI>
<LI>Always drink upstream from the herd.</LI>
<LI>If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.</LI>
<LI>The quickest way to double your money is to fold it and put it back in your pocket.</LI>
<LI>There are three kinds of men.&nbsp; The ones that learn by reading.&nbsp; The few who learn by observation.&nbsp; The rest of them have to pee on the electric fence for themselves.</LI>
<LI>Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment. </LI>
<LI>If you're riding ahead of the herd, take a look back every now and then to make sure it's still there.</LI>
<LI>Letting the cat out of the bag is a whole lot easier than putting it back.</LI>
<LI>After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he started roaring.&nbsp; He kept it up until a hunter came <FONT color=#000000>along </FONT>and shot him...&nbsp; The moral: When you're full of bull keep your mouth shut. </LI></UL>
<P><BR>Oh yeah &nbsp;GO COLTS!!!!!!!! 11-0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Who said we couldn't beat the <FONT color=#000000>Steelers</FONT>?<BR></P>"

"event","YAY, I'm posting (insert celebratory remarks here)!!!  So I've had the month from hell.  I've already taken two finals, two oral exams that lasted over a half hour each, miscellaneous quizzes and lab reports, and have another half hour oral and Physiology exam to look forward to the week after break.  And this all happened in the past two weeks.  Ok, so the depressing part's over.  At least I'm done for right now.  I'm watching Gilmore Girls and Supernatural, contemplating cleaning my filthy apartment.  

For those of you who don't know, I have signed a lease for a new apartment.  I'll be moving in August 2006.  It's a one bedroom on the second floor, so I'll actually be able to use my balcony.  I'm sorry to all the football cronies because it won't be as large as you're used to, but I will still have the futon free for a slumbering traveler.  Anyway, It'll be good to live on my own.  Time has made me a very picky person and I don't deal well with roommates anymore, I'm sure some of you can understand.

Plans for the holiday are to eat as much as I can, which shouldn't be hard.  I have the Bray, Pickett, and Byerly dinners (that's dad's, mom's, and nate's families respectively).  I think I'll be spending a lot of time in the CoRec next week :).

Angie, I sympathize with the heater problem, except I had the opposite problem.  Our heat would not turn on.  All fixed now, they gave us a new thermostat and I don't have to wear long underwear just to watch tv anymore (sure you all wanted to know that, huh).

Ok, so I'm going to go be productive and take my aggressions out on the dirt and grime that has taken up residence here.  Take care and have a great Thanksgiving.  

P.S.: Since this is a time to think about what we're thankful for, I made a list.  It's something I suggest everyone does, puts things in perspective.

1)Family
2)Nate
3)Friends
4)Place to live
5)Student loans
6)I'm in vet school
7)Heater works :)
8)I'm not hungry
9)I have a God that loves me
10)Well, to sum the rest up....I'm alive"

"event","So it was Fox's 21st birthday today.  We went to the cactus to celebrate.  I thought I would be back by 12:00 so I could get some sleep, but seeing as how I'm posting at 1:27 we all see how that worked out.  Anyway, we had fun and fox and my roommate are happily doing whatever it is they do.  I'm thinking about bed.  I've had a physiology exam on wednsday, then a physiology quiz today (whoever scheduled that needs to be shot) and I get to turn in an ethics paper tomorrow.  So, it's been a long week.  Anyway, for those of you who are coming for the game, I'll see you, well, today.  Otherwise, I am as always your friend."

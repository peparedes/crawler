and then lauren fell asleep....and me and brittany ended up makin out for the end of that shitty movie...well it wasnt that shitty but ive seen much much better....and um ya.....then we decided to flip through music videos.....

um ya....i just heard some noises from the kitchen and fliped out but its just my sister on the couch.....and she has no clue that i just came home.....what a dummy lol.....

and then i decided to come home so my parents werent awake when i got here.....and then lauren went upstairs....i gave brittany a little goodnight kiss and went home....and here i am....um....i dont know whats goin on....and i think i should go upstairs and think about it and sleep and what not....and um....ya...i dunno

....for the record brittany is a good kisser....

tonight was a shit load of fun.....lets see today was actually quite interesting lets start at the begining....

i woke up from a lovely dream that i sadly cannot remember but it was one of those dreams that you stay in bed for becuase you are very much enjoying it and you fall back asleep to continue it.....so at about 2 i finally got out of bed lol......i showered then took off to cash some excess graduation checks that i had.....got me some money and went and picked up my copy of sticks and stones.......the new nfg album......quite enjoyable.......then i drove to paules wtih hopes of returning matts jeep.....yes its a lot of fun to drive and all but its not mine and my parents arent thrilled that im borrowing someones car......he wasnt there......and i was gonna leave the keys with perry but i couldnt find someone to pick me up.....so i left.....and went to andrea's....hung out and talked with her for a bit....i love her soo much.....but i dunno.....its complicated and i cant get into it right now....because the kicker of this journal is yet to come.....i left andrea's and went to...............i bet the suspense is killing you now...............ya.....chris frank's...(for those of you who dont know catch me at a time when neither of us is busy, its a rather long story)  but ya....chris was there......and i actually hung out with him......????????.........and we had a good time...........?????????............we called milo and went to mars music so i could get new strings for both my guitars.......then we went and got burger king and my guitar and me and chris played music and chilled and shit and it really was a lot of fun.....and its really strange......i actually miss hanging out with him we used to have so much fun together.....and we did again tonight......and i told him how much he pissed me off when the only time he called since he graduated was to tell me if i wanted to see him i could pay $15 to see hydrosonic........and he told me that he didnt at all mean it the way i took it.....but still.....it pissed me off like no tomorrow......and we are over it and ya....i hung out with chris? lol im still confused about this whole thing....its mind boggling.....lol well ya thats about it and supposedly hydrosonic isnt a group of losers that are stupid and assholish and all and they actually might be getting signed....go chris........well thats about it.......

and a quick side point.......chris and milo and such no longer hang with donald.....go chris and milo.....he was much more of a dick than chris could every try to be....and besides donald is fruity and balding lmao and a male whore.....

""Hey we want to
know if
u have a girlfriend
what shool you go
to and how old
u are?

We are 15
I go to piper (purple shirt) and
I go to McFatter (white shirt)
My name is Dana (white shirt
and mine is Eti (purple shirt)

If u want call us
 * * * - * * * *
ask for Dana
answer the Q?'s we'll
be outside.""

first off there are no typo's or anything....that is exactly how it was written line for line and of course i wouldnt post the phone number in the journal.....
but the girl in the white shirt was the cute one.....the purple was not so cute
and hey....the cute one is the one whose phone number i got and she goes to McFatter which means she is pretty bright too.... sadly it is illegal lol"

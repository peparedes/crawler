"event","I've fallen again, I believe.  That's what happens when you crawl upon a high horse, you get kicked off and fall.  The fall hurts an insane amount, but you're told if you're strong you are supposed to get back up, saddle up, and ride your high horse again until you've reached your destination.  I've been kicked off so many times already, but for once I thought I had the hang of riding. Lately, without warning or complaint, I've began to slip.  It wasn't noticeable at first, the bruises were small, the cuts not deep. Now I have fallen off completely.  I am broken at the hooves of my horse, he is neighing at me from above.  He wants to move, for me to get back on and ride him again. Me, I don't know if I have the strength.  I am deciding what to do.  

Do I Have The Strength To Move On . ?

"event","Well, yesterday with Dayn was a blast, as usual.  We had our activites, did something new, and had a grand old time cuddling and such.  We hung out for awhile actually, longer than I thought, then he dropped me off at Linnas. She wasn't home yet, so I went to Ant's, we hung, Linna and Courtney came back we went to get stoges, hung otu for a bit, walked COurt home, and went back to LInna's.  We didn't do much, becuase I had to leave to meet up with Dom to go to the show.  

So I meet Dom at the bridge, and Mike and Jay are there too! <3.  I missed them.  Mike likes tieing my shoes.  Anyway, Mike siad he'd be there later and me and Dom walked to the Legion.  A few moments later, we arrived, and I saw people as soon as I got there.  I felt so loved, everyone was around, hugging, kissing, joking, I felt like I was truely wanted around, truely happy.  I thought to myself ""maybe it won't be so bad tonight"". 

As Mike, Dom, and I sat on the steps to the legion, I saw a hunky old blue car pull into the parking lot  ""Dom, its Trevor, I'll bet you any money"".  I was right, but we didn't bet. So, he sat far away from me, as usual, and I continued meeting up with friends and hugging, and kissing, and beign in my blissful state of mind.  The badns last night sucked until PT Grimm.  No matter what Dayn says, I <3 them.  Anyway, since the bands were so horrid, I was downstairs with my friends, having this great time, and I wish it could have lasted.  

I started seeing Trevor with some whore, her name was Melissa I believe.   So, I went upstairs so I wouldn't have to be around it, and I turned around, and there they were.  SO I went back downstairs, and it happened again.  This went on for about a half hour, until they hooked up. That, I didn't appreciate, because he ahd asked me not to do so infront of him.  

After this, I was shaking incontorllably, I wasn't a happy girl.  I went to go upstairs, to see PT Grimm, and he happened to be in the range of where I was flicking my cigarette, and it may have fallen on his ankle or something.  Anyway, he turned around, grabbed my purse ripping it, trying to 'talk' to me.  He then threw me against the wall.  I broke away, and went upstairs.  I was shaking, physically shaking, Mike Montone opened his arms and I started crying.  I walked away and went by Dayn.  I told him everything, and he also, opened his arms to me.  Soon everyone around me was buzzing, and quite worried.  

I went back downstairs, and attmepted to got by Michele, but she was with him.  So Iw ent by Mike and them.  Mike told me to go over there and slap him accross the face, I told him Iw ouldn't, but I di go over there.  We started screamign at eachother, words were exchanged, and the next thing I knew, my handprint was left across his left cheek.  Afterwords, I collapsed into Joe Yakoubian's arms, and cried until Felicia pulled me of of him.  I am heartbroken, but I will be okay.

I really need Victoria now, but she seems to be too tied up in her own life.

We'll have this amazing conversation, and I'll know everythin I feel for him, and then after a couple days, it fades.  But now we've been having these really amazing conversations a lot, and I've been seeing him a lot.  Its not fading.  It irritates me because before, you know,  I could ignore it, but now, I can't.  We're hanging out today, soon probaby.  He's waking up at 10, its 934.

I didn't want to fall for him, but I couldn't help it.

Anyway...

Works been a blast.  Made 50 bucks the other day. Nice.

PT Grimm show today.  Can't wait.  I haven't seen Linna in forever.

I'm really proud of Ant, been hanging around with him a lot.  Good massages.  He's maturing a lot, I'm amazed.

I started a new job, workign with my grandfather, using a computer to lay out graphics and text for signs, weeding all of it out, and placing it on the sign itself.  Its good field experience.  And its waaay better than bussing.  I don't know how much it pays yet, I don't want to ask, lol. Ontop of that, Hector and I have the startings of a band.  I've been hanging out with Ant too.  ANd erg, avoiding Trevor. Last night alone, he called me <b><i> four</b></i> times.  Ugh.

Yesterday Dom and Jay stopped by, twas delicious. Then me and mommy went to go see Farenheit 9/11.  I knew most of the facts, except that, yah know. Bush's oil companies, the Bin Ladens funded it, and oh- they all went bankrupt.  And of corse that we let the Bin Ladens leave the country 2 days after 9/11, wihtout questining.  -Or- the Saudi Arabia owns you know, only 7% of us. And if they were to take our their financial backing, our country would go bankrupt.  Decietful little Bush.  I'm going Democrat, well, if I could vote.

Anyway, Friday I'm hanging out with Joe, and Saturday is the show, Sunday I think I may be going to the movies, and then Monday is Joe's party, and Tuesday, me, mommy, and Dom are going down the shore to Oartley, where Do's mommy, and sister, are. <3!  I <3that entire family.  Mucho grand elove mi amors.

I <3 Linna too.  I NEED to stop by there soon. I miss her soooo much.  She's such a sweety.

I <3 Rabbit.  I'm worried about her, but I <3 her anyway.  I wanna see her soon too.  I haven't seen her in like, two weeks.

I'm rpoud of Anthony. He's actually working on what he said he'd work on.  But I don't know if he knows what he needs to do now.  If I have time to go over there today, I'll see if he wants to talk about shit like that. 


Carlos is supposed to come over today too.  We're goin' swimming.  I haven't seen him since the last day of school.  He dumped Donna while she was on vaca...that's sad, AND funny.

Saw Drew, Linna thinsk he's a hottie, and he so is.  lol. Saw a lot of people.  Then we went to the movies that are right there, and hung out with Hector and Pete, saw Dodgeball. Came back to the mall, saw Meeshy and Lora, and then the wildcard - Trevor.  Ugh.  I really love that kid, and I hate it.  We had this really long conversatin last night about how much we really do love eachother, but now isn't the time.  We ended up crying.  It was beatiful.  I hate him, and what he does to me. 

Today, was also a wonderful day. Hung out with Linna again. <3!  We went to Ant's. He bit me, and tickles me. We got into a pillow/pineapple fight.  Lovable.  I suck at Mario.  Went back to Linna's. Conversed for a long time.  I hoep Ant does change for the better.

"event","Here I am, another rainy night, typing in my dimly lit living room.  My mother is to my left, reading a book, and twisting her hair, my dog below her feet sleeping, behind me, the TV is on, and tuned to channel 38, Law & Order : SVU.  I've had time to think today, lots of it.  Jesse and I were supposed to hang out, but as usual he never called when he said he would.  THis has become very typical of Jesse, and it annoys me, because there was one time when we wouldn't go two days without talking, and now we go months.  This week was a somewhat relaxed week compared to the rest of my summer, I hung out with Linna for a bit, played softball, hung out with Dayn twice and went down the shore. There's not much else to that.  Tomorrow, I think I'm going to swim a lot, and for once, I'm not asking anyone over. I'm just going to swim laps. Its very calming to me swimming laps. It makes me feel flawless, and beautiful.  

I probably won't talk to Dayn this weekend, and I wish I could because I want to apologize for not being able to go yesterday, again, and to make sure his sister is doing. SHe had surgery, and I want to make sure she's recovering alright. I believe he went to Hellfest this weekend, yes - all weekend.  I was amazed he actually wanted to hang out twice this week. Usually I have to -push- to hang out with him even once in a week.  On top of that, he invited me over both times-insane. I've decided that I don't have feelings for him.  Its just our insane friendship, and maybe a bit of lust.  Perhaps one day there might be something there, or perhaps not, that relies on him, not me.

Speaking of feelings, I've uncovered some that I'm not particularly fond of.  Trevor, I'm massively in love with the boy, and its taking every bit of strength in me not to call him and tell him I want him back.  I'm not even sure if he'd take me now anyway, and I know this way is the best way for now.  I hope that in the future we'll be together, because I want to be together in future. I love him, and that's the god's honest truth.

I love you all.

Yesterday, Spent the day at Dayn's again.  Mmm.. You know how I said I'd wait for him to coem by my and ike...pull me closer, well I didn't have to wait.  Usually he sits in his chair for about a half hour befor ehe comes and lays down next to me.  yesterday, once I got there, we looked for the remote, and plopped down on the bed together, and first thing he did was put his arm around me <3!.  Adorable.  Anyway, we spent the dy cuddling a lot.  I think I needed to cuddle yesterday after what we had talked about the night before.  I think his mom had a clue about us hooking up. She almost caught us yesterday. ""Hmm, I dunno when my mom's comign home from the hospital, should be soon"" ...""okay?""...and then the kissing commences.  ::door slam:: ::jump back::. So cute. Anyways.   He didn't seem to want me to like, you know.. get off of him.  He's cute.  Ah wells.  In my photobucket, i think I'm going to put all the funny pictures I made of him up in a segment called ""Dayn...or not?"" lol.  Yup.

I'm really worried about my rabbit.  She's my best friend, and she's been so down lately she hasn't even wanted her carrots.  Well rabbit, I'll keep trying, and I love you.  And once softball's over, you can come over anytime, and me too, yah know?  I love you Rabbit!

"event","<P>SO last night, I had this conversation with Dayn, it was the first real conversation I have had with him in a long time.&nbsp; Its usually just minor complaints, jokes, and observations, but last night we had a conversation that I think we needed to have so we knew where we stood. I'm not sure what the outcome will be, but I respect Dayn now more than I think I ever have.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out ocnversation was about us, say, proceeding, with what we do, onto the last step.&nbsp; He told me he has been juggling with the topic which made me pleased to know I'm not the only one who thinks about it.&nbsp; If it comes, it comes, if it doesn't it doesn't.&nbsp; I don't want him to regret anything, and he's one who does that regretting thing.&nbsp; And its understandable that he'd regret having sex with me, because he's a virgin, and it beign his first time I could understand that he wants his first to mean something.&nbsp; If only he knew.&nbsp; I think more and more, I may be developing something for Dayn again, but I'm not sure if its just an old flme that lights up from blowing on embers or if its real.&nbsp; I'm going to gnore it as much as ignore every other thing in my heart.&nbsp; </P>
<P>My heart's damaged, so I, in all honesty, am in no place to be having a relationship, and because of this, I know that any feelings I do feel should not be expressed or acted upon.&nbsp; We'll just do what we do and let whatever comes, comes.&nbsp; I don't think I'll make the first move anymore though, and I'll only lay on him when he pulls me over, just to be sure that he's okay with it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Sex doesn't mean too much to me, due to my rape and molestation.&nbsp; My childhood has effected my negatively and positively in so many ways that I can't find myself to hate it, or the people in it.&nbsp; Most people can't understand that.&nbsp; Sex is little more than meaningless to me, and that's sad because when I was younger, even while I was being molsted,&nbsp;I wanted to 'save' myself, for that very special someone when I was older, but in the end, that was stolen for me, and sex became routine.&nbsp; Now, I enjoy sex, but it does't have to mean anything, it can, but doesn't have to.&nbsp; I can seperate myself from things like that now, simply because of my childhood.&nbsp; All I know grewing up was sex, and groping.&nbsp; I started masturbating when I was 4.&nbsp; Its sad, and it hurts my relationships and friendships to this day,&nbsp; but someday&nbsp;I plan to concur this terrible misfortune this was bestoed upon me, and value the relations I have with people.</P>

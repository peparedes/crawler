She is a very selfish person and thinks on a totally different wave length than myself..

I buzzed her office and asked if she thought I could ever convince my grandfather to goto Scottland with me and she was like, ""Nooo.. he never would... He'd never pay for it either.""  The thought of him paying for it never crossed my mind. I want to take him home one last time..he brings me to tears talking about it. 

He's taught me so much I feel that it is the least I could do. Him and my grandmother are the only two people who have ALWAYS been there for me. I could never repay them with any amount of earthly goods."

Now I've done a string of horrible things
Like murdering, pillaging and theft
I've looted the junks in the Straits of Malacca
Put Spanish explorers to death
But prejudice would be the ugliest thing
For a waitress so lovely to feel

Is it because I'm a pirate
You seem to have cancelled our date?
And is it because I'm a pirate
That now it's a quarter to eight?
Your prejudice turns you against me
But I am prepared to wait

""I like your eyepatch!"" Who said that?
I took in your waist then your face
Floating above me, pouring out tea
In some Nakameguro place
And though it was rude to the girl I was with
I asked if you'd go for a date
And then when you said you'd be happy to meet
I dreamed of your breasts and your face

Is it because I'm a pirate
You seem to have cancelled our date?
Your prejudice turned you against me
And now it's a quarter past eight
A stereotype would be ugly
For someone so lovely to propagate

Of course I am wanted by customs officials
Of course I'm an international fugitive
When not slitting throats of the people in boats
I am kind and surprisingly sensitive
Set your mind free, as I know you can
One day you may see me as just another man

Is it because I'm a pirate
I seem to be stood up again?
And is it because I'm a pirate
It's already quarter to ten?
Life is too short, I am too great
For a waitress so lovely to hate
But I am prepared to wait"

I knew he was leaving, 
he sat on my bed told me some facts, son.
I have a duty, calling on me
You and your sister be brave my little soldier
And don't forget all I told ya
Your the mister of the house now remember this
And when you wake up in the morning give ya momma a kiss
Then I had to say goodbye

In the morning woke momma with a kiss on each eyelid,
Even though I'm only a kid 
Certain things can't be hid
Momma grabbed me 
Held me like I was made of gold 
But left her inner stories untold
I said, momma it will be alright 
When daddy comes home, tonight

Whether long range weapon or suicide bomber
Wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction
Whether you're soar away sun or BBC 1
Disinformation is a weapon of mass destruction
You could a Caucasian or a poor Asian
Racism is a weapon of mass destruction
Whether inflation or globalization
Fear is a weapon of mass destruction

Whether Halliburton or Enron or anyone
Greed is a weapon of mass destruction
We need to find courage, overcome
Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction 
The skin under my chin is exploding again
I'm getting stress from some other children
I'm holding it in.
We taking sides like a politician
And if I get friction, we get to fighting
I defend my dad, he's the best of all men
And whatever he's doing, he's doing the right thing
It's frightening, but it makes me mad
Why do all these people seem to hate my dad
And if that aint enough now I got these spots
I go to sleep every night with my stomach in knots
And what's more, I can hear momma next door
Explore the radio for reports of war
And all we ever seem to do
Is hide the tears
Seem like daddy been gone for years
But he was right
Now I'm geared up for the fight
And he would be proud of me
If my daddy come home tonight
Listen me calmly 

Whether long range weapon or suicide bomber
Wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction

Fear is a weapon of mass destruction

Whether Halliburton or Enron or anyone
Greed is a weapon of mass destruction
We need to find courage, overcome
Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction

My story stops here, lets be clear
This scenario is happening everywhere
And you ain't going to nirvana or farvana
You're coming right back here to live out your karma
With even more drama than previously, seriously
Just how many centuries have we been 
waiting for someone else to make us free
And we refuse to see
That people overseas suffer just like we
Bad leadership and ego's unfettered and free
Who feed one the people they're supposed to lead 
I don't need good people to pray and wait 
For the lord to make it all straight
There's only now, do it right. 
Cos I don't want your daddy, leaving home tonight"

I sat me with my true love.
My sad heart strove the two between
The old love and the new love.
The old for her the new
That made me think on Ireland dearly.
While the soft wind blew down the glade
and shook the golden barley.

T'was hard the woeful words to frame
To break the ties that bound us.
But harder still to bear the shame
of foreign chains around us.
And so I said the mountain glen
I'll meet at morning early.
And I'll join the bold united men
While soft winds shook the barley.

T'was sad I kissed away her tears
My fond arm round her flinging.
When a foe, man's shot burst on our ears
From out the wild woods ringing.
A bullet pierced my true love's side
In life's young spring so early.
And on my breast in blood she died
While soft winds shook the barley.

But blood for blood without remorse
I've ta'en at oulart hollow.
I've lain my true love's clay like corpse
Where I full soon must follow.
Around her grave I've wandered drear
Noon, night, and morning early.
With breaking heart when e'er I hear
The wind that shakes the barley."

Please don't disappear
I am spacing out with you
You are the most beautiful entity that I've ever dreamed of 
At night I will protect you in your dreams
I will be your angel
You worry so much about not having enough time together
It makes no difference to me
I would be happy with just one minute in your arms
Let's have an extended play together
You're telling me that we live to far to love each other
But your love can stretch further than you and I can see
So how does it make you feel? 
Do you know when you look at me
It is a salvation
I've been waiting for you so long
I can drive on that road forever
I wish you could exist to live on my planet
Well it's very hard for me to say these things in your presence

So how does it make you feel?

Even in there kind and decent actions there motives, although possibly not conscious are in the end to benefit themselves.. 

At all times we must remember, no one is really your friend..they are only using you for there temporary enjoyment..

Worst of all..no one really loves you, they are simply keeping you close due only to the fact that you bring the pleasure, relief from the horrible world that surrounds them.

No one and I mean no one does anything for anyone other than themselves, I can't make this clear enough...everyone, consciously or not, interact for the hope of personal gain only!"

(ie. the three Japanese skulls/skeletons thus far and soon to be added Japanese Koi with cherry blossoms and fingerwaves on the backside of my calf to my knee)

Current ""apprentice leg"" tattoos

Unfinshed, Japanese/Old School (also an Olivia oringinal)

Also a Horiyoshi original, only a few hours old
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v430/AE86/1.jpg"">

Now for my request, I'm looking for some artwork to fill the remaining areas of my lower leg (from the knee down) which will eventully be incorporated into one large piece. If you post something I like and isnt' to diffcult for the artist it will become a permanent part of my body.

As for the artwork:
MUST be of Japanese origin or comparable
Moderately diffcult
Original works are most appricated

The remaining areas:

You are a SEDL--Sober Emotional Destructive Leader. This makes you a Dictator.

You prefer to control situations, and lack of control makes you physically sick. You feel have responsibility for everyone's welfare, and that you will be blamed when things go wrong. Things do go wrong, and you take it harder than you should.

You rely on the validation and support of others, but you have a secret distrust for people and distaste for their habits and weaknesses that make you keep your distance from them. This makes you very difficult to be with romantically. Still, a level-headed peacemaker can keep you balanced.

Despite your fierce temper and general hot-bloodedness, you have a soft spot for animals and a surprising passion for the arts. Sometimes you would almost rather live by your wits in the wilderness somewhere, if you could bring your books and your sketchbook.

You also have a strange, undeniable sexiness to you. You may go insane.

The weather man tells me it will be a high of 90, low of 70 with a 10% chance of rain and partly couldy...I'm hoping this is the truth, I'm pumped about my race tomorrow. It's a small motorcross meet, 250cc 2stroke class followed by freestyle mx contest (which I suck to bad to enter). I should place in the motorcross race although I have gotten pretty fat and out of shape so there is really no telling. My ""friend"" Matt is running his CRF450R in the big boy class, this guy could easily turn pro if he put the time in..he is one of the best ridders I have ever seen.

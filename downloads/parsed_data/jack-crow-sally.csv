"event","You know what - there are a few things that have been bugging me lately


Like what happend to chivalry - or true love - or family and friends before work and yourself


Has everyone lost their fucking minds?!?!


I cant even begin to count the amount of times that i have seen the act of chivalry thrown aside - it sickens me that i dont see any men giving up their seat for a standing lady - or holding a door open for a woman with bags or a stroller - has everyone just given up on that kind of stuff - is money, good looks, and fame all anyone ever thinks about now a days? its getting kind of sad when the medieval times treated their women better than we do - granted women have changed as well - chivalry should not be dead.

Raise your hand if your one of the countless number of people that uses the phrase ""I love you."" every day - now raise your hand if you mean it - now i beleive whole heartedly that those three words should never be used unless you truly mean it - unfortuantly in this day and age more and more people seem to take those words for granted - when you say it to get someone to do something for you - when you say it just to make someone feel better - when you say it and are just playing with the person for shits and giggles - thats all i see now a days - couples are the worst - it used to be that those three simple little words used to be nothing simple at all - it used to be that when you said it you meant it and it was a long time before you said it to the one you were dating - now thats all i hear out of couples is ""i love you"" this and ""i love you"" that after dating eachother for a good day or two - then what do you know - about a week later their completly seperated dating other people with nothing to say of eachother but ""i never wanted to date her/him"" or ""i hate him/her"" - to me true love exists almost as much as my pet raptor, Gearald, that lives in my closet - sure there is true love out there somewhere but i havnt found it yet and i doubt i will.

And another thing - kind of going bak to the whole chivalry topic - people need to take time to help others - come on people - how hard is it to go out of your way for someone - to give up something of your own for someone else - whether it be time or possesions it shouldnt matter - this whole fucking planet needs a wake up call - if you cant give up five seconds to help someone out then you dont deserve any help from anyone else - unfortunately there are some people out there that really do give up tim and possesions just to be walked all over - not thanked not given anything in return - just taken for granted all that they do - when the person is chivalrous and gives up possesions for others - why is it that one person has the hardest time finding true love? why is it the one person who deserves to be truely loved has nothing - should the world just go back to ignoring eachother - will everyone be happier if the good ones stoped carring - or would it be that when the ones who care stop carring that the ones that take advantage of them will be completly and hopelessly lost - and will wish for them back.


Im just having a hard time seeing reality - whether or not i should give up trying to be the kind of guy that barely exists.






Well??"

"event","been having that dream again - while asleep and awake - that dream where the one you love the most - the one you long for every night - is in your embrace and you can feel and smell and taste her - when you lapse into a coma of sickness and pure extasy all at once - that feeling when the only two things on this planet are you and her - that feeling that if you were to die right at that moment it would be alright 

i dream this everynight and pray and wish to never awake from such a wonderfully perfect nightmare 


goodnight all 


im going to try to catch that dream again

how pathetic....."

<img
src=""http://live.quizilla.com/user_images/P/PainfulBliss/1117236077_Power_Transformation.JPG""><br><b>Your power is:</b> Transformation
<p align=""left""><br><b>Explanation:</b> Unlike everyone else you<br>can change your body materia and transform into<br>anything (e.g. an animal). This can be used in<br>good purposes for infiltrating evil<br>headcuarters or adjust your physical abilities<br>by transforming and therefor do better in<br>battle. If turned to the evil side, a<br>transfomer could manipulate the ""good<br>guys"" by looking like their loved ones and<br>break them down.<br>As a person you are dissapointed with life. You<br>have not so many interests anymore and has<br>become depressed. Of course you can be happy,<br>but your happiness subsides quickly and don't<br>last very long. You isloate yourself from<br>people since you think they would only hurt<br>you, but some part just wants someone equal who<br>understands the pain. When you transform it<br>gives you freedom and you can be anything but<br>yourself. You often pity yourself but don't let<br>people come near and know what's going on with<br>you. But the thought of opening up and risking<br>being betrayed is too strong and intimidating<br>to even try.<br><b>Negative aspects:</b> You carry much hate to<br>the world and yourself and in the long run this<br>could lead to dangerous thoughts<br>(suicide/cutting/killing) though the last one<br>is least likeable since you would probably just<br>have too much guilt. </p>

Torture and pain wrack my body,
The stress on my brain is literally unholy,
Soon i will crack and no one will see,
The truth of the matter locked inside me.
Curses running through my veins,
Anger and hate pulsing in bloody rains,
Taste of plasma on the tip of my lip,
Tells a false tale that i cannot quit.
That who does not notice,
The lies will come unfocused, 
Until the truth is blurred,
And to know it is a feat unheard.
Torn together,
Stitched apart,
Locked away,
Ill keep my heart."

Walking from portal to portal - glimps of your visage lighting all darkend passages - wondering if ill ever see you again - wishing to know your embrace - fear of losing sight once prison lets loose - not seeing the truth until too late - when no longer mortal, see you next - walking from portal to portal.

Words left unspoken, glances taken to the other direction, waves turned to another, hugs not shared, kisses not felt, stories not told, feelings not wept, emotion not shown, love not found, just because the words left unspoken never found their target and fell to the ground, without confidence or trust they they will never make a sound."

Run
Running all the time
Running to the future
With you right by my side

Me
I'm the one you chose 
Out of all the people 
You wanted me the most
I'm so sorry that I'm falling
Help me up lets keep on running
Don't let me fall out of love

[Chorus:]
Running, running
As fast as we can
Do you think we'll make it?
(Do you think we'll make it?) 
We're running
Keep holding my hand
It's so we don't get separated

Be
Be the one I need
Be the one I trust most
Don't stop inspiring me
Sometimes it's hard to keep on running
We work so much to keep it going
Don't make me want to give up"

<h2>Your Inner Sex Gender: Woman</h2>
For you, sex is the best possible emotional connection. It's all about making your head spin.<br>
You think twice about having sex with a stranger, unless you think romance is in the air.<br>
And you choose comfort over novelty. You rather have sex you know you enjoy.<br>
This doesn't mean you aren't kinky... just that you choose your kinks rather carefully.

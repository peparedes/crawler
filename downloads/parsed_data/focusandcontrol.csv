Characters in Taxon (if applicable): N/a

Character name: Scott Summers
Genre (TV/books/etc): Comics
Fandom: Marvel/X-Men

Canon point: Post ""The Search For Cyclops"" Mini-series(which was many moons ago)

Why this Character and Canon point?: Because Scott Summers has always been someone I enjoy writing, with the dichotomies of control vs. power, and of seemingly passionless exterior vs. interior full of passion. This canon point is a great example of that starting to break down as with his return, he turned a little more openly emotional, and a little more willing to push the edges. But he still concealed a lot, and showing him deal with things that way will be fun, I think.

Programmed Possession: 

Abilities/Weaknesses: Cyclops metabolizes Solar energy directly in his body. This serves two purposes. First, he needs little rest and little other sustenance. Second, he alters those energies into force beams that come out of his eyes whenever they are open. These beams, appearing a ruby red in color, are purely force in nature, emitting no heat, and possessing the force to level a mountain. Naturally, with no help, he cannot control this power. However, using a specially designed visor, Scott has managed to perfect his control of the beams and the controls of the visor to enable him to do incredibly fine things, from carving wood into pictures to pressing buttons, and from pushing people away gently to playing pool. He has an incredible grasp of spatial geometry, an a genius for tactics, which allows him to create patterns in his head and follow them up in real life, such as using one blast of his eyebeams to sink an entire pool table of balls, or to knock down up to eight opponents.

Scott's lack of control has led to him being very paranoid about the chance of having his visor or his sunglasses knocked off, so he had practiced the tactics of closing his eyes if his glasses of visor even shifts, so that he can shut his eyes in less than a second. He can still be caught off-guard however, for he is still human.

His genius at tactical matters and management leads him to create plans which in battle or organization allow him to utilize the abilities of all those around him efficiently and often surprisingly. Scott's fondness of bank shots shows in his tactics, as he will often set in motion an action seemingly having no effect on the battlefield but suddenly leading to a turning of the tide from a surprising direction.

His focus on control, both of his powers,and of himself to never let loose those powers on innocents or loved ones has led to him being somewhat withdrawn and seemingly boody, which leads to others seeing him as unapproachable, a stick in the mud, and arrogant. This has caused numerous problems for him in the past.

Scott is also a pilot of fixed wing airplanes and starships, as well as good at several martial arts, and skilled in teaching both skills to others.

Psychology/Personality: 

Scott has spent his entire lifetime learning control beyond anything anyone else around him knows. He practices control in everything he does, because to do otherwise, to let go even in one area, is to court disaster. He wields focused force blasts, the likes of which could level a medium sized mountain.

He holds the line in himself, because on a day to day basis, he is responsible for the fate of his race, and for the team defending them, and the students who are learning how to be part of those teams, and how to just be human. He has a wicked sense of humor, which rarely is shown. It hides inside him, like most of his other emotions, never showing, never letting others see. But it is there. Inside him brews a storm of passion and love, hate and anguish, guilt and sorrow. He lives and dies for his people, his students, and his team. He is smart, and warm to those he trusts, though he rarely shows it except in private.

He was possessed, effectively killed, in fact, by Apocalypse, and he has come back from that, with his son's and wife's assistance, to find that he wants more passion, more life... and has no idea how to get them.

Scott Summers is one of the least understood men out there. Everyone thinks they know who he is and why he does things, but if you look at the very beginning of his life, as a character, the secrets to who he is are laid out. Scott is the left behind man, the man who again and again was left behind, forced to watch while someone he loved died or vanished from his life. This has led to him having an absolute control of himself and an absolute dedication to his cause and his people. If you are a loved one, a family member of his, then he will stand by you and he will come to you when you are in need, come hell or high water, or death itself.

He is control embodied, a man forced to control his every emotion and thought for at his beck and call is the power to level cities and destroy lives with a moment's carelessness. Scott is the kind of man who will walk through hell to get his people back, who will hold someone when they are hurt, and will stand over them when they are sick. He does not demonstrate his emotions in public very often, but that is because they are important and dangerous, and because he sees, in those around him, how emotions can twist, and make you seem less than you are.

Something he has not thought of in years is the fact that he can turn off his powers completely, if he wishes, but the effort of will is painful, and shifting them back on is not something he could easily do. But since the decision was made by his mind as a child, it lurks within him...

History: Scott Summers was born as the first of two sons to Major Christopher Summers, a test pilot for the U.S. Air Force, and his wife Katherine. When the plane Christopher was flying on a family trip was attacked by strange lights(a Shi'Ar ship), Scott's mother, Katherine pushed him and his brother Alex  out of the plane with the only available parachute, which partially failed on the way down, leaving Scott with a head injury as a result, and forever robbing him of true control of his powers. The plane exploded as they fell and the two believed their parents dead. Alex was placed in foster care and adopted quickly, while Scott languished in a coma for a year, and when he woke up, he was relegated to an orphanage, one that was secretly run by Mister Sinister.

Scott came into foster care eventually, and ended up in the possession of Jack Winters, a mutant criminal who was sometimes known as Jack O'Diamonds. When Scott started having migraine headaches, Jack unwillingly sent him to a specialist who discovered that corrective lenses made of a synthetic ruby quartz made him pain free. Soon after, Scott's mutant power came alive as an uncontrollable blast of optic force from his eyes. 

The blast demolished a crane, endangering a crowd. Though Scott saved them with his powers, they sought to kill him, and he fled. Winters then attempted to use Scott's powers for crimes, physically abusing Scott to enforce his will. Eventually Charles Xavier and F.B.I. agent Fred Duncan teamed up to save Scottand became the first member of the X-Men, a team of young mutants who trained to use their powers in the fight for human/mutant equality. As Cyclops, Scott became the deputy field leader of the X-Men. 

He had many adventures over the years, falling in love not once, but several times, and having a child, and even leaving the team. But he always returned for his skills and powers were suited to little else.

Not long after returning to the team the most recent time, Scott found himself embroiled in Apocalypse's insane plan for ""The Twelve"". In an effort to save his teammates, a powerless Scott threw himself into the fray, and merged with the would-be conqueror to create a new evil entity. Jean detected Scott's psyche inside Apocalypse and prevented the X-Men from destroying him, however he was presumed dead by most of his teammates. Only Jean and Cable refused to believe Scott had perished.

Eventually, He was recovered by them, and returned to the fold, changed...

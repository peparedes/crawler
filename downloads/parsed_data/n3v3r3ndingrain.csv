"event","what a fucking hypocrite!!!!
he says i need to get in shape, that he's worried about my health cuz ""all you do is sit around all day! you're 19! you should be more energetic!!""
what the fuck!!??
19 year olds are NOT energetic, unless u are a cheerleader
but even then
all the 19 year olds i know sleep till noon
how is that energetic??
he says ""we will both do it together!""
yea fucking right!
today, i rode the bike for 25 min and worked out on the bowflex
there
i worked out!
but what i did isn't good enough for him!
he says i need to diet
well, actually what he said was ""you are dieting with me and your mother""
yes
he is forcing me to not eat
and to exercise more then i do already
i'm sorry if 35 min of working out is not good enough
oh!
AND i do yoga!
i did more exercise today then he's done all summer
bastard!
i really do hate him most of the time
there are very very few times when he can be a decent person"

i won't be seing scott everyday
shit i'm going to miss him
more then anything
he's my life

i'm working on a sculpture project
only not really
it's a bunch of ready mades that i have to paint
i really don't consider ready mades sculptures
for all u non art people a ready made is an object that you don't create...u go out and buy/find it
for example
my project consists of a crushed coke can, a right high-heal shoe, a bottle, and a strainer...there will soon be cooked pasta in it as well
then i have to find a painting that i like and paint it on the objects
fun stuff
all due thursday
i'll have it done
i have a few hours tomorrow, and all day wednesday to finish it

so
scott goes to D&D
and i tell him that when i get bored i'll call him to tell him i'm coming over to hang out with him and his friends
which i do
so i go over
and after about 2 hours of just sitting there i get hungry
i tell scott
it's 12 something am
the guy who is running the game says that he will call a break in the next 30 min
ok
fine
break doesn't happen
12:30
i'm really hungry
""don't worry, we're gonna end early tonight"" says the DM
fine
1am
i'm really really hungry and have had enough
i leave
i take scott's keys and am now in his room
they will prabably end in 30 min, go to konover and get food
do u think scott will get me anything??
no
doesn't matter that he knows i'm hungry as all hell
no
he wont
cuz he doesn't think of anybody but himself
he tells me i'm too selfless, that i put people before myself too much
well HE doesn't do it at all
it's all about him in his mind and he thinks of no one but himself
if i was in his shoes, and he left a game i was playing because he was hungry and tired and I KNEW IT, i would go to konover to get food for myself AND for him
why?
because i love him and i knew he was hungry
but would he do that for me
no
no, he will walk in here around 2, happy as a pig in shit cuz he's eaten
and where will i be? waiting here, in his bed
hungry
pissed
tired
and yet goddess i still love him more then anything
i hope he proves me wrong"

he's down in the family room playing video games
and i'm sorry
as riviting as vidio games are...i can only take so much
and when you've been playing for about...oh...3 hours
it starts to get to you...well...maybe not him
but it gets to me

and the music
don't get me started on video game music


so i'm up in his room
on my laptop
cuz there's nothing else for me to do
damn it
i wanna do something

i'd even go to the mall if it ment getting out of this house

Murdock is a bubble-eye gold fish, which means he's got these two sacks of air under his eyes...it looks like he sneezed and the air tried to come out of his eyes and got stuck there. his tail is all beat up as well, it looks like he got into a fight with another fish and the fish tried to eat his tail...u should have seen the other fith though

people are talking...even though nobody really talked
i guess that's the way things work in this group
problems get solved through word of mouth
the same way the problems got started
funny

my stomach is yelling at me big time
i don't know what i ate to make it so unhappy
but it's screaming with all it's organ might
i can feel vibrations in my lungs and intestines
that's how mad it is

i'm tempted to play age of mythology and kick the ass off of the greeks with my mighty egyptian/sometimes norse army

i just finished watching Garden State
i wanna be like sam
not the lying part, even though that made me like her more
but the part of her that just doens't care what anybody thinks and does and says whatever comes to her mind

my secret agent lover man is MIA
he's with tom at the mall

"event","The last two hours have been remarkable at work.  I received two calls before lunch, one advising of a favorable settlement of a difficult case, and the other providing a powerful favorable report from my exceptionally well-qualified expert.  This will likely make settlement of yet another difficult case probable.  I came back from lunch and found an order from a judge in Franklin County doing something that no judge has done in any of my cases in 25 years of practice---refusing the County's request for a delay of the trial in two weeks because the County wants to change experts.  This is a considerable victory for me and my client.  I guess good things do sometimes happen in threes!  

It is interesting how a few triumphs in the arena can offset and banish the negativity of the day-to-day grind and office bullshit."

"event","I had an interesting conversation with my wife this morning.  It has rained for the past 30 hours, and everything is soaked, but it just stopped an hour ago.  She suggested that we go out and rake leaves out of the flower beds today, since the municipality will pickup on Thursday.  I suggested that maybe the yard work could wait until the weather was better, since wet leaves are hard to gather and the inside of the house needs lots of attention.

I suggested that we needed to shop for groceries and food today, since we have no time during the week.  She suggested we simply forage in the fridge.  I noted that we tend to eat out during the week too often when we don't shop on the weekend.  I also noted that I offered to make omelets for dinner all week long, but no one wanted them.  She said we didn't use the food, particularly the tortilla wraps, from last week.  I noted that I had in fact used the tortilla wraps for lunch rollers, including some leftover grilled moose (it's a long story)from Monday night.  She said: ""Oh yea...your moose really confused things for a few days.""  I have no idea what she meant, and was too ""confused"" to ask.  BTW, the moose backstrap tastes and eats just like London Broil, except perhaps a bit more tender.  I will admit, it is a bit exotic, but I usually do not prepare meals quite that unconvential (OK...it came from a hunter client who had a freezer full of stuff and gave it to me to clear out space).  However, the family rarely wants what I offer to make, which is usually good, healthy food.  

I have no idea what our plans are for this afternoon, except that we are having leftover pizza for lunch."

"event","Sometimes I wonder if I have already given up on the marriage.  Do I act in a way that even permits things to improve?  I have certainly tried long and hard in the past.  Treating her with respect and affection yields only limited results, and for a limited time.  Should it be this hard?  I think not.  I am fulfilling my obligation to my kids.  Can I do more?  Do I want to do more, or do I really want a way out?"

"event","The Al Jarreau concert is tonight, and I am really looking forward to it, as I always do to live music by talented artists.  My wife has, at last, decided that she will accompany me, despite her fear of being mugged outside the theater.  She had previously declined to attend.  Although company is welcome, her presence is usually a distraction from the music.  She does not experience music as I do, and her lack of any emotional response is...distracting.  Beyond that, she will complain about everything from the woman's perfume two rows behind to the temperature in the theater.  Sometimes I wish I could just experience the music alone, and ultimately I tune her out and do just that.  It's just annoying up to that point...and sad.  ...but the show will be a real high for me!  Yea!"

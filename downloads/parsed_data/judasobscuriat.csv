"event","I've read a lot of reviews on this movie, in fact spent far too much time figuring out whether or not to go see the thing, whether or not the kids would enjoy, etc. etc.  I've realized that no movie is worth such trials, it's true, and yet here I am writing a review because I feel compelled to do so.

I've read a number of reviews by long-time fans (I'd put that in quotes but I don't want to be TOO offensive) who truly expect that the modern Turtle will hearken back faithfully to the days of monochromatic yore, where the bandanas only changed color with contrast, where the blood was dark (and there was much of it), and where the stories ran darker still.  They are, sadly, fools to expect such things.

It is safe to say that the Fox Cartoon of the early 90's came close to thoroughly dispelling the Turtles' ability to remain suspense novel entertainment (I'd use the term Adult Themed but that has other overtones too heavy to number and name); and, while not entirely successful at doing so, the parental versions of highly offended individuals who must shelter all children from such atrocities as the live action movie (the closest we'll likely ever get to the comic for the time being) certainly were.  And the 2 movies that followed were entirely forgettable because of that, Vanilla Ice notwithstanding.

However, that being said, the animated movie that we see today is much closer to the comic than the fans will allow you to think.  It's true that it ISN'T as high paced as one might expect and neither is the dialog as flashy or as intense as it once was (though if you read back it was never of the English Lit level we would all like you to believe it was to begin with), and I will be the millionth guy to also tell you that, should a TMNT movie be done R rated and Sin City style, I'd be the first dude on the block lined up with a credit card flashing to see it.

On the other hand, for a cast of characters taken from B-Movie suspense plots filled with action and intrigue to an A-List group of kids product lines, I believe the movie succeeds on many levels.  I love the family dynamic and feel, honestly, that this is one movie that required a bit more time to flesh itself out.  If anything, I was far more interested in what was happening at home for the Turtles and not what was happening on the surface.  I think it successfully begins bridging the gap between kids entertainment and adulty fantasy fiction.  I think that, if they're given the second chance, you'll likely see the fleshing out they deserve.
The story's been done many times over, as have most animated movies, it's true, but it feels fresh enough to work and, further, I think it's one of those tentative efforts that begs the far, far better sequel, the one that satisfies all but the worst of the fanboys and girls.  At that point, those folks are being snobs for the sake of being snobs.

The animation is truly TOP line, with exquisite detail and lighting, the colors are appropriately grim and there are enough ""nicely done gents"" tip-of-the-hat moments that make one applaud the work of boys and girls of Imagi Studios.  It is worth going for the animation alone, especially if you happen to be of the sort who sat with jaws unhinged throughout The Incredibles or perhaps even Ghost In The Shell.  

But like I said. For me the family dynamic shows that, underneath the hype there's some hope for the franchise, adding that dimension of realism and humanity that keeps it from being the 1.75 hour long commercial it so easily could've been.

Not that it wasn't, mind you, of course it was... but it was pretty well done all the same.  

Also, it should absolutely be noted that my kids (son, 9, and daughter, 6) enjoyed it immensely and neither of them are easily amused.  That, in and of itself, is a feat that deserves attention!

So one vote for the Turtles.  Here's hoping they get their chance at the sequel.  I think it'll be worth the wait.

For now, go see TMNT and suspend your need for intellectual sustenance.  Candy bars can be good for you, too.

"event","Marc McGwire was known to many people as a gentleman on and off the field.  His home-run capabilities awed his peers and dazzled his fans.  His nationally sponsored child abuse program is one of the few foundations funded by a sports figure that is truly worth the money spent; and, while a very private man, he is well known to be kind and friendly to any young fan who recognizes him and stops to chat.  He was humble enough to know when he was no longer able to play at the level they were paying him to play... and that says a lot about someone's character.

We are a nation who pay billions of dollars to watch gangsters in their own branded hightops beat the hell out of each other on and off a basketball court, occasionally beating a drug rap or rape case or two. 

We call these men heroes.

We still vote players into the Pro Bowl with four game suspensions due to drug allegations.  We have seen up to five members of an NFL team indicted on harassment and possession charges.  We continue to honor them by paying them more money year by year.  Several of these men are in the Hall.

Mark McGwire was never charged with the possession of nor use of steroids by anybody other than Jose Canseco (a man worthy of, shall we say, a raised eyebrow at the most).  Neither was their use banned while he was a player, a legal point but a valid one all the same.

I take issue with people who judge by association, that take action without evidence.  This is what happened to Mark McGwire.  He is, by every standard, a Hall of Famer, and will always be one to me and my son.

If it were not for the great Home Run Race of 1998, baseball would have remained in the can.  Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire single-handedly brought the public's attention back to America's Pasttime.  This is what should be considered.  McGwire's class with the Maris family should be considered.  The fact that he never forgot his son, even in his largest, brightest spotlight.  These things should be considered.

McGwire was a hero.  A sports hero, to be true, not necessarily the everyday type (except, perhaps, to his son), but a hero nonetheless.

The fact that he chose to keep his comments to himself is his God given right as well as his legal right.  He was not on the stand as the accused, but as a media witness.  It was not his place to be and the fervor that it has unraveled is wholly unnecessary.

Babe Ruth was a drunk, a womanizer.  Ty Cobb one of the most viciously ruthless people in history, and a racist.  These people are in the Hall glorified for their achievements on the diamond, not for who they were in life.  If that were so, perhaps they would in fact NOT be on such pedestals as they are now.  It's terribly easy to tear down human gods.

Hitting a home run is one of the single most difficult things to do in sports.  The timing, the form, the speed, the contact; all things must come together, the angels must sing for a baseball to ride the lightning.
Mark McGwire did it with ease and at an at-bat-rate that has yet to be matched.  Ladies and Gentleman, that's dominant skill and it was a skill that saved Baseball's face.

Where is McGwire now that baseball needs saving again?  At home, usually with his son, living life as any dad should: on his own terms.

It is not for us to judge that.

Vote him in.  Stop playing the hypocrite.

or

Change it all.  Sports-wide. 

You'll be amazed at the money we'll all save when we find that we don't have enough ""clean"" heroes left to play a game of baseball, or basketball, hustle on the gridiron.

Where will those millions go? I wonder.


p.s. also, it should be noted that it appears to be QUITE acceptable to have a president who has been arrested for drunk driving and is an admitted ex-cocaine addict.  And this man is considered a CONSERVATIVE."

"event","Well hi there.  

The messy thing about in-company interviews is thus:  They have these interesting and totally misappropriated notions about who you are and the job you may do, even though they've not worked a full day alongside you in their lives.  And then there's this issue of dating someone in the workforce, which apparently is fine if she is slightly above you but it is not fine if you are her manager, never mind the track record of maintaining spotless professionalism and an <i><b>improved</i></b> productivity in the workforce since the relationship began.  No, their interest is in the legality of the whole thing.  I understand the ethics but this is the same company that never promotes females, even if they are the only ones qualified for the position; and if they DO in fact promote a woman, said woman is under major scrutiny until she either steps down, quits, or finally gets fired by the machismo majority.  Ethics my fanny.

I do NOT feel the need to justify to anyone, at ANY TIME, the reasons nor the emotive behind who I date, when I date, and neither should the person I am dating.  None of your beeswax, my brother would say.  ""Apparently you're dating so and so."" Yeah, well, apparently these are my middle fingers.  Can we get to business?  Such as the fact that we're here to interview for a new position?  That I am more than qualified to fill?  Or are you going to sacrifice that opportunity because you are uncomfortable with a situation that everyone else is totally sleeping soundly with?  

I see that choosing the latter is far easier.  Good day.  Thank you for wasting two hours of my time.  And the piece of my mind that I was going to give you but had to swallow, in the name of professionalism yet again.  The poetry that was wasted, I tell you, was worth for more than the salary you two ate up while grilling me about my personal life and it's possible consequences in the workforce.

And I even wore a TIE.  Which, for those of you that don't know me, is a small to medium sized miracle in and of itself.  Look at me.  I look DEAD SEXY and they have the audacity to waste these looks on their petty grievances.  I might as well have worn a tank top that said ""Flatulence IS a Sport,"" cut-offs, and my flip-flops.  As well as perhaps my best mullet do.

Then I would have felt appropriate, and hence properly appreciated for the things that I bring to the table.  Namely Bud Light.

Bastards.

Outside of that I suppose today was okay, huh?  I received not one but TWO lucky bamboo from Yellow, who deserves kudos for even talking to me at all, let alone sending me legal greens.  Thank you, thank you.  It was felt and appreciated from tip to toe.  I have always wanted one... now I have the both and I love them.

And let us not forget miss CAH who has been most supportive through all this mess, despite the fact that none of the guys in the workforce flirt with her anymore due to her new ""owned"" status.  Which is, of course, mildly hysterical but I never laugh about it out loud.  Almost never.  All hail the pretty lady and her browns that like to be admired.  Hail Hail, as PJ always used to say.  Huzzah.

And for E and L:  This tempest is merely a swirling of steam.  Don't make it out to be more than it may be, else it COULD go cyclone.  Tell those who need to be told.  If the two of you are happy: so be it.  Of others cannot be accepting of that, I realize it's tough, but that would be their problem.  Try hard not to make it yours. People love ya and are often driven to their conclusions by their own fears and failures, as I believe this case to be.  It will round out in the end.  You're meant to be.  It's allllllll in the pike.  And the mountains await.  :)

Ladies and Gentleman, I'm all of 29.  As of this COMING November 24th.  Thanksgiving.  And already my kids, specifically my youngest, are calling me ""Pops.""

Revel in this while ye may, folks.  It won't last long.  I can, however, wholeheartedly suggest that you all buy stock in duct tape.  Soon.  Because for some reason, it's going to become a high demand product.  

I can't imagine why.

ON THE LIGHTER SIDE OF THINGS:

The trip is booked. The girl and I are off to Cabo San Lucas as of January 20th and we'll be blissfully unaware of anything but the sound of surf and the palapa beach bartender through the 25th.  Ahhhhh the aural mantra of sur and the Sea of Cortez.  We're not coming back.  

Until then, retail has its claws dip within my neural expose' as I become the one who supplies Santa and his sleigh.

Oooooh rhyming poetry.  Be still my heart.

No kidding though, I really DID sell camera gear to Santa.  It said so on his business card.  And he bought lots of stuff, so I figure he's doing alright.  Non-profit my ass.  Running a racially pure workforce above and beyond the UN sanctions concerning human rights appears to be QUITE profitable.  Can you say Elven Apartheid children?  Sure, I knew you could.  Santa wishes to partake of the business aspect of having his picture taken with all those little girls and boys.  Was I disconcerted by this?  Appalled?  Nah.  Welcome to the 21st century.

I'm going to write, yeah WRITE, as in SCRIBE, words to PAPER (a post-wood pulp product), my grandma for the first time in years.  Don't know why but she deserves a letter from her wayward grandson.

Okay.  that's it for now.  Talk soon."

"event","An unfinished poem that wishes terminal velocity if you please:

Tires pavement percussive
Once a wind and an undercarriage
Now an army on the march
and there a drawn courtship cart on a cracked and shelled country road
All noises outside an accelerated vehicle's window at 2am

Crickets go silent: no ollie oxen free, no hidden mean
no homebase to touch in haste and giddiness at the end of a summer's day 
hazed, chiggered, lightning bugged and rising moons
all stalked wheat bowing in unison to save their honor 
all oak and sycamore weaving within the arboreal cicada chorale 
Catalytic twilight rhythms and the remnants of footsteps on the lawn
I lit a fire called desire and bottled the lightning with the rest

Camouflage and invisibility, so hard to be seen and yet not seen
Antigrav boots disturb not a blade and shao-lin no sound
Where will we be meet in the rye again but on the corner of a 24 hour diner
The land having been recorded in vinyl vibration, 
whirling in infinity through my windshield
All the sighing sounds, hum and bark, cries and harpsichordal tendencies settle in the hair; 
flowerettes and pieces of past a thrum and tickertape disaster, a littering of years, teletyped texts of tomorrow.

Reaching out and beginning the process of picking clean the catgut strands and licking wounds, settle a moment and allow the hands their work, continue about your sermon, your processes and let love observe in proximity.  Let the epicenter base connect with tectonic movement, shattering records and every window on this side of the street.

Imagine what the word silver sounds like, if pushed to describe itself, and if given a persona.

Playing hide and seek with an earthquake was never a game to win... it was always flirtation and a dare to kiss the grounds upon which we walk 'fore the cracks could swallow whole.  


I don't know.  It's good, right.  but not done.  though it COULD be done.  I don't know.

Strange days indeed mister Lennon.  Strange days.  Good thing the Flaming Lips agreed and did you justice.

As it is....

Many many many smiles and hugs and thrown pies to miss L and mister E and their engagement.  As in: to be wed.  As in: holy SHIT.

:D

So cool.  And that's my technical description.

I'll have more to say when the meds wear off.  Pray for my kids at school.  They labor underneath an education budget provided by your local Republican Proletariat.

oh.  I suppose all insinuation aside, you've already taken it to that level.  Well kudos to the lot of you then.  And points to the morning and afternoon, yo.

As it IS, let me be the first on this page to lay down congrats and kudos and well wishes and hugs and dark chocolate nubbins to master Eric and his Lady Lind...  they appear to be QUITE happy and lovey and all those good things that come with people who honestly DO DIG one another and are willing to step out of the car to tell the world about it, albeit in that quiet subtle manner that comes with a look and a grin or perhaps a quick smooch.  Eric got SMOOCHED!!!! Hail HAIL!  I say let the ticker tape fall, let the streamers wind, let the kazoo cacophony commence!

You go you two.

Also, since we're all mushy and sentimental right now, let it be said that I, too, have the woman of the world and that I am most thankful for it.  You rock oh she of the brown eyes and admiration.  Let adulation pour forth.  But not too frothy.  Though she looks unfathomably cute in her new floppy Broncos hat.  It is strange being on the other end of a sports fanatic relationship, having a girlfriend who is addicted to football and all, but I don't see what the big deal is with people who cannot stand them.  I think it's fabulous, really.  Someone who can really enjoy ANYthing is someone to hang with.  Those folks who can't stand it have no sense of humor and are probably not exactly looked upon as dateworthy or hangoutable.  Two words hereby christened and put forth to the world.

Also a shout out to Chi-town, to the lady illin' in illinois, who appears to be having better days after having all her winter clothing held hostage by a loon and his mother.  Privacy being the given reason. ???!!!  I can only conclude that said loon wants to privately wear her winter clothing.  I declare that, while miss Chicago is a paragon of fashionable taste and sensual mantra, I'm not entirely sure her wardrobe is fit for even the most discerning of transvestite guitar players.  She's so darned thin.  If she didn't walk like a cat you'd swear she was fragile.  She talks a great deal of smack, however, so beware.  Cowtown gone city girl.  Tough stuff.  ooh.  scary. {poker faced irony}

okay there is the outpouring of the day.  That and lo, there be folded clothing in the kids drawers for the first time in, like, ever, and that they assisted in said folding.  Miracles and wonders abound here in Littleton, CO.  Buy the next lotto or Powerball ticket you can get your hands on folks because you just can't beat odds like that.

I swear.

even kitty appears to be in a good mood. will wonders never cease.

You want scary?  How about the words DEBT CONSOLIDATION.  Man.  Went through it.  Far far far too easy to get those guys to just hand me off money like it's nothing (and, really, to them, what they gave me, it's nothing, tho to me it's everything and then some).

Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit...

Grade:  A-

Yes it was the claytastic cinema goodness we thought it would be.  Why the minus?  Honestly because the pacing was a bit much for the kidlets in the audience.  Once things got under way, however, the magic and humor and genius of it all took over and even I was laughing like a loon whenver possible.  It really is a great movie for everyone, and I usually hate attempting to say things like that.  So go see it.  You maroons.  Why are you still sitting there?  It was far better than Tim Burton's Corpse Bride... which, truthfully, was a tad boring.  I mean, of course it was artistically well executed, it's Tim Burton for crying out loud, but this one seemed tired and overdrawn and SHORT.  I mean holy crow short.

See I had originally written a review piece accompanied by more of my usual worthless ranting the other day when the power was blown out due to the inordinate amount of ICE dumping from the sky.   Denver lost weight when all was said and done though.  You'd've thought a foliage diet had been ordered up and served cold.  We have this beautiful birch tree out in the middle of the greenbelt here between apartment rows and she looked like her skirts had been dropped.  Poor thing.  She'll make it though.  She always has.

ANYwho.  I'm apparently too distracted to create coherent and flowing thought patterns.  Time to make dinner.

<!--End ColorQuiz.com code-->

and so you may or may not link to it, here are the results in and of themselves.  No sarcasm whatsoever and in all seriousness: this thing nailed me.   Like a recoiless hammer and a serial killer.


<b>Judas's Existing Situation</b>
Needs, and insists on having, a close and understanding relationship, or at least some method of satisfying a compulsion to feel identified.


<b>Judas's Stress Sources</b>
The tenacity and strength of will necessary to contend with existing difficulties has become weakened. Feels overtaxed, worn out, and getting nowhere, but continues to stand his ground. He feels this adverse situation as an actual tangible pressure which is intolerable to him and from which he wants to escape, but he feels unable to make the necessary decision.


<b>Judas's Restrained Characteristics</b>
Willing to become emotionally involved and able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity.

Trying to calm down and unwind after a period of over-agitation which has left him listless and devoid of energy. In need of peace and quiet; becomes irritable if this is denied him.



<b>Judas's Desired Objective</b>
Hopes that ties of affection and good-fellowship will bring release and contentment. His own need for approval makes him ready to be of help to others and in exchange he wants warmth and understanding. Open to new ideas and possibilities which he hopes will prove fruitful and interesting.


<b>Judas's Actual Problem</b>
The tensions induced by trying to cope with conditions which are really beyond his capabilities, or reserves of strength, have led to considerable anxiety and a sense of personal (but unadmitted) inadequacy. He reacts by seeking outside confirmation of his ability and value in order to bolster his self-esteem. Inclined to blame others so that he may shift the blame from himself. Anxiously searching for solutions and prone to compulsive inhibitions and compulsive desires.


it's twoo. as my dad always said.  always seeking rarely finding.  like an aqua-archaeologist.  man it's rough lol.

oh.  taking the kids and the lovely girl to see Wallace and Gromit tonight.  Prepare for cinematic kick-ass-ed-ness.

oh yes.

see ya.

"event","you know what's interesting is that it's been so long since I've spent more than a few minutes online a day, that my typing has suffered severely.  Once I could fly along the keys like a fingertip ballet, feathering strokes accurately and proficiently with all the grace of a spring swan in show.  Lately I feel a little more like a thumbing jackhammer in slower motion, only with marginally less finesse and aptitude.  How strange it is.  Molasses on a rainy day, right?  Slow, sweet, inconvenient?

I think I'm off in some sort of strange limbo land.  An odd form of mental purgatory as I enact some changes or so around me.  It's like a whirlwind with an eye in the center, one where little happens, where sounds are often damped and muted, and where the storm surrounding lets little of the outside world in for recognition or ascertainment.  Like a misted window on a cold winter morning minus the intricacies of frost... just vague colors and ghosted information to decipher.  

It's interesting and poetic but a tad losing on the trail you know?

So the whining musings first, since I haven't been here for, say, at least a presidential administration.

yeah so the ex-girlfriend of several months ago has decided that it is now and finally her idea to separate and commands silence, non-recognition, incommunicado, from both sides.  this is fine with me.  I won't bother anyone with the backstory because it's fairly well cliche for a new millennium relationship, especially for one that started online.  Exceptions: we really were who we said we were (don't want to hear anyone's contradictions on their own behalf.  let's face it: most online relationships begin with a lie.), and we really were serious about wanting to be somewhere.  turns out it was just not somewhere that necessarily involved one another.  Fair enough.  I like peanut butter and bananas but they're never going on a piece of bread congruently, right?  Fine.  It's a future that works for some (though often, not without honey), just not for me.

the job:  let's also face this inarguable truth: retail IS purgatory and WILL eventually either prove your salvation (even your possible martyrdom, I don't care if you're catholic or not) or it will prove your utter, eternal, and cosmic demise, having sucked your soul of all vitality, veracity, and humane saturation.  Fine. Who wants a pastel soul anyway?  Pastels tend to bother me as it is: half-assed colors.  Colors that don't care enough to actually show  when called upon.  Lazy saturation.  Ask me about mauve and I'll show you a goddam maroon that knows what's what.

Yeah so the boss is a lonely guy who really should stop trying to hook up with his subordinate female employees.  we have ""new girl"" who looks like denise richards at 18, with a dash of modern day east india tea HIPPiE added to the mix (don't ask me for the history of the east india tea company, I don't want to go into that right now).  She's old enough and experienced enough with body to know that she can flutter here, pout there, quote Henry Miller here, Vonnegut there, drink her chai and wear her low cut lace blouses, and bossman will do as she says.  problem is she's not old enough to know that this works on lonely older men to the point of possible feelings and may induce them to send emails to her saying as such, so that said e-sweet-nothings may be intercepted by her power-hungry fiancee who may then also be forced to take action involving our corporate HR department.

said boss has abruptly been on leave for what has now been quoted to be a time period of a ""week or more.""  whatever that means.  let's not forget that this author's friend lisa, who applied only recently to our humble camera shop, has called and stated that she has been offered management in the ""denver market.""  Ladies and gentlemen, in my company, my store IS the ""denver market.""  We have but three stores.  And only one of them is in ""the denver market.""  hmmmmmmmmmmm...

yeah so other than that: life isn't so bad.  gotta get okayed by the overlords at HOA (we won't go into the possible acronyms that we could make from those three letters, though you all are by all means condoned, urged and otherwise pleaded with to do so) to get all four windows replaced before the winter snows finally arrive (and they are coming, fall is moving pretty fast in his new sneakers these days).  Also must look into debt consolidation so that I can save myself from the destructive post-divorce financial aftermath that is attempting to occur.

yeeha.

heavy.

I shall go over the ""new"" girlfriend aspects of life in due time.  It suffices to say, however, that things there are fabulous and that she is more than lovely and that there is a distinct possibility that she is way out of my league, though please don't tell her so.  I have to keep her believing that I am cool enough to stick with.

also it is yet another random act of beauty, this colorado fall.  it is early to mid autumn that causes this state to rule more than any other.  that and our continual proximity to the stars.  You city folk rarely get a chance to dwell on astronomy as your stars are hidden en masse behind an oxygen rich atmosphere and light pollution, leaving your constellations to be crude dot-to-dots, with rarely more than a numeric order past 15 or so, though it may span the sky to complete the image.  

it is worth the lack of oxygen to feel closer to something, visually, even if it is really no more than a micron on the scale of things.

love to all,

"event","And that question is:

<font size=5>WHAT THE FUCK?!</font>

I mean, okay, so, the lot of you know (what, all 27 crickets out there chirping gaily in the audience.  I love the ambience, please keep it up.  And if could do Chopin's Nocturn 87 in C-minor, that would be fantastic) that I'm just not a blog guy.  I write and I write, true, but elsewhere.  But this has been a sincerely blog worthy day.  

Let's start... oh say HERE.

1.) Good friends K and D have been married all of 3 months.  Tops.  D was fired this morning and didn't tell K about it until 5pm.  They've got enough of the first year blues going on.  This sort of scaredy kat second thought whoashitshesgonnakillme hesitation has no place here.  Also some people need to turn off their video games so their libido can recharge so their wife can be happy.  Simple.  geez.

2.) 3 hour phone conversation with the ex-girlfriend.  Was civil, lighthearted, friendly, even caring and yet... painful.  Why they have to happen in the manner they do is beyond me.  She made an excellent point in a metaphor about escaping from a spider's web once broken up.  It's true. And it's arduous, tedious stuff.  Why can we not just be ourselves?

3.) Co-Worker, whom I've had a bit of a taste for, if you'll pardon the expression, has since told me that she has a similar hidden crush for me but that she's been secretly dating ANOTHER co-worker for some time now.  If I'd had 5 jaws, they'd all be on the floor in utter shock.

4.) Current lust/affair/situation:  another K whom I've known for a long time has found her way under my skin and into my hormonal stream and now, come nights, there is often little else I can think of.  How do they do it?  Little barbs? Syringes?  How do they inject themselves into me like this?  I have a secret and invisible tattoo that is apparently visible under certain light wavelengths, it says ""SUCKER"" in large and rather well defined custom letters.

5.) I wait in gallery purgatory for a review of my profile and photography to see if I qualify to sell or show there.  Ah well.  I need to finally buckle down and sell some work... and justify all these hours in front of a computer {whistles innocently}.

6.) I've had nearly an entire bottle of cherry wine... and I'm a tad woozy for sure.  Perhaps I'll leave this for another time.  But damn, what a day.  And we don't even get the honor of a reprieve.

Toad had no idea they were asking for.

"event","Ever spent the entire morning emailing and making phone calls, all these connections, linguistics, words, blah blah, ha that's funny ha, and then you're done.... and suddenly realizing that, through all of that, not one thing of actual substance was accomplished?

yeah. me too. funny. go figure.

these blogs will take some time getting used to.  Especially whilst typing with no glasses.  Understand, now, that I've made the claim that I actually type better with out them.

It's a total crock of course, but it was a good thing to say at the time.

as it is errands, errands, errands.  Soon something of depth and structural disorder shall arise and people may find it worth their time to come in and state ops and disregards.

until then.

ciao."

"event","<font size=4><b>On the Eve of a Scarlet Leaving</font></b>


<i>A study in red
lifted from pages collected, dusted and settled;
A picture of isolation
in the mind, sewn petals blown and sifted sky:
The floating daisies,
tears in a whirlwind summer fight, black, white and gifted,
leave to the far left of the color spectrum
in shimmering infra-rose an ultra-carmine never suspected-
a little girl amidst a vision.

thermal pockets and inverted night
the sighing sound of scribbled chalk on a sidewalk
leaving heiroglyphs for the elders to decipher...
it's a long trot home this scarlet eve-
cosmic debris and incantations on the rise-
Songs worry the wheatgrass like footsteps
And saturated eyes.
No skyscraping lies tonight
Just two arms to embrace
Two lips to save face
And a screen door between here and infinity

Listen: the sidewalk pounds into the distance
A study of red
The picture in isolation
The future of all running feet beside her art...
The rain may fall, obliterate her heart,
And bleed colors into the blades that shake and tremble before its mighty beat, thundering away at the stars.

A screen door shuts with a snap
Closing fingers on eternity
Amplifying the roar of an implosion in this urban canyon

Strange what a mess liberation can be
That chaos may encompass freedom
And how no one has time to tidy up in the sudden and blinding hurricane of sunlight and open air,
Finding it fair, this study in red, and propping the storm door open...

All inviting the world in for a light and honeyed afternoon tea.</i>"

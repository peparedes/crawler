Sun burnt. Like really extremely cooked.BBQ-ed. Ow my lower arms.
Pass me the ketchup!! BUT it was all worth it... CAUSE
the photoshoot was totally awesome!!!!

though there were some hilarious moments. Like for instant when me n Ella
walk on the suspended bridge. Holycow, we didn't know that the gap was THAT
wide. Even walking on the side of the steel walkway was scary as hell. It creaks in certain
places, the barricades were lose. I mean OMFG. We were literally quaking in the knees.
Every concrete slab (there were two) was met with cheers!! The wind was also being an ass
as well. although it scares the shit outta we we still went back to take some 'stun' poses.
we felt so brave!!! funny thing though we felt comfortable after taking a few pics.

anways i got seriously alot of pictures to edit.. so yeah be prepared to see a whole lot.

<lj-cut text=""and we begin with 3 shots"">oh yeah this is our very own le_purestatic posing infront of us. and yeah with me behind it......... oh yeah ella goes by the name of Elouis Opalchensik.. *shakes head*

"event","<div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><br />im in a dilemma between preferring&nbsp; to play poorly but getting the point versus playing extremely well but getting no where?<br />the truth is taking the whole freaking nature of the game a draw is still better than losing all 3 points. especially against teams<br />like Stokes - defending resolutely - kudos to them on that. but i'm not blind .. fact remains we should have won comfortably. <br />but a point is still a point. i rather have a point rather than nothing. the season is longer still.<br /><br />i prefer not to talk about the other teams. call me a rose tinted whack job but i'm not goin to worry the Mancs, Le Arse , Cheatski and Citeh's of the world. i'm aware of them but i'm not obsessed by them. cos they are not my team. i'm not even gonna touch on the player though i'll still occasionaly spew a few choice words during the game but they play for my team.&nbsp; <br /><br />best concentrate on our own team. one game at a time.<br /><br />ps: i blame myself for utter inconvinience. i should have done a capspam. </div>"

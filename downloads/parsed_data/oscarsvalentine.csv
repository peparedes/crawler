"event","I press my fuzzy lap into the smooth and bending lines of your lower back.  You moan quietly, stir, both awake and still asleep in those early morning hours before dawn, before the alarm snatches you away from me and dresses in an architect's suit of creased dress pants, sharp brown shoes pointing from the cuffs, and a button down of simple and elegant design.

You sling one arm over your side curling a man's fingers around mine, the way a child might grasp a mother's fingers.

I am wet.

I am wet and warm.  

I don't know if it's my body against yours or the blanket of heat laying flat across the city that makes the line of sweat appear on my brow and above my lip.

I talk to you, whisper in your ear insignificant ramblings of the morning, our start of day, and I feel a rise beneath the sheet.  Your body knows my voice the way that my fingers can trace the creeping, crawling vines of hair around your navel from memory.  

And so I press that warm brown patch more firmly against you, meaningfully, until flesh melts against flesh.  

I'd swear the mercury rose ten degrees in the bedroom of your Irish Channel apartment and in the dirty city streets.  The city knows us both so intimately.

You are awake now.  You roll over on top of me.  And your body keeps moving as deep and sharp as the Mississippi, even as you cough and laugh into my hair.  And I am undone with love and pleasure.

God bless this city."

"event","Maybe we should've made love on the stacks of Rolling Stones you've saved, stacked, stored in plastic crates on the floor, on the shelf above a line of hanging clothes, beneath the bed until the vintage year when they were ripe enough, mature enough, for the curb, for the garbage truck and giveaways.  

I wonder whether the waxy covers would burn cherries on our bare skin, leave long lean cuts like claw-marks of cats in heat or acrylic nails run down a length of back.  Would we sink into the crackling folds of paper, get lost in the margins, lost in airbrushed images of the ""ideal"", or just slide across in one fluid motion?

And could we say then, ""Fuck them?  Fuck what they think of us?""  Would you love every pound of flesh of me?  Would I love your crooked smile, love your awkward fondling of my emotions, my heart, my zipper?
 
The paper would pop and purr like logs in a fire.  And if the glossy pages burnt away beneath our bodies' friction, maybe the only thing left behind would be the way I really feel for you and the way you really feel for me."

Skies weep, like the one outside my window now, from clouds as dark as the circles under my eyelids when I am sad, when I can't sleep, or when I get caught in a rainstorm, like this one here, and my mascara bleeds and rolls in black waves down my cheeks.

And sometimes things, inanimate things, have more compassion than human beings, the way a rock sometimes rolls from underfoot when it sees that you have struck your toe against it."

"event","I hear glass shattering above my head. Above me long and jagged pieces are suspended in the air, rhythmically slapping together like the pieces on a front porch wind chime.   They sound like rain, like a swarm of bees, like everything, and like nothing I've ever heard or seen.  Then they fall to the concrete, a small block cordoned off by yellow caution tape, smashing there into billions of tiny, rainbow colored fragments.  And I can't stop looking at them, lying at my feet, trying to piece together what they were before all this, trying to remember the shape of them polished, whole and new.

A construction worker starts to yell at me from a fifth floor window.  I think that somehow, absorbed in my thoughts, I must have crossed the caution tape and into some sort of street peril.  But no, I realize soon enough, he's calling out, ""Que bonita!"" and whistling.  

I walk on, down through a sea of dark colored faces waiting at the bus stop, crossing the street between two chrome bumpers, the first car parked too far into my pedestrian walkway.  The portable toilets across from the library smell of fresh urine in hellacious humidity - acrid, pungent, and sour.  I'm almost to work, where I will kill another 8 hours, 40 hours a week.  It makes me hope the hours of my life will not be too many.  I know it's a horrible thought, dark and nasty.  But today I can't help it.

My morning email yields a handful of, ""Thanks for applying, the job has been filled"" form letters and I am thrust again (or is ""deeper"" a better word?) into melancholy.  I cannot even get one fucking interview.  I think of applying for a job in Nashville.  My finger is on the trigger, the ""Enter"" button.  But in the end, I can't do it.  Not yet.  Maybe this afternoon, perhaps tomorrow, in an hour or two, someday, at some time, something has to give.

I woke up with the Tracy Chapman tune Cold Feet on repeat in my head.  I don't know what got Brain FM playing.   Was it a dream, a waking thought, a sign of some kind?  Doubtless the sentiment seems rather perfect this a.m.  Why is enough never enough?  Why at the core is there always emptiness?



LYRICS:


There was a little boy once upon a time 
Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind 
For every copper penny and clover he would find 
Make a wish for better days the end of hard times 
For no more cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 

His clothes were always clean 
His face was always scrubbed 
There was food on the table enough to fill him up 
His house was full of life - His house was full of love 
But when winter days arrived 
There was never money enough to shod his cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet"

"event","Dear Jesse,
 
Is it okay if I start off with ""Dear""?  I'm not much of a computer girl.  I like letters dripping in black ink, postmarked and sitting in my mailbox, though I'm bad at writing them, rarely receive them - and quite often lose them beneath the mounds of debris that, in essence, is my apartment furniture.  (Not every Virgo, quite apparently, is clean.)  I guess it is sentimentality, some piece of cheap romantic idealism planted in my head by my parents, who have been married since they were 16 and 17 respectively, and watered by goofy Meg Ryan films that, I assure you, I no longer watch.  Letters just seem, somehow, more intimate.
 
My friend Liza posted this blurb, this ad, the consequences of which of appear to be growing and building up speed, like some mad rolling snowball.  Oh, that's right; we don't have those in New Orleans.  Anyway, she did not ask my permission and I did not give it.  She simply forwarded the responses to my email address with a simple explanation - craigslist, personals.  I can't speak for her actions other than to suggest that it seemed like a good idea after several glasses of Jameson, our very favorite cocktail.  I guess the good thing about a computer ad is that you aren't subjected to her slurred speech as she recounts my finer points.
 
Out of curiosity, if one were to lace someone's Jameson with a liquid laxative, do you think that the person would taste it?  (Damn these thoughts of revenge!)
 
You are indeed outside the specified age range and I was wondering a bit whether I should toss you out like a contestant on one of those damn reality shows that clog up the airwaves like ham does the arteries.  But despite the surge of responses, and believe-you-me, there was a surge, you seem to be the only one capable of typing a complete sentence - and appreciating things that I appreciate, of course.
 
So about me:  I graduated from the University of Georgia with a degree in Journalism.  I'm currently not using the same said degree because, quiet frankly, it's damn hard to make a living as a writer in this city - and I just love NOLA too much to leave.  I'm also not very aggressive or cut-throat like newspaper writers almost have to be by necessity.  I love feature writing, Southern fiction, politics, human interest pieces, humor, and satire of all sorts...   Like you, I'm interested in art-house movies, Indie and foreign films.  I like theatre.  I like dinners out.  I like building costumes for every holiday.  I paint poorly and sketch until my fingers are black with charcoal.  And if you can learn to play ""Sweet Melissa"" on your guitar then I might, quite honestly, marry you - or at least donate an organ, should yours fall into disrepair.  (FYI, I have lived in this city about four years, so if I were you, I wouldn't ask for my liver.)
 
I have attached a photo of myself with a horse I met while touring the Republic of Ireland .  It was a birthday gift to self (the trip, not the horse), my first International trip, only my second time ever out of the South.  Thought it would be a good one to send, since my hair covers that nasty facial scar ... just kidding.
 
So there's my response.  There you have it.  
 
Now the burning question, ""Why are you looking for lovin' online?""
 
With much curiosity,
Melissa"

Dear You,

It's me.  Time apart is doing us good I think - or me, at least.  I mean, I still think about you most everyday, sometimes for a moment, sometimes for two.  But it's easier knowing that you're somewhere out there, far, far away.  Loving you is hard when you are here, right under my nose, always somewhere I can bump into you while you are having cocktails with your cute little friend, the successful one.  It's easier when you are too far away to call and invite me to do things because you know that I can't just say ""no"" to you.  Ah, yes, I miss you.  You're one of my best friends.  For the first week I wasn't so good without you.  But now, well, I'm getting the hang of it, now I think I'm getting the distance I need to not love you.  And someday I won't love you.  And it will be so much nicer, just being friends.  Isn't that an idea!  

...

Actually, could you stay away a little bit longer?  Yes, yes, a few more weeks might do.

...

Love ya,

Mel"

"event","""Stop kissing...me...you asshole.""  

It was hard to tell you that.  Every time I tried to open my mouth to speak, you crammed your tongue inside.  Drunk, idiot, fool, hopped up on Liza's green rum punch, on whiskey and Scotch.  You embarrassed yourself and you embarrassed your friends.  But you provided me with an interesting introduction for today's online journal entry, ""The Party"", so I guess I can't hate you - not entirely.
 
So against my better judgment, and despite repeated proclamations that I am, indeed, going to cut back on my alcohol consumption, I got sauced with Liza twice this weekend.  Friday we consumed two bottles of red wine and polished off the Jameson from my freezer, all in the name of party preparation.  Liza's job was to cook and she did, freezing fruit for the punch, making a sundried tomato and tofu dip, Texas cornbread, brownies, spinach and artichoke dip, pita chips and a plethora of other equally appetizing finger foods.  And my job, the better of the two, so far as I can see, was to entertain, to keep her awake, to joke and laugh and sample a bit of everything.  Sauced herself, she asked if she could borrow two of the charcoal sketches from my apartment for the party.  She framed them and hung them above the bed.  I have to tell you that I was immensely flattered and pleased by this.

Saturday we rolled a wooden spool onto Liza's porch and positioned as many seats around it as we could get.  Her entire department, the dept. of Philosophy, were invited to attend - and encouraged to bring along dates, roommates and friends.  A rather sizeable group showed up, sat slouched around the spool with cocktails and Dixie plates full of food, stood on the lawn, wandered through the apartment and into the kitchen filled with the warm smells of food and baked goods, and danced, when liquored up enough.

And despite the anxiety I sometimes get when thrown, like a cat into a bathtub, into a group of strangers, I had a good time too.   I doused myself in the punch, comprised almost entirely of rum, in beer and in Jameson Irish Whiskey.  And I fell deeply in love with the artists, with the bohemian and with the politically minded.

M. and I hugged.  I told him any time, any, he wants to visit that I live around the corner.  He's a gay Republican, maybe the world's only gay Republican.  He's extremely pro-life, but liberal in most other ways.  And because of his own illness, which caused a whooping hospital bill of over a million dollars, he is an advocate of universal health care.  He is going back to school for social work so that he can help other people.  I love this man.  He has such beauty, such heart.  I think it rare to feel such affection for a person so soon after introduction - but he is amazing.

""Thought I was going to have to get up and hit that guy,"" said the other M, a hippie sort of fellow with the long stringing hair and the goth girlfriend with the great boots that laced up to her knees.  I like anybody who will watch my back.  And both he and his girlfriend G. are artists - which I deeply admire.  We exchanged emails and they are supposed to send me samplings of their work.

T. told Liza that I am cute -  and I'm glad he thought so. 

I've promised to let another artist borrow my digital camera to take some electronic copies of his work.  Perhaps it was because he was handsome and spoke with an accent that I could not say ""no"" and handed over my phone number with ease.  

My friend Jessica took a picture of her cleavage and kissed Manuel on a dare.

L. threw up in the bathroom.

Overall, it was an entirely successful event and everyone got on well.  Well, everyone except you and I, correct?

You told me that I want to fuck you.  I laughed in your face and told you that you were the most ridiculous man I'd ever met.  Your friends (or are they colleagues only?) asked if I was okay and I announced to one and all what you just said to me.

I felt bad when you became sullen, quiet, pouting.  Maybe I shouldn't have done that, not in front of the people you work with.  Maybe I shouldn't have embarrassed you.  But you shouldn't have kept clawing and groping and kissing when I showed obvious disinterest.  

You passed out in the chair and no one could wake you.  Liza threw a glass of water in your face and T. carried you back to the car and into your apartment.

At 4:30 a.m., the last of the houseguest, you and I, T. and L., said goodnight.  I spent all day Sunday alternating between sleeping and reading, with sleep winning out in the end.  I bet you were hung-over, sick and grouchy.  I bet T. reminded you of what an asshole you had been."

"event","The shooting of a man wielding an, as of yet, unidentified object by a National Guardsman was all over the news this morning, replaying itself over and over as I fell out of bed, scraped the fruit off a leftover and rather unappetizing desert for breakfast, and dressed for work.  

Jessica turned up the volume on the radio as I slipped into the passenger seat of her Toyota.  She was listening to talk radio, local news programming.  Apparently, the aforementioned National Guard incident is the first time a National Guardsman has shot a weapon since the troops return Post-K.  

Alright, so here's my question, and I mean it, honestly, in the best way possible.  What is the National Guard doing to assist in the rebuilding of New Orleans?  Initially, I was under the impression that they were brought back to deter the growing murder rate and to ease the pressure on an understaffed and overworked police force.  Was I delusional?  I see them all the time in tv news reels, walking a murder scene with the NOPD.  I see them having lunch at the Holiday Inn downtown.  But what are they doing?  The shooting continues.  The murder rate soars.  It is the NOPD that releases the press info and investigates.  Jessica believes the Guardsmen are here solely to protect damaged properties from continued looting.  Can this be true?  Then why didn't someone tell us that from the beginning?!  I am highly disillusioned - and frightened by the fact that nothing has been done to curb the escalating violence.

Why is it that no reporter has asked the most obvious question of all?  What was in the guy's hand?  Was it a gun, a knife, a television set, his own hairy...

Okay, so maybe everyone is doing the best that they can.  And maybe I am overreacting because I'm upset by this endless and unnecessary killing.  But, please, for the love of God, somebody give me some information, some statistics!!!  How many more calls are the police responding to, how much quicker is their response time, as a result of the National Guards occupation?  How many times has a guardsman diffused a dangerous situation?  And is there any other way we can better utilize them to make the city safer?  Just give me the facts - both good and bad.  It feels, sometimes, like I'm in the dark about all but my chances of being shot and killed here."

I smoke to keep the mosquitoes off.  The dirty white billows drift above our heads making shapes like dreams, like the constellations in a sky of midnight blue.  A penny for your dirty thoughts...

My jokes are silly and tired and sometimes I think that you don't understand them the way you don't understand me.  It's okay, though.  Isn't it just an empty fantasy anyway?  I'm not coming over - and you're not coming in with me.  

Sometimes my drunken brain trips over things and I forget words as I am saying them, forget what it is I mean to tell you, forget all the things I thought I'd use to impress.  What's left is coarse, hard and raw.  But there is beauty in that too I guess, though I'm not sure you see it.  Your eyes reveal everything and nothing about you.

And so we're alone, you and I, together drinking and cursing and praying and breathing - but just barely.  It's kind of a lonely world, isn't it?

"event","Sometimes, lately at any rate, I find it hard to see the beauty here over the extreme poverty, the violence, and the dirty filthy mess left by tourists, as well as that goddamn storm.  There are car swallowing potholes, old metal shopping carts abandoned miles from any stores and, yesterday, a car stripped and burnt left in a vacant parking lot.

I missed the bus yesterday, which did not aid my foul mood, and waited nearly an hour for the next RTA.  Isn't it supposed to run every 30 minutes - or is it ever 15 weekdays, every 30 weekends? Sweat was rolling down my forehead, dripping off my nose, and, if not wet enough already, most of the seats in the bus were wet due to leaking air conditioners and windows.  I thought to myself, ""Why, why am I here?  Why am I living like this?""

By the time I reached home, I was aggravated and starving.  And so, rather than cook on my little half-sized efficiency stove (that I'm paying far too much rent for), I dropped my stuff at the living room door and walked to Whole Foods for a bit of prepared grub.  And only in route home from the grocery saw...

A Roman Candy Cart pulled by a white mule meandered up Octavia.  Is he servicing Magazine Street now or was he just on his way home from his post outside the school houses on St. Charles?  The vendor hollered, ""Hey, ho, hey,"" in a deep rich voice, and the mule halted at the intersection, waiting at the stop sign for traffic to pass before trotting through.  And, as if on queue, an older gentleman in a seersucker coat and straw hat sauntered by, out for an evening stroll.  He nodded toward me, bowed slightly, and tipped his hat.  

Something in my heart just clicked then - and the softness returned.  Was it only my imagination or did the songs ""Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans,"" and ""I Wish I were in New Orleans"" seem to echo through the alleyways.  No, no, I guess it was only in my head that they played, ridiculously sentimental.

Uplifted, I walked on.

At home, good news!  The neighbors are plotting a return to recycling.  Post-K, the city dropped its contract with the company that collected city recyclables.  For the past year, all sorts of reusables have ended up on the curb and in the landfills.  Jeff has a truck; Liza, Andrea and I have the will.  And Jeff found a drop-off point.  It seems like such a small thing.  But to me brings back some normalcy ... and it seems proof that some folks still give a damn.  Sometimes it is the small things...

So today I'm feeling good, positive for a change, though things remain far from stable.  We'll see what tomorrow brings."

I was walking to work, two bottles of water in a Walgreens bag and last night's tofu dish in a plastic container both stuffed down in a Whole Foods brown paper bag.  I thought she would ask.   I started taking inventory.  Would she eat the tofu?  Should I give her the water and a couple of dollars for some snacks instead?

And still she shuffled, first toward me, and then by me, her wilted feet planted into over-sized shoes.  She never looked up at me, not once.  It seemed she never saw me or the endless progression of automobiles and ambulances, police cruisers and oil tankers whizzing by on the Avenue.  

Where was she off to?  Was she walking into some light only she could see, on an escalator moving forward while the rest of us fade into the blackness behind, beneath?"

"event","The New Orleans crazies are alive and well...and I love your big ole eccentric hearts!
While the future of the city is still shimming itself under the limbo pole, as the nation, the politicians, and the naysayer hold their breaths, wondering whether or not she will pull herself back up and stand erect or fall, you nutty partygoers are urging her to shimmy harder, lower, to take the risks.  Are we the only ones crazy enough to care?

""It made me remember why I love this city,"" M. said this morning when I asked about her neighborhood block party, an anniversary shindig for a homosexual couple together for more years than I've been living.  Champagne flowed from midday until 11 p.m. - and slices of crabmeat cheesecake served up on Dixie plates.  The foods, the festivity, the diversity, and the folks who holler out, ""How's ya mom and 'dem?"" in an accent that sounds a little bit Southern and little bit Jersey are all what makes this city such a great place to be.  It just seems lately that all that has gotten hidden behind the piles of trash, the debris, buried beneath frightening crimes statistics and police reports.

Does one need Xanax, St. John's Wort or some other mood altering drug or herb to make it here, now, post-K?  The debate goes on.  M. brought me an envelop full of ""the Wort"" last week.  She too has had problems readjusting and she has found some comfort in herbal remedies.  I accept them politely, but cannot take them due to those notorious clashes it has with other medications like...err...birth control.  And for me I'm not sure it's the right time for that anyway.  I've been hiding painful things for so long under blankets of alcohol, that I think its best to try first to deal with the present (and past) straight on.  And if I can't do it, then I guess it's time to get some therapy...or medication.

I went for cocktails Friday with L. and J, even Jeff for a bit.  As usual, we strayed in a pack down Magazine, toward Le Bon Temp, then on to Brothers Three.  Jeff was decked out in Western apparel, sharp-toed boots and a blue and white striped shirt with silver snaps instead of buttons, a joke he claimed, for meeting up with friends later at a country nightclub in Metairie.  Oh, come on now, Jeff, you just so happen to have these things hanging in the closet?  But it worked out just fine, didn't it?  L. had puffy hair and was feeling a little Dolly Pardon, minus the knockers.  And she complimented me on being as gaudy as usual, like an old country performer dressed for the CMAs.  It was almost as nice as Wednesday cocktails on the lawn.

You understand that I like this about New Orleans, this sense of ""neighborhood"", the frequent block parties where inebriated neighbors espouse political views and moral conundrums, where L. proclaims that if one can justify not using stem cells then another can justify necrophilia.    We are a city of friendly people.  We are a city of opinionated people.  And we are a city of misfits.  Maybe that's what makes us all so unsure now; we don't know what's safe anymore, we certainly don't know what to do to fix a problem that can't be fixed without adequate funding, without certified teachers and trained therapists, without regular garbage pickups and affordable rent, without alternatives, and we don't know where else to go when we no longer fit here.

I ran into C. yesterday at the Whole Foods store.  She looked like film noir in a Whole Foods apron with her jet black 20s bob and vintage dress.  Our entire relationship (of two years or more) is entirely based on which bookstore she is working in and which I am buying from the most.  And yet, on several occasions, we have stopped each other between the row of books or on the cracked sidewalks of the city and whispered about difficulties finding work here pre-k - and finding stability post.  A few times she has slipped books into my bag at the counter and, upon discovery, I've returned home and cried about this small act of kindness.  At Christmas, my ex suggested a book of prison tattoos for her boyfriend that was, apparently, a smashing success.  And this week, we might meet up for a cocktail.  

Instead of telling my New Orleans friends goodbye, I seem to be collecting more and more of them - all just as loveably odd as the rest.  It's funny sometimes how you can know you're going to care about someone even before you actually know them.

And so it goes, as part of me longs for somewhere new, somewhere clean and pleasant, the other half of me clings to a city with a culture all its own, with people as eccentric as I feel most days.  I just wish the city didn't devistate me so."

"event","Ask me for a top ten list of things I miss about Ireland.  I'd have to say, ""Only ten?  Is that it?""

It's foolish, really, to think that in two weeks I can get an accurate picture of life there or of what it means to be ""Irish"".  A mere two weeks doesn't give one much time to pick out the flaws in things, flaws that are an inevitable part of any society.  Yet, even realizing that, I have come home with this grand illusion of what life should be like- and of what it actually is, wading through beer bottles and trash and broken glass from vandalized businesses still (tragically) untouched a year post-K. 

I've come home from a relaxing, fascinating f*cking vacation, to a funk of gigantic proportions.  Is it the boarded up French Quarter buildings, the trash that sits untouched on every other corner, the homeless woman who accosted me in front of my office building yesterday, yelling that I had food in a bag actually filled with office supplies, even after I had given her the few bucks I had in my pocket?  Could it be the bureaucratic red tape keeping money from trickling down to people who need it, an ineffective mayor who, quite honestly, I wouldn't mind seeing ousted in a recall election, or the apparent apathy of the people - both locally and nationally?  Maybe I'm just jetlagged.  Maybe I'm just hungry, no longer privy to gigantic breakfasts of fried eggs, two rashers (sausage), two bacons (strips of ham), black pudding (sausage of 99% beef blood), white pudding, toast, soda bread, a pot of tea - and light morning conversations with doting Irish men and women.

""Ah, from New Orleans, are ya?"" an Irishman asked us at the pub.  ""So your president screwed ya, did he?""  Virtually everyone hates Wubya - and who can blame them.  (To say that his diplomatic skills are poor is being kind.)  They wag disapproving fingers at the Iraqi war.  And in Ireland, people accept that global warming really exists and they discuss how this is going to affect future generations, how it is affecting global climate already.  They ask questions curiously and listen eagerly, for the American perspective on life in New Orleans and in ""The States"".  Smart, they are, and charming.  And they give a good goddamn, even when the very people who live here don't. 

Their cars are small, designed in part for the narrow roads.  Even little old ladies with ruddy cheeks and pinched noses like watercolor faeries from a child's picture book, whip around winding mountain roads, sending many a tourist off the nonexistent shoulder, into the stone fences corralling sheep rather ineptly.  But you do not see SUVs or big ""petrol"" guzzling trucks even among the rich, the affluent. Whether a person has status or none, he or she drives a Nissan Micra, a Ford Focus or some other petite economy automobile.

As the ATM sucked my plastic into and out of its hungry mouth, it flashed a guilt-trip at me in big bold letters.  Oh, my God, how much litter ends up in landfills each year?  How many trees are killed?  No, thanks, I don't need that receipt after all.  You keep it.  And so it goes, U.S. landfills fill up and tons of trash are moved around by barge while in Ireland, with the exception of graffiti and disposed of waste around seaside pull-offs frequented by tourists, the land is green and clean.

Even the cities have retreats, ""gardens of the senses"".  In Tralee, Co. Kerry, the park is filled with roses of every variety and the air is alive with their perfume.  In Sneem, Co. Kerry, folks drawing an unemployment pension were employed for a time to build, plant, and prune a community park, to give those said unemployed a position of importance in the community and a sense of pride in a job done well.  Many of the Irish parks (and park upgrades) are funded by a national ""Tidy Town"" contest.  The Irish, you see, recognize the value of parks, both for the health of the community & residents, and for tourism.

I climbed out on the craggy rocks into a clear sea of green and sapphire blue.  I watch a small fish dart between my feet in a puddle that collected there, in one of the crevices rubbed into stone.  And the air smelled crisp and salty.  It was, remains, one of my favorite moments of the vacation, one of the few moments of peace I've had over the last year.  I damn well miss it now. 

The Ring of Kerry was some of the most beautiful terrain I have ever seen - sheep in the road and all.

At the Blue Bull (pub and restaurant) in Sneem, I tumbled head-over-heels (no, not for Gerald, Lyndsie, though he did make me want to do cartwheels) for Gaelic and Australian football (thanks to Lyndsie's new boyfriend, Barry).  Sneem, while perhaps the sleepiest town in the whole of Ireland, is maybe my favorite place in the universe.  The people there are warm, friendly and accepting.  And Norm and Margaret at the Bank House serve the best damn black pudding...and hospitality...in Ireland.

And let's not talk of the ""Celtic Disco"" we sang along to from midget stools at Mother Kelly's in Dublin.  That was true craic.  I laughed until tears streamed down my eyes as our new friend ""Second Legged"" (a treat for two girls used to 'Nawlins Second Lining) around the pub for our amusement.

Was I at home then, in Ireland, or now?  I'm honestly not sure.  My heart quivers like water when the surface is touched, the stillness broken.  And the reflection of things is distorted, blurry.  I think I might cry."

"event","Ireland is coming!  Ireland is here!
 
Sitting at my work station, beating out nervous melodies with a plastic ink pen against the fake wood grain of the desk, I think, surely, I cannot be here, at the office, acting as if the week, the world is entirely normal.  On Thursday, aided in part by a Xanax tablet prescribed for plane anxiety & claustrophobia, and perhaps an airport Bloody Mary, I'll board a flight out of town - then out of country.  No more listening to a news anchor with big hair and Botox count the number of murders in New Orleans in one day using the fingers on both hands (and soon her bare feet)!  No more dull days at the job, watching the digital numbers on the caller ID panel of the office phone count down the hours until sweet freedom.  I am going on vacation for two f*cking weeks.  I am thrilled!

I'm not worried so much about anything but the flying - the walk through the sterile halls of the airport, the rub down that I almost always get at security, for some inexplicable reason, and then, Oh, God, the rise and fall of the great winged machine, the enclosure, entrapment in the small cabin, and turbulence that mocks every crash scene in every movie where a passenger dies (and perhaps is eaten by fellow passengers turned cannibal).

I woke from a nightmare this morning at 2:30.  It is one of the only times I can remember ever waking up in tears.  And, it had nothing whatsoever to do with trip anxiety or flying, but, rather, hurt, guilt, manic drunken nights I barely understand...loose ends.  I hate leaving lose ends.

So one grouchy friend will, upon reading this, if he reads this, will immediately ring my phone, at god only knows what time in the morning, and rant about how we all have choices and how excuses are for losers.  But, while I do believe in free will, I am also a firm believer in cause and effect.  Kids don't grow up with the dream of becoming a drug lord of the ghetto.  It is a result of poverty, of hard knocks, of growing up feeling outside the system - in a word, hopelessness.  Similarly, abusive fathers & mothers don't develop that rage without first experiencing it from someone themselves (though there are exceptions).  

I have problems.  I have ""issues"".  We all do, I guess.  Mine started with my mother.  They were indulged, cultivated, propagated via religion.  And then the weak, childlike naivete and need at the core of me was used in the most abusive ways.  

Two stable relationships saved me from dealing with this shit and I became a stable enough person - and responsible.  But now, years later, without a strong support mechanism, I find myself hating myself, being more self-destructive then I've ever been, putting myself in the same f*cking positions of vulnerability and feeling guilty, irredeemable, and ready to run myself into a concrete wall or, like the Wiley Coyote, off the edge of a cliff.  The years of being blissfully numb are gone.  And why now?

I had this epiphany at 2:30 this morning.  It is time to talk about this.  It is time to figure out what happened, why I'm reliving it now, and time to let go of it before it takes me down completely.  

But the trip is this week and so I am leaving it, putting it on hold until the return.  And I don't like that.

I don't like loose ends. I don't want to come back and fall into the same horrible patterns."

"event","I think most days I prefer the company of men.  They might not understand my machinations, but they certainly enjoy my candor.  Do women really hide so many things from one another? Do we really feel so envious, mistrustful, and judgmental of more honest women?  I speak evenly to everyone, except for my devout family (and God, I hope they never do find out exactly how I live), and I am not at all too concerned about whether they label me a ""sinner"", an ""alcoholic"", or a ""whore"".  I am none really.  Guys are great in that they can accept this - and, of course, some of the more deviant encourage it.  And I really like the comfortable feeling of smoking and drinking and scratching like one of the boys...so long as they treat me like a lady at appropriate times.

I don't proscribe any type of lifestyle to anyone.  You do it your way and let me do it mine.  And for me, maybe because I write and, therefore must chase the experiential, maybe because I live alone, maybe because I get lonely, maybe just because I am independent, I live a little more radically - and I find the idea of ""taboos"" distasteful. I am sorry if that too is offensive. 

I don't always do the right thing.  I admit this - I'll admit that I can be stupid and impetuous.  And sometimes guilt saddles me and rides me around like a trick pony, beating me with a braided whip, jabbing me with rusty spurs, until I ride the right direction.  But I wouldn't feel so fucking bad if I wasn't a good person.  And I wouldn't be so willing to pour my heart out ... or hand it over ... when I care about someone.

Lately, my group of friends has wobbled, shifted.  I have lost some to Post-K moves, some to my deviant behavior (and their ""annoyingly unspoken"" disapproval), and some I'm not exactly sure why aren't speaking, though I suspect they are angry with me or imagine that I am angry with them.  And there are new friends, gal pals, sort of showing up at my door, with the same straight forward talk and crooked smiles that I have.  This is...a pleasant turn of events.

I am the ""special child"" at the office, the youngest of only two woman still fertile, I imagine, and older coworkers have adopted me, some bravely sharing the dark secrets of their past and x-rated jokes and exploits over afternoon cocktails.  And I do adore A., M., C., because they are so open, generous, funny - and have so much experience and wisdom.  But it feels almost odd now to have new women with strong (is it a mature or a masculine quality?) personalities, one slightly younger, the other slightly older than me - women I like and in my age range!  Ha!  I will no longer be the most offensive person at dinner parties...or the smartest either.  And I'm really fine with that.  With them I don't feel like a member of a one-woman club.  

I wanted to discuss this more in detail, but just discovered time to go home.  Part II to come."

"event","I am leaving for Ireland on September 7.  I have done nothing to prepare.  A short list of must-dos to follow:

1.  Drop tax papers off at the Post Office.  

Orleans Parish received an extension as a result of that K-word that shall not be uttered on this, the one year anniversary.  I prefer, instead, to refer to it as the anniversary of the Memphis evacuation with B.  In a Memphis motel bathroom, I wrapped a towel around me and tucked the corners between my breasts, gathered courage, cracked the door, stuck my head out into the bedroom and said, ""B., incase I do not tell you later, thank you for bringing me...and I love you.""  I shut the door, showered, and did my damnedest to pretend it never happened.  It was the first time I said those words to him.

2.  Somehow, sort of, in some way, obtain basic information on digital cameras and, an even harder task, find a reasonably priced one.

I cringe at the thought of having film from the trip destroyed by airport security equipment.  Equally taxing, finding the said photo equipment within walking, biking or busing distance.  Perhaps Office Depot (or is it Office Max) on St. Chuck or, God help me, the Magazine Street Radio Shack?

3.  Must, must, must make keys for the apartment.  In order to do this, the current key will have to be bent - or unbent, rather.  

My keys are distributed all over this city - in muck left by flood waters that swallowed up friends' houses in Lakeview and Midcity, in the ""lost and found"" box at local bars where I left them after one too many Jamesons, hanging unmarked and anonymous from long neglected key rings in other apartments.  So I have to start over.  I must make and distribute keys to Jessica, Liza - maybe Jeff or Brian?    

4.  I need to photocopy my passport, my credit cards, my driver's license - and my breasts.  (Just thought I would throw that last one in there to make sure you are still paying attention.)  

This is an integral part of any ""Oh, Shit Emergency Plan"".  Jessica keeps a copy.  A copy goes into my luggage...or in my bra...or wherever I can safely keep it incase my purse is erroneously left at a pub on my birthday (09/10).  (Okay, so the bra isn't my best option for security ... blush.)

5.  I must stock up on cat food, cat litter and hairball treats.  Jessica volunteered to check on Kitty (and clean my apartment) while I am away.  I have left very stern instructions that, should something become of my very old, old cat, no one will tell me until I have returned from vacation.

6. Pay all bills and notify landlord (again) of departure.    


I'll probably take a half work day Thursday or Friday.  Must not consume too much alcohol Friday night so that I can be productive Saturday ...  guess that's why hit the Quarter Sunday and Le Bon Temp Monday."

"event","I am cleaning out the rest of it, before Ireland, before I decide what I am going to do, where I am going, and before life is snuffed out, as inevitably happens when one drawls breath, breathes in daily carcinogens, drives through the Wendy's pickup window, drinks until the liver is hard, hurts until the heart is hard equitably, and suffers from random bouts of deep and frightening depression.  It is like reaching up into the corners of the ceiling and swiping at the cobwebs, getting down on the knees and pulling all the shit out from under the bed (except in my case, the bed frame broke and the mattresses are stacked like river rafts on the floor).   Just a little more, just a tiny bit more, Mel-odrama and I swear I will go back to anti-Bush rhetoric and city life, poetry and pictures.

This weekend B. took me to dinner at Vegas Tapas in Old Metairie.  B., who I have loved, obsessed over, confessed to, slept with, dreamed of, drank with, and hated, over the very short duration of this online journal (see entries July 25, June 1, May 18th, May 5th - and if none else, May 8th) and since moving to Magazine Street a few years ago, has officially expressed interest in a certain friend he has been talking much about in recent weeks.   And so, Saturday, I had to make the decision that every good and loyal friend deeply in love with a friend who does not reciprocate has to make.  I did the right thing, I know, but spent all Sunday crying over it.  But don't worry guys.  I am just waving goodbye to it (very slowly).

B. had a tragic loss several years ago.  And I worry.  Perhaps his decision to remain an eligible man-about-town is indeed because a.) he prefers the company of many woman; b.) he is career oriented; c.) his priority now if finding and purchasing a piece of New Orleans property.  But I worry anyway.  I worry that he does not let people get close enough...that he is only comfortable around those who know great loss...that he is going to spend his entire life alone, not because he wants to be, but because he is afraid of the responsibility that comes with relationships, afraid that whether intentionally or unintentionally he is going to hurt someone.  Or that if he loves a woman, he will lose her.

He mentioned M. as we were sipping from glasses of deep red wine.  I put my glass down.  I took a breath that hurt like a thousand daggers.

""You have been talking about M. a lot lately.  You really are starting to care about her, aren't you?""

He explained here that they had always been friends.  Only recently she has become single and the amount of time they spend together has increased exponentially.

""As much as I hate to do this, I want to give you advice,"" I told him.  ""It hurts me because I am jealous and because I adore you and you know I adore you.  But if you really like this girl, then you should go after her.""

He told me that I am a cool chick.  I hate being cool.  I want to be selfish.  I want to horde his time and his company and his cheesy jokes and his little body and large brain.

""I don't know why you hold back from people, why you are so afraid to care about one person too deeply.  I realize that you are career oriented and goal oriented.  Maybe you think that you'll have to give all that away.  But if you are straight forward about what you want, a lot of women will understand, a lot of women won't make you choose between them and your career - and a lot will understand your dedication.""

And then he tells me about M's tragic losses.

""You cannot build relationships based on loss.  A. would not tolerate being an excuse not to move forward.  It's great that you and M. can bond over these tragedies, but that isn't something to build relationships on.""

Dinner was nice.  But I didn't like hearing that he is thinking about M. in that way.  And I don't like that I can't compete with a professional artist who projects films on the lawn.  

I wish I didn't love you.

My heart is a red velvet pin cushion . . . and I have been stuck.

I kissed you in the car.  I thought I could.  I leave for Ireland soon.  I thought by the time I returned the shame would be gone and I could look at you again without blushing.  But the guilt was there immediately after the kiss and I muttered that despite the kiss you should take my advice, go for M.

Scott and Amy asked me to the Quarter last night to cheer me up.  I met a nice man.  I gave him my number, but don't know whether he will ask me out.  He said he wanted to see me again before I leave for Ireland.  But it doesn't matter much really, does it?  It does not stop me from feeling...what is this feeling?    

I hate it.  And I love you.  So please go be happy."

"event","She is hippy, voluptuous and slightly whorish, but in an appealing sort of way.  There are chunky, clunky gold bracelets dangling from both wrists and a cigarette in vintage holder clutched between two fingers.  The bubble caption above her melancholy expression reads:  ""Really, what is there about me that simply invites trouble?""

Jono found the vintage cartoon in an ""Inside Art"" story in the New York Times over the weekend.  He photocopied it and asked Mavis to bring it to me first thing this week.  It's not the likeness so much (or at all even).  It is the essence, I think, feminine, sexual, and a bit overly dramatic, over done.  But don't get me wrong - nothing to offend.  She is gorgeous.  And it is definitely the sentiment:  What is it about me...

I have been thinking quite a bit about this lately myself.  And I have reached a conclusion.  Are you ready for this?  (Shouldn't really require much thought, as is relatively obvious.)

I am at my ""best worst"" when I am bored - unchallenged.  Let us review, shall we: 

My job is dull, easy.  I leave work feeling brain dead. 

I'm not writing.  I'm not sketching. I have no outlet and lots of energy. 

I've just ended what was the shortest relationship I've ever been involved in and no one I am dating now even remotely challenges me.  (B. doesn't count.  For months, much to my chagrin, we have been entirely platonic.)

And so, to stimulate myself, I find trouble - because at least it gives me some situation to think my way out of. 

That's okay I guess, part of the experience of living.  It is just when it becomes dangerous...  And I've never lived as precariously as I have been lately.

And then there are still remnants of my family's religion embedded in me.  The result - mania is usually followed by episodes of guilt, remorse, worry."

For the 30 minutes she sat, wiggled, made sour faces, groaned, and dug at her hipbones with fingertips, I was on ""Baby Watch"" ready to spring from my own rolling office chair to wheel her out and down the corridor - to grease her up with petroleum jelly if necessary just to ease her movement through a doorway that she claims is getting progressively smaller. 

That child can be birthed anywhere but here, a storage closet converted to an office, a tiny and dismal space crammed tight with furniture and file cabinets.  The windows are painted shut as if to say, ""You may enter but then you're stuck.  Tough shit.""  

Life is hard enough - and success allusive.  To start out here, would be a jinx, or an obstacle the new little human would spend his or her entire life trying to overcome or at least live down.  Even with a brilliant yellow and red painting and daily motivation quotes from a Tough Dames calendar, the room feels stifling, depressing, monotonous.

"event","The first time she threw the line, she threw it far and fast.  The cork on the line hit the water and bounced, floating orange and white on the surface.

She waited, patient, quiet, lulled by the ripple of the water beneath her boat.  And then she felt it, the sharp, hard tug of a catch.  A film of sweat broke out on her forehead.  Her heart beat hard against her chest, exhilarated, alive, and whole.  She reeled, rolled, and rocked the line in toward her.

A white sharp face broke the surface, grinning wildly with razor teeth.  It punched and pounded with cold fins, a slapping sound against her skin.  Then throwing its massive body atop her, it grabbed with snapping teeth at her breasts -and it ate out half her heart.  

She never felt quite the same again.  

So the second time she cast her line, she cast it halfheartedly.  She watched the clear line stretch out across the open water, watched it sink beneath the surface to a depth she could not measure.  And she waited, pensive - but not altogether without hope of reeling in a good catch.

The line pulled hard to the left, then to the right.  This fish was big, beautiful, with blue-green scales.  It fought against her, racing under the boat, then back out to sea, first in front of her, then behind her.  And then, it gave up the game, throwing itself at her with the velocity of a torpedo.  

The swordfish took out an eye.  He half-blinded her, then back-flipped from the boat's edge and plopped back into open water.

She wondered whether or not she would be able to throw the line again.  It seemed, after two tries, that the risk was worse than the promise.  She knew she must be careful not to lose her heart or to become too blind.  And so she cast the line closer by, in shallower waters and waited until the sun hung low in the sky.  

The pull came from beneath the boat this time and was gentler.  She urged it out with a gentle pull of the line.  The creature emerged slowly, bit by bit, from the water - a long bodied eel.  And as soon as she pulled it into the boat, it shocked her.  She threw it back with a frustrated howl and vowed that she would never be shocked again.

Now she sits by the waters edge, on a sandy beach or on a grassy bank.  And she loves the fish that she cannot have, the one that swims nearest but is quick to dart away.  Isn't it the safest, the smartest?  No more dropping lines.  No more corks or worms or other dangled bait.  

This is no light-hearted sport.  It takes heart (and she only has half) and vision (and she only has half) and bravery.  It takes a willingness to lose everything."

It occurs to me now that this is probably a ""date"" - which is altogether, for a dozen reasons or more, a horrible idea.  How can I back out without hurting feelings?  (Insert hardy sigh here.)  I have such an overpowering need for attention that I find myself in all sorts of unsavory situations.

And if that isn't enough, Fodil and I had our first argument last night.  English is his...um...fifth (?) language.  He speaks it very well - but there are concepts he does not exactly grasp.  If I am ""insecure"" or ""nervous"" about our relationship, he thinks that I am upset with him.  It doesn't even occur to him that maybe, just maybe, I have not been in a committed relationship for some time and that I am not altogether sure I will be good at it anymore.  (Or that I might be worried he doesn't know me well enough ...or that I can't be monogamous...or that I have some emotional baggage...or that I am worried our relationship is purely based on...)  How can you tell someone, ""It is me, not you"" and not sound like you are dumping them?  Anyway, he wants me to come over this evening when he gets off work.  He is lighting candles and bringing a bottle of wine.  I am bringing a sexy nightgown and two bottle of Liquid Plummer to fix his clogged, clogged sink.  (I do find that I want to take care of him.)

But this means I must keep track of time and I must leave the dinner party before eleven.  I shouldn't drink too much or smoke.  I'll have to have enough cash on me for a cab ride to South Carrolton.  Dinner and romance should be fun - not come attached to all this anxiety.

Did I mention that his apartment is completely bare except for an old futon?  He wants me to help decorate.  That does feel a bit commitment-like.  Jessica laughed when I told her.  She said I should bring a couple of my nude paintings over for artwork.

For anyone reading who doesn't know me, my paintings/sketches are a bit...ur...psychotic."

"event","After a beer and two dirty martinis with Jessica and a bottle of Chimay with Jeff, I asked F. M., ""What is the nature of our relationship?  What are the rules?""  Apparently, my understanding of it and his has been different from the beginning.  Of course, I suspected as much.  Our cultural clash:

Dating ""men"" is cheating on ""a man"". 

""Why would you want to do that?""  he asked.

He is coming back to town tonight (will see him at 11:30 p.m.) and I am going to have to make a decision.  ""To be or not to be,"" Shakespeare would suggest.  Am I ready for this?  Do I want to be the girlfriend of an immigrant (Arabic/Algerian) restaurateur?   I don't know if we know enough about each other.  

But he does seem to have a heart of gold.

It feels like ""Last Call"".  Gentlemen, anyone up for one last beer?  If any of you think you might fancy (love) me, better say so now.

I think I might try this - with certain conditions.  First, he cannot monopolize me.  I have friends male and female and I will continue to see them, the male and the female.  There can be no jealousy.  My word is good.  I do not ""cheat"". He need not ask me who I am going out with.  Second, he needs to maintain this level of interest.  Perhaps he can capture my attention - but can he keep it.  Third, I am not a possession.  I don't care how much he disapproves of what I do or with whom I do it, I will make my own choices.  ""Thank you, come again.""

I had a relationship with a man from Pakistan once.  He tried to control me some.  I guess that is partially what is making me so guarded.

I shouldn't be over thinking this so much.  There is nothing to be afraid of.  I'll enjoy the ride.  If he ""changes"", I'll extract myself from the relationship.

I do like him. I think I'd kick myself if I didn't at least make an effort."

No living room lights.
No bathroom lights.
No television.
No radio.
No Problem? 

Yes.  Big Problem.

Going to the French Quarter tonight to stay with friends.  Landlord is coming to look at the apartment this evening.  As far as I know, he has no working knowledge of electrical wiring.  This means, that unless he comes on the arm of an electrician, it could be some time before my life goes back to being normal.  

Does this mean I still owe him the entire rent?  Bollocks.

F. M. will be back in town on Friday.  He has offered to let me stay with him & I think I might take him up on it.  My only concern is the three days in between.  S. slated to be a my friend's this evening.  I know that it would be a bit unreasonable for F. M. to expect full committal from me so early on.  Yet, he is entirely sweet and intensely romantic and if it is going somewhere, I don't want to mess it up or to hurt him.

I'm exhausted.  I need sleep.  Instead, I am at work, watching the clock, waiting to walk over to the building on Canal to record the stupid phonetree for the office.  What a distasteful morning!"

"event","Fuse blew in my apartment this morning.  The ""guts"" of the fuse came out with the fuse bulb and so I still have no lights or ceiling fan in the apartment.  

Almost missed Jessica's warning call. I almost didn't see her parked by the curb in front of the house. as I leaned over to pet Skit-Skat, R.'s black cat, who was covered in cobwebs and strattled like a whore on my front steps.

Date at 11 pm tonight.   Urg.  I'm so tired.  He owns (and is a chef at) a restaurant and will be there until closing tonight.  He was going to take me to the Marigny again, where we met, but I begged off due to sheer exhaustion.  I would rather do something requiring less travel time, something that will have me in bed sometime before 6 in the morning.  Instead, maybe we will have drinks at St. Joe's or Le Bon Temp or Dos Jefes.  Or maybe we will watch some Netflix and drink that bottle of Pinot Noir beneath a blanket in the dark, cool, filthiness of my apartment.  

Wonder if he can fix a fuse box? 

Perhaps I will call some friends and see if anyone wants to have dinner with me until F. M. gets off work.  It's either that or more soup and salad from Wholefoods soup and salad bars.

He called me ""Baby"".  We have only been on one official date and spent one evening together at Spotted Cat/Molly at the Market.  This is troubling.  But his voice sounded very sweet and gentle and I could not tell him 'no'."

I got three offers last night while doing nothing more than cleaning my apartment & catching up on other domestic duties (ie groceries, dinner, laundry).  Feng Shui, what have you done to me?

I'm going out with Mandi tonight.  Very nervous...

Feel horrible about turning S. down.  Last night was the first time he's talked to me since Scott set us up a few weeks ago.  We've been friends forever and I know that he is having a difficult time right now.  Slap on some guilt for some perceived injustice that he thinks he's done to me and what you have is a man in a mess.  I promised I'd come see him soon.  But he didn't seem pacified by that."

"event","I woke up with Barry Manilow's ""Oh, Mandy"" playing in my head.  Oh, Mandi, (pronounced ""Mondi""), I am not sure whether this bit of information offends or flatters.  Being near you excites me - but Manilow?  Give me a break already!

I was nervous leaving the house Saturday.  J. called with instructions to dress up for Quarter play.  I did, in a black skirt with a scarlet scarf draped around and knotted at the hip and a black low-cut velvet top.  I painted on my favorite scarlet lipstick.   My lips looked full, plump, the color of garden roses. I joked that we were ladies on the prowl.  She laughed at my edginess, my superstition, this deep gut feeling that something beyond my control was about to happen and that, whatever it was, it would not be good.

""Well, I have a feeling, that things are going to be very fine,"" she countered.  ""We are going to have a good time.  And we're not going to get too retarded [ie drunk].""

But maybe we did - just a little?  We walked out of Molly at Market at 6 a.m. and, after a mad dash through the McDonald's drive-through, she dropped me off in front of my apartment at about 6:30.

But I am not sorry.  She was right.  I met you. You held my hand and kissed me sweetly.

You said that you did not speak English well.  But you could throw a compliment my way and...sigh...I would find your English quite exceptional.  

You are romantic and intense. 
 
(Pause)

Honestly, I find that sort of scary.  

(Pause)

"event","Does there come a point in a relationship between a guy friend and a girl friend when it is just too damn late for flirtation - I mean, other than the friendly sort?   It is like throwing oneself (repeatedly) off a cliff onto the rocky, craggy shoreline.  I am taking a bruising and the crabs are auctioning off the pieces.  But though he is completely unaware of my intentions (which I assure you are not completely pure), the pursuit is not without merit.  Sometimes I miss the rocks and hit cool blue water.  He smiles, we joke and throw back a couple of beers.  And there really is nothing better than sitting around, shooting the shit, being one of the guys.

Don't know what has got into me lately anyway.  I have never had a problem getting asked out (or invited home, for that matter) by new and interesting (if not somewhat crazy) men.  But lately, I am more interested in those closer to home - in friends, neighbors and folks I have known forever.  Is it the challenge of trying to get something that I know intellectually should be off limits?  Haven't I learned anything from that night with S.?  Is it because I want to wake up with a friend?  I dunno.  It is what it is.  Why try to explain it?

But even when fruitless, must admit that I derive a certain satisfaction from the pursuit.  Flirting is fun and, frankly, sometimes I get caught up in it."

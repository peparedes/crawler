"event","I see you fading away from us.
I'll miss you very much.
Room with empty bottles, broken dreams,
and pride still running high, always on your side



Wake the ones and rise tonight
Fallen souls we shine so bright
Rise now and ever
forgotten memories


Nothing hurts my world,
just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood,
you'll be the one to fall.


Give me your hand,
blood is spilt and man will follow
infernal man, punishment too great to bear


I've come here to kill you,
won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance,
I closed my brothers eyes tonight



With this ink in our skin we've sealed our fate,
and the axe comes early



I'm alone in here
No more feelings
Killed my fears
Don't ask
you'll never know
you're left behind and I'll be exposed


Black enchanting eyes,
cut through my heart
with no regret or sign of life




They tear apart my pride
and cold runs through my veins
I feel their stare from miles
haunting every step
and they won't stop hunting me down



They'll find you alone
and your desperate and villainous ways
Turning their hearts into stone
they seek more then vengeance




We keep writing, talking and planning, but everything's changing. 
We all know what to do but no one does it. 
Now this time has passed and full of regret.
Two in my heart have left me a while, I stand alone.



Never will I forget you, and all the memories past. 
So rarely I get to see your face. 
Growing I looked to you in guidance.
We knew that time would kill us, but you're still so close to me.


To me you were my life. 
To me you were my soul companion. 
Now you are so far away. 
Nothing can take away the time and the memories we had.
Come back



Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight



Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved



Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide...suicide




Dust begins to fall, to the ground
The air is cold and thin
Thoughts are haunting me as I look around
This will never end and I'll bleed forever



You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination always unknown, I'll find my way there
But you Goddamn Motherfuckers always wasting my time


Play your game you better walk away cause your integrity don't mean shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out



I'd do anything for a smile, holding you 'til our time is done
We both know the day will come, but I don't want to leave you



Eveybody wit me drunk as fuck, break it down, then roll it up
Back it up, a girl like you, a nigga like me can't pass it up
Rollin by, lookin good, put it in reverse then back it up


A wraith with an angel's body
A demon with a smile of gold
You soulsucker
I won't become like you



Look how pretty she is when she falls down
Now there is no beauty in bleeding mascara
Lip are quivering like a withering rose
She's back again


What the fuck do you think love means?
It's much more than words and feelings sucking me dry
Is my marrow that sweet?


I can see her now
Dancing around, her drink in hand
All her baggage in tow
I just want to forget and let go
Of all the joy, all of the pain
I took your guilt and placed it into me
And now I kiss it goodbye
Our last dance ended fatall



Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?
Have you ever cried so hard?
Baby you just died



There she goes again
Another masquerade in false circumstance
She'll fuck you just for the taste
I just wish I could replace all the memories
Of what makes my blood run cold
And as your blood flows through me
I say goodbye to what we had



She came and went
I gnawed through my lip
Makeup smeared in her eyes
Each sob's a reason to say goodbye.
Sometimes when you're holding on
You'll never see the light



I feel eyelashes on my cheek
And they lacerate my flesh
A pain so good
Put your hand in mine
Never let go



Feels likes you could kiss my imperfections
My imperfections away
And I would stand
Stand by your side until the sun turns the sky
All the colors I see in your eyes



I swear to you, on everything I am
And I dedicate to you all that I have
And I promise you that I will stand right by your side
Forever and always until the day I die



The bite marks on my neck never felt so good
I'm losing control and it's all that I can do
Not to blackout and fall into lust with you
Your kisses infect me
The dark gift is loving you


And I feel immortal and I want to make you feel the same
So stand by me as we immulate
We can burn in each other's arms



Will you still hold me when you see what I have done?
Will you still kiss me the same when you taste my victim's blood?
So crimson and red, I feel it flowing from your lips



All those things that you couldn't say
You should've said
All those I-love-you's lost
Weighed more like lead on your chest



All the while I'm doing my best
Not to rub my love against your head
I'd redecorate the walls with your inner thoughts
But I'm afraid it's the wrong shade of red
But I have these sadistic urges
And I don't want to take it out on you



Every kiss I could give to you
I'm holding your heart in my hand
The reason it still beats



Love kills, romance is dead
And I don't even trust myself
But I love you
And you can pull my wings apart
And pin me down under glass
Until the end of days if it can help you
Discover that we share the same pain


Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your games
You give love a bad name"

"event","The way i feel changes everyday. either im madly in love or i just like him. but damn it if i dont fall for him again everytime i start talking to him, and when i do talk to him i wonder will it ever work out for me and i get the boy or will we just be friends i dont know if i could just handle that.. and everyday getting reminded of the girlfriend, that kills me.. because he will be here in a couple days and i long for it to be me that he wants.. and then again everytime i think of him being here i get scared to death. because i think he has an image of what i should be and i dont want to let him down, i've told him many times that im not that really cute skinny scene girl and that pictures are very deseving, i dont him to be dissappointed, and i hope he realizes that im half the size i used to be over the summer and i haven't given up yet im losing more and more every day... i hope he doesn't get dissappointed while he's here and then be like ""oh she's not want i expected"" and then what we have so great is all gone. even if he still talks to me after he leaves i bet it wont be the same i bet he's not going to treat me the same, i hope its all in my imagination and i hope he's not like alot of the other guys. because thats what happened, we talk for a long time we hang out for the day and we never talk again. i will be very heartbroken if that happens because i never loved anyone that  i hung out with then never talked to again, and i dont with all im worth want that to happen. i want him to look past that and still be like ""i love my ally bear"" and still want me because im the same person that he talks to everynight and day and it could be worse i could still be that almost 300lb blonde haired girl that used to be shy and quiet. but im not her anymore.. im half that size and im still going i work out every day i go jogging i try.. i dont get called fat and stuff anymore but still i still see myself as that fat girl in the corner and i get very scared that people expecially guys wont like me because of  that. and im not going to lie im kinda shallow myself. i have some standards and i dont want to date some really fat kid... and i understand why no one wanted me then because its not appealing and i desided to do something about it. now i hope that this boy, my lovely zack, can be the amazing person the dream come true that he has been so far and stay that way after he see's me... im seriously not going to know what to do when he first gets here, because i've never been shy around new people until now because i do have feelings for him, and those feelings are strong and that makes me very shy, im glad i have someone like seth that will be here holding my hand until i get used to him. i can't wait to go to this concert and spend the weekend with zack, i can't wait untill im his, i can't wait for everything to work out. and i hope when he gets here he doesn't change his mind about wanting to come see me in march, and i want to see him sometime over the summer. the girlfriend thing kills me but he assures me that i'll be his soon, man i hope so, i really do...i want this weekend with him to be perfect, i want everything to be the way it has been and if it does he will own my entire heart and soul, not that he doesn't already but i will trust him even more then i do now and he will be that dream come true that i've longed for for so long.. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3"

"event","If theres one thing i can't have, i want. If theres one thing thats available, i dont want. The one thing i adore so greatly, its out of reach. Theres nothing more painful then sitting back knowing you've let your self go this time, and not being able to help it. There are times where i try to get it out of my head, for just a minute. But as soon as i hear, that one word, that one sound, or i see that one movement, smell that one smell, it all comes back to me and makes me realize how bad i want what i can't have. To many times has this happened to me. I shut my self up for so long, and pushed everyone/everything out. Now that i have let my self come out and touch what i've wanted to feel for a long time, i enjoy every minute of it. i just hate the feeling knowing that when i touch, smell, feel, love, that thing. i will know its still out of reach. thats probably my only down fall. i just wish i could express myself more to this, or even find something just as amazing as it to take its place, but i can't. so i will sit and wait an etirnity, just to be able to be with, to have, to feel, this one thing. even if my fairy tale doesn't come true, i had an amazing time dreaming it, and waiting for it, even if i did have little chunks of me broken in the time being. and i love it.

 

i miss my best friend, there is nothing i want more then to be able to just sit and be with jessyka, she is my world, she made me who i am today, she built me and loved me when i was that fat girl that everyone knew but didn't really hang out with, she makes me feel as if i am really loved, she is my family, and i know she will always be there when i really need her. she is my rock, my foundation, if anything ever happened to her i would die, i wouldn't be able to hold on with out her, she has been my journal, my notebook, my best friend. i could never ask for anything as great as jess. she means so much to me as a friend. i hate that she and i had to move, but the fact that we have stayed best friends thro the hard times and the good times. is amazing. i was there for her when she needed me and she was there for me when i needed her. the fact that i know i have someone who cares about me and really cares about me no matter what i do, what i look like, what happens to me. and i am the same with her. jessyka you are my best friend i miss you so much and i can't wait to see you. its been long enough since i've seen you and im ready for you to come back. i love you jessica!

 

Christina and Shelley have been amazing ho's, i really thing my freshman year would have sucked with out them. i wish i never had to move away from either of them. they have also been there thro alot. all the boys. all the drama. all the everything. they are still there for me. we are the terrific trio. theres nothing that could break us apart. i love you girls

 

my seth has been there since i've moved here to myrtle beach. he has made my life so much more fun. i absolutly adore this boy and i dont know what i would do with out him. i sometimes feel lost when he's not over. i feel like theres nothing to do. if i didn't have him to keep me sane thro everything. i would have gone mental a while ago. i lvoe you sethinator.

 

Brian and Crystal. wow i can't say how awesome these two are. they have come every weekend (almost) since my birthday, crystal has been one of the coolest chicks i've ever met, brians been one of the greatest guys i've ever met. they have been come my most favorite weekend people ever, my weekends haven't been lame since i've started talking to these crazy cats. i love you guys.

my mom has been great. we fight like cats and dogs alot, and no matter how much i claim to hate her sometimes, it hurts me to say that. i've been thro so much with that woman, we've stuck it out thro the hard times and the easy times. i've been there for her and she's been there for me. its our jobs to annoy each other, and sometimes i just wish i could be a better daughter. but im not. i try really hard to please her but lately i haven't been doing a great job at that. i've let my grades slip and i haven't been doing anything she asks me too. i appologize to her and i love her so much. mom i know i dont say this enough. but I love You.

 

my dad and my step mom are great. i haven't seen them alot lately and i absolutly love them. my dad has been the greatest thing, my step monster has to. they both have been there for me also, but i still think my mom takes the cake. i couldn't have made it thro anything with out my dad, my step mom and my mom. im a lucky child to have all my parents get along and be such great friends. me, my father and my step mom have been thro alot in this last year. from things that happened between us three, to my brother getting really cancer, we've all had to stay strong and just move on to the present and not live in the past. I love my dad and step mom to death.

 

i just want to let everyone know i love them. 

jessyka, christina, shelley, seth, steph, brian, crystal, zack, my family, exspecially jakey, my 2nd period crew, my people back home in wilmington, and everyone in between.

 

thanks everyone for being there for me and being such great friends. i absolutly admire all of you and i dont say it enough but you guys are the best."

i'm running away to live inside a rock... not under it our beside it or in the shade of a rock but inside it because if i lived inside the rock it would be harder to find me and if there are no doors or windows it would be dark but youd never know i was there and the only people allowed to come visit me are .... JESSYKA, DEREK, BUD thats it... i'm over the rest of the world and its all me know... i kno that sounds mean or selfish or what ever.... but i just cant take it anymore!!!!

ok well i'm flippin sad and Bud's coming to get me in a little bit.... 
God i love my Buddy!!!!

Then @ practice I realized that the team I am swimming with now is all leaving next year.  This weekend is my last meet with them, i dunno its kinda depressing. That was mainly my day.  Not to mention the practice tonight really sucked! It rained so now i feel totaly unpreparred for this weeknd..::sigh:: we'll see what happens.

"event","I had a lot of fun today too! First I woke up and then came online and talk to matt for a while!!!! =) Then i ate breakfast and started to clean my room and all that stuff for the summer. Then I took a shower and got dressed cuz my gramsie took me and Adam to see ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith""..I LOVED it!! After the movie we walked to Joanns to get some stuff for this board I'm gonna make! From the bar-mitzvah yesturday he was my last friend from hebrew school to have his bar-mitzvah so it was like my last time to see everyone because no one is comming back next year. Thinking about it really made me said and stuff so I asked matt this mornin if he thought we'd ever see eachother again if he didn't go to hebrew school next year and he said ""I'll find a way don't worry"" that made me feel really good like maybe its not the end but i hope he means it! xoxo

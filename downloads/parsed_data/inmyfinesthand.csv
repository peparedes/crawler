Yes folks, I have more than enough yarn for all of these projects.  So why then am I so damn tempted to head out Right This Second and buy 11 balls of Felted Tweed or Silky Wool to cast on for the Tangled Yoke Cardigan out of the latest Interweave?"

It doesn't look so bad, until you consider I bought 7 skeins of each colorway.  Yeah.

That's a massive quantity of yarn, I know.

But it was 70% off! 

The Wild Cherry and Durango are destined to be combined into <a href=""http://www.zephyrstyle.com/catalog/item.cfm/2367447/3974522"">Wicked</a>.  (Pink trim and pocket, grey body.)

The Bluezzzz is going to become something for my sister, but don't ask me what yet.

The Copper's destined for <a href=""http://knitandtonic.typepad.com/knitandtonic/2006/07/sizzle.html"">Sizzle</a> as I've decided that I'd rather use <lj-cut text=""This"">

for another <a href=""http://www.magknits.com/Aug05/picovoli.htm"">Picovoli</a>.

As for the Forest, I have no clue what I want to do with it, but the green's a really nice, soft color (the color in the picture's not quite right), and it wouldn't let me say no to it.  I tried, really I did.

Of course, all of these lovely plans are on hold until I finish the bloody <lj-cut text=""Doctor Who Scarf"">

Three hundred and twenty rows left until I can bind off, block, and add fringe.  I managed about 100 rows while waiting for the new Harry Potter book tonight, and the first day I was working on it I knit something insane like 300 or 400 rows.  I may end up putting in a DVD and finishing it off today.  Someone please remind me why, exactly, I wanted to knit a 12 foot long garter scarf in sport weight yarn?  Because I can't figure that one out."

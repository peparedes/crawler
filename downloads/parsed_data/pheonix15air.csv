"event","I went to visit Elijah's grave site today. The first time is the hardest. I cried. i cried hard. And then........... I was alright. I was able to remember him as he was, rather than the bad times. After I felt like I should go by the church........ Like Elijah wanted me to. So I did. I went, and I met the nicest woman. I talked to her a bit, and got to see Harry's house/room. It was horrible. I'm gonna get him a maid, I swear. But I felt whole. I felt like I could smile and not feel sad. It was a good feeling. I think I am finally getting a handle back on my life. Just, bit by bit. Things shall become better, I can feel it. Life is going to be very interesting indeed. Oh, and my trip to Venezuela shall be the best thing ever. I want to go so badly, and I'm almost there!!! Soon I shall be in another country, and I hope I have loads of fun. I'm sure I shall, considering I am going with some very attractive people, some of whom are QUITE free with themselves. Oh, life is a ball."

"event","Yeah, I haven't posted in like, a million years. Well, I wish I could find the second season of Avatar on sale somewhere, because I can't complete my DVD collection without it. I've got the first season, and I've got the first 4 seasons of Digimon, and I've got a few of the first seasons of Tenchi Muyo, and I've got all of the aired (and un-aired) episodes of Yami No Matsuei, and I've got a bunch of the manga, but I'm missing that ONE SEASON! Whatever. I shall find it. And you know, if I don't find it, that's alright. I'll just buy an emerald version."

"event","I can't get over what she did to me. She kicks me out for not wanting to be her slave. She takes Juliette's side over mine. She lies to me. Continually. Apparently I'm not smart enough to figure it out. I don't know why she thinks she can do this to me. She doesn't care about me, and I should have known it. I can't believe she hurt me this badly. She gets rid of me because I forget to take out the trash! She lies about me to my friends. She tells them I hang out at a gay bar, that I tried to strangle our dog, that I did drugs. I don't do any of these things. And my friends knew. They told me they knew she was lying. I can't understand what I can do now.&nbsp; She has all of my belongings, she won't answer my calls. She broke my heart. I don't know anyone here. I feel awkward and unwanted. I miss my friends, and then remember that I can't go back. I'm hurt, and I don't know how to fix it. I just feel so lost."

"event","<font color=""#003300""><font size=""3"">Well, it has been a while since I posted, hasn't it? Well, nothing much has happened. I got up and walked to the library because I had just remembered that I needed to turn in a book. Well, they have computers too, and, there were some empty ones. I keep having the recurring dream where my head gets bitten&nbsp; off by an ant. This is extremely strange, and I am wondering whether I may be going even crazier than I already am, if such a thing is possible. but it only lasts for a few minutes, so it's just annoying, not scary. I forgot my mother's birthday, but it's okay because I'm too far away from her for her to be that angry. there are a multitude of excuses I could use, and I intend to employ one of them.</font></font>"

"event","Wow. Not too long ago I was bereft to sadness and depression, and I look back now and think, Loser! I have no idea why I was in the turmiol zone, but I'm glad I'm through that. I don't even think about missing 'The Group' back in N.C. anymore. I'm starting again. And this should be interesting...."

"event","Wow, I went to register for school today. It took forever. There are things that you have to do that are just ridiculous. I swear, it was like hazing almost! I see no reason to do such things. But hey, I'm not in charge. I hope school is as exciting and great as my sister keeps saying, 'cause it would really suck if it wasn't."

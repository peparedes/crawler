the first person i saw was rashad, which was kind of random but cool.
and then dana and shawn. and then megan.
i got tanner. and i swam with dolphins. and the water in florida smells weird.
i need to go see ace next weekend.
but unless rashad got me a ticket tonight, at the moment, i don't have one.
i also don't have a ride home.
work tonight was kind of not fun.
the people were really messy, some guy told me he was going to cut off my hand, and no tip.
my leg hurts.
i didn't have to see lexi for eight days.
it was awesome.&nbsp;

"event","<p>to all my fans, i know it may seem that i have abandoned my duties of writing about my hatred for lexi, but i have not. not at all. school has been okay lately. nothing special. today was surprisingly easy. review day in calc, destinos in spanish, nothing much in biology, and amex doesn't even count. all we did at track were stairs and sprints in the back hallway. also easy. i don't know why, but for the past few days i've been really pissed off and i don't know what. probably mostly lexi. but i'm assuming it's also a combination of an extreme lack of sleep, homework, and ridiculous track practices. on our first day of practice we did a 5.5 mile distance run. second day, 16 400s. third day, 5 mile distance run. fourth day, 6 800s. i was only there for four of them though. but still, even four is a good workout. but seriously, for&nbsp;the first week of practice...it's ridiculous. i blame it all on lexi.&nbsp;<br />anyway. silverstein was a few weeks ago. it was pretty awesome. i went with dana, carrie, and bobbi and we saw eric, kyle, and two other kids that go to ridley that i don't know. but whatever. it was pretty intense for protest the hero and a day to remember. then for the devil wears prada it was completely insane. after their set was over, we went in the back to find carrie because she had gotten pushed back. then during silverstein, me and dana went in the back where all the pits were. it was actually really fun.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><font size=""2"">What did you wear today? <br />school clothes, track clothes, normal clothes, pajamas. <br /><br />Are you currently taking any science class in school? <br />ap biology. heck yes!<br /><br />Where is your cell phone? <br />in frint of me.<br /><br />What is the most played song on your music player? <br />act appalled-circa survive...but my music just got completely erased and i had to put everything back on so this is just what i've been listening to the most recently. if that makes any sense at all.<br /><br />What was the last thing you had to eat? <br />pizza.<br /><br />What does your hair look like?&nbsp;<br />brown, in a messy bun, party time.<br /><br />What was the last compliment you received? <br />uh...that&nbsp;i'm funny? i don't remember.<br /><br />Would you ever donate blood? <br />possibly.<br /><br />How many people are currently online your AIM list?<br />50.<br /><br />What was the last television show you watched? <br />mxc!<br /><br />What was the last movie you watched? <br />i was just watching the fog. it's so horrible it's funny. <br /><br />Are you craving anything right now? <br />water. or orange juice.<br /><br />Do you think that you're attractive? <br />sure. <br /><br />Do you have Myspace? If so, what is your URL? <br />yes. shut up.</font><br /><br /><br /><font size=""2"">How many friends do you have on Myspace? <br />388.<br /><br />Do you prefer white meat or dark meat?&nbsp;<br />white meat i guess.<br /><br />What was the last thing you thought was funny? <br />the fog.<br /><br />What did the last shoes you wore look like? <br />gray and pink and white. <br /><br />Do you label people? <br />only when mocking them.<br /><br />Do you have/want any piercings or tattoos? <br />i have some piercings. i might want some more. who knows? not me.<br /><br />What would be your choice of weapon, if you had to choose? <br />definitely a machete. unless it's a zombie attack. then it would be marbles.<br /><br />Do you ever make fun of other peoples survey answers? <br />probably.<br /><br />Has anyone ever made fun of your answers? <br />i don't really take them much. but probably.<br /><br />What do you currently hear? <br />and i told them i invented times new roman-dance gavin dance, tv, dryer, typing. <br /><br />Do you have a favorite quote? <br />not one that i can think of right now.<br /><br />Do you have an occupation? <br />hellz yes.<br /><br />Who do you think is the sexiest person alive? <br />um...there's a few. <br /><br />When was the last time you took a picture of yourself? <br />uh, last saturday? who cares?<br /><br />Would you move, if given the chance? If so, where? If not, why? <br />to australia maybe. or europe. someplace that's not about to get blown up.<br /><br />What was the last thing you felt bad about? <br />life. not really. i don't know. being a bitch.<br /><br />Do you like rap music? <br />no, not really.<br /><br />Is there anyone you would like to fight? <br />not fight...<br /><br />How much money do you have on you? <br />absolutely none!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />anyway. tonight was weird. we watched wkuk tonight. funny stuff. it's a shame so many people missed it. dude. freaking. unnecessary. okay? like why? i don't have too much homework this weekend. and i already finished my calc outline! but not bio. i didn't even bring that home. i've recently realized that i'm probably going to get a * on both of the ap exams. and yes, that is lower than a 1. i can't wait until may 13th. ap calc, ap bio, and track will all be over. and i will be happy.&nbsp;i love how i'm so eager for track to end and it's only a week into the season. whatever. i really need&nbsp;a break. work tomorrow at one. whoo! hopefully it won't be long. i'm kind of tired of writing. i'm out. lexi, i hate you.</font></p>"

&nbsp;one of my cousins' friend's dad died in a car crash last night. it's so sad and kind of scary too. things like that really show you how short life is and how everything can change so quickly.&nbsp;

"event","lexi, dana, ashley,&nbsp;bobbi, and i&nbsp;went to see chiodos on sunday. they played with the devil wears prada, scary kids scaring kids, and emery. and this random opener. i think they were called trophy stars. i wasn't a big fan of them but the drummer seemed pretty&nbsp; good looking from semi far away. by the time we got there it was pretty full, so we just decided to stay back on the step part since we could see pretty well there. the devil wears prada was good. almost every one in that band was attractive, too. scary kids scaring kids was awesome. emery was alright but we didn't know them that well so when they came on we went in the back to buy merch and we got to meet pouyan! we got a picture with him...but dana blinked. and i gave him a hug. we almost met tyson twice but each time just as we were about to go up to him, he left. the second time was after the show at wawa. he walked up and i was like ""hey"" and he kind of smiled at me. then he went inside for like two seconds, came out, and was surrounded. chiodos was amazing. craig owens....well, he just seems like a&nbsp;very sexual person. lexi decided that we should crowd surf during ""there's no penguins in alaska"". she made it to the front but they dropped bobbi and ashley and i kind of got thrown into the middle of the hardcore dancing pit. but it was okay because it actually didn't hurt and this kid who was pretty cute helped me up. halfway through the opening band we turned around and rick and jason were standing there. jason's pretty cool but rick's kind of creepy. after sunday i thought he was okay though. until he started like semi stalking bobbi. but in general, it was a fun night.&nbsp;

pretty much nothing else exciting happened this week. we got to wear jeans today and ridley won the game. we have one more game and if we win that, we go to states. maybe this means we'll get to wear jeans next friday too. sweet.

oh yeah. i hate the old librarian almost as much as i hate lexi. and let me tell you. that's a lot.

i'm going to go watch disturbia now. oh. i finally saw psycho. it's so good. go watch it."

i'm&nbsp;tired, as usual. cross country's over. it's sad&nbsp;but nice too. i think stan thinks i'm&nbsp;doing winter track. hah. no. districts was fun on friday. i dropped like thirty seconds off of my time. we played ultimate frisbee in the rain. i think that made&nbsp;me sick but whatever. i had&nbsp;work on saturday. it wasn't too bad. i have it again on sunday. whoo. i hate homework. so much.&nbsp;halloween's tomorrow.&nbsp;"

"event","dude i am tired. psats were today and they were a total party. and my last meet at rose tree for the year was today. i can't believe i only have one more year of running there. after all the races we went back into the woods and found our tree and all the seniors carved their initials into it. that'll be us next year. weird. we didn't win the&nbsp;sportsmanship award even though we totally should have. i mean lower merion won it. that was the meet that started two hours late and they made us&nbsp;all run together which sucked. lexi's movie party is now but i'm not going until later because emily's birthday party is also now even though only like four people are here at the moment. i need to do a lot of homework and write an essay and figure out what we're doing in calc. tomorrow should be fun. but not really. i wish i was down the shore right now with some cool people. unfortunately, i'm not."

"event","<p>i did pretty bad in my workout today. i really don't know why though. it shouldn't have been that hard and i wasn't really tired. i just couldn't do it. i was six seconds under on my last 400 after running&nbsp;three and three quarters miles and i didn't think that was hard and it didn't feel like i was going any faster than i had been before. i don't know what was wrong with me.&nbsp;nine more days.&nbsp;<br /><br />i have a calc test the day of districts. that sucks. a lot. i still don't know any bio. but we have a half day tomorrow so hopefully, somehow, i will learn it all then...which i doubt i will. we started reading the adventures of&nbsp;huckleberry finn today. even though we're not done everything with the scarlet letter. it's actually pretty good. me and dana read a chapter and a half out loud in accents and it was funny. which is a surprise. you know who isn't funny? lexi. yesterday i was trying to get her to do winter track, but she kept saying no. i'm not doing it. i just wanted her to do it so it could inflict high amounts of pain on her. </p>"

"event","this weekend was alright. friday i went to gap then lexi's house. saturday i went to lexi's and shawn made friends with the little kid next door while he was skateboarding. sunday we had a cyo meeting and we ate ice cream. there are some people there who are really annoying. then me and dana and meghan and lexi&nbsp;had a homework party at my house. then eryn and michelle and cindy and bill came over so we stopped. eventually,&nbsp;everyone left except for lexi. she refused to leave and she slept over. i didn't even ask her to stay. she just did. she's so annoying and i hate her so much. why would i want to have a sleepover with someone who i hate. and she made us listen to bullet for my valentine while we were falling asleep. it was horrible. she left at like 12:30 today so, luckily, i didn't have to spend all day with her. i was going to get my permit this weekend but the&nbsp;place was closed for colombus day. that was actually probably lexi's fault. so next weekend...hopefully.

&nbsp;homework sucks. school sucks. i'm really glad we had off today. if we didn't there would be no way i would've gotten all of my homework done. 

only 2/3 weeks of cross country left! 

would you not give up and not lay down until i'm found?"

"event","&nbsp;i am extremely tired. school sucks. lexi sucks. they've been giving us a ridiculous amount of homework lately. it's the scarlet letter's fault.&nbsp; do we really need to read like 25 chapters a night? no. i have no idea what's going on in calc at the moment. which isn't good. and i've only been getting like six hours of sleep if i'm lucky. i fell asleep like four times in calc today. that's probably why i don't know what we're doing. but even the people who stayed awake don't know what they're doing. so i don't know. i can't wait until cross country is over, only because i'll have like an extra two and a half hours to do homework and sleep. which should be pretty amazing. people are so weird. like...why?"

"event","no cross country this weekend! yesssss. last night i went to the football game with eryn, dana, carrie, and amanda. i was going to work the snackbar because if you work all four homegames you get a free prom ticket but i don't know if i can make all the games so i didn't do it. it was pretty fun. ridley won 19-3 against penncrest. there was a middle school fight that bob got pulled into. and penncrest had a male cheerleader! he was adorable. i think the best part was that lexi worked the snackbar all night and i didn't have to hang out with her at all. after the game me, dana, carrie, eryn, meghan, michelle, bob, mike, and rashad walked to lexi's house without lexi because we had no idea where she was. but apparently she was a block behind us the whole time with shawn. which just kept her away from me longer so i didn't care. my computer is being really annoying and it looks like i'm typing in slow motion so i'm leaving. bye.&nbsp;

"event","<p>last night was the scary kids scaring kids show at the tla. they played with boys night out, pierce the veil, and damiera. i went with dana, eryn, lexi, rob, and rashad and&nbsp;rashad couldn't bring his camera in. hah.&nbsp;it was a good show but the microphone wasn't turned up loud enough so you couldn't hear them the whole time.&nbsp;it wasn't too bad crowd-wise either. there wasn't too much pushing.&nbsp;i was in about the third row for damiera and pierce the veil and got up to the second for boys night out and sksk.&nbsp;it was alot of fun. pouyan was going insane.&nbsp;he was beating his chest like he was freaking tarzan or something and he took off his shirt and threw it somewhere and at one point his pants were falling down. i think he was slightly intoxicated though. and i think tyson was too because he threw up during the second to last song.&nbsp;it was over really early. we met the bassist from damiera who was quite attractive and really nice&nbsp;and we got him to sign some stuff and gave us all hugs and then he introduced us to two of the other guys in the band who also signed stuff. then we met the bassist from pierce the veil. he was pretty cool and he had some crazy hair.&nbsp;then i got a shirt and dana got the new cd which is quite good by the way and we walked down the street to jim's steaks and sat there for a while. and i bought a soda and the guy who was working there was like amazed that i didn't order a steak. he was like ""you ain't got no steak?"" and i was like ""...no.""&nbsp;then eryn's dad picked us up. then we went home. then i went to bed. unfortunately, we had school today but i guess it was a good way to end the summer. the only problem with last night was the fact that lexi, aka asshole,&nbsp;was with us the entire time and even though we tried to leave without her, it didn't work.<br /><br />today was the first day of school and i hate it already. i have ap calc, seminar, ap bio, and amex and they screwed up my schedule. they switched bio and seminar so i had bio second block and seminar third so next semester instead of seminar i would have had forensics instead of spanish 3 because they don't run spanish 3 third block. so i talked to mrs butler and i was going to either be taking forensics or sociology but then she talked to mr mccusker and he said i could swith into third block bio even though the class already had too many kids because he's a cool guy. so now my schedule isn't messed up anymore and i have spanish 3. if i didn't have it this year it would have screwed up my whole senior year schedule too. it was all miss corollostupid's fault. she was the counsler who stood in for butler when she had her baby and she messed up everyone's schedules and ruined everyone's lives. thanks alot. but anyway.&nbsp;i have homework and it's only the first day. and it wasn't even a full day. the only problem with my schedule now is that i think&nbsp;lexi is in every single one of my classes. i am going to kill myself. or her.&nbsp;<br /><br />i might get matt to take my ticket for boys like girls. then i can go to chiodos instead. and then there's underoath...i hope only cool people end up going to these. meaning NOT LEXI.<br /><br /></p>"

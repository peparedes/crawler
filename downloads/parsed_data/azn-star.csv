"event","SOoooo THis morning .. the announcements announce that we are having hot pockets today, of which is my favorite food out of all the other school foods.. so until lunch i was very very very very happy.. we hardly ever have them, you see...and i am never happy during the mornings .. but today i was..because we were having hot pockets... so i get in line at lunch.. yes..a very long line it is.. and then i finally get to the part of getting my food.......the person in front of me gets the last hot pocket..and youd think they go get some more out of the oven or whatever..and give them to me..but no..guess what they tell me.. ""we ran out you'll have to go get in hte toher line or something"" ..and i stood there and stared at them for a minute.. i was in shock.. and then brittany and ryan went to get in the other line.. well i didnt. i didnt want to. i refused to.  because they refuse to give me my hot pocket. they want me to starve..yes.. yes they do..they dont want me to eat.. so i wont eat. cause my school is nothing but a torture chamber.. i am a prisoner in there.. and they dont feed prisoners because we could care less to them.. -.- .... i  would have cried, actually..but no..i hid my emotions and pretended to be happy.. after sitting a moment at our table staring..i think, next time, when they run out of food again, that i shall refuse to leave until they give me my food. i will sit there and demand they give it to me. if they don't then ill just keep sitting there until they do. its ridiculous..they should have enough food for studentS! WE CANT LEARN IF WE DONT EAT!.. well thats not true.. -_-;..cause i had a test after lunch and i didnt eat anything and i made a 92..yes..i missed 2 problems! ..*nods* ..but eh! who knows! i might have made a hundred if they had fed me!!.. =| 

Im just going to go now.. i think i get to go to BAM.. *shrugs* .. im going to go somewhere though....byebyez.."

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/N/nekokittychi/1075175161_uizzesRain.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Rain""><br>Your element is Rain: Sad, lonely, distant and<br>unique. You are quite distant from emotion and<br>people, but you have been made this way by one<br>thing or another. You are truly unique yet fail<br>to see it, and are quite creative be it in art,<br>music, writing, ect.. You used to let people in<br>now you don't even bother to try having been<br>hurt so many times in the past. Your attitude<br>is that you don't need anyone but yourself,<br>people are just trouble waiting to happen. But<br>you really do want to trust someone no matter<br>if you see it or not, deep down your waiting<br>for someone to come and set you free. This kind<br>of depression can turn dangerous, don't let<br>them get to you. Not everyone in the world will<br>hurt you, humans are humans and are not<br>perfect. So most likely sooner or later you'll<br>meet someone who feels like you do and perhaps<br>your shell will eventually disappear.

Well well well, the old fashioned 17th century<br>vampire, one of my faves. You look for the good<br>things in life, you posses a lot of classical<br>class, and follow that of the original<br>vampires, you have no shame in what you are,<br>infact you embrace it, you love it and wouldn't<br>have it any other way. Your wealth is<br>unspeakable and your way of luring people with<br>your mystical ways and looks is amazing, and<br>most people would often call you The<br>Seductress. Please rate this quiz!

You are night, you are dark and mysterious, you<br>have more than likly been through some kind of<br>truma, depression. you have a creative mind,<br>and more than likly find peace enjoyment in<br>drawing, painting, writing. You are closed and<br>hidden away from people, and hide you emotions<br>behind a wall which you use on people. Try to<br>become more open, spread your creativity, you<br>have no idea of how many people there are out<br>there like you, exposing your art and yourself<br>can make other people come out, so many people<br>would look up to your for your courage and your<br>spirit, your not evil or bad, just<br>missunderstood, so get out there and show them<br>just what you are made of, don't worry about<br>what other people think, it's what you think<br>that really matters.

<i>""And The Phoenix's cycle had reached<br>zenith, so he consumed himself in fire.  He<br>emerged from his own ashes, to be forever<br>immortal.""</i>

Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl<br>(Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum<br>(Egyptian).
The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life,<br>the number 0, and the element of fire.
His sign is the eclipsed sun.

As a member of Form 0, you are a determined<br>individual.  You tend to keep your sense of<br>optomism, even through tough times and have a<br>positive outlook on most situations.  You have<br>a way of looking at going through life as a<br>journey that you can constantly learn from.<br>Phoenixes are the best friends to have because<br>they cheer people up easily.

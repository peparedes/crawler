"event","<P>So today was relativley reasonable.&nbsp; Classes were interesting not too much stressing over finals and stuff but i have a feeling by thursday i will be freaking out.&nbsp; This weekend i got my promotion dress.&nbsp; its pretty i guess but i still need shoes.</P>
<P>K so in Dance i was very frustrated. Some people were being very mean and bitchy to a girl who is really nice.&nbsp; She did not deserve it at all they(you know who u are) really need to stop.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Then Lunch was fun.&nbsp; We had a debate over whether or not Lindsay Lohan has had a boob job.&nbsp; Personally i dont think she has.&nbsp; So if you have an opinion please let me know, but dont tell me you saw it in US magazine (katie) because its just a tabloid.&nbsp; </P>
<P>have to start my homework.&nbsp; <FONT color=#ff0000>werd&nbsp; </FONT></P>"

First in science i got a 108% how awesome is that?!!  
Latin- boring as HELL!!!!!! bout to fall asleep and i swear if mr. ingram licks his lips one more time im gonna scream!!
Dance- very very interesting. i found out ms. culberson is a princess like a real princess of some country in South Africa!
Math- bleh
AS- i was sitting at my desk with my hands over my face cause i was so nervous about getting my Twiz back and MR C's like ""what are u doing"" in this really mean way that really scared me ""you got a 100%"" i wanted to scream!!
English- boring. missed my bud Katie. how skinny is clare danes though?  aahh i could not stop staring at her MASSIVE chin. she's this skinny girl with a narrow face with a giant potruding chin.  not very attractive
PE- i had to play Mr. Willens- i lost but it was a good match. hes not bad people, he's really athletic and like a pro paddle tennis player

"event","K so today was boring.  Shocker i know.

It was sooo cold.  It feels like winter, i mean we all only have to weeks left of school where is all the summer sun?

So my classes were dull except A.S. there is always action in there.  Jenny and are sitting in our corner steaming. she's arguing with him and im just sitting there so mad i cant speak. I Hate Mr. C, he such a freaking idiot.   ""I'm not gonna take any side or let my pesonal feelings show but.... Bush is an idiot.  He's a lying, stupid, cheater.  Im sorry i promise i wont share my personal feelings anymore."" ya right! next day we go through the same routine, he even makes the liberals mad (mandy lol).  i wish i had mr. becker.  

english- boring i almost fell asleep in that movie. i dont like it but leo's a cutie

well gotta go to hw- bleh"

Holy crap, the process to get Sudafed in Washington state is very nearly similar to getting on a freaking airplane. In fact, it's a smidge more invasive. Aside from that naked thing.

Can't pick it up at the drive through, once you come inside you get your ID scanned and they copy down all your information, then you have to electronically sign a thing that says you can be arrested/fined/jailed/executed for not following your doctor's directions.

I'm just curious - I would think that alcohol and drunk driving causes more deaths than sudafed/meth use. Why don't we do this with alcohol sales?"

By muting the TV and sitting in another chair away from the remote, I managed to unfortunately experience ""Two and a half Men"". At least with the sound off, I haven't wanted to stab myself for the entire thing, only when I saw Charlie Sheen wearing cargo shorts and loafers with his waxed legs. That show is much more blatant with product placement than I expected it to be. The half-man did an Apple FaceTime call to Charlie Sheen's iPhone 4, and later in the episode they were at a pharmacy that had a very prominent Sharp cash register in the foreground of many of the shots.

The Call of Duty commercial almost makes me want an XBox. Unfortunately I know how bad I am at first-persona shooters.

Why is it that my 6 year old PowerBook G4 can open an Excel spreadsheet using Apple Mail ""Quick Look"" in about two seconds, but when I go to open the spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel it takes about five minutes?"

"event","Wow... did not plan on staying out this late. Evan had a gig in Stevenson, WA, and I wanted to at least get an idea of how it was, but ended up staying for the whole thing. Whatever cold I'm coming down with is going to kick my ass tomorrow. But I had fun. The gig was for a non-profit that does stuff for the local schools out there to help keep the kids off the streets/drugs/pregnant/jail/dead/alcohol/swearing. It started off pretty slow, Evan got a little frustrated because the kids were not in to his standard fare. We ended up looking up the bestselling MP3s on Amazon and wrote them all down for him. We discovered that songs with 120+ beats/min are where it's at to get people on the dancefloor. Some of the kids had some incredible costumes, too, and at least two of them were high as a kite.

The drive back was a nightmare. We took the Washington side to avoid paying the toll at the Bridge of the Gods again, and I swear, the road signs brought back memories of Pee Wee's Big Adventure. Plus pouring rain.

In other news, Costco can refill my printer's ink cartridges for $10 each! I have one black and one color cartridge; this is much better than the $26.xx I found for a new black cartridge on Amazon."

"event","Inspired by <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/8301-19709_1-20021075-10.html"" target=""_blank"">this</a>, I'm going to blog a bit about my experiences with dropping my cable connection and switching to using nothing but a Roku box, a (cheap!) Windows 7 box, and an antenna.

A couple months ago I dropped my super expensive cable package for the most basic package they offered, and have been attempting to get decent reception from an antenna and supplementing my programming with Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon VOD on the Roku.

At first, I thought this would end up being significantly more expensive. However, after doing a big chunk of math, I realized that all the shows I was putting on my DVR were either available OTA (Over the Air) or on Hulu. So far, $0.00. The only shows that I was looking forward to watching from non-network channels were Mad Men, My Life on the D-List, and Futurama. All three of these shows were on Amazon for $1.99-$2.99 per episode, and a bit cheaper when subscribing to the season. Since these shows are billed once per week, that only puts the cost at $35.88 (sans tax) at most per month. On top of that, through Amazon these will play on the Roku boxes I have in the living room and the bedroom.

Compare that to $80 or so for my cable TV package. 

I seriously have not missed anything at all.

The next goal is to figure out the antenna situation. I currently pay a net of $3 per month for the basic cable package (the lower price of the internet bundle washes out the majority of the TV price), but I'd like to eliminate even this and be counted among the hundreds of thousands of TV subscribers Comcast has recently lost. I'm thinking the solution is going to be mounting a big antenna in the attic."

"event","So this is the second >2 day weekend I've had in a row, if you count last weekend's laying on the couch trying not to drown or suffocate from the effects of a sinus infection as a weekend.

Yesterday I woke up and laid around then went to Warren, OR for the t-day. Mom, step-dad, and I had prime rib at step-dad's sister and brother-in-law's house. I was the youngest there. It was kinda nice being around not my full family and feeling the heat of their judgement or stupidity/trashiness. Didn't do anything last night.

Today I woke up and tried to keep myself motivated to glue down the little plastic rails that hold the transition pieces for my flooring between rooms/floor types. Although it isn't hard work, the glue I bought takes 24 hours to fully set, and if it's off by so much as a millimeter it leaves a gap, so it's kinda stressful. I think I may have a system down now that I've fully destroyed one piece and then failed on another. I guess we'll find out tomorrow though, won't we?

Had to make a home depot trip for some more concrete patch, this time of the pre-mixed variety. It's more expensive, but holy cow so much less frustrating than having to mix your own and then try to use it all before it dries up. Basically wherever there was a tacking strip for the carpet a bunch of divots in the concrete subfloor remain. These divots have to be filled so there is something level to glue the rail down to and properly support the flooring underneath.

Anyway. Now I guess I'll spend the evening watching Netflix streaming. Boring."

The weekend has been good overall. Friday night I went out and shot arrows (well, watched) at coworker Phillip's house, then went to Tigard for dinner and a movie for Sister Amanda's birthday. We saw <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1225822/"">Extract</a>, which was overall a good movie... I think I'm a little confused about my feelings about it because it just told a story. Not a chick flick, no action, horror, drama...just storytelling. I wouldn't say storytelling at its finest, but good Netflix fodder IMO. Saturday Kate and Evan came up and hauled my old trim pieces and moldings, closet doors, and carpet to <a href=""http://www.pdxrestore.org/"">Habitat for Humanity ReStore</a> and to the dump. 

At the ReStore, they basically told me that they wouldn't take anything...but I called about 2 hours before we arrived to confirm that they'd take the closet doors and the trim and moulding. The majority of the carpet was either stained or just worn out, which disappointed them. Amusing thing was that the volunteer I spoke with on the phone radioed the coordinator who was helping us unload and took about as long to explain and ask how to indicate the wrong amount of change/charge/bills in the register as it did for me to wrench whether they'd take my bifold closet doors and moldings and trim pieces as donations over the phone.

...

Continued a zillion hours later...

...the new shades are up in two of three windows. Mismeasured the fabric so I need to get a bit more. But...they look amazing. What a change for this room, new flooring, new window coverings...the old blue ceiling fan has mostly disappeared.

Coming up this week: five days of work. Two of them will be from home while my heat pump gets installed. Sine the weather is supposed to continue being so fantastic, I should really give my car a thorough cleaning and its yearly wax job. And maybe sleep.

Yeah, that sounds good."

<strong>Friday</strong>
Crazy at work. Had to change desks. Then was let out early, cause when I finished up moving it was 4:30PM. Had my arm twisted in to going out for happy hour, we went to the Blackstone Grill, then had my arm further twisted into going to Charlie's, got kicked out (see previous post), came home and wrote many an angry review, then fell asleep.

<strong>Saturday</strong>
Woke up around 7:30AM, and opened the garage for the Best Buy guys to deliver my new washer and dryer. Discovered shortly after they left that they hooked up the hot water to the cold and the cold water to the hot. And that the washer seems to only be able to draw water out of one hose regardless of the temperature setting. <lj user=""like2travel""> arrived at 11:00AM. He and I pulled the carpet up, the tacking strips, and had nearly begun cleanup when <lj user=""twitbucket""> arrived just in time to drive us to Sonic for lunch. We took a quick trip to Home Depot to pick up a few things, then came back and really started cranking on cleaning up the floor and laying cement.

::quick side note:: watching IT Crowd on Comcast HD On Demand from IFC. To make it HD, they cut off the top and bottom bars. Really annoyed with that.

Anyway, after that went to a party at Momma Shawn's house. White trash party. Good time. Took my white trashy cream cheese + cocktail sauce + shrimp plate. Two annoying people. Amusing thing was that one of the annoying people passed out drunk into a glass bookshelf with nothing but liquor glasses on it.

<strong>Sunday</strong>
Laid floor like badasses. Of course, it took 1.5 hours to rip one board, thanks to a dead jig saw blade, Home Depot selling me a totally wrong set of jig saw blades, and going back to buying another blade.

<strong>Monday</strong>
Got the hallway finished to within a board of the existing flooring. Way too much math and physics and whatnot. I'm going to have to call Katie's brother to see if he can help with the last one. I also need to order transition pieces for between the different floors. Cleaned the sawdust in the garage, replaced furniture in the living room, replaced several electrical outlets, and took a shower.

Tomorrow will be back to work. Meh."

3315 NE 112th Ave
Vancouver, WA 98682
(360) 256-9991

I came to Charlie's tonight with coworkers. They decided to go there because a former coworker bartends there. Some of my coworkers were already there at the pool tables when I arrived around 6:00PM.

We discovered that our former coworker wasn't tending bar but was there playing pool. Even though it was early in the evening, there was a decent sized crowd and the bartenders were making every effort to be as quick and efficient as possible, keeping the line nice and short. The drinks were cheap (I paid $8.50 for two well drinks that were quite satisfying), the pool tables were cheap as well at $0.50, and the overall vibe wasn't so much a seedy dive bar as it was pool hall and sports bar. The crowd does change a bit as the evening carries on, seems a little bit more rowdy/rough (like a dive bar) and I was told that it's because there's live music at 9:00PM on the weekends. I unfortunately didn't get to stay for the DJ, not that I particularly wanted to, but...well, here's the story.

<lj-cut text=""Here's the part where I get 86ed."">After I cashed out my credit card at the bar, I had gone back to my stool near our pool table and was sipping a glass of water while my coworkers finished up what would be their final game. This was probably around 8:30PM (I'd look at the credit card receipt, but for some reason it shows 2:00AM tomorrow). A man who I later found out to be an off-duty doorman approached me and told me he needed to speak with me outside. I followed him out and he stated something along the lines of, ""I don't care whether you did this or not, but...I need to know if you stole a roll of quarters tonight.""

""No."" (WTF? And if you don't care, why are you bothering to ask? Plus you're not even working tonight!!!)

""Because we have a witness that says you did,"" he told me.

(WTFx2?)

I told him that I had gone to my car earlier in the evening to get some quarters for my coworkers and I to continue playing pool, and shortly after that one of the bartenders had walked by and asked if I had happened to pick up a roll of quarters (when that happened, she did say, ""I just sold them one,"" indicating the next table and she began looking around on the floor near me). In retrospect, I do remember a few minutes prior to her stopping by someone from the next table over said something about quarters.

I asked the off-duty doorman if he wanted me to empty my pockets.

""Nope.""

(WTF?) ""Okay?""

""And I'm not letting you back in.""

(WTF?) ""Okay?""

""So you're gonna call it a night for this place. If you have a problem with that, you can take it up with management tomorrow,"" he told me.

I said, ""Okay,"" and turned to go to my car. My coworkers started shuffling out just as soon as they could cash out their tabs.

Needless to say, I won't be going back. I'm really not certain why they wouldn't have called the police if they thought I was stealing from the bar or from other patrons. Obviously it had already been decided that I was getting kicked out since the doorman didn't frisk me or ask me to empty my pockets, and told me that he didn't care if I'd done it or not. Perhaps one of the regulars didn't like the way I looked at him or something (there were two guys that were more or less cradling each other as I walked passed to go to the restroom - I looked and smiled because you just don't see gays in Vancouver, and I sure as hell wouldn't ever PDA with another guy in this place).

Or maybe I'm just super paranoid about getting tied to a bumper and drug through town.

There's signage near the pool tables detailing rules for the pool table area and that you will be ""86""ed from the establishment for breaking those rules...antagonize somebody while they're trying to set up a shot, set a drink on the table, stab somebody with a stick, and all that happens is you can't come back? Sounds light to me. No mention of thievery though.

And seriously, quarters? I'm not 8, and this isn't the arcade. I paid - and left gratuity by calculating twice sales tax - with my American Express card. I sat at the table and didn't interact with anyone but my coworkers, my former coworker, and the staff all night. I only had two drinks over the course of 2 hours and drank a glass of water between them and then had two more after the last one, so I definitely was NOT drunk. I wasn't rude to anyone, and even when I realized that I was standing in the way of another man's shot while I was setting up my own I stepped away and made sure to apologize as I know nothing of pool hall etiquette. So unless I had some kind of a stroke, during which I took this alleged roll of quarters and ate them, then miraculously recovered from said stroke in time to finish my drink, pee, cash out my tab and ask for a refill on my water...

In the parking lot, my coworkers all apologized to me and we decided that the evening had been killed so we all went home. I called one of my friends and had a good laugh on the way.

I'll be sure to update this review if I hear some metallic clanging in the bowl tomorrow. </lj-cut>"

"event","I got the notice that I need to renew my tabs/registration on my car. I'm also required to get an emissions test done. I just had one done two years ago.

After checking up online a bit, I found out that odd-numbered model year 1985-1995 and even-numbered model year 1996-2004 vehicles must be emissions tested in 2009 to be renewed or registered in Washington state.

Why? I can see 1995 and older vehicles. Maybe 1999 and older. Most likely 1989. But 2004 and older??? Seriously, those cars probably still have some factory warranty left on them.

And isn't this part of the problem with people continuing to drive older cars? I know there's been some word as to providing a scrap/junker trade in, where you get up to a four digit credit against buying a new car for trading in an older, less-efficient vehicle. But instead of penalizing people who drive cars that aren't brand new but still relatively efficient, why not rejigger this policy to put the older, obviously less efficient, inclusive of pre-clean air act vehicles through this rigamarole?

Wouldn't that make a little more sense?

Cause little advertised fact: it's not just MPG that CAFE and CARB and the EPA look at, it's particulate emissions. A vehicle can have its particulate emissions stay the same when MPG increases or decreases, while simultaneously its MPG can stay the same while emissions increase. Put a more efficient air conditioner, power steering pump, alternator on a vehicle, suddenly particulate emissions go down while MPG ends up staying the same.

Regurgitated from radio.

Went out and got thai food since I'm feeling better today. Ate it at the coffee table.

I think I need to figure out if I need to wax it or something now. If it's solid pine with an oil-based stain, what type of conditioning....something should I use?"

I guess she could've also said, ""hope you stop smelling!"" Or made a better product recommendation."

</span></span></p><p> </p>
<p> </p>
Ingrids have sensitive feelings and are warm and perceptive.
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>How to Get Along with Me</strong> 
<ul>
<li>* Give me plenty of compliments. They mean a lot to me.</li>
<li>* Be a supportive friend or partner. Help me to learn to love and value myself.</li>
<li>* Respect me for my special gifts of intuition and vision.</li>
<li>* Though I don't always want to be cheered up when I'm feeling melancholy, I sometimes like to have someone lighten me up a little.</li>
<li>* Don't tell me I'm too sensitive or that I'm overreacting!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>What I Like About Being an Ingrid</strong> 
<ul>
<li>* my ability to find meaning in life and to experience feeling at a deep level</li>
<li>* my ability to establish warm connections with people</li>
<li>* admiring what is noble, truthful, and beautiful in life</li>
<li>* my creativity, intuition, and sense of humor</li>
<li>* being unique and being seen as unique by others</li>
<li>* having aesthetic sensibilities</li>
<li>* being able to easily pick up the feelings of people around me</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>What's Hard About Being an Ingrid</strong> 
<ul>
<li>* experiencing dark moods of emptiness and despair</li>
<li>* feelings of self-hatred and shame; believing I don't deserve to be loved</li>
<li>* feeling guilty when I disappoint people</li>
<li>* feeling hurt or attacked when someone misundertands me</li>
<li>* expecting too much from myself and life</li>
<li>* fearing being abandoned</li>
<li>* obsessing over resentments</li>
<li>* longing for what I don't have</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>Ingrids as Children Often</strong> 
<ul>
<li>* have active imaginations: play creatively alone or organize playmates in original games</li>
<li>* are very sensitive</li>
<li>* feel that they don't fit in</li>
<li>* believe they are missing something that other people have</li>
<li>* attach themselves to idealized teachers, heroes, artists, etc.</li>
<li>* become antiauthoritarian or rebellious when criticized or not understood</li>
<li>* feel lonely or abandoned (perhaps as a result of a death or their parents' divorce)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>Ingrids as Parents</strong> 
<ul>
<li>* help their children become who they really are</li>
<li>* support their children's creativity and originality</li>
<li>* are good at helping their children get in touch with their feelings</li>
<li>* are sometimes overly critical or overly protective</li>
<li>* are usually very good with children if not too self-absorbed</li>
</ul>

"event","I got a letter in the mail a couple weeks ago now that Comcast has increased the speed of my internet connection to 12 Mbps from the 6 it was previously. Oddly though, the connection between my modem and my router is 10Base-T. So there's 2Mbps that are MIA. Although I have to admit, this makes Comcast <strong>substantially</strong> more competitive compared to Qwest's offerings for DSL and DirecTV packages.

I've also noticed commercials on Comcast that as of March 18, channels 32-71 will be transitioned to their digital tiers only. This is the suck because I'll have to get a digital cable box for the bedroom (and pay for it) again.

Hmm... well, between the need to change cell phone plans and the upcoming expiration of my Comcast promos, I guess it'll be time to re-evaluate at that point.

Took down the tree tonight and put it all away. The living room is officially back to normal.

My step dad may be coming down to help install a much-needed new fan in my master bathroom either this Sunday or next Sunday, depending on his work schedule.

I should sleep, took the Nyquil after watching Kathy Griffin and Anderson Cooper drop the LED ball in Times Square, but I took a mega nap this afternoon so I'm not sure if I can. I'll give it a whirl though."

I'm long overdue for an update, and as I'm just now caught up on all the entries everyone else made... well, I should say SOMETHING.

Took off from work at noon on 12/24 to capture the window in the weather to make it home for the xmas thingy. Got all the way up onto the mountain before my car went sliding backwards down a hill, landing front-end into the ditch. Better than going off the cliff. Neighbors pulled my rear around so I could back down the hill, but during the time I was stuck so much snow had dropped onto my car from the overhanging trees and, well, the sky, my back window and mirrors were all watered-over and what with the road and the ditches being all white and full of snow I caught my left-rear wheel on the ditch and got stuck again. Called home (luckily was still in cell reception) and had my step-brother and mom came along and pulled me further into the ditch. Another neighbor tried to pull me out while we were waiting for my step dad to come along with the Massey-Ferguson tractor... I've never seen a Chevy Silverado flagelate in the road like that.

Finally got my car out and left it stranded at the end of the logging road, and so began my days of being off-grid. 

12/25 we opened some gifts. My gifts were well received I believe, but one is still being waited on for work to hold their computer equipment sale. I got some awesome tools - a Snap-on six wheeled creeper, a Snap-on 2.5 ton floor jack, and a 17 mm wrench - I can now change my oil! I also got a food processor, a detail sander, some weird outdoor slipper things, money, and a bottle of Bacardi.

I convinced people for a trip to my car so I could visit my other family on 12/26. Visited with my grampa (dad's dad) and his...lady friend...and had dinner. He liked the gifts that I bought him. Then went over to Dad's and ended up having dinner again. I kinda sat around and visited to just overcome cabin fever, then headed home. My cousin Kathy came by with her husband and kids that evening, but I didn't see them until the next day because the kids were put to bed and he and she went to Porky's (a bar).

Next day we ended up going to grandma's (mom's mom) for a bit, then came back home. Really...boring day.

Saturday step dad and I ran down to my condo to pick up his gift to Mom I'd been hiding (a plasma TV for the bedroom) and, thanks to <lj user=""twitbucket"">, a wireless headset so she can watch tv without disturbing him while he's sleeping. She was BEYOND surprised and loves it! The tv is nice too.

I'm finally back at my own place. The snow had melted yesterday, but I didn't leave until today because Mom wanted to go see my cousin Michelle (the paralyzed one) since she's come home from a nursing home for her broken leg to heal.

Blargh...overall relaxing, but long and rather...tiring, due to being without cell phone reception or really any internet access at all."

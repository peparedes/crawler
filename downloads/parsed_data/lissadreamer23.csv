If not, I would be extremely surprised.&nbsp; Totally over all-nighters unless it's during the craziness of finals week.&nbsp;Hoping I can still get a 4.0 this semester though it's looking like I might have a few B+'s coming my way. I&nbsp;always tend to guess lower though...<br /><br />Failing at life overall right now.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is cold and rainy and I have to go to work in a few minutes. At Mom's right now watching Harry&nbsp;Potter 5 with Jordan and Brandon. <br /><br />I love being a TA. It makes my life. :)&nbsp;<br /><p>Also I talked to a certain someone online for like an hour last night. Hoping he's not just trying to be polite because I'd like to be his friend. He's very mature, compassionate, and intellectual. Prereqs to be my friend ya know.<br /><br />It's nice that so many people are shedding false identities and friends are true friends now. <br /><br />Waiting for my graduation application to be approved.&nbsp;I keep checking the mail...<br /><br />Loving my little hat that I bought in Pasadena!&nbsp;<br /><br />Loving the&nbsp;Muse song &quot;Starlight.&quot;<br /><br />John Mayer has a new album coming out soon. :)<br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

"event","So today while I&nbsp;was on my break at work, I&nbsp;received two very important e-mails:<br /><br /><strong>#1 My U2 concert IS being filmed for the DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </strong><br />I&nbsp;closed the door to the back office at work and jumped around a bit! Then I&nbsp;called my Mom. I think I gushed about it to some random clients too.<br /><br />#2 I&nbsp;passed the&nbsp;CBEST&nbsp;exam!&nbsp;I didn't expect to pass the essay portion because I ran out of time during the second essay. It actually worries me a little because it was so terribly written and I didn't even get a terrible score so... who are we allowing to teach our children?!&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;might be bipolar LOL...<br /><br />Oh!&nbsp;Funny story:&nbsp;So the guy Erin talked to who wanted to be friends with me was apparently not the name she said... because I&nbsp;started talking to the guy we thought on Facebook and he was so confused. LOL... I&nbsp;knew it was too good to be true that such an awesome, gorgeous guy would want to get to know me better. It's just this other average looking guy.... ::sigh::&nbsp;Thanks, Erin. I&nbsp;still &lt;3 you.<br /><br />MUST&nbsp;work on this presentation...<br /><br />"

"event","Life is HARD right now. 

And I&nbsp;know people have it worse and I&nbsp;feel guilty for struggling and complaining because I am more aware than most of the hardships faced by others.&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel more for them than for myself, but I&nbsp;also know I&nbsp;shouldn't feel bad for me at all. I'm not a child soldier who is kidnapped from his family and forced to kill his siblings and fight or die. I'm not starving to death. I'm not living in a country experiencing genocide. I'm not even living in a dangerous neighborhood or dealing with addiction or tragic loss of any kind.

I&nbsp;have a fun job (some days) with health benefits, I have a great fiancee, I&nbsp;have Bodhi who is the light of my life, I'm a TA for my favorite professor, I'm praised by professors constantly, I'm doing good in the world through Invisible Children, I own a home, there are 3 cars in the driveway (I&nbsp;feel a little excessive about that one), I'm graduating in the Spring with honors, and I have some great friends.

Not to mention I'm going to see the best, biggest, most amazing band in the world on Sunday. 

Yet.... I've been crying almost every day recently and spouting off that I'm only living for Sunday and then &quot;what else do I&nbsp;have to look forward to?&quot;&nbsp;so I don't know if it's a chemical imbalance or what...

I am overwhelmed. &nbsp;I&nbsp;hate that work has become all about #s and $ and corporate obligations, I&nbsp;hate that I&nbsp;work my butt off for this class and the professor hardly even responds to my e-mails&nbsp;(even though I&nbsp;know he's just busy and he really appreciates all my work), and I&nbsp;hate getting hardly any sleep EVER. I&nbsp;asked for less hours today at work after talking to Tim about it... I'm applying for a sub job at UHS that I probably won't get because the first question on there is &quot;Religion:______&quot;&nbsp;followed by &quot;Church:______&quot;? Oh!&nbsp;There's also &quot;Why do you want to teach at a Catholic school?&quot; I&nbsp;can not even begin to express how wrong that is that they ask that before even asking about teaching experience or personal pedagogy. As one who could easily BS it all and conform, I won't because I&nbsp;believe in honesty and I&nbsp;don't want the bad karma. ;) I&nbsp;fully support hiring individuals whose pedagogy and philosophy includes instilling morals, but how about some critical thinking too? Let us not indoctrinate. Please. Jesus.

LOL.

To quote &quot;Religulous,&quot;&nbsp;let's hope they're &quot;Christ-like and not just Christians.&quot;

Even as I&nbsp;write this, I&nbsp;know this is all silly (except the application thing. That is really not ok). I&nbsp;know that it'll all work out.&nbsp;I know that I&nbsp;have it EASY at this stage in life. The universe is always good to me, I love everything I'm doing, but it's just all at once all the time.&nbsp;I&nbsp;did 6 loads of laundry yesterday, cleaned the bathroom, and hardly got anything done for school. Today:&nbsp;worked, came home, burnt out, wanted to sleep, grocery store, research, who knows what else?&nbsp;It's bed time now... still need a shower. Have to get up at 7am. And this is a relatively light weekend...

And then there's the big things:&nbsp;
I'm not going to be able to have kids until I'm WAY older than I&nbsp;wanted to be and that's a HUGE&nbsp;sacrifice for me
My sister is completely verbally abusive in front of my brother
Work (which matters not at all in the scheme of things) is taking away from my plan for straight A's (or at least SLEEP)
When are we going to travel and live and experience the world? Someday?
We do nothing together....because we're busy
Tim doesn't believe in a higher power, spirits, NOTHING. 
Apparently, I&nbsp;need to keep a job with health benefits or have my name taken off the house so it isn't leverage in the event of an accident.
(Why is that even an issue that the government would let someone owe money FOREVER and have their plans ruined (I don't want to say life because life can still be fulfilling without material wealth)&nbsp;because of an accident. It's absurdly unfair really.&nbsp;And how can kids that need help not be treated because their parents can't afford it?&nbsp;That's just WRONG on any level. this is NOT&nbsp;a political issue. This is a HUMAN issue.)

I&nbsp;know. Poor me right? &lt;-----sarcasm

It really comes down to this:
There's not enough time
&quot;Sometimes you can't make it on your own&quot;
&quot;You give yourself away&quot;
and the fact that I&nbsp;absolutely can't handle giving less than 100% at anything (so much for parallel structure...there was no lyric for the last one) and having so many responsibilities requires me to be average at ALL&nbsp;of them. I&nbsp;want to be recognized as the best.... I still am by professors, but I can tell the quality of my work has gone down. It's nothing I'm proud to save and look back upon...

I feel bad for Tim because I don't want him to think it's anything he's doing wrong or that he isn't making me happy. He treats me wonderfully and has really been there for me. 

I'm just an INFP girl with a sensitive soul. The Idealist temperament...::sigh:: we take on all the &quot;pains and pleasures of the world&quot; ya know?

At least &quot;House&quot;&nbsp;is on tomorrow... I'm hoping to get at least a few things accomplished before I&nbsp;leave for Pasadena...

Can't wait to hear &quot;Streets&quot;&nbsp;live!&nbsp;=)"

"event","I finally have a day off! :) <br /><br />Doing laundry (currently on load 5), cleaning, and trying to get all my homework done before I leave on Friday. <br /><br /><strong>6 days until we leave for the U2 concert already!</strong>&nbsp;Mom is completely willing to wait in the GA&nbsp;line with me to get in the inner circle and I&nbsp;can not believe I'm really going to see them live. There are no words...&nbsp; I'm really hoping they play &quot;Bad.&quot;&nbsp;I told my mom if I grab her and freak out, it's probably the beginning of &quot;Bad.&quot;&nbsp;haha. The setlist is a little too heavy on the new material, but it's still going to be amazing. The best day of my life even if I just heard &quot;Streets.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />I also recently got really into <strong>INXS</strong>. Michael Hutchence was the most amazing performer EVER. He also happened to be friends with Bono. Some of their lyrics are a little too surface level for me, but the &quot;Live Baby Live&quot;&nbsp;DVD&nbsp;from Wembley is the best concert film I&nbsp;have ever seen. No contest. RIP&nbsp;beautiful soul. His daughter Tiger Lily looks just like him and is supposed to be in a children's film soon. Hoping she handles the spotilght better than Hutch and her mother did.<br /><br /><strong>Bodhi</strong> is the light of my life and I&nbsp;could not imagine pulling some of these all-nighters without him laying on my lap purring.&nbsp;He also gives Tim and I&nbsp;something to care about and talk about together which is nice. I love waking up with Bodhi right next to me with his paw over my arm. Only issue is that he bites my hair if it's too close to him!&nbsp;<br /><br />Being a<strong> TA</strong>&nbsp;is a dream come true. I&nbsp;wish it was Romanticism or something, but I love helping with their papers and I&nbsp;love grading quizzes. We had a fire alarm the other night and he was so funny because he was like &quot;Hey guys one more thing&quot;&nbsp;and kept talking and then he wanted to pass back quizzes. They were like &quot;um...there's actually a fire.&quot;&nbsp;haha. The best moments so far were the day after they turned their papers in because I&nbsp;had gotten to know them through corresponding about their drafts, when Tim gave me the key to his office to go get something (I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;actually had happy tears in my eyes), and the day they all figured out how to read closer and did great on their quizzes. <br /><br />One of the students, who is kind of a friend now, brought me a Milky Way because he saw I&nbsp;was working in the library too and said &quot;Thanks for helping me.&quot;&nbsp;:)<br /><br />I'm also really good friends with <strong>Erin</strong> now.&nbsp;We had Indian food together at Shangri-La last week and we just went to Mom's Cal-Skate reunion together last night.&nbsp;She is younger, but really fun, sweet, and outgoing.&nbsp;I crack her up with my usual obsessions... this guy in our class in GORGEOUS&nbsp;and consistantly scores really high on quizzes. He seems very cerebral and is just... o m g. But he is only 20 and I&nbsp;hear that he is kind of a jerk from another guy in there... hmmm...&nbsp;Technically it is sooo inappropriate that I&nbsp;talk to Erin about it since he is a student and she is a student, but ::shrug::<br /><br />Tim just recently went to <strong>Yosemite</strong> and climbed half dome with Brad!&nbsp;It looked gorgeous and we are planning to go back in the Spring when the waterfalls are even better. Can't wait!&nbsp;:)<br /><br />Kamala and I&nbsp;went to see the <strong>Killers</strong> a few weeks ago at the Arco arena. I&nbsp;was lucky and found tickets for $18 (for both) so we decided we should go. We were far away, but it was very cool to hear everyone chanting &quot;I got soul, but I'm not a soldier&quot;&nbsp;together in the area and I LOVE&nbsp;their songs &quot;Dustland Fairytale&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;On Top.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />I volunteered myself to do a <strong>presentation</strong> about writing tips and MLA on Wednesday for&nbsp;Tim's class (professor Tim). Hoping to do a great job, but considering I'm supposed to be working on it right now... haha. Too much to do.<br /><br />Mr. Buell from UHS lives next to my mom and he wants me to start subbing now, but how am I supposed to do that when I&nbsp;have to do all my observation hours still this semester. (Haven't even set them up yet....special huh?) Although, it would be a great time to leave my other<strong> job </strong>considering they are getting WAY&nbsp;too focused on numbers and $$$$$. It's starting to not be fun anymore. More stress than it's worth really even though I&nbsp;adore everyone who works there. So that's kind of all up in the air for the first time... I&nbsp;was planning on staying until August, but if something falls in my lap I'll take it!&nbsp;<br /><br />Need to get my <strong>tattoo</strong> soon.&nbsp;Going to be &quot;Carry Each Other&quot;&nbsp;with a music note&nbsp;(treble clef). I'm out of money... haha too much clothes.<br /><br />We LOOOVEEE&nbsp;Joel McHale's new show Community.&nbsp;It's so funny!&nbsp;<br /><br />Tim's laying down with a migraine right now and I'm getting sleepy too... Going to his parents for dinner soon. Have to switch the laundry. <br /><br /><br />"

The stage is AMAZING!&nbsp;I&nbsp;hope my Mom is willing to wait in line for a LONG time to get close. 

I really wish they had included &quot;New Years Day,&quot;&nbsp;&quot;Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own,&quot;&nbsp;&quot;Stay&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;! Otherwise, I&nbsp;think they did a nice job balancing old and new in the setlist. I&nbsp;was glad they chose not to include very many songs from Pop and Zooropa.&nbsp;However, when I&nbsp;realized &quot;Bad&quot;&nbsp;wasn't being played, I&nbsp;screamed &quot;Oh my God&quot;&nbsp;and scared Tim! Haha.

Very cool that they dedicated a song to Michael Jackson...

They HAVE to add &quot;Shine Like Stars&quot;&nbsp;onto With or Without You. I don't even care if they play it if they don't add that verse.

Most looking forward to:&nbsp;Probably &quot;Streets&quot; &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot;&nbsp;&quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; &quot;No Line&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot;&nbsp;(not my fave song, but awesome live)!

"event","After many many many years, I&nbsp;finally have my own cat! He is more than a pet to me-- he is a lifelong dream come true and family member. I have always been an animal lover and I&nbsp;believe in having animals as members of the family. My kitten's name is Bodhi and he is from the shelter. Amazingly, Bodhi was the name given to him at the shelter and we wouldn't have kept it had it been any other name. Bodhi means enlightenment and understanding in Sanskrit!&nbsp;I&nbsp;was already aware of the Buddhist term &quot;Bodhisattva&quot;&nbsp;which denotes one who has acheived nirvana and returns to live on earth in order to help others gain enlightenment as well. :) LOVE&nbsp;IT! I&nbsp;still want a birman and a bengal someday, but I&nbsp;didn't want to be on the waiting list all summer and not get to spend the summer with our new baby! It was really a spur of the moment thing. We were still on the waiting list for a Birman kitten and she had a litter due in a few weeks so we were keeping our fingers crossed for a lilac point. I&nbsp;had the weekend off and we had went to the town green, lunch at Hi-Tech Burrito, and then decided just to go take a look. I never expected to come home with one. Tim and I&nbsp;were very pleased to see the shelter so crowded with people rather than animals. Many animals were being adopted, including Bodhi's brothers and sister. We held all the kittens in his litter and he seemed to have the best temperament and enjoy being held the most.

He is a sweetheart. He always wants to be near us. He is hot tonight, though so he is laying on the hard wood floor where he can still see me. He usually lays under the computer chair at my feet. He just had his first spoonful of wet food today because the vet said he could eat it in small portions. 

We are so proud of him; he's Mommy's good boy!&nbsp;I&nbsp;was worried about leaving him when I&nbsp;went to Washington for Justin's graduation, but he ended up getting right back to normal when I&nbsp;came home!&nbsp;:)

Washington was FABULOUS! It was so nice to see everyone... I'm so proud of Justin and Lexi!! Justin graduated as an &quot;Eagle scholar&quot;&nbsp;and he excelled in tennis and golf and participated in all sorts of dance competitions etc. Lexi Lou just made the cheer squad and is a varsity tennis player already as a freshman! I can't believe I&nbsp;hadn't seen Justin in 2 yrs! I had seen Lexi and Wendy more recently for Mike and Deyon's wedding while Justin was in Europe. Every time I see him we automatically revert back to being like best friends. We had such a nice night together when we stayed up talking for hours!&nbsp;We talked about everything from girlfriends and school to religion to gay marriage and abortion. It was by far the highlight of the trip. I&nbsp;also enjoyed shopping with Lexi at TJ&nbsp;Max and riding in the car with&nbsp; Grandma Patti to the airport. Justin, Grandma Patti and I&nbsp;are the cuddlers in the family. When we went to the reunion in Oregon a few years ago, some people thought we were together!!!&nbsp;haha...It is hard to explain... we have always had a inexplicable, deep connection. We came to the conclusion that our souls must have known each other before. Because really, I&nbsp;didn't meet him until we were in our teens and I've probably only been around him a total of 5 or so times... It wasn't as hard to leave this time because usually it's like &quot;Bye!&nbsp;I&nbsp;have no idea when I'll see you. It could be years&quot;&nbsp;but I&nbsp;know I'll see everyone for Thanksgiving at Gma Patti's house and then again in May at my college graduation!&nbsp;This year and next year are just surreal...there is always some lifelong dream just around the corner it seems. Bodhi (who is now sleeping next to my feet), U2 concert, TAing for my favorite professor, graduation, etc. etc....

Speaking of TAing, I ended up calling Tim and telling him about the crazy SSU dilemma because I&nbsp;wanted to let him know that I probably couldn't TA for him next semester. He said he would not only let me into his World Lit class, but also that I&nbsp;can TA&nbsp;for the class!&nbsp;He actually said I&nbsp;could get credit for the class but instead of writing papers I can help him grade papers and make quizzes etc. O&nbsp;M&nbsp;G. Could that GET&nbsp;any better? I figure I will have plenty of papers to write for my two other senior level English classes. The hardcore thing is that I'll have class Monday-Thursday though. I&nbsp;suppose I would much rather be in class than at work so it works for me! 

U2 recently began rehearsals in Barcelona for the 360 tour!!!!&nbsp;It reminded me how excited I was/am. I&nbsp;ended up listening to U2 the whole way to and from work today. Here is the set list as they rehearsed it (with my comments):

Magnificent (ok)
 City Of Blinding lights (cool)
 Get on Your Boots (Why?! Well I guess it will be a fun song live. I guess they have to play the single)
 Elevation (WHY?!)
 Beautiful Day (ok)
 Breathe (ok)
 I Still Have'nt Found What I'm Looking For (YAY!)
 Unforgettable fire (Ohhh YAY!&nbsp;An old surprise!)
 Drowning Man (Would have rather heard &quot;Like a Song&quot;&nbsp;from War album)
 In a little while (OMG&nbsp;HAPPY&nbsp;HAPPY&nbsp;HAPPY)
 Unknown Caller (cool!)
 Moment of Surrender (ok)
 Pride (cool)
 MLK (Nice segue)
 Where The Streets Have No Name (Of course. Highlight of any U2 show!)
 Ultraviolet (eh)
 Vertigo (eh)
 With or without you (Yay!&nbsp;bring me up on stage pleaaaaseee)
 I'll Go Cray If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight (cool)
 No Line On The Horizon (Fave from new album)
One (I don't know where in the order this was rehearsed because it was a different day! So glad this is included!)
 
So, at first glance, I&nbsp;was excited. Mostly because I&nbsp;saw &quot;In a Little While,&quot;&nbsp;&quot;Unforgettable Fire,&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;Streets.&quot;&nbsp;Then after super overwhelmed, orgasmic feelings, I realized that NEW&nbsp;YEAR'S&nbsp;DAY&nbsp;is NOT&nbsp;on the setlist. Neither is &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;Stay&quot;&nbsp;or &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday.&quot;&nbsp;I am remaining hopeful that they just know them SO&nbsp;well that they do not need to rehearse and/or they want to surprise us. They must KNOW that &quot;Bad&quot; is a fan favorite. &quot;Stay&quot;&nbsp;is Bono's favorite... and hellloooo New Year's Day is just transcendently phenomenal. I was also hoping for &quot;Who's Gonna Ride your Wild Horses&quot;&nbsp;though that one I figured was a long shot.&nbsp;

Ps.&nbsp;I got into the Twilight books. Just finished the third one on the plane-- it is the best by far! I don't feel like the author is necessarily a gifted writer, but I&nbsp;love the plot and they are really engrossing. I&nbsp;need to order the final book soon and then I&nbsp;want to read Keats' autobiography!&nbsp;

Pps. I started class at the JC... it's kind of boring because many students are at a very basic level, but pretty easy. Professor is very smart and I wish he would share more of his knowledge with us. Sometimes it is entertaining, like when a whole group of 5 people have 40 minutes to summarize any article from a newspaper and they share their article about &quot;Opera&quot;&nbsp;search engine and think that it said &quot;Oprah&quot;&nbsp;and say that she is the CEO&nbsp;of the web browser hahahahaha. WOW. It was hysterically funny.

Did great at work today: 3.5 UPT!&nbsp;Whoo!

Also feeling good because I&nbsp;made Tim a burger tonight and he absolutely loved it!&nbsp;I&nbsp;felt so appreciated and loved. :)

Love &amp;&nbsp;Peace,
Lissa"

Yesterday:&nbsp;so productive--work, laundry (stupid black and white tops turning black and tan!), dishes, guitar, reading, studying for CBEST etc.
Day before:&nbsp;Day off with Tim-- target, REI, Starbucks, watched &quot;American Beauty&quot;&nbsp;(one of my faves)

EDIT:&nbsp;June 5th 2009
After I don't even want to know how many years, I am officially a senior! I've had enough units to be a senior for a long time, but in my mind, I couldn't consider myself a senior until my actual last year of college. When I&nbsp;graduate next May it will have been 6 years to complete my BA . Really though, there is not one semester that I wish didn't happen. I&nbsp;enjoy being in the classroom and it has flown by, especially since transferring to Sonoma. :)

Speaking of Sonoma, they really did something unfair the other day. I went online to check my grades and saw an e-mail that basically read, &quot;Attn. all English single-subject majors:&nbsp;The following courses will no longer be a part of our program and these additional classes will be required prior to graduation&quot; So then I'm crying my eyes out, thinking I will have to alter my entire course plan and stay an extra semester. The universe was working in my favor again-- of all the courses they added, I&nbsp;only needed one.&nbsp;I just happened to take the other ones already because they seemed like the most interesting options. The only really sad thing is that I have to call my favorite professor and tell him I&nbsp;can no longer TA&nbsp;because I&nbsp;need to take Modern World Literature next semester instea (If anyone lets me in!!&nbsp;I&nbsp;emailed an old professor and asked if she could let me in since the course was full and I was very upset when she treated me just like any other student and told me some robotic crap about how Fall 09 graduates will have priority and then Spring 10 and that I&nbsp;should look at some online universities or sit in on the first day. No mention of my final paper being great or that she knows it is an inconvenience or ANYTHING). So, I&nbsp;am taking a course on mass communication at SRJC&nbsp;and Psychology of Intuition at SSU and no longer TAing freshman composition with a brilliant professor which was kind of my dream...

In happy college news, I&nbsp;had a 4.0 this semester!&nbsp;I usually have an A- so I end up with like 3.8s or 3.9s. I was ecstatic!&nbsp;I&nbsp;found out while I&nbsp;was at work and I&nbsp;ran out of the break room and hugged Amanda who also did really well this semester. It hardly raised my cumulative though...I had a 3.53 and now I have a 3.56 or something like that... It will be higher when I&nbsp;retake a class in the Spring that I&nbsp;got a UW in (unoffical withdraw) which basically counts as an F. I already retook the other one I had that in and my GPA went up .2 so my Magna Cum Laude 3.75 is still a possibility! I&nbsp;long shot, but a possibility nonetheless. Regardless, I&nbsp;will graduate Cum Laude with awesome honor cords and a Psi Chi medallion for Psychology honors too. Tiff and I love graduation &quot;bling&quot; as we call it!

Tiffany is going to do the credential program at Sac State and I&nbsp;really hope we keep in touch. Every semester I become close with someone who is graduating that semester. TAing with her was a lot of fun and we share a lot of the same ideas and beliefs. I've never met any one with such a similar ideology to my own. The professor we worked with came across as very fake once I&nbsp;got to know her, but it was still great and we will all have a great letter of recommendation out of it anyway...

The highlights of this semester: Jan-May 2009
TAing family psych
Fave professor saying I was &quot;brilliant&quot;--that makes two professors who have told me that.&nbsp;The head of the English dept. at LMU and him. I'm just not saying his name because I&nbsp;don't want anyone to search his name and find my journal or something!&nbsp;haha. He is so amazing and he has a PhD from Stanford. :) I&nbsp;just really hope that we will stay in touch even though I&nbsp;am no longer TAing...maybe I&nbsp;can do it in the Spring.
OUR&nbsp;FIRST&nbsp;HOUSE:&nbsp;Moved in January 10th. It's really come a LONG&nbsp;way!&nbsp;We just hung drapes in the living room which I&nbsp;am in love with and ordered some art today. We are on a waiting list for a birman-- the cat breed I've wanted since I&nbsp;was in 6th grade. :)&nbsp;
Prop 8 protest (Actually November, but I&nbsp;don't think I&nbsp;put it on here yet)
Tim started his search and rescue
Little Jake Webster was born a few days ago!!&nbsp;I have a new cousin!
All the drama with Jordan and her boyfriend and being kicked out of her dad's house... O&nbsp;M&nbsp;G
Birthday-- Indian food and then upper fourth. I got to catch up with Sarah!
Lunch with you-know-who... even though he is dumb and makes me think we are friends all the time and then decides not to talk to me ever...
My shopping spree at the mall by myself after my bday!
Our DSM&nbsp;at work came in to observe us last week and totally loved me and thanked me for doing a great job!&nbsp;(she isn't that kind of person)

Music this semester:
 Kris Allen winning AI (&quot;Oh Baby!&quot;)
The Fray's new album Feb-- an all-time fave
U2's album (No Line on the Horizon) released March 3rd
Discovered one of my fave songs &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;&nbsp;by the Waterboys

Low points:
I&nbsp;wasn't chosen for a scholarship (wtf?) 
Reading the e-mail about the program changing and feeling completely hopeless and screwed over
Gay marriage ruling by Supreme Court... CA has some work to do... :( It is absurd that anyone is allowed to vote on someone's marriage or personal life to begin with, but since they are hopefully people develop some higher morality...&quot;Love is the higher law&quot;...

Upcoming:
Hawaii was almost a whole year ago?! NO&nbsp;WAY!
Summer classes
Tattoo?&nbsp;I&nbsp;want one for sure, I'm just indecisive about what to get and the layout right now! Probably &quot;Love is a temple, Love the higher law&quot;&nbsp;with a music note next to it!
Going to Seattle next week with Grandma Patti for Justin's grad!&nbsp;
U2 CONCERT&nbsp;in LA&nbsp;with Mom AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH&nbsp;OCT 25th!!!&nbsp;I can not believe I&nbsp;am really going to see them live!!

The rest of the summer is just working, reading, practicing guitar, decorating, and being happy! Hopefully Kristen will be able to come visit!&nbsp;

Next semester classes:&nbsp;
World Lit (thanks SSU...pfft)
Classical Lit and Myth (YAY!) 
Explorations in Language&nbsp;(YAY!)
If I can get into the world lit class I&nbsp;want, I can only be on campus Tues and Thurs! 

I&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;OFF&nbsp;THIS&nbsp;WEEKEND!&nbsp;Buddy is spending the night tonight and meeting Baxter. I&nbsp;have to stop at the store to get him milk since we don't drink it... Tomorrow we are going to his Tball game and then Tim and I are exploring the town green and having lunch there!&nbsp;:) Sunday I think we are staying home and I'm hoping to rent a few movies. I&nbsp;need to see:&nbsp;Slumdog Millionaire, Milk, Once&nbsp;(LOVE&nbsp;the SONG!!!), and Tim hasn't seen Twilight yet. I just started reading the series... I like the story, but I don't think they are well-written necessarily... I kind of just want to see what happens next. 

Life is good... 11 months til graduation and I&nbsp;know it will come too soon!"

"event","<br />My friend and fellow Psychology TA just got engaged at Disneyland this weekend in front of the castle!&nbsp;:)&nbsp; She is also graduating next week and just found out she was admitted to the credential program. I am SO&nbsp;happy for her!&nbsp;<br /><br />One more essay and I am DONE&nbsp;for the year!&nbsp;It's a big one though 7-10 pages and it kind of determines whether I&nbsp;get to TA&nbsp;for my favorite professor or not...I've been researching since 3pm and it's 1am (not straight or anything though). Spent some time with Tim ;) and went to Carl's Junior too. Of course, there was some Kris Allen photo-hunting and video watching in between as well. <br /><br />I want a topic to really come to me that I&nbsp;can be really passionate about. I may respond to a scholar's essay stating that Shelley's &quot;Hymn to Intellectual Beauty&quot;&nbsp;is merely a restatement of Wordsworth's &quot;Ode:&nbsp;Intimations of Immortality.&quot;&nbsp;Poor Shelley... I&nbsp;still love you. When I&nbsp;graduate next year I&nbsp;would LOVE to go to London and go to Shakespeare's house and Rome to the Keats-Shlley house and visit all the Romantics' grave sites.&nbsp;How amazing would that be...like a pilgrimage...haha.<p>My other possible essay topic was to examine Shelley's &quot;Mont Blanc&quot;&nbsp;and compare this representation of the imagination with other Shelley poems and contrast with other Romantics. <br /><br />Already memorized my poem for my final exam day recitation. It's a great passage (stanza 5) from Wordsworth's &quot;Intimations of Immortality.&quot;&nbsp;I'm going to attempt to type it without looking at anything:<br /><br />Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting<br />The soul that rises with us, Our life's star<br />Hath had elsewhere it's setting<br />and cometh from afar<br />Not in entire forgetfullness<br />and not in utter nakedness<br />But trailing clouds of glory do we come<br />From God, who is our home.<br />Heaven lies about us in our infancy!<br />Shades of the prison house begin to close upon the growing boy<br />But he beholds the light and whence it flows<br />He sees it in his joy.<br />The youth who daily farther from the East<br />must travel still is nature's priest<br />And by the vision splendid<br />is on his way attended<br />The man at length perceives it die away<br />and fade into the light of common day<br /><br /><br />Tomorrow is my TA&nbsp;luncheon with Dana.&nbsp;I think we are meeting at the HImilayan restaurant. Should be fun...hope my eye is less defective! I also really hope Tiff brings a camera.<br /><br />Need to get more done on my paper tomorrow than I&nbsp;did today...&nbsp;No more reading research to find the &quot;perfect&quot;&nbsp;topic. Just get it done.<br /><br />I&nbsp;still want my&nbsp; tattoo. &quot;Transcend&quot;&nbsp;with wings will be so cool!&nbsp;I loooove the U2 lyric &quot;Love is a temple, Love the higher law&quot;&nbsp;too though and &quot;Love is my religion&quot;&nbsp;~Keats and &quot;Progress is the business of the heart, not the intellect&quot;&nbsp;but it has the word business in it so I don't really want that on me forever.<br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

"event","Kris Allen is in the finale of American Idol! &quot;Oh Baby&quot; haha. While Adam obviously has a better vocal range and is born to be a performer, Kris' music is more along the lines of the soft rock, singer song-writer vibe that Tim and I&nbsp;prefer. Good luck to both of them on Tuesday night, though it really doesn't matter who wins.&nbsp;Or does it?&nbsp;Maybe it would be better for Kris to win just so he is kept in the forefront long enough to catch on with the masses.&nbsp;Adam is already very promoted by Idol and the media... we'll see how it goes. I feel like even though Kris is my favorite, Adam kind of deserves to win. (I didn't like his arrangement of &quot;One&quot;&nbsp;by the way. It didn't build up enough in the beginning to get to the oh so powerful 'Love is a temple, Love the higher law' section). I want whomever does the best on&nbsp;Tuesday to win and I&nbsp;won't vote for Kris unless he actually does the best finale night. We need more &quot;Falling Slowly&quot; style A-level performances from him. In my opinion, that song made him a serious contender in the competition!&nbsp; His rendition of &quot;Heartless&quot;&nbsp;seemed to give him an edge over Gokey. <br /><br />Gokey side note: Soooooo glad he's out.&nbsp;That was fair. Alison was better than him too!&nbsp;His &quot;You are so Beautiful&quot;&nbsp;was great but who in the world when given the opportunity to show they can be a contemporary recording artist and sell out arenas would EVER choose that song when given free choice??!! Crazy... Anyway, Gokey's scream was terrible in the aerosmith performance too.&nbsp;He had great moments and terrible moments while Kris and Adam never went into the realm of terrible.&nbsp;Their consistancy and artistry paid off. <br /><br />I was thinking yesterday while driving home from work about possible song choices for Kris in the finale. Here are my picks:<br /><br /><strong>&quot;Collide&quot;&nbsp;</strong><strong>~Howie Day</strong><br /><strong>&quot;Come on Get Higher&quot;&nbsp;~Matt Nathanson</strong><br />&quot;Crash&quot;&nbsp;~Dave Matthews Band (I know he won't do this one though)<br /><strong>&quot;Electrical Storm&quot;&nbsp;~U2</strong> (with acoustic guitar)<br />&quot;3AM&quot;&nbsp;~Matchbox Twenty (Piano version)<br />&quot;Closer to Love&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;Nothing left to Lose&quot;~Mat Kearney<br /><strong>&quot;You and I&nbsp;Both&quot;&nbsp;~Jason Mraz</strong> ( (People have been suggesting &quot;I'm Yours&quot; and just...no. It's too silly...)<br />&quot;Free Fallin'&quot;~ John Mayer's style (?)<br /><strong>&quot;The Scientist&quot;&nbsp;~Coldplay</strong><br />&quot;The Difference&quot;&nbsp;~Matchbox Twenty<br />&quot;In Your Eyes&quot;&nbsp;~Peter Gabriel<br /><strong>&quot;Walking in Memphis&quot;&nbsp;~Marc Cohn</strong><br />&quot;Last Request&quot;&nbsp;~Paolo Nutini<br />&nbsp;&quot;Name&quot; or &quot;Sympathy&quot; ~Goo Goo Dolls<br /><strong>&quot;Mr. Jones&quot;&nbsp;~Counting Crows </strong><br /><strong>&quot;Running to Stand Still&quot;&nbsp;~U2</strong><br />&quot;Rock N&nbsp;Roll&quot;&nbsp;~Eric Hutchinson<br />&quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;&nbsp;~Elton&nbsp;John<br /><br />Good ideas from AI&nbsp; message boards:<br />&quot;Secret&quot;&nbsp;~Maroon 5 (ohhh Matt Giraud would have done a great rendition of &quot;The Sun&quot;) <br />&quot;Landslide&quot;&nbsp;~Fleetwood Mac <br />&quot;You and Me&quot;&nbsp;~Lifehouse<br /> &quot;Fast Car&quot;&nbsp;~Tracey Chapman (may be weird for a guy?)<br /><br />My #1 choice:&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Never Say Never&quot;&nbsp;~The Fray</strong><br /><br /><p>Go Kris!

"event","I'm actually celebrating my birthday on Saturday night though. I&nbsp;have class and an advising appointment tomorrow so today was pretty much just another Tuesday. I worked in the morning and then got my hair done. It was actually a really nice surprise though after AI, Tim's mom brought out presents for me (a Coach wristlet and some super cute jewelery!)&nbsp; and some cupcakes! I thought I was getting presents when we went out to dinner. I'm a little addicted to cupcakes. I kept eating the frosting off one in the car on the way home. haha. <br /><br />Kris did awesome on Idol!&nbsp;Whooooooooo he'll be safe tomorrow. &quot;Falling Slowly&quot;&nbsp;last week was his best performance and probably earned him some new fans and votes.<br />Why does everyone, including the judges, say Danny does so great every week?&nbsp;He was an early favorite of mine too because he has a cool voice, but his performances are, as Simon put it, &quot;Awkward&quot; and he chooses songs that make it sound very karaoke. I dunno-- guess I'm just not feelin' it dawg.&nbsp;(Randy impression in case that was not obvious). <br />Bottom 3 prediction:&nbsp;Lil' rounds, Anoop, Matt<br />Going home prediction:&nbsp;Anoop, Lil' Rounds<br /><br />Tim stayed home from work today and yesterday because he passes out and has seizures from certain chemicals overwhelming his body when doctors give him eye drops (instance one)&nbsp;or shots (instance two). Scary but apparently the doctors think it is normal and say that it happens a few times per year. He has a sensitive vega-something-or-other artery that shuts down and he just collapses because his body doesn't know how to process the foreign chemicals. Anyway, he feels fine but he stayed home because when he fell he hit his head on the floor and now his head and neck are sore. <br /><br /><strong>Funny story: </strong><br />The bus in front of me did this first. I&nbsp;was on the phone and only half paying attention and just following the bus which was turning too. HAHA&nbsp;this is too funny. <br />So we were on the street before you turn onto the street with the JC parking garage that turns into Old Redwood Hwy. Anyway, that's not important. We're turning (the bus and I) and have our blinkers on, right?&nbsp;Right. So there are PARKED&nbsp;cars along the side of that road. PARKED, OFF, VACANT&nbsp;cars&nbsp;right?&nbsp;Ok. So the bus thinks they are just stopped at the red light and pulls up behind them with his blinker on waiting to turn.&nbsp;So he sits there for a minute and then goes around and I'm thinking &quot;Ok. He probably just needed to make up time and go another route.&quot;&nbsp;So I&nbsp;stay on the phone (speaker btw. None of the illegalness goin on) and I swear I could win an award for being the least observant person. I sit there for like 5 minutes (it felt like it anyway), mess with the radio, AC, talk on the phone, put on chapstick etc... People cross the cross walk behind me and kinda look at me oddly and now this is just taking FOREVER&nbsp;and I'm running late to my hair appt. so I&nbsp;think &quot;There must be an accident. This is taking really long. They can go right on red. What's the hold up?&quot;&nbsp;Hmmm... O&nbsp;M&nbsp;G. So THEN&nbsp;FINALLY&nbsp;now that the bus is gone and I&nbsp;can see more than 2 ft. in front of my car and I'm looking around for signs of an accident or a broken traffic light, I see that in front of the couple parked cars in front of me there are NO OTHER&nbsp;CARS. So I reverse a bit and go around and bust out laughing and call Tim and my Mom who then burst out laughing. Lovely...<br /><br />Advising appt, financial aid meeting, class, quiz?, Idol results tomorrow!&nbsp;:) The smiley face was only for Idol and the advising meeting. I&nbsp;like showing advisors how unbelievably organized and aware I&nbsp;am.&nbsp; We all will be seeing Kris' pretty face longer! I know he isn't very photogenic and not very cute from the front-on, but when he's singing and from the side he is gorgeous. I'm picky... I&nbsp;know. Tim's been doing his hair different and I&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;it. It's not a drastic change but it makes me happy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Haha I invited somebody to my bday dinner but he couldn't come. Good and bad I&nbsp;suppose.&nbsp;It would have been awkward to introduce him since all my friends know I've always found him attractive so they'd be all smirking and making comments. I know Melissa wouldn't be able to hold it back and Naomi might tell him he was going to hell. LOL&nbsp;not really. <br /><br />When I&nbsp;got my hair done Julie was asking about my sun sign and she was surprised I&nbsp;was a Taurus because I don't fit the stubborn bull stereotype. So I&nbsp;looked up the other characteristics (it'd been a while since I&nbsp;looked at that stuff) and read them off.&nbsp;I got to &quot;self-righteous&quot;&nbsp;and said &quot;Yea. I'll take that one&quot; and Julie was like &quot;No way. Are you serious?&nbsp;How?&quot;&nbsp;and my response was so non-chalant and worded funny but totally serious at the same time. I was like &quot;Well, basically I&nbsp;feel that my beliefs and the way I think are the right way and pretty much everybody who disagrees is just dumb.&quot;&nbsp;It was like a Romantic poet being transported to 2009 and speaking with really simple diction. Exaggerated (a wee bit), to the point, and honest... It sounds bad but I&nbsp;really feel blessed/proud/lucky/happy&nbsp; to believe the *right* things... radical empathy and outside the box thinking and morality not based on legality but on self-reflection all the way!&nbsp;<br /><br />Survivor is cracking me up lately. I&nbsp;wish it was still something everyone talked about. Tyson is such a jerk and Coach is just hilarious and it's all getting so deceptive and intriguing.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;REALLY&nbsp;hope I get to take Sociology of Religion or I&nbsp;might cry. We can only register for 9 units the first appointment and then the rest later so people only sign up for what they really need. LAAAMMMEE (but I&nbsp;get why).<br /><br />"

"event","<p><br />I&nbsp;had to meet with my favorite professor for a short conference about my essay yesterday. I&nbsp;had a dream about it the night before that it went totally horrible and I&nbsp;ended up crying in my dream version and trying to defend my writing ability. LOL. It turned out to be the exact opposite of that. It was about the paper I&nbsp;wrote when I&nbsp;was just getting over being sick and I&nbsp;really wasn't happy with the way it turned out. Amazingly, I&nbsp;received an A- on it when I&nbsp;probably would have only given it like a B range grade. I'm the toughest grader I&nbsp;know. Anyway, I&nbsp;walk in five minutes late because there was no parking on campus at 11am and he's like &quot;I was just talking about you&quot; and I&nbsp;was like &quot;With who?&quot;&nbsp;(I know it should have been &quot;whom&quot;&nbsp;but it's awkward to speak that way) and he said Stephanie. That's the girl he referred to as his favorite student the other day when I&nbsp;got hella jealous... So he says:<br /><br />&quot;We were talking about how there's two students in my class who would write about poetry and literature even if they didn't have to and that's you two. Am I&nbsp;right in assuming that?&quot;<br />&quot;Yea. Probably&quot; ::huge grin::<br />&quot;You're reserved in class but whenever you say something or write something, it is always brilliant.&quot;<br />&quot;Thank you. I've had a professor say that before. I&nbsp;always just feel like I&nbsp;won't be able to express what I'm thinking on the spot. I know I&nbsp;need to take more risks. You said you needed TAs. Which classes are you doing?&quot;<br />&quot;Social protest novel and freshman composition. Social protest novel is the more English majory of the two&quot;<br />&quot;Yea..would you be willing to consider for TAing the freshman composition course?&nbsp;I'm going to be a high school English teacher&quot;<br />&quot;Absolutely. I'll let you know when to register. I&nbsp;believe it is MWF&nbsp;at 11. I&nbsp;think that would be a perfect experience for you then.&nbsp;I just need somebody to read over and give feedback on short writing assignments. You know how slow I&nbsp;am with getting things back and they need the opportunity to do multiple drafts.&quot;<br />&quot;Definitely. I'm TAing right now for Family Psych so I've been grading papers in there already too. I&nbsp;just took Teaching Composition with Anne Marie and, well, you probably know, but there's been studies where students don't really care about comments on their papers or look for ways to improve them if they don't get to do another draft&quot;<br />&quot;Anne Marie is one of the best writers I&nbsp;have ever met. Sounds like I&nbsp;could probably learn from you too.&quot;<br />::huge smile:: &quot;She is a great teacher too.&quot;<br />&quot;So anyway, I&nbsp;gave your paper an A-....&quot;&nbsp;blablabla about my essay... parts he liked and didn't like etc.<br />We also talked about which other courses I&nbsp;need and when I'm graduating! Oh and he also said he loves the way I&nbsp;play with language and think about poetry.<br /><br />I&nbsp;thrive on praise, especially from professors. This professor is the most intelligent person I&nbsp;have ever known; I&nbsp;could sit and listen to him speak all day and it would not be boring. I'm gotten compliments from professors every semester, but this is just amazing that he would think so highly of me. It really means the world to me. :) I wish I&nbsp;was more comfortable talking with him instead of nodding my head and smiling, but I just haven't reached that comfort level yet. He was my professor for literary analysis as well and asked me to post the essay I&nbsp;wrote on Frankenstein online for other students to look at!&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;am the new TA&nbsp;for Freshman Composition with my favorite professor!&nbsp;Can't wait to tell everyone and even better, I&nbsp;can't wait for the word to get to the writing center people who didn't hire me. HA!&nbsp;No, I&nbsp;know my interview was awful...but they should just know that some people don't interview well and not ask 5 questions at a time...He could have asked any of my professors and they would have said I&nbsp;was far superior in skill level to some of my other peers that got hired (who don't have much depth of thought at all!). Wow...I didn't expect for that to be a whole rant. Anyway, it was not the right time and not the right reasons either. I&nbsp;am busy enough as it is and it would have been pretty awkward the way I&nbsp;used to act around you-know-who.<br /><br />OK&nbsp;SO I&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;OFFICIALLY&nbsp;BEEN&nbsp;CALLED&nbsp;&quot;BRILLIANT&quot; BY&nbsp;BOTH&nbsp;THE&nbsp;HEAD&nbsp;OF&nbsp;THE&nbsp;ENGLISH&nbsp;DEPT AT&nbsp;LMU&nbsp;AND&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;OF&nbsp;THE&nbsp;BEST&nbsp;PROFESSORS AT&nbsp;SONOMA&nbsp;STATE&nbsp;WHO&nbsp;WAS&nbsp;EDUCATED&nbsp;AT&nbsp;STANFORD&nbsp;AND&nbsp;BERKELEY!<br /><br />Life is so so good. <br /><br />Now I&nbsp;just have to freak out about my hour long presentation on Friday that I have zero time to work on!&nbsp;I&nbsp;already know what I'm wearing at least... &quot;Sexy boots yea...&quot; Hopefully I'll need to make some copies.<br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","Tickets:&nbsp;I officially have two general admission tickets to see U2 on October 25th in Los Angeles!&nbsp;I hope I&nbsp;can get there early enough--but not too early-- to get stage-front seats. I'm just worried that there will be fans lined up all night the night before to get in and my mom is not willing to do any of that. She's been joking about dropping me off on the sidewalk and coming back when I'm 4th in line LOL. I know it will be one of the best days of my life. I wish Tim was going to share it with me...or at least someone who liked U2... my mom and Tim both don't really love them, but my mom has been a great concert buddy in the past!&nbsp;

XBox:&nbsp;Tim ordered an XBox so we can play Guitar Hero together now.&nbsp;A few weeks ago when we were having a rough period, I was complaining about how we didn't do enough together. He had said that he felt like we would have something to do together if we got our Xbox that would be fun. I'm really excited. He's always the guitar player and I'm always the singer!&nbsp;:)

Talent Show: Brandon's kidnergarten talent show was last night! It was so awesome. He did his taekwando to music from Kung Fu Panda. I was so proud of him. Jordan and I&nbsp;talked a lot too... I'm starting to think Chuck is really not all that bad...it's not practical in the long term and they should go back to being friends...but from what Jordan has been saying, he doesn't sound like a weird pedophile.It was SUCH&nbsp;an awesome night laughing and tlaking with family and seeing the Rizzle be so awesome. I'm trying to remember all the hilarious quotes, but I know I can't... at one point it was fabulous because we were talking all secretively and not saying anything straight out in the car and&nbsp; Brandon SOMEHOW knew the situation and just cut in and said, &quot;Jordan. Your boyfriend is as old as Mommy and you're 17. I think it would be the right thing to break up with him&quot;&nbsp;or something to that effect. We just stared in amazement and cracked up. Jordan was like &quot;You be quiet, you shouldn't even know about that&quot;

Lunch: So my acquiantance/old friend/ ex-crush Matt works at the copy center so I&nbsp;usually see him on Fridays when I&nbsp;TA for Dana. I&nbsp;decided to text him and said &quot;I'm stealing you for lunch. k k?&nbsp; Do you have a break around 12:20?&quot;&nbsp;and he actually said it sounded good. I&nbsp;was pretty shocked. It was really nice. We walked to Quiznos cause we were both sick of Charlie Brown's. Walking out in the sunshine was actually the best part. I wish I&nbsp;felt like writing this in more detail. Anyways... I was totally comfortable around him now that I'm no longer infatuated and Tim and I&nbsp;have been getting along so well. So it felt like we were friends again and totally normal. The only time I&nbsp;was even slightly feeling awkward was because he made a joke about living with me when he got back from his summer travelling and it was like this hahaha... um... moment because I&nbsp;couldn't get out of being inside my own head thinking how weird it would be... We almost actually went to like a real sit-down himalayan restaurant which I thought was an odd idea for him to come up with... he always does this though... he's so polite and such a good guy that it seems like he wants to be friends and hang out and keep in touch but I&nbsp;dunno cuz he seemed like that in the past before too and then totally blew me off... Boys... I am just glad to be friends again and I'm gonna let him ask me next time around. :)&nbsp;We talked about everything- careers, travelling, adopting kids, jobs, Tim's job, Bono (everyone hates my Bono), friends, teaching, guitars, etc.

Some weird lady asked my Mom at T-ball practice who Jack was and straight out asked her &quot;Who's closer to him?&nbsp;Jack or Brian?&quot;&nbsp;Who says that?!&nbsp;That's bizarre.

I was the only one TAing today-- Tiff had to bring her dog to the vet and Loren had a family emergency so she went back to San Jose.&nbsp;Glad I decided to get out of bed today."

On American Idol last night the bottom three should have absolutely, unequivocally been:&nbsp;Michael Sarver (country guy), Scott (blind guy), and Megan (tattoo girl). This is not even a matter of subjectivity or opinion. They were measurably lesser quality performances. Unbelievably, Megan (who I&nbsp;could sing better than and probably any average person who enjoys singing in the car or living room), was not even in the bottom 3. Also unbelievably, MATT GIRAURD&nbsp;(who consistantly gives solid, fabulous vocal performances) was in the bottom 2. 

I've been trying to wrap my head around that... I guess because Matt hasn't shown enough about himself as a person for people to feel a connection or voting loyalty to. Every one I talk to says he did really well, but they don't remember his name and he seems to always be a second favorite. It could also partially be that he isn't aesthetically appealing... I mean, Kris is gorgeous but definitely not as good of a singer as Matt. Not gonna lie- I've voted for Kris to keep my eye candy around. ;)

Another reason people are stupid:&nbsp;Dozens of people marched in memory of the rapist-murderer guy in Oakland who just killed the four police officers. Now, I'm all for trying to understand how his past may have contributed to his actions or how he may have been failed by various systems (family, prison, whatever)... but that was beyond disrespectful and outright STUPID. Especially after watching Religulous, I think most people are just CRAZY... 

In other, somewhat related news, the lack of ability people have to think critically for themselves astounds me on a daily basis... postconventional thinking... come on people. Only 10% of people fall into the category of post-conventional thinkers. So very very sad. If you don't think for yourself, it's like you don't exist. You have no identity. Keats would agree with me :P. Even if you don't change things on a large scale, be able to have a free mind within yourself. It matters.

OMG&nbsp;my sister is moving to Oregon with Chuck in May probably... cuz she'll be 18."

Lyrics:

I pictured a rainbow
You held it in your hands
I had flashes
But you saw then plan
I wandered out in the world for years
While you just stayed in your room
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

You were there at the turnstiles
With the wind at your heels
You stretched for the stars
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon

I was grounded
While you filled the skies
I was dumbfounded by truths
You cut through lies
I saw the rain-dirty valley
You saw brigadoon
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon

I spoke about wings
You just flew
I wondered, I guessed, and I tried
You just knew
I sighed
You swooned
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

With a torch in your pocket
And the wind at your heels
You climbed on the ladder
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon!
The whole of the moon!

Unicorns and cannonballs,
Palaces and piers,
Trumpets, towers, and tenements,
Wide oceans full of tears,
Flag, rags, ferry boats,
Scimitars and scarves,
Every precious dream and vision
Underneath the stars

You climbed on the ladder
With the wind in your sails
You came like a comet
Blazing your trail
Too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon!"

"event","<strong>Class:</strong><br />I&nbsp;finished my paper a few days ago! I wasn't happy with it, but understandably... I was getting over being sick and stayed up til 4am to finish it. My topic was too broad to be a 3-5 page paper. It could have been a whole book. I&nbsp;always do this:&nbsp;I&nbsp;think of a topic and then I&nbsp;look through every single relevant text, read articles on it, read about the authors' lives etc. I&nbsp;get really into it and I&nbsp;don't want to leave anything out. There are SO&nbsp;many ways that bird imagery is used by Keats and Shelley as a symbol for a poet and MANY&nbsp;places in their poetics essays and personal letters that explain the role of the poet and even explicitly explain the connection between the skylark/nightingale and the poet and the birds' songs with poetry. It was nerve wracking to go to my professor's office after missing a week of class and turn it in... not to mention that he read most of my paper while I&nbsp;was sitting there!&nbsp;AHH!&nbsp; Despite the discomfort, I&nbsp;could listen to him talk for days. I was so glad that in class he spent more time lecturing because, really, I&nbsp;am not going to learn much from my peers and this guy is a brilliant scholar who has background knowledge and connections to theory and everything.&nbsp;<br /><br />We just had an assignment in which we had to reorganize Byron's &quot;The Giaour&quot;&nbsp;into chronological order. The poem ended up being like 30 pages long so I&nbsp;stayed up and worked through it and it really paid off. Only myself and one other student managed to get through the assignment. It made me talk in class which is something I&nbsp;hate doing, but at the same time, feel much better if I&nbsp;do it. It alleviates the pressure of being called upon and, usually, I&nbsp;am thinking along the same lines as the teacher. I&nbsp;shared like 4 times yesterday and once it was something that was easily overlooked in the text and he had the class raise their hands if they missed it and like everyone did. That felt really good, especially in a senior level class on my favorite literary era.<br /><br />To be honest, I&nbsp;stepped it up and spoke in class because I&nbsp;really look up to this professor and he made a comment about another girl being his favorite student because she speaks and puzzles through things as she goes in class. She &quot;hazards guesses&quot;&nbsp;as he put it. I have to be the favorite or at least one of his favorites. Besides, I'm smarter than she is. ;)<br /><br />I&nbsp;don't need theory to graduate since I'm in the teaching prep track, but I'm thinking I&nbsp;want to take it at some point. I&nbsp;find that sort of thing intriguing. On the other hand, I am going to have a heavy course load next year and that is a tough class... Unfortunate but I&nbsp;can take it when I&nbsp;get my MA. <br /><br />So the night before last after reading that really long poem I&nbsp;was intending to study for my Ethnic Lit midterm and compile my notes and quotes for the essays. I&nbsp;didn't know the poem assignment would take me until 2:30 in the morning so I didn't have time to study. I&nbsp;was glad I&nbsp;didn't waste too much time preparing because I&nbsp; ROCKED&nbsp;those essays, especially the first one. We only had a half hour per essay and I&nbsp;went over on the first one and made it perfect so the second one was rushed and I&nbsp;chose the easier, faster, less interesting, less in depth question for the second essay, but it was fine. I should still get an A because she knows I was running out of time and the class is for a bunch of non-majors so I&nbsp;get check-plusses on everything I&nbsp;turn in :)<br /><br />I&nbsp;also met two of my Psych students yesterday morning so they could take the quiz early since they'll be out of town on Friday. Super productive now that I'm better. I like this streak-- hopefully it won't end!&nbsp;I&nbsp;need to catch up on financial aid stuff, laundry and house stuff though.<br /><br /><strong>IDOL:</strong><br />Kris is safe &lt;3<br />I&nbsp;can't believe Allison was in the bottom 3<br />I can't believe the pressure they put Alexis under last night when she's performing 5 feet in front of them and they're talking about her and deciding her fate. Intense...<br />Why is Megan there?&nbsp;Sure she can sing ok but she could never be a touring artist because she can't perform at all...AT&nbsp;ALL!&nbsp;<br /><br />Yay for the sunshine, yay for a nice night at Tim's parents' last night! I&nbsp;hope Tim and I&nbsp;go hiking soon if it stays nice out. <br /><br />In other news, <strong>my sister (who is 17)&nbsp;is dating a 42 year old!</strong>&nbsp;We just found out that he was 42 NOT 22 as we had previously thought. hahaha... ew....hahaha...what is wrong with this guy?!&nbsp;He's such a loser...he doesn't have a driver's license, he hangs out with teenagers at the skate park everyday (where he met my sister), and he has a 2 year old little boy who is around drugs constantly because his roommates are all addicts... lovely... good job, Jordan! And she's talking about how he loves her and they're getting a place and getting married someday etc... Nothing anyone tells her will make a difference. She'll just have to figure things out for herself.&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel badly for her...I&nbsp;know her parents haven't really been there for her and she doesn't feel cared about and this guy provides that for her and boosts her self-image. She feels like an adult now...driving him everywhere, being smarter than someone, being in the &quot;step-mom&quot;&nbsp;role, etc. My mom went to the police and they said they don't do anything anymore unless the minor is under 16 because it's consentual and it happens so often. They just keep the report on file and it comes up when the guy gets in trouble for other things. Chances are, he'll be in trouble for other things. Apparently the police went to Jordan's dad's house to interview her at 6:30 the other morning because she's like a witness for one of the drug addict roomates or they were looking for one of them or something. <br />"

"event","In English class yesterday I&nbsp;could not stop smirking... It's a class on British Romanticism- the best era EVER spanning the late 1700s to 1800s (exact dates are not agreed upon by anyone). The authors include Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley, John Keats, Coleridge, Byron, etc. The professor was talking about the critics of the period calling the authors solipcistic (basically narcissistic and self-centered) and ahistorical because they didn't focus on struggles specific to their time and how they felt they were special, blessed poet-prophets who knew universal, transcendent, truths and wanted to share them with ordinary humans. They focused on the growth of the individual and sought deeper spirituality. They also thought they possessed greater empathy. YEP! The professor loves them, but he was saying how critics consider them egotistical assholes and I&nbsp;was sooooo thinking this is the same thing with Bono- people love him or hate him for the exact same paradox. And I&nbsp;know Bono says he's not like the Dali Lama; he's not MLK or Gandhi. I&nbsp;realize that.&nbsp;The reason that I place him on a pedastal is the INTENT and the acknowledgement that those ARE&nbsp;the role models. That is how we should aspire to be. Many people look up to Britney Spears and people who make a lot of money and aspire to be sports heros or CEOS or whatever. My biggest dream, for example, is to be a good mother. My second, to teach teenagers empathy so they can change the world one person at a time as I&nbsp;will. The ability to recognize what is good and valuable IS a virtue in and of itself. Bono and those guys have EARNED&nbsp;the right to a bit of arrogance. They aren't being rude about it, but they reflect on themselves and they KNOW&nbsp;that they are have the qualities everyone SHOULD&nbsp;strive for.

I&nbsp;love him, I&nbsp;love the Romantic poets, and I&nbsp;love me for thinking the exact same way&nbsp;:)

Go us... hopefully we can teach the idiotic general public to value the important things in life (spirituality, empathy, introspection, and critical thinking etc.)... just kidding... kind of...not really. I overstated it on purpose, but I&nbsp;still have the messianic complex.&nbsp; It's not that I&nbsp;give myself all the credit for being who I&nbsp;am-- I&nbsp;am so blessed to have the perspectives and beliefs that I&nbsp;do. Most people would put themselves first and would never even want the radical empathy that I&nbsp;possess. Here's another controversial statement:&nbsp;It takes an aggressive, independent person to get in most positions of power in the world. Neither of those qualities are &quot;good.&quot;&nbsp;People need others more than they would like to admit and the value that Americans place on independence is waaay too high. I'm not the only one who thinks this- read therapist Mary Pipher's work or Neil Postman's&nbsp;(another fabulous, pretensious SOB). Pipher argues that love is too often written off as co-dependency. Postman is beyond fabulous in everything he says. My fave quote from Postman is a very Romantic notion:&nbsp;&quot;Progress is the business of the heart, not the intellect.&quot;&nbsp;The imagination is higher than reason, it takes you further. As Bono wrote, &quot;A feeling [is] so much stronger than a thought.&quot; Reason does not account for what is right and wrong. Something could be logically the right thing to do and at the same time, the worst thing to do. 

WHEN&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;DO&nbsp;WHAT&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;MEANT&nbsp;TO&nbsp;DO&nbsp;AND&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;ACT&nbsp;IN&nbsp;SUPPORT&nbsp;OF&nbsp;LOVE, THE&nbsp;UNIVERSE&nbsp;WORKS&nbsp;IN&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;FAVOR. Absolutely, 100% Tim is agnostic and is still starting to belief me that I&nbsp;get special favors from God (or whatever you want to call him/her/it). It's pretty awesome. 

:P&nbsp;I don't think anyone besides Leslie reads this, but I&nbsp;know whoever else does is going to probably have some comments for me. 
Poorly written preach-fest over...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oh one more thing:&nbsp;American Idol... Ha!&nbsp;Not that that is an important thing in life... I&nbsp;enjoy music though and I&nbsp;enjoy watching people's dreams come true. The 16-year old with the reddish hair who sang the Heart song was the BEST&nbsp;by far last night.&nbsp;I&nbsp;also voted for Kris even though I&nbsp;liked his Hollywood week performance better. What is with people not knowing how to choose songs??!! I guess it would be hard because you'd be tempted to sing an all-time fave or pay homage to your favorite group, but you'd need to sing whatever fits your voice best. Then they are thinking too hard about like, what type of song the audience and America would want to hear on top of that. Songs that are truly good stand the test of time and they would get votes anyway but I&nbsp;get that if someone was attractive and sang a popular song like &quot;I'm Yours&quot;&nbsp;or something they'd probably get votes based on that too... rambling...I'm done. I'm trying to put off taking a shower. 

I love TAing for Family Psych. It's difficult to decide how much info to send students when they e-mail me asking questions about the quiz study guide. I&nbsp;probably give them too much specific info but it's better than not telling them enough and them being confused when they are making an effort to study the material and ask questions well before the quiz."

My current favorites are No Line on the Horizon (Loooove it!&nbsp;Love the &quot;oh oh oh-ohs&quot;&nbsp;and the mermaid references) and I'll Go Crazy if I Don't Go Crazy Tonight (despite the ridiculous lyrics), and Breathe for the end! At first listen, I&nbsp;was disappointed with this album. I think that always happens with U2 releases because everyone listens to it with such specific and grandiose expectations. Good, solid, quality, cohesive album. Some odd lyrics and psudo-rapping from Bono, but still very good. My least fave song is &quot;Stand Up&quot;. I&nbsp;realized when I&nbsp;was ranking the albums, that since I&nbsp;don't listen to full albums I&nbsp;never realized that there are usually some poor songs and some gems on each. &quot;No Line&quot;&nbsp;doesn't have any of my all-time favorite songs, but is overall far better than Zooropa etc.<br /><br />My favorite part of the new album lyrically is the following excerpt from Breathe:<br />&quot;We are people borne of sound<br />The songs are in our eyes<br />Gonna wear them like a crown<br />Walk out into the sunburnt street<br />Sing your heart out,<br />Sing my heart out<br />I&nbsp;found grace inside a sound<br />I found grace that's all I&nbsp;found<br />Now I&nbsp;can breathe&quot;<br /><br />This is obviously more for me to see how these change over time!&nbsp;:)<br /><br />"

"event","<p><strong>&quot;House&quot;&nbsp;and </strong><strong>&quot;24&quot;:&nbsp;</strong>&quot;House&quot; was good last night. Thirteen and Foreman are not a good couple. He is really struggling with her bisexuality and he demeans her a lot. Their relationship seems largely based on sex at this point. &quot;24&quot; was ok... next weeks episode looks better. It looks like Tony will be involved more from here on. :) Jack is a little too one-dimensional this season it seems. I would have thought he would have been able to have a bit of a sensitive side when dealing with Renee', but he just screams at everyone like they are terrorists. And he and Tony need to have a scene where they deal with the past because they were so close and it is odd to hear Jack constantly being mean to him without showing him struggling with the situation at all.<br /><br /><strong>Academy Awards:&nbsp;</strong>Points to Sean Penn and the &quot;Milk&quot;&nbsp;screenwriting for bringing up Prop 8 and the need for equality!&nbsp;I&nbsp;love Sean Penn. I thought it was neat that they had past winners from each category talk a bit about each nominee as opposed to simply reading off a list of names. It conveyed a feeling of more comradery and respect-- like the work they did was substantial in a bigger way and a contribution to their craft as a whole. <br /><br /><strong>Ranting:</strong>&nbsp; Tim's Dad decided that since he doesn't care about the speeches that he would turn the volume off after he saw who won...without asking anyone else in the house if they minded...who does that?!&nbsp;I&nbsp;heard about half of the adorable and heartfelt speech the Indian musician gave for &quot;Slumdog Millionaire.&quot; Something about always choosing love in his life and history being handed to him... I get that a lot of times actors just go up and read a list of names they feel obligated to thank but when winners are completely overwhelmed with joy and feel affirmed that their life's work has paid off and their dreams have come true and speak from their soul, why would anyone NOT&nbsp;want to see that and share in that?? It was so odd to me...a lot of things he does are odd to me, but I'm dealing with it. I&nbsp;don't want to start any issues and I&nbsp;know that his family deals by ignoring things even when members are hurting, but the rudeness is unbearable sometimes. He also shushed me and Tim for talking once during House, but I&nbsp;can't even count how many times he talks when we are trying to hear something. To me personally, I&nbsp;don't care as much, but when I&nbsp;hear it directed towards Michelle, or worse, her boyfriend, I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;should be standing up for them because I&nbsp;know uncomfortable I felt when I&nbsp;first started going over there. Cathy said Michelle went to get James for dinner and John asked why and Cathy said, &quot;Michelle wants us to get to know him better&quot; and John says &quot;Great&quot;&nbsp;in this horrible sarcastic tone and walks out to the garage. During dinner, he acts like he is not even there and just talks to Tim the whole time instead of making him feel welcome. James may not even notice, but I&nbsp;know I&nbsp;was hurt by it in the beginning so deeply so it bothers me more... Then his daughter reaches out to involve him in her life and says, &quot;You should show James your models in the garage.&quot;&nbsp;and he just kind of made a sound and kept eating...Ummm....?????? I'm conflicted about whether I&nbsp;should talk to Michelle or leave it alone... because I&nbsp;don't want her to over-react, but I&nbsp;don't want&nbsp;her and James to feel alone with it either because I&nbsp;love her. <br /><br /><strong>Annnd back to the Academy Awards:</strong>&nbsp; Hugh Jackman is not a singer. Why was Beyonce there? Why wasn't Bill Maher's film &quot;Religulous&quot;&nbsp;nominated anyway??&nbsp;I haven't seen it yet but it looks thought-provoking and ground breaking.<br /><br /><strong>School:&nbsp;</strong>I'm freaking out a little because we have a paper due next week and we don't have the prompts yet and I'm always at work when I'm not at school. There's going to be some long nights coming up...I&nbsp;got lucky with my Ethnic Lit. class though-- it's the easiest English class I've ever had.&nbsp;It's required for GE&nbsp;too so coming to it with my background makes my in-class writing and comments seem far superior and I get great feedback on everything. Lighter reading load too!<br /><br /><strong>Tattoos and a bit at the end about the new U2 album: </strong>I want on my back under my neck in the center. I can't wait to get it, but I'm having trouble deciding because there are so many lyrics, quotes, and words that mean a lot to me. I&nbsp;definitely only want one though because Tim hates them and I&nbsp;don't want them to look trashy. I either want&nbsp;&quot;We get to carry each other&quot; or &quot;Love is a temple, Love the higher law&quot;&nbsp;from the song &quot;One&quot;&nbsp;or a mermaid holding a heart or the word &quot;Transcend&quot;&nbsp;with angel wings on each side of it. I&nbsp;like &quot;Love is my religion&quot;&nbsp;or &quot;Love one another&quot;&nbsp;too but I really want to stick with a song. The only other lyric I was thinking of was &quot;Set your spirit free&quot;&nbsp;from &quot;Bad&quot;&nbsp;but I am drawn more to the options from &quot;One.&quot; Another ruled out option was &quot;Gypsy&quot;&nbsp;with a heart overlapping the end of it as a tie-in to &quot;Who's Gonna Ride your Wild Horses&quot;&nbsp;but the other choices are soooo much better. I&nbsp;thought the new album would give me something perfect, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;have it and there really aren't very strong lyrics on No Line... I love the lyrics at the end of &quot;Breathe&quot;&nbsp;but I&nbsp;wouldn't want them tattoed on me. I'll put them on here just because I&nbsp;love them and then you'll know what I'm takling about:&nbsp;&quot;We are the people borne of sound, the songs are in our eyes, gonna wear them like a crown. Walk out, into the sunburned street. Sing your heart out, sing my heart out. I&nbsp;found grace inside a sound, I found grace it's all I found. Now I can breathe.&quot;&nbsp;Too bad the beginning of the song has to be weird psuedo-rap about cockatoos and ju ju men. LOL.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

The fans on the forum often abbreviate the album and song titles ie: ""ATYCLB"" for ""All that you can't leave behind,"" ""Htdaab"" for ""How to dismantle an atomic bomb"" etc. So Tim starts reading the abbreviated versions aloud like ""I really like Htdaab!"" as a joke and then he goes ""I loved Zooropa"" and so I informed him that ""Zooropa"" is an ACTUAL album rather than an abbreviation. HAHA.

	-->
	</style> <p align=""left"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">&quot;I have come to believe that religion is limiting. I have always been a seeker of spiritual fulfillment and felt the presence of a higher power in my life, thus I identify strongly as a spiritual individual. My relationship with God is an important part of my life though I do not belong to a particular faith. Most of my beliefs could be classified as Taoist, though I have read numerous spiritual texts and taken several world religions and mythology courses which continue to shape and expand my notions of spirituality. <strong>Each text has something important to offer and contains, in my opinion, the essence of God filtered by the ideologies of the authors' communities</strong>. At the heart of all of these faiths-- once stripped of the symbols and rituals-- is one basic principle: love one another. Religion too often gets in the way of its own essential rule.&quot;<br /><br />The next day I&nbsp;am flipping through my Romantic literature anthology in search of assigned William Blake poems and come across an essay by Blake entitled &quot;All Religions Are One&quot;&nbsp;so I&nbsp;skimming it and find, <strong>&quot;The religions of all Nations are derived from each Nation's different reception of the Poetic Genius</strong>, which is every where called the Spirit of Prophecy.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />While Blake's &quot;Poetic Genius&quot;&nbsp;is man because in his opinion, man is God and man created God, for me the best affirmations come from those whom I admire echoing my ideas. The Romantic writers of the 1700's frequently echo and affirm my ideas. I am grateful to know that I&nbsp;hold the same notions as these great thinkers who are widely admired--by the type of individuals I&nbsp;gravitate towards anyway!&nbsp;The Romantic writers consistantly affirm my beliefs and priorities and all of my other role models have similar ideas (eg. Bono, Neil Postman). I wonder if Neil Postman was influenced by the Romantics considering he wrote things such as, &quot;Progress is the business of the heart, not the intellect.&quot;&nbsp;&lt;3<br /><br />I love me... LOL. No I&nbsp;know I am blessed and I all of the supposed &quot;coincidences&quot;&nbsp;in my life are meant to be. I don't believe in coincidences... just fate. Off to home depot and then a movie later tonight. We're either going to see &quot;The Reader&quot;&nbsp;or &quot;Slumdog Millionaire.&quot;&nbsp; Tim hates going to the movies, but he was given passes by his co-workers so I'll get to go see some good films-- finally!&nbsp;<br /><br />Added later:&nbsp;<br />I&nbsp;also really want to see &quot;Good&quot;&nbsp;though I&nbsp;don't think it's in theaters anymore, &quot;Doubt,&quot;&nbsp;&quot;Milk,&quot; &quot;The Changeling,&quot;&nbsp;&quot;The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,&quot;&nbsp;and possibly &quot;Revolutionary Road.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;finished reading Blake's &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot;&nbsp;and I&nbsp;was really not impressed... anyone could have written those poems. They were surprisingly simple. I&nbsp;should wait before passing judgement though as I&nbsp;have yet to read &quot;Songs of Experience&quot;&nbsp;which are said to contrast with the aforementioned collection. <br /><br />OH! In other news, I&nbsp;just saw the new video for &quot;Get on Your Boots.&quot;&nbsp;I'm not crazy about the song, but I&nbsp;know it will be a fun one live and the video is cool. It's not technically released or finished, but it was leaked to YouTube in what seems like a fairly complete version. I really like it. It is unlike any of their other videos and it's new and fresh. It's great to have new material from the guys!&nbsp;Even more exciting:&nbsp;I&nbsp;heard an alternate version of &quot;No&nbsp;Line on the Horizon&quot;&nbsp;will be on the single when it is released for purchase. So yay for more new songs.<br /><br />Also in music news:&nbsp;The Fray's new album hits stores this February. I loveeeee their music!<br />&nbsp;</p><p align=""left"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">I'm going to make some pasta and get ready for the movie!&nbsp;:) I'm excited... hopefully Tim will enjoy it as well.

"event","The final episode of ""The Montel Williams Show"" aired today. I can not even begin to explain how many lives he has touched, changed, saved, and inspired. Despite being afflicted with MS, Montel has continued to change the world one person at a time for the past seventeen years. His interviews increased awareness on important topics and Montel remained true to his beliefs no matter how controversial or unpopular. I hope someone out there will be able to fill his shoes and do as much good as he has done. I can only aspire to make a fraction of the positive change in the world as Montel has made. I used to say I would do something that would give me the opportunity to come face to face with him and thank him for all he has done and make him proud for the good I was doing in society. Now, that opportunity is gone, but I will continue to look to him as a role model. Thank you Montel for being a light in this increasingly dark world. 

:) 

Montel's show will be missed... I have to admit I cried when the lights went out in the studio at the end of the finale though I can't exactly explain why. I hope Montel will still be around in some other genre helping and inspiring others. oxoxo
&nbsp;

In other news, I should be preparing for finals since this is my only day off. I got a little distracted... I'll go try to be productive. Oh! And my&nbsp; teacher wrote really nice things on my papers and said that my papers were ""Consistently among the best in the class"" and ""A pleasure to read"" and ""excellent"". Yay! It always feels great to be recognized by individuals with PhDs as being a excellent writer. Hopefully I won't let that skill go to waste. I applied for a tutoring position in the SSU writing center, but I felt like I could have said more in my interview so we'll see...

I'm learning to play guitar and I absolutely love it! My acoustic is gorgeous and I can't wait to have more time to practice.

I'm really excited about a few things. First of all, I decided that once I graduate, I'm going to spend the majority of that summer in India working in an orphanage before I come home to start teaching. Tim will be able to come with me too because since it's not through the Peace Corps, there isn't a two year commitment. I can chose between 1 week and several months. :) I've always wanted to adopt a child from India so now since I'm going to spend some time there and learn some of the language and culture, I feel like that will be good since I'll have some understanding of her culture and homeland. Since I found out about a few organizations where you can volunteer in orphanages in India, Africa, etc., I've felt so relieved because I was so conflicted about whether or not I could do Peace Corps because of the two year committment, but at the same time I really wanted to do something of that nature. Now I can!

Also, I got my first guitar! It is gorgeous and Michael is giving me lessons. I wish I had a bit more time to practice, but it's been a lifelong dream and every time I learn a chord and it sounds right, it is just a beautiful, fulfilling feeling. I really am happy that I am pursuing things that I had been putting off for so long. I've learned C,G, D, E, Em, A, Am so far! 

I have a writing exam tomorrow at SSU that all students have to take prior to graduating... it seems easy except that I am a huge rough draft person, I can't just sit and write something... So time is going to be the only issue.

It would be cute on the back of my neck so it only shows when my hair's up in a ponytail! I hate needles and people touching my neck though so we'll see...

Memorable quotes from yesterday:
""So are these ones like still under construction?"" -Tim looking at the Metreon map with #s like 2030 which corresponded to store names. He thought they wouldn't be ready until the year 2030 etc... HAHAHA.

Honestly, my eyes teared up and I thought maybe he had to stop cuz his MS worsened or something. I love him and he has changed so many peoples lives! I hope to do as much good in the world as he has. Apparently after looking into it further, he is still doing other projects, just not the talk show anymore. I will miss it, but look forward to his new projects.

I have my first review at work today and I'm kinda nervous... I love my job, but I don't deal as well as I should with criticism. School starts again tomorrow!"

"event","David Cook rocked Idol tonight and got my vote. I really liked him last week too!<br /><br />I used to like Michael Johns, but after the last two performances he's been demoted in my ranking.<br /><br />Danny Noriega is the most entertaining person ever. He probably won't win, but he'll for sure end up hosting for E! or some type of show.<br /><br /><br />Going to bed finally! Long day.<br /><br />Ps. James Waller signed my <i>Becoming Evil</i> book today after the lecture. :)"

Her being in a relationship has given us some common ground and she has someone to come to for big sister type questions. I'm really pleased with this... we are still really different and there are some obviously not so pleasant qualities that she still has, but I don't live with her anymore so I get to enjoy her much more. :)"

I asked him why and he said ""Well...because you're so soft"" and I laughed and asked for a different reason. He said ""You're beautiful"" and I said ""Aww thanks. I don't feel beautiful all the time"" He said ""You are SOO beautiful and if anybody says you're not, they are CRAZY.""

"event","We're going to the cabin tomorrow through Sunday! I'm so excited because it's the first big family get together since my grandparents moved to Hawaii. Auntie, Bob, Michael, Leanna, and Jordan are coming too. I wish Tim wanted to go, though instead of feeling like I'm making him go... it's really been weighing heavily on me and it's hard not to be hurt or sarcastic to him... I would do anything for him and it usually feels like he just does whatever he has planned regardless of what I think, but when I want to do something he isn't too crazy about it's either a no or that he thinks I should go alone. I want to share it with him. It's important to me and even if he doesn't want to go, shouldn't he want to go because it makes me happy and he KNOWS it's important to me?? Sorry for the ranting...I hope he ends up having a good time. Last time we went to the cabin it was wonderful. 

Off to take a quick shower before Idol comes on then I have some hw!"

"event","&nbsp;As much as I love my job, it felt so pointless being there tonight. There were 2 customers and I had ZERO sales. That's how slow it was. I just felt like I could've been sent home to do homework. All my sales numbers were looking great for the week and now they're going to be averaged with a zero... that sucks. I wanted the numbers to show how well I really did this week. 

On Idol, the girls weren't as good as the guys overall. I really like Brooke White, Alaina (?), and Ramiele&nbsp; still. I thought Simon was a little harsh on some of them, especially Kady, and I usually say the same things as Simon. 

I am probably going to the cabin this weekend with everybody! I don't think Tim and I are going to ski or snowboard this time, just for financial reasons. I actually don't even know if Tim is going to go this time. It's just a weekend getaway, family trip. I'm glad Auntie is going; I think it will bring her and Mom closer finally! 

I'm so happy I have off work until Monday! Lots to do homework wise though. 

Shower time then maybe I can get some sleep tonight.

(Ps. Tim is great, I love him!)"

I'm staying up to watch Idol and then taking a shower and going to sleep. I'll be tired in the morning, but I really wanted to see Idol tonight. 

(So, I heard his laugh in the coffee shop and immediately knew it was him and looked up. He didn't come say hi, but I don't think he saw me anyway...that's what I'll tell myself. I wish I knew what I did to lose him as a friend...)"

I went to work feeling fresh and motivated. I ended up doubling my sales goal and having a higher ADS than anyone there! Whoo!&nbsp; Basically, I totally kicked butt today and I'm proud and my manager better praise me next time I work with her (cuz u know how I need that)! ;)

I'm off to do my grammar hw and then sleep for a long, but probably great day, at SSU tomorrow.

"event","I can't believe I stayed home from class today! I stayed home last Thursday from the same class (Pedagogical Grammar). It happens to be my hardest class and I need to be there, but I'm exhausted. I was at SSU yesterday from 6:30am-4pm, brought a change of clothes to go straight to work, then came home at 7:30pm and did hw until 11:45. I can't do that 4 days in a row... A part of me agrees with everyone that ""other people do it"" and that my situation isn't really that unmanageable, but when I wake up in the morning feeling as tired as I do and looking ahead thinking I won't be home til night time, it feels overwhelming. I got a 3.9 GPA last semester because I had classes two days a week and a day in between to sleep and do hw. I wish I could expect the same or better GPA this time, but it seems out of reach, especially now. Now I can't miss another day of class, I can't turn in the assignments I've missed, etc. I am SO afraid that I will let myself give up like I did during my first semester at SSU. I love school and I could be in school forever and wouldn't mind. I'm also an excellent student, but my schedule is overwhelming right now. I need to be stronger... Tim is being really supportive. He won't let me work less, but he said to let him know if there's something he can do to help and he made dinner for me the last few nights! He is so wonderful! <br /><br />I talked to my Grandpa Jan yesterday, who I hadn't called in a while. He hurt my feelings, but he probably didn't even realize that he did. I only see him once a year if that and the whole time he said how great and bright and everything Tim was and how good he is for me. EXCUSE ME?! He never got a 3.9 in college. Just because his job is better paid than teaching and viewed as superior in society doesn't mean that he is smarter or better and I wish people would think for themselves and not think what society wants them to think. Don't misunderstand me- I am so happy for Tim that he is doing what he has always wanted to do and doing so well with the bank. We are smart in different ways and he knows calculus and investing etc., but he can't analyze texts and think deeply anywhere near the level that I do. So my Grandpa goes on and on about how Tim should get his MA because since he's so bright, why stop his education now because it would be a waste. I said I didn't think he wanted to get his MA since he is doing what he went to school for already, but that he might get a certification through his job. I then told him that I was intending to get my MA since I enjoy school and then I could teach at the college level (community colleges). He sort of shrugged it off and continued on about Tim and said that he was talking to the wrong person and to make sure I tell Tim he said ""hi"". Ew. I didn't eat lunch so that I could talk to him... that was a bad decision. lol. I wish teachers were more respected in society. <br /><br /><br />In completely unrelated news, ""The Jane Austen Book Club"" is such a cute movie. I admit I have a <i>slight </i>bias because Hugh Dancy is in it and I think he's the most gorgeous person in the world. :)"

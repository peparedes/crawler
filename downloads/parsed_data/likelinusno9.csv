"event","Our drumline is really going to hell.. last practice we lost four people (our captain of the drumline/snare player, keyboardist, tenor, and none other then... ta da! that kid that raped me of my bass drum spot! surprise!) and there is talk of another one of our snare players quitting.. if he quits, its a given that his girlfriend who is on the cymbal line will quit as well. we started with like, 30-35 people in our percussion ensemble and now we have 7 drummers and like, 13 pit people. today i really gave it to justin.. after he joined the drumline for outdoor, came to about 2-3 practices and bitched at every one, disapeared for 2 months, then quit making him responsible for cutting the cymbal line 3 weeks before our first performance screwing me, mallory, and the rest of the unit over he had the nerve to try out for bass drum.. then, when he gets the bass drum spot that is in demand he decides once again to screw over the marching unit and quit after about 3-4 practices (hey now.. the time period he stays dedicated for is getting slightly longer). he completely raped me of my posisitons- not once but twice- and im fucking sick of it. needless to say, i gave him a piece of my mind today and if he trys to pull something like this ever again i can garentee that he will be pissing in a bag for a week."

So, I decided the hell with her and went back to cleaning my room. Then, I came down for something and my sister was like ""you're avoiding everything"", or some stupid shit like that.

"event","This week was kinda irritating and busy.. I finished the sludge test (first successful group of 2001 to finish it, yay), but my partner, Andrew (he plays snare on the drumline) and I argued about everthing. We screwed up the metals badly and ended up getting a B.
Thursday was the winter concert. The night before I had practice with my bando minions. During this one song I had the music to the ""glockenspiel chimes"" that I got on monday. I assumed that the ""glockenspiel chimes"" referred to the chimes, rather then the chimes and bells so I spent the whole time trying to play eighth notes on chimes in cut time until Zach informed me of this. Fun, fun. I screwed up a lot during the concert which kinda sucked and uh.. yeah. Alex like, fainted, and had to leave early.
Friday I had a party type thingie with Michaela and Boobi, which was kinda cool. Yesterday I had band practice and went shopping. Thats about the outline of my week as of now. Today I'm planning to get some cleaning done and lay around and do nothing."

"event","hey Jolly, I have a question.. for indoor, do you have a drumset? I overheard Brendan saying they need one. No? Well.. I have a fairly new 5 piece Pearl Export set at my home that I will be more then happy to donate for indoor season. of course.. there is a small price to pay. how does the possiblity of Seth maybe playing set for half of the show and I play for the other half or something? It would make our percussion ensemble look superior because I'm sure not too many drumlines do this and it will show that we are so talented that we have two set drummers that can run off and play other instruments rather then set, which is a big enough instrument on it's own, no problem. plus, it will help you, it will help me, and it will prolly help seth.. i say that it will help you because seth and i already have knowledge of drumset so you dont have to go through the trouble of teaching us a lot more about mallet related instruments and reading music. it will help me and prolly seth for the same reasons- because we (or atleast i) are primarily set players. this means that i will feel a lot more confident on set, will be more willing and more in a positive mood at practice, will have less questions, will hopefully need less help, and more then likely i will enjoy it a lot more. if i have any trouble, i can go home and practice and it will do me a lot of good becuase i'll have a set at home and a private instructor i see every week, that, in fact, teaches PW drumline.  it wont be like me attempting to practice mariamba at home on a piano, where i know where all of the notes are on the piano, then i get to the mariamba and the notes are much more spaced out, i have to worry about the sticking, and i have to be able to play it with good strokes at a good speed. i can tell you right now that i have been only playing for 11 months and that seth has been more then likely playing longer then me. this would mean that he is prolly more experienced, so when we alternate even if i get to play just 1 song and seth gets the more complicated parts i will still be content.but even at that, if i have any trouble i will definately practice at home or go to my drum instructor before you make decisions like that. please consider my idea- when i was first put on cymbals and no body in my section, not even the instructor, showed up but me half of the time and i spent many hours laying around doing nothing then was cut into pit i sure as hell didn't stay there becuase i enjoyed it- in fact i dreaded and despised it! i only stayed there because everyone kept telling me to deal with it- i will get somewhere eventually and that i have to get through the crap first to get through the glory. some of the people on the drumline, from the looks of it, got right to the glory and never experienced the crap.. i would appreciate it if i could have a taste of the glory rather then be thrown back into the beginning

btw... Lizzie has an idea... two set drummers that switched in the middle of a show would look very professional, wouldn't you agree? Not only can the set drummers play set, but that shows that they're multitalented and can play more then just set (set alone has a lot to it). Not only that, but I think i overheard brendan talking about them needing a set... i have a brand new pearl export set. that and im taking private drum lessons. that and i guess it is safe to say im primarily a set drummer.. so.. if i play in pit i should make the most of it and try this one out with jolly, eh? if worse comes to worse... my sister has a bass guitar and... ::kicks myself::"

"event","I just don't fucking get how things work out. Everything that happens elevates me just enough to bring me down.. I get put on cymbal line, cymbal line gets ignored; cymbal line gets somewhere and I spend a weekend learning my music, cymbal line gets cut and I goto the pit hellhole; Bobby tells me to play cymbals for Star Spangled Banner, I play cymbals and feel on the top of the world- until I am informed that all the upperclassmen hate me for playing cymbals; I am told to play cymbals for the parade and practice my part extensively, when I get to the parade grounds Zach rips the cymbals out of my hands in a blink of an eye... and most recently: I waste 45 hours a week in pit, work my hardest, try not to bitch and complain too much about it just to try to score a spot on drumline- I take home my cymbals and practice doing the iron cross every day for a month, develop cymbal bruises and ""track marks"", my sister helps me with marching and some technique, my private drum instructor helps me play in time, I work my motherfuckin ass off just to be given one cheap ass shot of making cymbal line and I get fuckin cut. I can't begin to explain how infuriated I am.. I understand Sutcliff has to do what is best for the unit, but how can he base it on one practice? Shouldn't he atleast give us the chance to fix what we did wrong to show exactly how hard working and determined we are to correct what we can? To make matters worse, he only hung around to see us (cymbal players) do technique related excercises- the same ones that I was hoping to practice on. He didn't care apparently about observing us play eighth notes in split parts or do Accent Taps. I'm just so pissed off.. throughout practice I kept reassuring myself and thinking ""Relax. You'll get another shot next week. Bring home your cymbals, practice technique."" I honestly think I would be able to live up to his expectations if I was just given the chance to improve upon what I had trouble with. After all, isn't music about improvements and progression? You can't teach someone new techniques at a practice, see them struggle with it, and determine them useless before they even have the chance to practice on their own. In fact, it would probably be better to let them practice so that the next practice their improvements will (hopefully) show and it will show exactly how determined they are to play that instrument and exactly how far they intend to push theirselves. After all, Sutcliff said in the week of championships that he would rather ""have a drumline that works hard and sucks then a drumline that is lazy but very good"". If he *really* thinks that, then I guess it is safe to say that he would give me a second chance *reguardless* of how much I previous sucked before. The fact that I was nervous as fuckin hell (nervous meaning I was deathly afraid that I would be cut after all of my hard work and dedication)and sick (altho it was mainly yesterday, I still got no sleep tuesday night and felt lightheaded all day wensday). I don't know what is going to happen next, but I know for a fact that I don't think I can handle being in pit again..."

Some of the people that are trying out for cymbal line don't even seem remotely intrested in really playing, no names mentioned. In fact, I recall me literally pouncing on cymbals when I had the chance to play them for the parade, then someone else who is signed up for cymbals (no names mentioned) didn't want to play cymbals, and when Sutcliff told him to play he gave him an additude about it (hope to god this person doesn't read my livejournal now.. just simple facts, nothing bad about it, right?) and obviously didn't want to play. It was like for him playing was a burden, meanwhile it was a great privilage for me and I appreciated it altho it didn't last long at all.  Hope to god I make cymbals..."

"event","Busy weekend.. went back to havinga  life again, now that bands mostly over. on saturday i went to south street and bought  a dead sexy two video set nin video thingie. then, i saw laser radiohead and tool at the franklin institute.. laser radiohead was awesome, during paranoid andriod they had a man create a little robot. then, someone shot the robot and it died and it was so depressing.. during high and dry they also had a dude on a mountain that turned into a bird, it was so rawkin. and during the national anthym it was really abstract with lizards running around and lots of pac man and whatnot. tool wasn't as good tho, not as impacting... the next day was the hatboro parade, the event that i couldn't stop talking about to my friends and family all week because i thought i was playing cymbals. i worked hard with my marching in time and fixed the part in the song were playing that has a slide choke with two hit hats following. so anyway, i walk into our parade area all happy and cheerful when bobby informs me that i was the only person that brought my cymbals. before i know it, zach pops out of nowhere and took my cymbals, which pissed me off to high hell. i tried talking to him, but he went off about his mother and shit like that.. i ended up handing out candy to the children, which sucked becuase at one point i got attacked by so many kids that i ended up about a 1/2 mile behind our marching unit. i couldn't even see them anymore, and had to run for about 5 minutes to catch up. i had a shitty fuckin time. i swear to god- i dont care what happens, nothing is stopping me from playing cymbals for the disney parade. i was/still am really bitter about the way zach acted.. you dont go up to someone and punish them like that because they were responsible and caring enough to bring their cymbals with them. i dont understand why i have so much bad luck with the unit- i get ignored for 2 months on cymbals. once the cymbal line starts to get somehwere,i take a weekend to learn all of my music and that tuesday they cut it.. then, i got put in pit (need i say more?) and when im supposed to play cymbals for the parade im screwed over.  plus, i prolly wont make cymbal line for indoor. that is so fucked up.. seriously, i swear to god im damned or something."

Today, i grabbed meggie's chapionshit jacket and wore it for about a total of 3 minutes and shes getting all pissy over me, saying that im going to get one of my own but i dont deserve her jacket. 1. if her jacket was that symbolic, she would leave it lying around. 2. theres an upperclassmen that wears a championship jacket every freakin night that never won a championship 3. even if we win championship jackets, if she based everything on this level i sure as hell do not deserver one. i wasn't given any parts whatsoever of signifigance towards the sound. 4. all of the band mommies constantly wear championship jackets and last time i checked none of them played in the unit.
i swear to god, i hate this stupid shit.. only two more performances left in the mummy and it is gone forever.. everyone always says indoor is so much better... and when taking a casual walk back to the stadium, i cannot count on guardos that are juniors getting their panties in a bunch over the idea that me and about 41 other freshman are in front of me."

"event","The Tool concert was excelent... when we first got there the security was insane tho- my sister and i had to park across broad street, the main parking lot was only about 40% capacity with the area cloest to the venue blocked off, and they would allow spikes in the building.. my sister shoved her spikes down her shirt, but my spikes had a metal band to it so i had to unscrew each spike and put it in my shoe. the opener band was santos...they were like nu metal + avant garde with faith no more's lead singer and slayer's drummer. they were...well...bad. i tried to be open minded about them, but after a while it just got...bad when they dissed weezer.. they were like ""hey, weezer was here last night- dont boo us"". The thing about them is that they seem to have plenty of talent.. they just were...bad.. and abused it. around 9, the venue got dark as the two screens in the back of the stage showed the swirling lateralus logo.. everyone grew quiet as Danny Carey starting jamming as Justin followed the rhythem with his strings.. Maynard James Keenan, nothing more then a dark silioutte against the screen which now showed pictures of fetal matter came out and started singing his lines in a mournful tone as the lights changed to shades of blue and green. i am pretty sure they went right to stinkfist and eulogy after that.. the lighting changed and the screens turned off, now everythign was dark except for a light with the shadows of a fan coming from the back of Danny's set. eulogy was played in a much longer version, lasting prolly around 10 minutes. around here came eon blue apolcalypse, opening up to the patient which was simply amazing. Then, they did 46 & 2 and pushit somehwere... then, they went to schism, which was real fuckin cool.. towards the middle of the song (3:20 to be exact) a nude coturtionist went on stage and walked around on his toes and finger tips with his head dangling.. it was real fuckin cool. there was a break in here, im pretty sure.. then they went to parabol and parabola.. before they did parabol, two nude cotortionists (i think 1 was female and the other was male) climbed to the top of the stage and hung upside down by their ankles for about 15 minutes which was fuckin amazing. during parabola the pit just went wild with emotion as these red lights focus in on the cotortionists and the spinning lateralus symbol of the human body was played on the screens. the contortionists were moving around wildly, as if in agony, and sucking in their stomaches so that their ribcage was showing. Then, they did reflection followed by triad... beautiful songs... after that Maynard crept out of the shadows and said hi to us. then he said ""music is for healing"" and hugged his bandmates. After that, they went into opiate.. then Maynard said some beautiful things.. ""no matter what kind of day you are having, whether it is bad, good, indifferent.. never forget how you feel right now... take those feelings and turn it into something positve in this world"". they did lateralis and thanked the crowd one last time.. amazing band, their show and Maynard's words i will never forget. i still have my waterproof pit wristband on- im going to see how long it will last. 

PARABOL
So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
This one, this form I hold now.
Embracing you, this reality here,
This one, this form I hold now, so
Wide eyed and hopeful.
Wide eyed and hopefully wild.

We barely remember what came before this precious moment,
Choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside...
This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in
This body makes me feel eternal. All this pain is an illusion."

Lasst friday the football game was hellish. In fact, it was so bad we made Julie cry (no lie), Jolly left us, and i fucked up more times then i can count. oh well, atleast we had a kickass time on saturday- came in first with a score of 74.something, and won the marching, guard, percussion ( \m/ ), and overall music awards. i saw my old cymbal instructor, doug, for the first time since july. i didn't reconize him at first, it was kinda strange. he was performing with temple as a snare player (they were there as exhibition, which was cool.  who knows, maybe now that i am getting somewhere i wont quit after all. 
the dude that was supposed to sell me tool tix backed out, which sucks ass. he told me about the seller that sold him his tickets and linked me to the ebay bid. my sister currently has the high bid, at... 1 dollar! wow.
my sister also siad that she will prolly dye my hair black next sunday, which is real fuckin cool.. i've wanted to dye my hair black for the longest time but my mom never let me and well... next week she will be down the shore if you catch my drift. if she says anything, i'll just go ""what do you mean by my hair being black?! your senile, i dyed it brown!"". lol, cant argue with that, can she?"

i feel like shit now, emotionally drained and just fuckin damaged. dont know or understand what i am doing anymore or why, don't know what to love and what to burn. the highs in my life are real fuckin high and the lows are deeper then you can imagine and whenever something irritates me i cannot flush it out of my head. try to be nice, but nothing good comes from that so fuck it. so many things i have done out of hate and ignorance and i want to change that and become closer before it all slips away. shouldn't be taking things so gravely when they are so insignificant, yet still i feel as if nothing really matters anymore
judge me and erase me all you want. fuck off if you hate me for reasons beyond my understanding. if you have shit to say, say it to my face- dont be a coward. treat me like shit if it is justified and i will accept what you say, treat me like shit for no reason and you will just build a wall of more hate. why is it so simple for people to focus on the negative things that i have done when i try my hardest to brush the negatives out of my mind?
hate that bullshit that occurs in your life that you try to hide and push away until it kicks you in the ass and whenever you see t hem you feel sick. maybe im just too fuckin complicated"

"event","Amy8585 [10:40 PM]:  lots of people, out of the 9 of us had wanted to play cymbals and were never told we were allowed... and when sid wanted to play we couldn't figure out why a freshman was and the senior wasn't Amy8585 [10:42 PM]:  no, but why she got the part before it was offered to the upperclassmen makes no sense also 

that is so fucked up, narrow minded and egocentric, cant they think about anything else? it isn't my fault- the second I walked into the band wing bobby came up to me and was like ""guess what? you were chosen to play cymbals"". it cannot be that big of a deal, or else i would imagine that someone would say something rather then hold a grudge against me and treat me like shit for the next week. if they wanted to play cymbals so badly then why didn't they join the cymbal line? atleast by being in the pit they get to play what they (obviously) love, why else would they join repeatively? I don't- like i mentioned before i do not even get to be in the section that i want to be in, let alone instrument. i was on the top of the world when i was playing cymbals for star spangled banner but then everyone brought me down..
 no point in being mad at someone unless the person is aware of the reason.. i swear, this is such bullshit. i should quit right here, but it would be such a waste of time considering that i spent my whole summer working my ass off with the drumline. even tho that went to waste, my practice after that with the pit didn't. not like i can stand up to any of these people- im sure there is a code of honor against a freshman trying to get back their dignity from upperclassmen somewhere"

"event","Well, today I was online 3 when I got an IM from someone. Turns out he was the Deffan that I have been e-mailing about the Tweeter Center show. We start talking, when he offers me two PIT TICKETS to see Tool at the FU Center for face value \m/        After discussing it with Meggie-Bear, we decided when the guy gets the tickets that we will meet him and exchange to make sure it is authentic. Now, I just have to discuss the idea with... my mom...

Today, I arrived an hour early and Sid stuck to his word. In fact, he was really helpful and uh.. helped me learn Dup Rolls. Goody. I still can't play mallets for shit- lifes a bitch and then you die. Meryl informed me that there are a ton of people apparently trying out for cymbal line and that I prolly won't make the cut for indoor, which sucks ass. It's bad enough that I cannot be in the section of my choice for outdoor (let alone instrument of choice) and the idea of people that are plently content with their outdoor season spots (they cannot want cymbals that badly considering that they didn't go out for it for outdoor)yet still they have to take *my* potential dream spot for indoor of cymbals irritates me. Then again, of course they will prolly be a few bass drum parts open- I can dream, can't I?

Today was so weird, I kept getting these really quick (I mean, lasting a second if that) dizzy spells that would randomly just pop out. They seemed to be strongest around loud noises, as I learned at band, and it's irritating as hell. My mom keeps saying that it is because I am not eating enough or something altho I think I eat plenty. It is prolly from lack of sleep- getting up at 5 am and going to sleep at 10 pm is prolly taking a toll finally."

"event","I wanna play my fuckin drums cos I feel energetic but I won't wanna piss off my neighbors :/

Today I waited for about 15 min at the school for Sid to show- he enver showed! Me being me, I was pissed as hell and jumped to conclusions. Apparently, when he came at 6 for normal practice he said that I apparently fucked up and said that it was supposed to be on thrus. I suck, lol.

We got thru the ballard- I get to play some rawkin hand cymbals \m/      sadly they are all orchastras.. I HATE orchastras. Oh well, the hand cymbals & bass drum parts are prolly my fav parts in the show."

"event","Heheh, yay... today in science the teacher called me to the front of the room to tell me that I wrote the most complete lab report on a test. Then, I got a 93 (relatively high)  grade on the science test and in English I got an A on a report. I remember last year, I was like, barely passing my classes.

Well, in another 30 min I have to leave for band. This sucks, band is the last place I wanna go to and even worse is that I am going to spend an hour with the just the person that contributes the most to why I do not want to go. I know Sid will prolly find some way to piss me off. Oh well, lifes a bitch and then you die. Atleast I get to play marching cymbals on the Closure \m/

My hearing is really taking a toll, between playing all of that shrill shit in pit, concerts, listening to music too loudly,  and using that freakin hit hat on my drumset. Now, every time that I drum the vibrations are so strong that my Smashing Pumpkins clock ALWAYS falls off the wall. It never fails, I have to remember to take it down whenever I practice now."

"event","today didn't suck as much as i feared it would... for concert band I played cymbals, altho i fucked up my part badly. Then uh... for math i almost fell asleep. For lunch i had rawkin funnel cake and stuff. then for science i took a bigass test and stuff. then for reading we did...uh...stuff. i met up with ashley swaine for the first time in over a year and took her bus home. unfortunatly, i ended up not being able to get any of my music for drum lessons which sucked but pat was cool about it.

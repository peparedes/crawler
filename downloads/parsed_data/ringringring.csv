"event","I&nbsp;think this is a god over-a-year-lapsed-between part 2 to my last LJ&nbsp;entry. 

Brandon &amp; I broke up &amp;, as always, I have to find the perfect song to describe how I feel. Just found it:


Maria Taylor - Lady Luck

 We were the words that washed from the sand - I still prayed we wouldn't give it up.
 We were the wings of a hummingbird, but I grew tired as I would wait for Lady Luck.
 
 We were the blue in the newborn's eye - I still prayed we could keep it up.
 We were the view from my childhood room, but I grew wise as I would look for Lady Luck.
 
 We were the wear in my favorite shirt, I still prayed we could make it work.
 We were the lair for the baby cubs, but I grew strong as I prepared for Lady Luck.
 
 And follow yourself &amp; hope that you know where your going,
&amp;don't question your steps that lead you into the morning.
 And you'll meet a friend along the way. You can't wait for each new day.
 It doesn't always work the way you planned it. I like it better this way.
 
It's lady luck."

"event","&nbsp;Some things are too good. Some things are pretty bad.

I smashed a full soda over my boyfriend's head &amp; whilst balling for an extended &amp; being told that I'll be loved no matter what, I decided to take my bipolar medication again. MISTAKE. Then I suffered from withdrawal for several days &amp; haven't slept a full night since, but things are looking up.

Speaking of my boyfriend, I&nbsp;totally don't believe in happily ever after, so why have things been so amazing? Can you quit reading my mind all the time &amp; making me love you so much? ps. I still can't trust you because of the past.


NO job. No money. Wish I was better at school.

This is immature, I guess."

went over to brandon's house around 11am &amp; napped for like an hour,
then we went to guitar center where he bought a bunch recording stuff.
i wanted to which wich really badly, but we went to gyros instead &amp; ate really crappy falafel.
i got my mustache waxed.
we went back to brandon's where he set up his equipment
while i addressed all his graduation thank you letters,
then when i was done i just sat there while fiddled with his stuff until 4pm,
then we left with his little brother to their hair appointments
&amp; i did sudoku while they got hair cuts.
then we went back to brandon's &amp; i kind of had high hopes for hanging outs,
but he just recorded a bunch of stuff &amp; made a lot of adjustments while i sat there.
i was really bored &amp; hungry, &amp; i didn't want to interrupt what he was doing,
so i just went home &amp; made myself dinner.
then my grama &amp; i watched 'the glass house' while i ate.
that was deff the best part of my day. it ended like 15 minutes ago.
now i have to go back to brandon's because i'm going to go watch him play a basketball game.

i really don't want to eat, though! i'm not nauseous or anything because i got a pill for that, but the thought of food entering my food, is not pleasing. i will sip hot tea all day &amp; be happy. ugh, i can't believe i was worried about this!"

Not worse than you thought
He'll always come back as the man you dropped
He'll never come back as the man you loved&lt;/i&gt;

i thought i'd at least like living in arlington, but i don't know anyone here. i don't have a job here. i need to hang out with annie more, but that situation is so strained. it just feels weird, because like six months ago, i lived in irving &amp; i drove to arlington like 1-3 times a week because every friend i had lived in arlington. being the only one under 21 in a group of people was pretty alienating, but i had a 23-year-old boyfriend anchoring me in, but without him, it's dumb to think anyone would want to hang out with a 20-year-old, who throws tantrums &amp; really has nothing to offer. even when i went to this gift-exchange over christmas, i got a present that was stuff for someone who has an apartment, then realized i'm a loser who lives in her uncle's spare bedroom, left early, was followed by my exboyfriend, who got into my car as i was trying to leave, then preceded the beg me together back together with him for like an hour, which just turned into a screaming match, then i just went to my sister's house &amp; cried while holding me dog all night. i'm not a valuable asset to any social gorup.&nbsp;

if not being 21 isn't hard enough, dating someone two years younger than me has made me a leper. idk, everything is so weird. yesterday he said to me, ""do you think i'm really mature for my age?"" &amp; i said no. then he asked why i would want to date him then. UGH BECUASEZ we're strangely the same person &amp; everything stupid &amp; immature about him is really easy to forgive because i've been the same way &amp; i've pretty much gotten over it. idk, the way he's such a people-pleaser &amp; let's people be mean to him all the time, which is, of course, the reason people are mean to him. i just try to be nice to him all the time &amp; he really needs that. it's nice to be needed. &amp; it feels dumb to put all my efforts towards someone who is leaving in six months, but if a year is all we get, i'll make the best of it. i'll try to fight less, even though we haven't gone on a date in two weeks! i feel like i was allowed to be upset about it?

after gerardo &amp; i broke up, my theory of everyone i ever cared about in my whole life has left me, seemed super confirmed, but my sister moved back into town to become somewhat of a confidant, my long-lost highschool boyfriend, first true love blah-blah, has turned years of on &amp; off silence &nbsp;into one of the best friendships i've ever had &amp; i guess ida visits on holidays.

"event","i'm a coffee addict! isn't that weird? well, it is if you knew i've always thought coffee was gross even though i had never really tried it until less than a month ago. i work at a brazilian coffee house! kind of, it's really just a brazilian-inspired restaurant with a big coffee bar. i don't even like those fancy flavored coffees, i like 16 ounces of plain, black coffee with two sweet n lows. guys, don't expect me to go through a starbucks drive thru with you to pick up $4 1000-calorie coffee drinks. 


my day if i was responsible:

 6:15: wake up &amp; take shower
6:45: make myself breakfast &amp; leave the house
7:45: get off train, pick up coffee &amp; be in class by 8am
12:00: leave class &amp; work on homework
1:45: arrive at work for 2pm shift
11:00: leave work &amp; go straight to bed when i get home


my actual day:

7:00: wake up, shove my stuff together &amp; make breakfast
7:15: leave house, then do homework on the train
8:15: get coffee, stroll into my 8am class at 8:30
11:30: leave class to read in the library
12:30: nap on library couch
1:30: wake up &amp; catch train
2:05: arrive at work for 2pm shift
11:00 leave work &amp; go home, hang out with gerardo
12:30 fall asleep"

"event","i've been to select my candidate for president based strictly on the issues. too hard. no one in the democratic or repbublican party's ideas are aligned with mine. hilary &amp; rudy are the two closest, but they totally suck! the socialist &amp; green party websites are pretty aligned with my thinking. i guess i think it's really strange that i'm kind of a closet tree-hugging, extreme-leftist, feminist socialist who is a member of peta. i'm not really crazy enough to be behind peta, actually. i kind of want to not be a member of that anymore. i don't know, i guess i don't like how everyone i know who is ""left wing"" (for the most part) is just way to the right of me &amp; i don't think i'm going to change anyone's mind &amp; i don't like arguing or flag-waving.


today was my third day or class &amp; tomorrow we have a test! 5 week summer school is so strange. i really don't like it. i'm a-sleepy"

"event","i can't even believe how much i miss my puppy! i had to wake up at 6:15am to get him to the spca to get his vaccinations &amp; get neutered by 7:30 &amp; i'm super sleepy &amp; i have no one to spoon with. no one to try to steal my waffles, either.

4:33pm: i just brought my puppy home! he doesn't even know me! i just put his little cone around his head &amp; set him in the middle of my bed with two box fans blowing on him."

"event","i'm totally back on lj on a consistent basis now that i have a new charger for my laptop! thanks for the two nudges, a-holes.

i got a new job waiting tables at cafe brazil. i've only been on the job five days, but i lovelovelove it so far. if i work here long enough i think i'll know conversational spanish.

i start summer school eight days. fashion sketching is super time consuming &amp; the cost of supplies is killer, but it's will be well worth it. plus, my pub. trans. journal is lonely. 

i'm going to sleep. matt &amp; kim's set was TOO SHORT!"

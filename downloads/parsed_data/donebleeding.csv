I don't fucking know why and right now I just don't fucking care. I'll wait until they unsuspend my account to type out about the past couple days. Right now, all I'll just say is that Kriats fucking rules and I love her. XD She really made all the crap I went through worth it. Yeah, let's just say I had the worst luck on this trip. I mean the WORST. I'll talk about it later though, maybe, hopefully.

When I had my personal site, I never wanted an LJ cause I thought it was really stupid to have that and another blog. I'm glad I got this though because I found so many awesome people with the same interests as me. 

I've been having a lot of fun the past few nights with <lj user=""x_plasticplan_x"">, <lj user=""bartendersgirl"">, and <lj user=""xturnedtoblack"">. You guys PWN, and I love ya.

Then there's <lj user=""outlier1985""> who is a neverending source of entertainment for me. He is probably the most hilarious person I have ever met. He's crazy, but I <3 him.

<lj user=""_shardsxofxme_""> also pwns. We rarely talk on AIM because we're too busy having conversations in LJ comments, lol. But her Jericho obsessing reminds me of me and for that I love her. She's awesome. XD

Everyone I didn't mention, I love y'all too. XD You all fucking rock and I'm glad to have ya as my friends. :)

Last night, I was bored, so I made this: <a href=""http://donebleeding.org/abstract.jpg"">http://donebleeding.org/abstract.jpg</a>.

Just the fact that they're doing this is pissing me off. It's weird how pretty much all the people cut so far were on SD. It's like they're deliberately killing that roster or something.

I swear if Nova gets cut, I will slit someone's throat. >:(

Yeah and let's hire Skull Von Krush, who fucking sucks and always has fucking sucked. Good move idiots.

I am so pissed off right now. I hope Dawn sues their asses considering she was fired during a maternity leave, and I think that's against the law or something.

I would really like to know what their fucking thinking right now. I mean firing the Dudleys?? WTF. They're like the only GOOD tag team they fucking have.

I'm finally getting some peace and quiet right now with my music blasting. It's so nice. I cherish these moments, cause I don't get many of them. I thought I wasn't going to get them at first, because Stef was here all day (figures when my sis and her husband go down the shore someone's gotta come over). She didn't leave til like 10, and as soon as she was walking out, my sis and her husband came in. So by then, I just wanted to pull my fucking hair out. Then Stef comes back in, because apparently her car was broken into. So, I had to go to the gas station with her so we could vacuum all the broken glass out of the car. That was fun. Then I came home and thankfully, my sis and dickface went to bed, so I'm here all alone and I loves it!

I'm talking to <a href=""http://christhebrain.com"" target=""_blank"">Chris</a>. I haven't talked to him in forever! He's usually only on during the day now and that's when I sleep so we rarely have a conversation that lasts more than 5 minutes anymore. It sucks, 'cause I miss him. So I'm glad to finally have talked to him for a couple hours. I know he reads this sometimes, so TELL YOUR FRIEND I SAID HE'S FUCKING SMOKING!!! kthx.

Now, I'm off to do stuff. Actually, no, I'm not going to do anything. But I am talking to <lj user=""outlier1985""> so I'm sure he will keep me entertained for awhile since he's hilarious. Toodles."

"event","I have a question. I've been seeing this a lot lately. It's about the Godforsaken Diva Search. 

What is everyone's obsession with the Ashley chick? I mean you can't honestly want her to win yet since you haven't seen her do anything. She could turn out to be the most annoying chick in the damn thing. Is it because she wears fishnets? WTF.

Personally, I can't believe they're doing this again. I can't believe I'm gonna have to go to RAW and witness this shit live. Knowing how brutal Philly fans are, I hope they tear everyone a new asshole. 

How about we just skip the whole thing altogether considering most of those chicks will be hired anyway? Waste of time."

"event","Figured I'd post 'cause I'm bored as fuck. If I wasn't talking to Krista (<3) right now, I'd probably go insane.

Since I haven't been in school, I don't do much of anything. I used to walk all the time while in school, so I haven't done it. Tonight though I decided to get off my ass and go for a walk, and ended up walking about 2 miles or so. It was nice. Fucking hot as hell, but nice. Popped in my Frameshift CD, which now has got me hooked BACK onto it. I'm gonna try to do this every day.

Krista sent me some HOT pics of Nova/Simon Dean (although I refuse to call him that, so that shall be the last time I will). I miss him. He's my buddy even if he did call me a weirdo and said I had no life for being at an ECW show on a Saturday night. Assface. He's lucky he's awesome, hot and his favorite band is Skid Row, or I'd beat his ass if I ever saw him again, haha. I remember always dragging him into chatrooms back in the day. Man, those were the days.

Hrm. I should start making icons again. I tried the other night but they all turned out like shit so I gave up. I fail at icon making and life. Sorry."

Anyways, all we did was watch the ECW PPV 'cause they all wanted to watch it since they haven't seen it. Then after that was over we watched an ECW tape. We watched the Born to be Wired match between Sabu and Funk. God, that match always gets me squeamish. It was the first time for Linsey seeing it and she was sitting there the whole time with her hand over her mouth saying ""Oh my God."" It was hilarious.

I want to e-mail RVD but his address isn't on his site anymore. I think I remember it from back in the day, so hopefully it's still his address. I just want to tell him that he is a God and I love him (and ask him if I could grab that scrumptious ass of his).

I want to make a shirt for RAW, but I don't know what I want it to say. Of course, it would have to do with Jericho (if he doesn't get traded...like that'll happen). Any ideas?"

I saw Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street tonight with my mom. It was good. A little long, but good. Some of it made no sense to me though. Plus, it's a musical so it was really hard to follow along with the lyrics. Thankfully, I know the story already so I got the gist of it. I'm still curious as to whether he was a real guy or just a myth. My books and crimelibrary.com give the background of it but they still say they don't know if he actually existed. How can you not know if a serial killer existed? Seriously. Especially one like that...but whatever.

Last night I was in an MSN chat with <lj user=""outlier1985""> and <lj user=""phantomlord_lop"">...fun times. Hopefully we can do that again sometime 'cause it was funny. XD 

I've been trying to work on some icons and it isn't working out too well so I think I shall save all the requests I got for tomorrow. I would like to work on some band icons rather than wrestling, but wrestling's all I got so I shall have to do those.

I must thank <lj user=""phantomlord_lop""> for plugging the <a href=""http://donebleeding.org/hardcorecafe"" target=""_blank"">Cafe</a> in his column. It already got a few more cool members 'cause of him, so thanks! Hopefully we get a few more 'cause of it. XD

I want a new screen name. In fact, I want RVD Girl. I know I could use it but I need to get rid of AOL, and with losing AOL I shall lose that name, and I don't want to. :( I also want a new journal name...but that would be a pain in the ass, and I'm not sure I'd want to go through with it. I'd need a name to begin with anyway, which I don't have one in mind at the moment.

So this week, I'm going to be seeing Sweeney Todd with my mom. She told me she saw that and I was like =O!! I told her I wanted to see that so bad and she was surprised I even heard about it. I'm like ""Mom...I read about serial killers all the time...come on!"" So Wednesday, I'm going to be seeing that, which means I'll have Wednesday, Thursday and Friday off. YAY! XD

But that also means I'll be working late on Tuesday to make up the hours I'll be missing. Not looking forward to it, because I hate working with Joanie since she's such a bitch, but it's only for one night, so I think I'll last. Hopefully I can go the night without punching her. We shall see."

Of course, my sis didn't leave me her credit card to buy the tickets like she said she would. So I fell back asleep around 10:30, then she came home at 11:30. I just spent a half hour on Ticketmaster trying to get tickets, which I finally did. Ticketmaster is so aggravating. But yeah I did get tickets, so I am going. XD

I feel really bad though. I didn't get Jamie or Linsey a ticket. I know I shouldn't feel bad because I DID try to get in touch with them for the past few days, but they never got back to me. Plus, they knew about this for a month and I told them that if they want tickets, I need the money BEFORE the 18th and that I WILL be ordering them on the 18th. I know I'm probably gonna get a lot of shit. I really don't care, 'cause I'm tired of waiting for them to decide what they want to do and them waiting til the last minute to tell me they want to do something. I'm sorry, but this is wrestling and I always want good seats, so I always order the day the tickets go on sale. I don't know if I'll be going to the Wildwood show now, which I REALLY want to do. Maybe I can convince Stef to go. 

But yeah, I guess I'm excited. Still worrying about Jericho or Christian getting drafted. That would suck majorly for me. I think we're going to go at 11 in the morning again to see if we can meet anyone coming in. Plus, I would love to see Stef chase after Edge's car again. That was hilarious.

I'm watching the ECW PPV for the 4th fucking time! Joey just came out and everytime I see him cry, I start crying. This time it was no different. So yes...I have tears in my eyes right now, thank you very much. Joey owns every commentator and you know it.

Goddamn, I really fucking miss ECW. :'( Those were the best shows I've ever been to ever, and nothing has ever topped them since. 

I know WWE would somehow fuck it up really bad, but a part of me would love for them to bring it back.

But I must apologize, 'cause WWE did not fuck up this PPV like I thought they would. They did a great job at showing what ECW really was so props to them.

"event","Well, the PPV has just ended. Lots of tears for me tonight. I mean LOTS. I fucking cried at so much shit.

First tears: As soon as Joey came out and he was crying, which caused me to cry. It was so great seeing him again. He did a wonderful job with the PPV. So did Foley, which I was surprised. I thoroughly enjoyed their play by play.
Second: During Lance's match because I realized it would be the last time I'd see him and I love him so much. I totally marked out for the Impact Player pose though!
Third: RVD's promo. I could tell he was getting really choked up and I started bawling. Although after the promo was over, even though everything he said was the truth, I was like ""He is so fired.""
Fourth: Heyman's speech got me good. Plus, he was crying too. I hate when guys cry, 'cause then I start crying, lol. Heyman is officially my God though. He freakin' owned.

I'm sure there were other times but I can't think of them right now.

At first I thought the PPV sucked. The matches were way short compared to ECW standards. I know why they were. But couldn't they cut about 20 minutes from JBL's pointless speech to give to the matches? Not only that, but they friggin' CUT during Doring's promo to go back to the SD! guys, which angered me GREATLY, 'cause I'm a huge Doring mark. I was looking forward to seeing him. >_<

But, I tried to block the invasion out of my mind. Tried to ignore it as much as possible, and found myself REALLY enjoying the show. 

The Lance/Jericho match was good for the short amount of time it was given. I actually marked out when Credible and Jason came out (never thought I'd say that, but I did!). I also loved when Joey said, ""Calgary - dramatic pause - Alberta, Canada."" HAHA! <333 Joey.

Guido/Super Crazy/ Tajiri I loved! The Moonsault off the balcony was craziness! TOTALLY FUCKING MARKED OUT for Mikey's Whippersnapper off the top rope. It looked sick. I LOVE MIKEY!!!!!! It was a really cool match. Glad they added this.

Rey vs. Psicosis was cool, again for the amount of time it was given, which was like...5 minutes. I loved when the crowd booed the 619 though. =x

RVD's promo was amazing. That's the RVD I know and was obsessed with back in the day. I really did cry during this promo. Not just because everything he said was the absolute truth, but because of the fact that not only was he on the verge of tears, but when he said that he would have given everything up just to have wrestled there tonight just makes me tear up thinking about it. I love that man. I truly, truly do.

Sabu vs. Rhino was good for reminiscing's sake. Vintage Sabu there.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Benoit was good, but who didn't think it would be? The ""Edge Fucked Lita"" and ""He's Got Herpes"" chants during it fucking owned as well.

Masato vs. Awesome was fucking AWESOME! I heard both were in bad shape so the match was expected to suck, but I completely got into it. Even the crowd chanted ""This match rules!"" How many Awesome Bombs did Masato take?? JESUS. I fucking loved it.

Heyman's promo = simply amazing. Again I cried because he was crying although the line, ""I'm not crying. The reason my eyes are red is because I was smoking a joint in the back with Van Dam,"" was greatness. His shooting on the WWE wrestlers was fantastic. I especially loved the HHH line. That had me rolling and proved to me that Heyman is, indeed, God.

Dreamer/Sandman vs. The Dudleys was great to see again too. FRANCINE!!!!!!!!!! I marked out when I saw her!!!!!! XD Beulah too! bWo...just everything basically. Although I missed the ending because the webcast froze. >_< I missed the fucking flaming table. GODDAMNIT.

The invasion part was alright. Bischoff getting his ass beat was cool. All in all a GREAT PPV just for the memories it brought back for me. After hearing Styles and his awesome commentary, it's going to be hard to watch RAW and SD. Easily the best PPV in a long fucking time.

Although, another thing that irked me was the themes. :( The music was a big part of ECW and the only wrestlers that used their original themes were Sandman (obviously), Sabu and Taz. I wanted to hear Lance's theme one last time.

Anyways, I'm still in mark out mode so if you'll excuse me, I shall be heading off to watch some ECW tapes.

The lack of plugs for matches is no coincidence, and it doesn't really matter who wins or loses tonight. WWE didn't want matches for the PPV announced as many of the guys involved in matches tonight were teaming together for the invasion angles on RAW and SmackDown! this past week.

If I could find a pic of Dreamer and Dawn together, I'd so make an icon of that.

As much as I hate the invasion aspect of this whole thing, I really am looking forward to the PPV. I read the results to Shane Douglas' show and that's a DVD I'm definitely going to pick up. I really regret not going to it now. It sounded awesome.

So tickets for RAW go on sale Saturday. Jamie wants to camp out for tickets, but I don't know if she can get off work Saturday. It doesn't matter to me either way, although it would be nice to get front row. I'm up all night anyway so staying up all night shouldn't be a problem for me. Still gotta get tickets for Wildwood too. God, why must I be so poor? :/

Yet again, I have nothing to say. Life is just boring lately. :|"

"event","A huge thanks to my sister for giving me her stomach virus. It's greatly appreciated. There's nothing like throwing up everything you've eaten in the past 2 weeks.  Not to mention there's shit I wanted to do today, but now I can barely move. :/

I wanted to go to Hardcore Homecoming tonight. I don't have tickets, but me and Jamie were gonna go to see if we could find Frank there and maybe persuade him to get us in. That's if he would actually remember me. :/ Damn me for not going to shows anymore.

But now, I am not going anywhere. I hate being sick. And I have to go out and get my bitch of a pig lettuce, before she bites my other boob. Yes, she bit my boob the other day and it still hurts. She's so cute, yet incredibly evil.

Well, I'm off. I have like no energy. It sucks. :("

"event","Ok so me and Krista are going over the ECW mag the WWE put out to see who they left out. So far we have discovered that they left out: Justin Credible, Lance Storm (WTF?), Nova, Danny Doring, The Triple Threat (again WTF?), Steve Corino, Jerry Lynn (besides one pic), and last but not least, which completely boggles my feeble mind...

<b>RHYNO.</b>

Not only are there no pics of him, but I don't even think they MENTIONED him. Last World Heavyweight and Television Champion gets absolutely no mention whatsoever in the mag. Explain it to me please. It's a good mag. I'm not saying it's not, but that's really just ricockulous (if I may steal a word from Jericho)."

JERICHO JUST SIGNED ON. /spazz

And he just signed off. As I said to Krista, even a God can't escape the wrath of AOL. He must be getting booted again.

I could make this into a rant about work, but I don't feel like it. In fact, I don't feel like doing much of anything. I have to make more icons though. I'm planning on making like 347357365346 ECW icons, of like the whole locker room but that requires scanning my ECW mags. Scanning = pain in the balls. Still gotta finish this Justin Credible icon for Kriats that I started...last night. O_o It will get done eventually. I read the SD spoilers, so now I HAVE to watch it 'cause it's going to own. Still pissed about this whole WWE invasion thing though. >_<

Ya know..last week Henning said he was going to put my wallpapers on the site and he hasn't yet. I'm a really impatient person so I'm dying to see my work on an actual site. PUT THEM UP HENNING! #$^#$%@#%#$!

I've had to pee for like the past 2 hours, but has my ass gone upstairs to go yet? No it hasn't. Laziness takes precedence over my bladder. What can I say?

And that, my friends, is another random, pointless post from yours truly. Thank you and good day. I SAID GOOD DAY.

P.S. - This song owns me. Doring rules all."

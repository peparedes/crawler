"event","So today, I decide to log into Livejournal after receiving an email about some wacky innovation called bookmarklet.  It lets you write entries on Livejournal without ever leaving the page you are on; WOW, there's no way I'm missing out out that?!  What a stupid idea, don't people come up with the stupidest ideas?  Like the guy, what's his name, Alan Greenspan - the moron who thought it was a good idea to increase the level of credit available to Mr Average Joe who couldn't even afford to pay back their debts?! Yeh, thanks a lot for that and now I have had to endure the first 12 weeks in my 3rd year of Uni hearing the words, credit crunch, recession and deadlines every fucking day! Sometimes I think the level of scope on this course is so narrow that when this recession finally abates, my knowledge of this sordid fiasco will be rendered utterly useless. So what else have I learnt?! Nothing! Nothing except for the fact that lying in assignments does give you better marks!

Anyway, I think it's apt that this entry should be dedicated to a time of reflection of what a year 2008 has been.  Actually, I don't want to reflect. It has just been a transition year as bad as it sounds. A transition from the year 2007 to the year 2009.  I think it has pretty much been a very meaningless year for me where I just tried to kid myself into believing my own stupid fantasies. I need to get really serious, I need to get my act together and let me be me.  In other words, I need to grow up! I'm not a kid anymore, I can't just play with people's emotions with at a click of the finger.  So yeh, it has a year where I learnt a hell of a lot about relationships and gave me a valuable insight into how a womans' mind operates.  Even so, I just can't remember much this year, I really can't, it has just passed me by just like that.  No offence to my current ex, even though we had happy memories, we just weren't compatible, even you told me that on numerous occasions.  It took me a while to realise that reality but when you say it so many times, it just sticks in your head. I just hope you know that.

Right now just sucks, I'm at home and I don't feel particularly festive, I don't really like it here.  I have Masters' applications to fill in and I'm already under pressure to send them off before the 30th December because I promised myself I would get all this crap out of the way before the start of a new year.  I don't think it will be a particularly exciting year next year. It'll be the same old what with me having to complete my final year of University, I'll be under a great deal of pressure to acquire the grades that I deserve.  The fucking recession will be ensuring that I don't enjoy myself next year, and having to start a Masters degree doesn't sound even remotely enticing right now!  Hey, why am I in such a negative mood!?  I never used to be like this, maybe it's a sign of me realising just how life just got serious and I really need to take it chin on!

I do, however, miss this girl.  I feel like I've dropped her in the deep end of a swimming pool with no life preservers to help her.  I have just exited on relationship and then entered her life without taking any time out for a breather.  I thought I had learnt from my mistakes last time round, but this time I thought I could handle it.  Yes, I can handle it but I do feel paranoid about her friends judging me and being perceived as some sort of 'playboy' which I am quite clearly not! My outward appearance can definitely testify to that!  I just want to say that I care for you deeply, and I do miss you!  Even though I feel jealous about you hanging out with other guys, it's just a natural symptom a boy feels when he sees you enjoying yourself without him!  It's okay, I'll let you do your own thing because I don't wanna be a burden on you, however, I do want to show you I care and I guess in some stupid way, being jealous is that way!  It's not up to me what you do with your life anyway! You've lived it for 22 years, I've only been in it for less than 2 months!  I'm just a guy who wants your attention, and I want you to show how much you care for me!  I think I'm like a teenage girl, because I really value the texts you send me.  Everytime my phone goes off, I keep hoping it's from you, and not that stupid guy Pak who keeps telling me to do fucking work over the festive period! I mean, WTF!

Anyway, I must bid you adieu, if anyone even reads this blog at all?!  I know a special someone is reading it right now though ;)"

"event","You know, I never got to say goodbye to her. I've acted cold and callous towards her in ways that I'd never known. How did it get to this situation? How did we go from being wildly in love to me pushing her away? I guess I was too vulnerable, too weak to make my own decisions; decisions that I have to live with for the rest of my life. I'll never forgive myself for acting that way towards you, for making you feel like nothing. 

And now she has become cold towards me, something that I have never known her to be. But I backed her into a corner and turned her against me...

But the truth is, you are my everything... My everything, that ultimately, I cannot have...

I cried knowing that I will never see her again, I'll never see her bright smile everytime she saw me. She always had the best advice, always there for me to talk to and above all, she never stopped loving me. I know she has now... 

Over the past few days I've realised one thing, love cannot be substituted for anything else, not lust or temptation. I've realised that I still love her more than she can imagine; it's only when you lose something that you realise how much you once had.  

I don't know how to get over her, how to justify my decision to let her go. My reasons were clear, the wait was too much, I'd only get to see her once a year at best.  I was crying every night yearning for her presence, I was being hurt by my own love for her.

But I know now, that I'd very much rather have her love than some infatuation of some girl on my course. Of course, I'd been contemplating it a long time, even before the Summer I used to think how dire our situation was, but I'd always try to act strong. But these thoughts became more frequent and it was playing on my mind every time I talked to you.

You know, even when I split up with you, I never stopped loving you. Even when I went to London, all I could think of was you. And today, I saw our pictures again, inadvertedly, and broke down crying. 

Our break up was not motivated by another girl, it was motivated by the fact I loved you too much to endure this wait, that I needed to break from you so that I wouldn't get hurt.  I never had a ready-made replacement like you believed. I never did.  

And now I'm hurt even more... I'm no longer able live this life.

She was right, I'm not strong enough to know what I really want, I give in too easily.

It was only 3 months ago that I said these words, ""The future is looking bright, and the one thing I am certain of, is that you are the girl that I want to be with and love for as long as I exist!""

This girl was all I ever needed in my life."

Ever since her life-changing news, I have been thinking non-stop about this whole Summer trip and how everything seems that much more final and our plans will become more concrete.

Secured tickets to Give It A Name 2007 @ Birmingham on the 29th April with these acts performing:
The All American Rejects
New Found Glory
Motion City Soundtrack
Enter Shikari
Senses Fail
Madina Lake
Saosin
Mae
Kevin Devine
Kids in Glass Houses

It is a very solid line-up and I am eagerly anticipating this gig especially Saosin, a certain girl got me into them and I'm totally hooked! I'm also looking forward to The All American Rejects, Motion City Soundtrack and Senses Fail. It should be a great day.

Yvonne is so beautiful, I feel so lucky to have a place in her heart. I haven't felt so loved in a long time and I am going to cherish this feeling for as long as possible. I hate it when I don't get to chat to you during the late hours of the days - I miss you so much. When we finally meet, I will truly be the happiest guy on Earth."

"event","...but in this case, I will happily say goodbye to a wretched year 2006. I shall summarise, in bullet points, all the major events that happened this year, in chronological order.
- Loads of exams in January, mostly resits
- Met Charlotte who would become one of my best friends, but not anymore
- Bottled my final exams and consequently had to go to a rubbish University
- Enrolled at DMU, and have made some good friends - Uni is horrible though
- Got totally bladdered for the first time and a few more followed
- Met Yvonne on myspace and I'm so happy!
- Secured our first choice house with my flatmates

As you can see, not much has happened this year but I think you can blame that on college exams, University and of course... being a lazy bum!

Anyway, I shall drink to 2007 as I can envisage it being a much better year for me and first of many more to come!"

"event","I logged off my computer three hours ago and yet for some bizarre reason, I couldn't sleep and then I realised I hadn't wrapped the damn presents up! This happened at 12:30am when I should have been sound asleep. I wrapped my presents, then I forgot whose belonged to who so I had to reopen them again, and then wrap it up again remembering to put labels on. I carried this out with parcel paper and sticky white labels because all the christmas wrapping paper and selotape was in my parents room! Nevertheless, I think I did a great job!

Now it's time for me to sleep, and I think I have a cold coming along..."

"event","It's Christmas tomorrow, and I am looking forward to a nice family get together and actually sitting at the same table for once! I'm also looking forward to getting out my Xbox, playing Pro Evo and Tony Hawks with my brother - I have the upper hand over in him in most games; Mark - 1223, Thomas - 0. That's not technically true, but reflective of our gaming ability!

Anyway, today was a good day, it's Christmas eve and I didn't feel like doing much else. I should have wrapped my presents, but they are still on my desk feeling sorry for themselves. I feel guilty because I always leave everything to the last minute. Prioritising is definitely NOT my strong point, nor is time management!

I noticed that tonight we have neglected the traditional brandy and mince pie on the mantelpiece routine; I know it doesn't seem like a big deal but a part of me realises that traditions move on and we are not kids anymore. Still, it was nice to cling on dream that Santa existed, I knew otherwise 7 years ago but Tom and Zoe still had that luxury. We're not children anymore, but I still hold on to the values of Christmas; It holds fond memories for me.

I remember when I was a kid, I was enthralled by Christmas, the best feeling was knowing that Santa was coming down our chimney, leaving us a galore of presents. When it was time to sleep, I was always giddy with excitement, running around the house, giggling with my siblings, it was always a chore to sleep, but Mummy told us if we didn't sleep Santa wouldn't leave us any presents. I always willed myself to sleep and I used to wonder why she stayed up spring cleaning whilst everyone was residing in the land of nod. I know now, which is why I appreciate my parents for allowing me to experience the wonders of being a child at Christmas time. My brother and sister were always the first ones up and I told them to wake me up as early as possible because we just wanted to rip those presents open! Once I remember my sister woke up at 3am and opened Santa's presents, she couldn't sleep so she stayed up the rest of the night just looking at the presents, playing with her new toys and walking around the house willing everyone to wake up; she started crying because it was so early in the morning but she couldn't sleep due to the excitement. I'll never forget that for as long as I live. Even though I may not show it most of the time, no matter what, I will always love Tom and Zoe and this memory only makes me realise just how important they are to me.

Christmas is a time we put aside our differences and embrace each other with open arms."

"event","I've been back home since Monday and I am very happy about my current state of affairs, I just hope this holiday doesn't end too soon because I don't think I could ever embrace the ever-increasing workload I have amassed at University.

I went shopping today and made some weird impulse buys, I bought my Dad the DVD boxset of CSI - the 4th season - however, it wasn't the latest one so I went back to the store and asked for a refund. They were very pedantic about this despite the reciept saying I could replace or refund goods if they were not what you wanted. I clearly stated this and in the end they finally agreed to part with their money, to which I spent it in WHSmith, where they had season 5 and I was a very happy camper especially since it was a buy one get one free offer! My brother and sister have the Family Guy and American Dad DVD boxset to share as they both enjoy Family Guy but I doubt they have ever heard of American Dad. When it came to Mum and Nanny's presents, I didn't know what to buy them so I bought some nice pens and a diary for Mum. I might go to the shops again on Sunday because I think my Nan deserves something a bit more substantial; Mum can share CSI with Dad!

On the other hand, I have already recieved the bulk of my Christmas gifts, I got an Xbox 360, from my parents, for my birthday and Christmas combined; I can't complain as it did leave a hole in my Dad's wallet. I can expect a Tony Hawks game from Nan, I have wanted to buy it for ages so I can't wait to rip it open and muck around with it on Christmas morning! Yvonne has bought me some Stewie boxers and this is the present I am most looking forward to and I think it is pretty easy to understand why. Other than that, I can expect to receive a load of crap and junk from the family friends so I'm not getting my hopes up for anything better than these gifts I have already mentioned!

Anyway, I want to talk about Christmas and it's meaning, it has certainly changed a lot since I was a kid. I used to think that Christmas was a time to receive presents of substantial worth, snow days and of course, Roast Dinner. Nowadays, it's not as simple as that, Christmas is a time of giving no matter how much the present is worth, it is the thought that counts. I know this now and I shall be very happy with what I get this year. It's the time of year where we can really bond as a family and get away from the reality of life, the financial pressure and social restraints. No, the 25th of December is the day when all is good and nothing else matters except  being jolly and enjoying the euphoria of the day Jesus was born."

I have a 750 report to write, with 5 appendixes using 10 named references, plus I also have to deal with the lonliness of living in a deserted flat and to compound my insecurities, Yvonne has disappeared for the weekend! They say positive karma comes to those who do good, well it may not look that way but this could just be a blessing in disguise. It will allow me to finish this goddamn work without getting distracted, and thus I am free to enjoy my next three weeks of gorging on some decent food, meeting mates and doing fuck-all really!

I got three Christmas presents from my mates earlier today, I wasn't really expecting anything so it was a pleasant surprise. I can also expect one from Yvonne, she is sending me some Stewie boxers from Singapore; I can't wait to get my hands on them lah. From my Nan, I am hoping she buys me an Xbox 360 game - namely Tony Hawks 8 - to freshen up my games collection and I have asked my parents for some much needed clothes. The only avenue I haven't covered is shoes, I desperately need a new pair because my current ones don't suit my style.

Here is a little poem I created just now off the top of my head

Yvonne is the best, the
Very very best
Oh how I miss her, and her
Nice cute face
Now I see her in my mind
Eee, I better sleep


If you look closely, it says Yvonne, down the left... How coincidential..."

Everytime she leaves me, I miss her like crazy, when I see her, my heart skips a beat. We haven't met yet, but why should it be any different?

"event","Today feels as though a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders, the past week had been absolute hell for me, but I finally pulled through. I guess I can attribute this turnaround to three factors; Yvonne, Alyaa and Christmas holidays. 

Yvonne has been a comforting distraction from the real world, she is just right for me. I hope our friendship sustains itself for the next six and a half months because I know I am going to need someone there for me. I guess we kinda promised ourselves that we would be save ourselves for each other, when I go to Singapore, and hope that we get on as well as we do on the interweb. I remain somewhat optimistic, but I can't help but think of the obstacles that may come between us two. It will be a long, hard journey, but I can't just let her go like that. 

Alyaa, she is probably one of my better friends on my course, I am grateful for her because I would be quite lonely otherwise. I enjoy our little chats in our lectures, my friendly jibbing of her height - she is only 5ft - and I appreciate the help she gives me. I may have lost faith in her a few days ago but we had been under a lot of stress then, she's a good friend to me and gives me a lot of useful insight as to what living in Asia; she is Bruneise. 

And finally, I really cannot wait for my Christmas holidays, I will be essay-free for a whole three weeks whilst also being able to sleep-in whenever the hell I want. I can't wait to see all my mates that I have seemingly lost contact with over the past twelve weeks; I intend to make up for that lost time by hanging out with them like 'old times'. It's a sad fact of life, but people move on; I'm just trying to prolong the process. 

Speaking of moving on, my dream of moving to Singapore seems but a lifetime away, I realise the stress and pain I will have to put myself through, but I think it is for my long-term good that I will see the benefits. Half my family live here - though not my immediate family - and I feel more at home in Singapore than I ever would in England; I consider myself an outsider. As I touched on before, the rising cost of living in England for very little gain is one of the major deciding factors. Another factor is I need to be around Chinese people, I walk around the streets of Devon and I am usually the only coloured person on the street because everyone else is whit; I feel as though I don't belong and I sometimes find myself getting anxious knowing the current state of discrimination in Britain. However, London and Leicester are very much cosmopolitan, but I don't like the areas very much; my hometown Bracknell, to a lesser extent, is somewhat multi-ethical but it is one of the most depressing places to live. In Singapore, I felt so at home, I didn't feel segregated from everyone else and it was nice to have people not staring at me for once in my life.

I'm such a blog whore now."

I am looking forward to it more than ever especially since my mum has almost bought my ticket and is bringing my senses closer to the reality of next Summer. I spend many nights searching google for everything I can find out about this tiny island, on the tip of Malaysia. One could say I am becoming increasingly consumed in this vacation, but I cannot help it, I have been wanting to go again ever since I touched down in England 3 and a half years ago and realised that Singapore was so much better. 

On the 19th, I shall have to avoid advances from Sarah, she sent me a text about an hour and a half ago saying that I made her day when she realised I was seeing her then. Charlotte then confirmed to me that this was indeed true and that they had been talking about me. I hope that she ignores me on Tuesday because I don't want to have to cause another broken heart, I'm not boosting my ego, but it seems that she has reignited her obsession with me. God help me.

Sure, I got hit on by a some gals, and sandwiched between two girls at one point, but I walked out of the place feeling lonely and down in the dumps. I had time to think on the way back to my flat, away from my friends, and I realised that this depression stemmed towards a desire for a relationship. The only problem, there are hardly any oriental girls around here. English girls, as fit as they may be, really do not appeal to me, I must be weird but I feel nothing for them, yet when I see an oriental girl, my heart skips a beat.

"event","Talking to my cousin, Serene, and my friend Yvonne yesterday afternoon gave me a great sense of anticipation of what to expect next Summer; it has been a long time since I have truly looked forward to anything. Maybe I know that I will be around people that of the same race [despite being half english] but I feel more connected to my asian side, or maybe I'm just happy to get out of England for once and escape the commitments and restraints if living here. I know I am excited about meeting my cousins for the first time in three years, and meeting Yvonne of course, it feels as though I have known her for ages despite having only met online for a month a bit. Most people frown upon meeting people on the Internet, but to be fair these people are just like you and me, we just happen to be living in the wrong parts of the world.

Anyway, this trip also has an underlying purpose, in the way that I will be trying to explore as much of Singapore as humanely possible - I want to live here in the future; an idea that has been at the back of my head for the last few years. And until recently, that idea has exploded out of control and I feel as though I have to live there. Though that will very much depend on how my vacation goes and whether it is financially and socially feasible. Could I cope with moving halfway across the world, leaving behind all my friends, and having to make a new set of friends. Could I cope with the overall cost of living although, granted, they don't pay as much taxes as we do. Could I cope with the climate and the world renowned humidity? What about living in a flat when I have lived in a house all my life? Is it worth leaving behind a financial security and the places of which I have grown fond of? I think I would miss Devon way too much, my family and friends as well.

However I know I wouldn't miss the insane taxes, the import and accomodation of 'black youth culture', London born-and-bred terrorists, the Christian Right, all factions of religious fanaticism, smug students, the rising cost of attending University, slags, politicians who aren't Sir Menzies Campbell, London, Liverpool, Scotland, Gaelic partisanship, self-proclaimed 'artists', BBC 1, BBC 2, girls who've undergone breast-augmentation surgery, being considered below America and Japan as the forerunner of new technology, the skate park over my road, Andy Mawson, Welsh nationalism, the whole of Bracknell and all its inhabitants barring my friends and family, Creationists, all evangelical denominations, two pence coins, Jonathon Ross, The Beatles, all female 'musicians' and 'artists', Natwest, Nationwide, Currys, not knowing where I belong, the Royal Family, the Daily Mail, all tabloids, my neighbour in Devon, idiots and no-marks, narcissist emos, self-segregating ethnic minorities, OAPs who fail to retake their driving test, slow drivers, the ridiculous cost of a Xbox 360 game, Russell Brand, global warming scare-mongering, plastic football fans, Mr Heathcote, people who don't love cats, PETA, txt spk culture, two of my ex-girlfriends, 97% of Britain's children, chavs, pikeys, queers, puffs, camp folk, lezzers, fucking wasps, pigeons, people in bands who reckon they are the shit, port blocking, being denied pornography, people who pimp their novas and astras, parents who feed their kids shit, teenage mums except this girl I know who is all right, interior designers, neologisms, self-proclaimed pirates, cystic fibrosis, the unjust financial and educational disparity between, say, someone who actually grafts and a cash-chucking trust-fund baby, the price of a bus fare, the notion that independence is solidified once you learn to drive or move into a 1-bedroomed bedroom-flat, amputees, farcical discrimination of anyone who isn't white, middle eastern wannabe-gangsters and the England Glory associated with football.

I reckon moving to Singapore would get me away from at least 90% of these."

"event","Sitting here having not accomplished anything today except for chatting to random e-people and sleeping most of the day, I feel a sense of anxiousness - unlike any I have felt before. I have deadlines looming large, exams in the first week back after the Christmas holidays and my body cannot take the unsuitable diet that I have been accustomed to for the past 10 weeks; my body clock is fucked, I have frequent tummy aches, and my eyes hurt like a bitch. I love University life, I really do, but the food is killing me and I do not have the gusto to rustle up anything anything on the hob. Lectures are now becoming a bore and I wonder whether this is the right course for me considering I find the core topic a right cunt to do. However, if I do the hard work now, I will reap in the benefits later in life, that is the thought that keeps me going and obviating me from defecting to some mickey mouse subject like photography or film studies.

I know this feeling will tide over in due course, I just don't know when or how it will happen. Someone help."

"event","The current state of affairs in AO Bede Hall is somewhat blurry in the sense I have little to no idea where everyone's loyalties lie. But as I see it we have three divisions in this flat; the Londoners, the 'weird ones' and the Soar Point Crew. Gone is the ideal where A0 was a thriving utopia of friendship and social follies, that is far from the case; the atmosphere in here is akin to an overwrought rope on it's last threads of fresher consanguinity. Should this link be severed, then I for one, will not be too disappointed and I am sure you will agree with me when you read what I have to say.

Ornella and Lesley tend to keep to themselves, I get on with them quite well whenever I see them around in the kitchen, but they are not the type I would be able to hang around with for an extended period of time. Both of them are synonymous with the Afican-London sub-culture bringing with them their Adidas trackie bottoms, Nike Air trainers and the all-to-common gansta drowl of which I would tend to be disassociated with. Safe Bruv

And now we have the weird guys, Robert and Andy; up until a month ago Robert was pretty much a regular guy I could enjoy a conversation with him. But nowadays, he has transformed into 'Camp Rob Extraordinaire'. I have no idea how he has changed but he turned from a genuinely interesting guy into a cesspit of innane ramblings; the downfalls of trying too hard to win people over. Saddening. And as for Andy, I have always had a dislike for him ever since I first moved in and laid eyes on this hulk of a malformed wretch. I don't know whether it was his shocking sense of humour, whether it was the way he walked so spastically, or whether I felt the inclination to have such a underlying comtempt for this guy. Well, whatever the case is I know that my first impressions were right and he acts like such a baby at the best of times, at the worst of times he is a snivelling cacophony of verbal atrocities. I just wish that he would fuck off and die, or at least disappear when I am around; I simply cannot stand that junk. Some of you may remember Catie, the 300lb mammoth. I would have classed Catie in the category of 'weird ones' had she not moved out leaving behind a trail of hatred and bitchiness; and what what reason? She wanted a better signal on her TV. However, we all knew better when she said 'it's not you, it's me', yes she moved out because of us. And what did we do, we tried to make her feel at home despite being a lumbering sack of jelly and a whiny cunt of a crybaby.

Anyway, all is not lost, I can however, hang out with Danny, Matt and Carter quite happily, they are pretty much the only sane guys left and actually have the same interests as me such as football - both in reality and virtual reality and going to clubs to enjoy a sociable drink. I wouldn't say our music tastes are quite aligned yet because I have been told on numerous occasions that my taste is quite frankly, shit; The focus of this jibbing generally being Tatu. I mean, even last night Matt bought this up momentarily and everyone seemed to have a good old laugh at this hilarious joke. But I don't see the problem, they have a great voice, are lesbians and their sound is quite unique! I guess some people cannot be converted! Anyway, the talk is early but I just may be moving into a house with these guys next year, and for that I am really happy and quite relieved. Much love.

If truth be told, I would say that I get on with everybody here, my body language is perfectly normal when speaking to the cretins in subject. However, inside I just want to get it all out and tell certain individuals what I think of them, if I, and indeed every person in this world, did this then no one would have a single friend. So I think it is just better to grin and bear it, whilst enjoying the occasional bitch behind their backs. Yes I know, I'm a cunt like that."

"event","My poem:

There are those who love 
and those who hate
those who are early and 
those who are late 
there are some who act,
they act like thugs
some are addicted 
to sex and drugs
some people dont have sex enough 
some people like sex to be rough 
they like it pernicious,
in they're kinky ways
while one is on top 
the other just lays 
they will grasp the hair
with quite a grip
with every breath 
they continue to rip 
with all their might 
they smack each other 
while their partner says
""thank you, may I have another"""

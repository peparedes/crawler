I have been with Ryan now for almost 8 months and I think everyday I spend with him is always better than the last.I love laying around with him and looking into his beautiful blue eyes and know that I am welcome wrapped up in his arms. Knowing that he will always be there for me and love me as I do him as well...I wish everyone knew a love like mine cause maybe then there would be less stupid occurances and alot less fighting.I love love, expecially when I am sharing it with Ryan. I love you Ryan and I always will!

Christy is gonna come and get me ON Sunday , I am so excited...I miss her so so much, I love being around my friends, and me being gone all summer really made it hard on me but hey I get to see them now and I get to see Ryan so that is all I need! YEAH!BAM!

 Ryan came over the other day with Jimmy, they brought a movie as usual, but I am not really sure as to what the movie was about or even the title, but man it was good! (lol). I always have a good time with him, as I have said a million times before, but it always seems to me as never enough ,I dont think he will ever know how much I appreciate him or even how much I care. I wish there were a word for it cause I seem I always come short of being able to tell him how much I DO care.The words never want to come out as they sound in my head.... but I guess that happens to alot of people now days.But I do try!...atleast.
I miss him so so much! I wish I could be with him every hour of every day...But..one day that wish will come true:)I shouldn't complain cause atleast I have him and I get to see him as often as I do.<3
In 4 days is will be one month since we first started going out, It doesn't really seem that long but it is awesome and I am so excited!I <3 Ryan !!

He always listens to me whine,and he puts up with all my stupid crap.I have learned from experiance that it is hard to find someone as sincere as he is, and I am so grateful that he gave me a chance to be with him, I really couldn't see myself anyother way ....ever. I hope I get to see him soon!

Yesterday Ryan came over and hung out with us again.I enjoy seeing him so much, I hate it when he has to go home I feel likE I cannot squeese him hard enough or be close enough to him.I like him so much.when I am around him I feel so wanted and I dont care what anyone else has to say,but I guess it should be that way.So NOW I have a boyfriend after all that grief and pain over other boys , but he makes everything ok.and I have never been happier.I cannot wait until the summer is over :-\ I want to be able to see everybody like I use to.But everything will be ok.

I do like to get away once in a while and have a little change, but who doesn't? Citrus County can get a little TOO intense sometimes..there is so much drama, everyone hates everyone and it gets soo old when you listen the same people talk about the same things over and over again because they know nothing else..GET OUT OF CITRUS! heh I find myself doing that too though :( Another problem with Citrus County is that there are so many rude, selfish people. People are so quick to point out what I do wrong that they completely look past everything that they do wrong. People need to learn to tend to there own problems..I am soo tired of having people kick ME down and walk all over me..thats bs and it isn't going to happen anymore..C'MON MESS WITH ME !! :0"

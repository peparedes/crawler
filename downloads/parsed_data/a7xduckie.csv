"event","<P>umm Yea just woke up from my 15 min. nap. DAMN the ppl who call me and wake me up! Now im in pain again... IBUPROFEN HERE I COME. well anyway.. umm yea.. Katie Just left due to Doctors appointment... haha sux for her! j/k im mean! im Uber bored now and im takin these little weird quiz thing-a-magigers... and of course like always listenin to MUziC get low get low get low. Talked to Kry last nite, she decided to call outta the blue so i was like WEeeeeee.... and i needa call Chels and Kitty. i think ima go c a movie with Chelsea today cause theres nothin else to do soooo im makin plans all by muhself here.. haha... typical of me! Shnnnaapp.. Foots asleep!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :-\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ummmm i've come to the conclusion that i am a person with the weirdest personality i've ever met! and for this ppl dont seem to like me much.. haha its gravy tho.. cause... umm cause.. idk y but i'm random. OH YEA! last nite it was soo Funny!! Goosey was hittin on muh friend Katie and Katie was like umm whos this goose than i showed her a pic. and i was like shes a chik! and Katie was like oh wow, but KT is guy-friendly LOL.. so that didnt go well. YO I GOT A FAKE ID THO! i think ima go back to Dance cause my mom says that soccer is too dangerous for me... idk what she meant by that?? maybe cause i hurt myself soo much playin it but still i hurt myself doin anything therefore its kinda odd... I gotta find out if my Bro can take me to Warped soon cause if so i needa get the damn tickets. woot woot hopefully he will take me so my dad wont tweak out that much... he can bring Sandy, Andrea, Oscar, and all his other friends so he wont get bored.. cause i'm for cereal he does not like that kind of music.. LOL... or he can just drop me off and pick me up later on.. without my dad findin out that is.. cause if so He Will Freak and wont let me do anything ever again. that reminded me.. last nite KT was tryin to ""Bond"" with Dave but i would slowly push her away from the comp. and it was funny cause at one point we just started goin at it and she would push me and i would obviously go rollin away due to my rollie chair and than i fell and hit my Guitar and made it all waky and outta tune so i had to tune that nasty mother forker... than i tried teachin KT how to play (the basic Chords and stuff) and she SUCKS it was funny she would play an Em and say it was a C... i was like I GIVE UP! lol than she grabbed my cell and called her b/f and talked to him while rollin on the rollie chair across the house.. Quite entretainin.. haha than we watched Two Weeks Notice and we went Crazee when she was drunk and she was all like ""i can bend like a pretzel! and not just the regular pretzels but the TWISTY kind.. so im a Twisty bobcat Pretzel!"" we were laughin our asses off...SHAKE IT LIKE A SALT SHAKA! <BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""SPANISH-O POEM-O""> </P>
<P>La Vida......</P>
<P>La vida no es acerca de mantener una puntuacion.</P>
<P>No es acerca de cuantos amigos tienes</P>
<P>o cuan aceptado eres.</P>
<P>No es acerca de si tienes planes este fin de semana</P>
<P>o si estas solo.</P>
<P>No es acerxa de con quien slagas,</P>
<P>quien sea tu cita,</P>
<P>con cuantas personal salgas,</P>
<P>o si no tienes ninguna de estas.</P>
<P>No es acerca de a quien hayas besado.</P>
<P>No es acerca de sexo.</P>
<P>No es acerca de quien es tu familia</P>
<P>o cuanto dinero ellos tienen</P>
<P>o que tipo de carro guias.</P>
<P>No es acerca de cuan hermoso o feo seas.</P>
<P>O que ropa vistasm wue zapatos traes,</P>
<P>o que tipo de musica escuchas.</P>
<P>No es acerca de si tu pelo es rubio,</P>
<P>rojo, negro o marron.</P>
<P>o si tu piel es blanca o negra.</P>
<P>No es acerca de que grado hayas obtenido,</P>
<P>cuan listo eres,</P>
<P>o cuan listo crean que eres,</P>
<P>o cuan listo diga tu examen que eres.</P>
<P>No es acerca de a que club perteneces,</P>
<P>o cuan bueno&nbsp;seas en un deporte.</P>
<P>No es acerca de representarte en un pedazo de papel</P>
<P>y ver quien ""aceptara tu escrito"".</P>
<P>La Vida no es JUSTA.......</P>
<P>Pero la vida es&nbsp;acerca de&nbsp;a quien amas </P>
<P>y a&nbsp;quien hieres.</P>
<P>Es acerca de a quien&nbsp;hagas feliz </P>
<P>o infeliz aproposito.</P>
<P>Es acerca de mantener</P>
<P>o traicionar la confianza.</P>
<P>Es acerca de amistades,</P>
<P>usadas como una santidad</P>
<P>o un arma.</P>
<P>Es acerca de que tu dices y con que significado,</P>
<P>tal vez prejudicail, tal vez alentados.</P>
<P>Es acerca de que juicio haces y por que.</P>
<P>y a quien tu extiendes el juicio.</P>
<P>Es acerca de a quien ignoras intencionalmente.</P>
<P>Es acerca de celos, miedo</P>
<P>ignorancia&nbsp;y venganza.</P>
<P>Es acerca de cargar en tu interior amor,</P>
<P>dejarlo producir, y extenderlo</P>
<P>Pero lo mas importante,</P>
<P>es que es acreca de usar la vida</P>
<P>para tocar o envenenar los corazones</P>
<P>de los demas, algo&nbsp;que no ocurre solo.</P>
<P>Solo tu escoges la forma en que esos corazones</P>
<P>seran afectados</P>
<P>y de esta eleccion es</P>
<P>que se trata la vida.</P>
<P>NUNCA le prives a alguien de&nbsp; la esperanza.....</P>
<P>....... esto es&nbsp;toda la fuerza que ellos tienen.&nbsp;</P>"

OH GOD!"" and that just made it worse so i rolled off bed hit the ground hard stood&nbsp; up and streches my leg and Heather was lookin at me really weird sayin ""whats ur problem??"" and i was like...ummm theres something over here ::pointin to leg:: and somethin here ::pointin to lower part of leg:: and than i said ""and its goin ::makin weird chainsaw noise::"" Heather had nothin else to do but laugh wich made me laugh harder so than she made me replay the whole thing again and i was like ok?? but this time she recorded me and i was only to do the little fishy thing in weird accent but than i pulled a something again so once again i was laughin uncontrollably and hurtin myself... 
OOO and in that island theres peacocks everywhere and they sound like mother fuckin loud cats! so at like 5:30am the l0ozer started screamin and i was like <STRONG>SUTPID COWS&gt;&gt;&gt; MAKE EM STOP!</STRONG> and heather was goin crazy hittin her arm casue it was numb and i had no clue what was goin on so i just went back to sleep. after that we once again drifted to sleep when her dad BANGED really loud on the door and walked in takin pictures of us sleepin...twas horrible! 
Well than we went out on da boat and skurfed..and knee boarded! woot woot! i was proud of myself that was my first time skurfin and knee boardin... its just like surfin so it was awesome! than we came back to the island and we hung around than an hour or so later we went out on the boat again and tubed and skurfed again.... i tell u one thing.... i hate damn tubes now! it was really fun tho but i feel violated! that mother fucker and the choppy waves raped me! makes ur ass and hoo hoo hurt! i could feel every single little wave...they were huge tho! lol so when i was gettin back on the boat heather was like so u like it? and i was like yea it was fun and i got quite and interestin butt massage...she just cracked up and i was like ok? lol rite now im sore...my arms hurt from holdin the thingy while knee boardin and skurfin and my butt and hoo hoo hurt from the tube and my legs hurt from runnin with bro..who came into town again and made me run my ass off this mornin after church... he just left 5 mins ago tho...he's an interestin character... 
Outside full of fireworks... ahh i gotta take a leak... ok back well anyway when i came back last nite i took a shower and went to c Spiderman 2.... sweet movie! everyone left me tho... Morgan-Ohio, Alli-Missouri, Chelsea-Louisiana, im not sure if sharpie is gone yet but still Sharpie-Arizona, Cuz-Pennsylvania....im the only lo0zer whos too lazy to go anywhere! oh yea anyway...when i got back after the movie i got on AIM and all&nbsp;i got were problems... am i really that good of a problem solver for ppl to shower me with them? i should be a damn psychologist! i was thinkin architechture or maybe something in the medical field since i already live with one of em dudes..well anyway... when i got on (not mentionin names to be more prudent) this chik was like... ""This dude is really pissin me off"" (the worst place to be is where ur friends with both sides of the problem) at the same time the dude IMs me and he's like ""I'm sad cause i shouldnt've talked to this other chik for 5hrs or whatever"" so im here like umm WTF is goin on???than my other friend was like ""D she broke up with me!"" and i was like who broke up with u? who were u goin out with? and i was just a little confused bastard..so after i got all the info i tried to make things better but i had no clue how, so im here thinkin...
 umm ppl are IMing me tellin me that their b.f/g.f broke up with them and all this shit and im here like umm what the fuck am i supposed to say?? how can u answer that?? ""o im sry theres better for u out there""?? i tired that... welll that just got em more pissed..so dont try it! and yea i mean hell i feel bad for u and im gonna beat the hell outta the other person for hurtin u, but what else can i do??? i mean hell, im a violent little shit and im as shallow as a person can get! and i talked to Superman..but that was interetin cause i had a fever and when i do i get alll WHOA MAN! and i couldnt see that good and i went to  cahnge cause my mom was like take all those clothes off its not healthy and when i took my shoe off like always i threw it and the hell with it..well the damn shoe hit the computer and the comp. tweaked out and froze and i had  to restart it... it was tragic and than Superman was gone so it wasnt a good nite... 
Went to bed at 2:30 and woke up at 7:30 to go to church..came home to find bro here... ran ass off came home took a nap and here i am now. <STRONG><EM>and once again i contradicted myself by sayin that i wasnt gonna xpress my feelings here anymore when thats what im doin at the moment!</EM></STRONG>&nbsp; im a fucktard man! 
I got no one to tell all this shit to cause i would bore em to death or they pry get all ok?? and y are u sayin this? or even avoid me for the rest of their lives..well whatever. im just thinkin that i gotta stop being so nice and carin cause i;m so caught up helpin and being nice that i forget i have feelings of my own and problems that bother the fuck outta me deep inside..well now im just arousin suspicion here by writin all this shit... i think that i might not be as shallow as i thought...maybe even MORE SHALLOW!! and im sore! :-\ havent talked to some ppl i wish i could talk to at the moment and now im just alll blah like always wonderin if i got too attached..?? well im weird but everyone knos that... and now the thought of a fat blunt sounds friendly..... well ok yea aha whatver.. its gravy.
::talkin to self in weird accents:: ""well i dont kno what to do now...i am totally drained outta this world, i am in my own little place rite now.. very interstin and i keep blabbin on about nothin... but i am random like that soo im guessin that perfectly normal... who knos might be phase im goin thru.."" man im weird... i gotta shut up now before my mom thinks i've gone insane if she doesnt already. ::Sigh::"

I grabbed my stuff, rushed out to the cab, lifted the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lady's<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dress, and began to take off her underwear. Suddenly I noticed that<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there were several cabs, and I was in the wrong one.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Mark MacDonald, San Antonio, TX<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _____<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of my shift I placed a stethoscope on an elderly and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slightly deaf female patient's anterior chest wall. ""Big breaths,"" I<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instructed. ""Yes, they used to be,"" remorsefully replied the patient.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Richard Byrnes, Seattle, WA<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _____<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day I had to be the bearer of bad news when I told a wife<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that her husband had died of a massive myocardial infarct. Not more<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; five minutes later, I heard her reporting to the rest of the family<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that he<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had died of a ""massive internal fart.""<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Susan Steinberg, Manitoba, Canada<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _____<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During a patient's two week follow-up appointment with his<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cardiologist, he informed me, his doctor, that he was having trouble<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with one<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of his medications. ""Which one?"" I asked. ""The patch. The nurse told<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me to put on a new one every six hours and now I'm running out of<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; places<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to put it!"" I had him quickly undress and discovered what I hoped I<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wouldn't see. Yes, the man had over fifty patches on his body! Since<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this incident, the instructions now include removal of the old patch<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before applying a new one.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Rebecca St. Clair, Norfolk, VA<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _____<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While acquainting myself with a new elderly patient, I asked,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""How long have you been bedridden?"" After a look of complete<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confusion<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she answered ""Why, not for about twenty years -- when my husband<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was alive ""<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Steven Swanson, Corvallis, OR<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _____<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was caring for a woman from Kentucky and asked, ""So, how's<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your breakfast this morning?"" ""It's very good, except for the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kentucky Jelly. I can't seem to get used to the taste,"" the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patient replied.

To cover his<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; embarrassment he<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had unconsciously formed a habit of whistling softly. The middle<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aged lady upon whom he was performing this exam suddenly burst out<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laughing and further embarrassed him. He looked up from his work and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sheepishly said, ""I'm sorry. Was I tickling you?"" She replied, ""No<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doctor, but<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the song you were whistling was 'I wish I was an Oscar Meyer Wiener.""<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _____<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A physician claims these are actual comments from his patients<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made while he was performing colonoscopies:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. ""Take it easy, Doc, you're boldly going where no man has gone<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before.""<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. ""Find Amelia Earhart yet?""<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. ""Can you hear me NOW?""<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. ""Oh boy, that was sphincterrific!""<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?""<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. ""You know, in Arkansas, we're now legally married.""<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. ""Any sign of the trapped miners, Chief?""<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.

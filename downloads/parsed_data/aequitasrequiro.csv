"event","I've setup a new blog on Blogger and started doing more of my writing there now. I just am not on LJ or MySpace as much anymore and the couple people also on here that I do keep up with I see on a regular basis anyhow.

Things have been going well and the new business is starting to get settled down a bit more and traffic driven to it. Recently my time has been spent researching the engine for Google AdWords and spending more time in touch with a couple local mentors in the industry. Statistically, failure isn't possible for those who stick at it. There's a compounding element to marketing anything and once it gets moving its a juggernaut and doesn't stop. Don't get me wrong, I haven't quit my day job yet but in a few months my income should be fairly well supplemented to back off to part time. A little time into it each day is all it takes.

I'm not deleting my blog, so by all means feel free to still comment if you wish. Otherwise, best just to get a hold of me on one of the IMers."

"event","After being almost completely unemployed the last 6 weeks aside from a few hours at Max Muscle, I've started to get some leads. Most places are still on a hiring freeze, so I've taken on a new business endeavor with my mentor, but in the meantime I still need a day job. So after meeting with him and his wife yesterday to give them massages (they are a couple of the very few people I still do them for, and cash always helps...) <lj user=""geminijedi""> and I decided to stop by Yuki Sushi to get a little dinner. The two waitresses seemed in a bit of a hustle and there was only one chef when there are usually two. Jessi, our waitress, was really cool and talking with her we learned one of the chefs was out with a broken hand and she was working her second 12 hour shift with two more to come. Without hesitation I asked if they were hiring and her eyes perked up a bit with that, ""Wait, seriously!?"" look. So I filled out an application while we waited for our order. I got a call tonight from Ivy (The owners are Charlie and Ivy... unique name pair there) and have an interview tomorrow. Hopefully I'll have a job when all is said and done. One job I haven't had experience with is waiting tables, but I figure if I can deal with Starbucks at the mall with a bunch of people really picky about their coffee, than this should be plenty doable. Plus, how could I turn down free fishy goodness?

Staying optimistic..."

"event","Got it earlier this week as a belated birthday present and I am having some really mixed thoughts on it so far.

Likes:
-More detailed graphics and attention to details such as city streets, buildings, etc.
-Addition of pistols and rifles on top of the crossbows
-Decent selection of weapons, though far too easy to buy the best ones early on by spending a little time at the blacksmith
-Takes much more to move your character's stat sliders (Your character has morality and purty. NPCs have 3 different sliders to affect making it a little more dynamic, though its still easy to get them to sway one way or another)
-Ability to change the colors of your character's apparel and hair
-Larger world to explore
-Depending how you behave in your childhood ""Old Town"" will develop differently and with each comes different extra jobs and shops/services.

Dislikes:
-Annoyingly long load times (30+ seconds most of the time, and they're frequent)
-Sluggish movement and slow camera response
-Only word I can think of to describe the world is ""congested"". Amen for the Golden Road for assistance to navigate the game until you get more familiar with it after oh, 20 hours or so... Otherwise you'll get lost quite easily
-Essentially useless battle targeting system (ie, opponent knocked down, targeted, and melee attacks are swinging at the air instead of dealing finishing blows, unless you happen to do flourish attack just right. Easier to finish off with ranged weapon shots or will attack)
-Will attack charge system laggy when trying to change spells. Makes it impossible to immediately cast different spells consecutively. Better off picking just a couple spells and developing them instead of a diverse arsenal.
-Cannot assign items or attacks to D-Pad buttons like in Fable 1
-Your dog's interaction options always seem to pop up right when I'd rather use a healing potion or some other action
-Apparel has no defense/armor influence? So it strictly for attractiveness statistics... Lame.
-Preview ""cards"" for hair styles, tattoos, etc. are tiny and difficult to see what they'd look like.

Overall:
The game is fun and for someone who never played Fable 1 it will probably have more appeal. Fable 1's downfall was that it was too short, and even the later released ""Lost Chapers"" didn't add a whole lot. That part has been taken care of. I really am not a fan at all of Fable 2's battle system. I feel that it pushes me to develop my character toward being a heavier magic user, which I don't usually like to do. I prefer to develop melee skills first with some magic abilities as support (slowing time, dashing, etc. More non-elemental skills). As for the dog, he's amusing, but I really wish I could just buy a home and have him be a domestic pet a lot of the time. I don't feel that he contributes that much to the game. Maybe part of why its more difficult to take out knocked down opponents is because he's supposed to attack them when they're down. Its interesting, too, that your dog seems to be the only one in the entire world. Hmmm... As for the length of the game, I don't know yet because I haven't beaten it. I'm not totally put off by the game because I do like certain elements of it. However, I feel that it really missed a number of key points that made me really enjoy Fable 1. So, I guess I'm saying that Fable 2 is just an entirely different beast that will probably accumulate a lot of dust on my shelf after 2 play-throughs (once good, once bad).

I don't have an exact date yet, but the rehire paperwork was submitted this morning. For a while to catch up I'll be working 7 days a week between that and Max Muscle. Unfortunately I need the consistency of guaranteed hours and pay until things turn around. Who knows, though, since my career goals have changed in the last 2 years and being back in the Fitness industry is where I've wanted to go for over a year now. Could be a step in the right direction, depending on the light its viewed in."

"event","As I'm making dinner at home, <lj user=""geminijedi""> and <lj user=""takumi""> are headin' out for Boba goodness. Why am I not going along? Well, folks, its diet down time. A bit of an explanation, now...

I'm looking at doing a bodybuilding competition in March. I've spent most of this year trying to bulk up more and get my body to retain the new weight. For those of you who saw me around the time of my wedding last year, I was 173lbs then. I cracked 200lbs on March 4th and have peaked at 206lbs at one point this year. I've learned a lot with regards to making changes in my training and diet, which was typically anywhere from 3800 (maintenance) to 5000 (bulk up) calories per day. Now, I need to figure out how my body reacts at the opposite end of the spectrum and keep the good weight while dropping down the bodyfat. I'm not going down to full contest lean (very minimal, around 3%) but shooting for 7% by the end of the year. I'm going off the diet developed by <a href=""http://www.davepalumbo.com/"">Dave Palumbo</a>, who's should be familiar to anyone who has ever read <a href=""http://www.musculardevelopment.com/"">Muscular Development</a>. Anyhow...

I have 1 weekly carb-up meal that I set aside in the week for Sunday evenings (Replaces my 5th of 6 daily meals), so no Boba until then.

So, in case you're wondering what the whole diet and supplement routine looks like, here ya go...

<lj-cut text=""Dave Palumbo Keto Diet For A 200lb Male"">5:00am - Wake up, Breakfast

8:30am - Meal 2
-Triple Whey x2 Scoops
-1 tsp Glutamine
-1 tbsp Smart Balance Omega Natural PB

12:00pm - Meal 3
-8oz Grilled Chicken Breast
-1.5oz Almonds (Roasted, Unsalted)
-EFA-952 x1
-ThyrX x2
(509 Cal, 55g Pro, 8g Car, 26.5g Fat, 5g Fiber)

1:00 - Get ready and head to work

4:00pm - Meal 4 (Time varies based on daily booking)
-Triple Whey x2 Scoops
-1 tsp Smart Balance Omega Natural PB
(360 Cal, 56g Pro, 14.5g Car, 10.5g Fat, 1g Fiber)

8:30pm - Meal 5 (1 hour earlier if no last client)
-8oz Thin Sliced Sirloin or London Broil, Fat Trimmed
-2c (aka liberal handfuls) Baby Spring Greens Mix
-1tbsp 50/50 Blend Olive Oil and Seasoned Rice Vinegar
-1oz Xango Juice
-Xango 3SIXTY5 PM Packet
-Anabol EXT x2
-EFA-952 x1

10:00pm - Meal 6 / Bedtime
-Triple Whey x2 Scoops
-1 tbsp Smart Balance Omega Natural PB
-1 tsp Vitamin Shoppe Miracle Fiber
-ZMA x3
-EFA-952 x1
-NOW Relora x1
-Valerian Root/Passion Flower x1
(400 Cal, 56g Pro, 20.5g Car, 12g Fat, 11g Fiber)

Totals: 2689.5 Cal, 332g Pro (49.8%), 76.9g Car (11.5%), 114.5g Fat (38.7%), 30g Fiber</lj-cut>

The results? Well, while tapering down my carbs starting on 9/29 and kicking over to the full diet verbatim on 10/1, including the initial water loss I'm down from 204lbs to 192.5lbs. I'll benchmark the exact change in bodyfat Sunday for the second week, but the first week I dropped from 14.1% to 13% burning off 2lbs of fat and putting on 0.5lbs of muscle still. I'm on this regiment for 4 weeks, then I'll re-evaluate.

So, now if you ask me to go out for food and I politely decline you know why!"

"event","""This is by far the best explanation of the Muslim terrorist situation I have ever read. His references to past history are accurate and clear. Not long, easy to understand, and well worth the read. The author of this email is said to be Dr.Emanuel Tanay, a well known and well respected psychiatrist.

A German's View on Islam

A man, whose family was German aristocracy prior to World War II, owned a number of large industries and estates. When asked how many German people were true Nazis, the answer he gave can guide our attitude toward fanaticism. 'Very few people were true Nazis,' he said, 'but many enjoyed the return of German pride, and many more were too busy to care. I was one of those who just thought the Nazis were a bunch of fools. So, the majority just sat back and let it all happen. Then, before we knew it, they owned us, and we had lost control, and the end of the world had come. My family lost everything. I ended up in a concentration camp and the Allies destroyed my factories.'

We are told again and again by 'experts' and 'talking heads' that Islam is the religion of peace, and that the vast majority of Muslims just want to live in peace. Although this unqualified assertion may be true, it is entirely irrelevant. It is meaningless fluff, meant to make us feel better, and meant to somehow diminish the spectra of fanatics rampaging across the globe in the name of Islam.

The fact is that the fanatics rule Islam at this moment in history. It is the fanatics who march. It is the fanatics who wage any one of 50 shooting wars worldwide. It is the fanatics who systematically slaughter Christian or tribal groups throughout Africa and are gradually taking over the entire continent in an Islamic wave. It is the fanatics who bomb, behead, murder, or honor-kill. It is the fanatics who take over mosque after mosque.

It is the fanatics who zealously spread the stoning and hanging of rape victims and homosexuals. It is the fanatics who teach their young to kill and to become suicide bombers.

The hard quantifiable fact is that the peaceful majority, the 'silent majority,' is cowed and extraneous.

Communist Russia was comprised of Russians who just wanted to live in peace, yet the Russian Communists were responsible for the murder of about 20 million people. The peaceful majority were irrelevant.

China 's huge population was peaceful as well, but Chinese Communists managed to kill a staggering 70 million people.

The average Japanese individual prior to World War II was not a warmongering sadist. Yet, Japan murdered and slaughtered its way across South East Asia in an orgy of killing that included the systematic murder of 12 million Chinese civilians; most killed by
sword, shovel, and bayonet.

And, who can forget Rwanda, which collapsed into butchery. Could it not be said that the majority of Rwandans were 'peace loving'?

History lessons are often incredibly simple and blunt, yet for all our posers of reason we often miss the most basic and uncomplicated of points: Peace-loving Muslims have been made irrelevant by their silence. Peace-loving Muslims will become our enemy if they don't speak up, because like my friend from Germany , they will awaken one day and find that the fanatics own them, and the end of their world will have begun.

Peace-loving Germans, Japanese, Chinese, Russians, Rwandans, Serbs, Afghans, Iraqis, Palestinians, Somalis, Nigerians, Algerians, and many others have died because the peaceful majority did not speak up until it was too late.

As for us who watch it all unfold, we must pay attention to the only group that counts; the fanatics who threaten our way of life.

Lastly, anyone who doubts that the issue is serious and just deletes this email without sending it on, is contributing to the passiveness that allows the problems to expand. So, extend yourself a bit and send this on and on and on! Let us hope that thousands, world wide, read this and think about it, and send it on - before it's too late.

Emanuel Tanay, M.D."""

"event","People in this country and the world are seriously screwed up when it comes to this topic. I admit that I was also naive about them at one point before getting into the fitness industry where they are more common and then of course taking time to actually learn about them before I made any more assumptions. I heard about movie <a href=""http://www.biggerstrongerfastermovie.com/"">Bigger, Stronger, Faster</a> and it looks like its showing up in Ft Collins, but I need more information on exactly when. I read a fantastic article in the August issue of Muscular Development (hands down the most scientific based and no B.S. magazine out there for the industry) on the film and it impressed me greatly. Romano, the article's author, was also involved in the movie and can be seen in some of the clips.

Official Trailer:

The best clip though on the site is the one for ""I don't know"" which truly shows the intellect of most of the people in office when it comes to this subject."

You lead a leisurely and relaxed life.  You would prefer to sit back and smell the roses than indulge in high energy activities. You prefer familiar routines and for things to stay the same.  You can tend to feel uncomfortable with change. You find helping other people genuinely rewarding and are generally willing to assist those who are in need. You find that doing things for others is a form of self-fulfillment rather than self-sacrifice, however there are times when you believe that a certain amount of deception  in social relationships is necessary, however you are mostly candid, frank and sincere. People find it moderately easy to relate to you. You have a strong sense of duty and obligation, and feel a moral obligation to do the right thing.<br><br></td></tr><tr><td align=center><nobr>Take a <a href='http://www.learnmyself.com' target='_blank'>Personality Test</a> now or view the full <a href='http://www.learnmyself.com/personality.asp?p=wpa-628330&x=PIx1x159696-160239x63eF0x1' target=_blank rel='nofollow'>Personality Report</a>.<br><br> The best <a href='http://www.luckybestfriend.com/' target=_blank>Buying Pet Gifts</a>. </td></tr></table></center><br>"

"event","So on <a href=""http://bodyspace.bodybuilding.com/trixter747/"">BodySpace</a> I posted a workout that had exercises called ""21s"", which a few people didn't know how to do. I explained it, but also while playing with our digicam realized it takes darn good movies (not conveyed well by YouTube, sadly). Anyhow... I posted the video and got a lot of good feedback on it and some requests to make more of them. So I've made one more and thought I'd share for anyone looking for ideas how to change up their workouts.

Here's the first one for Barbell Curl 21s (Last 3 of 4 sets at the END of my workout):

Then people said, ""Hey, why don't you talk more so we can put a voice with a face!"" so I added a little more on this one. Also, the music in the gym this night was terrible so I put another track over it which I know <lj user=""_skye_""> will appreciate! So here's one for my Shoulder workout:

"event","Most of you remember me a few years back. Scrawny kid that could eat anything (still pretty much can) and still stay small. That was great until I was working at 24 Hour and learned that although I weighed a ""healthy"" 162lbs, I found that I was around 23% bodyfat. Granted, that's less than the average American these days, but to me it was a wake up call. At that time, it had been almost seven years since I'd been consistently active. I'd stopped competitive swimming my freshman year in high school in favor of pursuing performing arts. So the activity level dropped, but the crappy diet stayed the same. I looked at the overall health of my parents and extended family and realized that I needed to take action to improve my own health before I ended up in the same situation. I only get one body in this lifetime and I need to take care of it. Everyone's only young once, but why not prolong it as long as possible?

I tried to get started with things, worked out with <lj user=""takumi""> for a couple months until transportation issues and other things made our schedules not line up. I didn't know what I was doing, but kept experimenting, falling off the wagon for a week or two, then getting back on all the more frustrated. Finally the workouts started consistently in Feb '06 and from there it was no turning back. This morning I hit a major milestone that I never thought I would hit until next year if I was lucky. This morning I got on the scale...

I'm so happy right now! Not only do I feel better than I ever have before, but my self confidence and image has never been more secure. I truly feel like I've accomplished something that's been a direct result of my own efforts. We all have to take control of our own bodies. No one can do it for us. What's even more striking to me is when I look at my old photos from before I started this all. What a change...

So to anyone who thinks they can't accomplish their goals and have the body and lifestyle they want, I'm here to show you that you can. Best part is that this is only the beginning of a lifelong journey. Thank you to everyone who's been there to support me. I hope I can somehow return the favor."

Same chip missing from stomach, though much smaller, and the front of the box is torn. This is getting really annoying. So now I've got 2 statues that are flawed and as far as I know no one wants to buy them. I don't even know if I want to try for a third time, though I just want things done right and to get one that isn't messed up."

Mostly gonna be load a tote, haul it, unpack, repeat versus a lot of pre-emptive packing. A lot of stuff is still in totes from the first move. Just would help to have some extra hands around if anyone's free. Lemme know if you'll be able to help. We'll probably be up early to start the packing and snag the keys as soon as the leasing office opens. I'm sure treating to breakfast, ordering Pizza, Pho for dinner, whatever can be arranged, too.

"event","So since I don't have all my old email addresses on the new computer, I wasn't able to email this to <lj user=""_skye_"">. However, I figure others may be interested as well. Recently I picked up a copy of <a href=""http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/trustybellchopinnoyume/index.html?tag=result;title;0"">Eternal Sonata</a> for the 360 and I've been quite impressed with it so far. The animation style is cell shaded similar to that of the remake of <a href=""http://www.appleseedthemovie.com/"">Appleseed</a> a couple years ago. I'm not very far into the game and have five characters available to me now so far. The game revolves around a dream of Frederick Chopin's as he's on his deathbed. There's historical value to the game, too, as the chapters follow the titles of his various works. As each is unlocked the song will play as well as be subtitled by some historical information about Chopin's life. There's more, of course, but if you're curious just check out the GameSpot video review.

Anyhow, to the main point... As soon as I saw the character of Viola, I knew that <lj user=""_skye_""> would want to cosplay her (...not to mention the pose and peace sign she strikes when she levels up!). What do you guys think?

"event","So <lj user=""geminijedi""> and I picked up a copy or The Orange Box last week, specifically to get Portal on it. Pretty short game (potentially, if you catch on quickly to puzzle based levels) so it only took me a couple hours to get through. However, some of the most amusing lines come from the computer speaking, such as... (To the best of my memory, may not be verbatim)

""We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault was a pleasant one""
""Speedy thing in, speedy thing out""
""...has been known to cause permanent damage, such as vaporization""
""Bring your daughter to work day is a perfect opportunity to have her tested""
""Did you know you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Self-Esteem Fund for girls?""
(In a level intended for military androids) ""Android Hell is a real place where you will be sent upon the first sign of defiance""

There are many others, so if you have a chance to play the game it's a very good one. It's also really good to get someone acquainted with FPS games since it is possible to get through the entire game without being harmed once by any of the turrets. If anyone wants to come over and play sometime, we'd be happy to host! (Just don't mind the mess from still half unpacking/moving...)"

"event","So I just went in for my first interview. After talking for a while and expressing my interest I was asked if I wanted to do a hands-on practical. I'd made sure to dress for this just in case, but was honestly not expecting it to happen. I explained it'd been a while and that I really would prefer to do it closer to my peak level (we'd already discussed that I was going to do a lot of practice to brush up the next few days), but he said he was ok with it knowing that I was kinda rusty. Long story short, I start full time on Saturday! The owner was the first massage I've done in 13 months. Dang I forgot a lot, but was still able to get through it and starting to remember more as I went along. Got some good feedback from him and he said he was sure I'll have no problem getting back in the swing of things. So I go back tomorrow for orientation and then I start up! Kinda like a final exam, I'm gonna be cramming a lot of basics again. So if anyone's still gonna be up for massage work, it'll have to be later in the day, but I need to get a lot in tomorrow and maybe this evening if time allows..."

"event","I resigned from DirecTV this morning. I've spent the last couple days job hunting and submitting a bunch of resumes yesterday. So far I have 3 interviews scheduled for sit downs and if those go well then I'll have a practical hands on interview. Basically, I give a massage and show I know what I'm doing.

On that note, it's been 13 months since I last gave a full professional massage. I need to brush up on my skills and get back in the swing of flow, pacing, etc. so to do that I'm offering to give free bodywork to anyone who wants it until I lock in a position. I need to work on as many body types as possible, so if you and a friend want one that's fine. Just need to figure out when and where, and a means to transport my table if need be (but unlikely unless I can borrow a larger vehicle).

So yeah, if you're free lemme know and hopefully our schedules will work out!"

"event","In leu of recent work crap, I've had things severely turn possibly for the better tonight. Noreen, a classmate from Denver School of Massage Therapy, works at one of the newer Massage Envys out in Lakewood. Massage Envy was founded by a graduate of my school, so the modalities they offer are all in our curriculum. They also don't require national certification, which isn't a requirement in most states as long as you've got an accredited degree and license for that county, and if need be private insurance (~$225/yr). I stopped into one near me and they already have too many male therapists. The Lakewood location just lost a male therapist leaving them with... one. So they're very much in need of a couple more. They also lost a front desk girl. This works for me two-fold. For once, I haven't done a massage in nearly 14 months. My body and mind are certainly not in condition to jump in and maintain the needed focus and endurance it takes to do it full time. So this provides me the chance to work a split between front desk and gradually taking on more clients as I build up to being able to do more and more massages consecutively. The other perk is that if I were only doing work as a therapist I would be making minimum wage when I didn't have a client. In front desk, I can make $8-$10/hr instead, and in that respect I should have plenty of experience to make the full $10 with my time at 24 Hour and DirecTV taking phone calls. The drive wouldn't be so fun, but I know it from when I used to have to work another ten minute drive further at the 24 Hour I managed.

Now for the ideal timeline of events... I emailed Noreen my resume tonight and she's going to take it in tomorrow. I have both Tuesday and Wednesday off in case Sue (the mgr there) wants to do an interview. Assuming that all goes well and I get an offer, I can come back in on Thursday and give my 2 weeks notice, which lets me out right before the wedding anyhow. It also gives me time to apply for and get setup with my insurance and back in practice doing bodywork (I'll let you all know when the free massages start rollin' out!) Sue would already know about the formalities and the wedding, so with any luck that gives me a little more time than I was planning off, hopefully through to the end of the year while <lj user=""geminijedi""> is still on break from school. It would also play out to be making a bit more than I am now and go up more as I could shift more toward full time massage. So I'm hoping and praying this all works out, because it would be a huge stress relief if it does!"

"event","Work has been giving me a hard time about giving me the days off I tried to request back over six months ago. I have ""Floaters"", or basically pre-planned days off, to use before the year's up. I keep getting told, ""You're on the wait list."" or now the stupidest thing is that if anyone volunteers to work 2-3 sundays this month instead of one of their other days each week they get Christmas Eve and Christmas day off. So now I'm told I have to wait until after that trade out's done tuesday next week! I'm mad. I've given them more than enough notice, even repeatedly checked in to make sure it's gone through. I have my team leader's approval and all. I don't understand what's so hard to comprehend about, ""I'm getting married, I won't be here."" Yes, I know a lot of people want time off around Christmas, but c'mon! How proactive do I need to be here? If I don't get a good answer Monday or Tuesday, I'm going to talk to the site director. Yay for open door policies. If that fails, I suppose I'll be looking for a new job since I wouldn't be showing up to work for 3 consecutive days."

"event","So this last week I've been playing a lot of <a href=""http://www.assassinscreed.com"">Assassin's Creed</a> and been enjoying it a great deal! You play as two characters, Desmond Miles and Altair. Desmond is your modern day character working in a lab with a machine called an ""Animus"" that created 3D projections of genetic memory. Yes, ""Genetic Memory"". Much like how it's said that elephants have it and always know where to find water. Or birds know where to migrate every season. In this case (for a reason I don't know yet since I'm not far enough along in the game) the story goes back to the times of the Crusades and the past of his ancestor Altair who was an assassin in that day. The levels are pretty darn big, I must say! It makes up for having to hear the same few sentences over and over every time you pass a beggar, save a citizen from local guard abuse, etc. Not only that, but this is an absolute must for any Parkour/Free-Running fan! Literally, there is almost nothing you can't scale and some of the acrobatics are quite impressive! (Now the ""Leap Of Faith"" moment from jumping hundreds of feed into a pile of hay may be a bit far fetched...) Now, my only complaint with the game aside from the aforementioned redundant dialogue is this:

Twice I have gone to scale a building and gone right through it! Both in my friendly hometown of all places! >.<

Instance #1: In efforts to find all the Masayef (hometown) flags (side mission of randomly located flags. Can't find the last one!) I noticed on atop a building. Stepping back I sprinted toward it to run up it and grab the ledge. Hark, what is this? I have run THROUGH the structure! My, how convenient it is that it's alongside a clif. You can imagine where I ended up. Oh, and no, you apparently can't swim either...

Instance #2: As I climbed a familiar ladder, again to reach a flag, upon stepping off of it I fell perpetually into the nice blue endless fog that looks like a loading screen. Yes, this time I did not horizontally pass through the building, but VERTICALLY! Right through the very ground and falling evermore until the Animus opted to determine I was probably dead, or rather ""Desynchronized"" with my genetic memory and chose to have the courtesy to reload me at the last ""stable memory"".

So yes, for all of you needing a good game that literally gives you the most versatile free roaming and interactive environments I've played, I would highly recommend it! Though you will need a PS3 or 360..."

"event","A couple months ago at my job I applied for a ""special project"" for coaching to work with new hires, so I see new agents every few weeks. With every group there's been at least one or more people who have made some sort of comment or question about how often I workout, do I take supplements, where any good gyms in the are are, etc. Then last week I saw a guy from a previous team I was on who said, ""You just look bigger every time I see you"" and I gotta say that it's really been a significant self-confidence booster. I always grew up the skinny kid. One of those who got the ""Oh, you'll never have to worry about weight"" or ""You're so lucky to have a high metabolism"". I was naive to the fact that size wasn't all that mattered, it was about body composition. I never liked my physique, but I didn't do anything about it. Today I got asked, ""How long have you been working out for?"" and I really thought about it. I had my ups and downs, but really it's been the better part of about sixteen months since I really began lifting consistently (and with any sort of idea or knowledge of what I was actually doing). I look back at my progress pictures a lot to remind myself of just where I've come from. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I'm so much further along than I've ever been before. I'm in the best shape of my life and while I'm not normally one to ever have an ego or outspoken pride about things, I have to admit that in this case it feels good to actually have some. Ya know what? It's ok, too. I don't like the character trait of outspoken ego/pride at all. Much like when you apply for a job or something and hit the ""So, tell me about yourself"" point. I hate that, because I don't like to brag at all. I'm normal just like anyone else. Though today, for the first time I really realized, ""You know, I earned this. I do have a right to be proud of myself"" and it feels great. Bottom line, it's been my own responsibility to myself to get up and go to the gym for each workout. To push myself through plateaus and frustrations when the results weren't coming and I felt like I was going in circles. Until I met GeminiJedi I really had no one to hold me accountable, so I could miss a day or just plain not want to go and make some excuse to myself why it was ok. These days, I have more support and better reasons for why I push myself, but it still goes back to me. It's something I wanted, finally got up enough frustration to slap some good sense into myself, and actually went for it. Now it's coming easier, my body is growing faster than before, and every day I wake up a little more content with myself. I feel like I'm accomplishing something for once, and it's not just fleeting for the week, day, hour, or moment. I'm building the best habits of my life and conditioning the one body I get in this life to be the fittest it can be. Inside that body is a mind and heart that has also become stronger than ever, which is something I never bothered to consider a possibility.

For the first time in a very long while, I'm finally proud of and happy with myself."

"event","President Bush's Resignation Speech:
We all have our disagreements with President Bush.  Immigration, U.S. Attorney firings, Iraq, Darfur, etc. are all hot topics these days.  The following ""speech"" was written yesterday by an ordinary Maniac.  While satirical in nature, all satire must have a basis in fact to be effective.  An excellent piece by a person who does not write for a living.  Sent with the author's permission.
 
The speech George W. Bush SHOULD give:
 
 
Normally, I start these things out by saying ""My Fellow Americans.""  Not doing it this time.  If the polls are any indication, I don't know who more than half of you are anymore.  I do know something terrible has happened, and that you're really not fellow Americans any longer.
 
I'll cut right to the chase here: I quit.  Now before anyone gets all in a lather about me quitting to avoid impeachment, or to avoid prosecution or something, let me assure you: there's been no breaking of laws or impeachable offenses in this office.
 
The reason I'm quitting is simple.  I'm fed up with you people.
 I'm fed up because you have no understanding of what's really going on in the world.  Or of what's going on in this once-great nation of ours.  And the majority of you are too damned lazy to do your homework and figure it out.
 
Let's start local.  You've been sold a bill of goods by politicians and the news media.  Polls show that the majority of you think the economy is in the tank.  And that's despite record numbers of homeowners including record numbers of MINORITY homeowners.  And while we're mentioning minorities, I'll point out that minority business ownership is at an all-time high.  Our unemployment rate is as low as it ever was during the Clinton Administration.  I've mentioned all those things before, but it doesn't seem to have sunk in.
 
Despite the shock to our economy of 9/11, the stock market has rebounded to record levels and more Americans than ever are participating in these markets.  Meanwhile, all you can do is whine about gas prices, and most of you are too damn stupid to realize that gas prices are high because there's increased demand in other parts of the world, and because a small handful of noisy idiots are more worried about polar bears and beachfront property than your economic security.
 
We face real threats in the world.  Don't give me this ""blood for oil"" thing.  If I was trading blood for oil I would've already seized Iraq's oil fields and let the rest of the country go to hell.  And don't give me this 'Bush Lied People Died' crap either.  If I was the liar you morons take me for, I could've easily had chemical weapons planted in Iraq so they could be 'discovered.'  Instead, I owned up to the fact that the intelligence was faulty.  Let me remind you that the rest of the world thought Saddam had the goods, same as me.  Let me also remind you that regime change in Iraq was official US policy before I came into office.  Some guy named 'Clinton' established that policy.  Bet you didn't know that, did you?
 
You idiots need to understand that we face a unique enemy.  Back during the cold war, there were two major competing political and economic models squaring off.  We won that war, but we did so because fundamentally the Communists wanted to survive, just as we do.  We were simply able to outspend and out-tech them.
 
That's not the case this time.  The soldiers of our new enemy don't care if they survive.  In fact, they want to die.  That'd be fine, as long as they weren't also committed to taking as many of you with them as they can.  But they are.  They want to kill you.  And the bastards are all over the globe.
 
You should be grateful that they haven't gotten any more of us here in the United States since September 11.  But you're not.  That's because you've got no idea how hard a small number of intelligence, military, law enforcement and homeland security people have worked to make sure of that.  When this whole mess started, I warned you that this would be a long and difficult fight.  I'm disappointed how many of you people think a long and difficult fight amounts to a single season of 'Survivor'.
 
Instead, you've grown impatient.  You're incapable of seeing things through the long lens of history, the way our enemies do.  You think that wars should last a few months, a few years, tops.
 
Making matters worse, you actively support those who help the enemy.  Every time you buy the New York Times, every time you send a donation to a cut-and-run Democrat's political campaign, well, dammit, you might just as well Fedex a grenade launcher to a Jihadist.  It amounts to the same thing.
 
In this day and age, it's easy enough to find the truth.  It's all over the Internet.  It just isn't on the pages of the New York Times or on NBC News.  But even if it were, I doubt you'd be any smarter.  Most of you would rather watch American Idol.
 
I could say more about your expectations that the government will always be there to bail you out, even if you're too stupid to leave a city that's below sea level and has a hurricane approaching.  I could say more about your insane belief that government, not your own wallet, is where the money comes from.  But I've come to the conclusion that were I to do so, it would sail right over your heads.
 
So I quit.  I'm going back to Crawford.  I've got an energy-efficient house down there (Al Gore could only dream) and the capability to be fully self-sufficient.  No one ever heard of Crawford before I got elected, and as soon as I'm done here pretty much no one will ever hear of it again.  Maybe I'll be lucky enough to die of old age before the last pillars of America fall.
 
Oh, and by the way, Cheney's quitting too.  That means Pelosi is your new President.  You asked for it.  Watch what she does carefully, because I still have a glimmer of hope that there are just enough of you remaining who are smart enough to turn this thing around in 2008."

"event","Been a while, so I suppose an update is in order. I changed jobs about nine weeks ago. I started at DirecTV at entry level customer service. Basically, I just took the miscellaneous calls, or ""Mainbank"" as we call them; billing questions, programming changes, payments, etc. I had three weeks of classroom training followed by two weeks of On-Job Training (OJT). Half way through OJT I learned that people were going to also be trained to take technical calls. Immediately after my mainbank OJT I went back into the classroom for two weeks of Technical training. A few days before completion we learned that it had been decided to make the entire call center into a Technical center, so everyone including new hires would be trained for this. Tech training completed and I'd put in a mini-bid for a different shift that I got and ended up being put on a team that was supposed to have their tech training after mine. One other gal had done the same, so it was just the two of us for the past two weeks. It had its ups and downs, but I have to admit that I did like having a team leader and two coaches available to help out just the two of us tech agents. At the same time, it really allowed us to be watched more closely, especially our call stats (average handle time, hold, wrap, QA points, etc.). I'd graduated OJT with the lowest stats in my class by the end of the two weeks, which is a good thing. Every morning I'm able to see my month to date and previous shift averages. I'm always trying to get hold and wrap (time after calls before being ready to take the next one) lower since handle time isn't quite as controllable since you do tend to get longer calls when you have someone on the line who is not really technologically inclined. Anyhow... I went to Human Resources earlier this week and inquired about other possibilities and ""Special Projects"" that might be available. Special projects are temporary positions in other departments so you can get a feel for if you like it as well as give your supervisors a chance to see how you perform. Your previous position is always there to go back to. This was a strong appeal for taking this job to begin with as a Coach position is one of these projects. With the new call center, a lot of coaches and team leads are going to be needed as the center starts to be more staffed. We only had about 250 employees before we started hiring about another 140 this past week, and there will probably be over 1000 down the road when the center is fully staffed. We'd already had over 3500 applicants prior to posting a new listing a week ago! On that note, there's obviously a demand for the positions. I'd explained how I liked my job, but actually missed the Mainbank calls more. Technical is more one way and instructive. You have to probe more for the issue's source and there is more problem solving involved to resolve it. Mainbank is more back and fourth dialogue like a regular conversation. In a way, I prefer this, though I do like both. Coaching blends these two elements together and I really liked the idea of that. I was told to speak to my team leader and let her know I was interested. Since new shift bids are coming up, I figured I'd do so once they were submitted and I had a better idea of what I was looking at schedule wise and such. Well, today I was the last to leave due to a call running past the end of my shift time. As we were packing up my team leader mentioned that I'd had very good call control and stats today and asked if I would feel comfortable coaching, which I hadn't even brought to her attention yet. We talked briefly and I said that I had done it in the past and would be absolutely fine and willing to do it again. Our team is supposed to have one-on-one meetings next Wednesday and she said she'd have an application for me for coaching then. The application does need to have a supervisor's recommendation along with it, so needless to say I'm extremely happy that this is all coming into place without me having to poke and bark for attention. I have to admit that I'm so very impressed with how the company treats its employees and actually backs up what they say they will do. You're told to just focus on your performance and it will be recognized. I truly believe that all the more now. I'm quite anxious to see what's in store for me over these next few weeks..."

"event","This last week <lj user=""geminijedi""> and I have been re-evaluating our home hunt and refined our search criteria a little. This evening we browsed for more recent listings and came across one that's less than a mile and a half away from where we both are now. It's actually in an even more convenient central location than where we were looking previously. (It's in Palomino Park, for those of you who are familiar with the area) The square footage listed is lower, however it does have a partial basement that I don't believe is being factored into that space. Single bed, two bath, but as a result has a much more open main living space, which looks quite appealing from the pics. It has a two car oversized garage, which is a must for us given our addiction to motorized toys... It's also in a gated community, so always a nice perk there to avoid extra neighborhood traffic. The complex has two clubhouses, two pools, and a fitness center that I've heard is pretty nice for not being a full gym. The best thing about all this is that it's about $75k-$100k less than some other similar places we've had to pass on due to just price alone.

We saw a couple other listings that looked interesting, but just driving through the neighborhood we opted against some of them almost immediately. For now I've sent our agent, a colleague of the agent who helped <lj user=""takumi""> find his home (unfortunately he's now moved to TX), and hopefully we can get to actually see the property up close sometime soon and start to get some more numbers to paper and see just what the reality and feasibility of all this is..."

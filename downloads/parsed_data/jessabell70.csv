"event","Okay, so sorority reports are getting shoved to the backburner tonight.  I'll have them in by tomorrow.  I'm just tired.  And stressed.  APH makes me what to take a hot poker to my eyes.  Ugh, I hate this.  I'm juggling all this responsibility the best I can, but I'm burning out so fast.  School and internship make it hard enough. 

I have no money.  The grad fair is tomorrow.  I have to spend way too much of that non-existant money on all that silly stuff that will last me a whole 5 hours in history.  Honestly, I don't really give a flip if I walk or not, but I know it means a lot to the parentals.  Sometimes it feels like it'll be a miracle if I ever make it to graduation....

I hate feeling all negative about stuff.  I actually had a pretty good day.  It was productive at least.  I'm slowly scratching things off my to-do list, and I'm getting things out of the way.  Tomorrow Mandi is cooking dinner and we're gonna have some quality bonding time.... I just love my big sooo much!



I'm slowly learning that broken hearts don't stay broken forever.... but I'm not sure that once they heal they're ever the same again.  

There are some nights I still really miss him.
But I don't miss the drugs.  And I don't miss the drama.  
I just miss having someone to love me.  But maybe he never really did after all...... 
::sigh::
Letting go is just as painful as saying goodbye."

"event","So I'm going home to Dallas this weekend for my parent's 25th wedding anniversary.  It's not the best timing in the world, considering Hurricane Rita's about to hit the coastline tomorrow morning... granted none of the storm will really hit dallas until Sunday, but that's when I'm supposed to fly back to Steubie.  Hopefully I'll make it out okay, but if it's bad I'll just have to wait till monday or tuesday to come back (ummm, who's really gonna complain about missing class???).  

I'm a little nervous and scared for my family in South Texas though.  Especially my sister and her hubby who are really close to Houston.  So please say a prayer for them guys.... this is hitting way close to home for me."

"event","People are once again defacing Theta Phi Alpha's recruitment posters.  Ugh.

I mean, how absolutely childish can people be?  You'd think by the time you were 20 or thereabouts you'd get over the sick need to pull dumb pranks like that.  What just blows me away is that it happens <i><b>HERE</b></i>.  Welcome to the land of Christianity, folks, where people are not only judgmental, but also rather talented graffitists.  I suppose we're just an easy target, but the persistent ignorance on the part of this campus towards our sorority just angers me.  

But we're stronger than they think we are.  I have the most beautiful, unique, and compassionate women as sisters, and I know that someday people will recognize us for what we truly are."

"event","<I>Just tie the rope
And kick the chair
Just leave me hanging there
Gasping for air
Don't mind me three feet from the ceiling
When I'm with you
There's no point in breathing...</i>

I just want to blow off school for the rest of the week and lay out on the grass and nap.  How beautiful would that be?"

"event","Robert called me at one in the morning.  I had been asleep, so it took me a moment to recognize the number since he's not in my phonebook anymore.  I was so surprised to hear from him.  I had called him drunk on Friday and he responded simply by telling me I needed to ""let go"".  Kinda hypocritical to be calling me three days later.... don't ya think?  

What sucks is that he didn't have anything to say.  He was stoned, of course, which I guess explains why he said practically nothing.  It would have been nice to hear an ""I miss you"" <i>or something</i>, but instead he sounded as if he didn't want to be calling me at all.  I just don't understand what the point of it was.  He managed to rip my heart out pretty effectively though.  My heart jumped for that split second when I picked up the phone, knowing he was on the other end of the line.... thinking maybe, just maybe, he would actually admit weakness and in the process somehow justify my own.  But instead I ended up feeling like he was laughing at me... somehow mocking my pain, my grief, by having none of his own.  

Just when I was beginning to feel like I had gathered the pieces of my heart together again, I feel like he knocked them all out of my hands."

"event","So the truth is, I'm having an affair.  I've been a devoted xanga user for so long that writing in livejournal seems almost like adultery.  But since most of my sorority sisters seem to have one, it's time for me to jump on the bandwagon.  Dearest xanga, please forgive me."

Thankfully, well not so thankfully for the people involved, a tractor trailer caught on fire about a mile or so away so it wasn't anything to worry about other than the horrid smell. Seriously though, what a way to start the day.

This is not a good start to Friday the 13th, but I'm not supersitious...honest..."

She won't be here until later on Friday night but I'm looking forward to it. Looks like it's going to rain so we'll have to change our plans. Ally suggested trying to catch whatever they're playing at the Imax theatre and seeing the Natural History Museum while we're at it. I'm sure we'll find something else fun to do this weekend as well. Now if the week could just be over and then, eventually, for the school year to be going.

At the most we might find out next week in the paper but I doubt it.

On a less ranty note...next weekend can't come fast enough. I can't wait! Of course I have a lot of school work to do between now and then. Maybe I'll be good and get some done over the weekend even though I'm going home for the weekend."

I even managed to do well this last semester in advanced stats which I was afraid I'd have to repeat for a while there (okay, so I panic too easily about grades). I've caught up with a lot of friends and made new ones. I've been a hell of a lot happier than I have in the last few years and it's an absolutely wonderful feeling. I've been writing a lot, which makes me feel productive and happy. 

Now, I need to get through another semester, this one looks to be very busy with research methods, french, and linguistics. Then I need to find an internship or something for the summer. Hopefully I'll get to go on vacation too over the summer. 

Anyway, here's to a good year for all of us. Hopefully a better one for those of you who have had a hard time. *hugs you all*"

Today my grandfather died. It's slowly hitting me but between not really being there with the dementia and barely eating, he was wasting away so at least now he's at peace. My dad called me to let me know, and of course I knew before he said it because we'd been expecting it and I heard his voice sort of break. Then he called my mom and apparently cried when he told her. 

It's odd because I'm so used to my dad being the outwardly strong one when there are upsetting things going on, but it is his dad.

Come to discover she didn't put the polar bear there (my brother did), just as well as the polar bear was leaned over a large mound of snow and suspiciously like it was humping the snow. 

As if that wasn't bad enough...I decided to go find out what other fun images she had in her phone and found a two cartoony images. One was of (what I assume was) two bears hugging although the picture was so tiny I wasn't entirely sure other than it was vaguely obscene. 

Not _nearly_ so bad as the next image, however. This one was of a man playing a guitar (or something similar) and singing to a sheep. This begs the question...Why was this man serenading the sheep? Is he perhaps from West Virginia or New Zealand?  And why is this picture on a phone that also has pictures of a polar bear humping a snow mound and two bears getting a little too friendly? I mean these _came_ with the phone (*coughs* pun not intended, honest.)

I normally don't use the internet in the few minutes before I have to start work, but I couldn't resist making a quick note on the crazy music stuff I've been hearing on the radio lately. Yesterday it was the Christmas music in July. Today it was music CDs for pets. I've heard of the concept before but today I got the joy of listening to some of the snippets from the CD ""Music That Makes Dogs Happy"" or something similar to that.

Let me just say that when the first snippet they play is from a song called ""Squeaky Deaky"" or some such it's all down hill from there. They also played ""I Like It When You Scratch Me"" and ""I Like Food.""

Only...no...it was an an honest to god, by Faranth, Christmas Music...in July...where a good majority of the month has been near 90 degrees.

In our area we have a station that goes from playing it's normal music to playing all Christmas music, all day long, every day from not long after Halloween until a few days after Christmas. No joking, no kidding. 

And no apparently they think we should be hearing nothing but Christmas music in July for a couple of days in a row to help us ""cool down"". I mean I've heard of Christmas in July before, but whoever came up with this idea needs to be smacked."

Turns out the cancer has attached to his aorta and spread to a bunch of organs (although three doctors have looked at it and can't figure out what type he has). We pretty much knew that already but that doesn't make it easier. It's really very sad, even though he was never really the same after his stroke when I was little it's worse now. They say six months although for his sake and my grandma's I hope it's not that long and that he doesn't suffer more than he has to.  

I haven't seen my grandparents since around my 19th birthday. That wasn't exactly the greatest trip (now there's an understatement) and I feel bad that I haven't really had a chance to go back. I'll prolly try and go out for a few days towards August if I can. I was going to go for the 4th of July but I misunderstood dad's plans and so couldn't end up going.

Harry Potter saves children

HARRY Potter stops children having accidents, according to new research published today.

The research shows the number of children being treated in hospital after accidents fell on the weekends that Harry Potter books were released.

Researchers at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford studied attendance records for children aged seven to 15 at the hospital's emergency department over summer weekends between 2003 and 2005.

Writing in today's edition of the British Medical Journal, they say they found that the number nearly halved on the two weekends in June 2003 and July 2005 when ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" were published."

"event","yesterday I was thinking ""You know what, I bet we have a fire drill at one o'clock in the morning"" last night and then I thought ""yeah, right, like they're going to choose tonight just because I thought it"" and what happens?

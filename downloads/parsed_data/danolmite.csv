"event","Have you ever miss someone so much you wish you could call them? Only knowing that your such a big jerk that they don't even want to talk to you. worst part is you can't change the pass only move forward and never forget it. hoping you won't make the same mistake."

"event","I figure since i haven't written on LJ for a long time i might as well start later than sooner. I'm finally starting school again and boy does it feels weird, nervous about being away from home and excited at the same time. What can i say school does that to me. But all i want is to not mess up. It's hard to stay on track, harder to tell yourself to not be a slug and do the right thing. Even worse living in fear that i'll fail. Sad really giving up without even trying. But I ask myself what's worse fearing my future, or not having one. Not everyone can live life the way we want, but we work hard and that's what matters. so come January 9th i'm leaving to the OC for school."

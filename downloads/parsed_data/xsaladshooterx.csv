"event","I don't really like posting on this much. Well, We had this ""Religious Retreat"" thing for our school o_o;; (I go to a catholic school T_T) It was boring.Whatever.
So ,we went back to school and the freaking substitute teacher of my homeroom kept harrassing me-big time! like yelling at me for no reason, and getting pissy because I didn't let him see my ""song"" sheet to the music from the church. I was sharing with a few other people, and he was being a loser about it. He also bumped into me several times and while I was writing he was screaming, ""WHAT'RE YOU WRITING?"" ..I replied:: ""What I am suppose to do. Write the composition YOU just ASSIGNED a FEW minutes AGO.""
I stared at my paper, writing rather quickly in blue ink.
He then pushed my hand, and the pen moved across the paper..totally messing up my final copy.>__>
Then he took out a knife and was destroying a frickin' calender. O_o;
I told him ""KNIVES AREN'T ALLOWED IN SCHOOL"" I shouted, making a scene.
he snickered, ""That rule applies to the students only."" He shoved it back into his pocket, before anyone saw.
Then he said,""It was a tweezer.""


O_o;?"

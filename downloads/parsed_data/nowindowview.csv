"event","in a mood, i wonder if it is healthy, never liked anyone like this. i wonder if ... i just wonder... my hermitage... a safe place, often i know i should step out, but i like it, my fears cant find me there.  But then i never know the reply, and i continue to wonder. Pointless and repetitive, i know, but if i ask, will u think less of me, would it scare you? would i still have you in my life? things i wonder, yet i continuously resort to My Hermitage. Lovely place. 
         Yeah well... LA LA im done for tonight. 
Love ya ,

Toodles."

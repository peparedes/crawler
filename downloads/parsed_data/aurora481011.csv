either way, someone at best buy is refunding me my $200 or else i'm settin up camp in the store and not leavin till i get it. haha i better get my free copy of windows vista sooner than the estimated 17 weeks too."

"event","If it is really anything at all, Tri Sigma is not entirely a flower, national conventions, worn-out songs, bylaws, sweatshirts with letters, or a golden pin. And it is not entirely an institution, a creed, a legacy, an obligation, or a way of life. If you must insist, Tri Sigma is only this:

Moving in with a sister for the first time and learning that beautiful people have fat legs, use mouth wash, and wear last year's coat. Long tired eternity's of drinking coffee and staying up late when you still can't remember your Theology 101 or your Ancient Mythology.

Listening to music, and when your favorite song comes on, having five other people to sing it with, even if you're all off-key. Sitting in the corner and listening with all your heart, because she's lost and she's lonely and it seems that the whole world is just falling apart...

And it's gathering together in a circle waiting for someone who you've seen through her darkest hour to blow out a candle and tell you she is getting married.

And it is, I suppose, a kind of evaluation. You grow up within the chapter and perhaps you do learn more of this grisly ungraceful circus we call life than if you had lived it somewhere else.

You learn a fraternity member sometimes isn't worth the letters on his shirt and that a great man hides behind a boyish guy. You learn that not having a date for formal doesn't mean the end of the world and whoever your date could have or should have been, he is the one missing out, not you.

You learn that library nights are not always for studying and that silent rooms work best.

You learn that the world is made up of people you're going to love, sometimes, and people you're not going to like always, and you have to live with them anyway.

You learn that there's still a lot to believe in and a whole lot more to hope for...

You learn that love is never easy and it is a long time coming. And if you are very smart or very lucky, you learn that no matter how big or messy the world becomes, what is precious and permanent is always the same.

And in the end, Tri Sigma can only be a better way to stumble down the back stairs and out the front door of life."

"event","""Disenchanted""

Well I was there on the day
They sold the cause for the queen,
And when the lights all went out
We watched our lives on the screen.
I hate the ending myself,
But it started with an alright scene.

It was the roar of the crowd
That gave me heartache to sing.
It was a lie when they smiled
And said, ""you won't feel a thing""
And as we ran from the cops
We laughed so hard it would sting

Yeah yeah, oh

If I'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
Now will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learn a goddamned thing.

You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothing to ya

I spent my high school career
Spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes
Sell a car on tv
Bring out the old guillotine
We'll show 'em what we all mean.

Yeah yeah, oh

If I'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
Now will it matter long after I'm gone?
Because you never learn a goddamned thing.

You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothing to ya

So go, go away, just go, run away.
But where did you run to? And where did you hide?
Go find another way, price you pay

Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah

You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothing to ya, come on

You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong,
This never meant nothing to ya

Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now ... here he comes!

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined when you were young

Can we climb this mountain
I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
and see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to

Blame us cause we are who we are
Hate us cause you'll never get that far

Tell me all the places we could go
And count the headlights passing on the road
A long long time ago

Here we are
Foreign to their world
Straight and composed
Your sermons I can do without

We'd make it back to your place before dawn

"event","so, there is nothing to do in piscataway ever. melissa wanted food so i go along with her for the ride. we're sitting in the parking lot and these guys beep at us. we beep back cuz we're smart asses. so maybe 10 minutes later the guys get outta their car and start walking toward us. that wasn't fun at all.

i think i'm gonna go see marc in asbury park on july 2. this all depends on him not sucking on the boat. i don't reall yhave the money to see him a second time however, it will be weird only seeing him once this summer as opposed to the 12 times last summer. will hoge was awesome as usual. i saw jefferson walking out of the bus and got all excited. haha i'm such a girl. i'm adding dean to my list of rock stars i'd liek to screw. i talked to him for like 30 seconds at the bar while i was waiting for my drink. he was way nice. i think it's the butterfly tattoo that does it for me. i'd come close to adding the new guitar player too. however i'd prefer brian.

i'm still debating on seeing the goo goo dolls and counting crows in july."

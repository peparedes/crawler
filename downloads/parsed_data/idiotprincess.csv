"event","i just awoke from a twety-four hour nap. i missed monday...and i had so much i wanted to do! i got to talk to ms hallie for a few minutes today. i miss her so much. i hope she knows how much i love her! 

daddy had his knee worked on yesterday. he is snoring now. 

i am applying to work at this place in georgia over the summer. i will be helping with appeals for death penalty cases! i'm also applying at a couple places in cleveland, though those jobs aren't nearly as exciting! (of course i am applying at these places knowing full well that i probably won't feel well enough to work at all-but i'm applying anyway...) i'm also applying for summer study programs in bangledesh and egypt and isreal...maybe russia too?!

i doubt i will really go anywhere or do anything very exciting this summer. but i might as well pretend that i will be doing something productive...otherwise i'd have nothing to be dissappointed about when summer comes! ha

i hope i stay awake long enough to get stuff done today...i have a lot to do."

i get my IV out at 12 noon. I plan on showering at approximately 1pm.

i plan on celebrating like a mother fucker friday night. even if i have to do it alone...or without the most important people in my life.

i will begin drinking at approximately 9:45 pm at some bar inside quaker square (the whistle blower, perhaps?) 

after that i have no plans 

so what is going on friday night? anything? if not, can someone please come up with something fun for me to do whilst celebrating this momentous event? 

if not i suppose i will come home and work on homework and spend time reminiscing about the life i used to have."

"event","i have a full five grams of ativan in me and. nothin. i am really tired and now i move in slow motion, but my brain just keeps on going and going and going. 
i wish there was a button i could push to turn my brain off at night. I have laid (lain?) in bed now for hours. thinking like this:

i hope i get to see my man tomorrow, if i don't fall asleep i won't be well enough to see him, ugh why can't my parents just let him stay here, why can't i sleep, i hope i get to see him, and i want to go to target and exchange that stuff, and i want to see american splendor, and i need to finish my reading for friday, and i wonder if i am staying in cleveland friday too, if i am i need to pack for it, maybe i'll just pack for the whole weekend and that way if he wants me to stay, i'm prepared and if he wants me to leave, no harm done, i wonder if he would tell me if he wanted me to leave, maybe he thinks he can't because i am presumptuous and brought everything for the weekend, maybe i am suffocating him, i hope not, i like him a lot, and i am very comfortable with the way things are, if it were up to me i would see him every day, but that would definitely suffocate him, hmm i hope he tells me that i am suffocating before i get worse, well i really only see him on weekends so that's not too much right?, i need to finish my bar application, ugh this sucks, i need to go to the bmv and get all my records including juvenile records which i know is gonna be a pain in my ass, i need to drive around akron and get my old addresses, i need to find some way to know for sure when i lived where, i need to find out when i went to a psychologist and what they diagnosed me with, i need to do that for the counselor i saw too, oh and i am going to see a new psychiatrist, so i'll need to include that information, i need to call all my old employers and find out the exact dates of my employment, i don't want to call the student center, they hate me there and at momus too, and i have to call pearl who does student services who i kind of got in an argument with, i don't want to call pearl, some of the places i worked for have closed completely, how am i gonna do all this before november 15, i need to go to the welfare office and apply for food stamps and medicaid, that's so stupid i don't want food stamps or medicaid at the moment, but if i don't go they will cut off my disability benefits, so i guess i should just go do that sometime this week, i should go to the BMV soon too, why can't i sleep, why can't these thoughts go somewhere else, i should get up and read, but my brain is all fuzzy and i am to tired to sift through the language in the cases, i wouldn't retain anything so it's not worth it, go to sleep, please just relax and go to sleep........I can't believe isreal attacked south lebanon today and no one said a word about it, so much for the road map to peace eh bush, he is systematically going to destroy the world, i can't believe they are changing the laws that require every emergency room to have a neurosurgeon, a surgeon, a plastic surgeon etc. on call 24 hours, so what now? i can only have a serious head injury needing brain surgery between the hours of 9 and 5 ""closed early on wednesdays"", god forbid i have head injury on a holiday, i guess that can just wait until the surgeon gets back from his vacation, seriously what are they going to do about this, it goes into affect in november, i think i am the only person in the world who cares that bush is destroying so much good we have in this country, not only the ER thing, but the whole cut in overtime pay and yearly raises for federal employees, people count on that stuff to plan their whole lives for god's sake, speaking of god why on earth is there any debate left over creationism, yikes the people in this country are nuts, maybe i should just get up and post on live journal.

and that brings you up to date on what i think about when i cannot sleep. i suppose i will go watch cnn some more and try to bore myself into a coma."

i wish tHR would come back soon. 
i fuck shit up a lot...and not in that good way.

not only did i get to see the one and only tHR. i got to dance the night away with one mr. adam ""fashion adviser"" searcy. he rocked the dance floor and made all the ladies swoon! 

and since i haven't really updated in a while i thought i would share my good news with the few of you who still read this. 1) I qualified for disability and will be receiving a sum of money each month. 2) I get my damnable IV out in two months! there will be much drinking to celebrate this momentous event.

oh and school starts tomorrow. they say the first year is the hardest; they better be right!"

"event","my puter blowed up. i have no notes for school. i may drop out...well i'd really like to. i can't sleep despite the 5g of ativan i took. at least the cable is back on.  he is asleep. i keep waking him. makes me feel awful, cause i don't have to work tomorrow.
speaking of work...i got a phone call the other day offering me a sweet-ass job, and...i can't take it. cause i'm still that lame sick girl. 

i'm still quite enjoying my homemaking position. i am thinking that i wouldn't mind this so much. 

i am usually the biggest meanest bitchiest asshole in the morning. but i have been so pleasant since i have been getting up with someone else. strange."

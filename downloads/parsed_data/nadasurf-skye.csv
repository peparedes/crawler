Hum what is happeneing todY!!!!
Not much really. Just got out of some awesome weekend with my great boyfriend. 
Went to Stomp for our anniversary and then sort of just hung out around Marks Place. 
Pretty awesome if you ask me. And the show was simply breathtaking...loud but still breath taking. 
:) 


I'm the happiest ... :) 
Thrilled and staying in the city for a tad longer ... then hopefully Boulder will be my next stop! 
2 months until i go to France and 1 month before i find out if I've been accepted to UVA. eh
Louie and I are still looking for a place in NYC so if any of you have good deals get in touch. 
Louie it's gonna be Pimpin to live with you. :) 
 

PS : Check out my new pics!!! on http://arianana.site.voila.fr 
;) cheers mates!!"

"event","This weekend was pretty successful, I must admit. 
My sister and her bf arrived on Saturday afternoon and well of course Ryan didn't come but I find it to be better that way. So on Saturday we went down to Republic on Union Square (that noddle place) of course it was a typical 'place to be' spot in the city so.. full as ever . I totally stress out and force myself to not enjoy my time when there are so many people in one spot, especially a bunch of half naked blondies..hummm oh well. Anyway, after that we went all the way up to Cafe Lalo (You've got mail, ... empty in the movie of course) but yea that was pretty annoying as well. I guess people who have never been to NY rather go to the famous places and stuff.... Yikes. 
Finally on Sunday i saw the Gates and walked around the West Village. 
The Gates really do disturb me. I mean yea I guess it sort of has a cool effect and the color is nice and all but WHY??? It's not like it has a purpose!!! I guess it's.... affordable art or something and a perfect conversation piece. *silence* *silence* crickets crickets 'So have you seen the Gates yet??"" I must admit that i've used that line a couple times this week. Good little starter. Bad taste but still good starter. 
So on Monday the sweet little couple left around 3pm so I watched a movie... no wait 'depressing' movie. ""Life without me"" . Sort of makes you think. :( 
It sucks being alone all freakin week in an empty Sleepy Hollow house. Spooky guys. spooky. 
At least i get to invite my ex Jonathan and his friend to come over on Friday night. That should be fun. 
Jonathan and I are so cool now I couldn't have asked for better. 

I'm listenning to this song from Wilco 'Compagny in my back' Seriously. If you don't have it yet... I dunno what to tell you...oh WAIT a sec...yea 'GET it NOW' It's so great. Wilco kind of gets on my nerves sometimes but this on is especially good."

Ok so yesterday I had pretty much one of the lamest day at work. Although, my boss is acting real weird and happy and almost normal....which is NOT normal. huh. My dad just back from Libya and sent all these cool desert and Camel pictures which totally made me want to get out of this typical NYC building under the rain with all these stuck up people. :p Bleh. 
As usual I got home around 7.40 or so and again my evening was pretty much lame as well. Had Ryan on the phone and the guy might not be able to come with Panda and Joe because of f'n work. 
I always expect that with the Snoogums... not his FAULT!!!! 
Argh!!"

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0);"">ok so it's been a while since I
wrote anything in here. I feel as if my life is somewhat boring and
just don't try to fill up very valuable space with a bunch of well put
together words. Ahhh So here we go. Day after Valentine's day and for
once the world isn't all grey. My friend Paul made me the coolest shirt
in the world. One of a kind. Bright red shirt with a big pink heart in
the middle and it said 'Sorry boys, Paul is my Valentine"" I wore it
around the office ans obviously people thought Paul was my boyfriend
but naaa. Anyway my shirt waspure success!!! I spent the weekend with
Ryan who is more like a boyfriend but we all know our relationship is
very fatalist... still counting the days until we can't be with
eachother anymore. I should be used to this whole running into a wall
deal...but somehow I like being hurt. I don't want to sound all
'doomed' to be hurt until the world crashes but it's true. I was
actually told the other day that I go for people who are taken or live
far away just because I am afraid of commitment and know that it's
impossible. I guess it makes some sense. I'm not too sad about it
because I've always been this way!! Anyway.. Evelyn, Suasan and Ed are
going to Disney world this coming week so I invited my sis, her bf Joe
and Ryan to spent the 3 day weekend with me. This should be highly
entertaining, especially knowing how my 23 year old sis and I act when
the parental unit is not around. pure tards guys!!! She sometimes makes
me think of Jessica Simpson, my mom did say my sis should have been a
blond. JOKING Amanda Panda!!...or am I??? God I love it when it's sunny
and kind of chilly. Sooooooo parfait.</span>"

"event","Last night I went to the Bright eyes concert with my buddy Jonathan. 
He picked me up at my office, we grabbed a bite and you know headed towards the Town Hall. Wow, never have i seen so many emo's... and I thought Death cab for cutie was bad. In the queue I messed up my hair quite a bit just for the hell of being one of them. lol I think Jon was a bit embarassed, but I was happy and didn't really give a damn. So we finally got in, Jon went o his seat , i went to mine (accross the room from eachother) and we just sat there waiting for our emo's to sit down. The first band was quite different. This girl used tap dancing shoes to make music and i thought that was grand!!
The second group was from Paris, and even sang in french for one song...that made me feel close to home. Just what i needed. CocoRosie is the name of the group. They were excellent, i even HAD to buy their CD. 
Oh and finally came Bright eyes....and guys...I'm in Love with Conor. He's so cute and weird and dorky =hahahahha....sounds attractive huh?? 
hahah for his last song that he recorded with Beethoven 'we practise in my parents basement sometimes' ...aaawwww, anyway yea he just went crazy. I couldn't believe it ...he climbed on the drums and crashed and made everything fall and the drummer was still playing. MY GOD!!!!!!! That was amazing!!! And of course since emo's don't show their feelings I was the first one to stand up and YELL on my side of the room. AHHHHH such a good fan!!!
So that's that. Once i got on the train , I felt so relaxed and satisfied. I played my new cd , sat back and enjoyed!!!
When getting off at Tarrytown i saw this group of 3 teens just sitting in the train and I could just tell they were at the Bright eyes concert. We kinda of looked at eachother and said 'Bright eyes??' 'Yea, totally' ...those words meant so much: 
- 1st of all: yea you are def cool in my book. 
-2nd:This concert just blew my mind!
-3rd: we like the same stuff, let's hook up!!
Well almost...lol I just said goodnight and left.
Got off the train got a cab and went home!! crashe din my bed at 1.30 woke up at 6 and now I am so wide awake. 
AMAZING!! I'm just super happy and feeling great!! 
So mister JJ don't bust my mood!!! :)"

"event","Yea so my weekend was pretty lamo. Ok so half of it was pretty lamo. it wouldn't be a nice thing to say that the whole thing was pretty damn bad. So Yesterday, I went shopping con mi amigo...Paul. By the way, thanks buddy for telling me what was ugly and what was NOT...oh and for holding on to my stuff, and for accepting to come in with me in Victoria Secret. Oh yes and 'Love spell' was def def the one i was looking for. :) 
Anyway, i got a couple cool things with the 300 dollar gift card the firm gave me. OH RAMSA!!!!! (mi amor) 
Right now I'm at work and and it's crazy how I'm always the first one here. :) 
God Harj Barj is not coming in today???? BOOO Harj! BOOOOO.

"event","Ok so here we go. 
Gosh I really don't know how to start. 
So here i am, Saturday night, by myself. I feel like an unsociable nerd but...yes yes there is a but, it's snowing like crazy and I can blame it on the gods of nature (Damn you!!!) :) 
My day consisted in just lounging around, sleeping and watching TV. It sucks not to have a car and the licence that goes with it. I would have gone to the city but nahhh, wouldn't want to get stuck down there. 
I can't wait to start college. get out of this place and live the college life. 
I don't mean getting  drunk , layed and the whole package... i mean the atmosphere and just being able to meet new people all the time. When you are in College there is no excuse to not go out and have a blast. 
nope nope. 
Before I know it I'll be back in France, fully enjoying my vacation, go to my mom's wedding and see my friends. 
Ahhhh. 
On the men side here: not happening. There's something about this place that turns me off. 
I just have a feel that people in general here are too full of themselves....i could be totally wrong, but American boys are just horny bitches. i guess sometimes it could be good."

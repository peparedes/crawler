"event","All I ever seem to post here is problems. Sorry for the lack of happiness folks, my life really isn't that bad, this' just the only way I can release my anger...

In todays installment the issue of love comes up. Not actual love, more like infatuation, or puppy love, or whatever you wanna call that. In any case- Rawrg I dunno what the hell I am saying. Time to start over.

So, I found out this weekend that a girl I like, and whom knows I like her because I asked her out once before, has finall broke up with her boyfriend. First thing - she rejected me before because she had just gotten together with this other guy, so thats why I asked again. She even said she probably would have said yes if I had asked sooner.

Alright, now to jump back further than this weekend, because this ramble is just to get my feelings out and to hell with anyone actually trying to read it and make sense of this jumble. No offense.

Both of these people went to me to ask about the other whilst they were dating. The guy, who I had met after they started dating, wanted my advice on how to make her less angry with him. The girl, knowing I liked her, asked me what I thought of her guy. What the hell? What the hell again!? THAT&nbsp;DOESN'T SEEM&nbsp;RIGHT&nbsp;TO&nbsp;ME! So, yeah, I'm too pussy to just outright refuse to help either, so now I have to give advice to the guy, and actually provide feedback on whether the girl should dump said guy. -_-

Of course, I get this stuff like... 2 days after I start looking around for a different girl, which of course puts that on halt as I ponder whether, maybe, she likes me and that might be why she is asking my opinion. In any case, I answer her as truthfully as I can to any of her questions, and lalalala. Brawrg.

So, back to today. I walk her home from aikido because she has no ride. We talk the whole way, most of it is her opening up about whats bothering her, and genuine emotions and stuff. I try to give her advice on school, work, extra-curriculars, all that. Oh, and the new guy she likes, and how her mother probably won't like him. Why the Hell did I have to comment on it? Why couldn't I have just skipped that part of her worries. Or even better, be&nbsp;selfish and advise her to not go out with him? Why the fucking HELL did I have to tell her that its no one's business but hers and his?



Thats not what I'm even angry about. Well, it is, but its just a symptom of the real problem. I told her I wasn't gonna go all emo if we didn't go out, way back in early September. I had prepared, and not gotten my hopes up, and if it weren't for all the other crap that happened that same day, I'd have been fine. Hell, I told MYSELF&nbsp;I wasn't gonna get super crazy about her, that that type of crap can come if we start going out. But no, didn't listen to myself, I got my hopes up, and got them crushed. I honestly aren't mad at anyone besides myself. Yeah, I'm ready to punch a fucking wall now... ARGGGG!!!

"event","<br />So last night, right 'fore I went to bed, I was surfing the net and talking with a couple friends. I started reading this article, a really wierd one... Anyhow, the author went into a near death experience from when he was in high school, where he was sitting on the filter pump underwater, and it started sucking his intestines out. Yeah, he almost drown AND got pulled inside out. I'm not sure how it ended, because I closed it.<br /><br />But, after I closed it, I got lightheaded, like I was holding my breathe. Then, my eyes unfocused. I felt a little quesy, so I got up to go get some water, and found myself almost completely unable to balance. I ended up laying down a few feet from the computer where I had set up my temp bed, and just layed there. The experience I had just read went through my head and I felt as if the whole thing was happening to me. After about twenty second of shaking and banishing the whole idea, I got up and was fine.<br /><br /><p>First time this' ever happened to me, and if it ever happens again, I'll be getting it checked out by&nbsp;a doctor. But oddly, I want something like that to happen again (though not with the same... Subject?) just because the emotions I felt at that time were entirely pulled from the situation I was imagining...</p><p>Anyhoow, in other news, I also dreamt of ROTC a few days ago, back in day of yore. Senior Chief told me that I'd be a great staff officer if I focused instead of goofed around so much. Huh.</p>"

"event","<br />But probably not for long. I just need a place I can write all this down, and in lieu of a physical journal, this place gets to be it.<br /><br />Woah, dizzy spell...<br /><br />Friday, sucked. Horribly. I woke up at 1 am, after going to bed at 11 pm, and didn't manage to get back to sleep. I felt horrible. Sore throat, coughs, chills, random nausia<br /><br />I found out I need a 4.0 GPA this quarter of college to continue recieving financial aid. And, we're moving a week into the quarter. I'm fucking doomed.<br /><br />My bike got a flat tire, so I had to spend time getting a new intertube instead of going to howerth. No salt water swimming to make me feel better :&nbsp;(<br /><br />My paycheck was a good two hundred dollars shorter than I thought it would be, so virtually all of it was going to go to rent.<br /><br />I had to listen to Bailey lament about her troubles with love, and&nbsp;anything I could think of&nbsp;to tell her, I couldn't&nbsp;because I promised Julian&nbsp;I wouldn't. Normally helping people out is all good&nbsp;for me, but not&nbsp;this thing, it was just plain bad for me.<br /><br />Thursday I had&nbsp;messaged Deirdre. I like her,&nbsp;and I had wanted to tell her in person, but it'd been three weeks since I had last seen her, and I wanted to get it off my chest. Friday night after swimming I checked my message. More on this in the next section of my rant.<br /><br />My bike fell apart down&nbsp;the hill from&nbsp;Matt's,&nbsp;the&nbsp;rerailer lodged&nbsp;into my spokes and bent it. I can't fix it because I don't have the funds to buy a new rerailer.<br /><br /><br />I got as&nbsp;close as I ever have to&nbsp;a breakdown that night, stuck down in riverside with Matt and Julian. I didn't even talk when I got to Matt's house,&nbsp;I just zombified, putting myself in my own corner until I fell asleep.<br /><br /><br />Nobody even knows the whole story of that day, cept&nbsp;whoever reads this. I'm fucking miserable.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And&nbsp;Deirdre's&nbsp;message back. I was prepared for a not interested&nbsp;reply. I wasn't prepared for a &quot;I was until recently&quot;&nbsp;reply. I can't fucking believe it. I waited probably less than a week too long to ask her out. I fucking hate my luck. I shouldn't even have opened that message&nbsp;Friday.<br /><br />Today I talked to her some,&nbsp;I really would rather have her as a friend... But I feel like I have to act like I'm not hurt, because I told her I wasn't going to act emo about it. And I don't wanna. But the idea that ... I&nbsp;absolutely hate my life right now. It hurt to talk to her, and her last IM &quot;It was nice talking to you Tyler,&nbsp;if only a little&quot; almost brought me to tears. Seriously, I have no idea why it effected me so much.<br /><br /><br /><p>I haven't talked to anyone about this, its just building up in my chest, hopefully this entry'll help.<br /><br />;aoisdhr8paetha;igjapo4/erypaw843otriyahse;roailefk rawrgggggg<br /><br />Sorry, for the emo rant and the string of gibberish there. I need to sleep, but the floor is the only place left. I hate my house.<br /><br />G'night everyone.</p>"

My simple plan is to, as soon as it happens confront them. It was more complicated when I had a network of friends that lived nearby, but now that I am away from them all, its simply going to be to get out there as early as possible (meaning less zombies) and kill as many of them as possible. Yeah, I'm gonna die (hopefully slowly enough to prevent myself from re-animating), but I'll have given others a higher survival percentage. Heck, if everyone did that, the outbreak wouldn't grow large enough to be a significant threat to everyone...<br /><br />Blunt object, by the way. Probably one of the bats I have at my house.

Math looks like its gonna be the same regurgitated&nbsp;algebra I've been ""learning"" since 8th grade, only with all new terms for the stuff. Woopie. And The professor is even a high school teacher! Yay me!

If I have to learn about exponents or variables in Math131 next quarter, I'm gonna strangle myself. Twice, if they've renamed the terms by then. I just wanna take physics, but nooooo. I need math classes to do that. Pfft."

"event","<p>My internet is here at last! I know, its been forever, right?<br /><br />Lifes been different lately, as I move into another stage of my life. DnD is out for the moment, which is cool, cause there is sooo much else I can be doing with the time. Like this weekend, yo. I hung out with, like, everyone (well, except Jon, miss you buddy!) and it was awesome. Shawna and Dani came down to Everett with Jordan, who is pretty cool to hang with, and an awesome driver. I guess we met back awhiles (haha, i only remembered after he told me. I knew his face was familiar!)<br /><br />So, yeah, I'm getting a job on-campus for my college, in security in the fall, till then, I'm gonna see if I can get a job in the warehouse there. Borders is still awesome, except the cutting of hours and the long, expensive commute. I think... Well, I might have to move on, but hey, new experience is everything I am about right now. I'm getting the need to just, like, shuck stuff and move on.<br /><br />Which, by the way, is kinda making me and Matt (or Karen) butt heads over. he's the exact opposite, he likes familiarity and habit, which I am always trying to get rid of. Not quite the road less traveled, more like the path I haven't seen yet. Arizona tea is my new passion of drink, even though no peach tea is sold anywhere :(.<br /><br />Oh, and with the good weather starting to roll in, I'm gonna get some decent gear so I can go camping. And hiking. And beach bon-fire-ing. It'll be sweet. And everyone is invited (haha, I'll prolly need a ride to the place anyhow).<br /><br /><br />I'm gonna stop with the purging of junk food every weekend, cause I'd really like to see how being a firefighter is. I have two years this August to work at it, and that should be enough time to get my schoolin a bit of the ways done. Oh, yeah, did I tell y'all? I am officially going to college on the first of July for my first class. I'm taking Algebra and Psych for my first quarter, and plan to attend every quarter till next summer. Then, well, we'll see what life is like for me next year, huh?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So, sorry y'all I've not been hanging with, We'll hang soon, and Jon, I'll catch on IMs sometime.<br /><br />Peace out</p>"

"event","So, I'm not going to college this spring.&nbsp;I&nbsp;hate that more than I can describe.

I guess one of the forms I filled out to recieve financial aid&nbsp;had a mistake or something, and didn't get through, so I can't recieve&nbsp;aid. I could have had all the money I needed for this&nbsp;quarter if I had not had all of my paychecks&nbsp;used up paying bills that a certain asshole should have been paying. Seriously, I haven't gotten more than 70 bucks from a single paycheck&nbsp;since, I unno,&nbsp;November?

And now I'm also moving in the next week down to Edmonds. So I can live&nbsp;next to a college tht I don't get to go to for another three months. Yay for the meaningless 4 hour daily commute! I absolutely hate that my college classes are being delayed.



That being said, I talked to Dani today. Or am talking to... Something like that. In any case, its the first conversation with either her or Shawna I've had since what? Last Jon was here? So, I hear finally that my closest group of friends has broken up for the forseeable future. Which sucks. Dani and Shawna, heck, they helped me a lot when Krystal left me, Bryan stopped talking to me, and I was hating my job, waay back in September. And Jon, well, he's always been the best friend I've had to hear another viewpoint from. So yeah it sucks that the two groups (well, I guess Jon isn't technically a group...) probably aren't gonna talk anymore.

Well, guess I should get back to packing up my family's crap. For myself, a single box of books (to be given away when I sort out which ones are my uncle's that I am borrowing) and a box of elephant knick knacks (my grandmother's collection) is all I'mm keeping 'sides a pile of clothes and my 360. Its liberating to be throwing away all the other crap I have laying around, especially since I finished my packing in like... 5 minutes? haha, well, off to the kitchen!"

I always have all these great things to say, but by the time I get to people I wanna say them to? yeah, don't remember a thing. Like two or three quotes today that would've been nice to remember... But nope, of course not.<br /><br />So, haha, I got called stupid by a customer today, three minutes after I was suppossed to be off, because I couldn't locate a book that wasn't in our computer servers. It's really stupid to get angry bout that type of stuff, I tell people that all the time, but its still something that irked me to no ends. I wanted to challenge him to a duel or something, I unno. Guess I just need to say it here, it already feels better. Stupid old people.<br /><br />Anyhow, in other news, I was also late today, which sucked also. Annnd, now I am sitting at home with nothing to do. Cuz I have to be home, yet no one is around to socialize with. It sucks, pretty much a lot.<br /><br />Oh, and I haven't really talked to Dani or Shawna since the whole thing happened a while back. Which sucks. I keep wanting to say whats up to Dani, but she seems to be in a pretty bad mood lately, and I dun wanna bug her round then. And Shawna, well, bleh. I unno.&nbsp; She's kinda hard to talk to, since she never seems to be on.<br /><br /><br />Meh, that pretty much sums up my life, I suppose. Haha, yep.

So eat that!<br /><br />Haha, I also played a bit of SSBB at gamestop while waiting for my friend to get off work. It was pretty fun, way different than the other ones, at least as far as the story mode goes. I rode the bus to Everett Station, and asked my friend if she'd like to go to Sakuracon, since she likes anime and I wanna go, but she'd rather play video games, haha.

I've asked you both what has been happening, and haven't got an answer. So, yeah, I have biased facts, and its gonna effect how I think of the situation. And, its pretty much nagging at me right now.<br /><br />So, Jon has never struck me as unreliable. Yeah, he's gonna act a little wierd, cuz he freaking out, because you broke up with him (yeah, arguably you two were never going out, blah) and immediately had a boyfriend. From an entirely impartial viewpoint? Suspicious. And yeah, Jon is hurt from it, he could hardly stop talking about it for days. And I would probably be the same. From his point of view, that he's told me, I can understand all of his actions, they seem entirely natural.&nbsp;Abd to imply that he isn't a ""good person""? There is no way I could understand that.<br /><br />The point is, he's my friend, I disagree with both these labels, and its not right for me to not voice that, even if I said I was going to remain impartial.

Perhaps I should do that. Oh, how I lose things. Like my wallet. Oh, cept that wasn't lost, it was taken by an immature asshole.<br /><br />Yeah, I got in a fight with my mom's boyfriend over my door being open. Retarded, huh? But yeah, he sits on his lazy ass all day, without working at all, and doesn't talk to me unless its yelling at me to do something. I don't respond to commands. If I wanted to do that, I could have joined the Navy and gotten paid to do it. And I especially do not respond to them if the one doing them, contributes less to the household income than I. So, he was pissed that my door was open ajar, and yelled at me to close it. I flatly refused, telling him I'm not going to do something if he's gonna yell at me for it. He can ask like, oh, I dunno, a civilised person. He took offense and yelled (again) that he does do that.<br /><br />Long story short, I one (yay for being able to use intellect in arguments) and his response was to <em>take the door off its hinges.</em> How the hell does that help him? You know what I did? Left it there. Two days pass of silence, and magically the door reasserts itself on its hinges. He's a dumbass if he thinks something I didn't care about... Can possibly compel me to do anything that I don't want to. But yeah, now he stole my wallet, which had the grand total of 8 dollars in it. Big whoop. It'll turn up eventually.<br /><br /><br /><br />Otherwise in my life, uh... Well, not much. I am almost bored with Borders, there is not stress at all, no anything. It's just kinda a slow, easy day every day I am there. Most of the people there are cool to talk to, actually, all of them. They're all book worms and half of them play D&amp;D or some other tabletop rpg, which I think is why everything is very low key.<br /><br />Except the cafe chicks. They seem a bit more ""fun"". Sarah and meggan are both cool, and we regularily exchange joking insults to each other. They seem better at it than I, however...<br /><br />Anyhow, I do believe I might ask this one girl out. Maybe, dunno. First time I've seriously considered the act in... Well, months, partially because every girl I've been interested in has been taken. But yeah, maybe, maybe not, depends on my thought from now to then. Whenever then might be.<br /><br />Peace off!&nbsp;I mean, peace out!&nbsp;<br /><br />PS: thats from some Canadian News Comedy Show thingy, kinda like the Daily Show. Yeah. I found it funny. Just say it out loud.</p>"

All I do know is that I have heard both of you, in person, express love towards the other. Yeah, and not the ""I love pizza!"" type either.

"event","<p>Hi buddies!<br /><br />I am completely lackluster with my calander thingy, so until it offers a mission I actually find cool, I'm taking a break. Yep.<br /><br />Also, signed up for classes during the weekend for college. Philosophy and psychology is looking like the main classes for the semester, with possibly a couple theater ones&nbsp;as well&nbsp;(to be specific, scripting and improv). Dunno, a lot of the classes I wanted are multi-semester, and the first installment t'ain't being run this semester. Taking the placement exams tomorrow, but I'm pretty sure they'll be a cake walk.<br /><br />Otherwise, nothing much is happening. I'm growing out my sideburns, and am actually going to cut my hair, rather than shave it. So, yeah, new look coming up I guess. Until I get tired of it an shave it off anyhow.<br /><br />NERD ALERT: This week in DnD, my caracter died. bleh, boring as hell when that happens, even if Karen wasn't there so I got to play his person. END ALERT<br /><br />Miss y'all, we'll have to hang sometime soon. This or maybe next weekend? Eh, we'll see. Peace out yo.<br /><br />PS: Pancake day. WTF, I don't wanna make freakin pancakes for a challenge. Then there was psychic day, then impossible pizza day (I had regular pizza that day). Yeah... No thinks.</p>"

And, I apparently am way below average...<br /><br />So, all that happened yesterday really, was that I met Karen's girlfriend/ex/love interest something. Yeah, I don't believe they are going out anymore, but she sure flirts with him plenty, and he is crushing on her super obviously big time. Yep. Annnd... Well, thats all. Talk to ya'll laters.</p>"

"event","<p>Or at least still moving...<br /><br />So, hey, newsflash: I just now found my calander like... 6 minutes ago. Yeah, hence the lack of posting, cuz, well, nothing's really been happening. So, first whats been happening, then what I missed on my calander.<br /><br />Uh... Last week, nothing really. I still have a boyish crush on the 22 year old, red-headed, <em>taken</em> cutie who works in the cafe (her name is Sarah. See? I know it) but I've pretty much determined that it would be a horrible idea to ask her out, even if she didn't have a boyfriend. I found this out by talking to her a couple more times (we just haven't been having the same shift, grr). She's even more awesome than previously thought, but just is heading in an entirely different direction than I (not to mention different state). So yep, I'll just be friendly and happy with it.<br /><br />Otherwise, DnD was this weekend (nerd time alert!) and all I have to say is that intelligent ferrets are awesome. Mine gleefully jumped a dinosaur skeleton the size of a house and attacked. Yeah, all that could have made it better is if the spell it was using had worked, and made the thing run away.<br /><br />I got yelled at this weekend, for something I shouldn't have. It sucked, and I have to say that I am not apologizing for it. Screw her. I already yelled at my (physical) journal about it, so I won't do it here, I guess.<br /><br />Which brings me to this: wtf am I doing with two journals? I mean, sure, this one is fun to rant into, but the physical one is just sad for a guy to have. Guess thats what happens though, when stuff happens. Heh, at least no one knows about the other one. Ooops.<br /><br /><br />Right, and so, the missions I failed by default:<br /><br />Damn, last weekend was a good one. Apparently, I was to write in to the queen, requesting to become a knight... Well, I totally should have! This one time, I totally saved the royal pet. By which I mean a spider I found that my sister was going to crush.<br /><br />Monday the 18th: Walk barefoot on grass. Damn, I coulda done that one easy... Stupid shoes... Anyhow, grass is supposed to relax you by putting morphine into our blood.<br /><br />Missed Tuesday's, which was write a journal entry. DAMN!<br /><br />Wednesdays turned out to be defy superstition. Meh, not the worst day to miss.<br /><br />Haha, count sheep to fall asleep... Okay, yeah, it even gave a tic-off area for it. WTF? How am I suppossed to csleep if I am ticking sheep off?<br /><br />Friday was... Make people notice me day. Huh, well, didn't entirely succeed in that, but I didn't shave that day, like the thing reccommends.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alright, this weekend I was suppossed to have looked up life in the dictionary... To find out the meaning of life or course!

And since then, I haven't looked at it, so I haven't done anything else. Go figure. Bleh.<br /><br />The weekend was pretty busy anyhow.&nbsp;This one guy who is alright<em>,&nbsp;I guess, </em>showed up from California. So, of course, his two favorite fan girls and a couple other guys, as well as me, went to see him land. Haha, jk, you all know your my buddies. Anyhow, Shawna, Dani, Austin, Jon, and I hung for pretty much the whole weekend, doing all types of crazy hijinks and whatnot.

Seriously, it like, sucks you in or something.</li><li>Me and Alex made a kick ass ax out of stones, sticks, and grass. It had&nbsp;a special function that allowed it to be quickly transformed into a club by tapping the ax head against a hard surface. I know, advanced, huh?</li><li>I also found out Alex is a pretty damn good wrestler. I didn't even realize how the hell he pinned me, but he did. Also, Jon and Shawna seem to like to wrestle each other. Huh.</li><li>Jon's mom is still like... Super nice. Though I made her a bit irritated when I beat her at arm wrestling. Mwahahaha.</li><li>And yes, might be updated later. As I think about the weekend. At the moment, I wish I could go to sleep, but I have work.</li></ul>"

"event","<p>Hi again!<br /><br />So yep, waiting for tomorrow cuz duh, I get to hang with everyone. Which is awesome.&nbsp;Annnd, yeah!<br /><br />Yesterday was a very odd day. First off, my mission was to order something and then run. Well, actually, it was to not pay for my food, but I wasn't gonna do that. So, of to the italian garden I went, sat myself at a table, asked for some water, and poof! I was gone. I kinda felt like&nbsp; jerk, but at least water is complimentary, right? So, before that (rewind, if you will) I got to work at ten, all nice and happy (and clean!). I ring the bell to get in, cuz the store doesn't open for another ten minutes, and one of the service managers comes to answer. I saw ""morning"" we have a short discussion on him having a good one, then he tells me I was suppossed to be there two hours ago. I was like ""wtf?"" I'm not in trouble or anything, but I could swear I was suppossed to come in at 8 the NEXT morning. Anyhow, I go through the day, making up time easily (I was still kinda pressed for things to do by the end of my shortened shift), and then nothing else that I could really explain happened, but be sure that it all felt wierd. I think it was the hair, I was having a good day for it (which, yeah, is wierd for me. Hence my normal shaved look).<br /><br />Well, I better head off to work now, see you all tomorrow!</p>"

Don't believe me? Try it. Start small, try working for an hour without using your thumbs. Yeah, not easy. Or, try lasting five minutes without the use of your eyes. I've done both, the thumb thing wasn't the hardest (its kinda fun) but the eyes thing is scary as hell when you're walking someplace. And the silence thing, man, I would hate not being able to express myself verbally.<br /><br />So, nothing much happened today (or, actually, yesterday, as it is now), I just hung out and pantamimed at Matt's (or Karen's, if you like).

"event","<p>And never materializing update. Heh, sorry, I didn't really do any of the challenges since Thursday (which was, by the way, eat only asparagus day). I didn't wanna do that, and I was a hermit on friday, so I couldn't really be all secret agenty. The weekend, I tried to control my dreams, but all that led to was not even remembering what I dreamt about. And today, well,&nbsp;demanding (even in a small way like the thing said) just isn't me. Oh well. Tomorrow (or today, really) I just won't talk, and then I'll be back on track.<br /><br />So, my life since the last update isn't really all that big of a change. There've been two girls that I dug a bit since September, and as it turns out, both are taken. Bleh. One was probably too old for me anyhow, even if I totally dig her. We talk on the bus whenever we get off at the same time (she works in the cafe at Borders) and yeah. She's pretty cool in the hippy persuasion.<br /><br />Speaking of Borders, I saw Bryan there today. It was totally random. Met his new girlfriend, and we chatted for a minute. He said he'd drop a line online, but meh, dunno if thats true. It was kinda awkward. We'll see, he's pretty much the same guy as I remember (he's clean shaven again, btw).&nbsp;But then, not ten minutes later, who do I see? Coach Jenkins. Yeah, I was like ""wow"". So, I talked to him for a few minutes, though he had to run quick, and I was half expecting Morgan to pop up somewhere. Haha, yeah. Coincidences, eh?<br /><br />Anyhow, I figure I'll end this with a shout out to Dani, who I hear isn't having the peachiest of times. Yo girl, (or however shout outs start) just remember that there is always another rise and stuff... Okay, not the best at motivating, but really, your a cool chic, so just stay cool.</p>"

"event","Heh, been busy... And stuff... And I might be kinda starting to crush on someone. Who&nbsp;&nbsp;is older than me, of COURSe. Heh, seriously though, I only seem to like the older ones. I blame her hair though. Stupid dark red awesomeness.

So, ANYHOW, here's a brief update on what y'all missed.

Friday: Stare inappropriately and wonder if you're looking at your soul mate.
Success: 90-ish. I stared at a girl so much that I got questioned about it (and almost slapped). Also, I stared for a brief time at this one guy that Shawna and Dani introduced to me. No one noticed, mwahahaha...

Sunday (I decided not to do it on Saturday): No addictive substance day. So, no sugar, caffiene, alcohol, or drugs.
Success: Unfortunately, total success. And I craved cherry soda every second of it.

Monday: Do something before breakfast day. I was suppossed to do something significant before breakfast.
Succuss: 150%, I didn't even EAT breakfast. Ha!

Today (Tuesday): Introduce myself to someone I know but never speak to.
Success: 50%, damnit. I intriduced myself, yeah. To this one guy who comes into my work every morning, reads comics, and then leaves. Never buys a thing. And he's like 50... Anyhow, he fleed when I introduced myself. Seriously, he just like booked it out of there. Wtf?

So yeah, my life (or rather, my calander's demands) lately right up there.

I went clubbing on Friday with Shawna and Dani though, which was cool, even if I don't particularily like rap. Then Saturday, it was just Dani (wel, and Austin, but I haven't really talked about him) cuz Shawna got in a wee bit o trouble. Which is kinda odd, for cancer. So basically, I liked Saturday's music better (techno!), but it sucked that there were less friends.

Sunday, I went over to Josh's. Him, Billy, Karen, and I played some rockband (I totally rock at vocals, oddly enough) for awhile, then I stayed up till 3AM playing Team Fortress 2. Five hours later, I woke up and headed off to work in Billy's dress shirt (hahaha, right?) before hitting their house again on the way home. At 1:30-ish am I headed home via Alex's car and fell asleep like a log, waking up five hours later to go to work (this time in my shirt). Fun sleep deprivation, huh? And guess what? I start work in nine hours.

Night ^^"

"event","<p>So, yesterday was pretty darn cool, in my opinion. I was kinda thrown on inventory for the cafe at random, so I just had to figure out what to do. Now, food inventory was something I had to do at Jack in the Box anyhow, so it wasn't hard. Plus, the cafe manager loved that I knew to rotate the stock. Haha, plus it spent up an hour of my otherwise futile time at work spent trying to find something to do, since the new shipment of books didn't come in yesterday like it was suppossed to.<br /><br />Also, when it was time to go home, a girl named Sarah who works at the cafe was on the same bus as I. Now, I think she's pretty cute (probably thered hair. Dunno why), so it was cool to talk to her for the majority of the bus ride. Dunno, maybe I'll ask her out sometime, though she is a few years older than I (4 years older, to be exact). Oh, and that I don't know if she's already dating.</p>So mission yesterday: Smile inappropriately<br />Success: I didn't really run into an innappropriate situation to smile during, and that makes it 0/0. So, indeterminate."

"event","It totally is. No one understands me. The world is a dark abyss of pain. Like, totally...

Yeah right.

First in my session of self&nbsp;talking to, I'd like to say this: I wish I could come up with as much to write about every post as&nbsp;Shawna did. Wow. Too bad I never manage to be able to write that much. Damn you epic conciseness! Which reminds me, the other&nbsp;day, I heard some ""gangsta"" use that term, epic, to describe pwnage. ""Woah, epic pwnage!"" I think thats hilarious. First off, back in ""the"" day, games were for nerds. Its just funny that I've moved away from video games as&nbsp;the popular trend&nbsp;has moved closer. Whats up with that? Sprite based RPGs are better anyhow...

But ending my tirade of digressing, back to the term ""epic"". Thats from D&amp;D, describing something as epic.&nbsp;I mean, sure, its technical definition can be used in the context of the quote, &nbsp;but D&amp;Ders are pretty much the only people who use it to describe anything that kicks ass, coming from the 20+ levels known as ""epic characters"". And now its starting to move into the mainstream I guess. Do you think the gangsta would have used the term if he knew where it came from?


Hahaha : )

The effects of nerdom on the demographics aside, I've been doing great lately. A bit on the poor side, but I get paid this Friday, and a good amount I think. I've been getting trained on other stuff too, which is always fun, cause I learn more! I saw Bailey, Ashley, and Kevin (well, duh. When can you find Ashley WITHOUT Kevin there?) at work the other day, we talked for a few minutes before they went on. I had work to do too anyhow. But yep.

Mission yesterday: Act like a teenager
Success: 100%, I am one, so anyway I act kinda HAS to fall into that category. Bleh, boring."

"event","<p>So, yesterday was pretty darn eventful, and I am just now getting ready to post about it fo shizzle.<br /><br />So I was given a new assignment yesterday at work, where I basically process and package books we're sending back to the warehouses. It happens monthly, so I guess I am getting started on it. I was able to do my part faster than the four people who were collecting the titles from the shelves were able to do their part. Woot! I was going along smoothly until my finger randomly started bleeding near my fingernail. Not wanting to get blood all over the books, I went to the bathroom to rinse and wash it. There, I managed to get soap in my eye. It shot out from between my hands. Ugh...<br /><br />And during my lunch break, I passed what I thought was lezbians. Cuz they both appeared to be chics (one of them was kinda ugly) sitting on a couch together kissing. I was like ""Huh, don't see that everyday."" On my way back the other way, the ugly one turns out to be a guy. I almost laughed out loud right there. I blame the soap.<br /><br /><br />So anyhow, update on my challenges:<br /><br />Tuesday: Find out how much it would cost to insure a body part. Yeah, totally true.<br />Success: 100% My nose costs a little over 50 bucks a month to insure. Screw that!<br /><br />Wednesday: Go with the Flow, I had to let outside circumstance decide my decisions for me.<br />Success: Piece of cake, I had to deal with that back in high school for a while when I lost my soul (stupid bet). Anyhow, 100% success, and no lost of free will to strangers either.</p>"

THE most? Like, as in more than anything else? Why, I'm not sure I could tell you. Probably, my trip to Europe. I worry a LOT about it. Maybe not so much worry, as fret.


Why?

My idea of going through the world isn't exactly a vacation. I truly do want to challenge myself and discover new facets of myself. At the same time, I don't like doing stuff alone, and I'd really like someone to come. I have friends, yeah, and most seem interested, but I don't plan a vacation. Yeah, sights will be had, and adventures taken, but work will probably be there too, and dirt, dust, and grime will probably be constant. And if I perhaps wanted to strike off on my own for a week or two (a big probabilty)? Then what? I don't wanna just abandon them. So yeah, my plans, aren't exactly the standard for visiting another nation.


What do I plan to do about it?

I guess really the only thing I can - talk to a couple of them. Jon, Shawna, Dani, Matt, my Dad, all of them need to be told exactly what my expectations are so that they know if they really want the same thing as well.


So yep, see, my thoughts as of late have just been planning that trip. So... Uh... Yeah."

Results: 60% success. I forgot at first that it was amnesia day (irony!) and then started the act in the grocery store. Probably more failure than I give it credit for, but meh.

Today: Rage against the Machine Day, I was suppossed to be aggressively angry against all machines.

Success: 100%. I totally was mad at the bus for not being there early, for being to warm, to tall, ect. My anger extended to the radio, who was playing crappy songs. Just to get on my nerves. Stupid thing. I actually had a conversation about how stupid the vending machine near my work was (right in front of it! Take that!), and am even a tad mad at the computer right now, for no reason.

-Sucked me thumb at work. I was by myself at the calander store, and did it the entire time I was helping a customer, except when I was answering her question. Mucho wierd looks and a wrinkled thumb resulted.

-Left my fly unzipped for an hour, and made it obvious to see by tucking in my shirt. Had to zip it up several times when confronted with the fact.

-Played footbag in the calander store in front of a security. Got told to stop as customers came in. I probably shouldn't do this stuff at work...

-Burped constantly on the way home from work (not all that planned, I just had to burp a lot) I got lots of stare and even a couch from the person behind me."

Thats what I did, and it was gnarly awesome, you dig it? Jon, Alex, Dani, and Shawna, plus me, all went and saw Sweeny Todd at the theater, got the place to ourselves because the movie ran through midnight. Then, after Alex ditched us, we went and hung out everywhere until the sun rose, which we watched. Not my idea, I wanted to sleep right up until about 6, when I finished hibernation mode, stopped being sleepy... Just in time for us to all crash at Jon's. The next day, we hung out and played Uno till he had to go to the airport, where we all wished him well (and some other stuff, that isn't for me to tell).

Anyhow, this is the next year now, and there are a few changes that everyone likes to make round this time. I'm finally gonna try to make a resolution, or rather a few. I hereby promise to a) get in shape, a fat world traveler is a short lived one. There's a gym right by my work that I'm gonna start going to. I even get a discount for working at the mall. b) Save up money for school, it coming up, and I don't want to owe anything as I go through it. Might mean a lean time ahead, but it'll be great practice for my travels. c) By some new clothes. Contrary to b perhaps, but I really need some new pants and a couple more dress shirts.

"event","Hello all you happy people.

Okay, first agenda today in this here journal: I agree with me buddy Dani, Christmas isn't&nbsp;all that appealing this year. I just cannot get into it, I think I might be done with it all. Buying stuff for people just seems to materialistic for me, and the idea that there is a specific time of the year to be nice to people is just stupid. Be nice all year round. I'm still buying presents for my family, because they celebrate it, but I told them I don't want any. I am a conscientious objecter to the lack of&nbsp;morals this holiday is appearing to contain.

&nbsp;Second: Jon is in town, which is awesome. He's one of those guys, y'know? I can talk about pretty much anything with him, and vice versa. Might not see him all that much though. I definately think he should stop by my work someday after christmas around noonish.

To all those other friends... I can't promise a single paragraph per person, sorry.

Headed up to Josh's house last Friday and hung around for the night. A new tabletop RPG I'm borrowing from work was brought and intriduced. Better than D&amp;D in my opinion, no classes. Weheaded over for Nick's party the next day and hung with a bunch of people there for the night. Bailey, Ashley, Kevin, I think that was everyone I knew, plus Nick, Josh, and myself. Another fun day. Then, Sunday night I spent over at Josh's again, worked on Monday, spent the Night at Matt's house Monday, and came home Tuesday evening. My mom had no idea where I'd been. I told her a walk about, before promptly getting yelled at. Twas fun though, just gotta be careful not to wear out my welcome anywhere.

This week was really busy at work, what with customer freaking about christmas. Got some extra hours in to counteract the holiday's missing one. Still fun, and I'm learning how to do everything now.


I saw an entirely normal question in a survey today, and just couldn't answer it. It was ""Do you want someone back?"" I was going to put yes, but then had to stop. Cause really, if said someone that I want back, doesn't want to be back, than me wishing otherwise would be wishing them to change. And then, its a different person, which would have been horrible for me to wish upon someone. The only person that should make someone change is that someone. So, I was going to put no, but then had to stop. Not only do I know someone's view on this, so didn't know if this would be wishing contrary to something they wanted, but I also really would have enjoyed them back myself, and how selfish that is is a matter of looking back at this argument and looping it nigh infinitely. Anyhow, in the end, I overthought it a came to the conclusion that my answer is ""what someone wants, I want as well."" And that is what happens when I overthink a question.

Moral of the story? Find it yourself."

Thats a lot more accurate, I'd have to say. I feel entirely different about, well, everything.</p><p>For those of you who don't know, which is those who aren't me, I've been reading this book&nbsp;called 2012: The Return of Quitzicotl. It a book on metaphysical studies, and talks of how the human race will be going through a rapid phsycic evoltution in the near future. Well, its suppossed to. Really, its just been kinda talking about a bunch of fringe-science topics like crop circles, shamanism, quantum physics, ect. And, even though I don't exactly&nbsp;regard&nbsp;his words&nbsp;the highest, the book is&nbsp;something I can hardly put down, whenever it happens to be quiet.&nbsp;Just the ideas that&nbsp;the author puts forth, are enough to get my mind moving, even if I reject his view on it. Do I think you should read it? Only if you want to. The big thing is to just find an idea, any idea, that is vastly different from your own, and think about it. It will open horizons.<br /><br />My job is still running well, though it hardly looks like I've done anything there. I mean, everytime I get merchandise on the floor, we get more books in. Woot. But, I still love it, and only wish I had more hours.<br /><br />Friends: Haven't hung with anyone cept Matt, and I spent most of that time playing Chrono Trigger. Such an awesome RPG, if you like video games, that should be one you try.<br /><br />Love Life: Nothing new, still am not interested in a soul, though I think I'm finally settled into my life outside of Krystal's. I can't say I don't love her, honestly, and I will probably always do anything for her, but I'm happy for now, I don't really need intimacy.<br /><br />Everything Else: I'm bummed I missed the drill meet, heard Everett did pretty decent. Can't wait to see my friends again, Jon, Dani, Shawna, Josh, and all the rest, hope to see y'all this coming month.<br /><br />Annd, I'm out. Night!</p>"

And thats why I should never ever keep a journal that others can read ^^<br /><br />The last few days have been fun. Hung out with Josh (well, a little, he left, and D&amp;D beckoned then). We have, I believed, obtained the next level of enlightenment. And that is, yellow team sucks. Fuckin yellow team... ALSO, I hung out with Dani at the mall the other day, ran into a couple people I knew, saw Hitman with her, twas fun. Though it kinda felt wierd to me, going to see a movie with just one girl, as friends. But really, it shouldn't I suppose.<br /><br />I am still loving my job, I smile the whole day through. I'm making huge leaps of progress on the mountain-o-boxes-o-doom, as I like to refer to the unpacked bargain books. Ugh, I almost caused an avalanche the other day. And, everytime I get progress that is noticeable, the next day I come back to find it ruined by another shipment. Tis a tad annoying, but I laugh it off.&nbsp;<br /><br />Most every one of my co-workers is a girl. I doubt I've said more than a few sentances to my male peers, the I've mostly worked with the male management. But yeah, I lot of girls work there. Some of them are pretty cute, and all of them are nice. One talks in a way that reminds me of Krystal, a lot. I dunno, but I haven't an eye for any of them, so I guess I'll continue waiting.<br /><br />Morgan, by the way, sent me quite the interesting quote the other day. It reads:&nbsp;<br /><br />""Woman can make the best and stongest of men weak. They make you second guess yourself. The best women makes you think how you can better yourself, the worst what your flaws are. One word is all it takes to make an otherwise confident man crumble. Its the one thing all men fear: loss ofm ourselves, without our choosing"" spoken by an old man. So, I suppose if you want something to think about for this post, think about that quote. I believe in it one hundred percent, I have dealt with everything contained in it. </p>"

So, I'll let them out here.&nbsp;Almost every penny I make ends up been given to her, so that my family&nbsp;doesn't go under. I'm scared I'll never make it to college, I'm scared that, rather living my life, I'm going to be a sacrifice&nbsp;so that my sister might have a chance. I hate this so much.

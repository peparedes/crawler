"event","Sunday I had completly forgotten to time travel, but my clocks all changed automatically, so I appreciated the extra hour of sleep without even thinking about it. I just lazed about all day and eventually got around to doing laundry.

<i>The Amazing Race</i> was alright, I felt more manipulated by production than I ussually do. Hopefully it pans out as a good season, with a mostly recruited L.A. cast I have my doubts.

Afterwards I watched <lj-cut text=""Bambi""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034492/"">Bambi</a>. Taken as a arrative film it's quite weak, but when I was watching the story meetings bonus feature, Walt really described it perfectly, it's a symphony of the forest. Viewing it that way it's an okay movie, and the introduction to some amazing animation effects. ***</lj-cut>.

Today I went to this editor's house in Brentwood to help transcribe for his documentary. It was the first time I'd ever met him and he left me alone in his house all day, which seems a bit odd, but I'm a trustworthy guy and I was ""hired"" on a recommendation. It's only 7:15 but I have go to bed soon since I have a 5:30 a.m. call for <i>Monk</i> tomorrow."

It was pretty much what I expected. Good 'ole substance free family comedies. The animal stuff was kind of cool, but looked digitally composited. It's cool that they actually built the ark full size. I guess Steve Carrell has to do a few big movies to keep his schedule open for small independent films. **</lj-cut>.

Friday I started the job that I never should have taken. The chair was broken, the computer was old and slow, the footage sucked, and I was just getting an instinctual ""get out of here/don't be here"" vibe. I talked to the boss about it, she found someone else, so I'm free and unemployed again.

Saturday Brian called me and we went to a $5 matinee of <lj-cut text=""American Gangster""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765429/"" target=""_new"">American Gangster</A>. For a 157 minute film it kept my interest and that's a definite plus. Other than that it wasn't was pretty standard and straight forward. I'm so glad they caught him. I loved the end when Frank walks out of church and Richie is just standing there, and you know. But again it was all very standard and straight forward. ***</lj-cut>.

After getting home I dawdled about and eventually watched <lj-cut text=""Meet the Robinsons""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396555/"" target=""_new"">Meet the Robinsons</A>. So disappointing. I guess it's one of those thrown together for a quick buck disney movies. It has cool visuals though. And I can appreciate it in terms of being a this tribute to Walk Disney. The visuals are clearly inspired by the architecture of the Disney Studio. I appreciate that. ***</lj-cut>.

Afterwards I had yet another long drawn out confusing online conversation with Sarah that went way too late into the morning. I slept way in, and now I need to go do laundry."

It's not really a Western, but because of the setting it really feels like one, it's odd that there are still these little holes the West even in 1945. Such a frightening movie as things begin to unfold and you really start to feel how trapped he is in the little town. But of course Spencer Tracy is a one armed action hero who can get out of anything! Ultimately though it's wits that win. I really liked it. ****</lj-cut>.

I got up early to go in and do my paperwork and whatnot at 3 Ball, but when I got there the person who hired me wasn't there yet, and I had to leave shortly afterward anyway. So I took off and got stuck on the 405. Traffic was so slow that it was almost impossible to change lanes to try to get off. I was about a half hour late to set. Other than not having time to eat, it didn't hurt me it all. We were shooting <i>The L-Word</i> up at Yamashiro in the Hollywood Hills. I really want to take my family to dinner there when they visit. I was expecting a long day, but got wrapped early. It worked out well though since I got a text to come hang out with some friends at a bar.

Yesterday I went back for more of the same and was there until 2 a.m. I got up at 7:30 to go to my new job, but just couldn't, besides being tired I was feeling pukey, luckily I didn't actually puke.

So tomorrow I'm actually going to start this job that I'm really not looking forward to.

This whole week has just been very gray. Once I'm up and running with this new job I shouldn't be as reluctant about it. It'll actually be good to have regular work again.

To top that the after math and consequences of the wonderful time I had last thursday night has left me feeling pretty lonely. Hopefully things will turn around soon."

"event","So Thursday night things went more or less as planned. First we played Upwords while I made dinner, then ate and watched <lj-cut text=""The Graduate""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/"" target=""_new"">The Graduate</A>. She thought Benjamin Braddock was annoying and disliked the ending because she was already married. I guess that kind of defines the differences in the ways we see the world. She also didn't like how they repeated the same songs. She claims to have liked it okay though.</lj-cut>. We slept in separate beds and in the morning she hurried out. There's probably some stuff I should write about in my paper journal.

I went off to work on <i>Pushing Daises</i>. It was only 2nd unit of a car explosion and a Pacer on fire upside down on a big turn table. Luckily it was a short day so I was able to go meet my French relatives at their hotel when they arrived on their free trip to L.A. to see the Eagles. Julie was tired and went to bed, but Denis and I drove around a bit and went to Canter's he was so pleased by the place that he asked if we could come back with Julie.

On Saturday I went to USC for a Cinema school career seminar thing, and spoke with one of the panelists whose student film I had helped out on. He remembered my name and I gave him my card. There is a good chance he might call me to be a camera intern at some point. Then I got a bit lost trying to find the new location for my book group. We had so many people at the book group that split the group, and I ended up on the other end of the table from the new girl I'd been looking forward to seeing again. I still feel like I'm new even though I've been going for two years.

In the evening eD came over and we watched <lj-cut text=""Powaqqatsi""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095895/"" target=""_new"">Powaqqatsi</A>. We both agree that <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103767/"" target=""_new"">Baraka</A> is better. **</lj-cut>.

Sunday I picked up Denis and Julie, we walked down Hollywood Blvd, drove down Sunset, walked down Rodeo Dr. walked through 3rd St. Promenade, and down to Venice. Then we went to the Glendale Galleria cause they (Julie) wanted to do some more American shopping. Quite the whirlwind L.A. tour, but when you're only in town for a weekend, not too bad.

This morning I had an interview for a transcribing job. They offered and I reluctantly took it. The pay is lower than I've gotten in the past and it's a bit far away in Manhattan Beach, but I'm really in no position to pass up work. To make matters worse though a certain someone is thinking I'm an idiot for taking jobs that don't seem to take me anywhere. There is only so much reminding her and myself that every new job is meeting new people who might hire me in the future. she's got me thinking that I might just have to set a definite out point and back up career plans in case this whole working in the industry thing doesn't work out.

So anyway I'm feeling a bit lonely.

Tomorrow I have to go to Manhattan Beach to do start paperwork and stuff. They want me to start tomorrow, but I already have a 2 day background gig. So I'm probably gonna have to do some weekend make-up days, but that'll mean extra money for me to get caught back up."

"event","So Sunday night I watched <lj-cut text=""The Hoax""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462338/"" target=""_new"">The Hoax</A>, which is about the author who claimed to have the official rights to Howard Hughes' autobiography. It's really just this huge web of lies, and they cut back to previous scenes to show us that it's a lie, which is devicey and I really don't know if it works. The story is interesting, especially how it relates to Nixon's breaking into the Watergate hotel. This nothing loser basically caused the whole Nixon debacle. It might be an interesting book, but as a movie it's a bit odd. **</lj-cut>.

Monday morning I had an early call on <i>CSI</i> that turned into a car call, where I practically doing stunt drive. If I had screwed up my cues, I totally could have been barreled into by a trash truck. I didn't get a stunt driving bump though.

That night I watched <lj-cut text=""Haxan""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013257/"" target=""_new"">Haxan</A>. It's this weird creepy ""documentary"" about the history of witches and the whole burning them thing. It toys with being a documentary, but has these over the top special effects make-up sequences with demons and whatnot. It's just weird and interesting. I love that people could still experiment in those ways with cinema back in the silent era. ***</lj-cut>.

On tuesday I was at Warner Brothers for <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> for their live tape day. The highlight of my day was walking back to lunch, I had one of those only in Hollywood moments. Right as I was passing The guys who play Sheldon on <i>Big Bang Theory</i> talking with Ned from <i>Pushing Daises</i> Paul Reubens rode by on a three wheeled bicycle in a ridiculous costume. Then as I walked further the girl who plays Chuck, was sitting on the steps of her trailer  talking on her cell phone and she smiled back at me and I totally melted.

Yesterday I got a rush call for <i>Life</i> which is so incredibly awkward because it's a show that has it's regulars and I really felt like I was invading their space. It was a nice long day though and should be a good check.

I took today off because someone is visiting me tonight.

I was supposed to be on <i>Greek</i> tomorrow. I just got called though because I was canceled, but I was able to book myself within five minutes on <i>Pushing Daises</i>."

So tuesday was <i>October Road</i> which was completely uneventful and yet another $60 day.

Wednesday I wasn't working so went way down Crenshaw <i>Transformers</i> from a Redbox machine and to get a movie that I could only find a library down there.

When I got home I watched the documentary <lj-cut text=""Tying the Knot""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410818/"" target=""_new"">Tying the Knot</A>. It's a documentary for/about gay marriage. Already feeling that the anti-gay marriage crowd is ridiculous the documentary just reinforces things I already believe. For people on the edge though I think it provides good examples of people's lives literally being ruined because the government refuses to recognize their marriages. It's sad really that people can't see how much their bigotry hurts these people. ***</lj-cut>.

Thursday I worked on <i>Las Vegas</i>. I was all excited for a nice long day, but the last scene before lunch involved a smoke bomb. Luckily I was one of the first ones out, but the people who came tearing out after me had tears just streaming down their faces. After lunch they made the decision that the stage was unsafe to be working in and we all got sent home. So it was just a minimum day and to top things off I got a ticket for an illegal u-turn as I was pulling into the parking lot.

Off the availability line I got called for <i>Shark</i> to be a tennis ball boy. That's certainly not something I'd call in for. It involved running which of course I'm not a fan of. It did feel good to actually be moving a bit though. I feel like I ought to do a bit more of it.

Today I went to try to find a cheap suit at a couple of Goodwill's and the huge St. Vincent De Paul. I also got fed up with the stupid fliers on my car from the same damn insurance company who is nothing but rude to me when I call them up to complain. So I went into a police station. And explained the situation. It seems that car flyering is a citable crime, but not a reportable one so unless they are caught in the act there isn't much that can be done about it, but the officer offered to call the company and sound official and try to scare them a bit. It's nice to have positive police interaction on occasion to counteract the negativity toward them that comes with getting tickets and the like.

When I got home I wanted to use more of my Netflix instant viewing before my account ran out so I watched <lj-cut text=""The Hunger""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085701/"" target=""_new"">The Hunger</A>. It was something that Chuck Palahniuk had recommended it to me. Man he likes weird movies. The movie is ridiculously 80s and extremely weird in what I can only assume since I've never seen it a <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936/"" target=""_new"">Twin Peaks</A> kind of way even though it was made quite a few years later. It's a bit surprising to see Susan Sarandon so, um, naked, and writhing, but I guess every actress has done it at some point. Sorry, Chuck, I was excited and wanted to see it, but I just couldn't get into it. I guess it was the ending you liked and I did think the ending was interesting. **</lj-cut>.

Then I watched <lj-cut text=""Dark Days""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235327/"" target=""_new"">Dark Days</A>, a documentary about the people ""homeless"" people living in the abandoned tunnels under New York City. It's shot in a high contrast black and white in a sort of Maysles brothers style. When Amtrak kicks them out at the end  and they all get apartments it's just very nice and smile worthy. ***</lj-cut>.

Tomorrow I have no idea what I'm doing. Monday I'm working <i>CSI</i>."

Afterwards Brian and I went to a screening of <lj-cut text=""Lars and the Real Girl""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805564/"" target=""_new"">Lars and the Real Girl</A>. I knew what to expect and still found the whole thing a bit odd. I find especially odd that Ryan Gosling would do this movie, but I give him major props for taking more off beat non-mainstream roles. It makes me wish though that some cute shy girl was secretly in love with me despite incredibly odd quirks. ***</lj-cut>. Afterwards we went to a bar to meet up with some of Brian's friends, and particularly the girl whose house I ended up last week. At some point he back to his seat and out of nowhere let me know that she wasn't interested in me. I later found out it came from her ex-boyfriend/freind and not from her directly, but it still felt like a major rejection and left me a bit depressed in the morning.

Friday I had no work and was feeling like a lump. I booked work early and was feeling better, despite a call later that I was cancelled. I hung out at Brian's and we played Scattergories without the game using lists we found online.

Saturday we went to the matinee at the Vista of <lj-cut text=""Michael Clayton""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465538/"" target=""_new"">Michael Clayton</A>. I didn't really care to see it but I've seen every movie at the Vista on opening weekend for the past 4 films. As for the movie it's very well constructed and put together. It certainly keeps you on the edge and thinking, but it's just not my kind of movie. I did like how they play with this idea of is he good or is he bad. I still think the title is dumb though. I mean it fits because it's certainly what the movie is centrally about, but it makes you ask the question, Who is Michael Clayton? It could be called ""The Fixer"" or something but I would agree that that title would allude to a different feeling of a movie. ***</lj-cut>.

Afterward we wandered around for hours and noticed a poster for this play that he'd seen years ago and was an interesting concept so we ended up buying tickets and going since it was the last night of it. It's this conceptual musical called <i>The Last Five Years</i> where the man's story travels forward through time, and the woman's story travels backward through their relationship. Brian thought it was a terrible performance, I thought it was okay. It could have been done a lot better though.

Afterwards we went to Blockbuster to rent ""The Bigs"" cause Brian wanted to try it out. All the batting and pitching has left my arm incredibly sore.

He ended up staying the night and then in the afternoon we walked all the way to downtown and I gave a tour of the things I know about including dinner at Clifton's cafeteria.

After he went home I watched <lj-cut text=""Hannah and Her Sisters""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091167/"" target=""_new"">Hannah and her Sisters</A>. It's from the period when Woody Allen movies were still really good. I liked the inter-titles and voice over, and I really liked the little musical montages. It's just a nice movies. ***</lj-cut>.

Today I didn't have work today and mostly laid about. I had to go to USC to return a book and I was going to stay for that class, but they were having their midterm. So I came home and watched <lj-cut text=""I'm Reed Fish""><A HREF=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0464061/"" target=""_new"">I'm Reed Fish</A>. Netflix recommended it to me and I liked it okay. It's just this little small town love story, until the film strip breaks and you realize what's really going on. The film within a film thing really is it's saving grace and then you realize. And then it turns out that it's written by none other than Reed Fish. It's cute. ***</lj-cut>.

At midnight I went to Vons to get <A HREF=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0418279/"" target=""_new"">Transformers</A>, but the machine didn't roll over to new releases like I thought I it was supposed to.

So I just finished watching <lj-cut text=""The Insider""><A HREF=""www.imdb.com/title/tt0140352/"" target=""_new"">The Insider</A>. I was really just sort of blown away. I guess the whole emotional charge of the little guy standing up for what's right and good. I did find it a bit odd though that the lack of cell phones in common use at that period in time really seems to play a heck of a lot. I guess that's how things were. It definitely makes sense now that Russel Crowe got his Oscar a year late and for the wrong movie, cause you really can't claim the academy giving it to Kevin Spacey that year. It's really nice to be reminded why I don't buy Phillip Morris food products. ****</lj-cut>.

So now back to other things. The Strip Bar day on <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460690/"" target=""_new"">The Unit</A> was somewhat awkward and uneventful. Afterward Brian came back to my apartment and he watched his favorite movie, <lj-cut text=""Rio Bravo""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053221/"" target=""_new"">Rio Bravo</A>. It was alright. It's hard to say that though when someone else is raving about it. I did really like the Stumpy character. He was certainly a nice bit of comic relief. I also found it hilarious that it has a musical number of sorts. The built up to ending worked pretty well too, but I think it could have gotten there more quickly. ***</lj-cut>.

I hadn't booked work for today so I got the rush call for <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068120"" target=""_new"">The Price is Right</A> audience. Drew Carey is terrible for the show, but he's great just chatting with the audience during the breaks. I love that he laughs at his own jokes it's hilarious.

Then I came home and watched a movie, but I already mentioned that. Tomorrow I'm being paid to get my hair cut for an eventual work day on an upcoming Clint Eastwood Movie. I specifically tried to book something that I knew would be short so I could go to a screening of <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805564/"" target=""_new"">Lars and the Real Girl</A>.

I can't imagine that it's financially beneficial. The rent for the building must be huge, but it is cool that they escalators in  the middle of their set, and that police station can move seamlessly from interior to exterior. I was hired as a cop, but they had too many and I changed over to a suspect and got to walk through the police station handcuffed.

On Saturday Brian and I went to the Los Feliz 3 to see <lj-cut text=""Eastern Promises""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765443/"" target=""_new"">Eastern Promises</A>. It's quite the interesting film. I had suspicions of the big twist about half way though, but I can't really say that I had figured out that working as an informant or whatnot. But who is he really working for? It's quite creepy really. Brian had a problem with the graphicness of the two throat slittings, but had no problem with the nude fight at the bathhouse. I thought it went a bit too long though, the battle scene not the movie. ***</lj-cut>.

Afterwards he was going to go to the bar to watch the cubs game, and I came along. We stayed for the see the Diamondbacks sweep the cubs, and then the Rockies sweeping the Phillies. I of course don't care about sports, but it's nice to be out of the house. Also a very cute friend of his came out as well and I ended up spending the night at her apartment. It was an set of circumstances and didn't exactly amount to anything, but I may be seeing her again on thursday depending on my work situation.

Sunday not much happened. I had to get up extrememly early this morning for a 6 a.m. but my neighbors music was loud so I woke up around 1 a.m. as I was feeling wide awake so I decided trying to sleep would just make getting out bed at 4 a.m. even harder so I watched television (on DVD) until 4 a.m. when I got up and went to CBS Radford for <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0976014/"" target=""_new"">Greek</A>.

We ended up going to the $3 theater to see <lj-cut text=""The King of Kong""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0923752/"" target=""_new"">The King of Kong</A>. I always like seeing documentaries in the theater. What a great group of characters. I love that there is this whole conflict between taped scores and live scores. The thing that really struck me was how I could do a documentary like this. The only real expense is air travel and accommodation for the small crew. I'm thinking a unicycle documentary could be made in a similar fashion.They really lucked out though that Billy Mitchell turned out to be such a jerk. Also the grease pencil/training/drumming montage was incredible. ****</lj-cut>. Afterward we had pizza and beer at the place across the street from Canter's.

I'd seen it before, but I was so out of it before, too young and not into that type of movie. The musical numbers are really great. The inter-cutting of fantasy and reality is really cool. The Air Rotica number is sexy, but the whole film seems so dated which makes it a bit odd. ***</lj-cut>.

Right after I watched <lj-cut text=""Maxed Out""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762117/"" target=""_new"">Maxed Out: Hard Times, Easy Credit and the Era of Predatory Lenders</A>. I'm glad to be able to not use up my Netflix queue on a movie like this. I just wish the watch instantly movies looked better. Anyway I certainly didn't learn anything new about how predatory and terrible the credit industry is and how much our government panders to them. I get tired of these sorts of documentaries but it's good to get this sort of info out there. ***</lj-cut>.

Now I'm going to bed even though I don't have to work until 2 tomorrow. If I get done early enough I might try to go to that class at USC I've been crashing."

"event","So tuesday I wasn't working and just hung out around the apartment. I watched <lj-cut text=""Knocked Up""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478311/"" target=""_new"">Knocked Up</A>. Katherine Heigl sure was beuatiful and Seth Rogen's character is such a slob. Of course it's a movie and of course he has to redeem himself, but it's such a typical movie plot. Sort of in the way I dislike <A HREF=""www.imdb.com/title/tt0142342/"" target=""_new"">Big Daddy</A>, but of course this is a much better movie. Overall it's pretty, eh. ***</lj-cut>.

Wednesday was a tux call for a fancy wedding on <A HREF=""www.imdb.com/title/tt0805669/"" target=""_new"">Ugly Betty</A>. It was at the First Congregational Church which isn't too far from my apartment so I was able to walk. I got released at 8:30, but it turns out some people were there until 3 a.m. I wish I had stayed that would have been a nice check. The advantage though was that I got home with enough time to watch <lj-cut text=""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109045/"" target=""_new"">The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</A>. What a weird little film. It's certainly interesting to see Guy Pearce in a frock. There's definitely something about it that just draws you in and makes it work. As shallow and vein as they are it's just charming. ***</lj-cut>.

Thursday morning my call got pushed until 12:30 so in the morning I watched <lj-cut text=""The Lake House""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410297/"" target=""_new"">The Lake House</A>. The concept far outdoes the actual film. I just wish they'd cleaned up their time travel loops and everything especially the ending. He should have died, you can't change the past. That's not how movies work though. Just like I hated how they'd have conversations in voiceover that was supposed to be their letters. I honestly just didn't believe they were in love. Now I want to see the Korean original just to see if they ended it the way it should have ended. **</lj-cut>.

Then I went to fake Republican fundraiser at Sony for <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0981216/"" target=""_new"">Cavemen</A>. We were there until 3 a.m.

Yesterday my call wasn't until 5 p.m. at CBS Radford for this new show <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898332/"" target=""_new"">Samantha Who?</A>. When I first heard the name I thought it was a show about an Asian teen detective. But it's not, it's a show that has a Shark Jump as it's premise. But anyway since it was a later call I had time for a movie before going in. I watched <lj-cut text=""Stranger Than Paradise""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088184/"" target=""_new"">Stranger Than Paradise</A>. It seems that it's Jim Jarmusch's first feature and it's a great start. Nothing happens but it keeps your interest and that's hard. It probably helps that Eva is adorable. Jarmusch is kind of hit or miss, but this one is a hit. ***</lj-cut>.

So anyway it's been fun to be doing background work again. The only problem I'm having is all the cute girls I've met and talked to seem to have boyfriends, but it does give me hope.

Now it's the weekend and I have to come up with things to do. Monday I'm on <A HREF=""www.imdb.com/title/tt0758737/"" target=""_new"">Brothers and Sisters</A>."

I think it was last saturday that I re-joined Netflix to try their watch instantly. Unfortunately my internet connection is only good enough for the basic quality that looks like the movies you download illegally. I used it to watch <lj-cut text=""The People Vs. Larry Flynt""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117318/"" target=""_new"">The People Vs. Larry Flynt</A>. I had it on my list because it's directed by Milos Foreman and has Ed Norton in it. What a prick that guy is. The movie just didn't do it for me. ***</lj-cut>.

Sunday I went to the Vista to see <lj-cut text=""Across the Universe""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445922/"" target=""_new"">Across the Universe</A>. The concept is brilliant, the execution was week. There was barely a story, and most of the songs were barely integrated into the story at all. Some of the musical numbers I thought were pretty good though. I loved the bowling number, because it was out there, but it wasn't impossible. I also like both of the military precision numbers, but they didn't really do justice to the songs. Evan Rachel Wood was really beautiful in it, especially the underwater love scene, just a beautiful image. I guess that's Julie Taymor for you. She makes really beautiful films, but beatiful alone doesn't make a movie good. It's sad because now that Beatles Musical concept has more or less been done and the concept has the potential to be a much better film. ***</lj-cut>.

In the evening I watched <lj-cut text=""The Verdict""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084855/"" target=""_new"">The Verdict</A>. I love how it's the story of this lame lawyer, but ultimately decides that he has to do what's right instead of just taking the offer and of course it looks like he's going to fail, especially when his key witness is dismissed, but then the jury comes back and Wow!***.</lj-cut>. 

Monday was my last day on the show that I still can't talk about.

And once again I'm running out of time to update since I want to watch a movie before I go to work tonight."

I swapped Saturday for Sunday at work for two exciting events. First was my book group. I was quite surprised to find some attactive young new members, I hope they stick it out and come again.

On the way home I went grocery shopping and had a man get mad at me in line for taking to long when I was trying to make sure I was taking full advantage of Vons' buy 20 get $20 off promotion.

Then I headed to Pico Rivera, Fullerton and then Newport beach to see Devo at the taste of Newport. The Run Hit Wonder show was still their best (that I've been to).

I had planned to get the whole thing assembled, but around 10 I was just dead tired so I went to bed with it all built except the drawers and door, and back panel. I'm going to finish that up tonight. I was going to move my computer over today too, but I've already ordered my new one so now I'm just going to wait even though it's a bit odd because the couch is taking up half the room. But until I am able to get rid of my old desk it'll take up half the room as well.

So yesterday after work I met up with a co-worker at the El Capitan theater to see <lj-cut text=""The Jungle Book""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061852/"" target=""_new"">The Jungle Book</a>. They are playing it there because there is a 40th anniversary DVD release coming soon. It was digital projection and the image was so clear you could see the texture of the paper in the watercolor backgrounds. You could almost see the erased lines in the cell drawings. As far as the movie is concerned it's decent Disney fare. It's a bit episodic and lacks real plot, but the music is pretty keen. It's also the last film personally supervised by Walt. I think my favorite parts are the fab four vultures and when Kaa gets sprung and crawls crooked. ***</lj-cut>.

Tonight I get to stop on the way home to try to return the fan I bought a few weeks ago that already stopped working then I get to finish assembling my desk. Plus we get to see if Dick and Danielle pull it through to final 2 on <i>Big Brother</i>."

"event","So last night after work I went to USC again for that TV class. This week it was <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397442/"" target=""_new"">Gossip Girl</a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0934814/"" target=""_new"">Chuck</a>, which both happen to be made by the same guy, Josh Scwartz who also created <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362359/"" target=""_new"">The O.C.</a> and seems to revel in the actual sorts of television that he produces. <i>Gossip Girl</i> obviously isn't a show created for me, and I'm sort of undecided about whether or not I'll be watching <i>Chuck</i>. Some of the misuse of technology in it really bothered me.

The bigger drama was this morning and trying to get my desk delivered. I specifically requested that it be delivered in the morning so I could stay home from work and then just go in as soon as it arrived. I called around 10 to ask about it and they wouldn't give me any answers only that morning = until noon. So I waited until noon and of course it hadn't arrived. I had to call and complain and whatnot about my missing half a day of work for something that didn't even arrive. I suggested they give me half a day's pay in gift cards, but after talking to supervisors or whatever the best they could do for me is a $20 gift card. I left a note on my door saying to leave in the back. So hopefully it is there and I don't have to deal with any more hassle than getting it into the house by myself.

Since I came in late I'm still at work. Technically I need to make up the 4 and 1/2 hours I missed but I'll probably head home shortly."

"event","So Saturday after worked I watched <lj-cut text=""Showtime""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284490/"" target=""_new"">Showtime</a>. In being a parody of a buddy cop movie, it's very much a typical buddy cop movie. So it's a genre bending, genre film. It's cute though. It's an interesting take on reality TV as well, but I hate when they do impossible TV stuff, like supposedly having cameras in places they really couldn't. It's cute though. The best part I think is actually Robert Deniro in the confessional doing buddy cop movie impressions. **</lj-cut>.

Sunday the plan was to go to St. Vincent De Paul after the movie to look for a desk, but it turns out they close at 4 so I didn't have time, but going to a movie is enough of a getting out of the house the day. I met up with a guy from work at the Vista to see <lj-cut text=""3:10 to Yuma""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381849/"" target=""_new"">3:10 to Yuma</a>. It is what it is. I hate to say that because it gives a sense that the western is an inferior genre, which it isn't other than the fact that I don't particularly care for them. The movie was alright though. I liked that he turned himself in at the end. I fell asleep a bit and missed the part with Luke Wilson and the monkey. ***</lj-cut>.

Then I watched <lj-cut text=""Dave Chappelle's Block Party""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425598/"" target=""_new"">Dave Chappelle's Block Party</a>. I don't particularly care for Dave Chappelle or any of the musical acts at the block party, but Michel Gondry directed it so I wanted to give it a shot. It's not particularly of his style or anything, but it's an entertaining enough film. I mean, in any sort of performance art the one's who rise to the top do so for a reason. So no matter what their artistic discipline they've made it because of Charisma and personality and that really is what shows through and makes the film. The things I really liked was all the stuff where he was inviting random people in Ohio to come to New York for his party. **</lj-cut>.

Oh the other funny thing that happened is when I called to activate my new credit card the woman was like, ""Whoa, you live in Los Angeles, do you see famous people all the time."" So I told her about working in TV and whatnot and making my life sound to someone like that to be the most amazing thing ever. I do sort of prefer when the cards are just activated by a computer.

I don't have anything happening tonight so I might just end up watching <i>Cops</i> and a movie."

I must say the end of the Christmas Special is possibly the greatest moment in television history. I knew it was coming but it still brings tears to my eyes.

Tomorrow is already friday. They're buying us lunch tomorrow at work. Being friday I feel like I ought to go out or whatever. Quazar and the Bamboozled are playing at some bar somewhere, but they don't go on until 11:45 and I think that's a bit too late for me to stay out on a work night."

"event","So the word of the weekend was HOT. Too darn hot really. Monday I finally realized, because I had company coming over, that I should buy another fan. I had to go to 6 stores before I found any. I'm thinking about buying another since the one I got is so much quieter than the big box fan I already had. It was so hot though that my company decided she was over driving up, and instead was going to sit on her butt and do nothing.

So Saturday after work I watched my new favorite documentary TV series (<i>Cops</i>) while I made dinner and then watched the KCET Saturday night movie, <lj-cut text=""What's Up Doc?""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069495/"" target=""_new"">What's Up Doc?</a>. For some reason I'd always thought it was a Woody Allen movie. I think I had it confused with <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061177/"" target=""_new"">What's Up, Tiger Lily?</a>. I really enjoyed it. It's sort of a mad cap comedy like <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057193/"" target=""_new"">It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World</a> but with some class and sophistication I guess you'd call it. I don't know. It's ridiculousness just worked for me and Barbara Streisand really was adorable when she was younger, what happened? Martin Sheen was calling it a screwball comedy and I guess that's why it works, there was a little bit of Hepburn and Grant in there. ****</lj-cut>.

Sunday I laid in bed and read most of the day, eventually I went to target to look for desks of which they had none, but now I'm thinking I need to buy a proper TV stand even though the milk crates work fine. Eventually eD came over and we watched <lj-cut text=""The Host""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468492/"" target=""_new"">The Host</a>. I saved it to watch with eD because of it's Koreaness, he's obsessed with that sort of thing. It's an alright monster movie. It has some interesting sub-plot stuff. I also thought the fish tails coming out of the monsters back were pretty interesting. Overall it was a really well designed monster. The whole movie was pretty good. I also like that they let the girl die. Ed pointed out that they;d never do that in a Hollywood movie. Afterward on the DVD there was a special feature of the director apologizing to everyone he cut out of the movie and all the people who were inconvenienced by the production. What American director would ever do that? ***</lj-cut>.

As I already mentioned, yesterday, Labor Day, the plan was for a good friend I don't see as often as I like to to drive up from Orange County to hang out. But with the heat and everything she just couldn't muster the energy to get off her butt. To be honest though the heat left me lying about for most of the day too so I really can't blame her. I just hope we get to hang out soon.

In the evening I watched <lj-cut text=""Tideland""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410764/"" target=""_new"">Tideland</a>. It's directed by Terry Gilliam so I expected it to be pretty weird, but this one really bordered on fucked up. At the beginning of the film when she's preparing her dad's heroin for him, it's like, ""Hmm, this could be interesting."" But then it just gets weirder. And there doesn't seem to be a sane character in the whole movie. Just odd and disturbing. There was an intro before the film from Terry Gilliam saying that some people won't like, and others will love it. I know I didn't love it, but I'm not sure whether or not I hate it. **</lj-cut>.

Last night I cleaned my bathroom, washed dishes, and watched <lj-cut text=""Gigot""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056017/"" target=""_new"">Gigot</a>. Quite the disappointing film. I guess that's why it's not available on video and I had to get a bootleg copy of it.

On the little making of short film it looks like they had about a half mile of dolly track laid out to move the jib across the desert. That in and of itself is pretty amazing. The track was so long they even had a mobile video village to be pushed along behind the camera. The whole thing is a pretty cool endeavor. ***</lj-cut>.

During the movie I came up with this ingenious idea that was sort of like, ""Why didn't I think of this before?"", switch my desk and the couch. That way the couch would face the TV, and I wouldn't have my back to the TV when I was at my computer. So now I have more options desk-wise. I'll probably wait until I buy a new desk though to actually try it out. When ever I think about it the viewing angles sort of worry me, but it's really only because they're not what I'm used to. I can get used to having the couch actually face the TV."

I wasn't planning to, but soon after I got home I watched the movie I'd gotten, <lj-cut text=""Year of the Dog""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756729/"" target=""_new"">Year of the Dog</a>. It was cute, but teetered on the edge of being annoying. I know my mom will love it, but she also loves dogs. It has some nice jabs at certain types of people. I just loved that her brother's family had their Christmas tree out by the pool, such a southern California thing. The only dog in the movie that I really liked was Pencil. He was adorable. ***</lj-cut>.

Then I watched <i>Big Brother</i>, which was a rather lame episode. During which I applied for and was accepted for a new credit card with 0% interest for 12 months so I can purchase my computer.

After work today I have to drive to Woodland Hills to replace the book I lost. With traffic it's probably going to take a year to get there. They close at 8, I hope I can make it."

I have a strong feeling that the show will be cancelled not because it's bad, but because it's too smart for television if that makes any sense. Hopefully ABC will give it a better shot than Fox gave to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361256/"" target=""_new"">Wonderfalls</a>. The pilot ended on such an amazing charming note, that I can't wait until October 10th to see the second episode. Everyone else is just gonna have to wait until the 3rd to see the first episode.****</lj-cut>.

Afterward I talked a bit about TV with this girl who was sitting next to me. I feel that the whole ""I work in reality TV"" thing worked against me a bit. I'm getting very excited for premiere week now. Too bad the best show coming back is being held as a mid-season replacement.

I got home fairly late but didn't go right to bed because I'm obsessing about getting a new iMac and new desks. <lj-cut text=""Here is another one I really like:"">Here is another one I really like:<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v697/ThisGuyIKnow/bizchair1_1964_695061768.gif"" alt=""""></center><br>But I dislike the CD racks since I don't use CDs.</lj-cut>.

But I've come to the realization that the desk I have now other than the height of the monitor is perfect because the angled edge leaves more space to get into the bathroom. Oh decisions, decisions. Tonight I'm gonna stop at the grocery store on the way home to pick up a few things, and hopefully a movie. Then it's two hours of <i>Big Brother</i> related entertainment. My life is so exciting."

To me it felt a lot like <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069704/"" target=""_new"">American Graffiti</a>, but a few years older. Now they're back from college and settling down. I wasn't alone in this sentiment. The write-up in the 1001 book alludes to <i>American Graffiti</i> as well. I feel very much the same way about this film as I did that one. It doesn't really seem to go anywhere or do anything. I guess we're supposed to love it based on the feeling of nostalgia we get from watching it. I liked how Daniel Stern's character was obsessed with his record collection. **</lj-cut>.

Sunday I again dawdled about, but I did make it out of the house to do laundry. Eventually I watched <lj-cut text=""The Fly""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/"" target=""_new"">The Fly</a>. Pretty cool. The sequence where the fly gets into the machine is really cool. Also his baboon is adorable. In fact the whole movie has a lot of ""that's cool"" about it. I really liked the ending, but wished she would have pulled the trigger right away when it was still  like he was asking for it. It's certainly one of the more accessible Cronenberg movies. ***</lj-cut>.

Also I'm really keen on buying a new iMac. I'm going to wait until 10.5 comes out though. I should start putting money aside now since I'll have to buy a new desk too.

For anyone that doesn't know what it is, or why the guy at Hollywood video wouldn't let it be my birthday rental, it's a documentary on Golden Gate bridge suicides. They spent a whole year filming the bridge in order to capture the suicides on tape. They inter-cut that footage with interviews with family and friends of the jumpers and in some cases witnesses, and footage of more ordinary goings-on around the bridge. It really is some startling footage, and any time you see people pacing the bridge or whatever you're like, ""Is it going to be that guy?"" Most of the time of course it's not. There are obvious moral and ethical issues involved in filming suicides, but I can't blame them because it's all very compelling and they did call the Bridge Patrol whenever they felt they had a real jumper. The whole this is just sort of heavy in a way that you have to be prepared for going in. The range of feeling and emotion is quite the experience. ***</lj-cut>.

Now I'm at work and contemplating what I could do tonight other than going home and watching a movie. Tomorrow it's looking like quick groceries and laundry. It's next weekend that I'm really looking forward to."

Tuesday I lucked out with the DVD machine at the grocery store and got <lj-cut text=""Unaccompanied Minors""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488658/"" target=""_new"">Unaccompanied Minors</a>. It's a kids movie and the only reason I cared to see it was because it was directed by Paul Feig. It had one other nice highlight though and that was the Allison Jones casting. It had cameos by so many people from <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193676/"" target=""_new"">Freaks and Geeks</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367279/"" target=""_new"">Arrested Development</a>, and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/"" target=""_new"">The Office</a>. It also had some neat songs on the soundtrack from Groovie Ghoulies and MU330. Other than those things it's just a formulaic, kids winning over adults kinda movie. A fun time though. **</lj-cut>.

Wednesday I was getting a little depressed about my birthday, ever since college birthdays have always been a bit of a let down and I actually get a bit sad about being disappointed by a present or whatever especially if I know who ever gave it to me was excited about it. I mean it's almost like I'm letting someone down by not being as excited by their gift as they were by giving it. Also my birthday weekend plans were a bit up in the air and I was just feeling down. After work I watched <lj-cut text=""Brick""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393109/"" target=""_new"">Brick</a>. I give it definite points for trying. I mean, it's this modern high school noir thriller, but it just wasn't able to keep my interest 100%. That certainly isn't a good thing for a movie if it makes me want to do other things while it's on. It was pretty cool though. If I didn't have so many movies on my plate I'd try to watch it again.***</lj-cut>.

Then of course yesterday was my birthday. I went out for lunch with some co-workers to the Cuban restaurant next door, and we all had Cuban sandwiches. The plan was to go out after work with some co-workers, but then not everyone could make it. It would be only me and one other guy so we decided to try for some other night. I didn't really feel like going out anyway. So I stopped at three Hollywood videos on my way home to get free rentals and Subway to get dinner. The guy at the second one wouldn't let me rent <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799954/"" target=""_new"">The Bridge</a> as my birthday rental so he gave it to me free and had me pick another movie as well.

When I got home I watched <lj-cut text=""Cashback""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460740/"" target=""_new"">Cashback</a>. Which is a very independent British sort of comedy, sort of romance based on a short film that was nominated for Oscar last year. I think it was probably better as a short film. The short film because in the short film you could accept his ability to stop time as something just in his imagination, but in the feature version it's clearly some sort of actual ability, which makes it a little harder to accept. It's still a nice little movie though. Kind of sad, kind of happy, all of the above. And it's about more than just artistic nudity. ***</lj-cut>.

So by the end I was feeling much better about my birthday than the day before. The plans I had for Sunday are being moved up until next weekend which is fine by me. I like having something to look forward to. Now I just need to find something tonight, tomorrow night, and Sunday."

Saturday I worked, then went grocery shopping and later to the grove to see <lj-cut text=""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373889/"" target=""_new"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</A>. At the beginning I was really loving it, but it sort of got less good as it went on. I absolutely loved the opening. Visually it reminded me a lot of <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101700/"" target=""_new"">Delicatessen</A>, but then they made it to Hogwart's and it wasn't particularly memorable. I liked all of the room of requirement stuff. If someone hasn't read the books I really don't think the movie would make much sense. I also thought Luna Lovegood was adorable. I guess you can't expect much more of a TV director I guess.**</lj-cut>.

Today I walked down to the Vista to see <lj-cut text=""Superbad""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0829482/"" target=""_new"">Superbad</A>. McLoved it. I really didn't know what to expect. I'm not a fan of the genre, but I think the movie sort of redefines what the R-rated teen comedy. I'm glad I went to see it in the theater with a nice full audience because if I just watched it at home by myself it wouldn't have been the laugh out loud romp that it was. It's nice that Judd Apatow can do some good stuff as well. It's funny to see all the Allison Jones casting regulars scattered about. An enthusiastic ****. I stole the enthusiastic part from Roeper.</lj-cut>.

For dinner I cooked the pork shoulder that I'd got on sale at Vons. It was an attempt to try new things in the kitchen and I must say it was a success. I boiled all of them, and froze the rest so I can I pull them out and grill them up for an awesome dinner. Since the water I boiled the pork in had a bunch of fat and pork flavor I decided to make some soup out of it so I threw in some split peas and did my best. Anyone want to come over for some split pea soup or some grilled pork?"

Tuesday night I was going to go see Nu-tra at Safari Sam's with that girl I went out with last weekend, but I didn't want to be out late so that I could get a full nights sleep to help fight the illness. Instead we out for ice cream at this weird little place near L.A.C.C. called scoops.

Only last night did I actually get around to watching a movie. It was <lj-cut text=""Madagascar""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351283/"" target=""_new"">Madagascar</a>. I was a bit perturbed though because despite having it listed as Widescreen, it was a full screen DVD, but oh well. For what it is the movie is really great. Dreamworks Animation are really at the top of the game. They have a huge sophistication in having adult appeal in their family movies. I loved all the different movie references, especially the <i>American Beauty</i> one. It also had some very well thought out and interesting shots. I loved the part where they were all in crates on the boat and were divided up on the screen. It's all very well put together and the animation style worked. It almost had a 2-D style to it in that everything was built upon very basic shapes. I just wish I hadn't been so tired so I could get into the movie more. I don't see much reason to watch it again though any time soon. Maybe if I'm ever baby-sitting or something I'll make them watch it with me. But I never babysit. ****</lj-cut>.

Afterward that was a very exciting <i>Big Brother</i>. I'm so glad America figured out how to use the America's player twist to the advantage of making the show more interesting.

I made a point of not getting my hopes up so that I could actually enjoy it and I very much did. The movie falls sort of half way between the old good Simpsons and the lame new Simpsons. It covered the gamut in terms of humor. I was also incredibly glad that the pig was a plot device and not just a non-sequiter. I'm also glad they had two Easter eggs in the credits not just one. The reprive of the Spider Pig theme song and teh Springfield anthem both made it worth sitting through the pages and pages of Korean animators. ****</lj-cut>. The second movie was <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/"">Ratatouille</a>, but I must admit I didn't pay much attention to it. It's cute, but I can't really count myself as having seen it.

Visually it's really great, but it's just not something that draws me in. **</lj-cut>.

Sunday I worked yet again, logging instead of transcribing. I got distracted by the solution that I came up with instead of buying a new receiver, I'm buying a device to hook my phonograph into my computer and then a set of computer speakers. I rushed to Fry's after work because once I get my mind set on something I like to have it there and ready, but their in-store price was $10 more than their online price and they don't match it, so instead I ordered them from Amazon. In the meantime I have no audio coming out of my computer so I don't even know if I get an IM unless I happen to be sitting there. When I finally got home I watched <i>Big Brother</i> which is still quite the interesting season, during which I made the realization that I need to move my antenna out of the closet in order to get better reception for channel 2.1 so on the way home today I'm going to the bank and the hardware store to buy some shelf brackets. I should buy some sort of saw too."

Last night after work I did get around to the dishes, then I had date. I met up with this girl to go to an awesome little bar downtown Bordello to see Gwendolyn who I saw years ago. It was a pleasant little night and it didn't even bother me that much that I didn't get home until almost 1:30. As for the date it was pleasant. I felt like I was talking too much, and sometimes it's hard for me to imagine that someone else would actually be interested in what I have to say. We discussed maybe going to see Harry Potter at the drive-in over the weekend, but who knows if that'll happen.

There were some subtle high brow jokes thrown in there though. Like several Dickensian references and a reference to Dickensian references. Not exactly something you would expect in such a film. Of course it's not a very movie though. It's exactly what you'd expect from those two. The other funny thing is a lot the voices they use in it are the South Park voices, how unoriginal can they get? **</lj-cut>.

After wards I just went to bed because I had to get up at the crack of dawn for a 7a.m. call time in the valley. I was glad to be able to help out. I pretty much ended up gaffing and being the A.C.. Such things always make me feel slightly inadequte but at the same time they remind me how much I do know and how I'm able to figure thigns otu and make them work. The short film was about auditioning for music videos so there were scantily clad girls all over the place. The second day was 8a.m. until about 1 a.m. so I came home exhausted and went straight to bed to get up 5 hours later.

It's the first time I've really been (I can't even think of words, I want to say in charge of, but that's not really the full situation) of other people. I think we're all getting paid the same amount though which kind of sucks. I should have talked about money in the interview but it never came up and now I'm sort of feeling like a loser for not. Of course I'm definitely in with these people and they'll continue to hire me in the future. And that's probably more important in the run than a few more dollars a day.

Anyway tonight when I got home I watched <lj-cut text=""Bubble""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454792/"" target=""_new"">Bubble</A>. What's with all these slow movies that take place in depressing places. I mean I do kind of like this kind of movie. It just seems like it's something I've been watching a lot of lately. I guess that's sort of the life you live if you drop out of high school. And I guess some people become murders. The casting interviews on the DVD were really interesting and give insight into why, how they cast locals, if there is a large enough pool that sort of thing can really make a movie better. It's certainly an interesting movie regardless and it did set a new precedent with it's simultaneous theatrical, cable, and DVD release. That was two years ago though and it seems no one has tried it since. ***</lj-cut>.

Tomorrow is friday but I'm working all weekend on a a colleague's short film. So I don't get to sleep in for quite some time.

Also last night I watched <lj-cut text=""Duck Season""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407246/"" target=""_new"">Temporada de Patos</A>.

It's a cute little movie. The black and white photography is really striking and it has some great shots that just linger for no reason other than visual interest. I don't like that it had to be about drugs though. I don't think pot brownies were necessary for that type of nothing contemplative day.

Saturday I had a couple of evening plans both of which sort of fell through. I say sort of because one was a last minute date that she wasn't 100% sure she could make. The other was going to a club with a friend from orange county who comes all the way up to L.A. to go to this club. Of course I have zero interest in that sort of club, but I was going to go just to see her. But then her boyfriend decided to go to and I had a total social anxiety breakdown about going. So I decided I better not.

I called up eD and we went to Korean Tofu place and then to this bar that was really a restaurant that we should have just gone to in the first place. Not a bad sort of guys night out though, even though I hate the phrase guys night out. My friend kept texting me to come to the club though, maybe I should have.

We had we'll see plans about hanging out today (sunday) but of course that didn't happen. To get out of the house I took my latest set of headphones back to Fry's I think I'm done with all that now.

I watched the movie <lj-cut text=""Havoc""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285175/"" target=""_new"">Havoc</A>. Interestingly enough it's directed by the noted documentary director Barbara Kopple and written by Stephan Gaghan. I must say the image it gives off Los Angeles is quite, well, wrong. I highly doubt PP kids are scared to drive through downtown L.A. They act as if just being there is dangerous. It's all a bit much and stereo typical. I also think it's crazy that Anne Hathaway gets naked multiple times, but not always in sexy ways. The whole thing is just very unsettling. I guess it's supposed to be though. **</lj-cut>.

I got to go home early cause there wasn't much else to do today. So when I got home I watched <lj-cut text=""Syriana""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737/"" target=""_new"">Syriana</A>. I saw it at the theater when it came out in my Oscar viewing tradition. I was a bit drowsy and I really felt like I'd missed something. It certainly made more sense this time around. It's all these snippets of conversations that all lead up to some big time corruption/conspiracy. I love though how it all builds up to a climactic finale of things going boom or rather cutting away just before the big boom. It certainly makes you think. ***</lj-cut>.

Then I took the metro up to North Hollywood for a production meeting for the short I'm helping out with next weekend, came home and watched <i>Big Brother</i>.

Also today I thought my parents were missing. Both of their cell phones have been off for days and they weren't answering at home either. I was getting a bit worried and actually called my brother. It turns out they were camping and just never told me. I was genuinely worried for a bit though."

"event","So this morning I started a new job on a show that I'm not allowed to disclose. It's still shooting so I just went in to help them set up their offices to begin post-production, when I'll start transcribing for the next 6 weeks or so.

When I got home I finished watching <lj-cut text=""Long Way Round""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403778/"" target=""_new"">Long Way Round</A> It's a seven part BBC mini-series that documents Ewan McGregor and his buddy Charley Boorman as they drive their motorcycles from London to New York the long way round. It's just an incredible story of human endeavor. It's got highs and lows it's just incredible. I've been so blown away by the entire series that it's just hard for me to bring any of it to words. It really makes me wish I was independently wealthy and incredibly charismatic so I could go on adventures like this. Maybe one of these unicycle tours would turn out to be something like that. *****</lj-cut>.

After I finished watching it I found out Ewan, Charley, and Claudio are in Africa as we speak filming where they are riding from Scotland to South Africa. BBC is doing daily updates on their website. I almost want there adventure be done so I can watch it on TV."

"event","It's my last day of ""vacation"" I didn't even leave the house. Instead I buckled down and watched the 4 hour silent epic, <lj-cut text=""Napoleon""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018192/"" target=""_new"">Napoleon</a>. I made it through the first tape without problems, but during the second tape I kept getting distracted so when it finished recording I watched it all again, but in fast forward. It's much more tolerable at double speed. As a whole it has the same problem that most silent films do and that's that the pace is far too slow for a modern sensibility. I can't imagine watching the original 333 minute version. 223 minutes was plenty. While the film itself is far from being great it has some very interesting things about it. There is a lot of ""Russian Montage"" in it that does serve the story. And I must say triptych portion at the end is pretty incredible. Watching it on video you sort of miss out because the picture has to shrink down to fit on the T.V. but I can only imagine how cool it would be in a theater with the curtains opening and getting that much more picture. I especially loved how it wasn't always a continuous image. The image on the sides sometimes just create a thematic proscenium in a really cool way. Despite it's technical innovation and whatnot it's hard to give it more than **</lj-cut>.

Now it's just TV for the rest of the night. I have to get up early to call the unemployment people because they sent me a form to fill out again because it was ""Incomplete or inaccurate"" but I don't know what I was missing. Then it's off to my new job."

"event","After I wrote my entry on Saturday I watched <lj-cut text=""Fargo""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/"" target=""_new"">Fargo</A>. I think it's the accents and dialects that really make this film as great as it is. I had completely forgotten about the true story disclaimer at the beginning and never realized that it was fake and they never even let on to it. That's brilliant. ****</lj-cut>.

Sunday I spent all day at USC for the Best of Festival screenings.

First was <lj-cut text=""American Fork""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790612/"" target=""_new"">American Fork</A>. It was basically <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/"" target=""_new"">Napoleon Dynamite</A> but with plot. Subdued stories about losers really seem to be the rage. They are easy to relate to. ***</lj-cut>.

After a short break was the movie <lj-cut text=""Rocket Science""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477078/"" target=""_new"">Rocket Science</A>. What a concept, a movie about High School debate competitions with a protagonist with a terrible stutter. It's cute though and the whole time you just hope, hope, hope that he'll overcome it, win the tournament and the girl. Gladly though he doesn't. No Hollywood ending needed. I fell in love with the girl too, despite her being quite the aggressive bitch, so clearly the filmmaker had talent. ***</lj-cut>.

After more Q&A stuff and a reception in the courtyard where I felt awkward and weird until a nice girl came up and talked to me. I need to get better at doing that myself instead of waiting for someone else to initiate things. She even remembered my name and said goodbye after the movie. I need to be more like that.

The last movie was <lj-cut text=""Charlie Bartlett""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423977/"" target=""_new"">Charlie Bartlett</A>. It's so odd to see Anton Yelchin all grown up. I worked with him on a short film when he was 11 or 12, and still playing in the dirt with his army men. The film had a really great feel to it. It's doubtful though that such a nerdy type kid would rise up and be everyone's hero. I need to work on my ""Hi, I'm Charlie"" maybe that's the secret. I just loved the spirit of the film. The writer of the film is now working on <i>Youth in Revolt</i> The book only came out about 10 years ago. I talked to him briefly about it and just found him on Myspace to make that connection that might turn into some sort of employment opportunity. ****</lj-cut>.

Since I don't start my next job until wednesday I decided to not work today or tomorrow since it's my last days off for awhile. I drove all the way to the Sunland-Tujunga library to get a copy of <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018192/"" target=""_new"">Napoleon</A>. Even though it's an abridged version it's still almost 4 hours. I hope to tackle it tomorrow.

Tonight I watched <lj-cut text=""Belle de Jour""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061395/"" target=""_new"">Belle de Jour</A>. I expected more of Luis Bunuel. The film was just so very ordinary. It's incredible though that he can make a movie about prostitution without any nudity. **</lj-cut>."

"event","Thursday was a long day on <i>Dirty Sexy Money</i> walk/running around New York Street at Paramount as a UPS guy. I didn't have much time for anything else that day.

Yesterday I didn't have to get to set until the evening so in the afternoon I watched <lj-cut text=""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045810/"" target=""_new"">Gentelmen Prefer Blondes</A>. I'm pretty indifferent to the whole thing. The sexuality both Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russel exude isn't something I'm particularly attracted to. I will admit though that the rest of the night I was singing ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend.**</lj-cut>.

In the afternoon around 2 o'clock just when it was too late to do anything about it I realized that I had probably gotten a parking ticket. Which I did. There goes $50 for forgetting to move my car on street sweeping day.

In the evening I headed over to CBS Radford to be a frat again on <i>Greek</i>. It was a fun night. I noticed someone else had a Nintendo DS so had some multiplayer Mario fun. I also met someone nice and was talking to her most of the evening, but failed completely to ask for her number or anything like that. I never even asked her name, so I can't even look her up on myspace. That's the one thing I really need to get better at. I have no problems starting the conversations, it's just taking that next step that I have trouble with.

When we wrapped on <i>Greek</i> headed over to the Big Brother house to visit someone I know who works over there and it was his all-night shift. It was 1:30 in the morning, but it's strange to walk into their offices and see so many people working. The house guests were all still up so of course they have to be working. Of course I couldn't go into the house of course, but I must say their control room is amazing, with its huge bank of monitors.

Today has been far less entertaining or productive. All day I was just feeling lazy. I eventually got around to doing my laundry, but it took me forever to get around to it. I'll probably still watch a movie.

Tomorrow I'm going to a bunch of screenings at USC, and monday I'm thinking about going to the library downtown to get <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018578/"" target=""_new"">Wings</A>, but of course it's only on VHS, so I'm thinking instead I might order it from China. If I get 4 or 5 movies it's only like eleven dollars."

"event","Well, it looks like I haven't gotten around to this since monday. On monday I drove to Lincoln Heights to go to the library and pick up a movie that no other library in the system had, and only on VHS for that matter. The movie was <lj-cut text=""Celine and Julie Go Boating""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071381/"" target=""_new"">C&#233;line et Julie vont en bateau</A>. I think it was mostly the lack of availability that made me so excited about seeing this film. Sadly it did not live up to my expectations. Had the video quality been better I might have had a better impression of the movie. It's sort of what I expected, a late French New Wave film. The book explains it as sort of an Alice in Wonderland  tale, and I sort of get that. I just wasn't as thrilled as I'd hoped to be. My main concern was actually getting a DVD copy made of it, but since I have no interest in ever watching it again I went ahead and sent it to my Mom. **</lj-cut>.

At the end of the night I got some new Nintendo DS games and I stayed up way to late playing <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/Majesco-Cake-Mania/dp/B000LT26UC/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-4199596-1415303?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1184822409&sr=8-1"" target=""_new"">Cake Mania</A>. It's such a silly little game, but highly addictive. It didn't matter though because I was able to sleep in on Tuesday.

In the early afternoon I headed down to meet up with Francis and go to the OC Fair. We went way earlier than we should have and just ended up walking around and sitting down whenever we could find some shade. For dinner I decided I wanted to get the grossest most disgusting fair food we could find so I had a Krispy Kreme chicken sandwich. It's a chicken sandwich made with a jelly doughnut. It wasn't dipped in batter and deep fried though. Pretty tasty either way.

The real reason to go to the fair was to see Weird Al. I haven't seen him in years. I think it was the Running with Scissors Tour so probably 1998 or 1999. He sure puts on a heck of a show. He played for about 2 hours covering so much material that I'm thinking I know he's going to do an encore, but I couldn't imagine what else he had up his sleeve. He whips out Albuquerque for a 15 minute encore. Quite a time.

I got home at midnight and had to get up at 5:30 for work. It was a mob attacking the perps as they come out of court thing for <i>Cold Case</i>. I hadn't been at Warner Brothers for a long time. Luckily they only had one of the DVDs I wanted, so I didn't spend more than I should have on cheap DVDs. On the way home I stopped at Fry's to switch out my WiFi router and to a library in North Hollywood that was just very odd in many ways.

when I got home I watched <lj-cut text=""Sunrise""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018455/"" target=""_new"">Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans</a>. Best Picture 1927. Technically <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018578/"" text=""_new"">Wings</a> gets called the first Best Picture, there were two that year. <i>Wings</i> won for Production, and <i>Sunrise</i> won for Unique and Artistic Production. An interesting note I just read about the awards Chaplin was removed from the Best Actor category, in order to level the playing field. They just gave him his own award instead. Anyway, <i>Sunrise</i> is a really interesting movie. It really doesn't have much story, but it has some great art direction. When it comes to Murnau films though it's hard to beat <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015064/"" target=_new"">The Last Laugh</a>. I prefer this one to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/"" target=""_new"">Nosferatu</a> though.***</lj-cut>.

So I can once again say that I've seen all of the 100 Greatest Films, according to the AFI.

Tomorrow I'm working on a new show <i>Dirty Sexy Money</i>. I'm going to be a UPS-type delivery man. Luckily I don't have to be there until 11:30, and it's nearby at Paramount."

"event","First thing in the morning I started watching <lj-cut text=""Holiday Inn""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034862/"" target=""_new"">Holiday Inn</A>. How can Astaire and Crosby go wrong. The black face number is a bit much though, I guess they could still get away with it in 1941. The thing that I thought was funny about the movie was that at the end of the film they show the Holiday Inn set as a set and make a joke about it being the most exact reproduction Hollywood has ever done. It wasn't a reproduction it was the same exact set. But now they show that there isn't a roof. I thought that was hilarious. **</lj-cut>.

I tired my darnedest to come up with a reason to leave the house so I went and bought some groceries. Not exactly exciting.

When I got back I watched <lj-cut text=""Good Morning Vietnam""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093105/"" target=""_new"">Good Morning, Vietnam</A>. I really didn't need to watch it again. It is what it is. I actually found Robin Williams a bit annoying. ***</lj-cut>.

After <i>Big Brother</i> I had nothing really to do so I watched <lj-cut text=""Ali G Indahouse""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284837/"" target=""_new"">Ali G Indahouse</A>. It is what is. It ranges from great satire to puerile crudeness. Like with many movies I think that a lot people who like a movie like this completely miss the satire and just like the silliness.Martin Freeman as Ricky C even points this out int eh commentary. It does have some really brilliant bits in it like when he breaks in to say that his real Julie is fitter than the one who was playing his Julie in the movie, but they wanted it to be more accessible. I also think it's hilarious that Martin Freeman is in it. <A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443453/"" target=""_new"">Borat</A> is a better movie though. I think it's just that it's a scripted movie and it lacks the brilliant reactions of unsuspecting people. **</lj-cut>.

So today I'm going to the Lincoln Heights library to get a movie that they have the only copy of in the whole L.A. library system."

"event","So yesterday I walked to the library, the bank and the cinema. I went to the theater down the street to see <lj-cut text=""Sicko""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386032/"" target=""_new"">Sicko</A>. You really do have to take it with a grain of salt cause it's really just a series of U.S. managed care and then then praise stories of the Universal Health systems of other countries. He of course glosses over some of the problems those countries face. But of course Michael Moore has to simplify everything to the most basic, my way, good, their way, bad. It's a good thing I agree with him that it's silly that we don't have social healthcare in this country. I just need to remember not to read teh stupid IMDB message boards on it. ***</lj-cut>.

After I walked home I watched <lj-cut text=""Reds""><A HREF=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082979/"" target=""_new"">Reds</A>. It's kind of exciting when a movie can be three hours long and work. I guess that's just what a Warren Beatty can do. Who would have thought that the early leftist movement in America could make such a grand film. I really liked the way they used the interviews to sort of substantiate the history. The film also did an amazing job of condensing time in montages. They also do a great job of keeping a semi-ambigious historical figure somewhat ambiguous as to not mess with historical inaccuracy. A very good film though. ***</lj-cut>.

Now it's sunday and I'm trying my darnedest to come up with something to do."

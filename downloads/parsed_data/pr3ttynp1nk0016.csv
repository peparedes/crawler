"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ccff>well I dont know why I have been thinking so much lately, but i have. About everything. I just cant explain it all at once but I am scared. I am turning 18 soon and i know that isnt scary for most because they still have support from their parents but me, its a totally different story. This is because by law they arent responsible and they are looking forward to that. Not only that has me thinking though. so much is on my mind and no one can help me. Tom actually wants to help, really badly. The truth is that he does. He helps out sooo much, he takes care of me and cooks and treats me like a queen. Well he says princess until we are married then im his queen. I am scared i will mess this up with me and him. I dont know why i think that because I wont hurt him and i would never think about being with someone else and cheat on him but i juust really do want to spend the rest of my life with this person. I have never been so happy and so alive before. I am completely in love with a person that does not care what anyone thinks. He wants the whole world to know he loves me and he wants to make sure i am happy all the time. He is so perfect its like i dont want him to break if i touch him kind of thing. I know we will be together and in love forever with each other and im really happy about that! I am really tired and confussed and i dont know why. Im ddriving myself crazzy thinking about it...what do I do? I know i am fine but really i am running around inside and just freaking out! </FONT></STRONG></P>"

I didnt know that but atlike 8:30 i called him while i was at work and he was all ""omg are you ok, i am on my way to your house to see if you are ok, then if you werent there i was gonna go to the hospital because i didnt know what happened to you!!!"" isnt that like totally sad?!! we normallly talk through out the day but this time i couldnt so like he forgot i had to go to work and so all day he was all freaked out. Thats so cute though that he came all the way to my house to check up on me because it shows how much he really cares. then he decided he didnt want to leave so we went to villiage inn and then came back to my house and we took showers and went to bed.

I had the chance to really sit down and talk to Tommy about what I want from this relationship and what he wanted to. We both want the same things and we are so incredibly happy. The love that we have for eachother is beyond anything I have ever heard of. I have heard of all of these relationships and even been in one where it is for the most part good and there are fights here and there and the couple doesnt know exactly how to be but the thing is that we dont have that. We are always happy and never for one second do we live our lives as if we have forever to make things great. We both live our life as if it were our last day. We talked and decided that eventually we are getting married and we are going to spend the rest of our life together. He sat down tonight he said and talked to his family and told them everything and they just said how much they love me and how they completely support everything he wants and everything I want. I mean we stay with each other almost everynight, practically already live with each other. </FONT></STRONG></P>

Then she came down and we went to joe's because he was having a party. THEN Tay went home and Tommy called me. Like for the first time in these last 2 1/2 months this was our first time i waskinda annoyed at him. Like we werent in a fight or anything we just were kinda OFF with each other. We were supposed to hang out friday but he hung out with travis so maybe that was why. But anyways when he called me he asked if i wanted to come stay the night over with him. Even though i was annoyed i love being with him so i went over. as soon as i got there he gave me a hug and said lets go on a walk. But then we decided it was too cold so we went for a drive to a park and talked. He is so amazing i am not even kidding you...he just looked at me and said i am soooooo sorry that i didnt see you tonight...that was so mean and im sorry i hurt you. I was like omg im not even mad at you. It was craazy how awesome we are and how when it got just a LITTLE off...not even a lot at all but just a little how awesome he makes everything. Then saturday I slept and talked to Russel about working out and stuff. Then went out to eat with tommy.

The words that he says to me and how he explains his love for me is amazing. I cant even explain it that well into depth. I always search for the right words and it never comes out right. He just says what he thinks and he is the sweetest person I have ever met. I spent my whole weekend with him. Normally we hang out with our friends on the weekend too but this time we needed to spend time with each other. I stayed at his house every night and I just really felt so at home there. I was telling his mom that! She is really sweet to me. I love his dad too! omg...i just love his family. They make me feel so welcome its crazy. Well they tell me all the time that they love me so im thinking they like me! lol.

Then we went to Villiage Inn and had breakfast after midnight haha. It was yummy! Then we went romping up to the top of OUR mountain haha. We have this really awesome spot on the top of this mountain and we were up there. Then we went romping through mud and that was fun we were flying all over the place. And then we went to his house and said hey to his mommy and then we got ready for bed and just laughed all night untill we fell asleep. Then I woke up with him right next to me and he was just so cute. He smiled at me and then told me i was beautiful and then we fell back asleep a few times. Then finally we got up and got carrot cake Haha. FATTY's we are! GOSH! lol. We could stop hugging each other. It was so wierd how comfortable i was. Then I went home around 11 and went back to sleep and i didnt wake up till 5 in the pm. then i went to a work meeting and NOW i am sitting here at home...im not going out tonight because I dont want to party and I dont really feel like it.

Well I have so many opportunities out there and he has so many here because of where he is at with firefighting and schooling and stuff. Well I told him that basically I would be stupid to stay in AZ because of a boy because DUH i was with Nick for 3 years and we didnt work out. SO anyways...as I was thinking about things and talking to Tommy about it I began to realize who was sitting in front of me. Every moment that me and Tommy are together is the best part of my life. I am always happy and he has explained to me how to make the best out of every situation. I mean he told me that it is imortant to live everyday like it was your last day and he is seriously an awesome person. I am devoted to him like I have never been before. I Love Tommy so much and I just like broke down because I told him like rarely relationships last when they are young and i dont want to stay in AZ because I cant leave him and then it not work out between me and him. So we left it as well we will see. I talked to him the rest of the night about it and i mean we went into all details and stuff and I finally decided that we are perfect and he is my soul mate. We are seriously meant to be together. I dont know why in the world I would WANT to say this considering how BAD i want to go to LA but He is the ONE. I know this because the feeling i get everytime he moves and the look he gets on his face and the look i get on mine when we kiss. I have never felt so strong for someone and I love everything about him. So all in all...AZ is gonna be my home for a while....</FONT></STRONG></P>

WOW okay I wasnt expecting that one but I understood because I was feeling the exact same way.

<P><FONT color=#66ff99 size=5>I am excited because on saturday I am going to do Tara and her friends hair and I am going to do Tara's hair for homecoming. I love that stuff. It gives me a break from color. I am also coloring this girls hair from Mesa High tomorrow at like 3:30 or 4. So I have a buisy schedule on top of my own. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff size=4>I really want to change my ways. I really want to get my head on straight but I dont know where to start??? HELP!!! I wish I knew exactly what to do and how to handle things but I dont know how so I just do whatever at the time and i guess it isnt always good. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff33 size=5>I am happy because FINALLY people are staying out of my life with Nick and stop saying shit. Its really the best feeling in the world and I am happy!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#99ffff size=4>I know that if I had chances to take back things I did in the past I would. I know I cant so I just need to live with it. I am really wierd right now at this point in my life because I am doing so much and I dont really know what to do with everything. I think I am on the right track but for example this is what I am going through:&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I should start working as an assistant at a nice salon now before I get my license but I dont want to quit my job and I dont know where I want to work at when I get my license. And I dont want to fail school. And my family problems are almost at its worst. I hate living at home with a dad that doesnt talk to me or even care and a mom that thinks her boyfriend is her life. I mean I know that and im only 17. I just want to move out and I cant afford it. And I dont know I could go on and on and on and on but im not going to. WELL.....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#33ff33>PROBLEM- Well first of all nick was going to this party with his friends tonight and I asked if I could go with him because this gurl's house he is going to well lets just say she always calls him and she had her boyfriend mouth off to me once...well anyways, he says no matter what I say he is going and then he said I couldnt go. So i asked again and he finally said alright. So we have plans to go right...well this morning my friend nerina called and said her friend was having a party and asked if I wanted to go. And I asked her if I did ended up going if I could bring Nick. She was all ya OMG yes I want you guys to g o. so I was just planning on going with nick and if we werent having any fun we would go to my friends party. well Nick then tells me there isnt going to be a party and so i was like great then we can go to this girls house. and he was all ""NO I DONT WANT TO GO&lt; LETS GO SEE A MOVIE!!!"" I was all well i dont want to really go see a movie so will you please go with me. Well then he gets outraged and starts YELLING at me telling me how fucked up i am for ditching him when I asked him to go with me and he didnt want to go. so he is going to a CLUB with his friends and he hung up on me and wont answer my call and then i just found out from someone that he lied to me or has been and it isnt a big lie its just stupid and its HIM going against his RULE he put on us. I dont know what to do.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff size=5>If anyone has any suggestions please let me know how I should handle this so I dont screw things up. If I am the wrong person in the situation then tell me...just be honest because I am getting tired of being told I am ALWAYS wrong when I dont think i am wrong at all.</FONT></P>

"event","Alright...starting with friday! On friday, Me, Tina, Estrella, Marco, and Chilo all went to Jamie Moore's house and got drunk.&nbsp; Chilo drove my car because he didnt drink. After Jamie's house we all went to Fili'B's on Mesa. Dr. and Southern...the one we ALWAYS go to when we are drunk lol. Estrella and Tina talked for a while in the bathroom while I ate with Chilo and Marco. Then some drama went down with a bunch of us drunk girls and we went home and went to bed. Then next morning which is SATURDAY! we all went to the lake. Again this is ME, MARCO, TINA, ESTRELLA, CHILO, and SCOTTY (my dad)!! We had so much fun! omg It was tight. When we al got back to my house my dad rented me the CHRISTINA AGUILERA concert on DVD and so everyone watched it with me. It was sweet. SCOTTY made us dinner and it was GOOD!!! Then we all went to MIKEs that night. But Marco couldnt go and I was sad. I got really really really really drunk though.&nbsp; I hung out with Isaac and Sergio most of the night untill we went and picked up Nadine. Truman and Derik stopped by but then they left. When we got Nadine i came back and I was playing baseball and all I remember was having to jump a wall with everyone to get my ball. and i was wearing sergio's shoes because I didnt want to get my feet dirty from my flip flops and he wore my flip flops haha. We got the ball and then we had to jump the wall again.OMG i dont remember this but Jamie Moore told me we were playing the piano and i just smacked my head on it and then just got up like nothing happened and it was the funniest thing ever. then isaac carried me inside because i was lazzy or i wanted to see jamie and kendra and he wacked my head into the glass door. DICK! haha then i went to sleep and i woke up with a BIG bump on my head! When I woke up MIKEY was walking around with his balls hanging out and i was all omg go away. haha he was calling me MRS SQUID! hahaha it was sooo funny i died laughing. He wore a tie when he had no shirt on and he was drunk at 9 in the morning. MIKEY is so funny when he is drunk. Then sunday rolls around and we went to mikes again that night. THIS time ESTRELLA GOT SOOOOOO DRUNK. She was sooo sick and so i put her to bed and i was like the only one not drunk. It was a lot of fun though. CHILO almost killed me and tina when we went to go get cheese eggs! lol it was scary and then we came back to mikes and made a dozen cheese eggs. ""the cheese needs more eggs!!!!"" haha oh god fun times. Then i went to bed at like 8 in the morning and i was sick. not from drinking...but like i got a cold and i was sick. Monday was estrella's BIRTHDAY! she was sick at the beginning of her 17th b-day but she got better. then we went to Olive garden and then back to estrella's! we had cake and ice cream. THEN chilo ran estrella over at my house when he was backing out with the car. GOING FULL SPEED!!! and they still havent talked because Chilo wont talk to her. WIERD. I talk to marco on the phone every night but we never know what to talk about. I think he knows my whole life story minus the last 2 years and 7 months. he knows about it but i dont talk about it because it wouldnt be good thing to talk about. Anyways, yesterday was tuesday and i worked from 3-8 and I was all loaded from the actfed I took on an empty stomach. i was trippin out. i can barley talk right now because i woke up this wednesday morning really sick. I feel fine though so I am still going to work but i can barely talk. Julianne said i should be fine so its all good. well that was most of my weekend. I know i left parts out and im sorry but oh well. OMG SCHOOL starts for me one week from today because i have beauty school the 11th it sucks! then i have my senior year the next day! DAMN! well im gonna go now. PEACE!!!"

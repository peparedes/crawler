I mean, being hogged tied and crying cuz of the pain deffinitly triggered this but now, its been 2 hours since then and I have this empty feeling. I was sitting here like 5 min ago dowloading music and tears started running down my cheek and im thinking what a pathetic loser I am, I have no reason to be crying. I absolutly hate being in these moods, mostly because its so opposite of who I am. I dont think ive found my place here.. i mean i have friends and they are really cool but I havnt found anyone or anywhere where I can feel 100% comfortable and I miss that feeling. I felt like I had it and one day woke up and it was gone. I dont even know what the fuck im talking about anymore.

"event","wow. Its been a while. I went though this stage where writting was a waste of time and I was just too lazy but its already making me feel a lil bit better. Better, only Im not sure what Im feeling beter about. Hmm, thats kind of funny now that I think about it. So forgive me if you missed me, but Im back. And Im moving. Into the states! Its been how long.. let me count.. 1, 2, 3...11 years! Im so ready for a change, <b>so</b> ready. 
I hate saying goodbye. A year ago I was thinking how much i was going to hate my senior year because of the lack of friends I had in my grade and I can honestly say this has been the best year of my high school experience. So many good things have happened to me and I wont let the bad cancel them out. 
I made new friends. New amazing friends. People I never thought Id be speaking to and I couldnt see my Senior year as memorable without them. We did crazy shit. Crazy shit that got us in trouble but was all worth it. I took risks. I took the biggest risk of my life and I got the best thing out of it and I wouldnt change that for the world. It may seem a little late to be looking back at my senior year but its now that its starting to hit me. Now that I have to let go of people I never thought I'd meet and Im gonna miss those faces. 
If I could give anyone anything before they leave id give them the satisfaction of knowing that they made a difference in someones life. So thank you, I just hope you all had as much fun as I did and I wish everyone the best of luck in the years to come. We are growing up bitches, dont it feel good!"

I sit here in amazement at how selfish one person can be. 
A coldness runs through me, as if my veins were filled with ice water. 
And I hate it.
In the dim light I could see my regrets flash before me and yet I just lay there as they pass, not trying to stop them.
And then that selfish person is no longer selfish but now tied up in the moment and it turns to lust and immaturity and it all goes back to those little things I want to be blinded from. 
I rather not know what will make me cry.
Please, be that strong person I cannot be. Protect me from what it is you know I dont want to hear.
It feels as though you are the only one who understands and at the same time cares the least.
Its that feeling you get when you see something bad happening and as its happening in slow motion you let it happen without preventing it.
Its selfishness that got the worst of me."

Yeah so its been a while. Forgive me. Usually i would post up pictures which would explain how my summer has been so far, but that would take too long cuz there would be many pictures. I can say that so far this has been THE best summer. I felt like Ive done so much already. I like hanging out with everyone, even if it is just sitting at jesses watching the boys moon people on his web cam. If things go as planned Ill be going to Florida in around a month or so. I cant wait to see him. I miss him <b>so</b> much. Things such seem to be getting better and I cant wait.
Then theres me moving in with Christi as we are educated at camp college and that excites me too.
Im so sick of being brought down by my family and Im sick of letting myself be brought down. So this is me and this is who I am. Im no longer going to wish I was someone else, someone they want me to be, simply because thats too much work and I cant please them. Im sticking to those people who love me for who I am and people like that shouldnt be taken for granted. So thank you, to everyone who doesnt judge me.

I wanted to see how long I could old my arms up for...so I did that for 47 min. And then stood on one foor for a total of 1hr and 36 min. Katy didnt think I could do it for two hrs, so that was my goal. My foot was going to fall off though. I WILL do it for two hrs.
So that was my weekend. I did however go see Troy on friday con Lindsay Paul and Katy! awww, i missed hanging out with them. I really want to see A day without a mexican. Its on the top of my to do list, that and find myself a jet pack."

Im not sure why but I was really happy today, everyone was really happy. Nick couldnt stop saying ""im really happy today""...see, I told you people were happy. Yesterday was not good. I sorta spazzed out durring ceramics and then I had to speak to the ass who frankly, is an ass. Im so frustrated with that boy... <b>I love you Tai!</b>

Yeah so many people dont know what that is. So here is your education for the day. Take notes now, I dont want to repeat this next year.

The 5th of May is not Mexican Independence Day, but it should be!  And Cinco de Mayo is not an American holiday, but it should be.  Mexico declared its independence from mother Spain on midnight, the 15th of September, 1810. So what is cinco de Mayo? it was when 4,000 Mexican soldiers smashed the French and traitor Mexican army of 8,000 at Puebla, Mexico, 100 miles east of Mexico City on the morning of May 5, 1862.

So do we have all that? Good...Im glad.

Like matt Landon, who by the way was very excited to be there. There was this nipple frenzee though. I was asked by two people to lick their nipples, in which at one point matt licked his own. Tai and I peed on the sand cuz we really really had to go. Christi and I met Ashley and Tito. I told Nick I loved him like a brother around 30 times. I serioulsy dont know what I would have done without him being there. He took care of me so well and I owe him.And laura who kept Me and Christi out of the water, but tito and ashley said it wasnt cold at all. haha. I blame Carl for getting me drunk, haha... he was just doing what he was told. And I heart Tais mom, she made fun of us when we got to Tais house. Ok now for the ""but"". It was fun, ye it was... but...I hadnt depending on someone to carry me into the car, or helping me walk straight. Jason was right. its kinda pathetic I was gone by 10. Then again we had to go home at 11. But still...next time it'll all be in moderation. I really wanted to call him last night. Along with the other phone calls I actually did make. (Sorry Katy and Alyssa).
Anyway, here are pics...enjoy!

So brilliant me thinks of ""lets get a watermelong and see who can finish their half the fastest"" So of course we buy a big ass melon, 13.5 lbs.

1.Ignorant people. I say, we ignore the ignorant.
2.My grandfather, long story.
3.<b>The dark</b>...another long story and we have #2 to thank for that.
4.The thought of ending up alone. Not like never getting married... but alone when im like 80 in a house and dieing by my lonesome.
5.Going to L.A.
6.People from Venezuela who live in my house.
7.<b>Him being so far.</b> I miss him.
8.Negative attitudes
9.My dads 40 phone calls a day.
10.Onions. Onions can suck a fatty
11.Goind downstairs hungry, finding your favorite cereal is in the pantry, serving urself a bowl, only to find theres <b>no milk.</b>
12.Pink. not so much anymore, im starting to wear it now.
13.People with trees up their ass',not the stick, but the tree.
14.Not being able to drive legally in both countries
15.Living in Mexico
16.Grape flavored candy. It all tastes like medicine to me.

I think thats It for now..im sure with time the list will grow. Lets hope not. I would like to have a longer list of ""Things that make me happy"" rather than ""Things I dislike""

"event","Im home. Got back last night at around 9ish. I want to go back. hehe I miss him already! It was the best week every though. I know hes prolly thinking ""she was so bored"" NO! (yes i said that in spanish) I had a lot of fun, his friends were super cool and spending time with him was beyond awesome.
""spermacide...so if one of your swimmies gets by it goes <b>ZAP!</B>-Aaron

Hes such a funny kid, he was at the airport with Jason wearing a sombrero and welcomming me to the states.
He wrote me a song...yes girls be jealous. It was the cutest thing anyone has ever done for me. He said he wouldnt mind if I posted the lyrics on here so that is what i be doing. 

<b>I Wish</b>
<b><i>Jason Trueblood</b></i>

Its not right
And its not fair
To you
You shold have someone always there
And who am I 
To say that I
Should be the one to call you mine.

<b><i>Chorus</b></i>
I wish so much that I could be there
And I wish so much that I could be
The one to hold you close to me at night
I was a fool to not choose you
When I had the chance to make you mine.

What can I do
To prove to you
That I care
How can I show
That I love you
More than you know
I would climb
The highest peak
If it meant
Just one moment in your arms.

Why did I wait?
To tell you these things
In my heart
I should have told you
From the start
You mean more to me than the stars

I hope so much that I can be
I hope so much that you can see
How much you mean to me
And I hope so much that you will let me be
The one to hold you close to me at night.

*sigh* So cute. Well I should get ready for.. well im not sure but i have a butt load of laundry to do. Ya'll have a good night!

You're the best thing in my life."

"event","Hi, Hello... ok so this is me, completely sick and tired of my family. I have a feeling this may be long and Id advise you not to read it for it wont entertain you at all.
Basically, theres no way to shorten this but to say im tired. Im physically and mentally tired. Im not one to vent, if anything I tend to bottle things up. Lately though Ive been feeling like crap at school. I notice myself taking it out on others and I want to stop, I figured the only way to do that was to vent. When Im at home, I feel like its just me. At a family gathering, again...just me. I guess you can say I feel alone. But im not really, I mean I have awesome friends and what not but most of them.. actually, almost all of them dont know whats going on. The ones that do I dont want to bother. Even if they did want to hear me out, which I know they would, I wouldnt know where to start, because I dont exactly know what hurts. Its just this pain thats constantly reminding me that no matter what I do I was meant to be apart of this and to stick this out. It just gets so hard though. Im tired of being the tough one that is completely fine with the situation. Im tired of being the mature one and the one with the answers to the problems. I have my own life and Id like to live it. For once, I would like to not care about you or what you have decided to do. You decided on sticking with it. Some may call it brave but I call it naive and selfish. Its not just about you, you have kids...one of which had to experience it in the worst way possible. ""I dont want this to effect you Christina."" Are you kidding me? I was 16. I knew what was going on before you did and I hate him. As much as you and I didnt get along I hated seeing you hurt. Sometimes...actually all the time I felt like it was my fault. Was I too much of a burden for you? Well Im sorry If Im not perfect, but who are you to judge what perfect is? Cuz God knows youre not. 
Sometimes... I wish I would take off this mask. The mask that hides everything as If I were  ashamed of what Im dealing with. Im not. Thats just the only way I know how to handle things. I keep them locked up until all my thoughts, my hurt, and my frustration dont fit anymore in my mind. Im tired of faking that Im ok. 
If you only knew what he put me through. I cried. I cried so much. I still cry. I didnt know one could grow up at the age of 7. It was scary, and lonely. Youll never understand what that was like, ever. If I could at least be told why I was treated that way. There must have been something I did. I was only a kid. It doesnt matter anymore. Nothing matters anymore. You wonder why I want to run? Who would want to stay in this hell hole you call a home? Im ready to live my life and deal with my own problems and be happy for once. I cant wait to be happy."

My family is so disfunctional. Im sure you may think yours is at times.. but no, my family is the worst. They should be shipped off to...Taiwan. I came back from L.A. today tired as caca expecting to get picked up by the parentals and go home, shower and sleep. Oh no, I got to my grammas house only to play a game of <b>Find the Vodka</b>. My grampa is a 'holic but recently he has been taking these pills and what not to make him stop. But my 8 yr. old cousin saw him walk into his room with a big thing of vodka. The second he left his room my two aunts, my cousin and I bagan to look for it. We were unsuccesful. My cousin did manage to find 3 little empty bottles of it though. Finally my aunt say him hide it underneath his pillow, The pillow he was using at the time and was falling asleep. So what happend when he fell asleep? Christina (me) was sent to get it. Dont ask me how I did it, but the ass didnt feel a thing.
 Now im at home, showered and not very tired. But no ones online and those who are seem to be away. I guess I'll just sit here reading my Cosmo, taking notes. hehe.

"event","<b>Things I look for in a guy</b>
1. A sence of humor. If a guy cant make me laugh then theres no need in having a relationship.
2. Romantic. Im not looking for candle lit dinner or anything, but a little romance wouldnt bother me one bit.
3. Knowing your PDA. If theres one thing that bothers me is watching someone suck face while I'm eating.
4. Dont act like a girl. I hate those guys that dont take chances. Like oh i cant go fishing cuz fish smells. Bull! suck it up!
5. Friendlyness. A guy who dislikes everyone or isnt friends with anymore says a lot.
6. Open. If im open with you about certain subjects Id like it if you were too, Im only trying to get to knoe you better.
7.Confident but not Cocky. Dont sit there and complain about you not getting girls when you know you're hot. But please dont be cocky, thats the biggest turn off.
8. Looks...ok sure why not. If a guy is hot its a plus
9. Thats it.. i guess.Im not too picky.
Alright, Im sure everyone is thinking... Christina needs a man. I hope i didnt sound to needy, Im not."

"event","i came up with that subject all by myself..im so proud.
grr this thing stresses me out..
i always wanna write to update you guys but i never get around to it cuz im busy and beccause my computer is slowing than grass growing. 
so ill start with the day i left off..but i wont go into as much detail as usual..it gets old i know.
my spring break turned out to be ok..i went out with amanda woodruff one night and went and saw shan. so that was fun..even though i only saw her for like a half an hour cuz she was going to see her bf. i hung out with nikki everyday obviously..and kari just about everyday..my two favorite girls. i hung out over corys a lot over break..he has the best house and his mom is a sweetheart and always makes us fatties some food. lol 
i worked that saturday and sunday..that sucked but it was good money.
intersession started the week after spring break..it was pretty fun..except for some GAY people in it..but i got over them and learned to enjoy just scrapbooking and ignoring that person. nikki left that tuesday for florida :( i missed her dearly..but i talked to her everyday she was gone and she helped me get through the tough times of intersession. people were bitches during that class..it was really hard and it sucked coming home from school every day crying. but i got over it and moved on.
i had the act that weekend..it kinda sucked..they never give you enough time on those things. i worked that sunday also. 
second week of intersession..
volunteered and worked..nikki got back that thursday..thank god! i was going crazy without the girl. we both worked together that friday night. 
saturday we had our garage moving sale..sold pretty much stuff and gave the rest to salvation army. me and brian and katie went to the reds day game also at 115. then we went to at don pablos. i had a blast with them and hanging out with them made my crappy week soo much better..
sunday was my cousins first communion so i went to that with my mom and a party after..
worked monday and here i am today..packing for chicago..i cant wait its gonna be such a blast..but yeah ill update after i get back sometime next week..i get back sunday..
thanks for listening to my problems and my extremely interesting life :)

well hm last time i talked to yall it was my dads birthday...the 12. and i was in a pretty bad mood and not too positive about life. but things are better and im here to clear some of those crazy things up..but first lets update on the past 2 weeks or so.
sunday march 13 i worked from 10 to 6. i also worked tha monday and volunteered on tuesday. wednesday was de's 17 birthday! happy birthday girlie! we had the parent/daughter bball game on wednesday night. my mom went and so did some parents and siblings and boyfriends...it was fun but we lost to them! lol we were laughing so hard just watching the old people run that we were barely playing. i swear lol. 
thursday the tourny started for march madness...uc won against iowa. rock on!
friday watched more bball...hung out over corys with robby sean matt katie and nikki. it was a blast. and katie finally talked to me! ah! it was amazing
saturday i worked from 10 to 6..it was josh's 18 birthday so i called him and wished him a good one..he invited me to come down to his house that night for a party but i declined and thanked him anyways lol. that night uc played uk and our bball party was at jen's house. it was tons of fun..my parents came and hung out with jen's parents...me katie jen adie, and kari were all there..it was really fun though. even though uc fucking lost! lol ugh it makes me so angry...uk still sucks though. lol :)
i stayed the night at jen's and we got up and went to nick spruiell's bball game againast pez's team at 1...then we played at 2.
we played the 8th graders and wow that was a fun game...jerry got a technical! and i was 2 points from getting a triple double! i had 11 blocks 12 rebounds and 8 points! grr that wouldve been P I M P! haha but i played really good and they messed my fouls up so i sat out the whole third quarter..and they thought i fouled out with like a minute to go in the game so i got astanding ovation and went and sat on the bench and then they figured it out and i went back in. lol so i got an ovation for nothing! haha no but i was k-mart...as nick likes to say! lol billy rashikh paul nikki nick cory katie my mom and tina were all there. it was so fun. and needless to say we won and got trophies for GEYBA. so bball is over and im so sad! I had the most fun this year since bball at st veronica in 8th grade. I hate school ball and im so glad that i decided to do this. yesterday, monday, i worked. and i work this thursday and friday too. i love kari. just so you all know lol. shes a little koala and i love her with all my heart. so yeah..
i get my phone back this saturday..dad decided to reconsider and give it to me back in 2 weeks instead of a month. but i got my bill and it was 56 dollars! ah my mom is mad but she wont tell my dad...but im gonna be getting a new phone under verizon cuz mine is a ripoff. boys are still douches...but im kinda talking to one now...but i dont wanna say more cuz it was jynx it. lol but hopefully that will work out. grades are looking better...expecially in pre cal lol. all my classes are pretty good this trimester. spring break starts friday. hope its a good one...intercession is right after that..and then back to regular class and ap exams in the beginnning of may! i cant wait til summer...hang out my my best friends more...and maybe get closer to some people. get my license april 14! hopefully...lol i think ill pass though. they broke ground on our new house the other day...well not really broke ground...started to mark and tear down unwanted trees. im really excited about our new house. its gonna be so nice.

friday the 4th i went to nick and joe's team game at ge. joe's team won and nick had a lot of explaining to do! haha they were both talking so much crap..and then after we went to frisches with the whole gang...me nick nikki billy emily deanna shaun zac joe and matt...it was a blast. then me nick nikki and joe all went back to my house and cory robby and sean came over and my sister and her boyfriend brian had 2 people over...so we were crammed in the house lol. it was fun though.
saturday i had our tourny game and we lost bad...it was embarassing and i had 4 points...so i was pretty pissed. that night ihad nick kari and nikki over...me and nick played bball before they got there and we played strip...lol i kinda lost. so that was fun.
sunday we picked my parents up from the airport it was good to see my mommy again..i missed her.
went to frisches after school on monday with zac nik and cory. yum
worked tuesday. had practice wednesday night. and an nhs meeting after school wednesday. friday i worked with nik and we went out to eat after and back to her house. and i got my report card yesterday..
and wow am i screwed.
got an f on spanish exam and d on pre-cel exam...but still ended up with 3 a's and 2 b's.
and spanish i got screwed over on cuz we did group projects on 3/4 of the exam and the three parts we did together we got 6/20 10/20 and 12/20. and the part i did on my own i got a 17/20. so yeah i was LIVID!
and pre cal i just suck at..no other explanation. so yeah my dad took my cell for a month and my tv out of my room for a month. i was so pissed...so if you wana get ahold of me call the house! 
ugh ive been in the worst mood...woke up to finding out the stuff about my cell and tv and then cried for about 3 hours straight no joke cuz it sucked. and then took a nap and woke up with a horrible headache. and then katie and brian came over for my dads birthday..and now they're gone so i have absolutely nothing to do and life blows right about now. called shan and shes busy as usual..why do i even try. nikkis busy...i dont have other friends to hang out with.
gosh i know i sound like a complainer but GOD! i just wanna vent..no matter how hard i try i feel like it all backfires..
my grades..i work my butt off to get good grades and get screwed in the ass by that..
my friends..nikki and me just dont get along sometimes and i dont even know shannon anymore..my one true best friend. 
boys...lets not get started..josh is a douche and not even worth fighting for anymore...many others i have tried for that have been assholes and ive given up on.
my dad..ugh his like on goal in life is to piss me the f off. and it works. and sometimes i wonder if he had the chance if he would make two of my brother and get rid of me. cuz he cares about everything in my brothers life and NOTHING in mine. except me getting fucking good grades. he doesnt know anything about the real me. and we're never going to have a good relationship.
my dog..i miss my dog so much. i cant even describe what i feel about that. try having something there everyday since you were 5 and then have it just die so fast and leave you with nothing but memories. i think about him all the time and just want him to come back so i can pet him and cuddle with him and just say i love you scotty boy. 
damn im such a whiner. but this thing helps. and im glad i got that out.

well im off to prolly go to bed...ha go to bed at 8.30 on a saturday night. how cool am i.

Last weekend was interesting..worked on friday night and went out to eat afterwards with nikki josh and his friend michael. saturday night i went out with josh and michael again..well first me and josh went down to newport and hung out for a little then back to josh's house and he cooked dinner for me and michael. then we went over to his friend matts house. then he took me home. it was kinda weird to be with him again...but it was fun. 
sunday i worked from 10 to 6 and wwent out to lunch with josh at skyline. dont get any crazy ideas..me and josh arent together like that..at least thats what i think..who knows whats going on in that kids head.
i worked monday and volunteered tuesday and worked wednesday. we had a half day wednesday and me and nikki went prom dress shopping it was great...and went out to eat..at frisches lol. where else.. :)
thursday night i went over my sister's dorm and hung out with her and her boyfriend Brian. then friday i went with brian to uc..college visit type thing. ah it was so great..i love uc's campus and i just love the atmosphere and i really do wanna go there. and there was a plus too..i went to his classes with him..and we were in a class with nick williams...and the other class had eric hicks jihad and chadd moore. ah it was great. eric hicks is a goof. so yeah..that was so fun. and then we went back to his house and hung out until katie got off and then we went to eat at cici's and then back to my sister's dorm. we were so tired..we didnt feel like going anywhere. 
so yeah here i am today. saturday..we are going home sometime this afternoon then i have a game tonight...so many people are coming im nervous. and tonight...who knows. was supposed to do something with josh after he got off work..but you know how he is.

"event","Last week was a pretty good week.
Didn't volunteer on tuesday. Went out to eat after school on friday at frisches like always with nikki. then i hung out at nikkis house with her mom and kari while she went to a wedding with nicholas. then we went out to eat again at frisches that night when she got home. :) saturday was the uc game..yes i know they lost to louisville but it's early and they're still improving so its ok. i cant wait to go to UC and go to every home game. ah it'll be orgasmic :)
saturday night i had a game and we won..and the team we played was completely out of their minds..and it was pretty funny. and i had 5 points and a ton of rebounds and blocks. and i had such a big fan club there..lol
matt cory mom dad nikki and her mom all came to watch me. so i was pretty nervous but i played pretty darn good. and after the game me and kari and matt went back to corys house and had pizza. and then nikki and tommy and eric and nathan and delia came over. and it was a nice little party. then it was just cory me nikki kari eric tommy and matt and we all played pool. and it was fun with all them. 
i worked sunday 10 to 6.and i job shadowed a surgery nurse on monday all day..it was soo cool. i said a total hip surgery and a knee and gallbladder. ah it was sweet. but i dont know if i could do that everyday. i get to shadow a labor and delivery nurse next month so that should be interesting.
tuesday...yesterday i worked. and tonight i have bball practice from 8 to 9 and we're scrimmaging the little frosh again. ugh i hate this one girl..grr queer lol.
oh yeah...found out from steph today that josh texted her 2 weeks ago and asked about me..hm pretty confusing. 
well not too many plans for this weekend...but ill end up doing something! 
ill update again soon..

Girls are just plain dumb. Boys are even dumber. And I'm about to lose it with all these stupid people I have to deal with day in and day out. 
Found out some good news today...have a 91 in pre-cal! ah that's the highest grade I've had in there ever! every other class is looking pretty good. I'm surprised I'm doing so good. 
Got the list for intercessions today to choose from..I need a fine arts credit. I think i'm going to take greater cincy arts venues. who knows..
first basketball game in a long time on saturday...at 5 at gems. come watch me please. ladybugs freaking rock.

"event","Well..life's life. Back to school today...not too bad. Except that I found out one...actually two of my really good friends are DOUCHES! But hey..I know I have some true friends and I'm not too bothered by it. Yeah so I'm not too worried about them. Still got my buddies Nik Shan Brian and Zacariah..I know I can always count on them. No boys...no more boys ever! haha just playing...just no more boys for a long time for me. I really do need to focus on my schoolwork..my grades are slipping. And my volunteering and job shadowing and my job and basketball. I just have more important things in my life then immature low-life high school girls. So enough about that..
Ok I know you all know I am a huge UC fan..and I am most likely going there for college. And yes I know they lost to Illinois last week. But to those people who wanna make fun of me for it..FUCK YOU! They still kick ass and it's not embarassing to lose to the number one team in the country. Who were kentucky's and xavier's losses to...yeah that's what I thought. Not the number one team..teams that aren't even ranked. So HA! In your faces bitches. lol ok so I am going either the wake forest louisville or st louis game..whatever one brian gets tickets to. I'm excited...but I need someone to take with me so if you're interested and I like you then ask me about it and I might consider asking you. 
Hm..what else. New Year's eve was fun with nik at her house and there was a plus to it..her cousin is gorgeous and he stayed the night! ;) hehe im terrible
i had an awesome weekend..
hung out with cory sean matt robby and travis on saturday night..it was great. but it tears me apart to see sean and not be able to have him...grr. i love that kid. but anyways it was so fun to hang with them like old times.
and to make it even better...me sean robby and cory hung out again on sunday night. ah i love it. 
Well I think that's all i got for today..SO LEAVE ME ALONE ALL YOUR FUCKING DOUCHE BAGS!
haha just playing..i love you guys..my loyal fans. start a fan club. Lo Lovers :) thats catchy

true friends are there when things are the best and when things are the worst. no excuses..that's a true friend.

closing quote
I still don't know 
just what went wrong 
all that I know is 
one minute you were by my side, 
the next one, you were gone 
maybe you didn't mean to make me cry 
yet, then, maybe you did 
all I know is I still feel 
the million stabbing knives 

all I did was love you so much more 
than you will ever even know 
I loved you more than anyone's ever loved before 
and even though I love you still, 
I mustn't let it show 
I miss you very deeply 
and more-so every day 
it tears away at my heart and soul 
and leaves me bear and cold inside 

kinda depressing but i thought it was kinda appropiate

"event","Hm...once again it has been a long time since we've talked. I see a pattern forming.. :)
well let's get started..
last time i updated me and josh were together and generally happy..things have changed...DRASTICALLY!
well on november 10 i went out with the girls..nikki deanna stephanie sarah and kari to eat at outback then back to nikkis to spend the night because we were off school on thursday. Me and josh's 2 month was on that thursday the 11..he picked me up at like 11.30 in the morning and we went out to eat at larosas...then back to his house. his ex kept calling with me there and he talked to her in front of me for like 15 minutes..i found a note from her on his desk and my pic was gone from his room. the note pretty much opened up all these lies that he has fed to me..he talks to her all the time..cheats on me..still cares about her..FUCKING LIAR! ah it makes me so angry :) so yeah that friday night we were supposed to hang out because he left for bootcamp the next morning and i wouldnt see him all weekend..so i go up to his work at 8 to make sure we are and he says he doesnt know..he'll call me. never calls. i call him around 1045 and he answers and i hear someone in the background yell you dont have to tell that bitch anything hang up the phone josh. so he goes lauren stop calling me. i have a girlfriend. well i about blew up right there. seriously...ive never seen myself go so crazy before. he hangs up and i call and leave 9 voice messages about 4 minutes long each...telling him how much he disgusts me and how bad of a person he is...basically dogging him and his little whore. so yeah that ended us. and i really havent talked to him since...im so proud of myself. i finally did something for myself. and i am so happy i am not with him anymore. im so much better than that. really. hes trash and we would have never worked...with him in the marines and all. he was one of my rings that he had been wearing and he got it ""taken away"" at school..thats prolly bull. but hes supposed to text me when he gets it back..which will prolly be never. im giving his stuff to amvets..haha sucks for him. my mom took them and was like he doesnt deserve these back! haha go mom!
so yeah...that was a pretty tough time cuz i did care about the kid a lot and i was very attached. it'll be hard to move on but i can do it..i got friends and family to be happy about and im much to busy nowadays for a boy so demanding as him anyways. 
went to operation zero the next wednesday
went to the football game at princeton..they lost but oh well it was fun. and i spent the night at amandas on that saturday. Last thursday was thanksgiving..it was fun. got a lot of shopping done with nikki on friday..at 8 in the morning! haha it was so fun..but very crowded. good to hang out with my bro and sis over break. cant wait til christmas time though. 
welp i work tonight, volunteer tomorow night, and work on friday night.
so i will write again when i get the chance

"event","Dude...definantly haven't been here in a long time. Sorry kids! So much stress and things going on..let's start from the last time I updated..october 12..
October 14 was my parent's anniversary and i had this awards ceremony thingy for having a cumulative 3.75 gpa all through high school so far. The 15th was the homecoming game..went with steph cuz josh was working. we had a blast..even though it was 20 degrees the whole time! Saturday the 16th..had st veronica directory pictures at 12.30. they were cute..we got to look at them on the computer after they took them. then i got my hair done for homecoming at 2..then makeup at 4 and josh got to my house at about 5. he brought me a dozen roses for sweetest day. :) and he said i was beautiful and we looked adorable together..i had a black dress with a white stripe on top..strapless..really elegant. and he was wearing all black with a white tie. it looked so good on him. well homecoming started off good..then went downhill from there. but i don't feel like going into it right now..just things got ugly and he ended up leaving early. I stayed the night at nikki's afterwards then worked the next day. The week of the 18th up until halloween was crazy at work..so many people and crap. worked the 19 21 and the 23. Monday the 25 josh broke up with me at school..went back to his ex..had to clear his head. Barely talked to him all that week..about drove myself crazy thinking about him though. friday he picked me up and we dropped off his friend..drove to ault park..with the prettiest views ever. he asked me if i had ever been there and i said no..and he said good i want this to be special and i want your first time here to be with me. it was gorgeous..and it felt perfect. then we went to his mom's work..back to his house..then out to eat with his mom, his mom's best friend sharon..and another friend. we went to brio's..a really expensive italian restaurant. me and josh walked around by ourselves and looked at the river and at dinner when we were sitting together outside cuz inside the restaurant was packed..we were eating the appetizers and his mom looked at us and was like you guys look adorable together..it's perfect. when you guys eat it's like coordinated...you guys eat and chew together..we started to laugh and looked at each other and just smiled..because we both knew it was true. after dinner we got icecream then went back to his house and hung out for the night..and as stephanie would say..IT GOT ALL OVER!!!!! hahhaha don't ask.. :) so yeah..i took josh back. i just can't help myself..he's done some pretty crappy things but i still care about him so much. i worked on the saturday after til 6 and josh came over after and we rented a movie..the punisher and just hung out in my room. worked on sunday morning at 7! yeah..7 in the freaking morning..sunday morning! ah..it was crazy..but i got off at 1.30 so it was all good. got to pass out candy at my house..had about 40 trick or treaters though..there was barely anyone! and here we are today..tuesday the 2..election day. oh yeah..got in big trouble yesterday..went out with josh and lied to mom about it..told her going out with friends because im dumb. and she caught me..and im in trouble. lol don't know how much yet..but we're talking tonight. i just hope i will be able to see josh this weekend. i miss the kid..used to see him all the time. but it will all work out in the end..i know it will. that's gonna be my motto..
no matter how bad it gets..it will all be ok in the end.
well i work this week on wednesday and saturday..don't really have any other plans.

wipes away the rain with a hundred summer skies
and every time i talk to you its like im alright
and everytime i talk to you i get a little closer to the light

you are the face
that heaven showed me
when i needed someone
someone to love
and say you show me
the quiet kind of love behind 
your face

I'll start with last friday..since thats all i can remember. lol
Me and steph and nikki all went up to emily's work cuz we were gonna eat and pick her up and go back to stephs to hang out. so we got hungry early (we're young and growing girls! we need our food! lol) so we go up there to eat at like 730 or 8..and this one kid named josh keeps talking to us. so emily tells me to flirt with him and say really stupid stuff to him. so he walks by carrying something...and im like you looked pretty strong carrying that. HAHA! he thought i was crazy..so we were getting ready to leave and up by the greeting table and cash register...and emilys like ""josh give lauren you're number"". so he writes it down and i take it. and call him later on that night. and we totally hit it off. Oh yeah...and i still like brandon at this point. so on saturday i work all day til 9 and just go home and talk to josh all night. then on sunday my parents left to go move my bro into his college..i miss him! and josh is like well since you have nothing to do all day..ill come over before i work at 5. so he comes over for a little bit. and ah hes so hott! lol and then that night..nikki picks me up and we go up to larosas to visit josh at work. and see emily alicia and sarah there working. then we leave to go back to nikkis to get the party started! lol lets name everyone that came...but first josh was supposed to come but he couldnt..he went to his dads cuz he never sees him. ok now everyone who went..

"event","alright..well the past 4 days or so have been crazy. let's update..
first to start..tuesday of last week.
i went to the pool with sam. we hung out with jayson vincent the like whole time we were there. it was so fun. then that night tommy came over at like 1030 and we hung out at my house til like 1200. 
then wednesday i went over to emily's house with stephanie to work on summer homework. well you know how three girls are working on homework together..we got absolutely nothing done! but i did get spark notes from em about cold mountain..which helps a lot!  and it was also good cuz stephanie got to meet emily and get acquianted and stuff. and then that night i went to sam's youth group at her church and then we went shopping and i got a pair of jeans and a shirt. 
then thursday i went to the pool with sam and have a funny story with that. well we snuck me in because i didnt wanna pay. and at first the kid asked me if i had a pass and i was like yeah. then we went out to get lunch and bring it into the pool and he tells us we cant. then we come back in from eating and he asks my name and i tell him markovic. and he looks it up and asks if im rachel..sam's sister. i say yeah then he looks at me and goes "" you dont look like youre 12."" and me and sam started laughing. well we didnt have any money and they little douchebag made us pay anyways. we had to go out to the car and pay in quarters. ugh that kid made me so angry! then on thursday night i went over to steph's house with tommy. we went swimming and hung out there. tommy and me were flirting a lot that night..it was kinda good kinda bad. and i gave him a kiss on the cheek. :) nothing big cuz were just like best friends!
then on friday i went out to lunch with my bro sis and mom cuz it was my sis's last day at home before she moved back. i got chicken quesadillas from max n ermas. they were sooo good. that night i went shopping with my mom for school clothes. and i found my homecoming dress! its so pretty! i bought it now cuz its only 80 dollars. its strapless and its black and kinda poofs at the bottom..then right above my chest there is a strip of white. its really simple but its so gorgeous! now all i have to do is get a guy to go to homecoming with! i also got a jean skirt and a shirt and new white shoes when i  went shopping. 
then yesterday..saturday..i worked from 9 to 5. i did balloons all day so i was so excited! it went by so fast! after work i went and got my hair cut..so cute but kinda weird looking. just like 2 and a half inches off. then i went to emilys birthday party. it was fun. i went with steph and it was good that she met some more people. i also got to kiss nick pittsley on the cheek..TWICE! haha it was funny..hes like my brother. in a weird and twisted kind of way. 
then today i went to church cuz i havent been in like a month. and they had the dedication for all the new stuff there..gym and classrooms and everything. got to see old teachers..mrs mcnerney mrs williams. it was nice. then i left at like 130 to go with sam canoeing. we went with her fam and it was on the little miami. it was sooo fun! we sucked at first! we were like going backwards and sideways and didnt know how to steer or anything. we sucked! then we learned how to do it..and at the end there was a bunch of rocks in really shallow water..well there were tons of rocks in shallow water all over but it wasnt as bad..and we went over one and got stuck on it! and we were like pushing off and we were just spinning around! and the worst part was that her family and the other people we were with were just rowing away laughing at us and not even helping! so we were stuck there for about 5 mintues..before we finally got loose and got stuck on another one! ah it was terrible! but it was so much fun! then we went to mcdonalds for dinner and then i came home and took a shower and here i am now! lol long past few days. i work on tuesday and wednesday and start school on thursday! ah! im so excited! and the first football game is on friday! cant wait for that either.. got so much stuff im looking forward to!

Went to bed around 1 on saturday night. woke up around 5 feeling like shit. laid in bed til around 630 and then went into the bathroom and sat on the floor til like 730. then my mom came in and asked what was wrong and i said i felt like shit and i was gonna throw up. so she said i might have indigestion from a piece of pie i had at perkins with tommy earlier that night. so i took 3 drinks of alka seltzer..that is the sickest thing i've ever tasted. it made me throw up. but i think i was gonna throw up anyways. and i continued to throw up..lol it was bad and i felt like crap! i stayed in bed all day! so yeah that pretty much sucked! on saturday i worked from 9 to 5 then babysat from 6 til 10. tommy came over and hung out with me. it was fun. and then he came and picked me up and we went out to perkins. then came back to my house and hung out. i feel so much better today though. and im eating so much! lol got work tonight from 5 to 9. not doing anything else exciting! welp ttyl!"

There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known.
I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done.
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do.
I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.

An' I'm lettin' go of all my lonely yesterdays.
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made.
Now there's just one thing, the only thing I wanna do, mmm, mmm.
I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.

Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine, 
Shinin' down on me and you.
When you put your arms around me,
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do.

I used to run in circles goin' no-where fast.
I'd take, one step forward and two steps back.
Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to, 
I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.

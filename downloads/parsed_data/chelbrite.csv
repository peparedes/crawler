"event","today is january 21. 
today is joe curry's birthday.
joe lives in texas, so i don't get to see joe anymore.
a couple things you should know about this not so average joe:
he can always make me laugh about anything. he is easily the funniest guy i know. 
he's loveable like a teddy bear. i mean have you ever met someone that didn't love joe?
he's caring and sweet, he makes the best presents ever.
joe is the defination of good time. 
he has strong opinions and reasons to back them up.
most importantly, he's irreplacable.
there will always be a spot in my heart for this little joe bear.
i love my baby gurl joe. i hope you have a great birthday/year/life/hahaha.

i remember this one time. joe and i dressed up like prostitutes and shot up in a dirty alley. then we drank fortys and broke bottles all night long. i don't remember much from that night but i know we woke up on a playground and watched the sun-rise. we swang on swings until his mom picked us up and took us to get our haircut. man that was the day joe got his mohawk, that was also the day he contracted aids from a dirty needle. i'll never forget that day and i'm sure he never will either. good times.

"event","today, december 14th is amanda's 19th birthday, for that, this entry is dedicated to her.
sentiments:
Another year has gone by, more boys and tears and fights (never between us).. It seems weird to say that we've been best friends since we were 12. We've crossed so many bridges together, our most recent college and moving out. I wouldn't have it any other way. I wouldn't change any aspect of our friendship. You mean more to me than any other person in this world and I would sarcafice anything to make you happy. I would drop anything and everything to help you out or be by your side and you best believe i would raise hell on your behalf. you are my perfect friend, no one else could ever wish to take your place or be half the friend you are to me. I don't know where we will be next year at this time, i'd like to think we will still be hanging out, regardless of where we are, i will love you more than i love you today.

It all began in 6th: i don't remember the exact day i met amanda. i do remember the goldfish at lunchtime, and sitting with emil and aaron. i remember created a stupid language so we could say they were stupid and weird. they watched our friendship begin. it's weird to think they had no idea what they were watching.

things i love about AMANDA:
*she laughs that i steal her pens and pencils.
*she grades my papers
*she wakes up at 5:20 in the morning to watch the sunrise with me.
*she puts up with my grumpy moods and tears.
*she always puts a smile on my face.
*she makes the best faces, like winks, etc.
*she can make me laugh under the most dire conditions.
*she puts her arm around me shoulders and helps me walk when i feel like it's too hard.
*she accompanies me on missions or errands.
*she understands me without saying a word.
*she goes along with every joke without missing a beat.
*i can predict when she will laugh. i always want to show her things to see her laugh.
*her laugh is contagious. 
*she carefully picks the things she stands up for.
*she still surprises me.
*she wakes me up in the middle of night so i can study.
*she has the best sense of humor.
*she's sensitive and caring.
*she can get along with anyone.
*she's as tough as they come.
*she lies and gets children's admission.
*she's a fat enabler.
*she knows how to shake her butt.
*she doesn't cave to peer pressure.
*she likes my pictures, even though they are shit.
i could go on forever.

Love,
Big Bro Rachie B"

<big><b>could you steal a purse from this face?</big></b>



so this morning i woke up and crystal says to me have u seen my purse?.. i replied i didn't even know you had a purse. then like an hour later amanda busted into my room and said CRYSTAL'S PURSE WAS STOLEN. -a reason to skip class - we skipped class to hang out with her and file the police report. poor crystal. i didn't even know she had a purse.. i wonder if things go missing that we don't even pay attention to.. like we only noticed beth's laptop, my books, and crystals purse.. but maybe more things have gone missing.. like today i couldn't find the ketchup.. no, that was in amanda's room. then last week.. i couldn't find this pot.. no, that was in amanda's room.. maybe all the lost stuff has been eaten by amanda's room.....

"event","today is kissifers birthday!
i <3 my big brother.
he crank called me last night, i think he was drunk.. but i'm glad he thought of me and i'm glad it wasn't mean.
i hope he is doing well. i hope now that neither of us live at home, we can grow together rather than apart. i hope that this year is better than his last. i love his charming face, it shines bright. 
Happy 21 Chris. now if we ever go to the beach again the bars won't turn you down and piss u off.

Love,
Rachel"

"event","in english, we are writing a paper analysing a magazine ad. yesterday, this guy in my class brought in an ad of a picture of a cigarette in a glass ashtray with smoke all over the place. he went on and on about how smoking is bad and disgusting. today, on my way skipping sociology, i saw him smoking a cigarette outside talking to some girl in the shade.

?!?

"event","quick to the point:
back in action.
amanda and i moved into our apartment. only one of our roommates showed up. her name is beth. she is nice. she use to fight forest fires, seriously. she got food poisoning.. or so we thought. apparently she had a virus. we got the virus from her. so for about 36ish hours we were puking and crawling around the apartment moaning. <-- aka the first to second day of school. it was gross... our boys were very sweet to us.

i have been laughing alot.

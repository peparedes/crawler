So who wants to update me on the state of the war? I need Tifa back! She helps me do my chem homework! How do we defeat evil Michael and his nefarious schemes?"

"event","I finally got a muse! (pulls Tifa onstage) Tifa, say hi to all the LiveJournal people!

Tifa: Hi, LiveJournal people. (turns to Desdemona) Did you say Rude and Reno have a private bar in TifaG's lj?

Desdemona: Um...maybe...

Tifa: Great, I'm there. (heads for the door)

Desdemona: (puzzled) Since when does my lj have a door?"

"event","Well, it's been awhile since I've used this journal, since my nonfanfic stuff goes in my regular journal, fallengoddess. Figured I'd post here, though, to welcome Lila (a little belatedly, cause I'm a bum) and to say hi to Kiyara, who I discovered on lj through top secret undercover mission-type things. It helps that her lj name is also Kiyara, though. Made the top-secret work easier.

Anyway. I still haven't finished ANYTHING lately--except that chapter of What Dreams May Come about a month back--because I'm really awful about starting stories and never finishing them. Currently my hopes are to finish the songfic I started in September (heh heh...oops...) and a Vincent fic I wrote half of in chem once. There's also part 2 of ""The Making of FFVII"" on hold for the moment, and chapter 15 of WDMC. I blame my laziness and unfinished work on my lack of a muse.

In other news, I received my first flame! Ahem...""screw you tifa loves cloud"", left by a person named ""yo"" in my story Waking Up. I'm so proud--it might not be a very good flame, or a very literate flame, or even a very vindictive flame but it's MINE! ::huggles flame::"

"event","So here I am, stuck in school on a perfectly beautiful day. Ohwell. At least I'm in computer science...being in chem or math would suck even more.

I'm so very sad. I'm nearly done with ""The Weakness in Me,"" and ff.net is being all stupid and nonexistant. Figures...the one time I was motivated enough to finish the writing I started. Well I say FSTARCK to ff.net. Fstarck indeed.

Hehehe. I just read on someone's webpage that his lifelong goal is to add the word quorbit to the English language. Mayhap I shall use it in everyday speech."

The truth is, though, if guys weren't so confusing, I wouldn't have anything to write angsty poetry about."

"event","So I decided to start a new LJ dedicated to my writing, since ff.net has been cutting down drastically on the fun and useful stuff, such as forums (damn the webmasters to a farflung hell.)

I'm currently working on chapter 13 of What Dreams May Come, but have been suffering from severe writers' block for awhile now. Hopefully I'll wrap the chapter up within the week.

Also, I'm working on a songfic based on the song The Weakness in Me, by Joan Armatrading. It's a Tifa/Reno (because I love them both ohsomuch) and based very firmly on some shit I'm plowing through right now. Therefore, the date of release and the ending will both be directly related to the outcome of my current situation. Watch for it, though, as it should turn out pretty good."

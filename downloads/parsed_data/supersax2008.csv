"event","SCHOOL IS OUT!  WOOOOOOO HOOOOOOO   Im so happy that there is no school for three months.  Its pretty cool, but i need a break.  I have met so many new people there.  Nobody really understands all the changes that i went through this year because of WHS nor do they understand how meaningful some of the experiences i have had are to me.  I am so glad to have all of you with me.  Idk what i would do without all of my friends to back me up when i was down and what i would do without people in general to make life interesting.  I'm gonna be pretty busy this summer, so let me know whats goin on whenever you can so we can hang out.  Hope everyone has a great summer.  Quote: Claire- You know what I just realized?  We have no homework tonight!!........wow.............GREAT OBSERVATION"

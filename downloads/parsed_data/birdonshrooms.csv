"event","Well I am in Florida Right now, I know i havent updated since i first got this journal but i plan on trying to update as much as i can now, Me and Chris have to leave this piece at like 2 in the morning for the orlando airport our plane leaves at 5:50 so that sucks.  I need weed now i havent had it in my system for like 6 days which is very unusual for me. oh well probably good for me though.  Im ready to go home and smoke a bowl though, i actually miss bloomington, i really dont know why but i do, funny. I wish I had some speed or something i am tired and no point to sleep till i get home.  It sucks because I kind of got a little tan.  But it is uneven, my left arm is still white and my right arm is tan maybe im half one pigment and half another. That would be cool.   Fuck i am bored its raining outside otherwise i would be out on the dock or trying to catch these lizards that are every where in Florida there like fucking insects here weird.  I have had a great time but ready to get home.

"event","Well I found out what skee skee skee is from Mike the other day! So atleast I can say I have learned something at school this week.  So now that I know what it is I have been singing that alot and letting everybody I come in contact with know what it is too. For any reader who arent familiar with skee skee it is when a guy blows his load, (ejaculates). Interesting huh, I wonder if the rapper knew that?
Anyways its early and I am ready to have my morning smoke with Chris, Logan, and Chris R. We are meeting somewhere!"

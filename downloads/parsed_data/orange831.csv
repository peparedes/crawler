"event","...I wanna go to the Anime Expo 2005!!! O_O I just went to the website for AX 2004 and read everything about it: all the events, contests, special guests, and even the rules and regulations. Everything seems so fun! Although Otakon had better guests like L'ARC EN CIEL!! Too bad it was all the way in Maryland and it already happened.. T3T I've never been to a convention or cosplayed before in my life and it always sounds so much fun when I hear/read about it from people that had experienced it. So I think I'm gonna go to AX 2005. It's supposedly in Anaheim.. it's not that far away.. only 6 hours of driving. Gotta make my costume! I have 7-8 months to prepare! >:) But it's no guarantee I'm gonna make it for sure.

But in other news, I created my very first CG yesterday! It was the title page for TWTYH doujinshi contest. I have a little more than 1 1/2 months left to get it done. I'm planning to get it done by Christmas since it's Christmas theme and all.. ~_~ well there's ONE spoiler!! >) I'm currently plotting the story or... at least trying to. ^_^; Earlier today, I was just sitting at my computer trying to think up a story for this contest and I got something! It was a pretty good beginning too but I decided that it's not really Christmas themed so I decided to use the story for another doujinshi I might do for Emi in summer of 2005 (AX 2005!!!) just for kicks. If I have time. Can't make any promises.. I'm not that good at keeping schedule.

C'mon muse... INSPIRE ME!!!"

"event","I finally got started on TWTYH holiday doujinshi contest.. I only got started on the cover of it though. -_- I haven't drawn anything in such a long time because I haven't been getting any inspirations, but now that I'm entering a contest, I've got something to motivate me. It's good to be able to draw again. ^_^ I'm also thinking about entering the Rising Stars of Manga contest... I've been wanting to ever since I first learned about it from Percy/Rem's website... but I never got to it. ^_^; I've been trying to come up with a story since last month but no luck.. I want something different... something.. out of the box.. a plot-twister... ........... Oh well. It'll come to me sooner or later! ^_^;

I watched Tokyo Godfathers two days ago. It's pretty awesome! It's funny, weird, and touching at the same time... o_o Speaking of weird.. I watched Excel Saga yesterday for the first time....... I didn't really understand it but then again, I don't think I was supposed to. ^_^;

Well, I can't think of anything else to say at the moment.. so I'm just gonna go work on the cover some more and maybe even attempt to spruce up my livejournal a little! >_<"

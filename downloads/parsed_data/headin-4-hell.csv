WOO!
WOO!
WOO!
BREATHE!

[Bridge]
One and then the two 
Two and then the three 
Three and then the four 
Then you gotta BREATHE 
One and then the two 
Two and then the three 
Three and then the four 
Then you gotta BREATHE 
Then you gotta (gasp)
Then you gotta (gasp)

[Hook I]
Yo these niggaz can't breathe when I come through, hum too 
Some shoes, gotta be 20 man 
It's not even funny they can't BREATHE 
The choke holds too tight 
The left looks too right 
You know what? You right 
These bitches can't BREATHE 

[Hook II]
Look look, they hearts racin'
They start chasin'
But I'm so fast when I blow past
That they can't BREATHE 
In the presence of the man 
Your future looks better than ya past if you present with the man 
You betta BREATHE 

You niggaz can't share my air 
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear 
And I'm gettin better year by year 
Like they say Juan do 
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through 
And I pace myself 
I know these money hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth 
But I keep em' on a diet 
Embrace they health 
Or either keep em' on a quiet 
And space myself 
And just take a deep breath 
I got em' grabbin' they chest 
Cuz it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best 
And they in they worst 
They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back
And I ain't just layin a verse 
I'm sayin the facts 
I came back with some sicka stones 
That got these broke niggaz lookin at me like they chokin' on a chicken bone 
Every chick I bone 
Can't leave the dick alone 
So I know 
It's one of them everytime I flip my phone 

[BRIDGE] 

[HOOK I]

[HOOK II]

I see em on the block when I passes 
Lookin like they need oxygen mask-es 
I make it hard to BREATHE 
But I keep the glocks in the stashes 
Cuz the cops wanna lock and harass us 
And make it hard to BREATHE 
They has to react 
Like havin' a asthma attack 
When they see the plasma in back 
You dudes are wheezin' behind me 
My flow is like a coupe, breezin at 90 
That's the reason they signed me 
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts 
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut 
How I address the haters and under estimaters 
And ride up on them like they escalators 
They shook up and hooked up to respirators 
On they last breath talking to investigators 
I'm a breath of fresh air 
And a fresh pair 
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue 
And then BREATHE 

[BRIDGE] 

[HOOK I]

[HOOK II]

When the crew walk in it 
Pop a few corks in it 
As quick as a tick in a New York minute 
Catch a breath, fore u catch a left 
Even worse, catch a Tef 
Only way u catch a F 
To the A-B, its in the maybe 
Rollin with my baby 
Grippin on a toy that you won't find in +KayBee+ 
I rhyme slick on ya 
I'm a have to put the Heimlich on ya 
What you know bout lettin' dimes lick on ya?
While you inhale the weed 
And it won't stop till they inhale ya seed
And it don't stop I tell em' to breathe 
Like a doctor with a stethoscope 
I don't see no fuckin hope 
Unless these motherfuckers BREATHE 

Yeah, Brooklyn gotta
Uptown gotta
the Bronx gotta
Queens gotta
Staten Isle gotta
You niggas gotta
You bitches gotta
Everybody BREATHE 

One and then the two 
Two and then the three 
Three and then the four 
Then you gotta.. BREATHE
Then you gotta.. 
Then you gotta.. 
BREATHE
Oh* BREATHE
BREATHE 
Oh* BREATHE
BREATHE
BREATHE
Oh* BREATHE
BREATHE"

Yeah, this somethin special y'know, somethin epic
Lloyd Banks, you know
Cause a nigga thuggin don't mean he don't
Don't wanna see you smile baby

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Wooo! I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smi-ile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
I'm gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge
From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz
It all depends, maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact
So everytime we seperate, somebody's marchin back
You're amazing in the sack
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black
God Bless whoever gave you alla that
If you seen her from the back
You'd understand why dis feel like that
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes
Up and down

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks + (50 Cent)]
Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be (I be the reason you smile)
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be (I be the reason you smile)
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be (I be the reason you smile)
We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be (I be the reason you smile)

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful
What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tip toed into a crib or two
I've come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggaz
when you tease 'em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left
Wild drama, section 8 princess
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed
Cause it's hard to communicate
Cause she don't speak-a no english
I been around the world from state to state
But now I'm back bustin in your bathroom
Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on
Cause I'm leavin in a hour, fly-through, don't matter she's mad
Even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And, I bet you I can make you smile

[Chorus - 2X]"

[Chorus: Eminem] 
How come we dont even talk no more
And you dont even call no more
We dont barely keep in touch at all
And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now
After all the years we been down
Aint no way no how, this bullshit can be true
We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So young, so full of life in vibrant side by side wherever you weres ridin i went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When ronnie died you weres right by my side with a sholder to cry on
Tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood i did
Sometimes i just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours
And mine i survived it, you ran the streets, i 9 to 5'd it
We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then i blew up
To both yours and mine surprises
Now i feel the vibe i just cant describe it
As much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold, you touch its like ice
In your eyes is the look of resenment
I can sense it, and i dont like it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]

It was my dream at first to be on spittin a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got burst
So i came out i woulda killed a nigga first
Before i let him disrespect me and check me over some worste
Some bitch that i wasnt with i would hit her then quit
But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you dont get involved in it, you was smokin the chron with her
Comin out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk
Like yall was husband and wife or somethin
But me catchin you fuckin other niggers musta hurt you pride or somethin
Cuz you wont fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me
When all i tried to do was show your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced
You actin like i aint you man and lyin like she can't be loose
But i am really you friend, i'm jus trying to tell you the truth
But dont hate the game or the player
Cuz the one that is changing is you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Proof]

You're only at the top cuz my homie had to stop
Now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
Homies in the hood only she be on the tube
Only gossip on the porch get to speakin on who
Fools i used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin and *poof* it jus happen
But PROOF is jus actin out the party was stoned
Shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home
See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends
Whenever real intelligence thats forever till the end
I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives
And wastin my times with these snakes in disguise
(how come) when you talk its with bitter is fight
And (how come) it's my fault for what you did with your life
And everytime i go to hear you and play you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.

I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

[Eminem]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people
And 5 I hit
Ah shit
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed I meant coke dumb ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bomb and's dashing town
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out

[Kon Artist & Kuniva]
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von
You see me stepping on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid cuz the X is gone
Ya I took them all dog with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone
It's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cumm
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on
So stop acting stupid
You so high
That you might wake up with a guy
On some new shit
I think I did too much
This substance equals cups
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills (That's ill)
Mescaline

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Dirty Dozen
80 of us
Shady brothers
Ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some-, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something

[Proof]
Pop pills
Pills I pop
Pop two pills
On stilts I walk
Snorted two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was Incredible I killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away
Like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Look for coke to smoke
I overdose 
When I pack up my nose with coke
*cough cough cough*
Am I supposed to choke
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby
Born by whore lady
And I'm gonna strangle a - (You're crazy!)

[Swifty]
I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
(You got any shroom?)
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get job
Because our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack
Then I might too
(Swift, chill)
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue
Speed, shrooms, down the valiums
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just got some and I'm going back soon

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
I'm at rave
Looking like a slave
High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid-dropping, dope heavy guy
Heroine mescaline pencilneck, wanna try 
Blue pills, golden seals
Got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill (Yeah, right)
Bitch I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt
Let Bizarre nutt

'Cause so are you. We've broke our mirrors. 
Sunday morning. Is everyday for all I care. 
And I'm not scared. Light my candlrs. 
In a daze cause I've found god. 

Yeah (x bunch times) 

(Chorus).."

I guess I owe most of it to Simone, because if it weren't for her he would have never asked me out.  

But it's awesome because I like him and he likes me, and I liked him before I knew that he liked me, which is good.

You are prolly all wondering who I'm talking about, besides Cata because she already knows.

It's...Will!!!  Yay!

Well I'll write more some other time.

"event","Wow, I haven't writen in a loooooong time.  Most of my entries in here are stupid, immature, and childish anyway, so what's the point?  Oh well.  This year  I will be better.

Mkay, School year so far:

1st period: Media Arts~Mr. Gilley~ Totally awesome class!  Definently my favorite, especially because I'm the anchor on the Morning Show and because it's a film making class and I love acting.

2nd period: Science~Mr. Wieland~It's ok, Mr. Wieland is really easy and doesen't give homework unless it's absoulutly necessary.  We're also doing a bunch of labs.

3rd period: Algebra 1~Ms. Abrams~It's not great, some of the stuff we do is sorta fun but I hate Abrams she's so evil!

4th period: Lunch~Yay! lunch is my favorite class, besides Media Arts.

5th period: Tech Ed~Mr. Gilley~It's pretty fun, Sim City was really hard, I only got like 3,000 people instead of 20,000 which is what we were supposed to get, but there were only 3 out of like 10 people that actually got 20,000, so oh well.  Plus I can still get 100/200 pts for the actuall city, and I'll get prolly 100 on the worksheet, test, and clean-up so I can still get 400/500 pts.  which he said was like an A- but i think it's actually a B-, i think, it's 80% for anyone who knows what grade 80% would be.

6th period: English LA~Ms. Barker~It's a pretty cool class, lots of reading which I like, and the writing we're doing is fun so it's all good.  Except I sit by A.J.

7th and 8th period: Spanish LA/Social Studies~Ms. Barker~It's ok, I did really bad on the vocab test though, it dropped my grade to a B.  I again have to sit by A. J.  I'm also sitting by Collin V but he's nice.  A. J. would be nice, except he's always being obnoxious, like pushing my stuff off the desk and closing my book when i'm trying to work. It's really annoying.

Dance: Cami~I'm on elite this year and it's pretty fun except Cami is working us really hard with these break-dancing moves.

Soccer: Kiko~I hate soccer this year, my coach hates me because I'm not a fast runner, he's always saying run at your own pace, but when I do and i DON'T stop to walk he gets mad at me for being slow.  Then at practice he says stuff like, ""you girls are doing great, you're running more than any other team and even Colleen is running a lot.""  I run more than anyone on that team because he's always making me do extra laps because Geneva and I get bored standing in line for half an hour and start talking or dancing or something. Grr...this is the first year I haven't liked soccer since kindergarden.

Dancing School: So fun when you stand by your friends!  We can laugh and talk about the guys we danced with and stuff, and then going places afterward is soooo awesome!  My dress is the best dress ever, especially since i desingned it my self. I picked out the pattern and the fabric and stuff and then my G-ma sewed it together, usually I give her most of the credit.  

Overall the year is fine except for A. J. and Kiko and sometime the stuff Cami makes us do.

Well I have to go talk to Kevin now, so see you all later.

Today is a calm day, I haven't been thinking about boys today, which is weird, but it also means that my mind is calm and blank.

Two days ago i went shopping with Cata and I bought two tee-shirts at Rave, love that store!

Yesterday I helped clean a house and went to Red Robin and a pottery painting place to paint pottery for my friend's birthday present.

Today i'm just calm.

Because you're great and we have lots of fun times together, but it seems like our friendship never was fully repaired after the whole song thing.

OMG! the mac dance was soooooo fun!!!  It was dfinintly the best out of the 3 i went to!  They played everything I requested and the other music was totally kickass!




Hoop Dance:

The hoop dance was also super fun!  It would have been more fun if more people i knew were there, and if Jill and Katie hadn't been there.   These bitchs asked us to have a dance contest w/ them, so we went, and they beat us by finding 50 different ways to shake their pathetic little asses.
Also this one kinda ugly 7th or 8th grader asked me to freak dance w/ him but i said no.  And my friend got asked to dance by to 7th or 8th graders, but she said no too.

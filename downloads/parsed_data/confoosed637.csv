"event","if i ever do post on this god foreshaken thing again here is a disclamer:

you will end up hating me- dont save my journel in your community, it is better for your health that you never read anything i have to say. you will end up hating me for things i say which is fine because odds are that i hate you even more
nothing i say is seriouse-i am a sarcastic person, if you cant deal with it dont read what i dont have to say. this page was set up as a joke so i am entitled to not be seriouse.
if you get offended -just stop reading now and go away, please. by the way if you get offened it is probally becasue you are not smart enougth to comprehend my sarcasm or interpte the meaning behind what i say
dont critize me in anyway- i am aware that i cant spell to save my life but if you like your life dont critize my spelling or i just might kill you. you can say anything else like what a horrible mean person i am and that i am going to hell
i think this is all for now so in parting i would like to tell all of you to fuck off- seriousely"

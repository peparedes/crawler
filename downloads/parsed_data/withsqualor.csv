"event","the new job is going well so far.  i picked up my tasks much more quickly than they expected me to.  hopefully things will continue along at this pace.  everyone's very nice and i'm slowly working my way into the social circle.  we have drinks on thursday--the first work social event since i started.  should be interesting--everyone's true colors come out over a couple beers.  i'd really like to get to know more of my coworkers, as the guy i work directly with is turning out to be kind of lame in an ""i love sports and don't know about british spelling or anything going on in the world other than sports"" kind of way.  at times it's just...dumbfounding?  he is very nice and good to chat with throughout the day but some of the things that come out of his mouth are just way off.  i'm scared i will end up punching him (or switching around all the keys on his keyboard--he pecks at the keys).  it's been one month and i can feel the frustration beginning.

october passed by way too quickly.  already, all of my november and about half of my december is planned out (this includes thanksgiving eve drinking, ms. liz, you are penciled in!).  it's kind of good this way, it keeps my mind from wandering and keeps me from getting into too much trouble, like going on dates with guys i don't like.  but i haven't done it!  all i've got these days in the way of romance is some residual bitterness and a few pipe dreams that will never be realized.  ah well not everyone will fall madly in love with you.  better to learn that sooner than later.  yeah, still working on that one.

i also was almost run over by a cab this evening.  and i could have sworn i was followed most of the way home from the subway by a creepy man in a leather jacket.  i formulated my plan of escape until i noticed he had turned--and then formulated an alternate plan in case he took another route and met me on my front stoop and i couldn't run to a public place because he already knew where i lived (also, in my mind he was a very fast runner and would catch me before i could get to the corner store).  new york can really make you crazy(er than you usually are)."

"event","it's funny...there are so many different facets to my life...friends, family, school, life, etc...and when one guy acts like a jerk, it makes me question my worth as a whole.  i wish it didn't.  but it does.

last weekend i saw mclovin for an hour, after which he promised he would keep thursday open and we would get together.  but when i asked him about it today, he said that he never promised, and that we only had tentative plans, and now he was busy with a work dinner.

i'm not the type of girl to make things up or put words in peoples' mouths.  i didn't imagine this, but he was angry that i did.  we were supposed to meet up after his dinner, but of course it ran late.  i understand that he had a promotion and is now a lot busier, but if you promise, come through or at least let me know in advance that you don't plan on honoring your intentions.  i'm busy too.  i don't have time for bullshit.

so after a night of yankees and dinner and drinks with a few of my girls, i was good but starting to feel pretty down again when it was time to go home.  i guess just because i show consideration for others, it doesn't mean they will do the same for me.  i don't know when i will see him again, and at this point, i don't really want to.  i can't say i don't care--i do.  but at this time, i need to walk away.  it's too bad, because things were going so well before his promotion.  i don't know if it's an excuse or a true reason for his behavior the past few weeks, but either way, i don't like it.  i work full time, and go to school on top of that, but i'm always willing to try and set aside time for him once a week.  i guess it was asking too much that he'd do the same.

when i was on the bus home, i was starting to feel my worst.  then this obviously wasted guy got on the bus, and we got to talking.  we smiled, we laughed, and for fifteen blocks i felt ok.  it was good to know that at least one person in this city was glad to meet me.  you'd think with so many people, things would be great.  but out of the places i've lived, this is truly the loneliest.  sometimes i wish i was ready to leave.  but i'm convinced there has to be something here for me.  i just need to find it.  when i'm least expecting it, right?

i start my new job on monday.  i'm excited for this new beginning.  hopefully all will go well.  school started off great and continues to get better with each passing week--everyone i've met is so friendly and welcoming, stern is truly the right place for me.  i hope my new job is more of the same.  i don't think i could deal with regret of leaving my old company at this stage in the game.  i'm already regretting enough as it is."

"event","there are two groups of guys in the world: those who i like, and those who like me.  these two groups are mutually exclusive.  of course, many flip flop between the two groups over time.  but rarely--<i>rarely</i> does one belong to both simultaneously.

i should have remembered this.

i have been seeing someone. let's just call him 'mclovin' for simplicity's sake, for the past two months.  everything was great.  more than great.  wonderful.  we spent time together.  he took me on well-planned dates.  we discovered we had more and more in common.  we just plain enjoyed each other's company.

then this weekend, on the two month mark, he blew me off.  blatantly.  friday evening we talked about meeting up later when he got off work, and he said he'd call.  he never did.  fine, things happen.  but he didn't call today.  or tonight.  just nothing.

i haven't said anything to him.  i'm not going to reach out.  if he found someone else, fine.  if he doesn't like me anymore, fine.  but there's really no excuse for treating someone you supposedly care about with such disregard.  no excuse at all.

i'm done.  he can go on his merry way, he won't hear one word from me.  it's just so frustrating.  after dating dozens of guys this past year [one semi-long term, and then a slew of first and second dates, mainly with men who liked me, yet who i couldn't stand], i thought, ""hey, this is going really well.  we're a great match.  we're looking for the same thing.  awesome!""  of course, as always, it was too good to be true.  not that new york guys are bigger assholes than guys elsewhere, but i just feel like there's this constant mentality of trading up and not getting tied down--because there are so many possibilities out there.  at times, i'm victim to it too.  but it makes me feel like every effort is futile, and romantic happiness is impossible in this city.  there's just too much going on.

in other news, i had a second interview on friday morning, and got a call from their human resources department that afternoon.  by the time i had a chance to call back, the office had closed, but i'll find out what they wanted on monday.  it has to be good, right?  contact that soon after an interview, right?  it's not my first choice, but the job is definitely looking better than it did during my first interview.  i'm excited.

at least i've learned from the past, and my bullshit threshold is at an all time low.  at least i'm not sitting back and letting it ruin me.  i'm enjoying the ride i'm on, and that which the next few months will bring.  if i have to do it alone, so be it."

"event","i've been so busy lately.  i took my summer vacation this past week, and spent most of the time running errands and getting ready for school, and still haven't finished everything.  at least i only have a few more forms to hand in, and a couple of books to buy.  during my week off i also had some fun, i went with my sister to nanny our cousin's little boys, did some shopping [target, of course!], visited my family, went to coney island, and read books and wrote in central park.  i also did lots of walking around the city, which i love. 

this past weekend was pre-term orientation for my program at nyu.  i was excited for school before, but now i can't wait.  i was dreading having to spend two full days of my weekend watching presentations and doing stupid icebreaker games, but it turned out to be great.  i met so many friendly and interesting people.  it also helped that we had a giant happy hour last night!

[apparently nyu is very big on the happy hours, and there are multiple events per week...all of the continuing students and panel members kept nonstop talking about the happy hours throughout the weekend.]

in other news, i have been interviewing for a new position and received an offer for an offer.  they told me that they want to hire me and asked if i want the job, to which i said yes, which in turn set the approval process wheels in motion.  they have to have everyone sign off on the offer before they can present it to me, which can take up to three weeks.  keep your fingers crossed that the approval process goes smoothly and quickly, so i can give my notice and get out of my miserable job asap!

i've come to realize that i really have had no patience with my life.  at the beginning of the year i was a little discouraged that things weren't going my way at all.  so i set some goals for 2007, and have almost met them all!  i did well on the gmat, got into the school of my choice, and now am getting a better job [not to mention a bit more money--every little bit makes a difference!].  the year is halfway over and i've accomplished so much.  and there is still so much left to do!  i'm pretty excited about the months to come."

of course, it's kind of obnoxious that tea drinking has become the cool thing to do.  where were you years ago, when the coffee trend was in full swing?  i don't know about you, but i was sitting here with my twinings earl grey.  but i guess i can't really complain, considering that if it weren't for the interest of the masses, i'd be stuck gagging down lipton brisk in a can.

in other news, this weekend i had my first ever cockroach situation.  as in, i saw my first cockroach ever, aside from the giant south american ones they have under glass at the liberty science center.  this bugger was real.  and big and brown, and crawling out of my bathroom towards my bedroom.

of course, i did what any other tough girl would do.  i jumped up on the living room chair and screamed and screamed and my roommate screamed and our visiting friend screamed.  i almost cried.  i honestly almost vomited.  finally the roommate killed it and cleaned it up.  she was a little less scared, as she had seen them before.  not me!  i can deal with mice.  they don't bother me.  rats?  not as good, but still ok.  but roaches?  no.  they have been added to the list of my deathly fears.  right along with tornadoes, bees, and bears.

we ran out for bagels and ate them in the park.  i then came back and put six combat discs around the apartment--our apartment is small, so it may have been a bit overkill, but i don't care.  then i wore my galoshes.

by that evening i had calmed down a bit and was actually able to touch things in my apartment again, like, the couch.  still in the galoshes, though.  it's been about 56 hours since that encounter, and i haven't seen another one.  hopefully there are NO MORE where that guy came from!"

<p>
+ mansions on the bay<br>
+ swimming pools!<br>
+ tons of amazing food<br>
+ every kind of beer/wine/liquor imaginable<br>
+ somehow avoiding sunburn<br>
+ wiffle ball without any running involved<br>
+ bars with the best dancing ever<br>
+ really great people, both old and new<br>
+ watching the sun come up out back by the water<br>

<p>
- guidos with prickly shaved arms<br>
- guidos and overly drunk strangers<br>
- boys who, when they decide they want to dance with you, just go up behind you and start rubbing their penis on your butt.  not ok!<br>
- vomiting from too-strong pre-made cosmos [still don't get how that happened, but i bounced back fast].<br>
- 7:30 am 2 hr trek back to manhattan on no sleep.<br>
- 2 mile cab rides that cost 10 dollars per person.<br>
- awkward hellos with a jet setting bachelor who once initiated a serious hand-holding session with me.<br>
- jet setting bachelors in general.<br>

also, apparently ""ginormous"" and ""crunk"" have been added to the dictionary.  what has the world come to?  soon they'll be adding tween text message/instant messaging lingo.  it's only a matter of time."

"event","my best friend was here!  

yes, my very best friend in the world was in town for her little brother's highschool graduation, and swung by the big city for an afternoon.  it was fantastic.  she, her brother, his girlfriend, and i wandered around the village/soho, shopping and eating gelato.  i got some skinny jeans.  i'm working on getting over my fear of them.  right now i'm able to wear them around the apartment.  i don't know...there's just something so wrong about skinny jeans + my ass.  i don't know if the world is ready for that.

after that we headed to hoboken to pick up her stuff at her brother's place.  it was my first time back since i moved, and we walked through my neighborhood and everything, as her brother lives a few blocks past my old place.  it was a beautiful day, and i missed it.  a teeny tiny bit.

we spent the rest of the evening in a drunken haze...we had glasses of cheap wine in the train station bar waiting for our train, then visited her parents, returned to my house where we listened to old records, got pretty, reminisced, and had a couple cosmos before heading out.  and no, we did not drive.  we forced my sister to chauffer us around.  we are responsible adults!

we decided to do the berkeley heights bar crawl.  first stop: traprock brewery.  a fancy microbrewery in our town.  our friend elizabeth was working, but was released as soon as we arrived, so we didn't have to purchase any overpriced drinks while waiting for her shift to end.

next stop was the towne tavern, previously flynn's.  now flynn's was a shady bar on an industrial road in chatham.  people got beat up there.  once, my father said, someone was even killed.  flynn's was not a place that you'd ever set foot into.  but recently the ownership changed and it cleaned up a bit, and my father even gave his stamp of approval.  this is convenient, considering our town's dive, the alley bar and grill, randomly shut down a few months ago.

when we walked in i was a bit nervous, but it was just a plain room with a square bar with townies seated all around it.  it was brightly lit, in contrast to the smoky, scary, dark place i had imagined while driving past all those years.  the bartender was friendly!  the people didn't bother us!  it was...fun!

we had a few drinks there, and our tab came to a whopping total of $10.  we were told it was ""ladies' night""...probably because we were just about the only ladies in there, but no matter.  i don't question cheap/free drinks.  ever.

next we headed over to tgi friday's.  we were in the mood for some highschool sightings.  usually you could find everyone at the alley, but since it closed everyone scattered to neighboring bars.  friday's was always a good bet though.  although this time we only saw one fat sleazy looking fellow gl-er, it was enough to satisfy our curiosity.  my sister and elizabeth had a sighting of someone from their graduating class as well...but theirs had gone the way of thug life 4-eva instead of fat and gross.  ah, give him a few years.  he'll be there too.

after gallons of mojitos and mountains of appetizers [potato skins i LOVE you], we were ready to roll.  [note: good idea forcing sister to drive us].  our bar tab here was also ridiculously cheap...practically nothing for six people!  amazing!  whenever carolyn and i get together something crazy or amazing happens.  this time, us saving about $100 must have been it.

we drove her home, gossiping about boys as always, and reminiscing about the crazy shit of our past...kind of sad to think we were once called ""thelma and louise"" and now we see each other for a couple days once a year, twice if we're lucky.  it's just something you don't expect...your best friend getting engaged and not coming home after graduation.  but i love her, and i love her fiance, so i guess settling for visitation rights isn't all that bad."

"event","so this past weekend i went to south beach, miami, with seven other ladies.  it was a great time.  friday we had tropical storm whatshisname, which resulted in a leaky lunch, some soaked window shopping, and a trip to the movies to see 'knocked up.'  funniest movie ever, hands down.  

determined to not let the weather get to us, that evening we had a couple drinks in our room and then headed to the bar downstairs for a couple proper cocktails before heading out.  we ended up staying at this bar for a couple hours because the worst part of the storm had hit us.  to make the evening bearable, the owner of the hotel was tending bar.  he welcomed us with a bottle of patron poured freely, and anything else our hearts desired.  he was some crazy middle aged southern/surfer dude with lots of chest hair...but who cares!  because after an hour, we were invited to come behind the bar and make whatever drinks we wanted for ourselves...no money exchanged.  more people came into the bar, and i don't think i saw one single dollar exchanged through the night.  he was all over one of my friends, and offered me ""reefer""...ha right.  by the end of the night he was mouthing ""i love you"" to every female across the room...but all is fair in the land of free drinks, as long as your hands stay where they can be seen.

we headed to this salsa-ish club which turned out to be pretty fun.  crazy mojitos [i was in heaven--i love mojitos and everywhere we went made them exquisitely...even the dives had fresh mint available] and frozen drinks took over the night...when in rome, right?  i befriended a bevy of homosexuals and one poor boy from boston who had lost his friends while my friends butts were grabbed and they were propositioned for sex.  i guess i've perfected my ""don't you dare"" look, because i had no problem whatsoever.  after asking the bartender for the closest location of drunk food, a few of us stumbled a few blocks down the road, where we feasted on burgers and nachos at 5am.  some drama and a lost cell phone and some police involvement followed before bed.  nothing out of the ordinary.

saturday began hazy, but that was good enough for us.  after a few hours [3 or 4?] of sleep, we ran across the street to the beach, where, although i wore the highest spf i could find [45], i somehow burned to a crisp.  but of course, it didn't develop until hours later.  we enjoyed a leisurely lunch on espanola way, and finished it off with disgusting amounts of gelato.  while three of us headed back for a nap, others met up with the bachelor party.

yes, here comes the good part.

it turns out the reason we booked this trip was because one of us ladies was invited to a coworker's bachelor party.  so we made it into our own trip as well.  these boys were trashy long island guidos at the worst.  the groom's younger brother, 17, was not old enough to get into bars, so the groom got hookers for him and another guy, which they switched back and forth with. if you are wondering what a dose of AIDS costs in miami, it's $180.  

anyway, they had been boozing all day and after my nap i met up with some college friends who were in the area for a bit, then headed to the bar to start the party.  after one drink and being pawed by at least 10 disgusting, sweaty boys [apparently only 3 of which were part of the party], i had to take my leave.  there's only so much machismo i can take at one time.  that, and jesus tattoos.  can't take too many of those.  also, one of the ladies [a coworker] was getting just a little to intimate with the groom...in public.  if you want to do god knows what with your coworker before your big day, that's fine.  but please, not all of us get our kicks from watching white trash infidelity.

that night we had a nice dinner [shrimp and crabmeat salad with vinaigrette for me, if you must ask], and some of the group headed over to the bachelor suite to party.  as i had vomited in my mouth twice already that evening, and was over-drank and over-sunned, i stayed back.  i heard it was nothing spectacular.  just drinking in a suite full of mirrors and clear, trashy furniture.  like the set of a porn.  the next morning i asked my friends what time they left.  they said, ""when the hookers arrived.""

AGAIN.

the next morning we were out of the hotel as the sun was coming up.  everyone was still dressed in their club clothes, walking down the strip, lining up at the deli.  i wish we had more time, but as a somewhat unplanned trip, it was fantastic.  there are so many more places i want to check out...i'll definitely be back next year.  oh miami, you are a lot of fun."

in other news, it's back to the dating scene.  which i HATE.  i hate meeting new boys, i hate first dates, i hate having to excuse myself to the ladies room to escape boring/stupid/cheesy/annoying dudes.  on friday i somehow got roped into talking to this guido from staten island (my friends were talking to his friends), and after a long discussion about why i did not have a summer share in manasquan (um because i'm a grownup and have rent to pay), he reached around my back and said, ""oh, your tag.""  i thought the tag on my shirt was showing.  but no.  he continued with, ""yep, just had to check, MADE IN HEAVEN.""

ha! 

i never knew people actually used lines like that!  i pretended my sister was calling with an emergency (she really was calling--but was just drunk.  thanks for the perfectly timed call, sister.) and politely excused myself.  i then proceeded to spend the rest of our time there up at the bar in the company of some pretty entertaining strangers.  thanks, strangers!

i kind of just want to hide.  but if i don't jump in to the horrible, horrible fire, i never will.  if nothing else, at least it will make for some good stories, right?  i mean, i have been stuck with a pretty bad case of writers' block lately.  maybe this will make for a nyt bestseller haha."

"event","i love living here.  and this is why.

after work, i headed home, ran through a rainstorm, and relaxed for a bit.  afterwards, i headed back downtown to a posh rooftop bar at a new boutique hotel (sorry can't tell you--we want to keep this a well-kept secret spot or it will be ruined) for cocktails with a few work friends.  it just so happened to be a place that i've been dying to stay at, but at $400 a night, and only a ten minute cab ride from my apartment, it's a no go.  but the bar is a great time.  upscale, very quiet, and a delicious specialty cocktail list.  not exactly affordable for more than a social drink or two, but nice when you have a generous friend!  thanks, generous friend!

i cut out early, and headed to the village for my every-other-week writing group meeting at manatus restaurant, a very clean and well-run diner on bleecker.  my group hails from both manhattan and brooklyn, and we critique a different writer's work each meeting.  we worked through this week's piece and had our usual chitchat.  it's only been the second real, down to business meeting that we've had, and it's really going well.  we're a group of five, and each person's writing style and opinions fit together nicely to get full, rounded critiques.  

afterwards, i walked a few blocks with a couple friends to amy's bread shop.  apparently it's been j's after-group ritual.  everything there looked amazing.  i got a small cookie, but am planning to go back to try some of the breads and cakes.  and across the street was a gelateria!  and it's all near my friend's noodle shop!  the next time i'm there, i've got it all planned out.  dinner at noodle bar (on carmine at bleecker, you should all go there if you're in the area, order the crab rangoons), then gelato for dessert, then a stop for bread before heading home.  

around the corner was my beloved f train where we all parted ways.  and i was home, in my apartment, within 25 minutes.

it's nights like this that make me want to experience everything that exists in this city."

"event","things are finally slowing down.  we're almost fully settled into our new apartment--there are only a few pictures left to hang, but that's about all.  it's looking more like a home, not some ""weird hotel"" as my roommate put it the other day.  smaller than we're used to, but not as small as it could be.  the neighborhood is also nice.  very convenient to everything and not too crazy, not too dead.  there are tons of restaurants, all of which look worth trying out.  oh, and all of our windows face courtyards, so our apartment is quiet at all times.  i love it.

i'm also no longer speaking to that boy i like.  i thought things would be good, what with us now living relatively close to each other, but i was wrong.  he had been acting kind of weird since i moved--maybe scared that i was going to hijack his life?  who knows.  it's too bad that it happened now that i'm finally in the city, but i suppose it's a good time to move on, what with everything else changing as well.  it's upsetting, but in the past few days i've come to realize a lot of things, namely that i was holding on to something that didn't really exist.  sure he could be nice, but i was getting used to settling for being second best to his friends and being treated like crap most of the time.  i constantly made excuses for it, just because the good times were amazing.  i have never done that before.  at the time i didn't realize it, but here i was, letting some guy walk all over me.  when the news got around this weekend, i got the incredulous ""what took you so long???"" from all my girl and guy friends alike.  apparently everyone could see the situation for what it was except me.  

yeah, i do miss him, but that will go away if i continue to just push forward.  we aren't speaking, so it's relatively easy compared to breakups i've had in the past with all the emotionally charged arguments back and forth.  being back in the 100% single world (apparently we ""weren't dating"" and i was ""quasi-single"" at the time...yeah that's a bullshit red flag if i've ever seen one) can be very tiring, but so far it's been liberating.  i'm still not sure what i'm ready for, but i've been introduced to a cute boy who has already asked to see me again...maybe i'll give him a try.

happy mother's day to all you moms out there.  and especially to mine!"

on my way back, i passed by the neighborhood cafe.  seated with his back to the window, was a boy sitting alone with coffee, reading liner notes to some cd.  liner notes!  in this day and age of itunes, and buying songs--not full albums, here was a boy, sitting, reading liner notes!  it didn't even matter what band.  here, in this town of horrible bland yuppies, was a boy who appreciated the importance of the details.  where did he come from?  how long had he been here?  why were we not friends?  we had to become friends!

but then i remembered, i am leaving.  moving to a city full of people who still buy vinyl and limited edition silk-screened show posters and read zines.  where people who like things other than ""sports"" and ""beer"" aren't so few and far between.  i know it will be great.  but i think i'll miss living someplace where it's a nice surprise to run into someone like me."

in other news, my writing group may be disbanding.  we have this one guy who's kind of creepy.  he write stories about murder and sex and perversion...which, is fine, if done well.  but his writing skills are that of an 8th grader.  my one friend secretly e-mailed another member and i to say that she was bailing on account of creepy guy's stories and attitude.  we suggested that we start a smaller, more dedicated group.  honestly, i would rather just pick a new meeting place and not tell creepy and go on as normal.  i think if she drops it, it may be the end...because i know i probably won't continue unless we find another serious writer to fill in the gap.  right now i'm waiting to hear back from her...i hope we reach some kind of conclusion that works for all of us, because without this group, as far as writing goes, i am screwed.  with business school looming on the horizon in september, i won't have time or money to take another class, so this is my only hope.  gotham dropouts, don't fail me now!"

i want to erase the mistakes.  but more than that, i want to just say ""fuck it"" and not care about any judgement cast on me.  to do more than keep a smile when my heart breaks--to not feel it.  to know that i am my best friend, and that it's enough.  but you need more than just yourself when you have billions of tiny chemicals bouncing around in your brain, making you sabotage your very best efforts.  best friends aren't supposed to stab you in the back.  best friends aren't (supposed to be) enemies.

then we hopped in the limo and went down to aer.  the girl who planned the party said that we were on the list and she knew people there.  well, in reality, she talked to one of the bartenders at porky's (horrible lame ass bar for 21 year olds) and he said he'd call over and get her on the list.  the doorman was unimpressed, as aer is guestlist only, but we got in.  cover was $20, and the girl thought that we should be comped, so we got $5 off.  i don't know.  she might think she's cool for bargaining with doormen to get us in, but it's pathetic.  either you know someone or you don't.  and trying to weasel your way in doesn't make you look cool.  it just makes you look sad and desperate.

i don't know, i just don't get it.  i have ""friends"" (and i use that term loosely) who can get me wherever i need to go in this city, but i avoid all that.  i did the whole jetset club thing while living in london, and it wasn't that great.  i don't know, i have no desire to hang around with vapid models and drug addicts trying to outdo each other.  give me a dive bar with a good mix of people, that i can wear sneakers to, and i will love you forever."

"event","guess where i am!

sitting in bed!

this is amazing for two reasons:

1. i finally got rid of my decrepit falling apart horrible old ghetto computer and got a shiny laptop (which i will be paying for for a loooong time).

2. i am on the internet.  yes, our internet is fixed.

i don't really have anything of worth to say, just wanted to post because i have internet.

oh except the ex boyfriend of ten months has a new girlfriend, and i found this out through the INTERNET.  no, i wasn't stalking.  it was an accident.  or coincidence.  i don't know.  it just wasn't stalking.

and it's hard.  i don't want him anymore, but in the back of my mind it was like i could always have him if i wanted to.  and now i can't.  actually, not even that.  how can you go from loving someone so much to moving on to someone else?  it takes time to heal.  i'm learning that heartbreak can resurface.

and also, i made a new friend.  a female friend.  i am excited, because it's so hard to make girl friends.  i mean, you can't just pick up a girl in a bar and say, ""let's be friends and go shopping and hang out.""  it doesn't work that way.  but this girl seems nice, and perhaps my circle will widen.  which i have been stressing over lately.  that my world is shrinking instead of expanding.  but this will be good."

things went so much better when i went with my heart.  before the nervousness and overthinking set in.  but my heart was beating so fast and i couldn't breathe and my brain didn't know what to do, so i did nothing.  every word i said was stupid and every non-move i made was wrong.  i'm an idiot.  but not as much of one as he is.  stupid jerk."

"event","i met david sedaris on saturday night.  we got tickets to a show on his current tour.  amazing.  that man is com-pell-ing.

afterwards, i went to get my copy of ""me talk pretty one day"" signed.  there had to have been about 70 people in line before me, but it took an HOUR to go through!  book signing should be wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.  david sedaris is apparently not cut out for book signings.  he's a regular chatty cathy.  one couple even knelt on the floor in front of his table to chat!  with a line behind them!   

when i got closer, i noticed that
a) he was asking people all questions about their lives.
b) people wanted to be his best friend so they were lingering, and he let them!

when it was finally my turn, we talked for a bit.  he asked what industry i worked in.  i said, ""finance.""  he said ""i pictured you as more of a freewheeler.""  then i said, ""oh i am, it's just my job that's not.""  then we talked about zines, and he signed my book.  i didn't feel bad, considering i was almost dead last in line because of all the line-cutting that had gone on.

he signed my book:

Hi Suzanne,

I'm so happy you're alive!

David Sedaris

and then he did a rubber stamp of a skull and crossbones and wrote in tiny letters, ""i love you!""

so deliciously weird."

the real resolutions are as follows:

1. learn to leave well enough ALONE.
2. make better decisions, especially in matters of love and lust.
3. even when i majorly mess up, to hold my head up high. 
4. learn my lessons well enough so that i only need to learn them once."

"event","so on saturday night, i was curious and decided to try some drinking.  over the course of four hours i nursed 3 drinks, paying attention to how i felt.  i felt fine.  

that is, until i found myself completely fucked up, at 4am, in a taxi yelling at my friend for tearing me away from my one and only true love, who i had met five minutes before while waiting in line for our cheesesteaks.  i would have married that boy on the spot, if he'd asked.

i think it's safe to say i should continue to abstain from alcohol."

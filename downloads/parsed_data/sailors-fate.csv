"event","i just went back and read some of my old journal and it didn't make me as angry as it did earlier this year.

i find it hard to deal with ex's.  maybe this is the case.

*shrug*

i don't know why i started this one to begin with.  maybe because i was tired of complaining and wanted a fresh start?

this is the new school.

same as the old school.

the more things change, the more they stay the same.

there is nothing new under the sun.

each time i sit down and try to summarize things into a journal format, they just come out rotten.  it takes a lot of effort to get that out of the way."

"event","i need to be given a new pair of pants.  and i didn't get any.

but i did get:

Failure ""Golden"" DVD
a Shiner silkscreen poster
Catch 22
the new Nada Surf CD
smooches
a Navy Seal watch
a fleece zip-up jacket

my cell phone sucks and i'm getting pissy because i can't find a plain freakin phone without all of that stupid hoopla that makes it cost me an arm and a leg.

but more than anything, i need a new pair of pants."

"event","things are... good.

not <i>great</i>...

but they have suprisingly turned as good as they can be considering my circumstances.

i'm moving.  i'm getting a new job within the marines, answering to just one boss, my promotion is getting back-dated several months, and this means i get a lot of back-pay.

we'll see how it all pans out.

all i need now is a girlfriend on the same coast as i am.  

preferrably the one i already have.

the girlfriend.  not the coast.  

since she's so awesome and all...

my girlfriend, that is."

"event","so lately i've been suffering from really severe headaches.  i don't know if you should really modify severe with ""really""... but i thought ""severe"" by itself just didn't suffice.  at any rate, i was taken to the emergency room and shot full of drugs friday morning.  the drugs wore off and all i could do all weekend was roll around on my bed, wishing my head would just finish exploding so i could get on with dying.

so it's stress.  a lot of things are happening that i have absolutely no control over... a lot of people are making a lot of decisions that are completely screwing my life to pieces without any thought/regard that i'm the one that's having to live with consequences that are going make themselves known every day i wake up... the minute i step out of bed and wince at the aches, discomforts, and pains in my blown-out ankles and smashed heels.  after hearing that they weren't letting me out of my contract prior to its official end due to all of that, i was resigned to finishing the one year left that i have and making a go of what i've gotten myself into.  so i bring up that i think they owe me a promotion since they're not going to let me go... which they still stand by that i don't deserve due to my injuries, regardless of the fact that they are responsible for them.  however, they think i'm still fit to deploy to iraq and do my job for another year.

i'm fine with going to iraq, but i'm tired of being stepped over and used and used some more.  they're hell bent and determined to squeeze every ounce of use out of me at whatever cost... this coupled with Mads moving to DC and expecting my moving there as well shortly after... it's more than i can cope with sometimes.  she's all i had to look forward to out here.

damn me for an idealist.  i always get myself into shit where i think that i can make a difference and change something or do something noble and it just winds up biting me in the ass.  it never turns out any other way.

here's to gettin fucked over from the get-go and having asked for it."

"event","there hasn't been a female rock singer since ann wilson in heart and this is a damned shame.  i used to have the craziest crush on her, too.  i had these weird notions of going back in time and winning her over and living our lives in this weird forever-70's parallel universe.  i swear she was the hottest woman alive.  

but for the record, joan jett isn't a <i>singer</i>.  and pat benatar isn't rock in spite of some laudable efforts in the early 80's.

that is all."

"event","i'm really having a difficult time drawing a song.  i have no idea how this is going to be accomplished with pencil and paper.

if anyone has an idea of how they would do their own song to drawing/painting, i would much appreciate hearing some ideas.

i picked the cover that shiner did of the bad company song ""making love"" to do this on, but it isn't set in stone.  i could easily pick a modest mouse song or something along those lines that she digs and go with that.

man... the burdens of having an artsy girlfriend and having a little artsy talent...

she could have said ""draw me a duck"" or ""draw me a sperm whale and a panda having a shootout to settle who's closer to extinction"" and i'd have had no trouble.

but nooooo...

not that i'm really complaining.  holy shit am i nuts about this chick.  have i mentioned that?  but i'll not digress.  i just need inspiration to kick me in the face before i whip out a masterpiece."

"event","so it's absolutely disgusting just how much time i spend daydreaming and looking forward to time spent with this girl.  i just feel like i need to get that out of the way.  but let it go on the record that i've never been happier or more excited.

so it seems that my medical discharge is going up finally.  i'm supposed to get some news monday on just how far it's gone.  but from the talk and all of the apologies on just how sorry they were that they forgot about me for the past month or two, they're pushing pretty hard, it seems, to get me out.  so i'm keeping my fingers crossed.  i've gotten nothing but the shaft on this whole military thing so i'm ready to move on to something better, already.  i think i want to be a wrecking ball operator.  it's my dream.

Mads gave me an art project of sorts.  i'm supposed to... <i>draw</i> a song that reminds me of her.  i've got the song picked out but i'm having just a tiny bit of trouble drawing a song.  if this is what art school is all about, then it can eat shit.  i'm going to do this to make her happy and then... wonder how the hell i pulled it off.

i'm pretty confident that i'm going to come up with something awesome, but getting there is proving to be a pain.

...

you're lookin alright tonight, i think we should go."

"event","so in June, she's flying home to arizona and i'm driving out to visit for a few days.  this isn't getting here fast enough and i think i'm going to have to sit down with May and have a little talk.

i cleaned up the inside of my car and dragged out a lot of crap that had accumulated in the backseat... like certificates for going through hazardous material handling classes and van halen cd's.  i enjoyed the inside of my car being clean so much that i decided to drive down to san diego and not be outside of my car for a while.  sitting in the parking lot here in my car would have been ok, but that might have gotten muggy and my battery may have died with the radio playing.  so what's a little gas just to get some air circulating and to keep the music going...

i daydream a lot.
a beer during lunch is nice sometimes.
i miss hum and new good music.
i can't wait to be closer.
i need to rant at work this week.
my week-long vacation has come to an end.
last weekend was perfect and this one was spent wishing for that one again.
she makes me happier than i can ever remember being.
a stomach was never intended to be filled with ice cream."

for his writing SG, i see the relation as i was a huge MST3K fan, and applaud him and see why i found the show so hilarious.  for the Shrunk thing... i dunno.  i'll have to think about this one.  but i guess he had to pay the bills somehow."

"event","i went to fry's and thought about buying Metroid, for a gameboy i somehow acquired somewhere, for at least 15 minutes.  i almost did it, but i probably wouldn't play it much, and if i did, i think i'd be scared that i wouldn't enjoy it as much as i used to... in effect shooting nostalgia in the foot with a hollow point bullet filled with lame.

after deciding that i wouldn't buy it, i turned to exit and saw a revamped version of Final Fantasy I and II.  i had to do it all over again.

i shouldn't be spending too much of my money anyways, as a big road trip to Arizona is coming up early june to see the girl of my dreams.  when she's near, i can't keep my hands off of her and i can't stop grinning.  

sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh sisgh sigh sighs ighs sighsighsi.

i've been sitting around thinking about the home (black hole) in georgia i escaped and i've decided that i'm probably never going back to that place.  it has a lot of trees and a few cotton fields... probably a few dogs and old ladies that can't get around without their walkers.  the old ladies using walkers, that is.  not the dogs.  i can't even remember.  i think there're a few cool people left there that are making a better go of it than i did, but fuck those guys and/or gals.

boiled peanuts are about all you have left for me and i can do without those for at least 4 years before i start wigging out.  at least 4 years.

i have a lot of things to be happy about... madelyn makes me happier than i've ever been and i've got so much spoiling her to look forward to.  it's about damned time.

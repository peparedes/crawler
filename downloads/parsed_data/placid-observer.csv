"event","So our little baby girl is here. She will be my last child. So she got her first baby bath on Monday, August 24th, 2015. She lost her belly button on the 25th and also had her first doctor's appointment. She stopped wearing her baby mittens yesterday the 29th.. These are things I will never be able to enjoy again but my two kids and Tyler are worth it. I have been struggling with the idea for some reason. But I need to come to terms with the fact that Jonah and Tuesday are going to need all my attention and another little boy would just enrage Jonah or put that little boy under Jonah's shadow.. and another little girl would make Jonah a brother of two sisters which is no fun and it would also make Tuesday that awkward middle child. The decision I made is for the best. 
Jonah is doing well. He actually saved me on a couple occasions with Tuesday. She was crying while I was changing her and he handed her a baby doll and she stopped crying.. Then one night I was thinking she wanted to get picked up and I was telling her that I wasn't going to pick her up all the time.. Jonah runs out with a binky and puts it in her mouth and she stopped crying.. It is like they have their own brother and sister language. It is cute. Love my kids."

"event","So I talked to the doctor today I am getting my tubes tied after having our baby girl. I understand that I am young and maybe one day I will want more children.. However, my two children are going to need me and I wouldn't have even had two if I didn't think Jonah needed to have a partner and someone to share life with if something were to happen to Tyler and I.
There is just too many people out there. I can only trust the world to take on two offspring due to the fact Tyler and I are two people who will one day pass on and our children will replace us in this world.
The doctor talked about two what ifs... What if something happened to one of your children? I am pretty sure I would be messed up for life and not being stable in the mind to even imagine having more children. 
What if your marriage falls apart and you want to have another man's children?
Well, that is a possibility I suppose.. but not only have I made a commitment to Tyler but also to my children.. I don't know how to feel about half brothers and sisters.. I will have two that are whole blood and know they came from the same DNA. If I were to be selfish enough to move on away from the family I have now perhaps I am not the best candidate to have another family anyways.
I am going to have faith in God that everything will be okay in his hands and whatever he plans I am on board with. I trust my two children with him and if we have a little girl, Tuesday Rose Hence, on August 18th, 2015. I have full faith and am surrendering to him my ability to bear more children and praying he takes care of the two we have made to roam this earth. Which are Jonah George-Jerald Hence and Tuesday Rose Hence. No more No less. Until my dying day."

"event","So lately a lot has been going on. I have been on the red path towards happiness and I guess I am just afraid I am going to go back to the old ways of Jean. The lists, the mundane lifestyle, and always putting myself on the back burner. Not that putting yourself last is wrong it is just I need to be happy now. I know deep down it isn't Tyler's fault but for some reason I keep blaming him. Maybe it is because he a lot of times is negative and I feel like that does effect me in a sense. This whole other guy scenario isn't working out either. He is very unavailable and full of himself. I know he cares for me but I don't mean to put myself out there that much. Even though he believes he would be the best lover I have ever had I think it might be opposite then I will never get rid of him. So what my plan is is to take time to myself. Then focusing on Jonah, then Tyler, and then Mom. Need to get back to my roots but in a happy and healthy way. Thank you dude for waking me up. But I am sorry you are no longer needed. Never told you but I am a little bit cruel. ;)
Alright then..
Peace."

"event","So the next day we went with my Aunt Sandy on a long car ride through the mountains. It was pretty pleasant Tyler and I were flirting in the back like young lovers. I don't need anymore than what I have I realized. It is just fun sometimes to tease yourself. 

We just hung out and ate dinner after we returned to the reunion house.

We got all packed up and the kids did a talent show that was so cute. We played a little games and I had a glass of wine. Then we retired to the bedroom. The kids staying next to us I had to tell to settle down... feeling so old.

The next morning we got up at 6 am and left. It was a relatively nice 8 hour car ride. When we got home we just hung out until bed time.

Today is my chore day. I have also decided this thing with Don is nothing serious at all. I love my husband and I only want him."

"event","So last night I had a nightmare. It goes like this:
  Tyler and I were at a medical center that was hosting a talent show. We were waiting out turn out in the audience and I was staring of into space when I caught eyes with a dark haired, older gentleman, with glasses on. He gently smiled at me and that made me smile considering when I caught eyes with him it made me uncomfortable. I then averted my eyes to the person sitting next to me's newspaper. Jonah was seated on the other side of this person and Tyler was in front of them. The person handed Jonah to me and I said, ""You are a good boy."" Then Jonah who at this point had a head full of bleach blonde hair exclaimed, ""Ima good boy, Ima good boy."" Tyler and I looked at eachother in shock then looked around and said, ""Those were his first words."" We smiled at eachother and then they called our names to play our song. I gave Jonah to the person with the paper and headed on up. We played our song and then sat back down. The audience called for an encore and Tyler and I looked down the hallway and Cory was coming to play with Tyler. I smiled at Cory and he looked at Jonah then smiled at me. Tyler and him started to play. At the same time as the audience was telling Tyler they couldn't hear him because he was too far away from the mic a doctor who looked like einstien came and said he wanted to take Jonah for a check up. Being distracted by Tyler I said, ""Fine go ahead."" Because it seemed normal to me. 
Meanwhile on stage Tyler dropped his mic trying to grab it to bring it closer to himself and he got that frustrated look on his face but still carried on. Behind me around six seats Cheech Marin and his family sat. The doctor came back and was saying, ""It was a fever."" I thought he was talking about Jonah so I stood up. Cheech Marin then proceeded after the doctor yelling. I followed but then quickly doubled back and asked another man who looked exactly like Cheech Marin as well if he had seen where they went. His baby was facing backwards in a car seat and making weird noises and I asked how old the baby was and the wife responded about two. I then panicked when I realized something fishy was going on and I screamed to Tyler, ""They have taken the baby and they won't give him back."" Tyler who looked very sweaty came running down the hall and we followed in the footsteps of Cheech and the doctor. We ended up on a rooftop. I was the only on to jump off. I landed in a small closet off of a garage. A motorcycle pulled into the garage as I hid in the shadows housed by the closet. A man approached the other man on the bike. They did an exchange that seemed to me like a drug deal. Then the man standing shot the man on the bike and dragged his body and the bike out of the garage. Then an old time car pulled in and the doctor got out. I had no weapons in the closet so I didn't get out I just figured I would follow him. But a little boy with brown hair and glasses pulled me out the sidedoor of the closet and told me he knew where they take the patients. I followed him and as we talked about how they were taking children and cutting their brain in a certain way to make it so when they were adults they would be admitted here because of mental illness I picked up pennies and the little boy started to wheeze. I came up behind him and held him. I said, ""Its okay you just are walking to fast we need to sit down."" He replied, ""No we have to find your baby."" We kept walking and came to a feild with many movie theatres along the sides. I said, ""I see why he likes movie theatres, because he likes watching people. Then we came to the rooftop again and there was a girl with a big nose skinny legaments and she was bald. And she said you cant go any further. I told her I needed to find my son and when she had children she would understand. And she said if I were you I wouldnt have let the doctor hold my two children either. And with that I jumped off the roof again back into the closet off of the garage because in my mind he would return to the garage with his car and I would follow him again. A woman on a motorcycle pulled in this time and was greeted by another woman. The woman with the bike turned around and held up her phone light in my direction and the other woman shot her and said, ""Who are you calling?"" I sat in silence then she said,""You in the closet come out here."" I explained to her my situation as she held me at gun point. She replied, ""A kid that young? you are never going to get him back."""

Just to let myself and everyone know, pregnancy sucks. In the first trimester you are sick all the damn time and you feel achy due to your bones shifting. The second trimester you start feeling weird in the head, some days you are lazy as shit and then others you are organizing cabinets. The third trimester is the worst. The heartburn gets so bad, your back hurts you cant get out of beds or chairs. Your feet swell, and you are nervous about the new addition to your family.
Labor for me wasn't so bad. I had a scheduled c-section due to my small body.. following in my mother's footsteps. When I heard his little cry though, it was the most overwhelmed feeling ever.. it made both Tyler and I tear up.. and his little face with bubbles coming out of his mouth.. after I saw him I got sewn up and brought to the recovery room.. I was messed up by the time I got to my room to see everyone. During the next four days we played house at the hospital and felt out parenthood and I was slightly happy. But having him here at home with us and being a family is the most delicate and hopeful thing. I never thought about my future.. But if this is it I am so happy and grateful. Just cleaning this house and watching him grow will keep me completely content.. I am blessed with a healthy son and a very loving husband. Also the great family we have around us is nice too. I love the world."

I gotta go. Sorry and I will always love you. I never thought I would be one of those people who abandoned you Momma... But the farther and the more distant we get the more I get these flashbacks of the bad times.. But when you are close to me all I want to see is the good times and how we have this magical thing going on.. But I dont have time to be seduced by these lies anymore. I need to let you go. I am so sorry for the way things have turned out for you. And if you ever need me I will be here, but only if you need me truly. No more shannagans. No more conspiracies. I am more than just your little bitch I am a human. I love a man who is now my husband. I am about to figure out if I am a crappy mother. Above all though I need to learn how to love right again. You make my love feel like a sick game. I don't want to play games.. I want to feel in love again. Please take care of yourself for heaven sake. I don't think you wanted grown daughters anyway Mom. I think your parents ruined your view on grown up life period. I have to save myself from the same fate.
I really do love you.. and I am so sorry that Come What May pauses here until we can have a healthy relationship if we ever can.
I will miss the good parts in you and I promise I will use all the good things with Jonah you used with us a kid. I already sing Melanie to him everytime I take a bath. I feel better because this is the only time I have ever got to talk with you without being shut down. Our insecurities just ruined Tuesdays and all that was special between us. The situations that followed were carelessness and bad juju. I hope the hearing goes well so you can have a second chance at freedom.. just use it right this time. I won't be here to mess it up for you. Peace in, Peace out, Peace all around.. and little bunny foo foo too.
Love you Momma.

The only obligatory things I have to get done is writing down what the plans are and finding my mother because no one seems to know where she is. The other night she was over at my Grandmas and she fell down drunk. They say the cops and the emts came so no telling where she ended up.

"event","So lately we have not been getting along. I admit I have been hard on her to make changes for the better. Telling her things I had no right to like how she needs to clean her house if she doesn't want to get kicked out. But I am the one who picks up all the damn pieces every time she lets everything in her life fall a part like she has done countless times. Well lately she has not been there for me. It is always about her feelings or what is going on with her. She claims that she has been fair and patient but I know better. Mom and I have been best friends along with mother and daughter for a while and maybe that was the biggest mistake of all because now not only am I short of a best friend but I realized I traded my Mom for a friend years ago. She says she will be at my wedding I dunno if she will though and on top of that she might act out and I will just have to suck it up. She probably won't be there for the birth of my son because she refuses to accept that Tyler is a good man. I am just done with never having a conclusion to this madness. So I asked her, ""Do you want to try again and we both will be only positive towards eachother and not bring up the past?"" She then brought up the past and talked bad about Ty. So I said, ""So you don't want to try?"" And she said, ""I will be at your wedding but after that it is over."" So I will give her a hug before heading off to Amelia Island and I will say goodbye to my mother for now.
I really don't see how she will fit in my future life with the way she acts. I can't be put down all the time and have Tyler hear dirty messages left for him all the time. I will go visit her just to see how she is once a month. But I plan on getting my number changed. She can call my cell if she needs me. I am just sad that a love so pure got ruined so badly by situations and the both of us. We could have done so much better.
I love my mother more than anyone in this world but I need to walk the red path and she only turns my head other ways. She can only hurt me now. She refuses to let anyone truly help her. If she heals herself I still would have trust issues with her. I am sorry that finally I am like all the rest and I have to let her go. I will miss her and I will always hold the times we had with the most honor. And I promise I will always honor my mother just from a far. I hope God understands I need to heal now too."

"event","I am Jean. I was raised by a woman who prided herself on being alone. I know how to be alone. It just saddens me to realize that all those whom I love besides Tyler have in their own sense abandoned me. My whole life I have made sure these people knew I loved them. They don't call me.. I call them. They don't travel to come see me I travel to them. When around them I have to form to their fitting. In all senses they all see me as a chump and I know this. Lately I have just been noticing the things about the world I don't want my child to endure. He will never be a chump. I know who I am I know I love strong and give people around me enough space to grow.
The lessons I have learned my whole life I am once again over veiwing. I remember all the times I have worried about those I love and I also know myself to be evasive at times as well. But I warn those around me. I am more dangerous now than I have ever been before. You have one chance to decide who you want to be in my life now. Because it is all about the love of my life now and he is not Tyler. He is just a part of him. I will be Jean my whole existance but I am no longer wreckless Jean. I am no longer push over and run over Jean. I am Jean mother of Jonah. I will not be conquered and I shall not care for those who shame me and my family.
I have always been able to do without. When you offer to help I decline then when pushed I accept. Just be ware that I might not be very important to the world or even to you. But I am the stranger who smiled at you and you passed by without even wandering who I was or how I might feel inside. Always looking for a certain answer in my responses and underestimating my competancy I know how you think. I watched you my whole life, it is your laziness that kept you in the dark about me. 
The whole time you said you understood my struggles but you never lifted a finger to help. You threw materials at me. You tought me that you feel normal and that I was not normal. I have always been miles away and been waiting on a train ticket back to love. Now I have that ticket. It was not sent by any of you however. I was sent a ticket by my lord. He knows I know how to love and how to nurture and he never thinks I am stupid or make careless decisions. He knows I know I will only die and that life is his blessing. He knows I have watched all of you and cared about you. I will never care again what anyone thinks of me. I will do what is needed to be done and return to God. Once I deliver Jonah into this world I will have left more than enough to pay back the world for its bedding. Mom just called to tell me how shitty I am once again. This is why I must stop caring.. Conditioning me only to become suicidal, that is why existance alone is fine.. atleast most times it is quiet."

"event","So yeah today I had the day off to do a lot of thinking.. I thought about my relationships, my routines, and the changes coming around the corner.
  Okay first of all my relationships. I need to check in more with my sister and my Dad. With Tyler I want to improve myself. I want to be able to cook all his favorite foods, keep him in a good looking house, be calm and loving to him, be sexy at all times, and be good in bed. With mom I need to be more patient and understanding and be the best friend she could ever ask for.
  Second, my routines.. depending on the day should be the same except for little things such as what I study on work days which will be; Fridays Guitar and Culture. Saturdays beauty and sex. Sundays house cleaning and cooking. Online game and exercise will also change with the day. On my weekends well that is all written down somewhere. Long story short as long as I follow my routine written down I should be good to go for the Hit list.
  Last of all, Changes. Well I am getting 400 dollars for Joey which will go to getting Tyler on the road. So a car for Tyler will be the first change. Then we are going to get a new place come December. I think Tyler and I will be getting married soon I can feel it. After that comes the big change deciding when is a good time for a baby. Demetre George-Jerald Hence or Tuesday Rose Hence. :) What pretty names I am excited about the beginning of the end for our little lives and on to bigger and more important conquest.
  In conclusion, as long as I follow the rules which are: At work if I am running the kitchen I need to act like Angie If I am up front I need to channel Thelma. With Tyler I need to be the best girl for him I can be. With Mom I need to be the best friend I can be. HIT List. And let God help me through my life. I should be fine if I do these things. Peace to all and hopefully this is the last time I think I have my life figured out and actually have a perfect scenario this time. :)"

I would call Momma and dry off for a bit then get into my clothes.. I would hang out for a while and read my Carl Haaisen book.. Tyler, Nicci, Rusty, and I would find some fun thing to do to fill up our morning such as swimming under the covered bridge, playing frisbee, or taking a hike. Then eat lunch and climb up the stairs and into our beds for an afternoon nap. When we awoke we would find some other interesting thing to do until it was time to feast at dinner.. Once dinner was over we would burn it off by going down to the creek near where we stayed at. We would pace across the field and hurry up stairs to fill our cups with the finest of alcohols. After we felt pretty good we would go out to our table with the perfect amount of chairs and played the board games of our choice. Tyler would tuck me in after the game was finished and I would read until my eyes felt heavy enough to shut and have my dreams."

 I love you so much in truth you are so innocent but at the same time corrupt by all those who have hurt you.
You are the rainbow behind the light rain. But I just wanted to describe to you the way you hurt me and the ways you make me feel so good just so I understand better.
 How you hurt me is easy to describe; You and the weather have similarities you both are bright and sunshiny or dark and windy. Some days there is a light rain that soothes the soul on the other hand there is your storms that rip everyone in your way apart. I am just the monument in your little town that watches others come in and build factories and warns them on my label not to build here because they will be unprosperous and your land is protected by the spirit. And yet the storms of your land still tear at me just the same as those who you wish out. I am just different because I will always be there by only the will of myself as your monument. I want to have a place that is peaceful in your town.. it will make my time spent there so much more pleasant.
  How you make me feel so good; You make me feel like you love me so much and I am enough to make the sunshine come out in your world.. that is all a person could ever hope to be to someone else.
I love you more than words can say the only ones I know that come close are ""Come What May"" and I mean those words.
Sincerely and with the love of you better or worse,
       Jean"

Yesterday was a lot of fun Nicci got me some games and she said she was going to get me an XBox, LA Noire, and God of War 3 for Christmas.. So that gives me something to look forward to.

"event","So I have decided now that I have my daily tasks all set out nice and neatly it is time for me to work on the person completing all of them.
Okay here is the most confusing part.. I want to be a strong, confident, and established woman. But I also want to be a spiritual, comical, and cool person.
People are where the second part comes in I guess. When I am doing things alone I need to be the woman I want to be and also be thoughtful. When I am with Tyler I need to be sexy and spiritual because he is my man.
But I think we can do this we just have to try a little harder. Because everything set out in front of us is an oppurtunity to prove ourselves.
I am going to be sexy on the outside.. spiritual on the inside and feel a perfect balance between them :)"

"event","Okay so here it is. I have decide God is trying to tell me I need to be thankful. That was the lesson the whole time. With Mom the lesson was that no matter how strange the person if you are able to feel love you are blessed.
WIth Tyler the lesson is and shall remain if you love and are loved in return anything is possible and if all cards are on the table from both parties there isn't any game anymore which means there is nothing to lose or win and one day just like every cycle is he will be the soul gaurdian of me and take care of me as such. Patience is a virtue folks and money isn't going to teach you shit.
With Mom being sick for all that time the lesson was that you need to realize your time is only as valuable as the way you spend it because the love one's you have could go at any moment and you need to make them feel loved because no one should be alone in this chaotic world.
With my car it made me realize once again that I am a humble person to the fact that I do need help at times and I am very very blessed with a good sister and good Dad who always bail my dumbass out of everything.
Then last night I realized another blessing. I have a home. I have a home. 
Then today at work.. I have a great job, and every work day is a Ronald family reunion. :)"

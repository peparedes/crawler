"event","So this is my last day in one of the most underappreciated cities in the world.  Louisville reminds me of a giant greenwich village in the midwest.  Anybody who comes here falls in love with everything- the bakeries/diners/streets/artists/cafes/conversations -it goes on.  There are everything from rolling hills/forests to rivers to clubs/pubs to run down artist indierock venues to galleries to urban chaos<br>

So today... i have to say goodbye... and what better way to do that then to listen to pavement.  rock and rollin splish and splashin over the horizon what could it be??? its my favorite little hill by my house deep in the woods.  Its where i would hang out and listen to wagner and shoot at bottles and cans. It was like a warrior visiting a sad pathetic  battlesite.  But for me it ment so much.<br>

<br>  So now boston... again.  i'm only a one winter veteran. But at least now i'm going there with more of a purpose i think than before- or at least a clearer purpose.  This upcoming semester at school i'll be working on my movie ""Absurdica""  the script is halfway maybe.  but i know where its going.  So look out for the Greatest movie ever made this winter.  <br>  
So i guess thats something to look forward to eh?"

"event","I've been going antique shopping with my grandma for the past week.  Upon which i learned a little story about my great great grandma, during the 1890's plague.  Apparently during that time the plague was so horrible in Mexico that the government of the time would go into dying peoples houses and steal their bodies and BURY them ALIVE.  My Great Great Grandma's husband was infected and was about ready to die... but being the woman she is and having the Chariker genes... she sat outside on her front porch with only a bible and a shotgun... and if anybody from the government came onto her front lawn she would shoot them dead.  <br>
During this conversation where my grandma was telling me this... she said something about how different today's world was from that world... indians/ gunfights- plagues- brawls on the streets -hugely corrupted governments (moreso then todays) and people buried alive/   Now my grandma took a stance that things today are better...  but then i started thinking-  sure todays world is safer... but does that mean today's world is better??? <br>

 I wonder if the gun battles and plagues and traveling around in desperation made life more adventurous... and as things in the world start settling down... we get more bored and lax...we start to worry about long distance phone bills and traffic tickets  maybe thats why we have so many people who are so aggressive and want to get out this energy...we need to return to the wild west or the times even of unstability.  sure you can run to get tired...and not have to go gunslinging- but wheres the mystique in that?--- its just tame.  <br>
And ultimately thats what i fear life has become slowly now-  tame.  For the most part i mean.  maybe its suburbia really that im refering to though... cuz there are places in the cities ive been to that are definately not tame..."

"event","I have a restrained ignorance to the deconstructed world-  "" if we mechanize what makes us human, that will make us feel like a mechanism""  in other words.  discourse in general  can ruin those real human moments- which for me is ultimately the only reason worth living.  
   <br>So i try to forget my ""definitions"" as much as possible. at least for now I am trying to underanalyse for a while - to see if ""beauty"" in its most elemental form can emmerge through a translucent ignorance.  <br>
   This stems from being in a generation of sunburned post-post modern cynics...  becuz when beauty and hope is lost, the only option one feels is cynicism.  you can witness it in the past with writings from erasmus and sir thomas moore- and today in practically anyone. So obviously there is a pattern to cynicism. <br>
   -if you look at the cyclical nature of human thought-  you can group human thought into two groups- romanticism and rationalism-    they keep flipping back and forth.  for example after the scientific revolution there was a general feeling of dehumanization in life-  everything was TOO real.. so the arts and mind shift towards the romantic period of music and painting-  in essence to bring back beauty in life.  we are currently on that point in the flux.  beauty and a romanticization of life are starting to come back. cynics pleas are going to be heard. <br>
    So currently i am trying to be aware of the discourse in thinking- whether it be from existentialism, nihilism -all deconstructive philosphies... i am trying to fuse them with romantic thought, and to make a comforting and beautiful discourse of the decontructed 21st century perspective.  One that we can live in with the motto ""intelligence is bliss"" in spite of ignorance."

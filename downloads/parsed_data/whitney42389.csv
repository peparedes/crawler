"event","<P>Hello everyone....It's been a while since I've updated, but oh well. Hmm...things are much better, yet...worse at the same time. Well, I mean, everything with me is fine, but my friend....(who I swore to her that I wouldn't give out names or information) Well, she has a problem...I'm not even gonna name the problem. But I mean, those of you who pray...pray for my friend. She desperately needs it.&nbsp; Her Mom found out about her problem though...and she's going to theropy. So, I don't need to be that worried...still though. Anyway, that's all I'll say about that. Hmm....well, like I said before, things in my life are going so much better. Last weekend wasn't as bad as I really thought it would be....well, Friday was. My Dad made me go to this Youth Rally thing over at Southside....well, he wasn't gonna make me, but he was all ""If you don't go to this, your word will mean nothing, and I won't trust you anymore."" I got <EM>so</EM> mad at him. I hate it when he pulls stupid little things like that! I absolutely hate it!!! So of course, communication with my Dad was limited the entire weekend, and kinda still is now...like, I'm not mean or anything, I just won't go up and talk like I used to. Well, the Southside thing...sucked. It sucked <STRONG>big time. </STRONG>Everyone there was with their church but me. Just imagine this-- Me...of all people, sitting <EM>alone</EM> (which never happens) in my seat...without talking to <EM>anyone</EM> for two whole hours! That's right, no one I knew was there. Well, no one I talk to anyway. They're all snobs....and not to much fun to talk to. So, my Dad finally came, and he was all ""You had a good time didn't you? Was I right?"" I just looked at him with my Don't-talk-to-me-you-wasted-my-Friday-night look, and he kept his mouth shut. Victory is sweet. The next day though, got better...but not perfect. We went to the mall, and Mark got to come! But, my overprotective parents, made us walk with my Mom!! My gosh, I wanted to slap someone! You'd think after almost 10 months, I could at least walk around in the mall by myself with him, but no! We walked with her, and all we did was hold hands basically. It was so sad, because we couldn't even hug each other! (My Parents don't believe in any ""physical contact""&nbsp;&nbsp;between a guy&nbsp;and girl&nbsp;until your dead.) So, It was just...sad. But we got through it. It was worth it though. Because, I'd rather see him, then not see him for another week. Which, we're going to the movies either tomorrow or Saturday....I think. It really just depends on my job. I think I start today. I'm pretty sure I do anyway....we have to go down there today, so...yeah. Easter was cool...I got the Jessica Simpson Limited Edition CD, so...that was awesome. Drama is going alot better. Sure, I don't know my understudy part, but I don't think Amy will get sick. Well, I'm praying she won't get sick. My Birthday is one week away, and I'm not sure if I'm having a party or not. If I do, then I'll just invite Mark, Renae, Katie, Lacey, Amber, Amy, and Drew to the Mall, and all the girls will spend the night, and the guys will go home. I think it's a pretty good plan. That's in one week though, so I gotta make some calls! And ask my parents. lol. Also in a week, is my Drivers ED test. And I think I'm ready. I really do. I'll just show Renae's Dad....he was like ""I doubt she'll get it in a week, 91% fail that test...."" blah blah blah. You know, I really dislike him. And I'm gonna prove That I know it! this time in two weeks, I'll have my permit. You just watch me. Oh, and my Driving is alot better now. I've driven flawlessly everyday this week now, and I feel confident again! Well, I better be going. Thanks for reading the story of my life. Comments people! Even if I don't know you, comments!</P>

"event","<P>Okay....think back...way back into the time that you've known me. (Not many people know about this journal, but for those of you who do, think) Alright, now when have you ever heard me say that life sucks? Probably never, but you are right now...I'm just so depressed. Well, like....okay..lemme explain the little story. Well you know, I'm a perfectionist you know...and I was trying to pull our van around to the back out of this thing, and I hit the side of it......and now there's a big dent in it. My parents (or well..my dad anyway) Said not to worry about it 'cause there's this guy at our church that'll fix it. But my Mom probably won't let me drive with her when I get my permit..and I feel like a driving failure....because I screwed up on it, and I hate screwing up on anything! Yeah, besides all that I'm kinda worried about something that happened on Saturday night. Well, I was in a bad mood then too, and when Mark called, I was kind of angry about alot of things....so, I was mean to him. so, I feel really bad about that. We didn't talk yesterday, and he called me a few hours ago, but we only talked for about 5 minutes...when he called I was in the middle of crying my eyes out. Not just about the whole car thing...but about everything. The feeling of me being overwhelmed.....It's like I can't take it anymore! It's awful. Yesterday at Church it was alright...Renae didn't show up. So, it was just me, Courtney, and CJ in Sunday school...which CJ's Dad taught....*shivers* I'd rather Mr. Tom do it....I mean, he's boring enough! Um....so, like I spent the whole church service writeing notes with CJ {Twilight Zone music starts playing} Haha...It was pretty funny though...I goofed on how girl-crazy he is. It was hilarious. Yeah, and after church, I spent 5 hours cleaning my parent's room. I swear...it was messier than mine! But I guess it was worth it because I got to go to Subway, which I've been dying to go to forever....and then I got about 10 dollars.....Well, I'll go now. *sighs* I just hope things get better soon.</P>

"event","<P>I hate this. I hate this alot....this sucks. I am completely overwhelmed right now. It's 7:15 on a Saturday morning, and I'm already P'oed for the day....and who else is to blame but MaSue? I have to help at this Childrens Day camp thing at 9:00. So, I set my alarm clock for7:30 which is plenty of time to get ready. Well she came parading in my room at 6:45! Our new kittens were crying, and she was all ""Oh my goodness gracious. You haven't taken the responsibility of feeding your kittens. You wanted them, so if that means you have to get up out of bed and feed them, then go."" Well, I had gone in the room 15 minutes earlier, and they didn't want their bottle...they just wanted to be held, and played with, and when I walked in the room with her, they stopped crying. They were asleep for Bob's sake! And I'm in charge of the laundry. I got it all done yesterday, but seeing that there's four kids in my family, it tends to pile up every single freakin day. So she's all ""Whitney, when are you gonna do this laundry? Your Daddy says your in charge of it. Do you need any help folding it? Is it too much for you to handle?"" I wanted so bad just to tell her to back off, and that&nbsp;I had everything under control...but of course, if I did that...major trouble. So I just bit my tounge and said ""No thank you, I got it."" Ugh! I swear she gets on my last nerve alot of the time. I mean, if you think your Grandmother naggs you everytime you visit her--try living with her. I'm sorry, I know this sounds mean....but I'm glad they're moving. I can handle my Mom alot better than I can her. Okay, change of subject- Yesterday, the fashion show thing actually went pretty good. Except for Renae was PMSing majorly. Like you know...we play around alot and like, we were talking, and I don't even remember how this came up in the subject, but she goes ""Yeah...you and Mark talk about me all the time. It gets <EM>so</EM> annnoying sometimes"" and I'm like ""No Renae sweety, we have better things to talk about."" even though I said it in a playing voice and all...it's the truth. So anyway, she got all mad....or playing around mad, I'm not really sure. But like, I needed help with my dress or something, and I was like ""Renae, could you help me out for a sec?"" and she just gave me a look like 'do it yourself' and walked off. I swear...I was so mad at her, I about kicked her...again. So, I came home all upset, mostly angry.&nbsp;Mark called, so I called him back, and hile I was talking to him letting out all my anger and stuff...you'll never guess who beeped in: Okay, so maybe you will, yeah Renae. I never let Mark go to talk for Renae, but I'm like ""Hey, it's Renae (I was in the middle of complaining about her) call me back in five minutes."" So, I clicked over, and since I was incredibly angry with her, I wanted to know why she was calling. She was like ""Hey! When are we supposed to be there tomorrow?"" I said in my plain 'I'm mad at you, why are you calling my house' tone ""9:00"" And I was quiet until probably a few minutes later, I was like ""Aren't you mad at me or something?"" and she goes ""....No...."" Like she didn't know what I was talking about. So, about that time, Mark beeped back in...and I just excused her major rudeness to PMSing and left it at that. One of the perks to my Parents not being here is that my 9:00 get-off-the-phone rule is gone. So, me and Mark talked from about 7:45, to 11:00 (hehe...shh...I'm a bad girl!) Well, I woulda stayed on longer, but Ben came into the room I was in, and was like ""Whitney!! Oh my gosh!! It's 11:00!! Get off that phone!!"" So, I got off, because if I woulda stayed, he woulda told on me. But talking to Mark for that long made me feel a whole lot better! Especially what we talked about. But I won't get into that, because it's all mushy girlfriend/boyfriend stuff...if you really wanna hear about it though, you know my AIM sn is at the bottom so, just ask, and I'll tell...well, I need to rush in the shower. I'll talk to you tomorrow!&nbsp; </P>

"event","<P>Hey! Well, everything's been going alright...my Parents called on Wednesday night, so I know they're alive. Yesterday, I couldn't get online. Something's wrong with my computer all of a sudden. I don't even know how I got online this time! Yesterday was the first time in a long time that I talked on the phone all night. Okay, so it's been like, two weeks, but it was still really cool. I talked to Renae, Mark, and Katie...when I was in the middle of talking to Renae, my parents beeped in, and I couldn't call her back like I said, because she's not allowed on the phone after 8:00 (Don't ask....) So, she's probably all mad. She'll get over it though. I mean, please. Tonight is that Fashion Show thing at my Church. We're supposed to show what ""modest clothing"" is. It was MaSue's idea.....I don't think any of us want to do it really. But we're all doing it for her since she's moving. The clothes we're ""modeling"" aren't ugly or anything. They just don't show our stomach, and we couldn't have too much cleavage. Oh well. I guess this is my night out this weekend. *sighs* So, today is strictly work. I have to clean my house up,&nbsp;(I haven't really cleaned since my parents have been gone), and I have to fix both my little sister's hair. I need to crimp Rachel's,&nbsp;and just plain wash Courtney's. I really wish I could see Mark this weekend, but I <EM>know</EM> that won't happen. Masue thinks I should break up with him. She thinks we've been going out 'too long'. Sure, it's been 9 months, but I'm happy! Who would I go out with other than him? Besides, I love him. So, why break up with him? Alot of my family keeps saying I should. But they have no control over my personal life. Ugh, I am gonna be <EM>so</EM> busy in the next two months. I might not have online time very often. The play at Drama&nbsp;club is coming up, and I don't know my understudy part, at all! And I'm supposed to know the whole thing by Wednesday. I'm screwed....totally screwed. <EM>And</EM>&nbsp; I'm supposed to be starting my summer job this month...probably in the next two weeks. <EM>And</EM> on top of all that, I really, really need to study for my Drivers ED test! It's just terrible. I'm so overwhelmed...but, for some reason, I like being busy like this. It makes me feel needed. The downside is, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to have a birthday party this year. I might just wait and have a <EM>huge</EM> Sweet Sixteen party next year since I'm so busy this year. I could invite like Mark, Renae, and Katie and we could call go to the mall or something. Yeah, that'd be cool. Crap, I'm also a Vacation Bible School teacher at my church. That means, I have to plan the lessons and all that! And there's also a million just-for-fun stuff I haven't even <EM>mentioned</EM> to my parents....and I still wanna have fun. And I don't know what I'm gonna do about camp. Renae can't go this Year, and Mr. Tom is leaving, so we'll have no youth leader....maybe I can go with Mark's church. I'll have to bring it up to my parents. Because as far as I know, I don't think we're going to camp. Yeah, and in the middle of all that, I have to redesign my new room.....and I don't think I'm gonna make the end-of-the-year party/dance thing at Drama. *sighs* I have too much stuff going on....well, I'm gonna go start cleaning now. I'll update as soon as I find the time.</P>

"event","<P>Hey everyone..well, I guess hey to myself. See, none of my friends know about this journal. So, I dunno why I'm even starting it...maybe it's just so I can read it for myself. Well, since this is my first entry, and I know some people search strangers journals just out of curiosity, I'll introduce myself. My name is Whitney. I live in Alabama, and I'm 14 years old (15 in 24 days). I'm homeschooled, but I still have plenty of friends, so I'm not that stereotype homeschooled girl who has no friends and wears a little bonnet. No, quite the opposite actually. Um...what else can I tell you about me? Well, I have a boyfriend named Mark who's name you'll hear very, very frequently throughout this journal. Oh, haha, and I seem to have this obsession with Hilary Duff. No, not a lesbian obsession...ew! (Trust me, I am not like that at all...bleck!)&nbsp;No, I just think she's cool. Hmm...well, I guess thats really all you just <STRONG>need</STRONG> to know about me. So, I guess I'll get started with the journal part of today. Well, it's 9:34 AM, and nothing has really happened today seeing that all I did was wake up. This week is my spring break. So no, I'm not just slacking off in school and doing as I please. But, my parents are in Puerto Rico right now...or, on their way there...I'm kind of stressing on the flight across the ocean..I know my Dad was. He's like, super nervous about it. My Mom though...heh...she's just anxious to get there. I'm sure they'll be fine though. In other news in my life, Mark is still grounded. I guess I should explain this too...it's not all too interesting though....all he did was get two C's on his report card and his oh-so-overprotective Dad went nuclear on him..so he's been grounded for two weeks now. Kinda harsh for two C's, huh? I know I'd be grounded for two C's, but probably not for two whole weeks. We've only gotten to talk for about fifteen minutes a day..which is <STRONG>way</STRONG> less than usual. And...I don't know if Renae (my best friend) made Danceline or not....I think she was really good, but probably not..she didn't call me last night so, I imagine she didn't make it. Only a month and eight days until my grandparents move. I know it sounds terrible, but I'm really excited! We've lived with them for about eight years now...ever since my Dad got transfered here. We lived upstairs, and they lived downstairs..but in a month (and eight days...) we're buying the house from them! And I am finally getting my own room! I'm so excited. But for right now, that's who's ""watching"" us...my grandparents while my Mom and Dad is at Puerto Rico. Even though I'm the one watching my two sisters and little brother. So...yeah. Well, even though there are a few other things I'd like to mention..this is probably way too long anyway.</P>

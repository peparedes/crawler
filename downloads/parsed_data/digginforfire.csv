<P><EM>YOU WOULD KILL FOR THIS, JUST A LITTLE BIT, YOU WOULD KILL FOR THIS, YOU WOULD, YOU WOULD. </EM>Oh,&nbsp;I would.</P>
<P>Of course, I nearly did kill for it, but with someone else. And it was worth it.&nbsp;A&nbsp;night away, a night to spend in glorious, angst-filled freedom.&nbsp;A night to spend in someone else's bed, in someone else's arms, in someone else's darkness...oh, it was worth it. <EM>to be used...</EM></P>
<P>No point in going on, is there?</P>
<P>(and yes, sorry about being such a bitch the other night, you're right. I'll stop.)</P></DIV>

"event","I love you. I love your scent on my skin. I love waking up though I have not slept. I love the way you heighten my awareness. I love your words, echoing through my mind hours after they've been said. I love your eyes, searching my own for permission you can't find. I love your hands, anxious, anxious, anxious, always reaching and holding and moving restlessly to new places to perch. I love the way you linger with me when you've left again, cinnamon left on my skin. I love the way you don't ask any more- you know. I love the sweet command you take now you know. I love yearning for you, I love wanting you, I love needing you, I just wish that those feelings we're returned (although some are, just not the ones I want most, you know what I'm talking about, sorry, I'm just being needy again.) Tonight I do not want your words. Tonight, I do not want your voice or your eyes or any part of you which cannot touch me in the ways you like and I need. Tonight I want you here with me, beside me, right now. Tonight I want what you want, what I tried so hard to persuade you into, not that agreement then would do anything for me now. Tonight I want this apartment to be empty and I want your arms to be full. 

Yeeeeaaa, wishful thinking there. Just, pretend I didn't say that stuff. (errrrrrrrhemmmm, I hear what Kiley was saying earlier.)"

"event","""he rolled over in the bed, the grey sheets sticking to the sweat in the small of his back. felt for the jeans under the bed, grabbed a pack of cigarettes, pulled one out and stuck it loosely in the corner of his mouth. flicked the lighter open several times, at last producing a weak orange flame, and burrowed the cigarette into the fire. inhaled deeply and coughed slightly at the smoke, sighed and swung his legs out of the creaking bed. his vertebrae pushed up through the skin in escape as he pulled on the ripped jeans. he sat for a moment on the edge of the bed, watching the maroon hotel curtains shiver from the heat vent beneath. then he watched his feet, toes curling under, and forced himself to get up and go to the bathroom. there he stared at the tile walls, impervious and beautifully stained. back out to the room, pausing a moment to glance at the prone figure in the bed. she wasn't even pretty. she wasn't anything to him. he shrugged subconciously and pushed a heavy hand through his dark hair. grabbed his shirt and yanked it down over his head, thrusting his wallet into the back pocket of his jeans. ""i'm leaving,"" he said. ""i'll pay on my way out."" she made no response, didn't even move, and he took it as permission to leave. he unlocked the deadbolt, threw back the chain, and felt rather than heard the door grind open beneath his touch. slipped outside into the blackness, and let the door grind shut again and lock with a miniscule click. he sighed again, and leaned against the wall. looking up at the sky, and the stars, with a blank expression and unseeing eyes, he knew he would never speak to her again. would probably never see her again. he shuffled down the walk to the front office, wondering when his credit card would expire. i wonder, he thought, how i came to this.

she felt the bed lurch as he rolled over. she hated how he smoked continually, as though no natural high could ever compete with the chemical joy of nicotine. she stared at the ceiling, tried to count how many bumps and ridges there were. wondered if there was a mathematical way to find out, and decided she would be too dumb to complete it if there was. her stomach clenched, as though trying to force memories out of her canvassed body. she placed sympathetic hands on her abdomen, running them over her smooth belly. she hated herself. she fell a little to the left as he got up, pulling his jeans on one leg at a time. her toes clenched under the sheets, listening to his body move and skin grate against itself. he left her lying there, hands pressed against her stomach, and she heard him in the bathroom. she tried to relax her tense legs, tried to persuade her stomach to stop belying her pain, without result. she lay there hard and stiff, waiting for life to happen to her. he wandered back into the room and offered to pay for the room. she couldn't justify their sex with a reply, couldn't justify her life with movement. he pulled his life back into him, completing the abandonment, and wandered out of her life. she heard the lock click quietly behind him. she knew she would never see him again. she crawled aching out of bed, forcing abused limbs and a complaining torso into compliance. turned the shower on and sat down in the bottom of the tub, letting the brackish water crush the breath out of her, letting it cleanse every pore of her body. turned the heat up till it almost burned. sitting there watching the bruises form on her thighs, she wondered, almost, how she had come to this.""

Baaaaaah. I'm sick of this Tag. I'm sorry for everything I've done to you, all the shit I've put you through. I'm sorry I'm such a flirt, I'm sorry I'm so goddamn needy. I never meant to hurt you, I didn't mean to cause all this shit. Sorry doesn't fix any thing now though. Last night, I was sitting there thinking. Thinking how I always complain because I can't get the one thing I want most. And how very selfish that is of me, I act like I've been through so much. But I haven't, yeah, I've been hurt over and over again, but nothing really major until Matt. And that's about it. I had a decent childhood, decent family, decent friends. While you on the other hand, from everything I heard, you didn't have any of that. And you don't get everything you want, you don't get the one thing you want most, but you don't go around complaining about it. I understand now, why you get depressed like this so often. (I think..) With everything that's been done to you, everything you've had to put up with, and then trying to act happy constantly, that would take a toll on anybody. That's not the way anybody wants to live their life. I can see it in your eyes, the way you look at the people who have hurt you, the ones who have used you, it's not anger though. I'm not sure what it is exactly. But there's so much you have to put up with everyday, I don't know how you do it. Between me and Kiley and all those other people, I'm surprised you haven't completely snapped yet. I love you so much, I couldn't ever tell you how much. The hardest thing to do is see you when you're hurt, and know I caused it. I just want you to know that I never meant to hurt you, I didn't mean to do this to you. I'm sorry, for everything."

"event","Running through a string of friends, running through a string of boys isn't enough any more. I know I'm the problem, I just don't see where I go wrong. I pick them up easily enough. a million people in school, in different colleges, in different states, who I met in band or speech and debate or student congress or anything like that, a million people will say that I'm nice, or easy to talk to, or anything else. But that's not good enough any more. Being myself isn't good enough. Something's missing and it's got to be me. Why do revolting people that I know have that one constant that I'm missing? How do detestable, reproachable people have two best friends and a steady boyfriend? And how do I always begin with so much hope, and end up so alone...?

I don't like myself any more. I'm so used to being alone that, now, I choose to be alone. So used to being forced to introversion that now, I'm introverted. I don't like myself any more.

Fuuuuuck. Sebs, I'm glad you're still here. You know I'd be lost without you. I'm sorry for all this shit with Kiley, she can really be a bitch sometimes. I love you kiddo."

It's still pretty good, we need to finish the music to it though. At the part ""painful thoughts erupt into euphoric dreams"" we should have a huge change in the music, like in that one VAST song, where it's all calm in the verses and all the sudden it's like BOOM! You know? whooooo, I need caffiene. AHHHH! You're awake, I'll shut up now."

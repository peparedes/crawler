"event","<P>so heres the link for about THEVENT since i doubt yall actually want to read it..</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""thevent""> ok so we left the temple friday at 12.. we were on the bus with the kids from greensboro. we watched 10 things i hate about you, oceans 11, and we started clueless but didnt finish it because we got to VIRGINIA! ee so we all went into the temple.. dang that place is HUGE. but anyways we first had meet n greet type of thing.. then we had mixers where we all went around to different rooms and talked about different topics. it was tons of fun. then we had dinner.. it was so good. after that we went to services. the youth group there had a band were they did all the songs/prayers. they did awesome. then we went back and changed. and had our subregional meeting where we learned the COOLEST song ever.ill have to get the lyrics from dana it rocks. so anyways then around 11 our host families were there and we met them and went back. they were really nice.. i stayed with dana (woohoo!) but boy those dogs they had were mighty friendly. haha and we went to sleep around 12 or so..</P>
<P>then on saturday we had to wake up SO early.. ah i slept probably only like 6 hours. not enough for me. we had breakfast at their house then we went to the temple. we went to morning services.. except they were run by the youth group at the temple. we had a bunch of rotations through-out the day and a subregional meeting again in the morning. then we had lunch and song session.then we went back to our host homes for the afternoon. we went for a walk w/ the girls who lived at the house. dang it was so freakin cold in virginia.. im so glad we live in the south. haha and so then we had dinner.. and we had to go back to temple at 630. once we got there we had havdalah.. and during that the kiss pass it on. haha then we pretty much got started off with COLOR WARS. they were so much fun.. and im so freakin proud of dana for winning limbo! i knew all those times she won at the bar/bat mtizvahs would come in handy sometime. haha so after the color wars we had the dance.. wow i love high schoolers. haha especially erin.. she was so nice to us all weekend long. and the dance ended around 1130 when we went back to the host homes. we had ice cream then went to sleep.. </P>
<P>and TODAY.. we woke up fairly early again,&nbsp;packed all of our stuff up,&nbsp;went straight to temple, had breakfast there, had the friendship circle.and then left :-( the bus ride was nice.. i slept most of the way.. we stopped for lunch at wendys then watched sweet home alabama. and then we came HOME. now that im back i really miss everyone.. haha i know it was kinda awkward at times since most of them were seniors and all knew each other.. but it still was a great experience and i really reccomend it to yall at tbo.. spring kallah or the southern sleepover is both open to 8th graders. :-) ill go if you go!</P>
<P>oh and thevent next year is GONNA ROCK because its at TBO!! yayyy</P>

The stars are coming out in waves
And I miss my Miss America from Park Hotel
But I'm too stoned to call it a day

When everything you wanted 
Is hard to hide behind your lies
And I'm locked in my hotel room 
Turning over our goodbyes

I will write this down for you
So you can read it
I will hold my breath for you

Another lonely night in Amsterdam
The water's moving through the sound
The blood is boiling in my veins
and the food I can't keep down

And I don't care if you don't love me
And I don't care if you don't change
And I could live inside the shadow that I cast for you
If it meant that you would stay
And I'll be home before the morning comes,
You won't have to be alone

I will write this down for you
So you can read it
I will hold my breath for you
Till I can't feel it
You don't have to see me this way,

Oh love, when does this twisting end?
When does this twisting end?

"event","wow its been like a week or something.. 
ok well the computers been broken on and off so sometimes it will work and others it wont.. but hopefully its fixed for good.
so friday was the dance.. highly interesting i must say. so after that i went  back to brittanys w/ laura, kristie and kala.. we had a great time. haha i love those girls so much. i would explain everything but yall wouldnt get half of it and plus it would take wayy too long. but me and laura had a very interesting conversation w/ the boys.. lol ask if you want to know.. ((but i wouldnt..)) so we went to sleep like 430 and woke up around 10.. i think. i was too tired to look at the time. so then my mom and i went to a few places.. and i fell asleep in the car. once i got home (it was 4 by then) i just wnet upstairs and slept more. woke up aroun 730.. got up for about 15 mins and went back to sleep. i didnt wake up until 830 this morning for sunday school. but then my mom was telling me that last night around 1230 she was downstairs and i came downstairs and turned on the radio and started dancing around the kitchen for 15 minutes straight. then turned it off and pulled a bunch of things out of the pantry and mixed them all together and then stuck it in the oven. then just went back upstairs and went to sleep.. how strange is that? and i REALLY dont remember doing that.. must have been sleepwalking.. creepy.. 

so today.. went to sunday school..had fun there.. with my lovely friends... haha then we had music.. but we only sang one song which sucked. so after that i went out to lunch w/ my mom.. we chatted for a bit then came back and got joe, rearranged moms room around, came home, did my valentines, did some boxtops, and now im here.. but im gettin ready to go to my homework that i put off all weekend and eat dinner/more boxtops..etc.

singles awareness day tomorrow.. def. looking forward to that.. not. but im def. taking danans rules and putting them into consideration
rules for valentine's day [if you're single]:
1. do not make eye contact with anyone associated 
    with a current boyfriend or girlfriend.
2. move to classes quickly and swiftly- avoiding the
    couples in the hall exchanging presents.
3. don`t wear the colors red or pink, and absolutely
    nothing associated with hearts.
4. if things get too unbearable, don`t worry. just call
    your parents and fake sick. always works, kids.
5. dont come to school the whole week, because it
    would avoid the pre and/or post valentines day crap
^wow i love her.. and she certainly knows what shes talking about.

20. Do you think our friendship is getting stronger/weaker/or staying the same?
21. Do you think that I am stubborn?
22. Are you going to put this on your livejournal and see what I say about you?
23. Have you ever liked me as more than a friend?
24. What do you think im going to be when I grow up?
25. Ask me one question.. anything; and I'll answer it honestly.

so then i had to go wait for joe outside.. (dont know why.. hes capable of walking from the street into the house.. only like 15 ft. or whatever) so i went outside and played tennis against the side of the house for about an hour.. (once joe came home too) while listening to music. then my dad came home and yelled at me for throwing tennis balls at the side of the house after we just got the house repainted like 3 months ago.. whoops. so then i came inside.. worked on my homework.. well all but science.. i cant find my science book.. i have NO clue where it is.. so im still looking for it. hopefully ill find it. i dont really feel like copying someone elses homework down.. i know, odd.

"event","ok well this morning i was so tired while getting up for sunday school.. but i mangaged. mrs a's story is so sad... im surprised i havent started crying yet. but ah its too early in the morning for me so sometimes i start to zone out and i cant stand that. i try really hard to listen because i know shes doing all this for US to know what the holocaust was like but dang its hard. 
so anyways.. we had our board meeting today.. we didnt really have that much to discuss. but thats good i guess.. i just wish we had more than one event each month.. even just coming to the youth lounge and hanging out together would be enough for me. 
so then i came home and had a quick lunch because i had to go over to the francis' to babysit. kevin fell asleep and grant watched tv the whole time so i just pretty much sat there.
so after that i came home, talked online for a bit.. oh god something happened.. n i guess ill write a seperate entry for that cuz i dont feel like writting a ton right now. then i just took a shower.. gotta let my hair dry some then go get my hair all ready for tomorrow.. 
i love you guys

"event","Yeah, so I spent most of yesterday near Albany, New York, in a cave 30 feet below ground. I've decided that spelunking is one of the most wonderful things to do in this world, and I intend to pursue it as much as I possibly can. My god am I glad I'm not claustrophobic. There were points when I was crawling on my stomach with about 4 or 5 inches of clearance on either side of my body. Other times I was up to my waist in water with the ceiling just a few inches overhead. There were natural deposits of clay and this penicillin-producing mineral everywhere, and all sorts of little cave bats, one of which I got to play with. The tunnel we were in ended in a goonies-style natural rock slide into an incredibly deep pool of water. It was absolutely insane, and the most beautiful thing I think I've ever seen.

In other news, I'm a mammalogist. That's right, a mammalogist. I'm spending the year studying tropical mammals and their transport vectors, how they affect biodiversity and things like that. I'm learning about trapping, tranquilizing, collaring, tracking with radio tellemetry, etc... all of which I'll be doing in Costa Rica in the spring. 

Two thirds of all species on earth live in the rain forest, which only covers 2% of the earth's surface. 90% of all medicinal drugs come from the rainforest. It also starts all of the world's weather patterns. Once trees are cleared from the rain forest, the soil they were once in has three years before it becomes completely infertile and useless even for the cattle ranches they try to fill the space with. And, interestingly enough, even though it had little to do with my field of study, 75% of the entire animal kingdom is made up of beetles.

Brief update:
Fairly relaxing summer working at home, full-time job cleaning pools, part-time job registering people to vote. (<i>Do it</i>)

Car crash, midsummer, no-one harmed, car totalled, been driving a massive green SUV ever since.

Never really made any trips aside from one to Cincinnati, and then another to Cincinnati with a crazy detour to Miami to visit Gary, which was followed (on the same day) by a trip with Gary back to Cincinnati to King's Island, where the rides were sweet, the lines were only quasi-ridiculous, and it only rained a hell of a lot on us at the end of the day. That same day I dropped Gary off at Miami and then went back to Cincinnati.. I drive too much.

Wisdom teeth taken out about a week and a half ago, bad news, gaping holes in my jaw. When it happens to you, don't get knocked out. Getting numbed is cheaper, faster, and it really doesn't hurt at all. It did get a little weird when the doctor started pounding at my lower jaw with a mallet and chisel while I watched though. Mmm.. Vicodin.

My family's moving over to Crescent Ridge (the big unit houses over near the Kroger on Main, on that little back street off of Parkview), so these last two days are probably the last two I'll ever spend in this house. next time I'm home I'll either be staying in a temporary apartment with my parents, or helping them move from their apartment to the new house. Their contract says they have to be out of here in about five weeks, and the house isn't nearly done, boooo. The new house is gonna be really cool though, which is good news. Unfortunately the trampoline will fall to the wayside, the staple of my social life for nearly the last decade, gone. *grumble*

In other news, I go back to school in two days, that'll be alright, no-one's here to play anymore anyway."

"event","So my buddy Jake and I are on the kayaking bus on the way back from the river, and we're all talking about the food we want to bring along when we camp by the river at our next race in Vermont. So, naturally, Jake suggests the blood of a virgin in copper goblets and the smallest member of our team, Andrew Carter.  We start discussing the various ways we could prepare Carter, Carter kabobs, Carter jerky, some pulled Carter, smoked Carter, etc.. all while eyeing him hungrily.  We actually did this to the point that he wasn't entirely sure if we were going to eat him or not. This conversation went on for an unnaturally long time, and it eventually led to each of us asking who on campus we would or wouldn't eat should the situation arise. The conversation then led to Jake saying the funniest thing I've heard in a long while, because we were on the topic of eating humans over dogs: ""I wouldn't eat Snoopy, but I'd eat Woodstock just to piss Snoopy off."" I'd already been laughing, but at that point I nearly vomited.
Good vibes."

Well, I guess things got better, I think what I needed was for winter to end, I've actually been outside and kayaking the last couple days, granted it's still 45 degrees outside, so I only swam for a little bit.
Now that the hackey sack season's back, I've been using that as an excuse to go out and mingle, because <i>everyone</i> loves hackey sack, and if they can't play it they enjoy watching it. It's an entertaining way to mingle, and that's what I've been doing..
Sort of.
I talked to Ryan Wolfenbarger yesterday, it was pretty weird. He IMed me wondering who I was, and as soon as I told him he promptly apologized for his episode at me last year (we haven't talked since then, until now), so that was kinda cool.
Then I IMed Kelly, and apologized to her for my episode at her five months ago. We talked for a little bit, then I had a date with the hackey sacks just like every other night at 9:30. I hope we start talking again, she's cool.
I'm at school until May 29th, but then it's summer, and that's really not a long time at all, especially because the weather'll hopefully be luscious and I'll have whitewater slalom races half of the weekends between now and then.
Fahkinaye.. I should really be writing a ten-minute speech about Carbon's function for my Chem class next period..

Gary and I went to BD's Mongolian Barbeque, which is the greatest place ever. <i>EVER</i>.
Dinner was going lusciously as usual, I'd had two rather large servings, as had Gary, and then all of a sudden our waiter came out of left field as he'd done at least once every three minutes since we'd sat down (the service there is impeccable). He asked his usual questions, ""how is everything?"" ""can I take that for you?"" ""need another soda?"" ""can I get you anything else?"" and so forth. So I asked him how much a Mini Genghis (a smallish peach cobbler with ice cream in a sundae glass) was.
""$3.99,"" he said. ""But if it were your birthday I could give you one for free, is it your birthday?""
""'Fraid not,"" I said.
""Are you sure it's not your birthday?""
""I can tell you it's my birthday...""
""It's your birthday? What do you want?""
""Uhm.. a Mini Genghis.""
""It'll be right out.""
That guy was so awesome.
Later, I was ridiculously full, so I asked the waiter if'n he wanted some of my Mini Genghis. He said: ""oh no, I couldn't possibly, it's your birthday!""
Heh, woo."

"event","I think I've got life block.
It's sort of like writer's block, only it applies to the whole of my existence, and it's only for this week, the pivotal point of this school term. I can't think, I can't write, I have no inspiration, I can't make any new music, I'm just a lump of Zakness.
Now, I have three lab reports I need to do by Thursday, I have a test to make up, a thing to do for my english class, pre-calc homework which is baffling the hell out of me, finals to study for and wow... I'm actually worrying over school.
This probably would not be so if whether or not I get to see Cameron at the end of March were not riding on the completion of these things.
I must be off to skip another ridiculous extracurricular ""school bonding activity"" to do work. I dunno which of my options is worse..
Well, that's that."

"event","""...he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about ... like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.""

The Great Gatsby is such a luscious book. This quote from it was too wonderful to not post, regardless of its wholly pessimistic tone."

"event","I've decided that my math teacher is officially the coolest person to have in class. He makes math no different from sitting around with a bunch of guys being vulgar anywhere outside of school. Here are some things he's said to students, all joking, of course:

""I don't give a rat's ass about your freedom, or your needs.""

""Alright Alex, kiss my ass.""

Student - ""You could just round down.""
Mr. Orton - ""I could also make you bleed.""

Student - ""I can't see that.""
Mr. Orton - ""Tough shit.""

Student - *Something attempting to sound intelligent*
Mr. Orton - ""You're still a retard.""

And I'm fairly sure that, at some point during Pre-calc the other day, someone said this to him:
""<i>You</i> decay exponentially!"" Which is the coolest.
Period."

"event","13 days and I'm home again, I love it.
I know I just got here, but I'm gonna pick this journal up where I left off on my melodramatic.com page, don't be alarmed.
Things have actually been going better lately, I think I've finally learned to deal with all of the people at my school. They haven't gotten any better, I think I've just become accustomed to them.
I'm getting along better with the people I've befriended, simply because I've realized how ridiculous it was to spend all of my time in a state of complete, bitter scorn of my surroundings and ceased doing so.
I haven't been listening to nearly enough Jethro Tull lately, I've just picked up the habit again. This music brings me back, makes me feel nostalgic and happy all at once.
Good vibes."

"event","It has been a very long week.  There is tons of reading to do, and it is difficult just getting all of it done in time for my next class.  On Wed. I was so angry at the unreasonable amounts of work assigned by my Civil Procedure professor that I had to take a break to eat dinner at 8 just so that I wouldn't pull out my hair.  Unfortunately I have Civ Pro everyday except for Monday, so I better get used to his tons of work quickly.  I have two classes on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, four on Wednesday (this is a very long day on campus) and one class on Friday.  I was  very stressed and rather unhappy Tuesday and Wed during the day, but it got better wed and thursday night when I was done with the majority of my classes.  I have 5 classes:  Civ Pro, Criminal Procedure, Torts (These are all with the same section...I'm in section 2), Legal Writing, and Legal Research.  

Now at least I have a better idea of what each class will be like, and have started conforming my briefs (summaries  of the stuff I have to read before class) to focus more on what the professor will probably try and ask us.  Well see how that goes with my classes next week.  I went to an activities fair yesterday and signed up for a bunch of stuff there is no way I'm going to have time to do.  I also signed up for a law fraternity...I think that I will join that as a networking/tool to meet new people. 

My parents are actually visiting today.  They arrived yesterday after my class and took me to the movies (Brothers Grimm) and dinner.  The movie was really bad.  I highly DON'T recommend it.  They spent the night but will leave here today sometime this afternoon so that I can get going with the tons of work I have for next week.  I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to compile all the information I will need to eventually study.  As of now the class I am having the most difficulty with is Civil Procedure so last night I spent time typing up my class notes...maybe that is something I can do every week to go over stuff.  I don't know :-P.  We'll see when my slacker mentality comes in full force.

Well I should probably get going.  Sorry I don't have anything more interesting to talk about.  Though...to quote the girl I sit next to in Civ Pro:
""That guy really bothers me.  He talks just to hear himself speak.  I don't like people like that.""
My response:
""We're in law school.  I think that's the norm.""

I hope everyone has a great weekend!"

"event","So I'm finally giving in and actually posting something....



hmmm....



Well, yesterday and today I had midterms that involved essays.  Usually I am one of the last people to finish my test, but at Medieval Europe midterm I reached new lows.  The professor walked in and began turning off the lights to let us dedicated students know that time was up.  We kept writing.  He turns off the other set of lights and people begin giving up...but not me.  A few brave souls (myself included) continued writing as he walked to the back and began closing the windows--blocking our last source of light.  I would not give in to his demands, I kept writing until I was the lone person in the room.  It was just him and myself (and the class that would be coming in next).  He approached me slowly and stood over me, blocking what little light was left.  ""Give it up,"" he says and I see his hand reach for the paper and I hunched over protectively (sometimes it comes in handy being left-handed--my arm was blocking him).  I plead for 2 more sentences, but he says one in a stern voice and threatens me with possible revenge by Japanese students (who were still waiting for the remainder of my class to leave).  Finally I give up, my concentration totally broken by the professor leaning over my head.  As soon as I wasn't blocking him, the Professor quickly grabbed my test and then walked away.  




This time almost compares to the Blow out last year when I went to turn in a paper but then begged the professor for another half an hour.  He was holding one side of the paper and I the other.  Too bad the Japanese class that was waiting for me to leave was his."

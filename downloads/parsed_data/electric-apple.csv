Fandom: Cycling
Pairing: Alexandre Vinokourov/Jan Ullrich
Rating: PG
Disclaimer: This is not at all real, none of it. These events didn't happen to my knowledge. It's almost all speculation (and a bit of my own bitterness toward the whole situation).
Notes: For the epiphany challenge. .

<lj-cut text=""This Is The Future"">---

He's spent so much time telling reporters, so much time convincing Erik and Cadel, so much time with Jan that he's beginning to believe everything he says. He stands out on the balcony of some hotel and finds himself imagining the tour. Thinking about that maillot jaune and how much he wants it. Not just for himself -- but for the team, for his team, and for Kazachstan.

He thinks he can do it. He can win this year -- he's got a plan and he can read Lance. He has faith in his team, faith in the boys -- even if they're not always there. He leans against the railing, the metal cool against his hands. He can feel that this is the year. He knows what he can do -- what his team can do. He shuts his eyes and lets himself get swept away by strategy, running scenarios through his mind.

The sliding glass doors are jarred, creaking and startling him into reality. His eyes snap open and he turns. One of his teammates is leaning against the glass, facing away from him -- talking and laughing. He stares into the room, past the smiling faces and he sees Jan, head bent, deep in discussion. For some unknown reason Jan looks up and meets Alexandre's gaze. He smiles slightly before returning to his conversation.

It is that look -- the smile -- that reminds Alexandre why he's happy to have Jan back on the team. It reminds him of all the work he's put in convincing the others that this year will be it. But the smile fades from his memory as he keeps watching. Jan turns toward the rest of the team, they look at him, almost enraptured. Jan talks and they all listen.

And Alexandre is struck with the realization -- the feeling he'd been ignoring, that this was not his team. Maybe it never was, but he thinks with sudden bitterness, now it will never be. He knows he's not worth ten million dollars -- that he's just ""the Russian"" to so many. But he thought he'd proved something last year.

He stands, feeling like a kid with his face pressed up against the glasses, spying on his elders, even though he's backed up against the railing, far from the doors. He stands, watching his future pass him by.

It could have been his year.

And when Jan looks up, looks at him, Alexandre ducks his head away, turning toward the city.

It won't be his year.

Later, after they've all gone back to their own rooms, after the party and the talking, he retreats back to the balcony. He stares without really seeing. And when Jan comes out, light from the hotel room illuminating them, Alexandre can only pretend to be happy. He wants to put everything behind him. He wants to believe this is his -- not Jan's year. But he can't.

Jan's hands on him, fingers kneading at his shoulders. It makes Alexandre want to fold in on himself. But he won't. Instead he'll turn and let Jan kiss him, because they're teammates now."

Fandom: Cycling RPS
Pairing: Alessandro Petacchi/Erik Zabel
Rating: PG
Summary: Sitting on a bench, pretending.
Disclaimer: I lie. I have no idea if this happened. I don't actually care if it did. It's none of my business. I write because it's fun.
Notes: For the 'non-alcoholic beverages' challenge. Written in 30 minutes. For Katie. Here are some visual aids: Alessandro, Erik, the two of them (Erik is in white and red, Alessandro is in blue and white). 

<lj-cut text=""Pretend"">---

He doesn't say anything, just tosses the water bottle at Erik. He opens his bottle, cradling the cap between two fingers as he drinks. He watches Erik, looking for something -- anything. Erik opens his bottle and drinks half of it, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. Then he looks at Alessandro and gives him a slight nod.

He sits, several inches from Erik. They don't talk, just drink. Erik finishes first, tossing his bottle from hand to hand. Alessandro watches out of the corner of his eye as he slowly drinks the rest of his water. He looks around and, seeing no one nearby, tosses the bottle toward a nearby trashcan. He misses -- the bottle rolls back toward his feet -- and for a moment he thinks Erik might have laughed.

But when he looks over, there isn't even a trace of a smile on Erik's face. He sighs and Erik turns, almost opening his mouth. But he doesn't say anything. They never say anything. They don't talk to each other; they don't even talk about each other. That's just the way it is.

Other sprinters, Alessandro thinks, get along. But he and Erik just can't, which makes what they have even stranger. He runs his hand through his hair, and then puts an arm on the back of the bench. His fingers brush against Erik's jersey. They both know it's one of the most intimate touches they'll ever share in public.

He rubs his fingers against the smooth fabric, and when he closes his eyes for a second he can pretend it's Erik's skin under his fingers. The moment fades when he opens his eyes. Erik's watching him, water bottle twirling in one hand.

Later, when they still won't talk, he'll run his fingers through Erik's hair. He'll breathe into Erik's mouth. And what they share will mean more than they'll ever admit. But here, where the world can almost see, they just pretend.

They sit on a bench, away from the throngs of people. They sit on a bench and pretend that they're just two sprinters and nothing more. They sit on that bench with their discarded water bottles and go through the motions."

"event","Title: Pasta as a Metaphor
Author: Sarah
Fandom: Cycling RPS
Pairing: Baden Cooke/Matt Wilson
Rating: PG-13
Disclaimer: Neither boy is mine. This was written for fun. And to my knowledge these events didn't happen.
Notes: For the 'food' challenge. With everything, it took all 45 minutes. As usual, cross posted in [info]peleton. Part of the AZ-universe.

<lj-cut text=""Pasta as a Metaphor"">---

It's warm and sunny for January, especially for the morning. They're both up early, for practice, for the sun, for the long ride they'll do later in the day. Matt stretches, his fingers sliding down his legs, already covered in the smooth fabric of his kit. He can hear Baden in the kitchen; cooking the same meal they'll eat for the next, he doesn't even know how long -- nine, ten months.

Pasta.

When he was little he used to enjoy it. Now it's the food he lives on. If he closes his eyes, he can pretend they're getting ready for the tour again. He can hear the van, the hotel, the hundreds of bowls of pasta he'll eat during the three weeks.

But he doesn't. This is different, because it's not the team. It's just the two of them. Pasta isn't a metaphor for life. It's a metaphor for something else. Team, maybe. He thinks about all the pieces of pasta floating, slowly cooking, in the boiling water. It's like their team. Simmering around the edges without a real leader any more. Ready to explode if the moment's right.

He stands and braces himself against the wall, stretching more. Or maybe it's a metaphor for the way Baden makes him feel. Like one tiny piece of pasta, when Baden touches him, he feels pliable. Slick and smooth. He gives way as Baden's hands slide over his body. It could be a metaphor for the way Baden leaves him on edge, more thoughts of boiling over. A whole new meaning to the word 'simmer.'

He's flat on the floor now, pulling one knee toward him, then the other. It could be a metaphor for lust. He hid in the back of the room as they celebrated the night the tour ended. Until Baden found him, and dragged him onto the dance floor. The music was loud and hard, and they were all drunk. Baden's hand slide down his back, pressing their hips together. He can't think of a pasta image without ruining the moment. But it's there, on the edge of his brain. Two smooth pieces, pressed together, sliding across the dance floor.

He stands again, stretching his arms. Or sex. When he's flat on his back and Baden's hovering above him. Hot and sexy and wet. Sliding across the plate and into his mouth as Baden slides across the bed. As Baden slides into him.

But then it's over. Baden's yelling at him to come eat. So he goes, and as he slowly swallows the pasta, he wonders if maybe he's wrong. Maybe it's not a metaphor at all --just food that gets him through the day. Food that keeps them going day after day, kilometer after kilometer, one push of the pedal after another.

They wash the dishes and Matt thinks that it doesn't really matter. Pasta is just pasta. And Baden is just Baden. And he's just Matt. Pasta is what they eat and Matt is what Baden has. Or maybe he has Baden. Then he's reminded of the pasta, curled around each other in the jar where it's stored. Pushed up against each other like the way he sleeps with Baden.

So maybe it's just a metaphor for them. Which is just fine. Because they're going riding today."

"event","Title: Time To Take A Chance<br />Fandom: Tour De France!RPS<br />Pairing: Tyler Hamilton/Lance Armstrong<br />Rating: PG/PG-13<br />Spoilers: The tour, up to Stage 16.<br />Summary: It's almost too much and he just wants to give in.<br />Disclaimer:  Neither Lance nor Tyler are mine. This, except for the race and the  results, is fiction. I'm almost certain this didn't happen. It's all in  good fun. <br />Notes: While this fic was written for the CLM character development challenge, it was really written for <lj user=""the_oscar_cat""/>. This fic is cross posted at <lj user=""peleton""/>. Also, the title of this fic is form the song &quot;Sleep All Day&quot; by Jason Mraz. Written in about an hour.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Time To Take A Chance"">---<br /><br />It  really hurt to breathe. It hurt to move. It even hurt to think, but the  latter wasn't something he had much control over. He was lying on his  stomach, trying to ignore the pain sliding over his body. He knew it  could end, that he could call someone and take the higher dose and  everything would slide into oblivion. <br /><br />It was hell, just getting  on the bike in the morning. The vibrations were enough to split his  skull. And keeping up? He shook his head as he forced himself to sit up.  He was amazed he was still 7th -- no, he was amazed he was still in the  race. <br /><br />He shifted his weight and jarred his shoulder. Yesterday  he'd reached for a bottle of water and, without realizing what was  happening, he'd pulled at the fracture. Even now it was all he could do  to keep the tears at bay. He'd worked so hard for this month, for July.  For the <i>Tour</i>. And here he was, struggling to get out of bed and onto his bike. <br /><br />Two  and half weeks in and he couldn't decide if he wanted to quit or start  over again. Not that he could redo it, and knowing his luck, he'd fall  again. He looked out the window as he got dressed, taking his time,  trying not to jar things. He'd eat breakfast then visit the doctors.  They'd do tests; make sure he was fit to ride. And he supposed he was,  all things considered. But getting back onto the bike &hellip; His thoughts  trailed off and he shook his head. He hurt and he was tired of riding  through the pain. He was tired of pushing himself harder than everyone  else. Tired of not getting anywhere but stiff mornings and pity. <br /><br />But  mostly he was tired of the pain. He pulled his shirt on and made a  face. He stood, facing the mirror, and looking at himself. He felt 80,  not 32. He felt worn out and alone. He knew the team was supposed to do  great things, that <i>he</i> was supposed to do great things, but he  didn't feel great. He turned away and leaned against the door to the  closet, his face resting against the wood. He closed his eyes and  suddenly saw how things could be if he just stopped now. He could back  out of the race, give up and stop the pain. <br /><br />It was so tempting. He could see himself reaching out. Calling that number. <br /><br />The knock on the door made him jump and he banging into the closet door in his haste to answer. <br /><br />&quot;Damn.&quot;  He muttered, pulling the door open. He was surprised, having expected  to see someone from the CSC team and not, well, not Lance. <br /><br />Lance stepped into the room. &quot;How're you feeling?&quot; He asked.<br /><br />Tyler shrugged. He hated admitting weakness, especially in front of Lance. <br /><br />&quot;Bad?&quot; There was concern in Lance's voice and it made Tyler cringe.<br /><br />But  he found himself nodding. Lance crossed the room and stood in front of  Tyler. He didn't say anything, just stood there, as if reading his mind.  He was staring deep into Tyler's eyes, and Tyler felt that if Lance  asked, he'd bare his soul. He'd stand in the middle of the room and try  not to tell the man he almost wanted to beat that he was thinking of  quitting -- of giving up.<br /><br />Lance reached out and touched his face.  He trailed his fingers from Tyler's temple, across his cheek, and down  his neck, finally resting them on the edge of Tyler's collar. <br /><br />Tyler  felt his stomach churn; he was so close to throwing it all away. He  looked at Lance. &quot;How do you do it?&quot; He asked, his voice almost  breaking. <br /><br />Lance blinked and looked startled, but after a moment he smiled. &quot;It's not really how, it's why.&quot; <br /><br />Tyler gritted his teeth, &quot;Fine, why?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;To  prove that I can.&quot; Lance replied softly. He reached up and cupped  Tyler's cheek in his other hand. &quot;Yesterday. I didn't have a choice. I  had to get back on. I had to win.&quot; <br /><br />Tyler shook his head  slightly. He opened his mouth, then shut it. It was all too much. Too  much pressure, too much pain, too much to prove. He looked away, at the  wall -- the closet, anything that wasn't Lance's understanding gaze. <br /><br />Lance  gently turned Tyler's head back toward him. He leaned in and pressed  his lips against Tyler's. He lingered, and Tyler didn't pull away. He  felt himself sinking, giving in and Lance's tongue slid in and suddenly  they were kissing. And for a moment, an instant, nothing hurt. Then they  both pulled back and Tyler could feel the pain return, sliding through  his system. <br /><br />Lance's fingers were still on Tyler's face, his  neck. Lance leaned in again, and when he spoke, his lips brushed against  Tyler's ear. &quot;Don't give up.&quot; He whispered. An then stepped away from  Tyler, leaving him alone in the middle of the room. <br /><br />He stood,  then took a deep breath. He looked at the phone; he crossed the room and  stared at it. Then it rang. He picked it up, started; it was Bjarne  telling him to get his ass downstairs and get ready to go. Without  thinking, he did, if only out of habit. <br /><br />He struggled though the  warm-ups. He forced himself to do everything they'd talked about the  night before. And finally decided that he wouldn't quit, not yet. But if  he hurt too much, he'd stop. He made a bet with himself. Ride in the  back and give up if he couldn't make it. So he climbed on his bike,  certain he was never going to make it.<br /><br />It started out slowly,  pedaling just to get by. He knew Lance had watched him fall back. He'd  felt Lance's eyes on him, and he wondered if he'd imagined the  disappointment. But it was a bet he'd made with himself. He was so  engrossed with his self-pity that he didn't notice the CSC team drop  back and surround him. He looked at them; he heard their words, telling  him to get moving. He just shook his head, he wasn't ready -- he was  injured, and didn't they see that? <br /><br />But with each push of his  feet against the pedals, he felt himself lighten. His eyes were wide  open, but all he could see was Lance falling and then flying by them  all. He reworked his bet, if he caught up with the pack, and stayed with  them, that was good. If it hurt too much, he'd stop. So he pushed past  his teammates and caught up with the peleton. He rode with them, slowly  gaining. He matched the leaders' pace and turned to glance at Lance. <br /><br />Lance was grinning at him. <br /><br />A litter harder, he told himself. He could hear Lance's words echoing throughout his head. <i>Don't give up</i>.  And then he looked around him -- there were no riders. Just him. He  suddenly worried he'd dropped back again, and then he looked behind. He  could just make out the yellow jersey. He had broken away.<br /><br /><i>I won't give up</i>, he screamed to himself, <i>just watch me</i>.  And he rode on. Faster, pushing as hard as he could, pushing through  the pain. And when it almost got too much, he'd grit his teeth and think  of Lance. <br /><br />He crossed the line in a blur of tears and pain. And  when Lance arms encircled him after the win, the pain didn't matter. All  that mattered was that he did it. That he couldn't have done it without  Lance, and that he did it because of Lance. But, mostly, he did it for  himself. Because he could.</lj-cut>"

Much thanks to <lj user=""collie""/> for making me thing of <i>Newsies</i>, and thanks to everyone who told me to write this. And a very big thanks to <lj user=""gabbyhope""/> for reading this on such short notice. I used to write <i>Newsies</i>  fanfiction (in 1997 - and it was almost all mary-sue), and I hope this  makes up for those awful stories I used to write. Written in (hopefully)  45 minutes (with interruptions due to being sick).<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Sunrise"">---<br /><br />He  tosses and turns. The mattress isn't usually comfortable, and tonight  it's keeping him up. He pushes the ragged blanket away and slides off  the bunk, trying not to wake anyone. He quietly shuts the door behind  him and slips silently down the hallway. He stops in front of a window  and stares for a moment. Then, with a deep breath, he pushes the window  up and climbs out onto the fire escape, he gently slides the window  down, making sure to leave it open, just enough so he can get back in.  He climbs up the ladder toward the roof. It creaks, just once, and he  holds his breath. He's not sure he wants company. <br /><br />The moon is  still out, but only just. He stares across the city, his city, he  pretends. It must have rained, because everything seems to shine in the  moonlight. He pads across the roof, ignoring the dirt gathering on his  feet. He's seen worse. He finds a spot on the edge of the roof and sits,  legs dangling. <br /><br />He gazes around him, enjoying the almost silence  of the morning. He watches people hurrying to get to work, and he  wonders if that will ever be him. Not getting ready to sell papers, but  putting on a suit and going into some building early in the morning. He  shakes his head and sighs. He looks away, trying to find something else  to stare at, something happier. <br /><br />There's nothing. He stares off,  watching the sun slowly climb into the sky. Life as a newsboy isn't  anything to be proud of, it's hard and he doesn't really like it. He  wants something more from life, but he knows that he'll die like he  lives. On the streets. He squeezes his eyes shut, so tight he can see  his own stars. He takes a deep breath, and it comes out choked, almost  like a sob. <br /><br />&quot;Mush? You okay?&quot; <br /><br />He nearly falls off the roof. He turns his head, &quot;Blink.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;M'sorry.&quot; Blink says and reaches out a hand, pulling Mush back from the edge. <br /><br />&quot;What're you doin' up here?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I heard you.&quot; Blink hasn't taken his hand off Mush's shoulder. <br /><br />&quot;Sorry.&quot; He replies, and turns around to face his friend. His toes curl against the edge of the wall he's sitting on.<br /><br />Blink shrugs, &quot;Couldn't sleep?&quot; He asks, hand falling to his side. <br /><br />Mush shakes his head. <br /><br />&quot;Me neither.&quot; <br /><br />Mush  stares for a moment, just looking at his friend. He can't remember a  time, even though he knows it existed, when he didn't know Blink. And  he'd always had that patch over his eye. Mush bites his lip; he can't  stop staring. <br /><br />Blink turns red, and Mush ducks his head. &quot;What?&quot; Blink asks.<br /><br />&quot;Nothin'.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;You were starin'.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sorry.&quot;<br /><br />Blink laughs, &quot;You haven't stared in a while.&quot; He takes a step and sits down next to Mush, their bodies barely touching. <br /><br />Mush's  face is red, and he moves, legs dangling off the edge again. &quot;Came up  here to watch the sunrise,&quot; He states. Then adds, &quot;Be alone.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Alone?&quot; <br /><br />He  nods and turns to look at Blink again. He hadn't realized he'd spoke  aloud. He doesn't answer, and instead lowers his gaze, studying Blink's  face again. He's lean and hard. For a moment Mush wonders what he would  have looked like if their lives had been different. The thought fades  quickly when Blink catches his eye.<br /><br />&quot;Starin' again?&quot; <br /><br />Mush just grins, trying to mask the shy smile. He turns away; he hopes the sun will cover the blush rising on his face. <br /><br />&quot;You never asked.&quot; Blink states.<br /><br />Without thinking, Mush turns his head with a jerk. &quot;What?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;About this.&quot; He gestures to the patch over his eye. <br /><br />&quot;Thought you'd tell me someday.&quot; <br /><br />Blink  nods and tilts his head slightly. &quot;Now's as good as any, I suppose.&quot; He  takes a deep breath and looks out over the city for a moment, then back  to Mush. &quot;There's really nothin' to tell. I've always had it. Since I  was little.&quot; <br /><br />Mush opens his mouth, but can't come up with anything to say.<br /><br />&quot;Somethin' happened. I mean, when I was born. Could never see right out that eye.&quot; He says, voice low. <br /><br />&quot;So, you're ...&quot; He can't finish his question out loud. Blink can't see. He'd never considered that. <br /><br />&quot;Blind in one eye.&quot; Blink answers and turns toward Mush. &quot;Can't miss what I don't know.&quot;<br /><br />Mush  nods, more to himself than at Blink. He stares again, then, without  really thinking, he reaches out and traces the patch with his finger. He  expects Blink to push his hand away, but nothing happens. He traces the  skin around the patch. He fingers the edge, then meets Blink's eye. <br /><br />&quot;Can I?&quot; He asks, voice soft.<br /><br />Blink nods, his eye follows the arm, then he goes back to watching Mush. <br /><br />Mush  slips his finger under the edge of the patch and gently lifts it up. It  slides off easily and falls into his hand. The leather is soft and  worn; he lets it dangle from his fingers for a moment, before looking  back up. Blink looks different with both eyes visible. Mush transfers  the patch to his other hand, then reaches out and traces the outline of  where the patch was pressed against Blink's face. The skin is red and  raw, as if the patch was trying to grow into the skin. Blink's eye looks  almost normal, except it never focuses on him. Mush feels himself flush  again, as if he's been caught staring again and is embarrassed. <br /><br />Blink  reaches out and grabs Mush's hand, the one holding the patch. He twines  his fingers with the strap of the patch, and Mush's fingers. <br /><br />Mush can't pull his gaze away. &quot;Why me?&quot; He asks, even though that's not the real question. <br /><br />Blink closes his eyes for a moment, &quot;Why not?&quot; <br /><br />Mush traces the side of Blink's face with his thumb. <br /><br />Blink  turns his face toward Mush's hand; he licks his lips and his tongue  brushes Mush's thumb. He opens his eyes. &quot;It's almost over.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Sunrise?&quot; Mush asks, his hand slides down Blink's face and rests on his neck. <br /><br />&quot;This.&quot; He gestures to the lodging house, the city. <br /><br />Mush gets it. He nods. &quot;Couldn't sleep.&quot; He says, quietly. <br /><br />Blink nods.<br /><br />Mush  slides his fingers around to the back of Blink's neck. He brings their  heads together. It hurts his eyes to keep them open when they're so  close, but he can't shut them. &quot;What're your plans ... For after?&quot;<br /><br />Blink shrugs, and rests his forehead against Mush's. &quot;You?<br /><br />&quot;Nothin'.&quot; Mush whispers, his hand falls from Blink's neck. It rests on his friend's leg. <br /><br />&quot;We could go west.&quot; Blink offers.<br /><br />&quot;We?&quot; Mush's eyes grow wide, he pulls back a bit. <br /><br />Blink nods. &quot;You an' me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Why me?&quot; He asks again, even though he already knows. After all, he thinks, they are best friends. <br /><br />&quot;'Cause.&quot;  Blink replies, then slips his hand around Mush's head and presses his  fingers lightly against the base of Mush's neck. &quot;This. Us.&quot; He  whispers, and then kisses Mush. <br /><br />After a moment Blink pulls back. <br /><br />Mush  stares, then smiles slowly. &quot;Us.&quot; He replies, then watches as Blink  moves to put the patch back on. &quot;Wait.&quot; He says, and lifts his hand, he  presses his fingers to the side of Blink's face, holding him still. He  takes it in, staring, remembering. Then, ignoring how it might seem to  someone watching, he leans forward and presses his lips against Blink's  eye. He sits back.<br /><br />Blink flashes him a smile and then replaces the patch. His hand slides back into Mush's as he turns toward the sunrise. <br /><br />Mush  squeezes Blinks hand, and stares. In the morning sun, the city almost  glows. The work is hard, and he still hates it. But maybe not  everything's so unhappy.</lj-cut>"

Summary: It's a private moment.
Disclaimer: The characters belong to JKR and Warner Brothers.
Notes: Written for the voyeur challenge. For Jordan, because they always are.

<lj-cut text=""Private"">---

Even watching him feels like being a voyeur. It shouldn't matter, because it's not like they don't spend every day together. Because, he reminds himself, it's not like he hasn't seen him naked, jacking off, or whatever. And, he thinks, they've fucked -- more than once, more often than not. But it doesn't stop him from feeling like a voyeur.

He stands in the doorway -- watching, waiting. He doesn't know why he doesn't just go in. It's been hours since the Ministry men left, hours since Roger's been sitting there -- not moving, barely breathing. But he doesn't go in, he can't bring himself to walk those few steps.

It's a private moment, a private moment that's turned into three hours of avoiding. Three hours of trying to convince himself that it's okay to walk over to that couch, To walk over to the couch and run a hand through Roger's hair. To sit next him and touch his arm, let him know that it'll be fine.

But he can't. Because he feels like he's intruding -- interrupting. And that's so unlike him, so unusual, that he's still standing there. Watching.

Until Roger turns around and Marcus sees the pain and the hurt. The loss mixed with abandon and loneliness. He takes a few steps and he's there. He sits next to Roger, resting his hand on top of Roger's.

They don't talk; he doesn't lie and say things will be fine. He still feels like a voyeur, but he doesn't mind so much now."

<i>He doesn't know what Roger sees in him. Why Roger stays around, sleeps in his bed, loves him.</i>

---

&quot;I love you,&quot; Roger had said. 

Marcus had stared at Roger. &quot;I don't love.&quot; He'd said, voice barley audible. 

&quot;I know.&quot; Roger had said, softly. He'd crossed the room and sat on the couch next to Marcus.

&quot;Then how can you?&quot; He'd asked, avoiding Roger's gaze. 

Roger  had reached out and touched Marcus's face, tilting his head toward him.  &quot;Just because you don't love me doesn't mean you can't.&quot; 

Marcus  had looked away, unable to mean Roger's eyes. Later that night, when  they were almost asleep, he kissed Roger with his eyes closed. 

---

<i>He doesn't love because he never knew love. He never knew it until Roger. And now he wants to love him.</i>

---

They  sit on the couch again. Marcus's hand covers Roger's. He turns,  studying Roger's profile. It he could love -- he banishes that thought.  But before he can stop himself, he opens his mouth. 

&quot;I don't deserve your love.&quot; 

Roger looks at Marcus. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I do not deserve what I can't return.&quot; He forces himself to look at Roger.

&quot;I don't care.&quot; Roger replies.

Marcus blinks and looks away. Later when they're lying in bed, Roger rolls over and Marcus kisses him with his eyes closed. 

---

<i>He doesn't love Roger, but he would die for him. He would give up his whole existence for Roger.</i>

---

The day will come when Marcus will be forced to choose between Roger and his destiny. 

The day will come when Marcus will have to give up everything he'd been trained for. 

The day will come when Marcus will sit on that couch next to Roger and tell him his final choice. 

And that night, when they're trying to figure out their future, Marcus will kiss Roger with his eyes open.

<i>He  still doesn't know why Roger loves him. But it doesn't matter, because  Roger loves him; because he'd give up everything for Roger.</i>"

Fandom: 2003 MTV RW/RR Battles of the Sexes
Pairing: Shane/Antoine
Rating: PG-13
Spoilers: Up through episode 16
Summary: This is the last day together ...
Disclaimer: These boys are not mine. Most of the events didn't happen. The song doesn't belong to me, either.
Notes: Apparently two fics weren't enough. I had to write more. Written for Jordan and Katie.
Song: The Last Song by The All-American Rejects. Lyrics here

<lj-cut text=""You'll Find a Way Somehow"">---

Antoine clutches the Ion in his hands. He knows what he's going to do and he knows why. And he knows, much to his chagrin, exactly what's going to happen. They didn't even have to talk about it.

So why is he so upset when Shane gives it back to him?

Because he'll miss Shane. The way they talked and cheered each other on. He'll miss their friendship. But, he thinks as they're hugging, face pressed against Shane's shoulder, it's more than just friendship.

It's not love and he'll probably see Shane again. Maybe invite him to Vail and Cancun. But it still hurts. And Shane still has to go. And he has to stay, and maybe he can win it all. For Shane.

But for now it's the end. And Shane will go back to Hugh. But the offer will be open. The unspoken offer, the looks exchanged.

He clenches his hands in fists as the van with Shane pulls away. And he hopes that this isn't the last time he'll see him. He hopes that they'll figure things out. He hopes that somehow it'll work and one day he'll wake up in Shane's arms.

He hopes that somehow things will work out. And as Shane waves to him, he can wonders if Shane's thinking the same thing."

Fandom: RPS
Pairing: Clay Aiken/Sondre Lerche
Rating: PG-13/Light R
Summary: That's how he'll remember him.
Disclaimer: They are really, really, not mine and this is definitely not true. I'm almost certain Clay doesn't know who Sondre is. Sondre's been touring in US, so I like to think that he might know who Clay is.
Notes: Don't ask. I mean, really, don't. It's far too complicated and weird. You can download Sondre's songs off of Kazaa and visit his website. I highly recommend his music. Also, I don't know if he thinks in English or Norwegian, but of course, I don't know Norwegian, so English it is. Written in about 30 minutes for the complementary colors challenge.

<lj-cut text=""memories in pink and blue"">---

He thinks that the next time he sees Clay that he's going to be dressed a lot nicer. He's going to wear clean trousers and a pressed shirt. He's not going to be sweaty and wearing whatever he just sang in.

And he's right.

The next time he sees Clay, he's wearing pajamas. There's a knock on his hotel room, in some city he can't remember, and when he opens it, in his simple gray pajamas, he almost stops breathing.

On the other side of the door is Clay.

He has to remind his heart to beat, his lungs to work. When the door shuts and Clay's kissing him, he thinks that he doesn't have to remind himself how to do this. He's kissing, pushing at Clay's shirt, wanting to touch skin. And then his pajama top falls to the ground on top of Clay's t-shirt. They're bodies are pressed together and Sondre's not thinking about anything except how never expected this to be the next time he saw Clay.

Later, when he's curled up in Clay's arms, he thinks about the two of them. He thinks of himself in blues, bright and soft light blues. Like the colors of his website. He thinks of Clay in terms of pale pinks; the way his own face looked the first time they kissed.

He thinks about how different they are, how Clay's so famous. Famous in ways Sondre will never be, never really wants to be. And then he thinks about when he leaves the States it'll probably be over.

But he'll always have those memories in blue and pink."

Disclaimer: Not mine, not real, etc.
Notes: Carson plays fo rthe Bengals and Jordan plays for University Of Texas At El Paso.

Carson calls because he's supposed to.
Carson calls because he can't be there.
Carson calls because he watched the game. He watched and he saw that last quarter.

He calls because he loves his brother.

He calls because he isn't there. He calls and it's not enough. He calls and he can hear the ache in Jordan's voice. The way his words break off when he's upset, the way his sentences are clipped. The way Carson doesn't have to see to know Jordan is silently crying.

He fills Jordan's head with promises. With words of love and how things'll work out and this happened for a reason. He talks until he knows Jordan's stopped crying. He talks longer, babbling about nothing, about his next game, about Jordan's classes. He talks until he runs out of things. He talks until his voice is raw.

He knows it doesn't help. He knew it wouldn't. It couldn't.

But, when he hangs up the phone, he knows Jordan will sleep a little bit better. And that's almost enough.

Almost."

---

When he was fourteen, he got sick. It was nothing, just the flu, but his parents were out of town and Peyton was the only one at home. It was a few years before Peyton went pro, before he left Eli.

Eli had spent hours trying not to let Peyton know he was sick. Didn't want to ruin Peyton's plans for their empty house. He knew how much his brother had been looking forward to the weekend.

But it was too hard to hide.

Peyton found him hunched over the toilet puking his guts out. He'd canceled the party and spend the night taking care of Eli. He hadn't even laughed when Eli hurt so much he cried.

After he'd stopped throwing up. After the fever reduced, Peyton helped Eli into clean pajamas and down the hall. Peyton's room was always neat.

Peyton had pushed back the covers and Eli crawled into Peyton's bed, only half-surprised when Peyton had followed him.

He didn't remember falling asleep, but he woke up curled around Peyton. And then he knew, somehow, that things had changed."

<lj-cut text=""Glimpse of the Future"">---

Easy as phone calls, Eli thinks. His brother throws, passes and it's easier than calling him. Watching Peyton, if he gets the chance, is nothing like phone calls. Nothing like the long pauses and meaningless conversations.

Not that talking about football is necessarily meaningless, but most of his life is -- has been -- spent that way.

He liked a break.

Peyton never gives him one.

Even their emails are filled with football. It's tiresome. When they were little, he could always count on Peyton to distract him. But not now.

Peyton has become something else, like their father. Obsessed and Eli wonders if that's his future, too. He doesn't want that, but he doesn't think he can escape it. At least, not as long as he keeps calling Peyton. IF he stopped, maybe.

But he won't. He loves his brother too much.

So he sits and watches. Peyton on his TV is smiling and grinning. Eli almost wishes he'd been there. But he wasn't and so it's surreal, almost unreal. The Peyton on his TV is the Peyton who exists now. Not the boy whose bed he'd crawl into when thunderstorms were too loud. When his parents fought. When one of them got hurt on the field. The Peyton on Eli's TV is a stranger.

Except he sees himself. The way he'll be.

His life is Peyton's, only without the glory."

Fandom: <i>SWAT</i> RPS
Pairing: Colin Farrell/Jeremy Renner
Rating: PG
Disclaimer: All I know is that they're good friends and drink together. Everything else is fiction. No money is being made.
Notes: For <a href=http://endless_fever.livejournal.com>Diane</a>. Written in less than 45 minutes for the couch challenge. Cross posted in <lj comm=contrelamontre>.

<lj-cut text=""Sometimes"">---

Sometimes they don't talk. Colin sits on one end of the couch; feet tucked under him, drinking beer and flipping channels. Jeremy finds himself on the other end, feet pressed up against Colin's ass, drinking beer and pretending to read -- whatever happens to be around. The paper, a book, most often, though, magazines. 

He doesn't really understand how Colin ended up on his couch. Well, the mechanics he understands. Walking, sitting, all that he gets. It's the fact that sometimes he'll wake up and Colin's still there. Sleeping, drinking, whatever. And he just goes about his day, oddly comforted in the fact that Colin's taking good care of his couch. 

Until he stops and starts thinking about it. Because it's really fucking weird. He knows Colin's his best friend. But they're sort of living together, if the pile of Colin's clothes he washed yesterday is an indication of cohabitation. Not that he minded, washing the clothes. But it was weird, finding pants that weren't his, in his basket. 

And then he found himself thinking that next time Colin would have to wash the clothes, because he's done in three weeks in a row. But then Colin paid for dinner and whatever it was they did after. He can only drink so much before he's under the table and Colin's laughing. And everything was just fine.

But that really doesn't explain why Colin's sitting on his couch, drinking and watching TV. 

He reaches down for his own beer and looks over the top of his <I>Sports Illustrated</I>. He stares at Colin and wonders what he's thinking. He doesn't really care what's on the TV, except to file it away for future reference. What he cares about, because he's finally given in and admitted that he cares, is the fact that he's so happy Colin looks comfortable on their -- his -- couch. 

Colin shifts and downs the rest of his beer. He looks over at Jeremy and grins. ""Want another?"" He asks.

Jeremy shakes his head and watches Colin pulls himself off the couch. He stretches out, pretending to read that magazine again. But he's thinking about their friendship, and when it changed from 'friends who drink' to 'friends who drink and hang out' and then finally to 'friends who drink and hang out and live together."" Sometimes they don't talk, which is okay with Jeremy. But sometimes they do talk. And that's okay too. It's what might happen next that he wonders about.

But he doesn't find out, because Colin's back. He lifts up Jeremy's feet and slides under them, letting them rest on his knees. He sips his new beer and starts talking about whatever's on TV. And Jeremy finds he has to pay attention, so he tosses the magazine on the floor. And that moment he was lost in before just disappears."

He's exhausted. His eyes flutter shut -- if he can just concentrate, he'll be asleep in seconds. But the door bangs open and Sandy comes running into the room.

""Did you hear?"" Sandy shouts, propelling himself toward Dennys. He forces his eyes open, he can barely focus. ""What?"" He asks, the word slow on his tongue. His eyes slide shut again.

He hears Sandy's voice, not as clear as before -- muffled by the sleep that's just out of reach. He hears words, ""college"" and ""acceptance,"" and maybe ""letter."" And some part of him is overjoyed because they've both gotten into college. But all he can do is yawn and mumble.

""Unicorns?"" He hears Sandy ask, loudly.

He forces an eye open, ""Wha?"" He says, word cut off by a yawn.

He hears Sandy tell him he was talking about unicorns. He thinks, 'he?' then he realizes Sandy means himself, not Sandy. He's tired and confused and he thinks he ought to tell Sandy that he sees them -- unicorns -- when he's this tired. But he can't even muster up the energy to keep his eyes open, much less talk. He opens his mouth and hope he says ""G'way. Sleep."" But he's not sure.

Then he feels Sandy moving around, close to him. And he thinks he must have been hearing things, because Sandy's still there. And then the room goes quiet. He starts to drift off and he sees a unicorn behind his eyelids.

He's almost asleep when he feels something -- Sandy -- curling around him. Sandy nuzzles his neck, and the last thing he remembers, even after the unicorn, is Sandy.

""I see them too."" Sandy whispers, lips hot on his skin.

And then he's asleep."

The house was quiet -- they'd been left home alone again. They don't mind, especially when it's winter. The hot chocolate had been moved to the kitchen and both boys were grateful.

Sandy put the water on and watched as Dennys went about fixing the mugs. Eventually the water boiled and he poured it, filling their mugs nearly to the brim. They took their mugs into the living room.

""Read?"" Dennys asked, blowing on his mug, watching the steam rise.

Sandy nodded and settled onto the couch.

Dennys sprinted to their room and returned shortly with two books. He handed one to Sandy and then sat on the couch, leaning against his brother.

They read until the chocolate was gone.

Sandy yawned. ""Do you think they'll be home soon?"" He asked.

Dennys shrugged, setting his book down.

Sandy pushed Dennys away from him and took both their empty mugs to the kitchen. He returned to the living room and grabbed his book. Dennys looks at him and then took his own book and followed Sandy to their room.

""You think they're having fun?"" He asked.

Sandy laughed, ""They're shopping again.""

He watched as Sandy changed into pajamas and he soon changed too. Sandy crawled into his bunk and watched Dennys.

""Will we live together?"" He asked quietly, breaking the silence.

Dennys looked up from his pile of dirty clothes. ""At school?""

""Whenever. Always."" Sandy's arms were crossed, resting above the covers and on his chest.

Dennys thinks for a moment, ""Do you want to?

""Yes."" He said, without giving it a second thought.

Dennys smiles slightly, ""We're just like the rest of our family, then.""

Sandy looks at his brother, ""Not normal.""

Dennys nods. ""I wonder why."" He laughs and pushes the cover back, uncovering Sandy.

Sandy moves over, letting Dennys climb in with him. ""I hope we do."" He whispers in Denny's hair.

""We will."" Dennys says, pulling Sandy's arms, and the blankets, around him."

The room is hot and Sandy's tired of sweating. He slips his shirt off and tosses it on the floor. He angles the fan at his bunk and lies down. He's almost asleep when Dennys stumbles into the room. Sandy watches Dennys slip of his clothes: shirt and pants.

""Hot."" Sandy says, lazily.

Dennys turns, ""Extremely."" He walks in front of Sandy, blocking the fan.

""Blocking the fan."" Sandy says, slightly annoyed.

""I know."" He walks toward the bed, stopping at the edge.

Sandy reaches out and grabs Dennys hand. He pulls his brother toward him.

Dennys sits on the edge of the bed, watching Sandy.

""Are they gone?""

""Out.""

Sandy smiles and tugs at the waistband of Dennys' boxers.

Dennys moves closer to Sandy, ""It's not too hot?"" He murmurs.

""Not for us."" Sandy says as his fingers slide along Dennys' skin.

Dennys shifts so he's almost hovering over Sandy. Sandy's fingers slide down his brother's chest and he pushes the boxers down. Dennys gasps slightly when Sandy's fingers touch him. He sits up, head angled away from the springs on the top bunk, and pulls at Sandy's pants. Sandy lifts his hips and then they're both naked.

Dennys lowers himself on top of Sandy, they're bodies pressed together and already slick with sweat. They've done this before, when it was just as hot - and when it's been cold. But not recently. Sandy slides against his brother, their bodies touching. Friction making him gasp and arch.

Dennys leans down and kisses Sandy, lips insistent. The kiss is deep and Sandy thinks that it might make him come right there. But it doesn't and so he kisses Dennys back, sliding his tongue inside his brother's mouth. They move faster, bodies pressed and arching against each other.

Sandy comes panting, his brother's name is on his lips. Dennys comes a few seconds after, gasping Sandy's name.

They lie there, sticky and hot. Too tired to move. To comfortable to move. Together."

They're lying in bed together, just the two of them. The house is quiet, empty. Christmas vacation has begun and they haven't seen each other in weeks. The family is out shopping, leaving them -- as always -- to their own devices. Only now they're both old enough to know better.

Instead of exploring, taking a walk, or ever doing work for their classes next semester, they lie in bed.

Sandy's hand covers Dennys, their fingers entwined. He wants to roll over and kiss Dennys. He wants to feel his brother move against - with -- him. He wants to be able to gasp his brother's name when he comes. And he knows Dennys wants the same.

But neither of them move. They're in limbo. Waiting for the right moment to let it all go. It's not time, they both know it. They need to get used to each other again. To remember. Each time it takes a little longer and the fear it won't happen again almost outweighs the desire -- the need. But it will happen, this time.

So they wait."

He see everything, their future. And he knows with an unwavering certainty that it's the future. He sees crashing and fire and flashing lights. And from a safe distance he watches the world end. He watches everything fall apart, and then he watches them, his family - Lucy, Peter, his parents, even Eustace. He finds that they're all there with him. Safe and alive. Then he watches the other people, swirling around him, they're not quite there, slowly some of ascend, at least that's how it feels, with him. Then he watches the rest, including Susan, disappear.

He reaches out for her, trying to grab her hand and bring her with him, but his hands pass through her. He turns, stricken, to his brother, toward Eustace and they just smile. He tried to yell, tell them what's going on, but nothing comes out. And then Eustace's fingers grasp his and he slides into calmness, the fear and fury just on the edges of his mind. As Eustace tugs him closer, he tries to remember what he was upset about, and for a brief moment he sees the crash again then it's gone and he can't remember.

Then suddenly he's awake. He's sitting in bed, wearing only his pajama bottoms. He gulps in air and then rubs his eyes. He looks around him, eyes adjusting to the darkness. He remembers where he is and he looks down and sees Eustace sleeping next to him. He reaches out and brushes his fingers against skin, fingers trailing down Eustace's spine. Eustace stirs and Edmund's fingers freeze, but Eustace doesn't wake. Edmund breathes a sigh of relief; he's not ready to share his dream just yet.

He sinks back into bed, pulling the covers around him, and then curls up next to Eustace. He slides his arm around Eustace, and in his sleep, Eustace tugs Edmund's arm tight around him, and laces his fingers with Edmund's. For a moment Edmund wonders if Eustace is a wake, but the gentle sleep-sigh tells him otherwise.

Edmund closes his eyes and tries to erase the fiery wreck from his mind. He pictures a house, a big white house with three bathrooms and six bedrooms. He forces his mind to envision Eustace in the kitchen, cooking. He pretends that he's in the other room, folding laundry or cleaning, or something. This is the future he wants, the future he needs.

He feels sleep pushing at the edges and he tries to ignore it a little longer. He pretends he can see Eustace crawling into bed and he watches himself tumble after. He can almost hear his own laughter. But then he feels himself yawn. He tries pushing the nightmare away, but it's right there, forcefully persistent. And as he falls asleep, he tightens his arm around Eustace, hoping that this time it'll end differently."

Cor watches his brother carefully, trying to learn.

""You're watching me again."" Corin says, turning around. He's wearing only his trousers.

Cor's face flushes red. ""I'm sorry."" He's already dressed in his pajamas.

Corin laughs and sits on the bed. ""What are you expecting to see?""

Cor shakes his head, ""Not see. Learn."" He bites his lip and pulls his knees up to his chest.

""Learn what?"" Corns asks, shifting so he's facing his brother.

""I'm going to be king, aren't I?""

Corin nods.

""I should learn to behave as such."" Cor doesn't look at Corin.

""Aravis doesn't seem to care.""

Cor glares at his brother, ""It's not about her.""

Corin sighs, ""Then what is it about?""

He runs a hand through his hair and looks at Corin. ""I am not a king. I will never be.""

Corin reaches out and grabs Cor's hand, sliding his fingers along Cor's knuckles.

""I don't want to be."" His voice is quiet.

Corin's voice catches. ""You haven't any choice.""

Cor raises his gaze and looks at Corin. ""Everything will change, you know.""

Corin moves closer, ""You'll be a king and I'll still be a prince.""

""Isn't that what you wanted?"" Cor asks, sliding his fingers between Corin's.

Corin signs, ""Of course."" He wants to say something more, but he doesn't.

Cor pulls his brother toward him, ""But that's not what you -- we -- meant."" He states.

Corin nods, gently touches Cor's face. ""We'll make do.""

Cor turns his head slightly, lips brushing Corin's hand.

Corin pushes Cor back onto the bed and crawls across it, lying down next to his brother. They curl around each other and sleep."

With a blanket wrapped around him, Edmund watches the snow fall. He remembers his first visit to Narnia. He can see Lucy, running in the snow. And for the first time he's hit with more guilt that he can ever remember feeling. He stares out the window and tries to forget the witch and how poorly he treated Lucy, and later Peter and Susan. He's so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't hear the knock or the eventual creak of the door opening.

Eustace stares at Edmund, trying to figure out what he's doing. He wants to cross the room, as what's wrong, but he doesn't. He just watches.

Edmund finally sees Eustace's reflection in the window. He doesn't turn around. ""The first time I went to Narnia I was simply awful.""

Eustace doesn't know how to answer. So he just nods and wonders if Edmund has more to say.

He does. ""I betrayed those closest to me."" He says, pulling his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around them, blanket falling to the floor.

Eustace sucks in a breath, then crosses the room. He sits on the window seat, next to Edmund.

Edmund doesn't look at Eustace. ""You weren't the only one."" He finally says, quietly.

Eustace moves closer, fingers brushing Edmund's hand.

Edmund grabs Eustace's hand and laces their fingers together. They sit there, watching the snow. The two of them, changed forever."

He trails his fingers along Eustace's skin. He doesn't remember when it began. He thinks it might have happened on his last visit, the second visit that was the last. On the island. That moment they shared.

But now they're older and things have changed. He sees Eustace more often then Peter and Susan, and even Lucy. They only mentioned it once, when Eustace said he'd gone back again, a few years earlier. Edmund had remembered thinking that Lucy would have been pleased to hear that, but he'd never told her.

Eustace's lips on his skin distract him. He's reminded of how much his cousin has changed. How much he himself had changed. How much time has passed. How they've grown up. Shared things, lives.

But he'll always remember Narnia. Because, no matter how much things have changed, they'll always that that moment.

Eustace asks him what he's thinking. Edmund tells him he's remembering things past and times gone by. And Eustace looks at him and says he remembers and oh, how times have changed. Edmund nods and then says that they've grown, they're different.

Eustace looks at him, pressing his lips to Edmund's throat and whispers that they'll always have that moment. They'll always have this. And they'll always have each other. Because, though things change, they'll go through it together."

He'd always known that Edmund loved Peter more. But he always thought it was a brother thing. So he'd convinced himself that it was something more ... Something deeper, something special.

But now he knows he was just kidding himself. Just pretending.

---

He sits across the room, watching Peter watch Edmund tell some story. Neither of them are listening to Edmund, but that doesn't really matter, they rarely ever do. Eustace watches the way Peter's eyes focus on different parts of Edmund's body. His hands first, then the curve of his shoulder. And then Eustace has to stop watching, because he'll end up jealous.

And, as Lucy likes to tell him, jealousy isn't very becoming on him. So instead he remembers. He closes his eyes and thinks about the way Edmund's eyes glow when he's excited. The way the sun makes his hair shimmer. The way the moon shines off of Edmund's body when they're both lying outside, naked.

And then he realizes that he can't remember the last time he saw Edmund naked. The last time he felt Edmund touch him. And he curses himself for getting lost in his memories. So he opens his eyes and the first thing he sees is Peter's hand on Edmund's shoulder.

He can feel his heart break, but not so much that anyone would notice. Until he looks at Edmund.

---

Edmund has always loved Peter.

And Eustace has to accept that, to move on with his life. But he can't, because there's no where to go. If things were different -- if they were different, he could be with Edmund and Peter would be off at school. But things aren't different, and he can't even end his own misery.

So he just sits across the room, watching. And pretend that they had something more. Something special."

He hated him. For coming in and being Jack's new boy. The favorite. He hated him for being prettier, and more stylish, than him. He hated him for being everything he isn't. For being everything he almost wanted to be. But mostly, he hates him for being really fucking smart. And good as his job.

So maybe that's why he's shocked when Martin showed up at his door at three am. Not drunk.

---

A loud pounding on the door shook him out of bed. He stumbled to the door, rubbing his eyes, ""The fuck?"" He peered through the peephole. ""Martin?"" He opened the door.

Martin tumbled in, looking tired and miserable.

""What're you doing here?"" His words were slurred from sleep. He shook his head once, and then noticed Martin was dripping on the floor. ""You're wet.""

Martin shrugged, ""It's raining.""

---

He hated him because he was smart and nice. He wasn't stuck up, at least, not after they'd stopped going after each other. He cared about the people they looked for.

Something, Danny thought, Martin took things too seriously, but then again, they all did.

He thinks that in hating Martin, he developed a crush on him. One of those things you get on the pretty blondes in middle school. And certainly not something you have on your tall, lanky co-workers.

He hates himself because he wants him. And he hates Martin because he can't have him. But he can't explain why Martin ended up at his apartment that night.

---

""Here."" He said, coming out of the bathroom. He had a huge blue towel in his hands.

Martin accepted gratefully and was about to wrap it around himself when Danny grabbed his arm.

""Wait."" He walked into his bedroom and pulled out a pair of jogging pants and a tee shirt. He threw them at Martin. ""Put these on. And I'll throw your clothes in the dryer.""

Martin had nodded again.

Danny wandered into the kitchen and turned on the coffeemaker. He peered around the kitchen wall and saw Martin standing in the middle of his living room, wearing just boxers. He felt the jeans he'd slipped on tighten. He mentally kicked himself. Not here -- not now. Not ever. He turned away and leaned against the side of the refrigerator.

""I'm sorry.""

Danny jumped. ""What?"" Pause. ""For what?""

Martin wouldn't look at him. He handed Danny his clothes.

He took them silently and walked through the kitchen into a smaller room. He stuck the clothes in the dryer, and noted that the boxers were wet also. He turned the dryer on. He walked back into the kitchen and found Martin sitting at the small table.

""What'd you do, fall in a puddle?"" He said, trying for laughter.

Martin shook his head. ""I walked here.""

Danny's mouth fell open for a moment, ""From where?""

Martin shrugged and stood.

Danny's clothes fit and he tried not to stare. ""You're not drunk."" It was a statement, not a question.

""No. I've been ... Nothing. Never mind.""

The coffeemaker sputtered and Danny pulled out two cups. ""Why'd you come here?"" And not Sam's, he added to himself.

""I was in the neighborhood?""

Danny snorted and turned, Martin was giving him a half smile. ""Really.""

""Sam's not my type.""

Danny poured the coffee, he tried not to spill. ""What is your type?""

""Kind of tall, dark hair. Likes coffee and hard work."" Martin laughed.

Danny told himself that his hand wasn't shaking. He slowly turned, and handed Martin the coffee. ""Vivian? I never would have guessed.""

""She's not tall.""

""Can't have everything, can we?""

---

He hated Martin because he always knew. He could almost read Danny's mind. He hated Martin because he was controlled. He was handsome. He was every girl's perfect date.

He hated Martin because he liked Sam. After all, who didn't like Sam? Except she didn't date co-workers.

Not that Danny did, and not that he wanted to. He wanted ... He wanted something more than just Martin. More than a quick fuck in the back room. But he wasn't about to tell anyone that. But then Martin showed up and he confessed things that night that he'd never forgive himself for.

Except that now Martin knew. And somehow, after that cup of coffee. After the hour conversation about boys and school. About cops and working and emotions. Martin had kissed him. Or maybe he'd kissed Martin. But it didn't matter. That kiss had made all the difference.

---

""You like it?"" Martin had asked.

""What? Working for the FBI?"" Danny drained the last of his coffee. ""Wouldn't trade it.""

Martin had just nodded, he still had half his coffee left.

""You?""

""It's better than my other jobs.""

They've covered earlier jobs, girls, boys, school, and everything else and had moved onto work.

""It's harder."" He couldn't resist.

Martin laughed and finished his coffee.

They were both sitting on the couch, facing the TV. It was muted. They watched a recap of the news. Of their latest victory.

""We saved the day."" Martin set his cup down.

Danny smiled. ""Again.""

Martin nodded, he looked at Danny, head tilted slightly.

Danny turned. ""What?""

Martin shrugged. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out.

""Why'd you come here?"" Danny played with loose threads on the couch.

""Why do you hate me?"" Martin looked at a spot over Danny's shoulder.

""What?""

""You ... You're different now, but you used to.""

Danny didn't know what to say. He just stared at Martin, who didn't turn away.

""The problem, Martin. Is that I don't hate you at all."" He'd said, in a low voice. Not sure he was even talking out loud. But Martin had given him an odd look. A surprised look.

Then, somehow, someone -- one of them -- leaned forward and that was it. The kiss was hot and Danny didn't want to stop it. He reached out and slipped his hand under Martin's -- no, his -- shirt. He felt the soft skin he'd seen from the kitchen. He felt his jeans tighten, and then he felt Martin's hand on his chest.

They stopped kiss. But his hands were on Martin, and Martin's were on him.

""You don't hate me."" Martin had said, voice husky.

""No."" Danny had replied, firmly. Of course he didn't hate Martin. He just wanted him. Wanted to fuck him. Wanted to wake up next to him. Wanted all the things that couldn't be. And he hated -- had hated -- himself.

Martin kissed him. He slid his tongue between Danny's lips, feeling his way around. Danny had gasped slightly, and slid his arms around Martin, pulling him. They were kissing and touching and then Martin was on top of Danny. His hand slide between their bodies and he tried to unbutton Danny's jeans. Danny arched and then they were open. Martin's hands slide under the jeans and over Danny's cock. He gasped.

Martin kissed him again. Danny's hands were on Martin's back, and he moved them slowly down Martin's body. He placed both his hands on Martin's ass and pressed Martin to him. They both moved together for a moment, then Martin pulled his hand out. Danny gasped again. Martin slipped his shirt off. Danny watched. Martin pulled the jogging pants off, and then Danny's jeans off. The couch was rough on his ass and he couldn't remember the last time he'd sat on his couch naked. Not that he cared, really.

Martin crawled over Danny, settling himself on top. Their cocks rubbed and Danny's vision swam for a moment. He grabbed Martin's head and pulled him down for a kiss. His other hand rested on Martin's ass, pressing them together. Martin's hands were touching him and he couldn't keep track of everything. He just moved so that they're cocks would touch. They moved slowly, kissing and touching. Then faster. Danny wasn't sure he wanted to do it this way, but he didn't want to stop. Sex, he guessed -- hoped -- would come later. Right then all he wanted was for Martin to touch him, like that. To move against him.

And then sparks and he came, over Martin. And shortly after, Martin came. Shuddering and collapsing on him. Danny's arms were around Martin. Holding him. He wanted to say something, he wasn't sure.

""Why did you come here?"" He finally asked.

Martin lifted his head slightly, ""I wasn't sure.""

""You weren't?"" Danny blinked.

""I am now."" Martin smiled slightly.

Danny stared. And they both had fallen asleep.

He didn't hate Martin. He couldn't hate him. Because he liked him too much. And that's how they'd started this thing. They were certain Jack, Viv, and even Sam, knew. But they didn't stop. It didn't hamper their work.

And at the end of the day, they knew what was bothering the other.

It might not last. But that didn't matter. Because he didn't hate him."

He curls his toes against the hard wood floor and tries to stop feeling like a little kid with a crush. He sinks back into the couch, thinking. He's old enough to know what ethics are and how to behave in the workplace. And he certainly knew what sexual harassment is. But he can't remember if it's considered harassment if it's consensual. He thinks about asking, but decides it would ruin the mood.

""Stop it."" Danny growls.

Martin looks over. ""What?""

""Whatever you're doing, stop."" Danny says, and shifts so he's lying on his back, looking up at Martin.

""I'm reading.""

""You're not."" The folder in Danny's hands now rests his chest.

""I thought you came here to work."" Martin fiddles with the pen in his hand

""Pre-text.""

""To what?"" Martin asks, though he already knew. He tries not to smile.

""Oh, you know."" Danny grins.

Martin throws his pen at Danny and then stands up. ""Let's go."" He says, then stretches.

""Go where?"" Danny flips the pen around his fingers.

""I'm sure the bed is more comfortable than the wood floor."" He holds out a hand.

Danny grabs it, letting Martin pull him up off the floor. ""It's not like we were getting any of this work done.""

""It's not going anywhere.""

""The bed or the work?"" Danny asks, with a sly grin.

""Either, both?""

Danny ponders for a moment, then leans in. He stops, face not even an inch away from Martin's, ""Bed's more appealing.""

Martin's lips brush up against Danny's, ""Than work? Yes."" He almost kisses Danny, but instead he turns. ""Let's go."" He can hear Danny laughing as he walks into the bedroom. He decides it's not sexual harassment. And it doesn't really matter, because they're in his house. And Danny was right; it was all a pre-text to sex."

He knows it should be wrong. He knows that he shouldn't be doing it. Not that the act itself is wrong, but the idea of sleeping with your co-worker is wrong. But then Danny slides in him and it's not wrong at all.

It's -- he knows he sounds like a girl -- beautiful. They've done this so many times that he's lost count. And sometimes it's good, and sometimes it's great. But sometimes, when they're not rushed -- when they go slow and take their time, it's beautiful.

He doesn't believe in love, because if he did, he'd be afraid that he was falling in love with Danny. But he's safe because he doesn't believe in love. Instead he likes the comfort of knowing that it's beautiful. That sometimes it's not that good, and it doesn't matter.

He doesn't wonder if Danny's falling in love with him, because it never crosses his mind. It doesn't even occur to him. He never asks Danny what he likes, because if he doesn't already know, he can figure it out. They don't talk about their relationship. They discuss work, cases, family and friends.

But not each other.

And it never bothers Martin, because it never occurs to him that it should. Because he doesn't believe in love."

Danny finds him after they drive Sam away. He spends exactly one minute asking Martin if he's okay, before moving on to ask about Jack and Sam. Martin pats the breast pocket of his shirt where he'd stashed Sam's ID.

As they stand there, flashing lights illuminating the night, Martin wonders if he could trade his life for Danny's. He looks at Danny, blue lights casting him in a pale glow, and knows that if he had to, he would.

Danny's watching him. ""I would too?""

Martin smiles, ""How do you know?"" He asks, quietly.

""I just do. The same way you knew Jack was going to end up in there."" Danny's voice is low.

Martin nods, the smile now just a faint memory on his lips. He can still see Sam's face. He reaches out and steadies himself on Danny's arm.

For a second their eyes lock and Danny's hand covers Martin's. It's only for a second and then they're back to business. Paperwork, witnesses, and eventual cleanup.

But before they go, Danny leans forward, lips close to Martin's ear. ""Come over after we're don?"" It's half question and half demand.

Martin's near smile returns, ""Yeah."" He says, voice low and rough.

Danny grins and turns, walking toward a group of cops.

Martin watches Danny. He doesn't mind looking forward to spending time with Danny. Spending time with the person he'd trade his life for. And then he hears his own name being called and he turns, back in reality."

He used to go to work wondering if today would be his last day. If today some idiot with a gun has run off. Or maybe he'd have to trade his life for that of some hostage. He didn't used to care; it was all part of the job.

He didn't used to care, until he met Martin.

Sure, they didn't get along at first. Sure, when push came to shove, he'd make sure Martin knew what he thought of his cushioned ass. Until the day someone pointed a gun at Martin. It's not like he was even there, it's not like he even really thought about it, except at three am that morning when he wakes up from a nightmare he can't ever recall.

But now he knows.

After watching Jack trade his life for Sam's. For all of those hostages, really, Danny goes to work differently. He worries, not about himself, not even about Sam or Viv, but about Martin. And it's not something he's proud of and it's not something he'd ever tell Martin. Not even if they were sleeping in the same bed and Martin asked him what his biggest fear was. Danny can't bring himself to admit it, not to Martin and certainly not to himself. The closest he got was that damn comment about the shoes. And for a moment he thought Martin understood.

But nothing changed.

Nothing's changed, he reminds himself every day. He comes to work every day and still wonders if today will be the last day, but not for him. Although he doesn't know what he'd do without Martin."

for the <lj comm=contrelamontre> taste challenge

<lj-cut text=""a safe distance"">---

He stands just out of sight -- around a corner, down the hall, somewhere he can watch. From a safe distance, without being caught. Not that Greg would mind, but sometimes Nick thinks it works out better that way.

The distance avoids any problems, from co-workers, from bosses, from questions. Not that people don't know. Not that people haven't noticed. Greg will smile at Nick in a different way. Nick will bring Greg something to eat, from the break room -- from the store.

But at home -- one of their homes -- things are different. There are touches, intimate moments, things that are avoided at work. But the best thing, at least one of the best things -- one of the things Nick enjoys most, is kissing. He misses it when they're at work.

He'd love to walk into the lab and kiss Greg. He's knows almost what he's taste like -- because sometimes when they both get home late, Greg tastes like work. He tastes like chemicals and cleaning solutions. Like the peppermint gum he chews on the ride home. And now Nick always associates peppermint with Greg.

If he walked in right now, Greg would taste like left over chicken and Pepsi. He'd taste like the DNA lab and latex gloves. And Nick wouldn't mind, because it'd taste like Greg."

He knew in the back of his head that he should visit Greg. He almost asked for a few minutes off -- to run to the hospital, but he didn't. And later he'd curse himself, even though Greg had forgive him.

When he finally did arrive at the hospital, he'd had to shove his way through.

""It wasn't easy,"" he'd told Greg, ""to not tell them I needed to see you. That the man they were 'protecting' was the man I love.""

Greg had smiled, Nick's words drifting through the fog of painkillers and shock.

Nick had reached out and held Greg's hand until he'd fallen asleep. He hadn't let go. He'd just leaned forward, fingers entwined.

When Greg woke again, Nick could see the pain. He let Greg squeeze his hand while they waited for the nurse. As the painkillers slowly lulled Greg to sleep, Nick gently stroked his hand, trying to help him relax.

They'd been through it before. The hospitals, the pain. All the sitting and waiting. But now they'd switched places. And it was Nick's turn. He would be there for Greg, just like Greg was for him. Because he knew what it was like, this second time around."

He watches Greg working. His movements are slow and careful. He doesn't smile, just works his way through the pile of data that's been gathering while he was gone.

He'd only been back a week and Nick wondered if it was too soon. He'd even told Greg, two nights earlier, that maybe he shouldn't go back yet. They were lying in bed and Nick had asked how Greg was. Greg had told him he was fine and Nick had mentioned something about not going back to work. Greg had grunted and rolled away. Nick hadn't bought it, but Greg had been doing a lot of denying and nick hadn't been sure what to do.

But as he watches Greg, he wonders if maybe he should have made more of an effort. Maybe told someone. He notices how Greg's hands are shaking. He watches how Greg closes his hands into fists and he feels his stomach clench, fear and worry filling his head.

Catherine's hand on his shoulder makes him jump. He looks over at her.

""Have you talked to him?""

Nick stares at her, confused. ""About?""

""His hands. Help.""

""How did you know?"" He asks, wondering if he means the hands or their relationship.

Catherine doesn't answer his question. ""You should. He's still scared.""

""I know."" Nick says, almost vehemently.

Catherine turns away from the window. She leans in, ""Take care of him."" She whispers and strides toward Grissom's office.

Nick watches her go and pushes his anger at her out of his mind. He glances at his watch and decides he can take Greg home. He walks toward the make-shift lab, pushing the door open.

Greg's stripping off his gloves, he looks up when Nick enters.

Nick curses himself for ignoring his fears. Greg looks tired; there are bags under his eyes. Nick hates that he sleep so deeply, and as he crosses the room, he promises himself that he'll take better care of Greg. HE stops in front of Greg. He looks down at Greg's shaking hands.

Greg shuffles his feet and lowers his eyes. His fingers clench into fists again.

Nick reaches out and gently grabs Greg's hands. For a moment Greg tires to pull away, but Nick rubs his thumbs over Greg's knuckles. He can feel Greg trying to relax.

Greg raises his eyes up again, meeting Nick's.

Nick keeps rubbing his fingers over Greg's hands. ""Let's go home."" He says, quietly.

For the first time in a week, Greg smiles."

<lj-cut text=""this is what he isn't"">---

Sometimes he wishes he worked for Interpol. That he, like Sydney and Jack, had a higher calling.

But he doesn't and perhaps that's why he finds it so easy to play with Vaughn.

---

Vaughn is in love with Sydney, but after that confrontation in the bank, Sark can't get Vaughn out of his head.

So it's with caution that he first approached him. Slowly, alone and with a proposition -- a lie.

And Vaughn bought it, and then Sark's in.

The sex is phenomenal, especially now that Vaughn isn't just lying there, letting things happen. Sark would like to feel guilty for what he's doing. But he doesn't -- until he takes a moment and watches Vaughn -- his eyes. He sees why Vaughn does it. He sees how much Vaughn loves Sydney and would do anything for her. And then he realizes he can't keep up the lie.

He tells Vaughn the deal's off. And then he leaves.

He'd like to say he did it for the greater good. Because he has some perverse desire to protect Sydney.

But he doesn't.

He's not that kind of man."

""He wants Syd."" Sark growls in Vaughn's ear. ""He doesn't want to kill her."" Beat. ""But he will.""

Vaughn groans. ""You've got her.""

Sark laughs and walks around him, ""I don't want her.""

Vaughn blinks. ""What?""

Sark smiles, but says nothing.

Vaughn struggles against the ropes. He isn't a field agent -- he's not used to getting tied up. ""What do you mean, you don't want her? You just told me ..."" He trails off.

""I told you. Sloan wants her -- dead or alive. Not me."" He pulls out his gun and circles Vaughn again.

""Who do you want?"" Vaughn hisses.

Sark presses the gun to Vaughn's temple. ""You love her, don't you?""

Vaughn sucks in a breath. ""Yes.""

""I bet she's lovely in bed."" He pauses, watching Vaughn. He presses the muzzle of the gun a little harder against Vaughn's temple. ""I take that back. I've seen it."" He enjoys the way Vaughn's eyes grow wide.

""Fuck you."" Vaughn manages to spits out.

Sark laughs again. ""But it's not her I want.""

""You've said."" Vaughn's voice is thin, almost brittle. Sark wonders if he really will break.

""Don't you want to know?"" He asks, tracing down Vaughn's face with the gun. He stops at the side of Vaughn's mouth.

""No."" Vaughn turns his face away.

Sark reaches out and turns Vaughn's face toward him. ""You're lying.""

Vaughn grits his teeth and Sark knows he's won. He slides the gun along Vaughn's lips, but doesn't force it into his mouth. ""You want to know."" He whispers. ""You're dying to know.""

""Fuck you."" Vaughn repeats, but it's weaker this time.

""Just ask."" Sark caresses Vaughn's cheek with the gun.

""No.""

He pushes the gun, hard enough to leave a mark. ""Ask."" He growls.

""No."" Vaughn's resolve was stronger than Sark had thought; he should have known.

He leans in and presses his lips to Vaughn's ear. ""Just. Ask.""

Vaughn swallows. ""Who?""

Sark grins and leans back. He points the gun at Vaughn as he takes one last trip around the room. ""Out of all the CIA agents in all the world ..."" He trails off with a laugh. He stops walking when he's facing Vaughn.

""Who do you want?"" Vaughn growls.

Sark smiles and presses his gun against Vaughn's cheek. He leans in. ""You."" He says and kisses him.

Vaughn's eyes are wide and his mouth is slightly open when Sark pulls back.

Sark raps on the metal door with his gun, the guard comes quickly. Right before the door shuts he flashes Vaughn a satisfied smile."

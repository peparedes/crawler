"event","this summer break has been the best so far. i went to south carolina to visit my grandma for a week in june.&nbsp; i went to jamestown &amp; yorktown for a week in july and i had an absolutely amazing time.&nbsp; i learned so many things and i now have tons of things to take back to my classroom.&nbsp; i went to new york for a weekend.&nbsp; one of my line sisters is going to michigan for law school and that's what we did with her before she leaves.&nbsp; i had a blast.&nbsp; we did the tourist thing and i got to meet up with a friend of mine from high school overseas who i hadn't seen in 10 years.&nbsp; good times.&nbsp; in between all of that i moved from my apartment to my mom's house.&nbsp; the house is still in a bit of disarray, but it's manageable.&nbsp; 

lately i've noticed that i've become a sympathy crier.&nbsp; for example if one of my friends start&nbsp;crying, my eyes to water.&nbsp; also i've noticed that as i watch tv&nbsp;or&nbsp;movies if there's a sad part my eyes will water as well.&nbsp; it's quite&nbsp;weird.&nbsp; i never&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be effected by stuff like that, and i'm not sure why&nbsp;i am now.&nbsp; &nbsp;i'm not sure i like it. 

this summer my finances are tighter than they have been in four years.&nbsp; it's all because of the idiots in payroll.&nbsp; our summer paychecks are 20% less this summer.&nbsp; it's killing me, especially this past paycheck because i had to pay utilities at both the apartment and the house.&nbsp; on top of that i had other bills. i've dipped into my savings several times and it's dwindling faster than i'd like.&nbsp; something's gotta give&nbsp;or i won't have a&nbsp;savings to dip into.&nbsp; money isn't usually an issue for me, but these paychecks being 20% less&nbsp;has really been hard on my finances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
i've been a little down this week.&nbsp; in the past week one of my friends&nbsp;moved into a house, another got engaged, and&nbsp;another got married.&nbsp;&nbsp;it seems that all of my friends are doing new and big things in their lives.&nbsp; i feel kind of stuck.&nbsp; kinda like my friends&nbsp;are passing me by.&nbsp; maybe something new or big will happen for me soon.&nbsp; just maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","it's summer vacation.&nbsp; my favorite time of year.&nbsp; i can stay up&nbsp;late and&nbsp;wake up when i want to.&nbsp; it's great.&nbsp; i know that summer break is in full swing because i keep losing track of the days.&nbsp;gotta love being a teacher.&nbsp;

father's day was&nbsp;on sunday.&nbsp; i could have cared less.&nbsp; i didn't bother calling my father&nbsp; it would have been insincere for me to&nbsp;wish him a happy father's&nbsp;day, so i didn't waste his time or mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;it was back in february that i posted a&nbsp;blog about me calling him on his birthday.&nbsp; he said he'd do i better.&nbsp; i wanted to believe him.&nbsp;i still had hope after being disappointed non-stop for the past&nbsp;25 years.&nbsp;i didn't&nbsp;wanna give up on him.&nbsp; i haven't heard&nbsp;from him since i called in february.&nbsp; i&nbsp;don't do this often, but i give up.&nbsp; i'm&nbsp;done trying with him.&nbsp; he won't get another call from me.&nbsp; it's a shame, but it's the way it's gonna be.&nbsp;&nbsp;

it's&nbsp;official my mom will be moving to south&nbsp;carolina&nbsp;in a couple of weeks.&nbsp; she's already&nbsp;paid the security&nbsp;deposit on an apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;i'll enjoy staying in the house and only paying utilities.&nbsp; i'll get to pay off my credit card and start paying extra on my student loan.&nbsp; i will be able to pay off bills and save money while there.&nbsp;&nbsp;the reason she's moving for awhile&nbsp;is&nbsp;very sad, but it will allow me to really get where i want to be&nbsp;financially.&nbsp;i dread having to pack&nbsp;and move. i have to&nbsp;paint my&nbsp;room&nbsp;before i move back.&nbsp; when i was younger i painted it&nbsp;blue, and not a&nbsp;subtle blue&nbsp;either.&nbsp;&nbsp;as a result i need to paint&nbsp;it a&nbsp;neutral color so&nbsp;it will&nbsp;match my bedroom set and so it looks like an adult lives there and not a middle schooler. &nbsp; &nbsp;

i went to a cookout at a co-worker's house today. everybody there was married and has kids.&nbsp; the person's house we were at was really nice with a nice backyard.&nbsp; it reminded me that i want&nbsp;a husband,&nbsp; a house, and kids.&nbsp; it&nbsp;also reminded me that i don't want kids anytime soon.&nbsp; we were trying to make plans to hang out and they all had to figure out what they were going to do with their child(ren).&nbsp; having kids is a big responsibility and i'm not quite ready for it.&nbsp; i definitely want them, just not&nbsp;soon.&nbsp; i'd like the husband and the house in the near future, but i can wait on the kids.&nbsp; 

i want to go to washington d.c. for a couple of days this summer.&nbsp; i haven't been up there and toured the museums and stuff since i was a kid.&nbsp; i think it'll be fun.&nbsp; now i just have to find someone to go with me, i'm not too fond of the idea of walking around d.c. by myself.&nbsp; 


i anticipate that i will be blogging more often now that it's summer break, and i'll have more free time on my hands.&nbsp; we'll see....&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","my friend kelsey is my new favorite person.&nbsp; she's funny and&nbsp;a blast&nbsp;to hang out with.&nbsp; not only that but she understands things none of my other friends seem to understand about me.&nbsp; she and i were having a conversation about marriage and discovered&nbsp;we both&nbsp;have the desire to be&nbsp;the &quot;stereotypical&quot; wife.&nbsp; we want to cook dinner and keep&nbsp;the house clean for our future husbands.&nbsp; we want to have dinner ready when he gets home and make lunch for the next day and things like that.&nbsp;not because we feel we&nbsp;have to, but because it's&nbsp;want we want to do.&nbsp;none of my other friends can relate.&nbsp; they think i'm crazy and/or old fashioned when i tell them.&nbsp;&nbsp; as we continued our conversation we&nbsp;started talking about how so many women want and expect all of these grand gestures from men.&nbsp; we agreed that we're more of the quality time kind of girls.&nbsp; she and i both agreed&nbsp;one of the main&nbsp;ways a man can show us he cares is by just spending quality time with us.&nbsp; it's comforting having a friend who understands those things about me and wants the same things.&nbsp; the little things are&nbsp;big to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

i gave up coffee for lent.&nbsp; it is proving to be quite hard.&nbsp; i guess that's the point,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;supposed to be a sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

in&nbsp;the month of february three of my&nbsp;friends have gotten engaged.&nbsp; it's an epidemic.&nbsp; it's not surprising since we are at that age.&nbsp; and along those same lines, i have three weddings i have to go to this year.&nbsp; i'm happy for all of them.&nbsp; one day it'll be me.&nbsp; until then, i'll&nbsp;be content&nbsp;being single. =)

so my friends have a habit of not telling me about the things going on in their lives.&nbsp; normally that wouldn't bother me, but they're not telling me things that i think are kind of a big deal. in the past few months i've had friends get engaged, get pregnant, and lose their virginity and none of them told me until months afterward.&nbsp; and these are people i'd consider to be friends,&nbsp; not just associates or acquaintances, a couple of them close friends.&nbsp; what's going on

one of my&nbsp;co-workers&nbsp;is selling her condo so she sent us an email with the link to&nbsp;a virtual tour of her house and it's&nbsp;very nice.&nbsp; it&nbsp;makes me want a&nbsp;house even more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

i really enjoy reading. i wish i had more time&nbsp;to do it during the school year.&nbsp; i always feel like i should be doing something more productive,&nbsp;like grading papers, writing lesson plans, or doing&nbsp;work for&nbsp;grad&nbsp;school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

my&nbsp;assistant principal&nbsp;had really been riding me lately.&nbsp;&nbsp;the social studies benchmark scores weren't as high as she would have liked them, so she's giving me shit about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;i'll admit, there were some low scores, but i do teach social studies to the entire fourth grade.&nbsp; it's kinda&nbsp;hard making sure 96 students get 80% or better.&nbsp;&nbsp;i love history and i love teaching&nbsp;social studies,&nbsp;but i do&nbsp;feel a&nbsp;lot of pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;bleck.

overall life is pretty good.&nbsp; i'm happy as well as content.&nbsp; it's a good feeling.&nbsp; i hope it lasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

sometimes i teeter between action and inaction.&nbsp; not because i'm afraid, but because i'm not sure my actions, whatever they may be at the time, will make any difference.&nbsp; with some people it doesn't matter what you say or do. so do you bother saying it or doing it?&nbsp; do you not even bother because it won't matter or&nbsp;do you say or do it because maybe this time it will?&nbsp; my teetering is often increased because of the responses&nbsp;i receive.&nbsp; sometimes they're positive, sometimes they're negative, and sometimes i don't get a response at all.&nbsp; it's always a gamble.&nbsp; my action or inaction really depends on if i feel lucky.&nbsp; more&nbsp;often than not, i don't.&nbsp;&nbsp;

1.&nbsp; i've recently fallen in love with starbucks. now i see why people are so addicted to it.&nbsp; lately i've definitely become much more of a coffee drinker, so i decided to put the starbucks gift cards i had to use.&nbsp; i've loved each drink that i've gotten.&nbsp; i don't plan on making going to starbucks a habit because it's just too expensive, but as long as i have gift cards i will be partaking in their delightful drinks. 

2.&nbsp; i really enjoy watching the food network.&nbsp; i have watched iron chef a couple of times and i really like it.&nbsp; i enjoy watching people put together all different kinds of food.&nbsp; 

3.&nbsp; i really want to buy a house. but unfortunately i&nbsp;can't afford it on my own&nbsp;right now.&nbsp; that's why i need a husband. haha.&nbsp; on that note, i see&nbsp;why some people get married for financial stability rather than love.&nbsp;&nbsp;call me&nbsp;crazy or old fashioned, but i actually wanna get married for love, not money.&nbsp; although both would be quite nice.&nbsp; 

4.&nbsp; what precisely constitutes a genuine friendship?&nbsp; does it matter if one person is doing most of the contacting?&nbsp;can the friendship truly&nbsp;grow if the friends don't&nbsp;really&nbsp;have meaningful conversation&nbsp;or spend any time together?&nbsp; isn't&nbsp; friendship about getting to know a person and growing closer?&nbsp;&nbsp;can anything be done&nbsp;to change things?&nbsp;&nbsp;

"event","today is thanksgiving. it's a day you're supposed to stop and give thanks for&nbsp;what you have.&nbsp; besides&nbsp;all of the&nbsp;food, it reminds me of valentines day.&nbsp; how you&nbsp;might ask. i'll tell you.&nbsp; both&nbsp;thanksgiving and valentines are&nbsp;days specifically set&nbsp;aside to either give thanks or show&nbsp;the one you love just how special they are.&nbsp; i think that's&nbsp;kind of dumb.&nbsp; you should be thankful on more than just thanksgiving, and you&nbsp; should show the person you love just&nbsp;how special they are to you on more than just&nbsp;valentines&nbsp;day.&nbsp; don't get me wrong, i'm not saying i don't like thanksgiving (i'm not really a fan of valentines day, though), but i think you should show your thanks on more than just&nbsp;the last thursday of november.&nbsp;&nbsp;last year i had a&nbsp;good thanksgiving.&nbsp; my mom came over to my apartment the wednesday before and&nbsp;we stayed up late&nbsp;doing the cooking and baking and such.&nbsp; she spent the night, we woke up the next morning to finish it i up, we relaxed for awhile watched some football, ate, then watched some more football and relaxed.&nbsp; then i went to hang out with a friend, who i don't think i've hung out with since :(&nbsp; we sat&nbsp;on the couch and watched tv.&nbsp;ordinary enough, but i enjoyed myself.&nbsp; this thanksgiving my mom and i stayed up late last night cooking, but only two dishes because a family from our church invited&nbsp;us to thanksgiving dinner (more like lunch, they eat&nbsp;at 1).&nbsp; so we're going to go over there, eat,&nbsp;hang out for awhile then go our seperate ways. i'll probably&nbsp;be home in time to catch some football on tv.&nbsp; at&nbsp;any rate, i am thankful for all that God has given me.&nbsp; From friends, to family, to a career i love.&nbsp;i&nbsp;want to&nbsp;wish you a very&nbsp;happy thanksgiving, and remember give thanks on more than just today.&nbsp; 

happy thanksgiving!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","<p><br />i think i'm getting sick.&nbsp; i've felt like that for about a week now.&nbsp; so at this point i'd just prefer to be sick and get it over with, because this whole i'm on the verge of getting shit is for the birds.&nbsp; <br /><br />i had today off because of veterans' day.&nbsp; i did a bunch of nothing and it was great.&nbsp; i did go to my mom's best friend's house to see if there was anything i wanted because she's moving and giving stuff away.&nbsp; i found quite a few useful things.&nbsp; got something for my roommate too.&nbsp; i had planned to bake today, but i didn't get around to it.&nbsp; i really enjoy baking cookies.&nbsp; it's not because i love eating them, i'm actually not a big fan of sweets.&nbsp; i like baking them because people love to eat them.&nbsp; it's interesting that i've become that cookie person.&nbsp; when i see some people the first thing they ask me is if i have any cookies.&nbsp; i kind of miss the days where i used to bake for&nbsp;a select few&nbsp;select people who enjoyed and showed their appreciation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />there is something freeing about fully and&nbsp;completely forgiving somebody.&nbsp;&nbsp;you can sit back and say, you did this to me or you hurt me in this way,&nbsp;but i care about you way more than i care about harboring this bitterness and resentment i feel toward you&nbsp;so i'm gonna move past it.&nbsp; forgiveness is&nbsp;a process.&nbsp; it starts in your head and has to move to your heart.&nbsp; in forgiving somebody, you&nbsp;have to look past the particular hurtful action(s) and focus on the heart of the person, not just once, but over and over until true forgiveness has taken place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />i started christmas shopping&nbsp;today.&nbsp;&nbsp;it wasn't on purpose, but the store i went to was having a good sale,&nbsp;so i&nbsp;just&nbsp;had to pick up a few things.&nbsp;&nbsp;they're very personal&nbsp;gifts in the fact that they're tailored to the person&nbsp;they're for.&nbsp; i'm not a fan of generic gifts like gift cards, nor am i a fan of useless gifts either.&nbsp; i like to get gifts that fit the personality of the person it's for.&nbsp; i thoroughly enjoy christmas shopping.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />it seems that time is a&nbsp;rarity these days.&nbsp; nobody seems to have it.&nbsp; spending time with&nbsp;some of my friends seems like a thing of&nbsp;the past.&nbsp; it's a shame because i really do look forward to and enjoy spending time with those i care about.&nbsp;</p><p>people can change. it doesn't happen overnight, but it can happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;it starts with small things, and if you know the person well enough, those small things are a big deal.&nbsp; over the past few months i've seen changes take place in someone i know and it's been a&nbsp;beautiful thing.&nbsp; i don't know if the person&nbsp;realized i've noticed these small changes, but i have and it's admirable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />over the past few months i have seen prayer change things.&nbsp; not only has it changed things, but&nbsp;it's changed me.&nbsp; prayer is powerful.&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p><br />yesterday was a rough day.&nbsp; on top of it being long and exhausting, i was an emotional wreck.&nbsp;on about 5 different occasion i found myself on the verge of tears, and twice for no apparent reason.&nbsp; i'm not a crier.&nbsp; emotional, yes, a crier, no.&nbsp; so it was weird to say the least.&nbsp; wednesdays are typically long for me because i work, leave work 15 minutes early to get to class on time, then leave class and go straight to small group.&nbsp;so yesterday being long and busy wasn't out of the norm.&nbsp; i think part of the reason i was so emotional is because i was feeling extremely overwhelmed.&nbsp; it's a lot between the shit that i&nbsp;have to do for work and the shit i have to do for school.&nbsp; and then on top of that i have ministry stuff to do, and try to have some semblance of a social life is a bit much.&nbsp; in other words life is kicking my ass and it was&nbsp;definitely taking its toll on me&nbsp;yesterday.&nbsp; today was better.</p><p>i hate the change of weather.&nbsp; every year the same thing happens when the weather changes.&nbsp; &nbsp;around 7 or 8 my chest starts to get really tight and it gets difficult for me to breathe and i also start to cough.&nbsp; it's&nbsp;kinda annoying.&nbsp;hopefully it'll go away once the weather decides what it's going to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />last year this time i decided&nbsp;i wanted to learn more about&nbsp;football.&nbsp;&nbsp;since then i've learned quite a bit about&nbsp;the sport.&nbsp; i'm nowhere near an expert but&nbsp;i have a general idea of what's going on in the game.&nbsp; in addition to that, i actually enjoy watching football, something i never thought would happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm quite proud of myself.<br /><br />one of my&nbsp;friends gave me a cookie cookbook for my birthday&nbsp;and i'm super excited about it!&nbsp; it has all kinds of recipes and ideas on how to make better cookies.&nbsp; i can't wait to try a new recipe!&nbsp; now&nbsp;all i need is a reason to bake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>the students came back last week.&nbsp; and despite the fact that i was only able to get into my classroom the week before, i got everything done.&nbsp; on top of that i felt better than i had about any other start of the school year.&nbsp; i was also more excited about the upcoming year.&nbsp; i have 94 students, obviously not all at one time.&nbsp; if i haven't mentioned it before i teach social studies to the whole fourth grade.&nbsp; so i have each of the four class for an hour.&nbsp; i really like it thus far.&nbsp; yes, i'm teaching the same thing four times, but the students are different so the dynamic of each class is quite different.&nbsp; something that is also different is that i have inclusion.&nbsp; what that means is that i have to teach special ed kids.&nbsp; it's my first year so learning how to work with the special ed teacher has been interesting.&nbsp; i actually like it because it's another set of hands, ears, and eyes in the classroom.&nbsp; i'm still trying to get used to our schedule but i feel really confident about this school year.&nbsp;they all seem to be a pretty good group of kids.&nbsp; hopefully things don't change.</p><p>grad school is expensive.&nbsp; especially if you're paying out of pocket which i am.&nbsp; or at least trying to.&nbsp; i'm pretty good with my money.&nbsp; i pay my bills on time, i don't live beyond my means, and i have money to pay for and buy things i need as well as want.&nbsp; but paying almost a grand per class for grad school is killing me!!&nbsp; i'm going to have to sit down and put myself on a serious budget so i don't have to put it on my credit card.&nbsp; i could always tap into my savings account, but i don't really wanna do that either.&nbsp; man, i'm relying on God for a miracle on this one.&nbsp; <br /><br />so once a month i do the announcements at church.&nbsp; i get up in front of the whole congregation and welcome the visitors, tell about the things that are going on in the church, and then pray for the service.&nbsp; needless to say it's a bit nerve-racking, especially since i have to do it three times because we have three services.&nbsp; on top of that i keep getting different things from different people.&nbsp; so when i listen to one person and do one thing and the other doesn't like it, i get told about it, and then vice versa.&nbsp; it's not a fun position to be in.&nbsp;but&nbsp; just keep reminding myself that i'm not doing announcements for man, but for God.&nbsp; honestly, that train of thought only works about half of the time.&nbsp; sometimes i feel i do a great job and other times i feel like i bombed.&nbsp; no matter how i feel i do someone always comes up to me to tell me what a good job i've done. i don't know if they're all telling the truth or what, but it does make me feel good.&nbsp; so if you see someone doing a good job at something, tell them.&nbsp; as trivial as it may seem&nbsp;for you to mention, do it anyway because more than likely it will make them feel good.&nbsp;<br /><br />i've been praying about a particular issue and i've seen God move.&nbsp; it's been pretty awesome.&nbsp; i have a feeling he's gonna do something pretty&nbsp;big and i can't wait to see what it is. <br /><br />my 25th birthday is in one month.&nbsp; i'm still in the process of planning it.&nbsp; i'm pretty excited, so i hope it'll be a success.&nbsp; <br /><br />olive garden has their never ending pasta bowl.&nbsp; i love olive garden even though it's fake italian.&nbsp; i especially love olive garden when they have their never ending pasta bowl.&nbsp; it's $8.95 for all the pasta you can eat.&nbsp; it's cheap and i love pasta!&nbsp;&nbsp; you can't beat that.&nbsp;they always have it around this time of year, and i always go.&nbsp;my line sister said she'd go with me, but she's not an easy&nbsp;person to catch up with.&nbsp;&nbsp;anybody wanna go with me? takers, hit me up.<br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","today we got our SOL scores from last year.&nbsp; mine look really good.&nbsp; in my teaching partner's class only one student failed the reading s.o.l.&nbsp; quite honestly i'm not surprised at all.&nbsp; we was on a 2nd grade reading level and got little to no support at home. on top of that he was a pain in the ass.&nbsp; in my class only one student failed the reading.&nbsp; his parents turned down free after school tutoring (which he really needed) because it interfered with his baseball schedule.&nbsp; lame.&nbsp; and in social studies not one student failed.&nbsp; that makes me happy.&nbsp; especially since i'm teaching social studies to the whole fourth grade.&nbsp; it gives me an extra boost of confidence.&nbsp; 

despite wonderful s.o.l scores, today was a hard day for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; it started last night and it just kinda continued.&nbsp; some bad decisions i made a little while ago&nbsp;came back to bite me in the ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;it sucks because for the past few months things have been going great for me.&nbsp; and it's&nbsp;for that reason i should have known that sooner or later something would come along&nbsp;to change that..&nbsp;i've tried to&nbsp;be optimistic and think positively, but my&nbsp;attempts haven't been too successful.&nbsp; in addition to that,&nbsp; i've experienced an overwhelming&nbsp;feeling of nostalgia.&nbsp; although i have an idea of where it came from, i just can't seem to shake it, and it's&nbsp;really bothering me.&nbsp; i'm trying my best&nbsp;to move on, but i feel&nbsp;rooted in one&nbsp;spot, and&nbsp;no matter what i do it&nbsp;doesn't make any difference, i'm stuck.&nbsp;it's a&nbsp;frustrating place&nbsp;to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; it's even more upsetting&nbsp;because just&nbsp;yesterday i was fine.&nbsp; i've been bombarded with all of these things in a 24 hour time period.&nbsp; i guess that's life, right?"

"event","<p>does anyone cook anymore?&nbsp; i ask this because i've been to a couple of people's houses, most of them with kids,&nbsp;and they all had pre-made things.&nbsp; they're refrigerators were full of things like chicken nuggets, hot dogs, and stuff of the like.&nbsp; why are your kids only eating box mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, and hot dogs? now don't get me wrong, those things are quick and easy, but where is the chicken, or beef, potatoes, green beans or things like that?&nbsp; it's no wonder kids today don't like vegetables or anything that's good for them.&nbsp; it's because their parents aren't feeding it to them.&nbsp; and&nbsp;you wonder why the kids are obese?&nbsp;my goodness.&nbsp; and on top of that, that means the adults are eating these type of things.&nbsp;&nbsp;i know that&nbsp;people are busy and don't have time to cook five course meals but&nbsp;processed chicken nuggets 3 times a&nbsp;week.&nbsp; my mom was a single mom in the navy and i had real meals all the time, so i know it's possible.&nbsp; maybe this is the norm and i don't know it, because i'm someone who likes to cook.&nbsp; i mean like, a meat, a starch and a vegetable with pretty much every meal.&nbsp;&nbsp;i plan to keep it that way when i get married and eventually have kids.<br /><br />speaking of having kids.&nbsp; i recently discovered i don't want them any time soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;a couple from my church went out of town for a week and asked me to pick up their children from the babysitter's and&nbsp;watch them for about 2 hours until the wife's sister came to the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;the kids&nbsp;are 3 and 1&nbsp;and 1/2.&nbsp; they were really good too.&nbsp; they were well behaved, sweet and cute, but they showed me i don't want kids soon.&nbsp; why you might wonder.&nbsp; because kids are too much damn responsibility.&nbsp; putting them in the car seat, hold one while i'm tryna get the other outta the car seat, watching them every single moment, trying to cook with them under my feet.&nbsp; phew!&nbsp; i still definitely want kids, that hasn't changed, but i don't want them anytime soon.&nbsp; geez.&nbsp; </p><p>i got an A in the class that i was taking. i was a complete slacker and waited til the last minute to do all of the work and i only got 2 hours of sleep, but i got all of it done.&nbsp; it's going to be interesting when i have to do both work and school.&nbsp; i don't even wanna think about it.&nbsp; </p><p>we had a meeting at work the other day.&nbsp; it was basically a waste of my time.&nbsp; but on top of it all we found out we can't work in our rooms just yet.&nbsp; that sucks because i like to go in early to get my life together, especially this year because things are going to be different.&nbsp; oh well. </p><p>God answers prayers, you can't tell me he doesn't.&nbsp; recently i had been praying for something that i thought was nearly impossible, but God showed me that nothing is impossible with him.&nbsp; you really only need the faith of a mustard seed.&nbsp; i'm excited to see what else he has in store.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I've said it&nbsp;millions of times,&nbsp;but the little things really mean a lot to me.&nbsp; i notice small things and they make me smile.&nbsp; it really isn't hard to make me happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

"event","&nbsp;life is a roller coaster.&nbsp; you have ups, you have downs, there are loops, at times you feel like you're turning upside down, sometimes life goes by so fast, others it's like you're going uphill oh so slowly.&nbsp; it's no wonder people, including me, are so emotional.&nbsp; how can you not be dealing with all of the things life throws at you.&nbsp; i know for a fact that it's that way for me.&nbsp; there really was no point in saying all that, just an observation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

i have thoroughly been enjoying my summer vacation.&nbsp; last week i was pretty much a bum the entire time.&nbsp; this week i'm taking a grad class.&nbsp; i'm quite pleased with it.&nbsp; it is actually something that will be useful.&nbsp; i've already learned a few things that i plan on using next year.&nbsp; in addition there isn't that much work involved.&nbsp; we have three presentations this week, and then the rest of the work is due in august.&nbsp; that includes reading two articles and doing a one-page write up, and then creating ten activities that involve technology.&nbsp; not hard.&nbsp; i plan on creating things that i can use next year.&nbsp; if i haven't mentioned before i'll be teaching just social studies next year.&nbsp; i am excited about it!&nbsp; social studies is my favorite subject to teach. i'll only have to plan for one subject.&nbsp; on top of that i won't have to do all of the crap that goes along with reading. woohoo! granted i will have to teach the same thing 4 times, but there are drawbacks to everything.&nbsp; oh well.&nbsp; on saturday i'm leaving for vegas.&nbsp; i'm excited.&nbsp; i've never been and it should be fun.&nbsp; after that i don't have anything planned for the rest of the summer.&nbsp; there are a couple of things i'd like to do around the apartment, but nothing serious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

today was a good day.&nbsp; i felt a sense of contentment and peace.&nbsp; it was as if nothing could bring me down.&nbsp; it was definitely a good feeling.&nbsp; i hope it continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

it's amazing the types of things people can teach you without even trying.&nbsp; i've learned things about life and myself from just the interaction with certain people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

i think when i decided to write this blog i had more substantial things to write.&nbsp;i don't know what happened."

"event","<p>&nbsp;it's been a looooong time since i've posted.&nbsp; believe it or not, i've actually been busy.&nbsp; over the past two months or so i've been busy with operation ""get my life together.""&nbsp; technically my life is together.&nbsp; i've got a degree, a car, i don't live at home, and i'm in the third year of my career, which i love.&nbsp; but there&nbsp;were a couple of things that i wanted to accomplish that i'd been putting off and i decided it was time to stop slacking.&nbsp; those things are as follows:<br />1. getting my masters degree.&nbsp;- so i've wanted my masters degree for about the past three years.&nbsp; there were a couple of reasons why i hadn't done anything to get it.&nbsp; the first being i wasn't exactly sure what i wanted to get a masters in.&nbsp; i knew that i didn't want to be in the classroom teaching 20some kids for the next 30 years, but i knew i still wanted to work with children and in the education field.&nbsp; at first i thought a master to become a reading specialist was the way to go, but after thinking about it i decided that wasn't the way to go because i don't really like teaching reading.&nbsp; after doing a bit of research, i decided on the field based masters program at ODU.&nbsp;&nbsp;after i decided what masters to get the next obstacle loomed before me...the GRE.&nbsp; now i'll be honest, the thought of taking that stupid test scared me. i heard it was a lot like the SAT and i didn't do so hot on the SAT so quite naturally there was some fear there, and plus it isn't a cheap test to take.&nbsp; well one day i woke and decided that i was being dumb and needed to take the stupid test, so i registered to do so.&nbsp; i did some of the practice questions online and did horribly.&nbsp; so i put my computer down, prayed to God asking him for a miracle (because there was NO other way i was going to do well) and went to bed.&nbsp; i woke up the next morning with peace, prayed one more time asking for a miracle, and&nbsp;went to take the test.&nbsp; God definitely came through and provided a miracle.&nbsp; i did better than i expected.&nbsp; so i start my first masters class on june 23rd.&nbsp; i'm excited about it although i know that will change as soon as i have work to do.&nbsp; oh well, thus is life.&nbsp; oh, and i almost forgot.&nbsp; after i get my masters i plan to get an endorsement to be a gifted and talented teacher.&nbsp; that's what i'll do when i get tired of having a classroom of students.&nbsp; that way i'm still in the education field but i won't have as many students.&nbsp; so that's my plan, we'll see how it goes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp; my weight/health - since i've graduated i've put on some weight.&nbsp; a first it crept up slowly and i was ok with it.&nbsp; but over the past few months i've put on more and at a more rapid weight and i'm not ok with that.&nbsp; by no means am i fat, but i'm not pleased with my the recent weight gain. a couple of weeks ago one of my co-workers told me that people like me make her sick because i'm skinny and i don't need to worry about losing weight.&nbsp; i replied by telling her that's how some people get fat.&nbsp; they gain 5 pounds and are ok with it, then it's 10 and they decide they can live with that, and then the next thing you know they've put on more weight than they want and at that point it's hard to get off. well i decided i was gonna get things under control before it's too late.&nbsp; so&nbsp;i've been going to the gym 3 times a week and i'm seeing a difference and that makes me feel good.&nbsp; in addition i actually found out that i don't hate exercising as much as i thought i did.&nbsp; i don't absolutely love it, but it's not horrible.&nbsp; plus, high blood pressure runs in my family so i'm trying to stay as healthy as possible in hopes that i can avoid it&nbsp; or at least put it off for as long as possible.<br />3.&nbsp; my finances - my mom has told me over and over that the time to get your money right is when your young and i'm listening and taking action.&nbsp; about two weeks ago i paid my last car payment (early i might add)!&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm happy about that.&nbsp; so now i'm going to take that money to pay off my credit card, which i hope to have paid off by the end of the year.&nbsp; after that the only debt i will have (besides the necessary ones like rent, insurance, electricity, water, etc.) will be my student loan.&nbsp;&nbsp;and my goal with that&nbsp;is to pay that off as soon as possible.&nbsp; not only will these things improve my credit, but they'll help me be a better steward of my money.&nbsp;&nbsp;in addition, in the next&nbsp;few years i want to buy a house and it helps to have good credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />4.&nbsp; me - that one is pretty self explanatory.&nbsp;&nbsp; as i grow older i seem to become more of the person i want to be. i think the 20's are an age of self-discovery.&nbsp; i've learned and continue to learn all sorts of things.&nbsp; things i want out of life, things i just won't tolerate, the type of people i need to rid myself of, the tye of people who are a positive influence in my life, and generally what i want out of life and my goals and expectations are becoming more and more clear.&nbsp;improving as a person is&nbsp;a continuous process and i'm taking it one day at a time.&nbsp;

"event","&nbsp;today completely sucked ass.&nbsp; there's no other way to put it.&nbsp; possibly the worst year of 2008 thus far.&nbsp; allow me to explain why.&nbsp; i woke up this morning and just couldn't seem to get myself going.&nbsp; have you ever waken up and just knew that it was going to be a long day? well if so, that's how i felt.&nbsp; so i went through my normal morning routine; check the weather, read my bible, shower, get dressed, walk out the door.&nbsp; it's wednesday so of course we had a faculty meeting, joy.&nbsp; i make it through all of the stupidity of our usual faculty meetings.&nbsp; then i go to my room to get ready for the day (with the ten minutes i have before my students get there)&nbsp;and it's then that i remember that my computer went screwy the day before and swallowed my entire gradebook.&nbsp; but wait, i have hope, the computer resource teacher is on the case and is going to work on recovering it.&nbsp; she's worked her magic before and found a file that we thought had been deleted, so she'll surely come through! right?! WRONG! she and two other people did everything they possibly knew how to do, but no gradebook.&nbsp; so i am completely gradebook bookless.&nbsp; that's pretty much one of the worst thigns that can happen to a teacher.&nbsp; every grade i've ever put in for my kids for the 2007 - 2008 school year is gone, completely gone.&nbsp; i have conferences on monday....what am i supposed to say?&nbsp; ""well Mr. and Mrs. So and So your child is failing but i don't have any grades, you're just going to have to take my word for it""&nbsp; yeah, i'm sure that'll go over well.&nbsp; on top of that i have to send progress reports home on thursday.&nbsp; how exactly i'm going to do that with no grades, i have absolutely no clue.&nbsp; oh and wait, did i forget that for report cards at the end of the year i'm supposed to average the grades from all four nine weeks.&nbsp; hmm, that should work really well with no gradebook!&nbsp; so if that weren't bad enough, i have to go in tomorrow and tell my principal and assistant principal (who by the way has been riding my ass all year) that i have no grade book.&nbsp; that's going to be the highlight of my day, i just know it is.&nbsp; of course all of this is playing through my mind all day which is why my kids irritated me to no end today. i'm not sure if they were even more obnoxious than usual or if i was just upset and every little thing they did got on my nerves.&nbsp; my teaching partner said today sucked so i'm guessing it wasn't just me.&nbsp; i'm driving home replaying the events of the day and i start to get really upset.&nbsp; so i called my line sister and told her all about it, and as hard as i tried not to, i cried my eyes out.&nbsp; i was so upset, i didn't know any other way to deal with it.&nbsp; she did her best at trying to console me, but it's pretty safe to say i was pretty unconsolable.&nbsp; i didn't really need to be consoled, i just needed someone to be there and listen to me while i was upset.&nbsp; she did a good job.&nbsp; i came home and went to sleep for like an hour.&nbsp; then i woke up, ate dinner and went to small group.&nbsp; small group helped me take my mind off of all of it for awhile. plus i really like going to small group, it's always encouraging.&nbsp; but sitting back and thinking about it all, it just really sucks.&nbsp; i was just starting to feel like just about everything in my life was pretty stable.&nbsp; i had done some things i'd been putting off, attempted to solve some problems, dealt with some issues, was doing ok at work, etc.&nbsp; i mean things weren't&nbsp;excellent but i feel like i was making progress and moving forward only to be knocked back&nbsp;flat on&nbsp;my ass.&nbsp; not a good feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i know it sounds cliche, but i know God has a plan and perhaps this someone how fits into it. i don't know.&nbsp; if i'm being completely honest, i don't see how anything good could possibly come out of such a seemingly shitty situation.&nbsp; but then again, i'm only human.&nbsp; i guess that's why it says in the Bible that we live by faith and not by sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;hopefully i can&nbsp;stop using my sight and rely more on&nbsp;faith.&nbsp; &nbsp;i'm going to bed hoping i'll wake up and realize it was all a bad dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","<p>not too long ago i was observed by my assistant principal.&nbsp; and shortly after i had my post observation conference.&nbsp; my post observation conference was actually with my principal and assistant principal.&nbsp; i won't bore you with all the details.&nbsp; 90% of the things my assistant principal had to say were negative.&nbsp; as i've said before, she's a nit-picker and she definitely was at her peak that day.&nbsp; almost everything negative that she had to say was about my lesson plans.&nbsp; you may be thinking, 'ok, big deal'.&nbsp; well let me explain why that made me so mad.&nbsp; in mid-december my a.p. came around to check lesson plans, and i didn't have them.&nbsp; yeah, completely my fault, but whatever.&nbsp; so because i didn't have them she told me i had to turn my lesson plans in every monday so that she could make sure that i had them.&nbsp; a bit embarrassing and upsetting, but hey it was my fault so&nbsp;i have to accept the consequences.&nbsp; well i've been handing in my plans for&nbsp; the past 5 weeks or so and she said NOTHING about them, nothing!&nbsp; so it pissed me off that she waited until my post-observation conference to say something and as a result i got an&nbsp;""N"" (Needs Improvement) on my yearly evaluation that goes downtown.&nbsp; great.&nbsp; so when i saw the ""N"" and heard what she said, i spoke up.&nbsp; i told her that i didn't understand how i got that when she's been getting my plans for the past 5 weeks and hasn't said anything to me.&nbsp; i told her that i didn't know anything was wrong with them because she hadn't told me.&nbsp; all she could do was sit there and give me a blank stare, because i was right!&nbsp; after a few seconds of silence the principal spoke up and asked if i needed more immediate feedback.&nbsp; um, yeah!&nbsp; i think 5 weeks is more than sufficient time to give me some type of feedback, but hey whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;after i was berated for almost an hour (during which my eyes got a little watery) my a.p. said she hopes i didn't think that they were ganging up on me and beating me down.&nbsp; um, no, i LOVE to be made painfully aware of every single flaw you think i have, it really makes my day.&nbsp; anyway, i took what they said, and the workshop i went to a couple of weekends ago and i've used it as motivation.&nbsp; all of it has just renewed my passion for my job.&nbsp; i'll admit, i had kind of gotten complacent, and just merely doing my job was enough for me.&nbsp; over the past few weeks i've been waking up earlier so that i can go into work to get things done, because that seems to work better than staying late.&nbsp; although my teaching partner and i have decided that we'll stay late on thursdays so that's what we've been doing.&nbsp; although despite the going in a little early i still have about a million papers to grade.&nbsp; report cards go out next week, and they're due in the office by tuesday at 3:30. joy.&nbsp; monday we have some dumb family fitness night that took the place of PTA that we have to go to. bleck.&nbsp; so that means i'm going to have to grade my life away this weekend (probably sunday) so i can put the grades in the grade book on monday and fill out the stupid report cards on tuesday.&nbsp; fun.&nbsp; at least tuesday is early release.&nbsp; oh, and i almost forgot, after my post observation conference was over, my principal showed me the letter that was being sent downtown to say i got tenure!&nbsp; yay!&nbsp;<br /><br />a few weeks ago at church the pastor said something during his sermon that has had me thinking.&nbsp; he said ""God calls us to love people right where they are, not where you think they should be."" .&nbsp; i was able to relate to that because it seems that people are always trying to tell me what i should be doing, or that they can't believe i haven't done this or that.&nbsp; they don't come right out and say it, but somehow because i'm not where they think i should be, or i haven't done things they think i should,&nbsp; that something is wrong with me.&nbsp; not only that but that i'm hopeless or a lost cause, or that i might as well be passed by or whatever.&nbsp; i think sometimes they fail to realize that i am who i am because that's the way God wanted&nbsp;me to be, and that doesn't make me any better or any less than anyone else, it just makes me me.&nbsp; so after thinking about it for awhile God showed me that it went the other way.&nbsp; that i had the same way of thinking about other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;i thought about it some&nbsp;more and realized that there are some&nbsp;people in my life who i feel&nbsp;aren't where i think they should be, or who aren't doing what i think they should be doing.&nbsp; i have to remember they're who they are and where they are because that's the way God has planned it.&nbsp;and because of &nbsp;that it doesn't make them a lost cause, or hopeless any more than it makes me the same. the pastor went on to say that God is doing a work in the people&nbsp;we know and he isn't gonna change the work he's doing in his/her life just to suit&nbsp;you.&nbsp; so i've made more a of&nbsp;conscience effort ot love the people in my life right where they are, and not where i think they should be.&nbsp; it's definitely easier&nbsp;said than done, but then again, most things are.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />life is good these days.&nbsp; ive experienced an incredible amount of peace and joy in the past few weeks.&nbsp; a couple of times nostalgia has crept in and&nbsp;caused&nbsp;feelings of wistfulness, but i was able to shake it off pretty quickly.&nbsp; as mary j. blige would say, my life's just fine. </p>"

"event","now i see why there aren't black people in the NHL.&nbsp; that's because ice skating isn't easy.&nbsp; i'm a decent skater so i thought perhaps ice skating would be similar.&nbsp; while it is, there's the whole this is ice and it's slippery, hard and cold and i don't wanna fall on it factor.&nbsp; and it didn't help that not even five minutes after we got there a man fell and had to be taken away on a gurney.&nbsp; that wasn't encouraging....at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; for awhile i was skating and holding on to the rail, i wasn't tryna lose my life.&nbsp; but after awhile i got the hang of it and was able to skate without holding onto the rail. i skated right next to it thought, just in case. overall i had fun. (even though my back really hurts as a result) 

today my assistant principal came to observe me.&nbsp; normally i'm not too nervous or worried about being observed, but this time i was.&nbsp; it's because my assistant principal is a know nit-picker.&nbsp; i could do 98 out of 100 things right and she spend 10 seconds on what i did right and 10 minutes on the things i've done wrong.&nbsp; then on top of that she doesn't tell me how to improve it. blah.&nbsp; anyway, because i knew she was coming i was able to dread it.&nbsp; my teaching partner and i were talking about how knowing our observations were coming up (mine today, his tomorrow) that it put a damper on our weekend.&nbsp; we both agreed that it was hard to forget about it and enjoy the weekend.&nbsp; and even more so since it since she's been extra nit-picky in the past few months.&nbsp; it was apparently bothering me more than i thought because i didn't sleep very well last night, and this morning i was having a hard time focusing.&nbsp; every so often my mind would drift back to my observation, worrying if i'd have enough time to clean my room? what is she gonna say about my gradebook? my lesson plans? etc.&nbsp; it was weird, i was nervous all the way up until the moment she walked into my classroom (late, i might add....she's such a hypocrite).&nbsp; after that it was like, i'm doing what i love to do, i don't care what you think.&nbsp; my lesson went really well, my kids were well behaved, and i feel pretty confident about it all.&nbsp; we shall see after i have my post observation conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;

there was one more thing i wanted to talk about, but i'm tired from not getting much sleep last night and my back is really killing me.&nbsp; so i'ma take some motrin and go to bed.&nbsp; maybe i'll get around to posting again tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","<p>so yesterday i was sitting around thinking about the events of the day, and i came up with the following.&nbsp; they're things i learned and/or re-discovered, or just random thoughts&nbsp;from the past couple of days.<br />1.&nbsp; waking up at 6am wasn't as hard as i thought it'd be.&nbsp; i woke up at 6 wednesday, and thursday and went into work early to get stuff done.&nbsp; i plan to do the same thing tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp; i enjoy my job....i love my kids.&nbsp; most days that is.&nbsp; having the break was nice.&nbsp; when my students came back i saw them as 9 and 10 year old kid instead of these little people called my students.&nbsp; most of them are sweet kids and are a joy to be around.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />3.&nbsp; sometimes i can be a bitch.&nbsp; i admit that and i'm thankful for the people who love me anyway.&nbsp; everyone has personality flaws, that happens to be one of mine.&nbsp; sometimes it seems i can't help it, other times it's very deliberate and purposeful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />4.&nbsp; life is full of unexpected ups and downs.&nbsp; and if you attempt to have a positive attitude it makes the downs a little easier to bear.&nbsp;<br />5.&nbsp; my mom really is one of my best friends.&nbsp; i love that i can talk to her about almost anything.&nbsp; sometimes it surprises me how much she understands me.&nbsp; but then again it has just been me and her for the past 24 years so you kinda get to know a person. haha.&nbsp;<br /><br />today i have a couple of things to add.&nbsp;<br />1.&nbsp; being productive is a very rewarding feeling.&nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp; i know very little about politics.&nbsp; i think it's something i'd like to learn more about. like what exactly is a caucus?&nbsp; and why is iowa so important in this caucus business?&nbsp; when i don't know something it makes me want to find out.&nbsp; i love learning new things.<br />3.&nbsp; personal growth is a wonderful thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />4.&nbsp; sometimes i'm too passive.&nbsp; i don't wanna be a push-over, but sometimes i fear i am.&nbsp; hmm, perhaps that's something i should work on.<br />5.&nbsp; i have some decisions to make.&nbsp; i've been putting lots of thought and don't know that i'm any closer to making up my mind. i don't know if that's because of my indecisiveness or because they're just hard decisions.&nbsp; i'm pretty sure it's a combination of both.&nbsp;<br /><br />hope you've enjoyed my randomness. you can leave comments and let me know whether you do or not.&nbsp; it'd be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>"

"event","ok, so i know i just posted an entry not even 24 hours ago but i obviously have something more to say.&nbsp; i'm gonna be using second person, but in most cases i'll be talking about me.&nbsp; so lately God has me in a season of waiting.&nbsp; i've gone to him with questions and request and at first i wasn't sure he was hearing me, then i thought he was telling me no, but it wasn't until i started to draw closer to God that i realized he has been telling me to&nbsp;wait.&nbsp; ok, God, i'll wait, but i'm not happy about it was my initial response.&nbsp; so my impatient&nbsp; waiting went on for awhile.&nbsp; so after waiting, a sufficient amount of time in my opinion,&nbsp;&nbsp;i went to God like 'ok God, i've been waiting, i don't see you moving or working on these questions and requests.&nbsp; well it was then that God got more specifically, he said&nbsp; 'wait patiently.'&nbsp; see i learned that there is a BIG difference in waiting, and waiting patiently.&nbsp; the difference is in waiting patiently you not only&nbsp;accept the season you're in but you look to see what you can learn from it.&nbsp; that was confirmed the other day when i was talking to my mom and in church today (in both of the services i went to).&nbsp;my mom was reading something to me out of a book she read and it was saying that you either look at Jesus as your handyman or as your lover.&nbsp; a handyman is the one who comes in to fix things when they're broken, and then leaves once everything is working properly.&nbsp; while the lover is there through the thick and thin and loves you and is there when things are good and when things are bad.&nbsp; so in&nbsp;your life is Jesus your handyman or lover? &nbsp;in the first sermon that pastor said this (i'm paraphrasing slightly) ""God isn't there to deliver us from tough times, but to develop us in those tough times.""&nbsp;&nbsp; in the second one the person teaching said ""God is more interested in growing you than providing you with the answers""&nbsp;when you look at it that way, it makes sense why God still has me in this season of waiting.&nbsp; because i was just asking God to bring me out of it&nbsp;instead of developing me while i was in it. well now my outlook has changed.&nbsp; i'm in this season of waiting for a reason, and in accepting that and seeking God to see what he wants me to learn, the past couple of weeks have been a bit easier to deal with.&nbsp; i'm not saying that it's been a piece of cake, because if you want me to be honest lots of tears have been shed, but i'm learning.&nbsp; i continue to ask God to give me a spirit of peace and he's been faithful and has done&nbsp;so.&nbsp; and quite frankly i'm quite excited that God is working in me to change me into the woman of Christ he wants me to be.&nbsp; after typing this i see that i've revealed quite&nbsp;a few things about me and what's going on in my life,&nbsp;but i'm gonna post it any way because in sharing my testimony with you (the few who read this)&nbsp;i hope that perhaps you're able to take something away from it.&nbsp;"

"event","i've thoroughly been enjoying my break.&nbsp; it feels so good to not have to set my alarm clock.&nbsp; waking up whenever i feel like it has been fabulous.&nbsp; because my body is so used to waking up at 6:30 i can't seem to sleep past about 9 or so, but even those extra hours have been wonderful.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

it's rare that i call people because i have something going on and i need to talk.&nbsp; but it seems that when i do, nobody i call is ever able to talk.&nbsp; perhaps that's why i don't bother most times.&nbsp; i know it's not their fault, but it can still be discouraging.&nbsp; ah, oh well, that's life i suppose.

lately i've been watching football.&nbsp; in a previous post i said i wanted to learn more about football and actually enjoy watching the game, and that i have.&nbsp; more so the enjoy watching the game than the learning more about it.&nbsp; i don't know much more than i did before, but i'm able to enjoy it with what knowledge i do have.&nbsp; i noticed if you listen to the guys talking they'll explain some things, but i still have some questions.&nbsp;like what is a blitz? if you ask me, it&nbsp;sounds like something i can order at IHOP.&nbsp; and what exactly does a half back, full back, safety, tight end (although if you ask me they all have nice&nbsp;tight ends in those tight little football pants ;) , etc. do?&nbsp;and if there's a wide receiver why is there no narrow receiver?&nbsp;i tried&nbsp;looking it up on the internet (like i do&nbsp;almost everything when i don't understand something) and it got me nowhere.&nbsp; i didn't really understand what the heck they were&nbsp;saying.&nbsp;my efforts to watch football with someone who understands and can explain haven't been too successful lately, so&nbsp;i tried watching with my mom,&nbsp;who likes and claims she understands football.&nbsp; that may be true, but she is a HORRIBLE explainer, oh my gosh.&nbsp; 

with the ending of one year and the starting of a new one it makes me reflect on the past year.&nbsp; i've looked back on the positives and negatives to see what went well and what didn't.&nbsp; i look at the ways in which i've changed and grown.&nbsp; i take a look at what things i can keep the same and what things i need to change.&nbsp; and at the end of this year i need to re-evaluate my friendships.&nbsp; i find that i've&nbsp;put a lot of&nbsp;time and effort into some friendships only for them to be one-sided.&nbsp; i hate to feel like i'm giving up on people, but sometimes it just has to be that way, especially with those friendships in which i feel that i'm the only one contributing to the survival of the friendship.&nbsp; a relationship of any kind requires both people to put in work, and it's just not fair to me if i'm the only who's really putting forth the effort, and that's how it feels.&nbsp; i'm not ending the friendships completely, although that's probably what i should do.&nbsp; i'm just not putting as much time and effort into friendships&nbsp;i feel are one-sided.&nbsp; it sounds like a no brainer and like it'll be something that's easy.&nbsp; i tend to put my all into my friendships and&nbsp;i take it pretty personally when they seem to be faling, even if it's not my fault.&nbsp; so to not put my all into something, more specifically someone is going to be&nbsp;difficult for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;people make time for the things and people who are important to them, so if i'm not important enough for them to make time, or put forth effort then i'm not gonna go outta my way for them.&nbsp; on the other hand there have been positive things that have come out of this year. one&nbsp;of those&nbsp;is my ability to recover.&nbsp; i'm an emotional and sensitive person, i can't help it, that's&nbsp;just the way i am.&nbsp; but this year, i have learned to recover and bounce back from&nbsp;things more quickly.&nbsp; the ability to do that&nbsp;has definitely&nbsp;had a positive impact in my life.&nbsp; i'm not&nbsp;big on resolutions,&nbsp;they just end&nbsp;up being broken anyway.&nbsp; last year i only made one resolution and that was to pray more, and i accomplished that.&nbsp;&nbsp;so this year, i'm making a similar resolution so to speak.&nbsp; in the last half of&nbsp;2007 my relationship with God has grown stonger, and my ""resolution"" for 2008 is to seek God in all that I do and to continue to grow in Christ.&nbsp; And it just occured to me that&nbsp;because of this 'resolution' i'm going to place my failing friendships in his&nbsp;hands, and i pray that he'll do what he sees fit with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;i'd really love to seem them improved, i really would.&nbsp; i really feel that God has&nbsp;been working in me and that he has good things waiting for me in&nbsp;2008 and i can't wait&nbsp;until he shows me what they are.&nbsp; so,&nbsp;as&nbsp;2007&nbsp;ends and 2008 begins, i&nbsp;pray that you and yours are blessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

i hate the cold weather.&nbsp; one reason being i just hate being cold.&nbsp; another is, i find that my back hurts more often and more painfully in the winter. blah.&nbsp; on top of that my nails tend to break more in the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;it's also so much harder to get outta bed in the&nbsp;winter time.&nbsp; one thing i do like about winter is&nbsp;curling up&nbsp;on the couch with a blanket&nbsp;and reading or watching&nbsp;t.v.&nbsp;&nbsp;i'll have to make sure i do that over the break. 

on friday my roommate is going home for&nbsp;like a week.&nbsp; i enjoy having a roommate, but it's also nice&nbsp;having the apartment to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;every time she goes home i always joke that i'm gonna have a wild party and have lots of strippers.&nbsp; we both get a kick outta that because she and i both know that is definitely not something i'd do.&nbsp; i'll probably end up just hanging&nbsp;around looking for something to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

lately i've been doing a lot&nbsp;of thinking.&nbsp; in doing all of this thinking&nbsp;i've come to&nbsp;some conclusions.&nbsp; that in itself is a whole separate blog that i'll probably write at a later date, not making any promises though.&nbsp;

"event","<p>i've stated before that at night i tend to have trouble breathing and therefore falling asleep. well on thursday it got unbearable.&nbsp; but before i talk about that let me rewind to wednesday.&nbsp; wednesday i woke up feeling kinda crappy, but i went to work anyway. no big deal.&nbsp; well as each minute passed it seems i felt worse and worse until i felt like crap, and apparently i looked like it because the secretaries and my assistant principal said i needed to go home.&nbsp; so i did.&nbsp; i stopped by the store got some medicine and orange juice and slept for like 4 hours.&nbsp; but anyway, back to thursday.&nbsp; so thursday i felt slightly better&nbsp;so i went to work.&nbsp;well when i say slightly better i meant, i didn't feel like crap any more, but i was having trouble breathing.&nbsp;&nbsp;as the day passed, it got progressively harder to breath.&nbsp; so much so that&nbsp;people could hear my wheezing while i was trying to breathe.&nbsp; so it was then that i decided i needed to go to the doctor.&nbsp; after work i went to the doctor and surprisingly i didn't have to&nbsp;wait forever to be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;it's bad when the nurse who takes your vitals tells you you sound like crap.&nbsp; they decided to give me a nebulizer to try and help me breathe.&nbsp;&nbsp;it didn't&nbsp;work.&nbsp; i was still having&nbsp;trouble breathing.&nbsp; she said there was nothing else she could do for me there, that i'd have to make an appointment with my primary care physician&nbsp;so&nbsp;they could order a pulmonary somethingoranother test to see what the problem was.&nbsp;&nbsp;but in the meantime she would prescribe me some steroids and an inhaler.&nbsp;&nbsp;the 6 days steroids&nbsp;are to stop the inflammation of my lungs which is what was making it difficult for me to breathe, and the inhaler was&nbsp;obviously to use when i needed it.&nbsp; &nbsp;i took the steroids and inhaler as soon as i got them on thursday and it did a little good.&nbsp; by mid afternoon the combination of the steroids and the inhaler made it easier for me to breathe.&nbsp; the steroids must be working because i haven't had to use the inhaler since noon on friday.&nbsp; i have a cough that sounds absolutely awful, but at least i can breathe.&nbsp; so i'm hoping that the steroids will do the trick and i won't have to go back to get that test done.&nbsp; we'll see, i guess.&nbsp;<br /><br />last week i hung out with a friend&nbsp;&nbsp;and while i was there he was watching football.&nbsp; now those of you who know me know that football isn't exactly my favorite sport, and that's because i don't completely understand it.&nbsp; i have an idea of what's going on and some general knowledge about what the players are doing, but nothing substantial.&nbsp; so anyway, he's watching a football game and honestly for like the first 20 minutes i was looking at the screen but i haven't the slightest idea what was going on.&nbsp; why? because i wasn't really watching the game, i was thinking about 10 million other things....what i don't know, but anything to keep from having to endure the football game on t.v.&nbsp; well&nbsp;after awhile i got tired of doing that so i decided to actually watch the game.&nbsp;as&nbsp;we were&nbsp;watching the game&nbsp;i realized there were things i didn't understand.&nbsp; so what did i do? i asked questions....lots of questions, and he answered&nbsp; each and every one...quite patiently i might add. (kudos to him!)&nbsp;&nbsp;a couple of days later i went to work and&nbsp;told my&nbsp;teaching partner about the&nbsp;football knowledge i had gained.&nbsp; he was proud of the tidbits i had learned and gave me a few more to add to my repertoire football knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;between my friend and my teaching partner, i enjoyed learning about football.&nbsp;&nbsp;i've also liked learning things and so this is no&nbsp;different.&nbsp; so i've decided that i'm going to watch&nbsp;more football so that i can&nbsp;gain a&nbsp;better understanding of the game.&nbsp; my ultimate goal is to actually know what's happening&nbsp; in the game when&nbsp;the superbowl comes around.&nbsp; (unlike last year in which i simply watched the superbowl because i felt it was my american duty and because of the commercials.&nbsp; haha, sad but true)&nbsp; but the only problem with watching more football is me having more questions.&nbsp; with that being said....who's up for watching football with me and&nbsp;suffering through&nbsp;the tons of questions i'll&nbsp;undoubtedly have?&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; any takers?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>i can't wait until thanksgiving break!&nbsp; thanksgiving is my favorite holiday.&nbsp; my mom was talking about going to south carolina to visit my grandma for thanksgiving.&nbsp; but the other day she was reconsidering that because gas is ridiculously expensive.&nbsp; so she's not entirely sure.&nbsp; i think she's leaning toward us just staying here and having thanksgiving at the house.&nbsp;although i haven't seen my grandma in a little while,&nbsp;i'd probably prefer to stay&nbsp;here.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>today while running errands with my mom i was reminded that soon i'm going to have to get my christmas shopping done.&nbsp;i was thinking about the people i'm buying gifts for and i couldn't come up with anything.&nbsp; i like to give meaningful and personal gifts, gifts that fit the person's personality.&nbsp; usually i have some general kind of idea of what i'm going to get, but this year i'm drawing a complete blank on everyone.&nbsp; i'm going to need to get that together....hopefully it'll come to me.&nbsp; but if you're someone who knows you're going to get a christmas gift from me, you should drop me a hint of what you'd like.&nbsp; i know that's like cheating, but i need a little help this year. haha.&nbsp;<br /><br />i doubt i'll&nbsp;post again before thrusday, so i hope everyone has a wonderful and safe thanksgiving holiday.&nbsp; &nbsp;"

"event","not too much as been going on.&nbsp; just a bunch of randomness really.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

last sunday i was flossing my teeth and saw that it looked like one of my fillings was coming out. so i made a dentist appointment on monday and surely enough it was coming out.&nbsp; actually my dentist said i broke the filling.&nbsp; how you break a metal filling, i haven't the slightest idea, but apparently i did.&nbsp; so anyway he replaced it (with a white filling, so now you can't even see where it is) and i'm good to go.&nbsp; although from the middle of my mouth up to my right ear was number for like 4 hours. good times.&nbsp; now i'm extra paranoid because the filling was in one of the two baby teeth i have (no adult teeth ever grew in) so i wanna make sure that it doesn't fall out anytime soon, and i had&nbsp;been chewing on only the left side of my mouth.&nbsp; let me tell you, that gets tiring.&nbsp; i've finally started chewing on the right side again, but i'm extra cautious. 

&nbsp;as you may or may not know , the week before last my principal came to do my yearly observation (i only have to get observed once a year from here on out. yay!)&nbsp; i thought it went pretty well.&nbsp; i wasn't nervous or anything before she came.&nbsp; i'm not sure if that's because i was that confident or because i dislike my principal so&nbsp;much, i wasn't really concerned. haha. either way, she came observed me, and left a bit early because there was an emergency in the school that she had to take care of.&nbsp; i thought it went pretty well.&nbsp; but the point of the story is this.&nbsp; on friday at the end of the day she says that she needs to see 7 teachers, me included (even though half the names she called weren't the right people...that just shows you how much of an idiot she is.) so i pack my things and go to the office to find out that she wants to have our post-observation conference....on a friday afternoon!!!!&nbsp; i was quite perturbed.&nbsp; there were 4 people ahead of me and each conference seemed to take forever.&nbsp; so needless to say i didn't leave work on friday afternoon until like 5:45.&nbsp; i was soo mad!&nbsp; it's not my fault that the post-observation conferences were due downtown that day.&nbsp; once again, my principal is an idiot.&nbsp; but at any rate she had nothing but positive things to say.&nbsp; She didn't have anything negative to say about my lesson plans, which is a first because administration ALWAYS has something to say about my lesson plans.&nbsp; then again i did start putting effort into writing better plans this year....hmm, perhaps that made the difference. haha.&nbsp; i felt pretty good afterward...except the fact that i left work at 5:45 on a friday evening!&nbsp; grrr&nbsp; i am really excited that this tuesday is a teacher workday so we won't have any kids, and next monday is veteran's day so i don't even have to go to work.&nbsp; then the week after that is thanksgiving break.&nbsp; woohoo, for november being a month with lots of day off!&nbsp; then all i have to do is make it through i few weeks in december and we're off for christmas break.&nbsp; when i look at it that way it's totally manageable.&nbsp; the only then between now and then that'll slow me down is report cards.&nbsp; i HATE doing report card crap.&nbsp; blah.&nbsp; but whatever, it'll be ok, especially since each year gets a bit easier.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

bills suck.&nbsp; 

i figured out why i had been having a hard time sleeping the past few weeks.&nbsp; it was because i was having trouble breathing so i wasn't sleeping well, and on top of that i had this cough that wouldn't go away.&nbsp; i noticed it one night when i was falling asleep and had to wake up because i wasn't getting enough air.&nbsp; so for a good two weeks i wasn't getting good sleep because at about 8 or 9 my chest would start to get really tight and i couldn't breathe very well.&nbsp; this past week hasn't been too bad and i've been able to fall asleep (most nights) and i've definitely been able to tell the difference.&nbsp; so let's hope it stays that way.&nbsp; otherwise i'm gonna have to make a doctor's appointment to see what's going on.&nbsp; man, i have never been so sickly and&nbsp;such as i have in these past few months.&nbsp; i usually have a pretty good immune system.&nbsp; what on earth is going on?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

i can be a bit of a perfecitonist at times.&nbsp; it's not all the time and it's not with everything.&nbsp; the other day i&nbsp;was writing something, and i know that i read it and revised it about 20 times before&nbsp;i was satisfied.&nbsp; i was going to write it by hand but then i knew that i'd want to change it numerous times so it was just more practical to type it.&nbsp; i find that it's usually when i'm writing something or making something for somebody&nbsp;that everything has to be just so before i'm satisfied with it.&nbsp; i'm not sure why that is, but whatever.&nbsp; i'm fine with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

other than a couple of personal things, not much else is going on....not like that comes as a big surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp; i shall return later with more randomness.&nbsp; until then, leave comments!"

"event","so i've been doing a lot of thinking today.&nbsp; not necessarily on purpose, it just kinda happened.&nbsp; there are two things that i've been thinking about.&nbsp; one of them popped into my head while driving to work, and the other came from the guest speaker we had at convocation today. i'm gonna attempt to put in writing what was going on in my head...i'm not sure how well that's gonna work, but here goes....i hope it makes sense....

just to give you a little background, let me tell you what the speaker was talking about.&nbsp; he was saying how he and his wife had a daughter and she passed away of cancer at age 3.&nbsp; the students at his school started a tree of life in which they donated money.&nbsp; he said it wasn't the fact that they were giving money that touched him but that they were trying to do something in the first place.&nbsp; well he was saying he went back to work on the last day and there had been this boy who had given him trouble all year.&nbsp; this boy caused trouble when he expected and he presented him with surprises and caused trouble when he least expected it.&nbsp; well anyway he was saying that on the last day of school, this boy who had caused various amounts of trouble all year was walking out of the door (leaving middle school for high school) and turned around and told the speaker that he didn't have much but he wanted to give the only dime he had to the tree of life to support his daughter.&nbsp; the speaker was saying how much that touched him because the boy could have just walked away and that would have been it.&nbsp; but he was touched because when the trouble maker boy did that he should him who he was, and at that point it didn't matter how he had behaved.&nbsp; the speaker was saying that we as teachers have to care about students for who they are and not how they behave.&nbsp; when i thought about it i realized how true that is.&nbsp; but then i realized that that could be applied to more than just students.&nbsp; in life we care about people for who they are and not how they behave....well most of the time.&nbsp; i&nbsp;mean think about, if your friend has a bad day, or someone you care about is a complete asshole&nbsp;to you, you don't just say f***k them because they're behaving badly.&nbsp; you care about them for who they are, cuss them out, ignore them for awhile or whatever, but that doesn't necessarily change how you feel about them.&nbsp; well it shouldn't, not if you truly care about them for who they are.&nbsp; this becomes apparent when people are looking in on a situation that one of their friends are in.&nbsp; take for instance, one of my friends had someone close to them treat them pretty crappy.&nbsp; he was not a very good friend to her, and some of us were telling her to ditch him and stop being friends with him&nbsp;or whatever because he wasn't behaving in a manner in which we felt he should.&nbsp;&nbsp;she saw that he was behaving like the biggest&nbsp;ass on the face of the planet, but she still stayed friends with him because of who he was, not how he happened to be&nbsp;behaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;so i stopped to think about it, and realized that that's the case in my life.&nbsp; a couple of people i know can really suck at life sometimes and be complete jerks, BUT i care deeply about them and&nbsp;i focus more on who they are, and less on how they behave.&nbsp; now as i type this i know some of you are thinking that that means these people are getting&nbsp;away with&nbsp;behaving badly and we're just letting them get away with&nbsp;it.&nbsp; that's not that case, you can still be upset about how they're behaving, or disagree completely with the way they're acting, but&nbsp;genuinely caring about someone means loving them in spite of their imperfections. i think about it like this.&nbsp; God can't stand the way we behave when we sin and do things against him, BUT he still loves and cares about us.&nbsp; sometimes he punishes us, and let's us know he's not happy with the way we behave, but he doesn't EVER love or care about us any less.&nbsp; it's practically the same thing with the people in our lives. 

the other thing is actually kinda like two things in one.&nbsp; the other week at church and at my small group the topic of being transparent with people came up.&nbsp; and so i started thinking about the concept and all it entails.&nbsp; i came to the conclusion that there are 2 sometimes 3 people that i'm pretty transparent with.&nbsp; i'm me with no apologies, they see the good, the bad, the happy, the sad, the emotional, the irrational, the insane, the who or whatever it is at the moment.&nbsp; i'm 100% me all of the time.&nbsp; and it's not that i'm not me around everyone i know, it's just that everyone doesn't get to see the depths of all that i am....if that makes sense.&nbsp; but anyway, it obviously wasn't always like that.&nbsp; so i got to thinking about how something like that happens.&nbsp; because being transparent with someone means presenting your vulnerability and most people don't like that.&nbsp; i came to the conclusion that for someone to be transparent with another person they have to really trust that person.&nbsp; and that usually only comes when both people are being transparent with each other.&nbsp; trusting people is a sticky situation in itself because it can lead to people getting hurt.&nbsp; now i know that if these people ever betray me&nbsp;i will be absolutely devastated, i'm not even gonna lie.&nbsp; but on the other hand, i can't live my whole entire life not trusting anybody....that'd lead to a lonely life, plus it just seems like too much work to keep all that in, but hey, that's just me.&nbsp; and the other thing that goes along with this is people and the walls they've built.&nbsp; everyone, nobody how trusting or not,&nbsp;has some type of wall that they've built in order to protect themselves. and in my opinion everyone wants someone to break down this wall....or at least try. but things get complicated when you think about the types of walls people have built and how people approach these walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;let me see if i can't explain what i mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;it's kinda like the three little&nbsp;pigs.&nbsp; some people build their walls out of straw, some&nbsp;out of sticks, and some of out of bricks.&nbsp; in&nbsp;a lot of cases&nbsp;when people try to break down the walls people have built they kind of charge at the wall and hopes it falls. if the person has built their wall outta straw or sticks, that method&nbsp;works.&nbsp; but in most cases people build walls to protect themselves from something so they build it out of something sturdy, like bricks.&nbsp; so in that case the running and charging at the brick wall doesn't work.&nbsp; and depending on the person, after running and charging at&nbsp;the wall a few&nbsp;time and&nbsp;nothing happening is reason enough to give up and not put anymore effort into breaking the walls down.&nbsp;&nbsp;when that happens that shows the person behind the wall that the person trying to break down the wall doesn't care too much about what's&nbsp;really&nbsp;behind the wall....thus giving them more reason to keep the wall up.&nbsp;&nbsp;but sometimes you get people who are a bit more patient and are willing to put in the time and effort to&nbsp;try and break down the wall by slowly chipping away small pieces.&nbsp; they realize that a wall isn't gonna come down overnight and with one or two attempts.&nbsp; but the problem with that is, most people&nbsp;usually aren't willing to&nbsp;put in the time and effort to chip away at the wall, they&nbsp;want&nbsp;immediate results.&nbsp;&nbsp;immediate results are much more gratifying&nbsp;for a couple of reasons.&nbsp; one being the person breaking down the wall feels they have accomplished something.&nbsp;and the other is chipping away at the wall is like taking a chance.&nbsp; if they put in the energy to do so and don't like what they find on the other side or it's not what they thought it was they feel as if they've wasted their time and energy....something they can't ever get back...hence why people give up after a few tries.&nbsp; but on the other hand if what's on the other side is important enough to you, you'll keep chipping away at the bricks.&nbsp; and sometimes you chip away the bricks, get a real glimpse of what's behind the wall and then the person puts new bricks in the place of the ones that were removed, and you feel as if you're starting all over.&nbsp; in my opinion if you keep chipping away at the bricks it shows the person behind the wall one of two things.&nbsp; it shows them that either you're a crazy stalker, or that you're someone who really cares enough about what's behind the wall to continue to put your time, energy and effort into breaking it down.&nbsp;now the person behind the wall may or may not ever let you really see what's back there, but&nbsp;that's just the risk you take.&nbsp; as for me, i think i'm gonna keep chipping away for a little while longer....&nbsp;"

"event","<p>i didn't go to work today.&nbsp; it was great.&nbsp; i didn't do anything really worth mentioning but it was nice being off.&nbsp;i&nbsp;madee a dentist appointment and took sick leave (seeing as i have&nbsp;like 32 sick days and only 3 personal).&nbsp; &nbsp;a couple of weeks ago i said i wanted to take a day off.&nbsp; so i decided to actually do it.&nbsp; today was the perfect day.&nbsp; monday's are always long anyways.&nbsp; plus tomorrow we have the city wide convocation, so they kids don't come to school.&nbsp; convocation consists of all of the teachers in the city going to hear a speaker who is supposed to uplift and motivate us.&nbsp; last year the speaker was decent, but the year before that i had to fight to keep my eyes open.&nbsp; so when wednesday gets here the week will be half over.&nbsp; so i'll have wednesday and thursday to actually worry about teaching and then on friday we're having our SOL parade, so that's a pretty easy day.&nbsp; the SOL parade consists of all the students in the school walking around the neighborhood playing instruments that they've made, then we have lunch and watch a movie....usually a pretty easy day. so having monday off, no kids on tuesday and the SOL parade on wednesday hopefully this will be a relatively easy week.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />why do 4th, 5th, and 6th graders have myspace pages??&nbsp; can somebody please answer that question for me.&nbsp; in the past week or so i've had two of my former students to request to be my friend on myspace.&nbsp; hell no i'm not gonna be your friend!&nbsp; and one sent me a message telling me who she was and this heffa had the nerve to call me by my first name....disrespectful.&nbsp; i'm pretty sure their parents don't know they have myspace pages.&nbsp; that's what's wrong with the world today.&nbsp; they need to get off mysapce and do their vocabulary homework.&nbsp; </p><p>sometimes in life you go through things, good, bad or indifferent and you seek the opinions of your friends.&nbsp; and often times you ask a few different friends in order to get different points of view and advice.&nbsp; i've come to the conclusion that&nbsp; some people absolutely suck at giving advice.&nbsp; when most people give advice they imagine themselves in the situation and then dispense advice according to what they'd do.&nbsp; while that's completely understandable, they forget that the person who is asking isn't them and probably won't do it that way.&nbsp;and on top of that, half the people who give you advice wouldn't/wont do what they're telling you to do anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />everyone wants something different out of life.&nbsp; i know that's not the most epiphanic thing ever said, but let me explain where i'm coming from with that.&nbsp; the other day i was in the kitchen cooking dinner for me and my roommate.&nbsp; as usual i was getting excited because i just wasn't cooking for myself (it's not fun cooking for myself, i enjoy it more when i can cook for other people) and i was telling her about it.&nbsp; she said she hated to cook, and i told her i loved cooking especially for other people.&nbsp; i told her i was looking forward to getting married and having a husband and eventually a family to cook for and take care of.&nbsp; she looked at me as if i had just cussed her out. haha.&nbsp; she told me that she's never wanted that.&nbsp; she wants to be the high profile business woman, with the three piece suits, expensive car and big fancy house.&nbsp; &nbsp;i can't relate to that.&nbsp; she and i want different things out of life.&nbsp; her wants aren't invalid, just different from mine.&nbsp; thus is life i guess.&nbsp; if we were all the same and all wanted the same thing life would be boring.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />i've had a headache for the past 3 hours.&nbsp; the whole left side of my head is throbbing.&nbsp; i hope it feels better when i wake up.&nbsp; <br /></p>"

"event","&nbsp;1.&nbsp; ""normal"" people behave a lot like the two autistic children i have in my class.&nbsp; specifically in the way they deal with stuff when things don't go their way or they're angry, upset or frustrated.&nbsp; let's look at my first student, we'll call him ""K"".&nbsp; Whenever K gets upset or frustrated or things don't go the way they should, he has a fit and a breakdown.&nbsp; he cries, screams, sometimes kicks, crawls under tables, etc.&nbsp; some ""normal"" people are the same way.&nbsp; granted they may not crawl under a table or kick things and people, but they have a fit.&nbsp; they let the whole world know that they're upset.&nbsp; on the other hand, let's look at ""T"".&nbsp; When T gets upset he shuts down.&nbsp; He doesn't talk, he won't tell you whats wrong, he just sits there and ignores the world.&nbsp; some ""normal"" people do the exact same thing.&nbsp; instead of telling you that something is wrong, they keep it all in and you figure it out by the lack of response they give you.&nbsp; i'm not sure how or when i made that comparison but i did.&nbsp; so there.

2.&nbsp; that butterflies in your stomach feeling is real.&nbsp; well, i've know that it's real, but it's been so long that i've experienced that feeling.&nbsp; it was nice to be reminded that it still exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

3.&nbsp; it's really hard trying to drive and eat a cupcake at the same.&nbsp; now that may not sound like too difficult of a feat, but let me add that the cupcake had A LOT of chocolate&nbsp;frosting that i was trying to eat and NOT get on the khaki capris i had on.&nbsp; and on top of that, i had to take the little cupcake wrapper off of the super frosted cupcake (in which i had to drive with my knew because that was a job that required two hands).&nbsp; i don't advise anyone try that, but hey you might be able to do it better than i did.&nbsp; i had chocolate frosting ALL over my face, and cupe cake crumbs in my seat. i felt like a two year old, and i'm sure i looked like one too.&nbsp; haha, good times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

4.&nbsp; i realized i never did a birthday recap.&nbsp; well i turned 24 a week ago today.&nbsp; 24 doesn't feel any different from 23, but it sounds so much older to me.&nbsp; i went to church, went bowling with some friends, went to TGI Friday's with friends and sorority sisters, and then some of them came back to the apartment for the turtle cupcake cake i made (mentioned in a previous entry....pictures to come).&nbsp; Overall it was a really good birthday.&nbsp; i enjoyed spending time with my friends and sorority sisters.&nbsp; and i can't forget to mention that my father (who insists on calling himself my ""dad "" when he leaves voicemails...that really irks the hell outta me...i've seen&nbsp;him 4 times in my life, in my book that doesn't qualify&nbsp;him as a ""dad'....but that's a completely different story)&nbsp; called me the day AFTER my birthday to wish me happy birthday and was proud of himself that he was only one day late.&nbsp;did i forget to mention that in the 24 years that i've been alive he has NEVER wished me happy birthday ON the day of my birthday.&nbsp; up until the past 4 -5 years or so i'd get birthday cards or calls around mid to late october, sometimes it'd be mid november before i heard from him.&nbsp; anyway that's not the point.&nbsp; the point was&nbsp;he was sooo proud&nbsp;of himself that he was only ONE day late. haha. bastard.&nbsp; &nbsp;

5.&nbsp; there were a couple of other things that i was gonna write about but i can't remember what they were. oh well.&nbsp; i'll be back if i remember.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

so today i was a total bum.&nbsp; i didn't do much of anything and it was great. i was apparently tired because i slept in til a little after 11.&nbsp; normally on the weekends i can't sleep past 8 or 9.&nbsp; when that happens i just wake up and watch cartoons for a couple of hours and then i usually fall back asleep.&nbsp; but at any rate, it was nice&nbsp; relaxing and not feeling like i should be doing something else.&nbsp; i didn't bring any work home this weekend, it was a birthday gift to myself.&nbsp; i'll do it on monday&nbsp;

i was trying to find a fun cake recipe on betty crocker.com (it's become one of my favorite websites) and i came across a turtle cake recipe.&nbsp; well it's actually cupcakes that you shape in the form of a turtle that ends up looking like a cake.&nbsp; when i saw it i immediately decided to make it.&nbsp; i went to the store got what i needed and set to work.&nbsp; it was fun to make, but i came to the following conclusion:&nbsp; i can bake a mean batch of cookies, but as for my cake decorating skills....well, they really suck. lol.&nbsp; my turtle doesn't look much like the one on bettycrocker.com, but i'm proud of him and he makes me happy. so although i had fun making it, i wouldn't enter it into a cake decorating contest.&nbsp; i'm sure&nbsp;it tastes good though.

not much else is new.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

I threw down to say i have plans.&nbsp; Now I just have to find the motivation to grade the GARGANTUAN stack of papers I have.&nbsp; I want to get them all graded by Tuesday so I can send them home in Tuesday folders.&nbsp; So that means I gotta find motivation from somewhere because that only leaves today and tomorrow.&nbsp; Hmm, guess I better get on that.&nbsp;I just keep putting it off because I know that it'll take FOREVER.&nbsp; -sigh- Today I was talking to one of my friends from college who is also a teacher.&nbsp; We were saying that one drawback of our job is that we always have to take work home.&nbsp; If sitting at a desk all day didn't bore me completely outta my mind and I didn't enjoy teaching so much (the parts I don't have to take home) I'd definitely think about about getting a regular old 9 to 5.&nbsp; I think I'm just feeling this way because this school year has gotten off to a rough start.&nbsp; I think once I get in the flow of things and feel caught up it won't be so bad...at least I hope so.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As most of you know, I'm a pretty happy go lucky and optimistic person.&nbsp; As much as this is true, there are times when I slip into bouts of cynicism and pessimism.&nbsp; I tend to look at everything negatively and don't have much faith in anyone or anything.&nbsp; This morning I woke up and decided that I was tired of being cynical and negative.&nbsp; That being so pessimistic was making things any easier or any better.&nbsp; And I felt that by being pessimistic I was in a way doubting the things that God could do.&nbsp; So I decided I was gonna claim victory in the situations I'm going through and walk by faith that God is going to work out things.&nbsp; I know that God loves me and I have to have faith that he's gonna bring me out of these things and that he's gonna give me things greater than I could ever imagine.&nbsp; I'm believing in that and I feel better already.&nbsp; Things haven't started to get better yet, but I know they will.... I have faith that they will.&nbsp; </p><p>Because I'm normally an optimistic person I tend to have faith in people.&nbsp; I have faith that they'll do the things they say, or that they'll be a good friend to me.&nbsp; Sometimes that's the case and sometimes it's not.&nbsp; But because I want to think the best of people sometimes I tend to overlook and forgive things that perhaps I shouldn't.&nbsp; I think in some cases people take advantage of my kindness and my wanting to believe the best about them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't like to feel that I'm giving up on people, but sometimes&nbsp;I just have to back away from a&nbsp;person because it's best for me.&nbsp; It's not that&nbsp;I care about them any less or that&nbsp;I have given up on them, it's just&nbsp; what&nbsp;I need to do.&nbsp; Sometimes that can be a hard thing for me because I tend to put other people before myself.&nbsp; But when it seems that somebody is&nbsp;only looking out for themselves and has no regard for my feelings or isn't being a good friend to me (especially if I feel I've been a good friend to them) I have to step back and put myself first, because they aren't going to.&nbsp; I have to admit, it's something I've been&nbsp;struggling with for a long time and unfortunately I've been taken advantage of.&nbsp; Yeah, it sucks, but hey I'm not perfect and that's just one of my many flaws.&nbsp; In the end, I feel good knowing I was the best friend I could be to that person...whether they appreciated it or not.&nbsp; </p>"

"event","<p>I should be doing lesson plans, but I cannot physically or mentally bring myself to do it.&nbsp; I blame this all on last week.&nbsp; Last week was the week from hell, and quite possibly the worst week i've had in my career thus far.&nbsp; Yes, it was that bad.&nbsp; And if i try to explain to you why it was so bad, you wouldn't see where I was coming from and you'd think I was being a baby.&nbsp; But I'll try, but just be warned, you're more than likely not going to understand.&nbsp; Ok, so on Monday...well Monday is just a hard day in itself becaue it's Monday for crying out loud.&nbsp; But to add to that we had a PTA meeting and of course the first PTA meeting is always Open House.&nbsp; That just means the parents come to our rooms and we explain to them what goes on and so on and so forth.&nbsp; Sounds painless right? Well it's not, because you have to put on the ""I'm so happy your child is in my class and I can't wait to work with you"" face....that in itself is extremely painful because half of their kids are little shits who don't follow directions or are as dumb as a box of rocks.&nbsp; Besides that you have parents that want to talk to you FOREVER, which equates to you and your teaching partner not leaving work until 8:40 pm.&nbsp; Bleck!&nbsp; And if that weren't bad enough, of course you have an early meeting Tuesday, Wednesday AND Thursday mornings.&nbsp; And of course those meetings are a COMPLETE waste of your time....especially when those in charge are reading to you like you can't read.&nbsp; I teach children all day, I think I've mastered the skill of reading!&nbsp; Then on Wednesday afternoon&nbsp;(the morning of the earliest meeting) the obnoxious Reading Specialist brings you a memo telling you that your dumb as f*** principal is completely changing the way you teach Reading.&nbsp; But remember ther principal has NO idea what goes on in your classroom and everything in the memo is complete and utter bulls***.&nbsp; On top of that thye haven't given me half the materials I need to be an effective teacher, anyway!&nbsp; And if that weren't bad enough, on Friday you're told by the secretary that on Monday you're receiving your 28th f***ing student! 28th!&nbsp; Did I forget to mention that the other teachers only have 26, 26, and 24 students. But I'm getting my 28th?!?!&nbsp; Did I also fail to mention that included in the 27 students that I already have are two autistic children?!&nbsp; Now, I don't mind have the autistic children in my room AT ALL.&nbsp; In fact now that their aid has them under control things are running smoothly, BUT I ALREADY HAVE 27 FREAKING KIDS!&nbsp; Not to mention I literally have nowhere to put the 28th student...seriously.&nbsp; So of course I'm angry, so I ask my principal about it.&nbsp; Do you know what this stupid S.O.B. says to me? She says she didn't count the two autistic children because they come wit an aid? WTF?&nbsp; But I'm still responsible for teaching them, grading their papers and making sure they pass the SOL BUT they don't count?! How on earth does that work.&nbsp; But wait it gets better. So then she asks me if I'd rather have inclusion (which is special ed mixed with regular ed) and as I'm walking out of the office I tell her "" At this point I don't know what I want"" (which wasn't true, because I wanted to walk out of the building right then and there) and this b***h says to me ""You'll deal.""&nbsp; You'll deal?!&nbsp; What kind of unprofessional shit is that to say to me?&nbsp;I rolled my eyes and walked outta the office.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I know that that may not sound like the makings of a crappy week to you, but it was.&nbsp; It was jsut a bunch of little things that piled up on top of each other.&nbsp; Normally something little will effect me, I let it bother me for a split second then I'll get over it, but last week I didn't have time to get over the first little thing before the next and the next and the next thing hit me.&nbsp; Teachers who have been teaching for 20 years have said that the start to the school year&nbsp;has been the worst they have ever had.&nbsp; So it makes me feel better.&nbsp; It's waaay to early in the year to be feeling&nbsp;burnt-out already.&nbsp; Is there anybody who wants to volunteer to help me grade papers?&nbsp; I'd be willing to pay you in food.....dinner?&nbsp; cookies?&nbsp; We can bargain....I'm desperate.&nbsp; Something has gotta&nbsp;give and if things don't get better soon, I'm afraid it's gonna be my sanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />At my church they've started a new ministry for young adults&nbsp;and I'm really excited about it.&nbsp; </p><p>So it seems the same topic of conversation has been coming up between me and quite a few of my friends.&nbsp; That topic happens to be our unwanted state of singleness.&nbsp; Now don't get me wrong, being single has its benefits, but most of us are ready to&nbsp;relinquish these benefits and be with somebody.&nbsp; And we're all quite confused as to why we're all so extremely single.&nbsp; And I'm so sick of people asking me why I don't have a boyfriend.&nbsp; Hell if I know!&nbsp; You tell me, because obviously I'm missing something.&nbsp; We think we're pretty good catches.&nbsp; We know, of course, that we have our flaws, I mean who doesn't, nobody's perfect, but come on....what is the problem?&nbsp;The other day the song ""Flaws and All"" by Beyonce came on&nbsp;and that sparked a conversation between my line sister and me.&nbsp; We were saying that we wanted someone to care about flaws and all and to have someone to care about us, flaws and all.&nbsp; Because we understand that everybody at some time or another sucks at life, and that's ok and even to be expected.&nbsp; I was telling her that'd it be nice to have someone not only tolerate you but to appreciate you, quirks and all.&nbsp; Because it's one thing to be able to tolerate and put up with someone else, but it's a completely different thing to be able to appreciate their idiosyncrasies and oddities.&nbsp; Obviously that has to work both ways.&nbsp;I don't want&nbsp;it to sound like&nbsp;I have this romanticized vision of relationships&nbsp; and it's all lovey dovey or whatever, because I don't.&nbsp; Relationships of all kinds&nbsp;(whether friendships or more that that) aren't easy and involve lots of work.&nbsp; What I'm saying is it'd be nice to have a person who's at least willing to try and put in the work involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe I just have it all wrong....what do I know?&nbsp; Blah, whatever....maybe I'm just meant to be single for the rest of my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meh!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok, I've said it before, but I'm saying it again. I'm getting fat. And it's not that I'm a cow or anything, I've just put on more weight than I'm comfortable with.&nbsp; I joined a gym at that beginning of this month and I need to get my lazy behind up and start going because my clothes aren't fitting they way I want them to.&nbsp; So I think I'm gonna get my life together and go next week...at least that's the plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I think I'm gonna go to bed early so I can get up early to prepare for the week.&nbsp; Because I've got to do everything I can possibly do so I don't have another week from hell.&nbsp; Not that much of last week was within my control.&nbsp; I have to stay on top of what I can control.&nbsp; I hope things are going well with everyone else thought.&nbsp; <br /></p>"

"event","<p>Yesterday was the first day back of work for me...in other words, the death to my summer.&nbsp; Despite sitting on those extremely hard cafeteria chairs for 4 hours yesterday wasn't bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of that&nbsp;probably has to do with the fact that my teaching partner, a couple of the other teachers, and I&nbsp;were making jokes, being immature and inappropriate while our assistant principal was talking about safety.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the boring recap of lots of things we already knew(bad times), and a lunch of Tropical Smoothie Cafe(good times), we were able to spend the rest of the afternoon working in our rooms. I got a lot done.&nbsp; After working all day, on the first day back no less, I thought I&nbsp;would be so tired that I would come home and fall asleep until the next.&nbsp; Surprisingly that didn't happen.&nbsp; I came home, sat down for&nbsp;a lil while, then got up to make dinner.&nbsp; While cooking dinner&nbsp; and after I cleaned out the refrigerator, ran two loads of dishes through the dishwasher, washed the ones that wouldn't fit, swept the kitchen floor, cleaned off the counters (which were a mess), cleaned the kitchen table, took out the trash, and did three loads of laundry.&nbsp; Not only did I completely clean the kitchen, but I also did the work I brought home from work (something I'm not gonna do nearly as often this year...more about that later.)&nbsp; It wasn't until about 11:30 that I relaxed.&nbsp; And when I did slow down, boy did I feel tired.&nbsp; But to top it all of yesterday was a really good day.&nbsp; There was nothing in particular that happened to make it so, I just woke up feeling good and it continued through the day.&nbsp; And apparently the feeling continued today because today was another good day.&nbsp; The staff development meetings weren't as painfully boring as I thought they were gonna be, so that was good.&nbsp; Each day I make more progress on my room so I'm happy about that.&nbsp; The only thing I have to complain about is my back.&nbsp; I forgot how standing up&nbsp;all day makes my back hurt....stupid chronic back pain.&nbsp; Back pain and all I'm looking forward to a new school year.&nbsp;</p><p>As I've stated several times before the summer was a time in which I did a lot of thinking and self-examining.&nbsp; In doing so I've decided to work on some of my flaws.&nbsp; I've also decided I'm gonna change some things.&nbsp; For one, I'm gonna exercise regularly.&nbsp; Within the last year or two my metabolism has slowed but my unhealthy eating habits haven't so it's catching up with me.&nbsp; Sometime this week or this weekend I plan on joining a gym AND actually going.&nbsp; I'll keep you updated on that.&nbsp; Another thing I'm going to change is how I deal with work.&nbsp; Yes, that's how I make a living and therefore it's important, but my job is not my life, it's simply a part of my life.&nbsp; Meaning, it doesn't have to consume me and the majority of my time.&nbsp; I plan on going in early or staying late to get my work done instead of bringing it home.&nbsp; I think by doing that my work life&nbsp;won't mesh into my personal life.&nbsp; I want the two of them to be separate entities.&nbsp; Inevitably there are going to be times in which I'm going to have to bring work home, teaching has never been a leave it at the office type of career, but I'm going to make every effort to do only do so when it's <em>absolutely</em> necessary (i.e. progress report and report card time)&nbsp; Another thing I want to improve on is being a neater person.&nbsp; Those of you who know me well enough to&nbsp;have ever seen my room know that it's pretty much a permanent state of disarray. haha.&nbsp; Sad, but true.&nbsp; I have to admit, that since moving to the apartment I have kept it pretty clean (my line sisters whole-heartedly agree).&nbsp; I'm definitely gonna try my best to keep it that way.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a couple of&nbsp;other things that I'm trying to improve on, but they're a bit more personal.&nbsp; But here's to self-improvement....&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>Yesterday my small group had a cookout at the park.&nbsp; It was pretty decent.&nbsp; We ate, talked, and played volleyball.&nbsp; So following everybody else, I took off my flip flops to play volleyball in the sand.&nbsp; It wasn't until this morning after I got outta the shower that I realized i had stepped on something.&nbsp; So I decided to be a surgeon and try and get it out myself.&nbsp; Yeah, that didn't work too well.&nbsp; So all day I walked with sort of a limp because it hurt to put too much pressure on my foot.&nbsp; This reminds me of the time i stepped on a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:SeaUrchin.jpg"">sea urchin</a>.&nbsp; It was when I was living in Italy and went to the beach with&nbsp;Jenna, my best friend at the time.&nbsp; Almost 30 seconds after I got in the water, I stepped on a stupid sea urchin.&nbsp; I got five of the little spikes stuck in my heel and two in my toes.&nbsp; I walked around for a few days with a limp.&nbsp; After that my friend's dad called me 'Spike'...in fact he still calls me that to this day. haha, good times....well not really, but at least I can laugh about it now.&nbsp; </p><br /><p>Today I went into work for a few hours.&nbsp; Actually I went in a little longer than I had planned.&nbsp; I wanted to go in and arrange the furniture so it could look like a classroom again instead of a random room with junk in it.&nbsp; My plans were foiled because the custodians said they had to take all the furniture out of my room to put another coat of wax on it.&nbsp; So there was no point in arranging the furniture for the custodians to take it all out and not put it back the way I wanted.&nbsp; So I did other little stuff.&nbsp; I started on my bulletin boards, did a little cleaning and tried to organize things in my head.&nbsp; I feel it was only a semi-productive day as far as that's concerned.&nbsp; Hopefully they waxed the floor today and I can go in there tomorrow and get some order to it all.&nbsp; If not I'll have to wait until Wednesday.&nbsp;I'm trying to get it done early in the week so I can rest the last few days before I have to go back to work.&nbsp; We shall see.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I think I've said before, I'm actually not dreading going back to work.&nbsp; If you want me to be honest, a part of me is kinda excited about the new and upcoming school year.&nbsp; I'm also ready to be on a schedule again.&nbsp; I work best with consistency and going back to work will provide that.&nbsp; My sleep will be more regulated, although I'll miss my mid afternoon naps and watching Golden Girls at 1am.&nbsp; I'll eat more regularly.&nbsp; I definitely have not been eating all that well this summer.&nbsp; The recent weight gain in my thighs and stomach can attest to that, unfortunately.&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps when I sit down to get the schedule of my life together I'll work in some exercise time...more than likely I will.&nbsp; While on the subject of going back to work...those of you who have expressed interest in me baking cookies for you better get your cookie requests in soon.&nbsp; You have two weeks, because once school starts I'll probably be too busy for the first month or so to even think about baking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It's funny how you can know someone for years but never realize how much you have in common with them.&nbsp; I was talking to my friend, and former college roommate today and we found that we have quite a bit in common as far as our personalities are concerned.&nbsp; We also tend to deal with the people in our lives in similar ways.&nbsp; We had a nice little heart to heart about the things going on in our lives.&nbsp; Well she told me what was going on in her life and I just said I understood and could relate.&nbsp; I didn't give her details, I love&nbsp;her to pieces, but she can't hold water, and I ain't tell her all my business. for her to tell the whole&nbsp;world.&nbsp;lol.<br /><br />I've been a sensitive person all my life.&nbsp; Growing up my mom was constantly telling me I get my feelings hurt too easily.&nbsp; I'll admit, it's true.&nbsp; I just don't know how to change that.&nbsp; Not only am I very sensitive and hurt easily but it takes me awhile to recover.&nbsp; I've noticed that lately, within the past six months or so, I've become more resilient.&nbsp; I'm still sensitive and hurt easily, but it doesn't take me as long to bounce back from whatever it is that has hurt me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if only I could work on not being so sensitive and easily hurt....<br /><br />I went to a hula dance lesson today!!! Oh, my gosh, it was really fun.&nbsp; As most people&nbsp;know, I'm really interested in all things&nbsp;hawaiian.&nbsp; A friend of mine from church invited me because her aunt teaches the classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&nbsp;told me just to come&nbsp;and check it out.&nbsp; I did and loved it and&nbsp;I'm gonna keep going.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was good exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok, there are a couple more things in my mind, but this week I was supposed to start getting back to a normal sleeping pattern, so I'm gonna end it here and go to bed.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll be back tomorrow to finish this mental dump.&nbsp;I get sidetracked easily, so we'll see.&nbsp; </p>"

"event","<p>Clarity can be a refreshing thing.&nbsp; Let me explain why I say that.&nbsp; Recently,&nbsp;I've been dealing with some things...well, more accurately, I've been having trouble dealing&nbsp;with some things.&nbsp; To be honest with you, it's been kind of a rough summer for me as far as that goes.&nbsp; But recently, Sunday to be exact, I received some clarity on it all.&nbsp; I was driving home from step practice just thinking and it came to me, or rather God gave it to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel he explained to me why&nbsp;I was having trouble dealing with these things.&nbsp; God even provided an analogy to make it even clearer.&nbsp; Gaining this clarity has been wonderful.&nbsp; While it doesn't diminish the pain or frustration I'm feeling, it definitely shows me that it's not all in vain.&nbsp; In the end I guess that's the most important thing.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that didn't make a whole lot of sense.&nbsp; It's kinda hard explaining it without going into more details.&nbsp; But if you're really that interested, you can ask me and I'll explain it to you, analogy and all.&nbsp; Essentially God is working in me right now, and I'll be honest with you, it's not very comfortable, but it's necessary for him to shape me into the child of God he wants me to be, so I'm gonna suck it up and deal with it.&nbsp;<br /><br />My summer break is coming to an end.&nbsp; This saddens me a bit, because I've enjoyed doing nothing and not feeling guilty because there's something else I should be doing.&nbsp; Because it's been such a relaxing summer, I'll actually won't be so sad to go back to work in a week and a half.&nbsp; I'm actually starting to get excited about the upcoming school year.&nbsp; I'll probably go in next week to start getting my classroom ready because if I wait until I have to go back to work (the 27th)&nbsp; I won't be able to get everything done.&nbsp; It's my third year and I'm&nbsp;looking forward to being a better teacher this year than I was last year.&nbsp; Another year of goofing off with my teacher partner (Jonathan) when we should be teaching and passing notes in staff meetings with Sarah should be fun too!&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the things teachers do to keep sane.&nbsp; </p><p>Someone complained that I write too much and that my entries were too long, so I'll stop here.&nbsp; (Actually I don't have anything else to say, but we'll just pretend I'm cutting it short on purpose. haha)&nbsp; </p>"

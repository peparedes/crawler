  On another note - my mum gave birth to my baby brother (shucks, and I had my hopes up for a girl! ;P) two days ago! I'm <b>SUPEREXCITED</b>, and I can't wait to meet him! His name is Alexander, and he's 21.3 inches long and weighted 6 pounds 5 ounces :D :D :D

"event","Okay... *breathes*... oookay *hyperventilates*... So my brother and I were out walking, like we usually do 'cos um... yeah, and on our way home I noticed my peace pin had fallen off my jacket. I didn't care that much 'cos it's not like I can't buy a new one, buuut my brother, being the adventurous sort, offered to run back and get it, 'cos <i>allegedly</i> he'd heard something way back, and he thought he'd seen my pin come off (which is probably true, 'cos man, he sees EVERYTHING, I crap ye not!). I tried to tell him it wasn't really necessary, and that I could get a new, and even prettier one, but he was quite adamant about it; saying that it was part of my <i>Goo Fans For Peace</i> pin collection (LOL, that sounds sooo uncool), and that I'd probably bawl my eyes out if he didn't get it, so I finally gave my consent and off he ran!
  We agreed on meeting back home, and that if he didn't find it after 5 min he would hurry back and we'd watch a movie or something. Well, I'd been home for about 40 min and he hadn't shown up still, and my dad and I were really starting to worry! Like woah! And after another 10 my dad went out to look for him, and if Martin came in I was to phone him, but he didn't, and another 10 went by and I was on tenterhooks waiting 'cos it started getting late and really dark out and who the fuck knows what might happen if a weirdo gets his dirty minces on him?!

After another 30 mins spent biting my nails off he came bursting through the door; with the tiny peace pin sitting between his thumb and forefinger, and with a triumphant grin spread thicker than jello all across his friggin' mug! My dad was right behind him, white as a sheet and sweating like a fat kid in a sweet shop! I feel so sorry for him! *hugs dad* And my brother went (still with that goddamn grin plastered all over his face), <i>""you know what? I found your pin, but I didn't feel like taking the long way back so I took the shortcut instead!""</i>... and I was like, <i>""what shortcut?!""</i>, and my dad managed to stutter: <i>""yeah, Martin, tell her aaall about the shortcut""</i> and my brother went on, <i>""well, yeah, as I said I didn't really feel like walking back through the middle again all the way from the other side, so instead I ran across the motorway...""</i> -- 

<b>ACROSS THE FUCKING MOTORWAY! AT NIGHT!</b>

Good lord, I just felt like blowing off some steam 'cos DAMN, as much as he gets on my friggin nerves I wouldn't last a day without the lil' sucker!!

*phew* There. End of rant."

  So anyway, I started school (oh my!) last Monday, and... well, that's pretty much it. Not much to add really. No new classes except History (awesome), Science (not as awesome) and Spanish (finally!). I know I'm prolly gonna break <a href='http://ladyarwen241.livejournal.com/'><b>ladyarwen241</b></a>'s heart, when I say I gave up Russian for Spanish... It's just that I feel like I'll have more use of Spanish than Russian in the future X) So far it's been great! :) My schedule's aaaaawesoooooome.

Don't wanna oversleep tomorrow, seeing as I have to leave the Land of Nod at 5:40 am(!!!)

"event","Wow, so I haven't updated in two weeks... that's pretty damn uncool of me. No excuse this time; I just haven't gotten around to do it, plus I've had nothing interesting to report :)
  Went for a checkup at the dentist's - not the regular one (ugh, the horror), but the one that keeps track on my braces and how they're doing (I've really no idea) and he informed me that I have a cavity, but I can't have it fixed right now because of my braces, sooo I have to wait, and who knows? I might even not be in pain all the time. (lol, yeah, fat chance) 
The good news though is that in about 3 weeks from now I'll be rid of braces 4 EVAH! Wh-pssh! (or however you type that whip crack noice) I'm SO happy *twirls*

Tomorrow school starts *wipes tears* Goodbye, sweet freedom - hello, slavery. Cheerio, lazy days scratching your butt (which I don't do by the way, come on GROSS!) - hola, sharpening pens; praying to Goo your prof won't notice your little bathroom break (which lasted for about 2 hours).
  It's not that bad when you think about it. I'm taking Russian classes this year, WOOT! And time for Italian once again, which I love, so it's all GOOd.

I'm off to bed now for an early start at 6 am tomorrow! GOOD NIGHT, sleep tight and all that! *snuggles flist*

"event","Ugh, please excuse any grammatical boo-boo's found in this entry; I'm too tired for spelling X| 

<lj-cut text = ""putting this behind a cut to keep from effing up your journals ^^""> 

First I've yet to tell you about the lack of updates and the general lack of communication (I'm really sorry about that). I don't wish to be a whiny hiney, but I just have to vent about it a bit -- it seems that the pain I occassionally felt just weeks after the jaw surgery has returned, and it's even worse this time. It's a sort of dull pain that progressively starts in the lower jaw, then increases; building into sharp, stabbing pains that spread throughout the left side of my head. It feels like having John Bonham (drummer in Led Zeppelin) pounding a 2 hour long drumsolo in your head, after which he proceeds to poke one of his drumsticks through your eardrum, repeatedly. 
  And this time I can't really do much about it, 'cos the painkillers I previously used were available on prescription only, and I've only two left, and everytime I feel like I *have* to take one I can't, 'cos I want to save them if things should get worse, so all I've got are some lighter ones, which I can't take too many of, and no longer than for a 5-day period. I know I should've called the dentist a loooong time ago about this, but the thing is that I'm sort of...um... scared-shitless-'cos-I'm-kind-of-dentophobic XP 
  But, after some serious thinking I've decided to give my dentist a ring on Monday, ehm, tomorrow that is *bites nails* OHGOSH, what if this is really not post-op pains but toothache, and I have to get all my teeth pulled and replaced with false teeth?!!? Shit like that <i>does</i> happen, who says it can't happen to me?!


...also, I'm slightly paranoid. Slightly. Moving on, I might add that said lack of communication stems not only from the jaw issue, but from the fact that I was kidnapped-- yes, kidnapped! - by my grandparents two weeks ago, because they reckoned I spent too much time in front of the pooter, which is true, but still. They claimed the salty air of the sea would do me good, and I decided to join them, after a bit of persuading. (Let me tell you: hell hath no fury like a grandmother's scorn)

Apart from that, I haven't any updates really-- although I might tell you that on my afternoon walk two days ago a wasp decided it'd be a dandy idea to hitch a ride in my top (without my knowing), and you know what the fucker does? He stings me! Right where the ribs meet, and I went ""aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh"", and started jumping up and down (for some reason), and the bastard falls out of my top and hits the ground, and then I started screaming even more 'cos it's not a petit gentleman we're talking about here, but one of them big fuckers; looked more like a huge hornet than a wasp actually. Anyway, I started feeling dizzy and had to run home to call my dad, who's terrified of wasps, so naturally he got all panicky; thinking I was gonna go west so to speak, which caused me to panic even more, but then he told me to call grandma and I did and she calmy told me that I wasn't gonna check out just yet, and that I just needed to dab some vinegar on it, and after that things were fine. I'm won't be wearing any low-cut tops in a good while though, I might add. I'm all polo shirts from now on. 

I think I need to stop writing now, hehe, sorry. I've gotta dash to check all your updates, 'cos goo knows I've missed A LOT!

Sorry again *huggles flist*

"event","A quick update from shitty Oslo. Aww, no, it's not that shitty really, I guess, it's just that I barely had any sleep at all on the train, and when we finally arrived (two hours later than we'd been told) my dad and I started feeling really sick, and we literally had to hold on to each other to keep from falling over and vomit like there was no tomorrow. Meanwhile my brother felt fresh as a daisy and wasn't bothered at all, lucky bastard, so at least he made it through.
  But after a lifetime spent sitting on various park benches; feeding birds (you know the really tiny ones: sooo cute), and trying to avoid the smell of my brother's pizza slice, we finally started to feel a bit better, so off we were on a sightseeing that seemingly went on forever. 
  Dad gave me and Martin (the brother obviously) some Norweigan money to spend, and while Martin went off in search of ""I love Oslo"" writing on an array of different items: t-shirts, plushies, wallets, poscards, you name it; did what was most true to my slightly demented nature-- went (/ran as my life depended on it) off in search for the nearest record store to find meself some nice ol' Goo albums, cos I've only got the latest one (Let Love In) & Dizzy Up The Girl, buuuut to my great despair it turned out that not a single store had those precious items in possession -- not any of them - that is, the TWO record stores that exist in Oslo. Yes. TWO. I crap you not. How is that even possible?? Shitloads of Deli de Luca's, 7eleven's, H&M's - but only two bludeh record stores, and both were called ""freerecords.no"".

Oops, it seems that my quick update's turned into one of those longwinded ones (i.e. my usual ones). Sorry. I've nothing to do and the train leaves in *checks time* 2 hours.
  Oh well, I can't wait to get home and sleep in a proper bed! It's been fun though, despite everything, and yeah.. that's pretty much it.

"event","Hi guys *squishes*

Came home Tuesday night: sunburned, dog-tired and dehydrated, so I pretty much went straight to bed (after watching Midsomer Murders though, cos I love that show :D), and the day after, hum, that'd be yesterday *scratches head thoughtfully* I went to see PotC 2 with two of my mates, and after seeing it I was completely awestruck. Couldn't get a word out of me if my life depended on it. Usually after seeing a highly anticipated movie we discuss it afterwards for hours and hours, but this time we had to settle for ""wow"", ""shit"" and the F-word. I don't wanna piss on it by saying it was good cos yeah, it was, but it was faaaar more than that. 
  Can't wait to see it again!! Those of you who haven't seen it; go immediately! You're in for a REAL treat!

Tonight I'm going away again *sniffs* I don't want to go anywhere right now! I just want to stay home, reading, writing, drawing; all the things that don't involve movement of any kind, but alas, I'm off again and this time to Oslo, Norway (for some reason). The train leaves at 10:30 tonight, so we're gonna sleep there! It's gonna be pretty fun cos I've never slept on a train before, y'know, proper sleep. And I've never been to Norway either so I should really shut it and just enjoy the trip. There. I love reprimanding myself.

I've 15 PotC icons behind the cut, and two headers/banners/slkghahjf, cos PotC related stuff's seemingly all I do these days ^_^

Also, I'd like to thank <lj comm=""atanone""> for keeping me entertained during these past two weeks with her lovely SMSes -- thank-oo, luv *smooches*

Ok, so I know that technically I'm supposed to be far away; sitting on an islet goo-knows-where, rawking out to teh Goo and the sound of crickets churping, buuut, my dad had to go back home to fix a few things, and of course I didn't say no to a quickie with the pooter, so here I am. 
 Went 'awwwww' for several minutes (I crap ye not) when I saw a new pic of Johnny Goo from the video shoot of ""Let Love In"", & even though the pic's awfully blurry, I had to go and
make sumthin' of it anyway, being the graphic ho I am. Aaaaand I kind of wanted to put together another batch of PotC icons, since I'm seeing it next week and I'm soooo excited! 

I hope you're all having an awesome summer! <lj comm=""Atanone"">'s keeping me updated on what's getting down over here, so I'm pretty much covered, I think. 
  To all the americans: HAVE A GREAT 4th of July! :D

  Honestly, what've I been up to? Well, first of all I've nearly spent all my days out and about, doing various thing with various people (none of it criminal, so at least my conscience's clear on that point), and well, I've had a great time actually, but I've sort of missed just kicking it at home in front of the pooter, cuz I feel like other people've constantly tried to planned my hols, which annoys the living daylight outta me (and that was put far nicer than I intended it to be). No harm done though, I guess.

Yeah, that's right-- I failed to mention that back then... a couple of weeks ago my dad got me my first guitar, cuz I'd been bugging the hell outta him trying to get one, and I finally did, and it's beooootifooool! It's an acoustic one, and it's black *eyes pop out heart-shaped* It's so incredibly beautiful I nearly cried when I saw it.
  We did get to learn how to play in the 5th grade, but it's been a while and most of the chords had fallen out of memory. Learning to play now was kinda like learning how to ride the bike all over again, but it's been great fun, though pretty frustrating during the first week when my fingertips where practically on their knees, begging for rescue. Now they've gotten used to it, and I tell ya, they'll never be the same. 
  Before: soft - Now: calloused

Mmmmhm. Leathery. Niiiice.

Sorry, got a bit carried away there.

In two days I'll be off again, but this time for about 2 weeks(!!) HELL YAH, IT'S INSANE! I don't know how I'll ever make it. I really sense the feeling of impending doom hanging over my head, which is creepy, but I seriously don't know how I'll make it for two weeks without a computer.

Yah, you heard me. I'm going with my whole family to our summer cottage. Our summer cottage in the country. In the country way out in the archipilago, outside Stockholm, which basically means; outhouse, shitty/or no mobile reception, and most importantly: NO POOTER. 

*sniff* No GOO updates for two weeks. No LJ. No nothing *bursts into tears*

I'm gonna cope though, cuz as much as I'm gonna miss the pooter, I also know I'm gonna have an amazing time! I live and breathe for that bleedin' house, and my neat little garden, and my pretty pretty strawberry bed, and my lavender plants, and the fresh air, and the sea.

Anyways, I'll update one or two more times before I go, so don't think you're rid of me just yet ;D

And here's the real update, the real deal -- Instead of putting together another one of them banner thingies, I've thrown together -- hold on, wait for it -- two WALLPAPERS. GOO WALLPAPERS. Oh my god, what's up with that? For me that's kinda of a red letter day, cuz I don't do wallpapers that often these days.

I know you're not insanely into teh Goo, like some crazy people I've heard of *clears throat noisly*, but I kinda hoped you might like them anyway *shuffles feet*

Here goes:

Wooosh. I hope you dig. And also wishing all of you a fabulous day! You're the best.
Now, shower, then head off to have a picnic lunch with some of my friends.

"event","Goddamn, it's been so damn hot the past few days that I haven't felt like doing anything. Last week the weather was so shitty I thought it was gonna stay that way forever, but then I woke up the day before yesterday and the sun was practically burning its way through the walls. Hot and humid, that's what it is. S'not that I wanna complain, I mean, I loooove summer, but damn, what a turn. Takes a while getting used to.

Another thing I've thought about, and this is gonna sound silly but I've really thought it through, and well, I don't wanna grow up. I'll turn 18 next year and I don't feel like it. I wanna stay 17 forever; y'know, pay half the price on buses, get discounts at... I don't know... Disney World; I wanna roam the streets of Stockholm with my friends and sing at the top of my lungs without having anyone questioning it... we'd be excused since we're young, and we're prone to do that -- you're supposed to do that when you've got the whole world in your pocket.

Yeah, I know, it's stupid really... I mean, there's a part of me that wants to grow up, but the real reason behind why I don't is work. Ugh... I mean, summer hols rule and it's not something I'd be willing to give up just like that. Work. Work? I don't feel like working. No, I feel like becoming filthy, stinking rich. That's what I feel like.

That's the end of my mini-rant *nods happily*

Now I'm gonna return to being filthy, stinking broke and read my not-so filthy, stinking ""Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates"" by Tom Robbins. I got it from the library yesterday and I'm ejoying it so far. Just felt like sharing XD

Here's my Gooey fix for today:

Freedom rocks.

And for all of you still in school/work; Hang in there! There's a lot to smile about, and summer's here for Goo's sake! *huggles*

On another note, I'm feeling pretty lousy right now cuz the numbness I've been feeling in my jaws and around that area has started to fade, and with that (apparently) comes a whole lotta pain ... they never mentioned that actually, but when my dad asked them today they were like ""oh, that's completely normal... bla bla bla..."" and something about nerve fibres and shit. So I've been taking painkillers against it, but that doesn't really help long so I have to take several of them which makes me feel plastered and completely off my rocker... Ugh, I hope it won't last long. I didn't really go through any serious pain after the surgery; it's only now that's it's starting to wash over me like Goo knows what.

Spent some time with PS when I was feeling all tipsy, and the outcome's all Goo (see, even when I'm feelin pissed off my wits I'm predictable XD). Thought I'd share it with you... (textures by the awesome <a href=""http://gender.livejournal.com/""><b>gender</b></a>)

I've been such a lazy bum today. Just lying on my ass, letting the sun bake my skin. Meanwhile, the only exercise I've had is basically moving from the computer to the tv a couple of times ... I'm having a really guilty conscience about it now though, so I decided I was gonna pull my thumb outta my ass and go out for a walk with my dad or something... He was all like ""sure thing, bring it on"" about it, but I haven't warned him yet-- my walks are long walks. The last one about 3 hours, so I'm not sure he's up for it.

Anyways, need to get going! Have a great night and eat lots of chocolate! *huggles flist*"

"event","Hi, long time no see again. Finally all of our national tests are over, along with every single project and homework test, ugh... 
*takes deep breath* I'm afraid I'm totally gonna wreck my karma by doing this, but hey, I need to get it out of my head somewhere... Beware, here's my charming emolicious entry; and I'm putting it behind a cut for those of you who'd rather do.. well, basically anything else far more interesting.

<lj-cut text = ""Goo Goo Dolls show and emo tears""> 

I went to see the Goo Goo Dolls last night. I forgot to tell you that I won a meet & greet pass as well, so I was given the opportunity of meeting them. It only lasted about 10 secs, cuz we were literally pushed forward in groups of four, shook hands with the band, took a pic and then it was all over. I barely had time to say 'hi', before I was ushered out. But I did get to shake hands with them, which was amazing, and seeing Johnny up close... wow, when I first saw him he looked so out of this world, you know... And this sounds weird, but most of the time you see celebrities as a concoction of what the media chooses to show you... He's got a great smile. Really, really great.
  The show was great though, but being the emotinally disturbed emokid I am that's not the end of it. Okay, I'm really sorry about this, but I just felt like I had to share it with someone. 

The thing that makes me different from ""normal"" people is, that instead of looking back on yesterday with a sheepish grin plastered all over my face, I sit at home, crying. And here's the emo-part: 
I loved the show, but I'm so sad it's over, cuz to be honest, how many chances do I get seeing my favourite band live? Honestly. If I lived over in the US I'd go on roadtrips throughout the entire place, just to see, hear and feel them, but I don't, and it's so friggin' unfair. 
Yesterday I got to see them live for the first time in my life, and it was beyond anything I'd ever imagined. I won't even try to put it into words, cuz I'm afraid they'll remain just words, and I don't wanna ruin it like that. For the first time in my life, even for the shortest time, everything felt perfect, and somehow - I don't know - in place? 
And now that's it's over I won't be able to look back on it and smile, cuz I'll start crying again, because it was my one shot at seeing them, probably my only shot ever. 

You'll probably think I've got some emotional disorder, or that I'm being such a teenaged emokid, and that's probably true, but I can't help feeling so... depressed, and it's really, really hard going through. I just thought you'd sorta be able to see what I'm going through, or something.

Ugh, I hate myself for posting this, and putting you guys through it, but I just had to.
And I know I'm being self-centered crying over something as trivial as music when there are people out there who're going through things far more severe.

Anyways, we had our last test in English today, and after that I had nothing to do just waiting around so I had to steal-- I mean borrow, my mate's STABILO Point 88 pens and  scribble nonsense on my hand, I mean, heellooo, what else??
I really love those those pens. I mean, really, really love. I spend way too much time scribbling stupid things in stupid notebooks and on my stupid skin to *not* have those pens meself. If anyone of you are sitting on a stack of those pens, or if they're just lying around doin' nuthin', you're more than welcome to send me some!
  So, without further ado I give you 'Pernilla's insane love for Goo, scribbled on insanely pale skin, and immortalized in a crappy webcam shot'

Again, sorry for being so emo but I'm really not feeling swell right now :/

"event","Hehehe, it's funny that most of the entries so far have contained an excuse for my lack of updates. Right now, we have a bunch of things going on in school... national tests, projects and whatnot, and adding to that I have a lot of things going on in my mind... mainly family related stuff that I won't even begin to dig deeper into; just because it'll bore you to death. My family's got a lot of drama queens in it. I think we got it from our mother's side, but I've always taken after dad more, so I'm a lot more calm and collected, erhm, yeah ^^;
Sooo, rather than going on a hiatus (which I won't be able to hold), I've popped in here now and then, so there ^^ Bear with me, guys *smooches flist*

L'anywhooo, even though I've been a stranger here lately doesn't mean I've stopped fooling around in PS. Quite the contrary, so this post will contain a looot of stuff, that is, compared to what I usually post ^^

Most of it is all Goo, then there's a little bit of LotR, and PotC2, a few of my entries in the Emmy Rossum challenge aaand some more. A wallpaper and a couple of those banner thingies as well, and a polaroidish Aragorn thingy, and oh-- two A/A and E/F wedding photos, kind of. Um, yeah, I'm sooo descriptive XD

Hope you like, guys!! <3 uuuu *snuggles flist*

THE GOO GOO DOLLS ARE COMING TO STOCKHOLM TO PLAY AT THE BERNS HOTEL ON MAY 23rd!
They're my favourite band in the whole world and, basically, my whole cd collection is all Goo! The cds, the dvds, t-shirts.. you fucking name it I've sure as hell got it! 
I've never seen them. Never ever, and now I will. I'm so happy. I cried so hard I got a nosebleed, 'cause I'm insane like that. I'm still crying actually.

I've been really busy this week, seeing friends and family and... well, I did do a tiny bit of studying but those few minutes aren't even worth taking into account XD

Before my dad shoos me off the computer I wanted to post something I put together for <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ladyarwen241/""><b>ladyarwen241</b></a>, since she was such a sweetheart, helping me prepare for the italian test (which my prof hasn't corrected yet, but it felt really, really good, except those bloody irregular imperatives... can't possibly tell you how much I hate them!). It's A/A, of course ;), and the words, which aren't very readable I guess, are from David Gray's ""This Year's love"" ^^ I hope you like it, honey! *SMOOCH*

"event","OMG, it's been almost a month since last I posted! A month! Can you seriously believe that? Wow, where the hell have I been all this time?! 
Most of you know that the surgery went well, and that I've been on a liquid diet for 4 weeks now, since my jaw is wired shut. It's been tough but I got used to it pretty quickly, so it hasn't been all that bad. Anyways, they're removing the wire tomorrow, so I'm probably gonna celebrate that with a huge pizza. It's gotten so bad I can't even seem to recall the taste :S Mostly 'cause I've been trying hard not to think about it, I guess :P

I went to see ""V for Vendetta"" last Wednesday and OMGWTFBBQ, it's amazing! Bloody brilliant! I went to see it yesterday as well, and it rawked even harder the second time! I can't wait to see it again! I'm so in love with V. Seriously, I've got a thing going for masked men, definitely. Um, so, to celebrate this new obsession I've fixed a new layout *points* 

I hope you guys have had a great time during my absence, and please, let me know how things are going, ok? 

There's a bunch of icons and a wallpaper behind the cut. I *really* hope you like them!

*snogs flist*

"event","Hi guys!

This is a really super-speedy entry before cutting-up-time, sorry I'm being morbid ;P The surgery's tomorrow morning, so I've gotta get up really early. I just wanted to stop by to tell you guys that I'll miss you SO much, and that I'll think about you a lot and I hope you have a kickass time while I'm gone. Now, I know I'm only gone for a week or so, but it feels like forever! 

I left you some icons from various fandoms behind the cut, and a collage I put together while ago. It's not much but I hope you'll like them!

Hugs, kisses and chocolate to all of you!
*MWAH*

"event","Long time no tacos. Sorry, I'm really, *really* tired so I've no control over what I'm writing.

Um... This week's been good, but all that was sorta crapped on after I payed a visit to the dentist yesterday (oooh, how I love them). This time they were supposed to glue on some hooks onto the wire, that I'm gonna need after the surgery after they've attached my upper jaw to my lower jaw (sounds fun, doesn't it), but the big fooker himself had to stop for a moment, after several complaints from the nurses that I was turning a not-so-charming green. He didn't stop trying to shove that stupid wire into my mouth though; not realising I was practically screaming in pain, (cause my gums's reeeally sore after the last time I had my braces tightened), but he gave up when I almost fainted. And that's the truth, I kid you not. So, he had my appointment rescheduled. Lucky me, eh?

For those of you who don't know, I'm going through jaw surgery 'cause my jaws don't meet the way they're supposed to at the front of my mouth. I didn't have to do it, 'cause it wasn't dead important and so on, but I chose to do it myself so I guess I'm gonna have to suffer. Lol, that sounded awfully depressing. It'll all be over soon though 'cause my last (and most extensive) operation's due on March 7th, and after that I'm all done and I'm gonna look different as well, so that's gonna be exciting ^^

I'm gonna post a small batch of LotR icons tonight, and they're all the same style 'cause I felt like doing it and it was fun, and something different from what I usually do, so I really hope you like it! *squee*

"event","Today hasn't been the best of days. As soon as I woke up this morning, after tossing and turning for hours in bed, I knew it was gonna be one of those days, you know. And oh, how incredibly right I was; when I managed to crawl my way to the bus stop, without falling on my ass (yaay!), the bus had been cancelled, for one reason or another, so I had to wait for the next one. Nemas problemas, I thought, after another five the next bus showed up, but by the time I reached my next stop that bus chose not to show up at all, neither did the next one. Jolly good, right? So when I finally reached the bleedin' school I'd missed 15 minutes of literature class, which sucked. 
I had a dentist appointment yesterday, that I was sooo close missing btw, and they tightened my braces, which is nothing out of the ordinary, but this time it would appear they've chosen a wire-thingy that's in fact too tight, so I've been having a bitch of a headache all day, just to make this party even better ... gaaawd!
But don't get me wrong, I really did try to be a good sport about all this, cause deep inside I'm an optimist-- yeah, honestly, ask anyone! I tried to see things in a more cheerful light and not let my gloominess infect the people around me, but my trying to be nice resulted in everyone else giving me the finger, literally. I guess they were having a lousy day as well, but argh! Seriously, they couldn't've chosen a more kosher day to piss on my riff?
I know you shouldn't take what everyone says say to heart, but I do. I always do, cause I'm overly sensitive and daft like that ;P


I do have a couple of good bits about today that hasn't been tarnished, though. I've even taken the liberty of putting together a little list: Ahem *clears throat noisily* 
""Pernilla's list of solos that hasn't been crapped on, as of yet""
1. My hair ^^ Yeah, I had a good hair day today *happeh* 
2. I finally understand the object pronouns in italian, which is awesome, cause I didn't get it at first - with all the different forms and exceptions - and I seriously thought I was gonna die trying.
3. Led Zeppelin. I love Led Zeppelin. They're the awesomest band in the history of awesomeness! ^^ *ehs evehn mawr happeh*

I'm probably gonna try to get some sleep now, and when I wake up things'll be great, right? ^^;"

It's not my intention being selfish and all but I can't help it right now.

She told me she wouldn't wanna be made into some glory all-that fancy character in a story that ended badly... And that it was the lamest thing one could do. The thing she didn't realise was that I was being serious. My being serious is quite an unusual thing. I really think that higly of her. She's an array of all those things worth mentioning, if not more, and I love her more than she'll probably ever realise. And now it's gone forever, and there's nothing I can do about it. 
She told me she didn't care about any of the fuckers she used to call her firends, and that she really tries not to care about me either... and that it actually works sometimes.

She haunts me in my every though, and every song I've ever connected to, and when I fall asleep she's in my dreams, every single night somehow, and I wish for nothing else than for her to vanish into smoke and sugar, but I can't. 

I'm sorry, I don't wanna make you depressed but I just can't see how I'll make it through... Not right now anyways."

HE WON!! WE DID IT!
I'VE NEVER SPENT MORE TIME VOTING XD

I thought Orlando'd win 'cause last I checked, he had like 102000 votes... BUT-- apparently something fishy had been going on with the voting system so he dropped like, 4 places... Alan Rickman came in as number 2... Sean Bean as number 3 AND MOST GORGEOUS MAN EVER came in as lucky number 1! He really deserves it. I'm so happy and so surprised right now :')"

I was gonna participate in a fanfic challenge over at <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/potoinspiration/""><b>potoinspiration</b></a>, so I had a lil' plot kind of set up in my mind, and then I wrote it. Problem is, after half the time I decided the shit I'd written was way to fluffy, so I had to change it; resulting in my writing a whole new story, but this time a dark one. So, when I was gonna post it yesterday I didn't know which one of the two stories to post so I went for a middle course i.e. mixing the suckers together! 
Lemme tell you, that was the worst idea I ever got. I couldn't finish the goddamned thing yesterday 'cause I was tormented by a headache from hell, so I managed to prolong the deadline to 3 pm today. I had it finished and posted by 3 pm sharp, and it's the worst piece of crap I've ever written! 
I really tried to blend the two plots but to no use! It's terrible, and right now I'm so disappointed in myself and really embarrassed."

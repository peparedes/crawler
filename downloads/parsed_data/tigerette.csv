"event","my summer is goin so fast! all my friends are doin their thing and i dont get to see them very much, and thats sad. like they are all doin stuff together and i could go but i always have plans. i have bible school at my church this week and it is realy fun. the little kids are so funny and MESSY! but thats ok cause that mean ryan can stay and help clean up too and that means more time with him. ryan is so good to me and i dont know what i would do without him! i guess i dont realize some of the time how sweet he is to me. my summer readin is comin really slow. my mom is takin me to the school and im gettin notes on them!!! haha im still readin them though... sorta"

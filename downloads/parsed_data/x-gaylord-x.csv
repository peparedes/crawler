"event","Hii ! Riiight. 

Friday.
The nan was in a good mood, so she took me shoppingggg! Yesssssss. So I got things for Freda's party. It was rather fun tbh, you wouldn't really think it with a nan, but NEVERMIND! hmm yeah so we got back, and realised we needed foodddd, so we went to ASDA.

And you know when you really really hope you don't see anybody, and you always do ? Yeaah I saw Gareth. and Tom Murphy. ahaha I went to the nan ""Look. Thats gareth. The tall one"" and she went ""SHIIIIT. he really IS tall."" and it was sooo loud that he actually turned around and saw us. -.- and then she said ""that's niiice. He's taking his brother out swimming"" and I was like. yes. best mate not brother. 

But other than that, Friday was poooo. But I got a lie in, so it's all gravy.

Then it was Saturdaaaay. Ehh. Freda and Becky went to the Trafford Centreeee and apparently it was packed, so they didn't buy anything really. I just went up Highfield (and prayed I wouldn't get mugged/raped/stabbed - Highfield = not so glam) and stayed up thereee with Jess and everyone. Fuck knows why. I can't even stand half of her mates. 

Then SUNDAY! Shinyface's birthday. 
I went online at like 8, because grandmother awoke me. UGGGH! and at like 11.30 I still had LOOADS to do. I was well panicking. lol

So Freda said she was picking me up at 1, and I was like. Hello, I'm not 5. I can make my own way there. But then I thought ""well my hairs nice today"" so I thought fuckkkk it and got the lift. but ofcourse. Big gust of wind as I left the house. 

EEE it was just Freda's mum on her own, argh. She's seriously the most boring woman alive. So we went for Beckyyy. and I was like delighted when she came. Thennn we went back for Harriet. Who was still doing her hair lolol. I actually LOVE Harriet. She's mega. 
So we were mad raving in the car and ""Nessaja"" came on, and that was itttt! We were going bonkers.  but the pictures didn't really come out. Heres one for good measure.

So we gotttt there. and we were early, so we wasted the money I was gonna give to Freda on 10p machines. :D Picture of Harriet being gay.

</center>

Errr then Freda and her mates from primary school arrived. GODD they are BORING. So we went to our two bowling lanesss and bla bla did bowling. We had the side barriers up aha so yeah. I won though ! :D yeah then we went to the arcades again.

You know those simulation machines. That are like a little car that you go on rides and get shook about on? YEAHH we went on one of those. We only payed for one person, and it was me, Freda and Nikki. So me and Nikki stood up until it started. aha CLEVER! And I still have a sore arse because of it, and apparently there was an audience around the ride cos of our screaming. Nevermind.

Then we went to Freda's and had food. EHHHH pizza. So I didn't eat. Levi and Amy (two of shinyheads mates) went on MSN. OOOOH my god. Lame !

I'm really starting to like this song aha. 
Right ok ! TuesdayWednesdayThursday.

<u>Tuesday!</u>
Riight. First period is German, which is usually a recipe of severe boredom because we have one of those teachers who thinks you <b>really</b> enjoy the lesson, when infact the situation is quite the opposite. BUT! We had a sub teacher, which is always good cos we get to move and sit where we want. It was sooo fun because me, Phil and H (I swear I should be a boy at times lmaoo) were making really obnoxious noises, and Phil did this spack voice and spat EVERYWHERE. ahahah it was disgusting and incredibly funny at the same time. He went ""Ooh that's not nice."" Which has been our thing all week. Then we started calling everybody imagineable, leading back to the reflective shimmer on Freda's fod. Very enjoyable lesson and not a bit of German in sight. Hoorah!

Then it waaas. Science. aa I hate Science right now. Rocks. Ughhh. Sedimentation? Igneous? Fuck you? So yeah really uneventful. Me, Lazarara, Lucie and Tom would most probably of talked all through it. Then it was break.

Thenn it was History. Ackk, another really plop lesson. I'm not being funny, but WHY would anybody take that as an option?! Especially at our school. We have more sub teachers than actual teachers. Nothing remarkable happened there.

Then it was French ! I lovelovelove French on a tuesday, because I'm sat next to H and everyweek he keeps me entertained, without fail. I'm also just behind Gareth and Hayley FC, so it's all gravy. All me and H seem to do is gay voices and dances, and that thing where you stare and see who laughs first. He's a very special boy. *taps his head* Aha we managed to get ourselves half hour detentions, but H didn't get one :OO so yeah. 
eeerm. OH YEAH at the end of the lesson, Miss decided to give us like 5 minutes talking, pretty pointless tbh cos it was dinner next. :/ but it was fun anyway. Gareth's taller than me when he's sat down on the table. =| Really quite scary. He seems to think my smallness is cute. Yeah ok, mountain boy. Then I felt like a <i>riiight</i> twat because that stupid prank got played on me. You know, that ""If you're hand is biiger than your head you have cancer"" one, where they go ""put your hand infront of your face."" and I did, and they go THWACKKK. Ahaha so I did it to Freda and nearly knocked her head off. =]

I can't remember what happened at Dinner. Couldn't of been that remarkable.

Right then last it wassss. Maths ! Hmm yes I'm amazingly good at maths. OOH PYTHAGORAS ! WHAT FUN !

<u>Wednesdayy!</u>
AHGAAHaHahaHAHAhAHAHAHSAHAHAHA. It was crazy hair day for sycamore house (yeah, theres four houses; Sycamore, Beech, Ash and Oak. YES ASHHHHH.) and oooomng ahhaha. Some people looked like RIGHT idiots. :]

So me and Lazarara went to Mr Flynn first thing to see about our new drum timetable, we actually gonna get to learn the drums now, not everything else imagineable. !! And the guy was ILL. AAA. Lol.

So anyway, Science. Lucie had a biggg massive frizz head and it was petrifying. But yeah, we had to watch videos on Limestone. Yawn. Big up music+headphones.

Then it was Musicccc and it was rather ok actually. They make the lesson so POOOOO.
Break.

Then it waaa Geography. BORINGBORINGBORING. I really do NOT care about most lessons at the moment. I'd rather stay in bed all day aha.

Then it was French. Ackkk. I hate French without H, aha. Usually theres Gareth to bum upto with Robert, but he moved next to Phil.

THOUGH THOUGH. Me and Hayley FC got sent for the French books because Phil and Gareth failed miserably getting them. And they were in our Maths room. (We have maths in ML3 cos we're SMART.) so we skipped down the corridor, and realised it was Year 10 Express Maths, so me and Hayley FC were being DEEEEAD gay and I ran (fell) in and said (in an oprah voice?) where are the books etcetc. It was really fun aaaand alot of the Year 10s pointed and laughed. *shrug* but I saw Danielllla which was good. 
ahaha then we were walking back to French with the books and Hayley went. ""Drop them !"" and I went no. So she held them, and I went ""WOOOOOOPS!"" and knocked them all flying. They were EVVVERYWHERE. ahaha funfunfun!

Dinner. Me and Kaisha were the only ones of us lot to brave the cold weather annnd we had a bottle fightttt. Then me and Amy Long laughed at Moby cos we tripped him up. fun.
Then last it wassss. DT. !! We've been soldering ! Well good fun tbh ! Louise was helping me with mine because I didn't have a clue cos I missed last lesson due to stupid fucking hospitality. Then Gareth joined us and sat with us for a whille. Which was good. Thenn he asked me to hold his little thing (aha I could re-word that but I'm choosing not to) whilst he soldered it, and I sneezed just as he was doing so, and he wouldn't let me help him anymore ahah. Thenn after he'd done it, we had a pennn fight. < /mature > and I caught Gareeeths neck and he said ""I HATE YOU!"" and I did the ""I HATE YOU MORE!"" routine. Funn! 

After that we had the detentionnn. Ahahaha best detention EVER! Gareth was forging his IEN card thing changing the 1 to a 3 and he was struggling so I geniously said, change it to a 4! ahaha It looked WELL convincing. So yeah, we had to sit on different tables in Art for this DT. Then Me and Gareth and Freda kept talking, so Gaaareth had to stand in the corner and it looked like he was having a weeeeee. Then two year 7s came in and we bullied themmm. Thenn Miss was signing cheques and Gareth randomly went ""Write me a cheque miss"" aahahah really gay and inappropriate. Miss went MAAAAD. So it went proper deathly silent, and I looked at Freda and she was just staring at the wall being boring, so I looked at the clock and we had like 10 minutes left, So I turned around and looked at Gareth and he was like pissing himself, causing me to blurt out this REALLY loud laugh out, therfor me and Gareth engaging in a laughing fit. We have another detention on Monday.

Today!
Science agaiiin. We had a test and I copied everybody. :]
Dramaaa. Quite like drama. Gareth said to me and Louise ""Do your play"" and we were like, um why? Confusing.
Break.
Maths. aahaha yeah really fun lesson today. I cba explaining anymore lol.
English. Again ! FUNNN. Even though Gareth (who's cropped up alot in this lj) was being really quietttt and lately I've turned into a right worry pot and I was like ""WHAT IS WRONG."" and he eventually started talking. So I coloured his hand in orange. ^.^
Then it was Dinner. 
And then it was p.e

and then it was home.

I'm SO grateful for teachers training tomorrow, I don't think I could face getting up early tomorrow.

Another life holds its weary head
We hope, we try, we live, survive

Waiting for the calling
Anticipation in the air
We hope and dream of difference
City sleeping, unaware</center>

mmm Comeback Kid !

Right so. Today has been <b>really</b> fucking boring. 

Walking to school was really gay tbh. Have you ever noticed that, when you want your headphones in to listen to music and stuff, people <i>constantly</i> talk to you, but when you take them out, nobody speaks?!?!?! 

So weee got to school. And Shaun (turdhead) went ""Hello Stacey. See, I'm being nice. HI STACEY!"" and I went ""eheheh fuck off. :D"" ahah yeah I don't get the point in it at all really. Then MissWilliams (p.e) walkied past us and said ""Stacey and Co, I need a word"" so we went ""Ok."" and walked off.

Soo in form. Nothing that exciting. Unless you call Terry burping exciting. 

So we went to English, and we were sat there talking and stuff like you do, and Joe came to the door and said ""Can I have Stacey please, for hospitality."" and I was like ghghfjdugyryfhtyvnbhd. So I walked out to the reception in a huff.

Incase you don't know, Hospitality is when you have to help out alllll day for the office. So she gave me my badge thingy, so if I'm on the corridors I don't get stopped and such.

So she sat me down on my little desk, and said this is what you had to do. I had to put 8 pieces of paper, folded (worst folder ever, mind) into an envelope.

Six. Hundred. Times. Not amused.

So I did that for most of first period. Sat on my own, at this desk rigggght at the main entrance, so whenever I got warm, somebody would walk in and realease the torrential weather. And I couldn't listen to music either ! PFFT. 

So then I got sent for Tom Murphy, who was in the English I came out of. Mr Burns saidddd ""Moffitt. Pull your tie up, tuck your shirt in, and actually act like you're part of the human race. "" so I blatantly ignored him, and asked for Tom. So he stopped me, and said, Moffitt, turn around, shirt tie. and I simply went ""Caaant ! Jobs to dooo !""

So yes. Then I went back to my desk for some more pick-up-pick-up-fold-fold-put-in-seal job. That continued into break, ughh.

So at break I moaned to everyone. :]

Then I went back to my desk andd got sent around for some jobs. HOW THE HELL do they expect me to know where Mr Greenalgh is on a job?!?1? I still don't know where Room 5 is ffs!! So yes, some of my MADFUN jobs included:
Taking a USB cable to Mr Sherman-Ball.
Asking for about 6797878 pupils.
Chasing Glen, the aurtistic year 7, down the corridor to take him back to class.
Giving people report cards.
Signing people in and out.

So thenn I had to find Sean Redgrave to give him his report card, so I thought PPPERFECT ! time for a mooch. :]

So I went to IT, where my class was, andddd saw PHil. EERR Gareth had pulled like half of Phils eyebrows out. Ewww. So I left there, dismayed of the lack of entertainment. I never found Sean.

Then it was Dinner ! boring. Freda spent half the time in the loooo, I swear she has bladder problems. 

Then last period I had the wicked job of finishing the envelopes off. WOOHOO.
Freda came round though, and we went on a mooch for about 40 minutes aha. I finished at like 2:30, and we finish at 2:40. -.- So I just sat in lesson and watched H feeling Gareth up. SRSLY they looked like gayboys. 

I don't recommend Hospitality.

So we walked home, and I stole Freda's shoe. Yeah I made her hop :D bare in mind the Moss is really muddy ahaha.

Then I came home, had early tea, did some tidying, some homework, showered, played with the cat and listened to ALOT of Comeback Kid, Evergreen Terrace, Shiny Toy Guns and Azriel.

Chow.

<big>Tuesday</big>
German. God that lesson is sooo boring ! 

Scieeence. Tom, Lara, Lucie and Kirsty wanna make a band :| and I was like wtf ? And they would NOT stop going on about it, so I said (meaning nothing) Ok! Aslong as I be drums. And Lazarara said ""no that's me"" So I was like ahhha no. :] But we are going to Mr Flynn (music teacher) on Wednesday, cos we both want to learn drums nonetheless. 

History r poo. 

French on a tuesday is always wickedly cool cos we're in ML3 (modern languages 3) so I'm sat next to H ! Wiiicked. 

Mathhs. Factorising ! Ooh woopee !
<big>Wednesday</big>
Science. Everybody was going cccrazy because they'd found some weird bluetooth thing and I was like ""aaaah shaddap."" 

Music ! wa poo. 

Geography. Yeahyeah Mr Greenhalghg is poo, he made me goo to the toilet and wipe allll my eyeliner off. My eyes were like red and sore :[ but Lara had some so I just re applied >:]

French. On wednesdays we're in ML2 so I'm near Gareth, that = HITTING ON ROBERT. yeahyeah. That yeah yeah also reminds me of the song I've gott rather addicted to, Yeah Yeah - Bodyrox ft. Luciana. RAW DIRTY POP TRACK, PUSH IT IN AND PULL IT BACK ! :D

What on earth did we have last period :| I cannot remember at ALL. 
<big>Thursday</big> 
Science agaaain. 

Drama ! Is always wicked fun. We had to do a mexican wave of emotion, aaaaahaahahah funniest thing ever.

Maths. More factorising. !!!!!!!!!.

English. Ahaha right. Sir moves his hands LOOADS when he talks, and H pointed it out, so thats all we did all lesson was make fun of sir and his uncontrolable hands. It was amazing fun.

Then last lesson it was P.E. OOOmg we had Mrs Lamb [incredibly unqualified substitute teacher) so, we went to the gym and me and Becky went on the rowing machines, and Beckys foot strap wouldn't budge, so I went ""ooo this school is shit !"" and I got sent out of the lesson. :O So me and Shauna were there, and more and more people kept getting sent out. We all hate herr. 
<big>Friday</big>

Englishh. We had some sweaty woman so we didn't do any work. We just sat talking about Year 7 :D

History. LOOOL. We had another substitute teacher, and he didn't know how to use the electric register, so we had to write our names on a piece of paper. Somebody put 'Joanne Card' so I thought 'AHA I'll beat you' and remembered Landys comment and put ""Eileen Dover"" anddd he fell for it. Me and Becky were also big lesbians. 

Then it wassss Maths. Even MORE factorising. !!!!!!1111111. 

Then it was Art. LOOK WHAT I DREW :D

Then it was Dinner. Daniella, Robynn, Amy and Hannah came to sit with us and were reading some of Toms stuff, and we were all talking and Freda went off in a huff cos I wouldn't talk to her. :] So we were walking out, and Miss Kimber took Toms stuff off him and started reading the one entitled 'The Day I Fucked My Mother' Lmaaaao her face was PRICELESS. So we discussed this matter with Daniella and she was like ""Ummm she cannot do that."" And I, aha, went.
""I KNOW I KNOW! Say it's your diary!""  wooork out why that wouldn't work.

We eventually got it back though, after a loong lecture on how it's really inappropriate. OHWELL.

Then it was R.E.

We were in Science and Tom and Lara were all ""Blablablabla"" so I went 'SHUT UP PLEASE.CANNOT HEAR ABOUT ROCK EROSION.' and Tom goes ""NONO we're planning March."" and I was like ^o) it's November turdy. And then Lara goes ""Noo, we're going to see MCR"" and I went :O and told Freda and she was disgusted. Lmao her face. Anyhoo. So Lara rings the MEN and it turns out there ent no tickets. So me and Tom = gutted.

But when I got home I buzzed around on ticketmaster.co.uk and I found a ticket! :OoooOOoOO and it's n the Lower Tier too, and though Standing would be way better, WHO CARES! So I run downstairs like I have dynamite shoved up my hiney, and explain to granneh, and she goes.

""I don't use a credit card anymore, debt doesnt interest me.""

ARGHHH. NOT FAIR AT ALL. I'm seriously considering asking Lara if she'll do it for me and I pay her. and if she can't I ask others. WHO GIVES A SHIT. I reallly wanna go. I cannot believe my nan got shut of her creditcard. :|

ANYWAY, all the malooha over. We got to schooll and turns out Becky has had an asmtha attack :O<3 and she ent innn. So we shivered near the gay graffiti.

Beats rock erosion anyday.

So we went to Becky's, walked to school and everyone was like ""ZOMFGZ NUU SKL LYK DER AZ BIN A FLUD!!!!!111111111111111111"" and turns out there <b>had</b> been a flood, but there still will be school. Ride my penis.

We were in the electrical gymmm. WOWZZZZZ the treadmill is mad fun ahaah. 

Then it was break and I pulled faces at Daniella and Amy through the window. Teeheeee ^.^ and shinyhead was being GAYY and shiny, and said ""tell your emo crew to fuck off"" so I was like. UM GET SOME FACE WIPES INSTEAD OF EATING THAT SAUSAGE. :]

Then it was DT which is always fun because it's Me, Becky, Phil, Jess, Gareth and Rhys. Mad fun. We burnt our hands on glue guns. OWWOwOWowwowo. Hurts bad.

Then it was IT. The worst lesson tbh. But Jess found some postmaster.co.uk site thingy, and sir was being all nice and said we could register if we did it under our school name things. SO YEAH MINT. Me, Jess, Phil, Becky, Rhys, Gareth and Beth were emailing eachotherrr. Aha Gareth was getting annoyed cos we all kept emailing him with ""ORATE GAYBOY ;]"" lmaoao. Fun!

Then it was dinnerrr and I saw Wez ! FINALLY LARK ! I thought he was dead or something lmaoo. and then we went outside into the dramatic weatherrr and Gareth said ""I know something about you"" and eventually he whispered it to me, and I was like WTFNOWAIBULLSHITRIDEMYWIDGY. and he was like 'Yeah, I thought it would be bullshit too, but youknow.' so we shared a hug.

Then it was form.

Then it was Work Relate and I got half an hourrrrrrrrrrrrrr pfft. We were doing Healthy Eating andAHA it was mean. Miss said 

""What's fat?"" and we all shouted ""ROBERT!"" lamaoamaoaoa. Nevermind.

I was talking to my nan about funerals yesterday afternoon. (cheery!.) and we were discussing songs for our funerals, and it's REALLY hard to choose a selected few, y'know. She was saying Phil Collins - Against All Odd for her, and that song is soooo sad. I want a HAPPY funeral. I want everyone to be like ""Staceys dead ! WOOOO!"" please thankyou.

I would also like to request people wearing they're bra's and underpants over their clothes, their clothes being bright and cheery.

Enguuurlish was your average poo lesson, Mr Burns is <b>sooooo</b> lame. We're in a seating plan yeah, and I have Daniel Mitchell on my left, the boy with 10 tonne of earwax, and to my right Beth Lythgoe, who I believe hasn't ever uttered a single word to me. It's GREAT!.

Next was History. No go. Psychotic teacher with very open eyes. So me and Gareth discussed his scars. My GODDD he has alot of scars. Including the one where he punched a glass bottle and it all cut open and you could see his bone. :O

Then it waaaas break. Poo.

Then it was Math. FUCKING HELL, LEVEL <u>10</u> MATH. SRSLY. I'd write out the question, but I don't have a squared sign. ^.^
But I felt like a genious. I'm supper good at it ! (Y).

Then it wasssss art ! Yeahyeahyeah I love art. And we found somebodys school diary, and it had his home phone number in it, so I rang it and shouted ""YOUR SON HAS JUST FARTED"" down it. No I'm not mature.

Then it was dinner. It's so cold, it's scary.

Then it was form.

Then it was R.E. My R.E teacher, Mr Jump, had a bone on YET AGAIN. And then me Freda and Jess, were laughing and I snorted (lovely.) and Freda and Jess found it fucking <u><b>hilarious.</b></u> and then I was complaining about my laugh, and dearest Gareth said my laugh is mint, so yes. :D (Y).

Today = FIT AS FUCK (in the words of Terry) 

So we were in form, and we were informed that the water pipes had burst (again) and that we may be going home. So we were like ""Ohhhk! *spasm*"" 

So we sat in form for two whole smelly hours. Enduring a wonderful chat about emo children, whether I am or not one, and ""OMFGZ 'ER 'AIR IZ RED."" 

Kurt, and a very excited Greg. ^.^

I don't have many freckles. Much. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday007.jpg</url> 
I think Freda looks evil and I look like I'm attemptingppiness. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday008.jpg</url> 
Entertained? Not quite.

If you notice, I pull that mouth expression ALOT.

She burnt my pen on the bunsen burner :'[ 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday016.jpg</url> 

So when we EVENNNNTUALLY got let out, we went to catch the bus to bolton ! Becky wasn't coming, pfft. So we ran for the bus (I imagine this was an hilarious site) and then realised that the 512 took us alllll around Deane, New bury, everything. -.- So we were on a bus, that stank of wee, for a good half hour. A journey that should take 5 mins max. So what did I do? I SANG AMISH PARADISE ! 

Ahaha the old people looked disgusted. :]

Then, when we got there, we restocked in KFC ! Mini fillet, toilet, then off out again. 
Freda leaving the toilet picture? 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday024.jpg</url> 

So we went to New Look, Freda's second home. 

FATTY/SHORTY :D Look at Freda behind me, llolll. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday027.jpg</url> 

Then we tried on shoes ! (I'm in pants, so I don't have to tell you who I am :] oh and btw, I really cannot walk in heels. Think 'blind man on stilts') 

Rip off Vans and Boots. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday028.jpg</url> 
Hm, maybe not. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday030.jpg</url> 
I look slightly drugged. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday032.jpg</url> 
Pink shoes, Red shoes. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday033.jpg</url> 
Shiny shoes, Red shoes. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday034.jpg</url> 
Lacey shoes, REALLY unconfortable shoes. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday035.jpg</url> 
I thought these were <b>sooo</b> cute. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday036.jpg</url> 

Then we left New Look, but just as we did, I met a friend of mine. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday037.jpg</url> 

Lol. :] 

Then we wentttt to Topshop, Freda's third home. 

For me, this will never EVER get old. It's not even that funny, I'm just easily amused. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday038.jpg</url> 

Then, we tried on shoes ! By this time, my feet killed so I stuck to trying on flats. 

Just me on my todd. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday039.jpg</url> 
Red shoes, black comfy shoes.

Then I think we mooooched. Then we went to Bay? I think. Freda's fourth home. 
More shoe trying on !

Glittery shoes, pointy things.

Really uncomfy shoes. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday046.jpg</url>

SCARY. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday051.jpg</url> 
Boots. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday052.jpg</url> 

Then we went to Argos, so Freda could show me her bedroom lamp. So I took this, and I think it's really clever ! cos you can see Freda on the reflection, and my smile actually looks OK here. 
<url>http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g256/holdmy_handx/yayfortheschoolbeingshitday054.jpg</url> 

Then we went back to New Look ! Lol.

""Come down now"" They'll say. 
But everything looks perfect from far away 
""Come down now"" 
But we'll stay.</b></center>

I told numerous friends to kiss my bum and minge, and I told my science teacher to kiss my willy. :]

ANEHWAI. Today was tbh, borinnnn. NO PICTURES :O! but tomorrow I shall whip Leannes arse with videos with sound, and pictures. >:D

So, when we got to school we saw Wezleh, and we were like super early so we talked for abit about his sister, who started this year. NOWAY are they related ahaha. You wouldn't be able to tell, seriously. And Wezleh didn't have a blazer and he'd walked to school :| and it's the sort of put-the-sun-on-the-ground-and-it-will-freeze type weather. :|||

Then we had form, then we had Science. Yeah me and Jessyka and Freda were mucking about. And miss went ""SIIIIIIIILENCE."" and I went ""oh kiss my willy.""

Yeah :]

Then we had Drama but theres a talent show so we had Mrs Lamb who is boring. So we discussed me and my hairrrr. (eee@this pladtic surgery show I've got on right now) So yeah then it was break and at break I smushed Kaishas willy.

Then it wasssss Maths! and omgwozzaz. The coolest maths teacher ever (MC Berty alaahhhasahahaha) said we're the BEST and FUN-NEST express-maths group. SCCORRRREEEEE. Lmao. He said:

""I could do with more groups like you"" and me and my egotistical self replied with:
""Why could you do with more people like me?"" :]

HE HAS THE COOLEST SMILE EVAA. SRSLY. It's like a pervs smile lamaoaoa.

Then it was English. Baaarf. English Sminglish. Tho me and Antony (well, H, but you know) had POO WARS ! lmao funnnnn ! But me, Gareth and Freda had to do lines. 

Then it was Dinner ! But I missed 10 minutes of that, so we just went outside straight away. Shaun was burning his hair and chasing me with a lighter because he is RETARD BOY. Pfffft. Also, I kicked Jordan-Ginger-Pyobs today cos he was trying to annoy us. 

Then it was form and Joe kept singing ""Little Miss Moffitt"" UMYEAHNO. It's sososososoos annoying.

Then it was P.E which was GAY cos it was the last lesson of netball and it was poo cos we had a 2 minute long match. Ooh yes proffessional.

Then I had a detention. Rebel. And Ben and Ryan from the year above are very very funny boys. So yes, we eventually got out at 3:15! Pfft! 5 minutes longer !

So me and Freda walked home and screamed the loudest ever. :D

mmm today was rather ok now I think about it.

Science ! Science test ! I got 7b on my first, and a no grade on the second ahah. (I <b>DIDN'T</b> copy James Tomlinson. Sh. =] ) Also the fish followed my finger cos they are HxC fishehz. Check it. (H)

Breakkk ! Stooood where we always are, took photos, none were good. Wez and Tom are fabbb. So we all hugged alot, because I was cold. so there was Tom hugging me and abby, Wez hugging me and Louise and Kaisha stood there cold. GUTTTED.

History. Our history teacher werrrrnt in so we went to IT ! and I was giving everyone a detailed description on Saw 2 and how you should kidnap me into Saw 3. 

French. Thankyou to Gareth, H and Phil for entertaining me. Gareth with his small ears. Phil with his man voice ahah. (it's very low.) and H with his all round mintness. He was sat next to me, and we were pinging eachother and writing poo alot on a piece of paper, and also for saying this.

""Gareth!""
""What?""
""Turn around.. Pull your pants down.. bend over so I can stick my widgy up your bumhole."" ahaha I love that boy. 

Dinner ! We have this plasma TV now in the crush hall, and MCR were on so me and Abby were singing. :D Yeah so we went in, and I spotted Connor Platt. and I was messing with his weird hair. It's like a hedgehog thing, with a long bit at the back, and those tramline things where you look like a train has ran through your hair. Ahahahah it's amazing. I was like ""WOAAAA.""

So we went outside and whoreddddd ! I appreciate the fact that I look gay, fat, spotty and with curly hair on thse following pictures.

So we were like okk nice one. And my nan was like pfft ok. So Abby could come if she got a lift home, but she couldn't so we were like, lets go in 20 minutes. And we were like mmm daylight. We can get the bus (which is what I was gonna do anyway but abby wasn't allowed cos it would be dark) so we were like OK! ALRIGHT! and my nan goes ""Um no you're not going."" and I was like.

EEEEE FUCK OFF. And she says ""Because I don't wish for you to go."" Umno, I dont care. So then Abby was like ok, you and tom come to mine, and I was like ehok. And now I'm not allowed OUT at all.

Becky cancelled which has HIGHLY pissed me off. It's one of THEE most annoying things ever, when people cancel. It's like ""Why? Am I not good enough for you?!"" 

Although, two good things. Yeah Tom kept me entertained for like an hour and a half, he was in his box and he was falling all over the place, saying ""SHIT"" alot, and raping his hamster*. Hilarious, believe me. 

And when my Nan went to ASDA, she ran into Beckys mum, and they were taking and such, and Jill (beckys mum) was saying how much she hates Freda and her mum and how she much prefers me as Beckys best friend. Ahaha SCOREEEE. Freda's mum is really scary, and if you've ever watched that scary tap dancer video, her mum resembles that. Scary shit. She feeds freda Cucumber soup that looks like it's been down twice. Gutted.

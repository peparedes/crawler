I simply cannot bear it. Three-odd hours in a theatre and not enjoying one little bit of it. Give me Rocky Horror or Return to the Forbidden Planet any day of the week. But no. It just HAS to be Chicago. 

She eats it up. Hell, she'd have it instead of ketchup with her chips given a chance. And it's times like this that I realise just how much she means to me. I am going to endure hell tomorrow night but as long as she smiles at the end of it I will think it a brilliant evening. That's what love is.

"event","Why is it always the lowest common denominator that seek me out as the one face out of six that who they must talk to/shout at? Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to talk, I enjoy it especially if it's a subject I'm interested in. As a computer game store attracts geeks of all kinds I often find myself embroiled in a discussion about the X-Men, or Star Wars or the X-Box.

It's the mindless saps that seem to think that because their mate said something down the pub, it must be gospel. It's these same peasants which are under the impression that by shouting louder and swearing at me it will somehow magically make their claims become true. When coupled with a laughable grasp of grammar in the first place it's enough to make me want to ram a DVD down their throat.

""I assure you sir, that the Slimline PS2 is not the PS3.""
""No, you're wrong. It is the fuckin' PS3 innit?""

Then a friend/child/wife pipes up with the ever-so helpful:

""Nah, the PS3 is that portable thing.""
""Madam, that's the PSP. An entirely different beast.""
""Ain't you got one?""
""It hasn't been released over here yet""
""Why not?""
""Because Sony haven't got it ready for a European Market.""
""That's fuckin' shit, that is.""

Finally the conversation got around to why they were in the shop in the first place.

""I wanna new PS2""
""I'm afraid we are out of stock Madam.""
""Why?""
""Because the demand has been too great for us to match.""
""Can't you look in the stock-room for one?""

Yes, I'll just nip back there and whip my elf army into shape. They'll have one made for you in no time at all. Hell, it'll be fresh out of the oven, you'll be able to smell the moulded plastic!

I don't ask for much, just a conversation that has a few pleases, maybe a thank you. A conversation that doesn't involve swearing in a shop full of kids. Most of the time I get them and it's always the one bad customer that sticks in your mind. Today was no exception. I get one rude family and it sets me off badly for the rest of my shift.

Pfft."

Libraries are depressing places. Here I am, sitting in the University of Reading's library and everyone is miserable. It's a centre for academic excellence and nobody is happy. I look around and there is not a single happy face. Even when a friend turns up the smiles of greeting are subdued because both parties know that they are not here for fun. They are here to learn and it sucks the happiness right out. This is why I could never be an academic.

Can you imagine devoting your life to study? Add to that the job requirement of having to tell ungrateful teenage students about all this wonderful stuff you've learned only for them to bugger off with their degree and do nothing related to the subject for a career? The pay is crap too.

It must take a really special person to do that. I'm not special. I'm materialistic. I want money and I want job satisfaction. And after these five years of training are over I should have it. Or so I hope.

Until then I have to sit among all these happy people and research depreciation rates and refurbishment costs of offices in the UK.

It strips the happiness away..."

I have ten more weeks of education left before I have to take exams, the dreaded finals. If everything goes to plan, I'll get my degree and be able to start at DTZ in September. It's quite mind boggling to think that after so many false dawns my life might actually be heading somewhere. 

As long as I can buckle down and do the work.

It's always been my problem, I'm too sodding arrogant. Once I understand something, I understand it in my own way. I don't need to keep having it rammed down my throat to make it stick. It's already bloody stuck. Problem is, once I get it, I'm hard to persuade there's other ways of looking at it. That, and I've always been too lazy to do the written work. Read my school reports from when I was 10! I just am not the academic sort. My brain works fine, it understands concepts and ideas, remembering info is no trouble either. It just has a habit of moaning at me when I try to make it write the stuff down.

Doesn't seem to mind when I have to write a post though. Odd things, chemicals.

Back to the grindstone it is then. I've got to get some more work done before Dave comes round to pick up my cymbals. God I miss my drums. I have to make do with tapping my knees or any other surface that is nearby. Drives Rach mad.

Just wait till I can afford a new set. Oooh Baby!"

I've been introduced to this thing by someone who has rapidly become a very good friend and I trust her judgement that this might enhance my soul or somesuch.

I look at the options below and there's a thing that says 'music' And then it is blank. Presumably I just enter an address of an mp3 and whoever reads this gets to listen to whatever ditty crosses my mind. That of course might be too complex. Gah. Sometimes technology just violates me.

Something more than I can be...


I love possessions, but I love God more.
I love friends, but I love God more.
I love my church, but I love God more.
I love my family, but I love God more.
Someday I will have a wife, but I will love God more.
Someday I will have children, but I will love God more.
Someday I will be a man who will love God more.

I am trying to be a man. I am trying to love my friends and my family and my God. I try, but I cannot. By myself, I cannot. I have failed before I started to try. I have failed before my first thought. And yet, I have also succeeded, in Christ. I have loved when Christ loved. And I died on the cross through Him. I pray you will turn me from my wicked ways, dear God. I pray for forgiveness and for redemption, for wisdom and for patience, for grace and for mercy. Give me the strength I am without, give me the strength to love. Amen.

I am trying so hard, everyone...please, pray for me. And be patient with me, when I cannot with you.

~Aaron

P.S. I miss my brother..."

Yea...Looking back on it, I think I missed the intended purpose. But enjoyed it and nobody was hurt...I hope. So, I'm happy about it. But I'm sad in another fasion. I would just like you all to pray for my friend, Terry. Even though you probably dont know him, just please pray for him. He's having a really hard time right now. Well, I love you all and hope you are doing well. And if not, talk to me. I'm ALWAYS here for you. Or just call me cause you feel like it. That's cool too. Much love from my end.

"event","I think so many people are far too reliant on material things to bring them moments of joy, rather than being happy just sitting and talking or just sitting and thinking, for that matter. I'm not excluding myself, by any means. I just think that I'm sick of people complaining about things that either don't really matter or aren't going to matter in about a day. 

I'm really having trouble finding the point in talking about things with...no point. Like saying something that is just so matter of fact and blatantly obvious that the only thing the person you're talking to can say is, ""Uh...yea."" Now, there is room for that within the awesome rockin' bounds of joking, but when used outside those confines it seems rather...painfully hollow.
*At this point I'm just working things out in my brain, thanks for bearing with me, if you are*
Anyway, I guess I'm just having a hard time...socially, right now. I don't know if I'm growing disgustingly selfish or if it just seems more of a factor right now so it's a part of me that just hasn't really come out yet. So, if I'm being stupid and self-centered I need to change. If this is just a part of me, I need to work through it some how. If this is both, then I need to go soak my fat head.

P.S. that isn't really a P.S. I would just like to say I'm sorry to everyone for not really talking much via the internet, or via all the options...I've just been trying to get some alone time and some peace and quiet...I hope you can understand and forgive me.

With love that is a gift of God and no doing of my own,
Aaron

There is no point in denying truths, but if they are sick, perverted truths then we must try our best to change them, opposed to ignoring them. If we are in trouble with our own sin and we feel like we can't make it of our own volition, then we absolutely MUST have good friends and family who are willing to listen to our cause and try and help keep us accountable with and from ourself. It seems to me that so many people have ""friends"" that are just in it for themselves. To get what they can out of the relationship while giving back as little as they possibly can, and they can never understand why you would go too far out of your way to do something special for a friend. I think those people need good friends who love them more than they may even know.

I did not really have any particular point, but those things just kinda popped into mind. I really hope that everyone is meeting good days, but I know bad ones come along, so I just want you ALL to know that I'm here for you any time, anywhere. Much love from my end and God bless!

You're covering up. You're withholding all your festering smut. You've played the part you're playing now for so long it's no longer authentic. You've become a heretic and a closet skeptic but you've managed to keep yourself just as pathetic. You've lost your tact in the fires of lust and you've lost your heart to so many you don't love.

My mind could handle the flesh

I collapsed at your sight
From then on out
Intoxication seeping through
Every conceivable route

Failure leaking out all my pores
Splashing down in such an accord
Pooling up I sway back and forth
In this torrent of love my strength was a torch

I wasn't weak at the knees
I wasn't dumb struck
I played it real cool
I just completely forgot where I was

And my mind didn't exist
Me eyes watered up
Ears could not unfocus
And I felt my heart erupt

In the midst of my bliss
A distant echoing shout
You leaned in for his kiss
And then my flame died out

"event","First I will tell you about my night last night:

I went for a walk. I knew where I was going only as far as I could see. The streets were welcoming in their empty stability. They don't exist because of the cars, but, rather, for the cars. I found my way through the rows of houses, which were, unusually (but not surprisingly) uninviting, while thinking of my place and purpose in this world, while coming to no particular conclusions but rather working through what I knew of my current position for the supposed outcome of an conclusion. I made my way towards a corner of houses, with a turn to my right as my only apparent path, I notice a swing set in the distance. I love swings. I see a path inbetween two houses and it leads to a school and its playground. I sit on the swing as a light rain taps on my hat. I think about what I want out of life. I want to feel important. I want to feel needed. I want to feel loved. I want to feel more than I do. I think to myself about my talents in drawing, "" why should I not pursue this career? If I have an innate skill in it why would I not want to do it?"" I think of how, in my mind, the thought of this career actually causes me grief and frustration. This is not what I want. I want something more. I would very much enjoy screaming for a band. It is so heartfelt and emotional. Yet still very touching to a listener. This, this purpose and feeling, is what I want. I pray to God for strength and wisdom. I sit and decide that I need to take more action than what I have been. Then I think about how there will, someday, be kids playing and having fun on this very playground. It makes me very happy. Then I started to hear faint music past the houses I was by. So, naturally, I followed. I narrowed the source of music down to three houses, and left it open ended. The light above me was flickering its yellow glow across the pavement, an obvious sign to search my pockets. In my coat pocket I feel something, bumpy at one end, but thin and straight for the rest of the object. Naturally, I reach in my pocket. I pull out a Spiderman PEZ dispenser and, naturally, pull back the head to discover lemon flavored PEZ. I ate it and it was amazing, artificially. I headed home the way I came, whilst eating PEZ and singing Eisley. As many of you know I am not a girl, making Eisley not the choice thing for me to sing. But this was not my concern, because I just didn't care if people realized I can't sing like a girl. I walked between the yellow stripes making their appearance down the middle of the street while dodging and hurdling over earth worms. As I left the road and sidewalks I bid them all safe journeys and made my way back into my basement window. As always, I knocked down the curtains.

Sorry this is long, almost done.

Today: Basically Sam and I: Woke up in the same room, played the same video game on two different TVs, went to the library, screamed like women at cars, sang along with The Faint, saw a park, went to Wal-Mart to get things for my mom, played the same game on two different computers, went to see Sin City, loved it (except for the naked people, you sicko), then produced a wonderful fountain of pop with my mouth (which we just mopped up).

I'm not complaining, just putting thoughts on as they come to me. Take it how you want. God bless....yes, there's a God. One. Don't search your heart to see the answers, because our hearts lie, our hearts taint and spread their own disease...like peanut butter. Much love from my end. *big hug*"

Saw my new house after church (which was absolutely wonderful), the house was really REALLY nice. The basement isn't finished yet, but it'll get there. I love my family. My grandparents and my aunt and my mom and my brothers and I all went to Culver's after that. They are all always so encouraging to me. Gosh, they just make me want to cry.

Came home, went to amez to buy gloves, nobody has the kind I want, Kyle bought some Magic cards, I bought some tampons, go figure. I'm not sure who got the better end of the deal.

Came home, again. Watched me bredren. Put them to bed. Then did crap on the internet. Parents went to see a movie. I watched the movie We Were Soldiers...cried...shut up. Oh, if only I could get shot. Or hit by a car. Hmm. You never know. Here's hopin'!

"event","The past few days stuff has happened...true story.

I went to the library one day, I'm not sure which, but I went there to pick up some books for my mum. So while I was sitting there, by the shelves, looking through these books this older guy starts walking towards me. He says, ""How are you?""...I had no idea who he was, but I wanted to be polite. ""Uhm, I'm doing good. How are you?""
""Good.""...pause...
I said, ""Do I know you?""
He says, ""Do you play chess?""
""Not that much.""
""Because there is a chess tournament in Chicago. We could go.""
uhm...yea, so, ""Oh, I don't think I'd be much of a challenge for anybody there.""
""Well, I could teach you"".""
""Thanks, but I've never been much for chess.""
""Do you play backgammon?""
and it went on...eventually he gave me his phone number and wants to meet me at the Heartland for some racquetball. Ek. I thought it was hilarious. Ek.

Lots of fun at school...slight sarcasm. There was some awesome fun times with Annewise and Will. Thanks buddies.

I need people to pray for a friend of mine. It's Amanda Messerly. Two nights ago her house burned down. It destroyed everything but some of the kitchen. And their dog didn't make it out. They are staying in a hotel right now. If you would just keep them in your prayers, please.

As always, awesome sweet fun with Slammo and Tyler. ""Humiliation galore."" We watched Dark City (which that quote is not from, that quote is from my favorite movie), it was totally great. It had some pretty wonderful magic.

I can't tell who to trust anymore...does that make you lose trust in me? I find it funny how we base our lives in lies. I've lied. You've lied. I think it's funny how we are supposed to be maturing. Yea, right. Let's make gross jokes and say it's ""adult"". Wahoo.

"event","Sam and I tried to jam last night, we got some things done, but Jonathan and Tyler both stopped in my room during the little time we had to jam anyway. It was a little frustrating, but it's okay. That was fine, we will have tons of times to jam, but the worst part was when sam left...because then, for some reason, Tyler and Jonathan just completely changed. They started making these sick jokes and cussed craploads. And Kyle wasn't helping the situation. They asked him to play, ""Now You're A Man"" By the guys from South Park. That was fine. So I had Kyle throw on some Scooter, but once again they wanted something else, like ""Asshole"" By Denis Leary. As you can probably already tell, it's a funny song, but it's vulgar enough. I was getting very put off at this point because they were still just cursing and being really lame. But then Kyle put on ""Beastman vs. Skeletor"" and I just left the room. The whole thing was just really depressing, because I had thought better of those three. Especially Kyle and Tyler. But apparently it's too much work to think of clean fun things to do. I'm getting really tired of this. It doesn't really sound like maturity to me, but what would I know, right?

I go through so many depressing emotions during the day I just end up feeling so drained and lame each night. Not that my nights are much better.

       This is my request: I want to have a good, deep, heart-felt conversation with someone. Anyone. About how you really feel. About what is really having an affect on your life. What you believe. What you want out of life.

   I feel so wasted on mindless bickering. I feel so sheltered by a constant sap of my happiness. I want to make people happy, but it never seems to work. I want to make people see the need for realizing what's important and taking the small issues less...seriously. I think I'm gonna make another post after this and just ramble about nonsense. Because I haven't in a long time.

And now I almost want to forget the good ones. And now I want to be alone...but then I would be without you. But why would you care? Why would you ever care? When did you ever care? Was it the time you held me? Did you then? Or did it just feel good to do it, and that's the reason why? Why is everyone here afraid to speak their mind? Oh it's offensive, keep it inside, that way no one gets hurt!!! No, that way no one can learn. That way we are all okay. That way we don't know that we're sinners. That we're selfish, dirty, worthless, helpless, hopeless, lifeless, spineless, dying, uncaring, faithless hypocrites. Wait though, the thing you don't don't want us to say, the thing that might drive people away, GOD. It is through His grace and mercy we are saved...because we are in dire need of being saved. Why can't I tell you how I feel? Why can't I tell you how much I love you? Hate you? How much I could hold you? Kiss you? Every time I said I would say it you said that you found someone new. Every time I thought you might want me, that maybe I actually did do one thing right for us. Maybe this could work out, maybe you love ME now. Those thoughts were torn apart by the next day we met. Every time I've gone up I've gone down ten times farther. Every time I look up the noose just got longer. I'm just waiting for it to stop growing, stop letting me slide, just stop...watch me die.

I love you mom, dad, kyle, janet, sam, stacey, andrew, hannah, tyler, john, josh, james, anne, and becca...there are so many more...so many that I'm sorry I ever ignored...I hope that I can have forgiveness...I'm not a worthless soul...I will be meaningful...I will tell the truth"

"event","My friends in Michigan are amazing. They made me look emo/scene. Some people say that they like it. Oh goodness. I love them SO much!

TODAY!!!*explosion*

So I didn't go to bed until somewhere between 4-6 a.m. ""last night"" woke up somewhere around 10:30 to watch the kidz. They are black. And cute. And smart. I love them so much! After that I went back to bed until about 1:30. I don't really remember what I did, but eventually I gave Stacey a call and we hung out to the extreme. Went to Wal-Mart and got me some eyeliner and a sweet Christmas present belt...thanks Stacey!! It's PINK! (p.s. talk to me before you do your hair Stacey, I talked with Andrew). Came back home around 8, went and got McD's with Slammo then came back and did some major hanging out. I'm actually starting to realize that I'll never be the perfect person no matter how hard I try, so I should just accept me as I am. I should still try and be the best person I can, but don't go overboard with it.

Amazingly wonderful times with Stacey. Thanks lady. You look good too."

"event","NOTHING! YESsssss....Which is actually toastally(kyle) awesome, because I didn't need a thing. I had a wonderful Christmas...wow. I would like to apologize to James about not having the movie. Sorry about that! So, I woke up anywhere from 10:30 to 11 a.m., don't really remember. Ate a totally sweet breakfast made by the parents, then I took a rocking shower, played some friggin' tight video games, probably ate, went to IncrediStacey's, Tyler called and wished us a happy Christmas (which it was!), I called Slammo...hope his rocked, went to see the movie Darkness with Josh Ladd...it pretty much sucked...but it was a ton load of amazing fun, now I'm home, sipping on my tea, eating my scones, watching the derby on telly, bagpipe at the ready, dog on my lap, rolling the lint of my favorite skirt, hanging my one-piece swimsuit to dry, pacemaker running well, so is the hamster, and SCENE! 

OH WAIT! I did get a present!!! From Kyle! It's the School Of Rock soundtrack! For YAY! 

I like to write about hate!

Going to Michigan!!!! To see Andrew and Hannah! They are apparantly going to turn me into a scene kid. I'm a little nervous. I don't know what I'm gonna look like when I get back...but I guess it can't get any worse, huh?

Okaybye"

"event","IT SNOWED!!!!!! ARRRR!!!! I went out and played with my little brothers in the snow! Oh it was fun! I love playing in the snow with kids...good times. OH! Linda gave me a Christmas present today too! Thanks Linda!!! Let's see...I called my brother gay a bunch, had fun with Tyler...Need to do homework...little motivation...Can't wait until break starts...Napoleon Dynamite comes out Tuesday...go me. whatever.

I was thinking today, after going outside with AJ and CJ, I want to give everything I can to my kids. I want them to be happy. I want to be able to spend quality time with them. To teach them what stuff is and show them how to have fun...like my dad. He is a wonderful father. I could only hope to be half the dad he was to me.

Much love"

""I remember my wife...""
""That's sweet.""
""...dying. I remember my wife dying""

UHG! That is an amazing movie! And if you can name it, I'll give you a nugget of solid wisdom, straight from my brain. And a hug. If you want. gosh. Just say the codeword: ""Toastally Axellent Shmitre"" if you don't want a hug. Say, ""All you ever say is crap anyway"" if you don't want my nugget. Say, ""All you ever wear is that Toastally Crapulent Shmitre anyway"" if you want neither. Good movie.

Played Halo Deux at Austin Bunning's(sp?) Grandma's house. I find that insults like, ""You freaking hole mother snipe lunch crack mother!"" Don't have the same affect expected from most insults. I guess it's just not my thing. But it's fun!

I've been sleeping with Kyle...and it's so addicting, I'm gonna do it again tonight. 

LOVE"

"event","Today was amazing. After Stacey told me I'm fake, I started thinking...I thought I have been living as myself. I thought that I had been myself and making people happy was something that I NEEDED to do to be happy with myself. But, as usual, Stacey was right. I can't JUST think about helping people, it's not good for me. I should try and help if I can, but sometimes I just can't. And it's okay. It's gonna take a little getting used to, not trying to do everything for everybody, but I get the feeling it shouldn't be too hard to adjust. I already feel like a huge weight has come off of me. Let me tell you some of the things I've forgotten how much I enjoyed:

Chasing my little brothers around the house like a monster...because they are into Monsters Inc. now, so cute!

Having fun just hanging out with friends and making jokes that have no basis in reality...STICK 'EM UP! The Wickstick. Shmitre (Sombrero+ Shinto hat+ Mitre). oh...good friends

Seeing a good movie with an even greater person

Stretching in the morning and smiling

Wearing whatever the heck I want

Wondering why people feel awkward sitting at the table in the middle of Subway

The smell of my mom's Christmas cookies

Me, Josh, innuendos

People not hearing me when I say their name...or just in general, because I'm quiet

The Princess Bride, While You Were Sleeping...I'ma sap

Not being gay but acting like it! Fun times. Gay stormtroopers!!! HAR HA HAR GAAR!!!

Screaming in the van because I got nowhere else to...

And all the people who set me straight...

Much love from my end"

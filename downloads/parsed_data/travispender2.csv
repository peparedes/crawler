Oh & I have four classes with Sara :/ 

[[well who cares about this. idc if shes unhappy with me being in 4 of her fucking classes. if she doesnt like it, her fatass can change her schedule]]

 


<b>&& more

Ahahahahaha I love you you're hilarious

We're effing gorgeous & Travis is jealous of our hot bods

Rofl

This is so fun
it's scary

Sara is very pretty & her boyfriend is rather sexy but she's not that great okay?
&& Jackie is just...
Blah no one likes her.

She just follows Sara around like a little puppy waiting for a treat

I love that no one can see these
I feel so secretive lmao

TALKING CRAP TOGETHER = MOST FUN THING EVERRRR

Hahahaha 

</b>
[[mkay. dont talk shit about jackie like that and expect to get away with it bitch]]

&& more

Lmao I love this 
It's like my new favorite hobbie :]

We are bitchfacesa & we are proud

&& We post really long comments that no one else can see hahahahaha

No one would add an ugly whore
It just doesn't work that way
<b>Travis = dramaQUEEN</b>

Sara & Jackie
vmopsija08vutg80unitherohgredafedsai5g9-374
GO HOME!
& Stop acting like you're God's gifts to Earth
You suck!

Lmao I think I'm gonna take her off
<b>
Yeah Travis is a little bit on my I don't like you list

He can get over it
OMG too many cool kids posting bulletins twice a day!
WTF?!?!?!
Two times?!?!

Rofl

OH no they don't want ugly people riding a train that's going to be shown to jillions of people??
Why???

lmao
</b>
I know Mitchell told me
I hope she doesn't talk crap about us in front of Lucas

I love talking crap about people with you too

I <3 you bitchface

Oh no Sara would never call her BFFTDWDAUFG9UG9WAG7U9FHDSUIGA
a bitchface! 


[[if they're talking about what i think theyre talking about...

YES I DO TALK SHIT ABOUT YOU INFRONT OF LUCAS AND HE FUCKING HATES BOTH OF YOUR GUYS'S GUTS. KAILEE LEAVE HIM THE FUCK ALONE HES NOT INTERESTED IN YOUUUU.]]

<b>
[[ps- i wouldnt call jackie a bitchface cause im not retarded.
and stop calling travis ugly. does it make yourself feel better talking all this shit??]]
</b>

&& more

 


Well I asked him what time on Thursday & he said he didn't know so I didn't tell him I was or wasn't going yet

I think he's just leajous cause we got in the Murder Scene & he wants to be in it but he thinks he's too good for it

Whatever dude Jackie has been a bitch extreme & if expressing our feelings about her is mean then oh well we're bitches too

I think I should take her off
Sara would never do that though :]

<333 

<b>
[[travis is too good for anything with you in it. :]. 
</b>
stop talking about me and bringing me into this shit assholes.]]

&& more

Rofl I know
I'm contemplating taking her off all together...
<b>
P.S. Travis thinks my hate group is mean :] 
</b>
...making a hate group of jackie is just retarded. wtf. its not like she did anything wrong. except say you guys are fake. and you are. get used to it.

Gahhhhh I hate thisssssss 


iluhhmyjackie.

 

haha. kailee and lauren messed with the wrong people. what idiots.



--------

Lauren's Message:

What you did was ignorant and mean and instead of going behind our backs and telling everyone what you think, maybe you should try talking to us first, so you don't look like such a brat. I thought you got over it but apparently when you say you forgive someone you actually mean that you plan on being a sneaky asshole. 
Thanks for ruining our friendship Travis. That was very mature of you."

Woke up around 12ish today. Helped my sister with some Things, got ready.
Ang, Gina and Brit stopped by - <b>i miss brittany so much =\</b>
talked to them for a few, they left; left with my father to go to the hospital. it may sound funny, but i had so much fun with him today. Things seem like there back to normal.
Now im just hoping/praying that my mother will get better faster, & go in the nursing home this week sometime :] than she can be on her way hommeeeee. As much as i dont show it, its so different with her not being here. i hate it sometimes.

On the way home from the Hospital my dad had to stop by the Rafalskis.
Boy oh boy i miss it there but what can i do. Talked to Lindsay for a few, cought up on things - I love her, Seen matthew, nothing has changed with him.
Finally grew some balls & talked to ashley about how i felt, I think she actually understood. I miss her so Much =\  Hope things will change. Mrs. Lori just made me wanna cry I cant stand not talking to her. 

I looked back on pictures of me & Stefanie, when we started hangin out during Spring Break, after that we never stopped hangin out. I seriously miss you so much- We both have cheerleadin & basketball, but i still hope we stay close and honest to each other. 

-- Im hoping to get Uppnortthhh soon, I cant wait.. <33

I think lately i've been understanding my Sister more. like yeah we have our fights and all that, but i really understand her lately and i think she is one of the stronngest in the family. <33

Im sitting here talking to Brittany about all My problems. I cant describe how much she makes things better. I think shes the only one that understands me. Sometimes i feel that things are gonna be back together sooner <33 Brittanyyy I love youu Thanks for everything.

i feel like im connecting with my mother so good lately, 
i just wanna go to the hospital right now, I think imma spend the night with her one night soon <33

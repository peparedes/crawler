"event","Damn. ^ That's really how I feel. How I always feel after breaking up with a guy (a guy I  didn't like at least). Why is it that I have a delay on realizing how stupid people are? I have a week crush period where I don't notice. Then I wait 2 weeks trying to understand why I always end up dumping rather then being broken up with... I'm too damn picky. My big problem. But without naming any names... he is BY FAR the biggest dumbass I have met in a very very long time... so sad so sad. He and I were friends for a long time too... haha yea that's completely over. WELL I can at least say I got something positive out of that short waist of time... Kim is awesome. I'm so glad her and I have become friends. Poor girl def suffered longer then I did... I am ashamed that I BELIEVED him when he said so many horrible things about her... if I hadn't decided to keep talkin to her ""just to be nice"" I would never have known what a lier he was. She's great. I'm really glad we are friends... hahha all burping aside. You know... for knowing myself so well... or at least thinking I do... I sometimes come up with some shocks... I PRETEND. Well not completely. I pretend feelings in a relationship... like I'm giving a show... and I'm ashamed of that. I'm so horribly one of those people who speaks her mind and doesnt give a shit what other ppl think... but htne I give guys false impressions... to be completely truthful i've actually had whole hearted feelings for waht? 2 guys in my entire life? And every guy i've even flirted with probably thinks i was crazy for them. This is something to work ok. Somehting big to work on. But you know honestly - I have gotten to the point in my life where I am anti-guys. I done. Myabe it's just that I know too much of waht I want. I can't justp lay... and i certainly don't want to pretend anymore. Plus I'm happier single. Jealous boys suck. 
      So I'm worried about my brother... um again... when does it stop really? He has changed. He is not the same person he use to be. I use to love how close we were... and now suddenly he doesnt talk to me. Not like he sees me - he is never home. Haha he and all his friends have decided to become red heads. Oh well. 
     So get this... I filled out the fafsa stuff and they are saying my parents should pay practically ALL of my tuition to Stetson. Damn. Looks like Ali's not gonna be getting a lot of spending money from daddy next semester... it's all gonna be going to paying for college! Thank god my gpa is high... Straight A's with my all duel enrolled schedule doesnt hurt either... That's around a 4.6 for this semester... I'm curous what my gpa will be at graduation... but i've already gotten one KILLER scholarship from stetson and there are more on the way... plus i have the joy of meeting all those alumni tuesday... 
     Oh god I am SO excited for classes to start!!! The 15th seems so long from now... everybody is starting already. I know Ry starts Tuesday. My classes this semester kick ass. Well a few do. College algebra and Comp 2 honors aren't all that exciting... but the others are making me long for them to start. I'm bored I guess. I've been reading like crazy all break, or as much as I could, and I'm ready for some descusions and lectures. I am a nerd. I hated high school... I hate phcc too... it is shitty, but it is at least better then WC. I can learn there. Yea, it's the kind of place where you pass easily enough but really, the prof's care, and you do have a great opportunity to learn if you really want to. I can't wait to get to Stetson... I really do eat up all the stuff Kev tells me about waht's he is learning. It's awesome to still be best friends with him. He is interested in the same stuff i amm... i love that... and he doesnt mind just teaching me what he learned in class... haha he gets into it knowing how excited I am over it. Ok, i'm a nerd. Who knew i'd end up feeling like this? But hey, it's lasted a semester now... this huge excitemtn for learnin' ... and everybody knows how enthusiastic i've always been about college...
     Anyways, I'm gonna jump into Hanity's Let Freedom Ring and relax in a little bubble bath... everyone at my highschool and all my usf buddies, good luck w/ ur new classes... have fun.

Ry is awesome as shit, but as the trip[ continued my brother seemed to get more and more immature. I will miss boston though, Derek told me its his fav city and I have to whole heartedly agree. Its stunning. I would love to live there, eventually. As for right now, Its around 12 and with me waking up at 515 this morning, I'm sleepy. I'm sitting on the comp waiting for Ashleigh to get off the phone, but the mac and chz is ready, so i gotta jet and chow down guys.

After Ashleigh, Nikole is my best friend... but she pisses me off lately, and it seems like instead of just talking to her about wahts wrong, I almost just want to drop her and not care.  But then again, if I ever have a problem w/ kev or Ash, I will talk ot them about it asap.  Not that i have too many probs w/ Ashleigh... and None w/ kevin lately... But still ---- I was whinning to kev about how I was feeling screwed over by Nik... and he kept telling me to just talk to her about it... and I pretty much didnt want to.  He repeated over and over that she is one of my best freinds, and a very important person to me, and that our friendship is worth saving and all that... and anyways... I hung out w/ her tonight.  I really didnt want to at first, but did.  After we started hanging out it was better. We saw Mr. Deeds... afterwards we hung out w/ some guys.... when we were driving back to her place we began talking though... and then just sat there in the car for quite a while and talked.  We then went to super walmart to buy some candles... lol... but eventually I actually got everything I was upset about out in the open.  Its soooo much better now. I'm so glad we talked.  I think most of my probs w/ her are over... 
  I feel bad sometimes... Nikole has had such a tough life... I just wnat to give her waht she's not had.  LOL I feel like a mother, or girlfriend, or something.  She is so strong, there are so many things I admire about her.  But htne again, she is so insecure about stuff, and worries so much. 
  I'm going to the beach in the morning.  My lazy ass hasnt rolled out of bed before 1 in about 2 weeks... but tomorrow Ahs said she'd be at my house around 10.  Haha... I want to go work out before that.  I will have to get up around 830. Its after 330 now. Wonder if it will happen. So I'm gonna get to bed now so i can try.  Good luck to me! Night guys! MWAH..."

I was sooo depressed all day.  So thank god I have Nik to get my mind on to more interesting things... like hot frat guys... hehe.
We just went over to Jason and Daves tonight... their other roomate, Neil, just had $600 laying around and decided to buy a kegerator (sp?) with it... so they have draft beer just sitting next to the couch.  Haha, seriously - its all those boys have been talking about for the last 4 days.  So Nik and I go over there expecting greatness.... it wasnt too impressive, but hey, draft bud light is not bad... we're thinking next time they fill up we will demand amber bock...
We didn't do much, just chilled, played cards and drank.  But I had fun, and my night didnt involve too much crying... I was sitting in a bubble bath until around 10 when Nikole called and made me come out ... I'm very glad I did.  
I miss Ash! Need to see her soon!!!!!!! 
Tomorrow is my last (hopefully last) aptmt w/ my surgen... all my swelling has not gone away though, so mabye not. Anyways, I got the office a card, and maybe some desserts or something?

He's a great catch and def better then most of the guys around.  I love ticha and I know she is trying to do teh right thing.  I know she doesnt wantt o hurt him.  Hopefully they can remain friends and all that.

I swear hott guy Darin grabs my ass more then any other guy in my life!! LOL, I try like hitting him and telling him to stop... i dunno, he does shit like that all the time, grab my hand, brush against me, always always has his arms around me... i mean its just weird.  In a way its tough to not think about how he's just playing and absolutely sooooo hot! ugh i am annoyed.  so he wants to go out.... he keeps telling me to ""hurry up and turn 18"" god damn ... the man is 27.  WAY too old.  

Matt bought his motorcycle.  NO WAY IN HELL i will ride on that thing.  It can be his toy all he wants but he's not driving me on it.  never. he was estatic tho.  Completely eating up all the complements on the thing.  haha he came into my work twice today... lol he comes in to see me and then ends up talkin to the guys about bikes... how sweet hunnie.  ;) its ok, such a boring topic.  

Ash and I had dinner tonighnt it was GREAT. I missed her like hell!!!!!! 

Wow, dane, we never talk anymore.  You were like my best friend, and ONLY guy friend.  I miss ya.  Its kinda depressing.... oh well.............................................

I've been sick and throwing up for the last 2 days... life is hell irhgt now.  The only good part about being home so much is taht I'm catching up on work.  Right now, its like 1030 and I'm feeling pretty damn shitty.  Who knows if I'll be there tomorrow. I forced myself to go to pre calc and then I worked today.  I dunno ... maybe I'll be ok, I hope so.  I like feel better, then go out (to work) and get home feeling like shit.  

Oh, I watched felicity tonight, that show is pretty damn good.  Its over soon tho I think, she's graduating.  I should have watched it from the beginning.

"event","Yea so a buddy from work is leaving at 4 am tomrrow to fly to South Africa, where he is from.  It sucks cuz it feels like he and I have just become friends this weekend, and now he's gonna be gone for 2 months... I'm gonna miss him.  

So we were all gonna go out and say goodbye, but I think that has been canceled, its pretty late already, and he just called and said he still has stuff to pack and has to wake up at 330.  Poor guy.  SO we just said goodbye over the phone... I'll see him June 1st.  

I talked to Derek tonight.. Leigh told me that he heard I was going otu w/ Matt and didnt know if we should still go ot prom togetehr... So I got all worried that he was gonna cancel w/ me or something, and called him.  He asked about it, and I told him the truth - Matt and I have gone on a few dates, but are not togethere... lol this knowledge comes from a convo I forced myself to go thru w/ Matt about an hour before talkin' to derek.  I guess I wanted to talk to him about where we stand and stuff.... I didn't want to tell Derek something taht changed next week.  So the outcome is that Matt is like crazy for me, but not my bf.  Thank god... no bf for Ali.  At least not now... besides, I am having way to much fun being single.  I am dying to go to prom w/ Derek, we will have a blast!!! I dont think Matt would enjoy it anyways... for one thing, he is 21 and kinda old for a high school prom.  Another thing is that he knows nobody and why would I want to spend every second with him and have to introduce him to everybody.  Ugh, no thanks... I'll stick to somebody from my school. Plus Derek is so awesome and we always have fun together.  Always.  So I told derek how we are not togehter and stuff, and he's cool now.  He said he didn't care.  Thank god.  

I'm going to Hawii w/ Ash!! Hehe I'm excited.  Ma mere said I can't get a tattoo tho, which sucks.  Haha, her actual words were ""if you get one, i dont wnat to know about it"".  Hmm.... 

Oh, I am seriously considering the whole public university thing now.  All my work buddies LOVE USF and so why not go somewhere free for 4 yrs? I have the 3 years of law school to pay mucho money and the undergrad years would help save for that... something to think about.  Esp. if I went to USF bc I'd be so close to home, and I bet my dad would get me a kick ass aptmt!  But this of course, is just thinking.. I'm still not sure where  iwil go.  My dad and I are going to stetson on the 27th for a jr open house... so Stetson is not out of the picture... its kinda scary to think about tho... I have to apply for college pretty much as soon as school starts next yr.  It scares me.  I'll probably apply to a few places, and skip to Early Admission at stetson.  You have to sign a contract with that, saying you will go there if accepted.

Its kinda weird... hes like 30, and I'll admit, a very attractive guy, but he's joking and hitting on me now, rather then pointing out my mistakes like he did before.  I know I know, hes a perv for hitting on 17 yr old girls... lol you shoud hear him, its kinda sick... talkin about sex and all that, I dont enjoy it too muchn, but I have to say its a lot better then before and at least I dont dread working w/ him anymore.  Ha its just kinda weird how he massages my arm and rubs my hand... lol oh well... better then getting yelled at.  besides thats how he is w/ all his fav ppl so I guess I'm just ""IN"" now.

"event","I had a very good day today.

So yesterday I had to leave school because I was getting a migrane... god it was HORRIBLE. I was real tired, and then my head started to hurt.  In Dane's words I looked ""terrible"".  But I layed in the clinic for about an hour, hoping I could just sleep it off, but school was too damn cold, and I couldnt rest at all, so I just went home where I slept and watched No Doubt's Making The Video.  That song sucks ass.  I worked for a while, then went home and slept. 

So maybe it was that I was asleep last night by 10pm, or maybe it was just a good day.  But seriously, I was very happy.  Things went good.  School was not too bad.  After I got home I called Matt to find out what time I worked today cuz I had forgotten.  He told me then called me right back to say he was workin' a double, and was off for about an hour.  He wanted to take me to eat, so I went up there and we went across the street to Ruby Tuesdays.  He swears they gave us a bunch of free shit bc the guy knew he was another waiter, but I dunno, the guy could have just been really cool. I had to work at 4, and Matt was back on at 430, so we got back to MacGrill. Right at 4 Derek came in to check his sched and get some food.  Since it was slow as hell, I sat down w/ him and we talked about prom.  YES he gets to drive the BMW... I am so excited! We will have a great time I know it.  Kinda funny... Matt sees me talkin' to him and kinda walks up and puts his hand on my leg like I am his... I was amused... It was pretty obvious he got jealous... I think he was expecting me to get him to go to prom w/ me but really, I dont have any desire to go w/ a guy thats not from my school, plus derek is AWESOME and i love him t odeath. I'm excited... but yea, Matt seemed kinda teritorial when I was chatting with derek.  Cute and funny at the same time I guess... but I am completely not jealous of him so I just hope jealousy isnt a big prob with him. He's not my bf and I'm not going to act like he is.  Wow I really do love my job.  I have a lot of fun there sometimes and really, the people are great.  I had a lot of fun working today, lol so much that I didnt want to leave... homework isnt too appealing.  Besides, some cuties from LOL came in and kept telling Monica and Laura how hott I am... not too bad.  hehe at least they are my age... so after I get home and finally begin working on my history I realize kevin gave me his folder and I hadn't gotten it out in a while.  Ms K really does reuse all her worksheets and his was sitting right on top with a big 20/20 at the top.  So it didnt take me too long 2 do that.  So its 1 and I'm tired. I'm going to bed so I can wake up at 630, have a long day at school, then go to the library to do all the topic stuff for my term paper.  If we are still going bowling let me know cuz I'lll need a fun ending to tomorrow, it will most likely suck."

Ha, so I have to work tomorrow for Laura... how fun, but you know, now that I am use to working all the time, its really not bad to do... I have fun there, kinda.  Sometimes. LOL, but the ppl are nice and usually I don't do much work, just talk.  

Today at school wasnt too bad, and amazingly enuf I had fun on my day back... how odd.  Ash and I both had to get gas so we headed to the Hess after classes were out.  Ha, then I had to get some $$ out of the bank, so Ash spotted some hott  guy driving by and we jumped in our cars to follow him across bruce b downs into the winn dixi parking lot (we didn't really have anything else to do).  LOL so I never got a chance to look, but Ashleigh told me he was pretty hott, and she wrote her # and name on paper and I put it on his windsheild wipers... we kinda just did it as a joke, to see if the dude would actually call.  HE DID... lol, about 5 seconds after his gf called.... poor ash got bitched at by a strange girl... haha then the guy, Richard, called and they talked.  Ash decided not to call back b/c he has a gf, then did anyways... lol we find out he is 22.  And she has to get on me for Matt... geez.  Age doesnt matter too much I guess... and hey at least he can buy me drinks! LOL, I want to try out Bailey's Irish Cream... and I guess I can go out drinkin' w/ all my work buddies if I wanted to... um yea so I guess that guy will call ash back if he ever breaks up with his girl.  Haha, how cute! After our adventure w/ the strange hott guy, I headed over to Matt's... we ate lunch and he helped me w/ my french hw... haha tried is more like it. We didnt get much done... his older brother James (that is who matt lives w/) showed up a little while after i got there and we all chatted about some chi decorating stuff.... lol james was real drunk and bought some book about it online and it came today, so he's reading all about how the chinese decorate their houses.... kinda nice.  Let me tell you tho, James is HOT. And I believe 26 to go with it... haha his nipples are peirced tho, how sick is that? EWW I can't stand it, too sensitive.  I got my nails done today, which made me 20 minutes late to my psych class... and I was STARVING! There is nothing worse then sitting thru that class when you are hungry... we do have a break, but th only food they really have is like chips and candy, and thats really not good when u want a sandwich ya know?  After class was out, I get back to my car and find 4 voice mails from laura begging me to work for her tomrrow... lol so she can go prom dress shopping... i said yes... 

.... hmmm reminds me, I really really need to get my butt moving and start thinkin' about prom a little bit... I havent heard anything about it, are there any parties afterwards? Where is everybody eating? I really need a dress and shoes!!!!!! I'll have to talk to Derek... 

Hey did i mention my parents are going out of town april 27th? Its a little ways from now, but still... I cant wait! What shouold I do? Let me know if you guys have any ideas ok? I'll cya tomorrow I'm going to bed! Love ya!"

So the last few days I've spend w/ my best friend in tampa - NICOLE!! We never get to see e/o anymore! She even went to my psych class!!!! LOL how wonderful... and I've now met pretty much all her friends.  Parties galore let me tell u! I dunno that I like these Tampa ppl... I'm not too big on the glow stick flipping and white boys saying ""the N word"" to all their white friends.  How dumb.  Another thing... why the hell am I called a ""snob"" for not flirting w/ a guy who I know has a gf? I mean... we are all crammed in my car, when out of nowhere he decided to blirt out how I am ""amazingly hott"" and how much he would love to take me out... to this Nicole responds, ""NICK you have a girlfriend!"" He thinks this is no big deal I guess bc 5 min later he is saying how we should be making out in the movie... UM NO... so bc i reject this kind of wonderful flirtation I am a snob... how sweet.  Boys are so dumb... and just for the record, this guy Nick is also at the older age being 22.... god damn these older boys.  Ha so other then the uncomfy sit w/ him blirting comments out, i really enjoyed the movie.  Last night, Nicole got pissed at the guy she is dating, and we decided all boys suck, got a pizza, some ben & jerrys, chips, and watched GI Jane.  Haha now that was fun! Girl time is the best tho... 

Today I had to work, kinda fun... the biggest prob is that Leigh is so damn nosey.  About EVERYTHING! God, she assumes so much... I can't stand talking to her! Aw Janine, the other hostess, almost died when I left (i was first out) her w/ Leigh... lol i thin the whole resterant hates her! I heard they are looking for a reason to fire her! LOL... After work ash and I saw Sorority Boys... it was so funny and a LOT better then we expected.  Also we went for bagels at Panaras.... TJ totally hooked us up w/ lots of pastry things which we chowed on during our moive... haha tonight was actually the first time Ash and I have hung out all SB.... crazy bc we are practically joined at the hip! Like i told her, no body can make me feel so dumb and shitty or bring me down lol but hey, she is the person I turn to for those things... haha I'm playing, the bitch is always cheering me up... so all and all it was a great night.  

Oh I got an email from Kev today... just like, ""hey we havent talked in a long time... I'm coming home this weekend, ive been really really busy w/ classes lately"" then like 20 min later he wrote me another email saying ""i realized I forgot to tell you that i miss you.  I am so sorry we got off the phone like we did last time we talked... I cant believe we havetn talked in a few weeks, but I've tried not to think about it... Ive been missing you... hopefully you feel the same way"" something like that.  I'm not sure how to take it... but it was nice to hear from him.  We need to talk I think... he is my best friend, even if he's not my boyfriend, and I think things were great when we both decided that no matter what we would still be best friends... ha still hard considering we dated for forever... oh well.... we will talk eventually and hopefully not get into a fight like last time we talked..

Wow, I dont miss school at all! I dont want to go back!!!! The only night I dont have to work all week is thursayd, which is kinda cool cuz I think I'm gonna go bowling w/ Dane and Ticha and Chris and all those guys... it was fun last time even tho i suck! I dunno if they still are going, or if I'm invited... I'll have to talk to somebody about it and find out.

Yea so today was a pretty dull day... it began horribly with chem... I swear, Ms Ingrassia (sp?) is such an awesome women, but her class is HORRIBLE! I can never stay awake in there... French was bad as always and it was even worse trying to keep my eyes open in there... Aw at lunch I talked to that cute little guy Eduardo more today at lunch... lol we are slowwwllllyyy becoming friends! During study hall I ended up talking to Sean about prom and ended up spending the whole time doing that... kinda boring but hey whatever.  We had a lock down which made pre cal a shorter period... how wonderful... normally that would have been great, but some people piss me off esp. in bockus' study hall... ugh, I don't understand how I was best friends w/ some ppl for so long and now just have no desire to say a word to them... weird.  Pre cal was easy thank god, and then I was forced to stay after school to do more prom talk.  We actually did not talk about prom at all... just got stuck in another lock down and sat there waisting valuable time I could have been sleeping thru.... :( We went to Windys after and I felt horrible borrowing $$... I am so damn broke and have been forever it seems! I'm so sick of not having money and everyone offered me some so i could snack too... ugh I hate spending other ppl's money... friday friday fridya... then I get paid! No more being poor!  I got home after dropping off Tranice... took a nice nap, then began work for this history project... I said I would get it done today and thank god I did! I even died the paper to make it look old so I'm kinda proud.. hopefully it will look good after being colored!  I guess Dane and I will put it all together tomrrow after school... it will be nice to have this project over! 

Wow only 2 more days... how wonderful! I plan on being very lazy, catching up on sleep, and getting a lot of hw and studying done! I have absolutely no fun plans for SB... I'm sure it will be a blast tho! 

OMG I love this song.... 

See, when I get the strength to leave
you, always tell me that you need
me, and I'm weak cause I believe
you, and I'm mad because I love
you. so I stop and think that
maybe, you can learn to appreciate
me, then it all remains the same
that, you ain't never gonna change

ha this has nothing to do w/ me and doesnt apply to life... but a great song! Aw it would be so damn depressing if that did apply to life.... 

Hey, Kenny asked me out today.... well sorta, through Jenny.... hmm lately she just IMs me from Kevin S's sn... doesnt have her own I know,  but still its like she just WANTS me to know she's over there and of course still dating him.... yet another discusting reminder that they are together... I can't believe my x would date a girl like her... dont get me wrong, I seriously love Jenny to death, but she is a whore, and I kinda hate that my first love has to date a girl like her, even if i did only date him back freshman year.... lol hopefully my more recent kevin x is dating somebody beter.... OH YEA anyways, so she IMs me and is like ""Junior wants me to ask if you will go out with him?"" Um no! He sorta was in love w/ my cousin recently correct? How gross... not to mention I havent talked to the boy in about a year! Wonder where that idea came from... 

haha well Dane was right... this little thing is a place to vent... i've wrote a lot now and its wayyy past my bed time.... I'm going to sleep... off to dream of *things* before I am ripped away by Ryan yelling at me to wake up... class at 730 tomorrow!!! :*( So I'll leave ya w/ one cute little quote... g'night!

*~*~*If I could reach up and hold a *STAR* for every time you made me smile, the entire evening sky would be in the palm of my hand*~*~*"

"event","Wow, I am neglecting my history project to get this thingy up and now I'm actually writing in it!! Ha I'm not sure I have much to say... or the time to say it tonight at least!  But I'm pretty proud that I got all this set up... Dane is the coolest for showing it to me, gettin' that code, and teaching me how to do it all... lol, I seem to be helpless w/o that boy! What exactly am I supposed to write on here? And do people actually read it? How do people know what my thing is? I guess these are questions I am gonna have to get replies to... tonight I am very stressed w/ the load of work we have for history, so I'm not really able to write anything great... I'll just leave it at this and hope to get some replies k?"

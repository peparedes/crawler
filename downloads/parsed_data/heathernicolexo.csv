"event","Do you feel every feeling 
from one end of the spectrum to the other?
Do you go low, into the pits of dispair
And come up, laughing like you never cared?
(though of course, you do still do)
Are you easily stimulated
Do you love to feel good?
Do you curse the day you were born
And long for the day you will die
Does ""nobody"" understand
Do you sometimes wish you could fly?
Away from the troubles
Straight into the air
Never come down
At least, 'til the world decides to be fair ...
Are you capable of loving
In ways they just don't understand
Of more than just one person
A woman or a man?
Two of each? Four of one?
Do you sometimes feel to much?
Anger, resentment,
joy and ... Love."

"event","Well then, what's there to talk about? Well, English week was a phenomenal success. Even though my grade lost the Spelling bee. It was quite hard, I tell you there were even some words that I had trouble spelling (can't think of any right now...)

My teacher however, continues to be gravely ill. She's hospitalized in Manati and quite possibly needs some heart surgery or something like that. The school refuses to give me details. I still continue to make plans and activities though, but I guess I'm realllly flying solo now. 

Today was the grand opening of the Chocobo Racing event in FFXI! Tanosis (Louis) ranked pretty high (like a 5 or something), so he can have the honor of saying he has a bitchin' fast chocobo. You can also have friendly races, so this weekend it's gonna be Ciel Comet (Louis' Chocobo), Amatsuke Death (His brother's choby), Lady Wind (Brother's girlfriend) and Firecracker Rice (mine ^_^) racing it off to decide who is the best choby eva!!!

Sometimes I amaze myself with my geekness....

I got Louis all to myself this weekend ^_^ You all know what that means...

ENDLESS DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION AND FFXI!!!!!!!!! HELL YEAH!

Log out for now!!"

I'll go with the logic that parents hate everything we like, so I'll go with the it looks good option. Louis hasn't seen it though.

I've become legally addicted to Scrubs, LOL. I laughed so hard with yesterday's comedy central episode!! (The one where Karla loses the stuffed dog, I think it's Rowdy? I forget...) My boyfriend got so mad when I bailed on him in FFXI to watch it, lol.

I bought the Marilyn Manson greatest hits CD. Granted I am not an OMG it's Marilyn Manson Fan, but the CD has the exact songs I like, so I bought it and downloaded it to my Ipod. Ah...The memories. I remembered our ""Goth years"" back in high school. The ones where I'd paint my lips purple, use a spike choker (I still have it) and walk around with my emo friend Louis. Who would only wear black, write emo poetry and complain about how black nail polish never looked good on him. Come to think of it, he hasn't changed much (still only wears black, but minus the poetry and nail polish Thank God). Yes, I thank Marilyn Manson for giving me good friends like that.

Well, that's it for now. See ya all!"

"event","As the subject said, today I had my first foray into the incredible world of: Parent-Teacher conference. The subject today at hand: The infamous Banned books project. It was quite unusual actually, but I had already prepared a battle plan for this one.

My class is currently on the English week talent show and play. Since the teacher is sick and hospitalized, I'm flying solo for this week. Still, the backgrounds needed to be done and talent show rehearsals needed to be supervised so the agenda was full. 

Then the intercom buzzes. (Yes there's an intercom in every classroom). The principal says there is a parent couple that wants to talk to me right now about the project. She also asks if she wants me to allow her to be in the conference. I say: ""No, but thanks for the offer. I'll yell at the intercom if anything.""

I left the kids working on the backgrounds and met the parents of a girl student in my class in the privacy of the English Classroom. They were lawyers or something of the like, both well dressed in suits. The mother looked happy to see me, the father looked angry at the sight of me in jeans, a t-shirt and paint all over my hands.
This is how it went (roughly translated into english for your amusement):

Me: Good morning! I'm Miss Cardona, how can I help you today?

Mother: Good morning to you. We're the parents of (insert girl's name here, can't remember her name anyways)

Father: Where's the real teacher?

Me: She's sick.

Mom: That's allright. It's actually you we want to talk to. Actually it's my husband who wants to talk to you.

Me: Oh? What is the problem? Your daughter is a pretty good student in my class. She's actually excited about the upcoming project. *Smile*

Father: That's the problem. *Shoves a copy Speak on my desk* This book is about sex. My daughter says you assigned it to her. *mother looks at ceiling*

Me: *Looks at book and smiles* Your daughter made an excellent choice of book. Yes, I assigned along with other books of similar content.

Father: I don't want my daughter reading a book about sex!

Mother: I read the book after my daughter told me it had rape in it. But I don't find it offensive, he does though.  

Me: I see.

Father: You have no bussiness assigning this book to kids.

Me: With all due respect, I do. The school approved it, the teacher approved it and the students chose the book. Have you read it?

Father: Er...no. But it has sex!

Me: no, it has rape. another matter entirely. The book explains a young girl's recovery from that traumatizing experience and encourages girls to speak against such acts, report them to authorities, seek help and avoid such situations. If you read between the lines it actually encourages girls to be more careful so they won't get into the same situation. It also helps provide an insightful view into what is high school life. 

Mother: That is very true. 

Father: But it's too strong a book for a seventeen year old!

Me: *Smiley face* Is it? Is your daughter going to college, sir?

Father: Yes. To Mayaguez actually.

Me: You must be proud. *He nods* Now sir, professors in college actually assign stuff with actual sex scenes in it and you're not going to travel all the way to Mayaguez to explain to him that you don't want your daughter reading anything rated PG-13 or above. Besides, she's pretty much an adult now, she should not only have learned about sex in health class by now, but also about freedom of speech and choice in history class. Which she is practicing right now within her own right as an independent individual that will soon be a legal adult. I gave your daughter an assignment where she needs to make an intelligent decision based on a book she read, isn't that what you have been teaching your daughter before she came to my classroom? To make intelligent decisions, at least regarding everyday decisions?

Father: . . .

Mother: I know I have. *glares at father*

Me: *smile smile* Don't worry sir. I know what I assigned. You can sleep soundly thinking that your daughter is not being encouraged to have sex. And might I recommend reading the book yourself sir? If you don't you'll only be teaching your daughter that books with taboo words are evil.

Father: Oh, sure thing. I trust my daughter's judgement.

Mother: Thanks for listening to us.

Me: Sure thing. Anything else you come straight to me.

Father: Oh well, thank you. 

*They leave*

The evil me in my brain: Your kid should've picked a bigger book to stick up your ass....

End of PT meeting.

It was fun. Whatever, nothing can beat a smart assing a parent."

"event","Well, I had my first evaluation. It went rather nicely. I presented the ""Banned books project"" in which they were to have a mock trial to either defend or condemn a book. The got overly excited and even managed to almost literally fight to the death for the books. Here were the books they could choose from:

The Illustrated Brother's Grimm Fairy tales
The Outsiders
The Chocolate War - Beyond the Chocolate War
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
Baby Be-Bop
The Rose and the Beast: Fairy tales retold
My Brother Sam is Dead
Farenheit 451
Speak
Ready or Not
A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beggining
The Giver
The Bluest Eye

After explaining the book's accusations, they were allowed to pick one for their project. Here are the ones they fought tooth and nail for:
Speak - Guys and girls wanted this one so bad, I had to intervene.
The Chocolate war- Beyond the chocolate war. - After reading the first page of the book, twelve students wanted this AND the sequel.
The Rose and the Beast - We're ordering 9 copies from amazon. Need I say more?
The Giver - Puritans were outraged by the concept of infanticide. However, everyone is on the not guilty list. Can't wait to see this one.
Ready or not- Guys avoided this one like the plague, but girls were up for it.

Among the others chosen- only three people (one team) among the two groups chose H.Potter. No one picked Series of Unfortunate events, Farenheit 451 (Although I told them that it was an incredibly hard book to find) or My brother Sam is dead (that book sucks anyways) The Bluest Eye also had one team, while Narnia had two. The Outsiders, only gathered the attention of two kids and they decided to work against each other. Since it was on friendly terms, I'm actually excited about how that debate will turn out.

For now, I'm Happy. the project is working. They WANT to read.

On to other subjects, My evaluation went well, and I want to congratulate my darling Louis on finally becoming a wonderfully destructive level 75 Black mage in FFXI after 3 years. *sniff, sniff* I'm so proud!! Go merit point hunting hunny!!! 

We went to chilli's last night to celebrate my evaluation. I had fajitas, yum!

Gotta go, I have six cases to prepare. Good luck to all!!!"

It was the best I could do in such short time. Cool huh?

Still I think I did pretty good. I was actually more confident in myself than I was with the ninth grade last year. The big kids somehow make feel more sure of myself, as if there was nothing in the world that could ruin my life. I know it sounds cheesy, but hey I'm not lying.

Yesterday, I read (more like skimmed) the site Naida suggested once, where there is a blog thing with entertainment news (I forget the name, it's in my favorites at home). I was shocked to find a picture of what I thought was a sexy (if too white and slightly hairy for my taste) young man with no shirt. Imagine what happened when I put on my glasses to read the fine print and actually look at his face only to stumble into a sexy Daniel Radcliffe!!! Oh me, oh my. Harry's gone sexy?!!! What the freakin' fuck?! He has muscles (or a vague impression for his age)?! Oh my!!!! The world is getting strange. . .

Besides, that last boss is a pussy. There has got to be a unmatched, strength eating, oh my god I suck at level 99, it has to be immortal boss in there somewhere. Plus, I still haven't been able to figure out if Balthier is saying Mallorca when he attacks.

Overall, it was awesome ending to an awesome game. Balthier, I shall love thee always! (he gave the killing blow).

My arm is purple now, thanks to Cat. And it hurts like bloody murder. Of course she had to bite the arm I use to everything... (I am left handed)Not to mention that Deb's bite also hurts, just not as much as Cat's. It made that last FFXII boss fight a little more difficult.

I passed my pre-practicum course. Quite possibly with an A, oh wait THAT IS AN A!!!! and made mom cry,... again. I'm gonna miss the kids but, oh well. I also finished betaing (is that how you use the word Mari?), my cousin's FFXII fanfic (shudders). I'm sorry to say that this one has no illegal butt-babies, Andy. But (no pun intended), there is much manly loving between the three male leads (Basch was forgiven and loved by his friends, especially Balthier). Not bad, disgusting for my taste, but not badly written.

I guess I'll be returning to FFXI now...oh wait...is that another fic in my inbox? NOOOOO!!!!

For those who don't knnow who she is, she is the author of the Princess Diaries, among many other books. I had a blast. We even spoke to her and told her we were teachers. At first she didn't believe us, but then she did. we even asked her what her favorite color is.

My boyfriend dropped by a little later, but left us to our thing, because the event was too pink and girly. I let it slide that one time. LOL

I bought the Return to Labyrinth Manga. It's not that great though, but definately a good read. Maybe the second volume is better.

To end this entry, all I have to say is: I SAW MEG CABOT!!!!!  EEEEEEEEEEK!!!!!!

P.S. - ANdy-chan stole Meg's decorative tiara!!!"

I went to the authentic Mexican wedding and I had a blast. I even got drunk. My shoes broke as soon as I got out of the car, but when I tried to fix them, the bride laughed and threw them away. ""No one dances with shoes in these parties."" And boy I tell you, she was right. Mario's cousin, ironically called Victor, tried to hit on me and even asked me to sleep with him, but almost cried when I said that he was cute, but I had a boyfriend I missed very much. He said he was a lucky man. I hope he's right about that.

"event","Well, I'm packing. Today we're heading out to Virginia to an authentic Mexican wedding. Mario's closest cousin is getting married and since we're family now, we get to go. However, since we're leaving on monday, when we return from Virginia, they're dropping us off in Orlando International airport so we can go home. Louis is so excited that I'm going home that, he's going to pick us up. 

My Ipod Already has 52 songs. Only 400 and something to go. My mom is angry that I'm only putting music in it, but I told her I didn't want anything else in it. Then she got mad cuz I downloaded most of the Kingdom Hearts II soundtrack into it. She said she didn't want game music in there. Afterwards my sister got mad at her and told her it wasn't her IPod but mine and that she was never gonna use it anyways.

Mom definately needs to go home. She's being a bitch about everything. Last night, we were looking for a nice shirt for Mario and a dress for me. Mario got mad because when I tried a dress on she said I looked like a cow with huge breasts. Before I could say anything, he told my mom that in Mexico skinny girls are a bad omen and that he noticed that she was more or less the same size as me, maybe bigger. After she left (incredibly angry), we laughed, he said the skinny girl thing was a lie, but that we all can't be like my sister. When I asked him if he thought I was fat. He called my sister over and asked her if I was fat.  When she said no, he said that if I could still find clothes my size in a regular store, I was okay. We laughed at that, but mom got angrier. Then we all made fun of her. I can see why my sister likes Mario. He's the complete opposite of mom.

Well, I'm gonna put some more music on ""POOD"", my IPod, and log off. Hopefully my next post will be from PR."

Of course, That means that now Mario, my sister's mexican boyfriend, is now family. Which also created shockwaves in my family. My sister is already deciding on the nursery motif. Tinkerbell if it's a girl and suggested by me, marvel superheroes for a boy. (they have a baby line). Mario wants soccer if it's a boy. We all said that was okay as long as he doesn't paint the walls yellow and blue (his team colors). Just to piss of mom, I said the nursery should be Fruits basket if it's a girl, and Fullmetal alchemist if it's a boy. My sister and Mario played along, and mom was fuming. NO ANIME FOR THE BABY!!!!!

I'll be coming home next monday. FINALLY!!! I'm so behind on everything. I wanna hang out as soon as I get home. As well as seeing my boyfriend. 

I earned a little extra money from the library. I think I'm gonna buy myself a Nintendo DS. Not sure though. Well, I'll decide later.

I bought a couple of purses in St. Agustine and the most peculiar thing, an small 6 inch statue of arcangel Michael. No, he's not a superhero, he's a catholic icon. 

My sister took us to a church in St. Agustine that is a huge garden. Although I'm catholic (sort of), I hate churches. But there was something about this huge old garden that seemed almost,...spiritual. For once, I felt at ease somewhere in this disgusting country. Of course, since there is a pathway through the gardens and people pray there, they don't allow pics. WHen we got to the gift shop, I saw the beautiful white statue of arcangel Michael, the smiter of all evil. I liked it cuz he didn't look like a sissy.

I can't wait to go home. I can't wait to see Louis, sleep in my bed (with my orthopedic pillow) and play Final Fantasy XI. Not only that, I miss little things like, sleeping in my undies, picking up books wherever I like and hanging out with people my who don't keep telling how much my life sucks. 

I opened up a myspace account by the way. I'll tell you more about it when I'm done."

"event","Sigh, still in Jacksonville. I'm probably around 80 pounds heavier since I've been trying all the food I can't get in PR. Today, it was Boston Market. Turkey is definately a nice food group...

Yesterday I went to an electronics store with my sis and mom. I was amazed to find the elusive 2GB Ipod Nano for 120 bucks. Since I didn't have any money (I left it all in PR, thinking Banco Popular ATMs were useful here), imagine my surprise when unloading the stuff we bought in the car I found a black Ipod Nano in the bags. Apparently, my sister called her boyfriend and all three of them chipped in to get for me. (""CD players are so out, Val"" -My sis quote) They said I worked too hard and got very little joys in my life and that Ipods are way expensive in PR. ""Just enjoy it, sis. Think of it as a very delayed reward for getting farther than me in college."" I enjoyed the gift and named it ""Pood"". I know Pamela will get the joke. Cuz I told her once that scottish Ipods are called Ipoods. It isn't one of those immensely evil ones. It only holds 500 songs, but still, I like it. It's tiny, just like me. lol.

My sisters boyfriend is an Ebay junkie. But he gets cool bargains all the time. Of course, since he saw I loved Final Fantasy, he got me two more watches so I could make a collection. One is FFVIII and the other is FFX. They were like ten bucks each. Still, its a nice gesture. My sister said its cuz likes us. He got my mom an antique coca-cola wall clock. My sister says he does that with his family. So apparently we're family to him. That's cool. I really wish he'd stay with my sis cuz he's nice.

The FIFA world cup started today. It's awesome! I saw the first two games. The first was Costa Rica vs. Germany. It was tight, but Germany won 4-2. The second game was even cooler. Poland vs. Ecuador. Apparently, according to my sister's boyfriend, Ecuador made history today, since it's the first time they win anything at all at the cup. As you may know, Ecuador won, 2-0. But the Polacks played awesome. Mexico plays on sunday versus Iran, so tune in to Univision at 11:30 to see it. I have to admit it's a very thrilling sport. If you understand Quidditch, you'll understand soccer at the start. They only stop when a player can't get back up and the game ends when the penalties are paid for in extra time. (basically all penalties are turned to extra time after the game ""ends""). Mario says it's a little more complicated, but thats what I got so far.

Anyways, still no return date. Can't wait to get home. Good luck y'all."

I went to this huge mall, where I bought some clothes at the Hot Topics Store there (which had a huge selection), then we ate a Chick-fil-a (which I didn't know what it was), then finally went to Best Buy (where the sell really cheap anime I got FMA 6 for like 15 bucks). Finally we went to the paradise of all paradises, Barnes & Noble, where my sister made fun of me cuz I looked like an anime girl when they have their eyes all big with the little stars on their eyes.

Today I went to a true-blue Sushi Bar, the kind where they make the food in front of you. My nephew had a blast. They even made an onion volcano. It was da bomb. The name of the place in Kan-ki so if you're in Jax, give it try. It's probably the only civilized thing there.

I bought a good luck dragon in a japanese store for Louis and a Good luck kitty for my sister (a blue one for health). Luckily, her results came in and she has no tumor or aneurism or anything. I might go home soon. 

If anyone is interested, this Sunday marks the beggining of the FIFA world cup. It only comes once every four years. My sister's mexican boyfriend is possibly one of the biggest Soccer fans around, so you can imagine how excited he is. He's been telling me about one of the ""Mexican Soccer gods"" Cuauhtemoc Blanco, who frankly put, plays freakin' awesome!!! So believe it or not, I'm excited. GO MEXICO!!!!!

"event","Well, to everyone who actually pays attention to this half-assed journal, this is me, live from wonderful Jacksonville, Florida. I left last Saturday cuz my sister got really sick and both my mom and myself were needed here. So two days after Louis B-day, I left at seven in the morning. 

Trip aside, I celebrated Louis' birthday (on the 25th) with a blast. Well, sort of. He loved the Megaman Action figures I bought in Rio Piedras with Mari and Deborah and Mom bought him a three layer chocolate cake. Then he confessed to me that his mother and brother actually forgot his birthday. So making sure he would enjoy his 23rd B-day, I took him out for dinner and serious DDR playing. Then mom called and we made a small party with my cousin, mother and granny. He had a blast. Even cried and everything.

Later on, I left PR. I hate Jax with a passion. The only good thing here is the food. There's Red Lobster and Olive Garden and a whole bunch of places there aren't in PR. I met my sisters Mexican boyfriend/husband, Mario, who for real, eats everything with some sort of hot sauce. Including peaches (yuck!). But he is incredibly nice. He even let me connect my PS2 so I could play FFXI.

My nephew is actually a cool kid. He lets me use his Teen Titans comforter set and watch FMA in his room at midnight by myself cuz that's a grown-up cartoon. But sometimes he's a little too friendly.

I can't call Louis that much (There's only one phone, and it's a cell). I miss him soooo much. I can't sleep good, I can't eat well and everything reminds me of him. I email him, I talk to him in FFXI, but it's not the same. ... I guess I never thought I would feel this way toward anyone in my life. What makes me feel worse is that my trip...well...it was only a one way ticket. I'm afraid to call him for fear that he won't care anymore or that he'll ask when I come back. Shit...now my eyes are teary again.

I gotta go...I'll post again soon."

"event","It was heartbreaking to hear about Mari's brother last friday. I never know what to say at a time like this. But Mari, if you are reading this, I offer my deepest condolences.

This weekend has been strange to say the least. It's one of those when you realize that there is slightly more to life than just being on the sidelines. I know Vik and Mari would have been proud of me had they seen the feat that I accomplished last Saturday. 

It was my dad's birthday this weekend. So of course, my grandfather, my uncles and cousins came by and made us all go to dinner with him and my poor excuse of a father. So my boyfriend and I were lugged off to a nearby Longhorn's restaurant. Where I immediately noticed, as the black sheep of the family, that we were their entertainment. 

It started as it always did. Nice at first, but then the humilliating jokes began. First, it was the whole ""dad is ashamed to be my dad routine"" , then the ""aren't you ashamed that you still live with your mother? routine"" and lastly the ""your cousins are younger and they already have diplomas routine"". Then when I just stayed quiet, they just preyed on my unsuspecting boyfriend. 

But of course, he didn't have any of it. Nicely, he told them to stop it. Then my dad got mad and asked me where did I find this piece of shit man. 

And you know what? For once in my life, following Mari and Vik's eternal advice to stop being nice to everyone, I told my dad that at least he was nicer than he ever had been in his life and that I was sick and tired of them humiliating me whenever possible. Lastly, I told everyone at the table what they deserved. That my cousins had diplomas because they all did the 2-year study grado asociado thing  and they really didn't care about true education, that I still lived with my mother because thanks to them I have to work for a living, that I hated these dinners and that when I graduated I wasn't gonna thank any of them. Then I went on and on spilling everyone's shames, ending it all with a very loud, ""Hey dad, you say I have shitty boyfriend but at least I didn't marry my own cousin. Now that's fucking pathetic."" Then I grabbed my purse, said fuck you to all of them and left. My boyfriend did the honors of escorting me outside and tell me that that was the coolest outburst he's ever seen. Truth be told I was surprised myself. But it felt good. 

Then as I laughed about it along with my boyfriend, we went to Mc'Donalds and had dinner there. And that was perhaps the best dinner I ever had in my life."

By my own free will (as many of you know), I am doing independent research on banned Young adults books. I discovered many and even sent an article to many of you. However, since my co-workers in the library saw me with new books almost daily, as well as my friends, they suggested a start a review thread for old, new, banned and not banned YA books. The only requirement would be my having read the book. If you guys would read it and contribute comments, I'd gladly do it. Let me know.

On another note, about my life, well, let see...

I started ""the pill"". The one that actually controls my period and one of many health issues. Now I don't have to worry about getting pregnant. LOL, with mister paranoia as my boyfriend, that's very unlikely to happen even without the pill. I don't mind though. Since my operation, it's been kinda hard to do anything anyways. 

In other news, I'm finally a Paladin level 52 in final fantasy XI. I'm gonna work on getting my Artifact armor now ^.^ My darling Erindyll will finally look threatning enough. My boyfriend said he never expected me to like the job so much. I guess it just suits me. He thinks so too. Bad part is, my linkshell group calls me ""the mighty Tarudin"". Not a bad nickname, but they make it hard for people to take me seriously.

Gotta go now, lemme know about the reviews.

In my PS2- shifts between FFXI and Wild Arms: alter code F
In my CD palyer- Circo- en el cielo de tu boca

Well, not much in my life. Today I went to the mall and to my surprise found out that Suncoast is no longer selling manga. I almost cried. As a consolation, mom bought me some sushi at the food court. It was yummy and I managed to eat it with chopsticks.

My boyfriend has an incredible fear of me since the day the doctor told me I could have sex again. I don't blame him, poor guy practically had to limp home that day. *laughs maniacally as she thinks of this* Oh well, it's his fault for not saying no.

I have been watching musicals this weekend, well not many. I saw Moulin Rouge (which I adored, cried and laughed with). My cousin loved it and though I was pleased, it was sad to hear that any guy who loved Moulin Rouge is guy by default. If this is true, I don't know and would like to be clarified on this. But if it is true, then I knew he was gay all along. Woo-hoo! I guess I have that little sister I always wanted. I also bought and saw Phantom of the Opera (the new one) and Chicago. They were both awesome and loved them as much, if not more than Moulin Rouge. If anyone has more recommendations, feel free to tell me.

Well, as for me I have to go for now. But feel free to drop me an e-mail or comment. i could use the company.

My kleptomaniacal sister is coming over to visit, so I'm doing movie inventory (which I might post at a later date here)and music inventory (jokes on her, I copied mp3 files of her favorites in my PC) and grandma will make her disturbing ""pasteles"" which you never know what's in them because she forgets to mark them as she makes them.This year my boyfriend is invited to the ""family gathering"" on the 25th, where he will fall prey to the boozed up family his girlfriend has and be insulted, flirted with and ultimately made to cry with sharp comments while I wonder how expensive my Valentine's day candy for myself will be next year again and what depressing guy-doesn't-get-girl movie I'll watch. 

Don't you just love the holidays? I know I do, even with the sarcastic heading and disturbing paragraph I just wrote.

I watched the Fullmetal ALchemist dvd (vol.1), it was fucking awesome! Played FFXI (PLD level 37), and recently acquired the remake of WIld arms. I also ""borrowed"" my boyfriends PSP. Since my CD player finally keeled up and died. Oh well...

Merry Christmas everyone!!"

"event","Hello! I know it's been some time since I posted, but I've been busy nursing myself back to health. For those who are interested, my laparoscopy went fine.My belly button is hurt though, so I can't make any sudden movements or do any heavy activities. I can still walk and do light stuff though... Either way since so little of my condition was actually found, they actually burned it with a teeny-tiny laser (which in result left stiches) resulting in a two-week long period. Either way, I'm clean now and lucky mee actually gets to start anti-conceptive pills in my next mestrual cycle for prevention of the condition. Since it's prescribed, my medical plan covers it. They probably did all along and I just didn't know >.>

Well, since I was vegetating since Thursday, I managed to do my Book analisys except one. I played FFXI so much, I'm now a Paladin level 36 and people are actually familiar with me. I made so many friends that they're actually going to help me get my AF armor soon ^.^ I'll rule in my Linkshell someday when I'm a Tarutaru tank. :)

Congrats Vik! Beating Maat is no easy task ^.^. I've never done so myself, but I've seen many linkshell videos of people dying horribly by his hand. You should do your missions and get your Promathia expansion so you can take on Diabolos, Ooryu, Bahamut and (pees with joy!) Ulitma and FFV's Omega!!!!!! Yay! Good luck boy!

What's this movie list Horny_4_Ever posted? It looks cool but I don't know what it is T.T can someone explain? Either way, please send me comments or something. Thank you a;;"

I got this in the princess thigy. I think it matches my personality quite well, perticularly since I did lead a group of n00bs in FFXI through an orc nest and got them out all right by myself. Besides, I think that my only lesbian tendency is that I always loved Xena: Warrior princess. She was so much cooler than Hercules, sexier to boot!

As for the Harry Potter Date quiz, since Im running out of time, I didnt post my result. However, I know Mari will kill me, since my HP`perfect date is Fred and George Weasly. Dont worry Mari, Ill share.

Has anyone noticed I havent used a single apostrophe in this whole entrance? I cant find it in this keyboard...

Anyways, for those who are interested in FFXI (guess who I am looking at. LOL) I will soon join the Eudoxia linkshell in our very own Ballista match! Ive never played so Im looking forward to it. We are also going to do a Garrison run, which I hear is like a wave-after-wave attack of monsters. I think all 18 of us are going or whatever, so Ill quite possibly lead in battles, I hope not, cuz I ve never done it. My Paladin teacher says a Garrison is a good training course for future leadership, so I gotta work hard to not dissapoint.Boy, my weekend is gonna be full...

Either way, Im gonna do my homework soon, since Im gonna miss class on wednesday and thursday. Prof. Vazquez isnt gonna pleased if I miss yet another deadline (Olga neither) so I guess I should be happy that my Boyfriend is working the christmas overtime shift. 

Oh well, enouth crap talk. Gotta get to work. Bye for now! =3"

"event","*Once again writing under an alias*

 It was impossible. There was no way he could still be alive. I saw him. He was different, but those piercing eyes were impossible to forget.

 I had been invited to a concert in a very exclusive nightclub called ""Dream Demons"". Many supernatural beings went there, but it had gathered a reputation for the more sinister side of things. Werewolves, Demons and Faeries-for-Hire (like myself) often went there. It was strange when that morning someone from the club personally delivered the invitation. It was to see the private performance of their new singer, who went by the name of Aragannon. Seeing my chance to create always useful contacts, I accepted.

 Seeing as how this was my first visit. I went with proper attire. A long sleeved black turtleneck sweatr, in order to hide my metallic claw and some black dress pants. My long hair was tied up, in case I had to fight. While my dagger was artfully concealed in one of my leather knee high black boots. It didn't hurt to be prepared. 

 When I got to the club, I was immediately escorted inside. I was seated in a room, alone, with a two way mirror showing me the stage. There was a table with food and a full bar so I could prepare any drink I wanted. Then I was told that the person who invited me would join me after the show.What choice did I have? I made myself a drink and sat down in the leather bussiness chair. I didn't wait long for the show to begin.

 When the concert began, I saw who this Aragannon was. He was a beautiful young man, around his mid twenties. He had the body of rock star, tall and well built, but slender, as performing every night under lights usually does to you. He wore a black tanktop and sported two silver chains with dragon charms on them and a silver, spiked choker. He wore hip hugging leather pants and silver tipped biker boots like one of those old school rock gods. His waist-legth raven black hair was half covering his face, but I didn't need to see it to know how this man was. His every movement, every sound, exuded sensuality and confidence. Even with the burning lights on his pale skin, this man was still an incredible sight to behold. 

 As I admired him from the room I was in, my mind began reeling. I had seen this man somewhere. It had been a long time ago. Yet somehow, I couldn't pinpoint it. Perhaps I was wrong. Surely a man as beautiful as this would be remembered in my mind. I had to wait to find out.

 Two hours later, the show ended. I was almost saddened by that. Yet it wasn't long afterwards when Aragannon himself, the singer, stepped into the room I was in. He was just like he was on stage, beautiful, sensual and somehow intimidating. The minute he sat down across from me I knew who he was. His piercing blue eyes gave it away. 

""You know who I am, don't you?"" - He said to me, a grin on that perfect mouth. I couldn't even stand up. It had been so long ago, but either way, I just nodded. For some reason I got nervous as he got nearer to me. Suddenly he was so close he was whispering in my ear.

""It was you who murdered me all those years ago. Remember? With your little friend that raped me before killing me? The one child who begged you for mercy and you killed him heartlessly.""

""I killed my partner for doing that to you."" - I managed to say. Aragannon softly placed his hand on my neck. He did not move at all and to my fear I found I could not move mine either.

""I made sure he stayed dead for that."" - He whispered. Suddenly his grip got incredibly tight and I could barely breathe. - ""But you, you will feel all the pain I did along with the humiliation. I will kill you the same way your friend did to me. And the worst part is you won't be able to do anything because all the things you drank and ate, were drugged.""

That explained why I could no longer move my body. But somehow I was still awake and I noticed that two more people were coming inside the room and closing the curtains on the window I was using to watch the show.

As the two others, a man and a woman started taking off my clothes, Aragannon grinned. 

""I will show you no mercy.""

I was at his mercy. Something told me I was not going to live."

I mean, what can you fight about when both your lives consist of working, studying, going to wonderpark to play DDR and loging in to FFXI at exactly the same time at night in order to go treasure hunting along with the ocasional sex after pizza? If you think about it, it really doesn't leave much space for fighting. 

And yet we always manage to fight somehow...(LOL) Usually about stupid things like Final Fantasy. 

""You could've killed that dragon in one hit!! How could you miss?!!!!!""
""Honey, c'mon it's just a game. We still won, didn't we?""

""It's your fault for choosing a stupid midget as a character!""
""WHAT?!!!""
""It IS a stupid midget. A poor excuse for a hobbit. (refering to my Tarutaru character)!!!""
""TAKE THAT BACK!!!!""

It goes on like this for a while (like five mins.) Until...

*he starts laughing*
""we're fighting over a game again, aren't we?""
I nod.
""Yep.""
""Other people fight over infidelity or bad sex, but not us. We fight over a stupid game...""
""correction. you fight over a stupid game.""
""I do, don't I?""
We laugh like possesed idiots.
""I say we turn the game off."" He says.
""Why?""
""Well, we just had a fight. Doesn't that entitle us to make up?"" He looks at me with those eyes that I know mean something naughty.
I press the logout button. 
""I'm still mad at you."" I say with a smile. But we both know what's coming after that...

"event","I, for one, feel that tonight, under the heavy rain and dreary atmosphere is perhaps a great time to tell stories. Perhaps one about myself is in order. 

  I am a killer. One without mercy, unfeeling of any pain. Perhaps a monster, if you so wish to consider me so. My kind is no longer appreciated, nor has it ever been. I am an assasin for hire and tonight is merely another assignment. Nothing different, nothing new.

  My assignment is simple. Go to a house, to the second floor and quietly and effectively kill the person there named Aaron McLeannan. I am to go with a partner. A sadistic murderer with disturbing trends. His name is Demetrious. And believe me, this is a name worthy of fear. 

  So tonight, here we are. Demetrious and myself standing in front of the two-story house, under the thundering rain dressed in our tight-fitting suits with our weapons of choice. A dagger and small katana for myself and the light staff for him.

""Are you afraid, Bleuryder? - He says to me, noticing that I had hesitated about making a move.

Unafraid, Indifferent, I answered. 

""Never.""

   We make our move. With incredible expertise we sneak into the house. No sounds could be heard, as we took every precaution possible. We were quick. We were effective, as only those who are in our trade are. Demetrious kept a lookout while I realeased from a small container a powerful gas that made everyone who was human sleep deeply. When I gave him the signal we both ran silently upstairs to the room where our target supposedly lay. 

   To our surprise, he wasn't there. 

""What now?"" - I asked Demetrious.

""We cannot leave wihout finishing off our target. Look for him"" - He instructed.

   But we did not have to look. For when we turned around we saw a small child standing in the doorway. He was around nine years old with piercing blue eyes and short black hair. 

""Who are you?""

""Are you Aaron McLeannan?"" - I asked him immediately, but I knew it was useless because he was awake. Only people who weren't human could have been awake.

The child nodded. And this was his mistake. Before he could even think, Demetrious grabbed him by his neck and covered his mouth. 

""Then it is your turn to die, little boy."" - He hissed into the terrified boy's ear. Without thinking he pushed the boy face down on his bed, all the while maintaining his grip on him while he withdrew his staff. 

""You're a pretty one, aren't you?""- Demetrious hissed. I knew what he was going to do now.

""Demetrious, we do not have all night. Don't do this."" 
  I looked at the boy's terrified face. I knew what Demetrious was going to do.

""Mind you own bussiness Bleuryder. Go downstairs and make sure none of the other people sleeping hear us."" - He grinned as he saw the boy's face. I saw him caress his neck rather gently. - ""I want some alone time with this one. But you are welcomed to join us if you're interested.""

  Even though I knew what he was going to do, I decided not to stay. It would be too much to handle. Instead I went downstairs and kept a lookout as I heard the screams from the boy's room. I knew Demetrious was torturing the boy in many ways. Humiliating him until he begged for death.  When everything fell silent, about an hour later, I decided to go upstairs again. 

  The sight disturbed me. But I was also felt no remorse for what I saw. The boy was kneeling on the floor, crying. His clothes were ripped, he was beaten senseless and blood was everywhere in the room. The minute he saw he crawled up to me.
 
""Please sir, help me...I don't want to die."" - He begged amidst tears. 

I did nothing. His words did not reach me at. I merely stared at him, like an emotionless statue.

""Do you really want to live in this humiliation?"" - Demetrious asked him. 

The boy didn't answer. He was petrified of Demetrious. I looked at the boy, who was crying in pain and fear and decided that no one should have to live this way. Before Demetrious could torture the boy more, I took out my dagger and in one swift motion I slit the boy's throat, killing him instantly.

""Forgive me, boy. I ended your life, but at least I showed you mercy.""

""I thought you didn't care, Bleuryder."" - Demetrious mocked. - ""Are you growing a conscience?"" 

  Without answering, I took out my katana and with one stroke, it went through Demtrious' chest. Shocked at my action and the fact that he was dying, he gasped his last word.

""Why...?""

""I am not a monster Demetrious. Even though I don't care what happens to you.""

   I left without looking back. I still feel no remorse for my actions. Yet I still hope that boy found peace in his final moments. He probably did while I still continue to live in this eternal disgrace.

Why is it that whanever you think life is going good for you it somehow has a way of backfiring at you? Honestly, people just really stop caring about life altogether whenever they're not appreciated. It makes you want to think what exactly is your purpose in life. 

Is one supposed to live for love? For family? For passions? I don't know. I've yet to find an answer.

"event","Hello again! Seeing as I will post short stories about this particular character I thought a little background might be in order.

Bleuryder Lockemoer is the youngest of the faerie race known as Ice Ondines (yes I know its a sucky name). The particularity about this race is the fact that they are not born as children, but rather carved from a particular sort of magical ice found only in the dreamrealms. Only a few were ever made (like ten) and their breeding with with other races has made them able to breed normally, without having to carve more statue-like people. Bleu is the only pureblood reportedly left, but only because his twin brother faked his death. Their job and reason of living was to protect the royal family, particularly the current king and prince. If they failed to submit to this, their gift of immortality and magic would end at once.

Bleuryder was shunned since he was made because he was not as skilled in magic as his twin brother Shane. Discarded and forgotten while his brother rose throught the ranks at phoenix castle,Bleu submitted himself to the court of Shadows, becoming a first class assasin, in no time flat. However, his reluctance to kill made the organization angry and forced a power hungry demon to inhabit his body, making him the worst killer ever reported in faerie history under the alias of Evan Bleu.

Of course time passed, and when the kingdom was in their greatest need, four heroes rose to the occasion: Aragannon Leif-Lennor Macleannan (the high king), Zen ""Firespirit"" Lawrence (werewolf warrior), Shane Lockemoer (warlock and and bodyguard to the king) and Bleuryder. He was captured by Shane and the demon forcefully exorcised from his mind and soul. However this forced a partcicular curse on him, as well as an eternal weakness to mind intrusion and manipulation.

Now playing for the good side, Bleuryder is the personal bodyguard to Aragannon as well as spy/treasure retriever/ninja. He is still quite versed in the many arts of killing as well as a topnotch gymnast with superhuman speed.

*ed. note- I came up with his concept during my anime/comic books/videogames are god stage in my life. WHile many more cliches are available in book, please keep in mind that I started writing about Bleu in tenth grade. Please bear with me. Many more detils, like his looks and curse, only available in future posts!"

Well, hello. To those who are not in friend list, You may call me Bleu,though when you read my stuff you'll notice it doesn't really match my gender (girl in real life, boy in book.). 

If you're into fantasy, (videogames or otherwise) feel free to read my stuff, even though sometimes it won't make any sense. I like questions, comments and constructive criticism in my books or articles, so as long as you're not insulting, feel free to ask.

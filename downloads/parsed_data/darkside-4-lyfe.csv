"event","Oh my shit.  Haven't updated this in a long time.  I actually forgot about it.  Well today I went and bought me a backpack.  It's grey and raggedy looking, with a red health cross on it.  It looks like some damn health pack from a video game or something.  It's pretty rad.  I also bought some Garnier Fructis styling paste, so it better be worth a shit.  I want to see Sky High tonight, it looks pretty lame/cool all at the same time.  K well anyways, I'm gone.  Peace."

Well I didn't get to finish Star Wars Episode IV last night.  My dad got interested in ""Man On Fire"" and didn't go to bed til like 1:45.  So at 3 am I was like ""ok i need to go to bed, i'll finish it later.""  Woo the Hayden christensen episode of Jay Leno is on tonight.  Wee!  It's a repeat...but still....it's hayden.  Haha.

"event","Ugh my computer crashed yesterday and we lost ERRTHING.  We had to reinstall windows xp, then aol.  I still haven't reinstalled microsoft word and all that other stuff.  So right now all we have on the computer is windows xp, aol, and aim.  And some other useless junk.  Ugh tomorrow I have to get up at like 10 am and clean the house because we have air condition folk coming over.  Then I might have to go w/my sis to the doctor incase my mom can't go.  If not, then me and monica might go thrifting.  Value World = Half Off.  I got my shirt the other day for like $1.62, it was originally $2.99.  Hell yeah for a bargain!  My new desktop wallpaper totally owns.

I rented Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope today.  (The original first one from 1977).  I have never seen any of the original ones.  So I have now seen Episodes 1-3, so I now need to start on 4-6.  I'm now waiting on my parental units to go to bed so I can watch it on the big screen telly.  Well imma go listen to the rest of the Muse cd."

"event","I bought the Muse cd ""Absolution"" today at Circuit City.  It is friggin good.  Circuit City's cd's are on sale for $9.99 (regularly 10.99-13.99).  Then I went and bought a shirt at Value World Thrift (omg all their shit is half off moni!) to match my board shorts so I can go swimming, once the damn weather clears up.  My board shorts I bought are friggin awesome.  They are black, with like a white stripe diagonally down the side of them with a lime green border and then a lime green stripe across the butt and up to the waist.  You'd have to see them, they are hard to explain.  Circuit City also had the Episode III soundtrack, with like 1 copy left.  I bet Andrew ""Minty"" hit that shit up."

"event","Ok I totally love Coldplay now.  Ugh I wish I could assasinate Green Day, but if I did, it would only make them ""legends"", and all the media would play their music, EVEN MORE, than what they do already.  Speaking of the media, it boggles (haha where'd that come from?) me when there is a ""controversial"" video/song/commercial/etc. surfacing, and nobody want's it shown or whatever, but the media plays it 24/7 to people because it's such a controversy.  Hello folk!  You are defeating your whole purpose, get some sense in your noggin.  Sorry, I just watched the new ""controversial paris commercial"" with the cheeseburger.  People need to get a life and stop being so jealous that they aren't as skinny and hot as her.  Just because all these uppercrust white women are mad because they got coochie cobwebs don't mean Paris has got to be celibate.  Anyways, enough ranting, today was boring, I slept til like 2 pm, then woke up and watched ""Are We There Yet?"", it was pretty good, for a Ice Cube comedy.  Well time to part ways with ya....peace outtie."

"event","Well Carrie won.  =(.  Oh well, I loved both of em, and Bo is basically going to get a contract anyways cuz Clive Davis basically offered him one.  Hell he needs to just become the new lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd and they should just tour and make a comeback and shite.  How awesome would that be?  I think I am gonna go with my mom to Idols Live, their concert.  Today me and moni-o (haha, copier!) went to el Six Flags.  OMG FAGS INN!!! Haha.  We rode some shit, then they started closing some rides because it was overcast and then started raining, so we drive all over arlington lookin for somewhere to eat cuz we didn't really wan't Steak N Shake...again.  We finally find an IHOP, and realize we're all the way in damn Grand Prairie.  Haha fucking arlington needs some signs of where some eating places are besides ""Frijolas"" and ""On the Border"" and ""Trail Dust"".  So then we go back and ride the rest of the rides.  Mr. Freeze is totally my new favorite ride now.  Well I need to run now before my computer fucks up again and a damn pop-up comes up and blocks errthing and i can't see shit, and plus I need to take a shower cuz being at six flags all day makes you pretty rank.  Peace, ""Mo Love!"".  Haha, inside jokes make me tinkle."

"event","Yeah so this is my 3rd LJ username.  (Incufreak was my first, Drumminpunk was my 2nd, both loser-iffic names).  I like this username because I love Hayden AND Episode III, but I am not one of those actual stereotypical star wars fans, hell I have never even seen the original 3 movies, and i've only seen part of episode 2, and don't even really remember most of episode 1.  But episode III is awesome because the of the rise of the dark side.  Oh yeah!  I'm so evil.  Anyways, my layout turned out pretty bad ass, but I need a new icon because the quote on this one is wrong.  It's supposed to be ""I dreamed of absolute power"".  (I think).  Anyways I went to Target today and bought a Guinness (the beer) ballcap.  It's pretty ""tight"".....do folk even say that anymore?  K well anyways, I really need some friends on here, so yeah add me please, or I can add you.  Whatever.  I hope I don't come across any ""l337"" assholes on here.  K well anyways, gonna run now.  Bye!"

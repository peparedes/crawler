These are long-term relationships. People leave, people come back, but these separations are without the breach of intimacy. We are bonded not by blood or place, but by a similar morality; the need to live fully and for the moment, a disbelief in the future, a similar respect for honesty, a need to push limits, and a common history. We live life without consideration, but with consideration. There is among us an ability to listen and to empathize that surpasses the normal definition of friendship.""

<blockquote>There was once a duck. This duck was called Bonnie Flower-Cake. Bonnie Flower-Cake used to play around in the backgardens of strangers, and leave messages on lillypads. She was very lonely and would roam from place to place in hopes of finding someone who would be her friend. She wanted someone who would listen and talk to her and bake cookies with her. Instead, in every garden she went into, she only found evil grasshoppers who left around mushrooms and turnips. One day Bonnie Flower-Cake got so sick and tired of being mistreated, she left bombs in every garden and stole all the toads. The end.</blockquote>

"event","<blockquote><div align=justify>""If you heard your lover scream in the next room, and you ran in and saw his pinkie on the floor in a small puddle of blood, you wouldn't rush to the pinkie and say, <i>darling, are you okay?</i> No, you'd wrap your arms around his shoulders and worry about the pinkie later. The same holds true if you heard the scream, ran in, and saw his hand, or, God forbid, his whole arm. But suppose you hear your lover scream in the next room, and you run in, and his head is on the floor, next to his body, which do you rush to and comfort first?""

"event","<blockquote><div align=justify>""Every one of us is losing something precious to us,"" he says after the phone stops ringing. ""Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back again. That's part of what it means to be alive. But inside our heads - at least that's where I imagine it - there's a little room where we store those memories. A room like the stacks in this library. And to understand the workings of our own heart we have to keep on making new reference cards. We have to dust things off every once in a while, let in fresh air, change the water in the flower vases. In other words, you'll live for ever in your own private library.""

Things to remember:

- My brother asking me if I had fallen out with T.
- My mother asking me if I remembered my best friend from when I was two-three-four.

(my family surprise me in the best ways sometimes)

<blockquote>Andrew: ""You know that point in your life when you realize that the house that you grew up in isn't really your home anymore? All of the sudden even though you have some place where you can put your stuff that idea of home is gone.  ""
Sam: ""I still feel at home in my house.""
Andrew: ""You'll see when you move out, it just sort of happens one day one day and it's just gone. And you can never get it back. It's like you get homesick for a place that doesn't exist. I mean it's like this rite of passage, you know. You won't have this feeling again until you create a new idea of home for yourself, you know, for you kids, for the family you start, it's like a cycle or something. I miss the idea of it. Maybe that's all family really is. A group of people who miss the same imaginary place.""<blockquote>

"event","It's Christmas time and Winter time and nearly 2006 time and I'm-broke-from-buying-all-my-friends-presents time. And everything is, uh, good? Yes, good. I have a teeny, tiny, pinch-me-quick kind of cold that makes my right eye shrivel with tears, impairs my sense of smell (good thing too 'cause my mum is cooking), and forces my body to sleep right through to the afternoon's fingertips. My christmas-break has kind of been dull and boring and annoying so far. It started last Tuesday, but I've been off for like two weeks because I couldn't be bothered with college. I probably won't see my friends for another week because they'll be busy with their family and their celebrating, and I'll be here not celebrating and not exactly with my family because my mum will be working on Christmas day, as per usual. I've been happy, though! I've received lots of Christmas cards and presents and that makes me feel like I'm made of candy-floss and sugar and fairy-dust. Everything is beautiful."

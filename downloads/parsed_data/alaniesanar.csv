"event","I wrote this for one of my creative writing classes in college. I liked it a lot and I&#39;ve started on a sequel as well as my current WIP fan fiction.

TRIGGER

The blood is leaking out of my mouth now. I can&rsquo;t focus my eyes for a second, then I concentrate and the room comes back into focus. Including my view of Steve. He grins at me as I spit a glob of blood and saliva to the side. I give him a glare. &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;m just doing my job,&rdquo; he says holding his hands up in defense. He swings at me again and I hear my nose crack and break against his brass knuckles. My head swims and my vision blurs again.

The other guy sitting on the crate shifts around. &ldquo;Quit screwin&rsquo; around and kill the bitch, would ya?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s obviously uncomfortable. I think he&rsquo;s called Ricky. He lights a cigarette and takes a deep drag. I watch the smoke swirl before I realize that Steve had taunted me again.

&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I choke out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I said, do you want me to snap your neck or shoot you in the head?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Um&hellip;.&rdquo; I take a moment to consider this. Shot to the head is the most reliable, but it leaves a weird hole in your head. Excuse me for wanting to leave a nice looking corpse. Neck snap is pretty, but there&rsquo;s a chance it won&rsquo;t kill me. I could lie there and suffocate because he broke my trachea, but not my spine. Well, I&rsquo;m not going to die anyway.

With that thought, I strained my arms against the ropes I had been wearing down with a hidden razor blade, and they snapped apart. Rope went flying and Steve&rsquo;s eyes went wide. Ricky hasn&rsquo;t noticed yet. &ldquo;Holy Shi-&quot; Steve doesn&rsquo;t get to finish because my leg swings around knock him over. He falls and his head hits the cement floor with a loud crack.

Ricky has definitely noticed now. His ciggy has fallen out his mouth and to the floor. I dive forward to Steve&rsquo;s body, where his head has started to form a small puddle of blood on the ground. I snatch at his 9mm and I hear Ricky jump off the crate. I roll onto my side and aim the gun at Ricky&rsquo;s chest before he gets his all the way out of his holster. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo;

He freezes and his hands shoot up into the air. His eyes are wide and I can see his knees shaking in my peripheral vision. &nbsp;I smirk a bit and sit up. &ldquo;Thanks. Now, I need you to you to take of your jacket, then your holster and toss them both over there. Slowly.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Please, god! I&rsquo;ll tell you, just don&rsquo;t shoot me!&rdquo;

&ldquo;Just follow instructions and you&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; I lie.

He starts to take off his jacket and I get my first good look at him. He can&rsquo;t be more than 19. The others guys I overheard before I got caught were talking about a newbie. Must be Ricky here. Stupid kids, couldn&rsquo;t he have just gone to trade school or something? I hate killing kids like this. He was taking off his holster now.

&ldquo;Good and toss it,&rdquo; I say nodding in the opposite direction of Steve. He tosses it over with a loud clack. &ldquo;Now, your entire stock of weapons is here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I ask as I stand slowly. He looks so scared.

He practically whimpers, &ldquo;Y-yeah, it&rsquo;s all h-here. I heard them talking ab-bout it. Now, please, let me go!&rdquo;

&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; I say and pull the trigger. The bullet hit him between the eyes and I see the back of his head land on the floor before the rest of his body does. He looked so scared. His eyes all wide, and his mouth hanging open. Why do kids like him get involved in these crime families? Probably the same reasons as usual. Bad parents, abuse, over-rebelliousness, etc. It&rsquo;s so sad.

I feel something odd on my cheek. I put a hand up to it and look at my hand. Water? There&rsquo;s no holes on the ceiling and it&rsquo;s not raining. Wher- I shake my head of the thought and start dragging Steve between the crates of the storehouse. Ricky&rsquo;s next. When I go to grab him, his face calls my attention to it again. It&rsquo;s so calm compared to before. He just looks like he&rsquo;s sleeping. How did he manage that? I shake my thoughts off again and get him hidden with Steve. I pull my multi-tool out of my pack and open up the pliers part.&nbsp; Opening up Ricky&rsquo;s bloody mouth, I fix the pliers around his top left incisor. With a quick yank and twist, it pops free. I drop it into a plastic bag and start on the rest.

Once done pulling Ricky and Steve&rsquo;s teeth, I toss the bloody bag of teeth into my pack and pull out a small bottle of concentrated gasoline jelly. I spread some on Steve and Ricky, and then throw some packing hay on top of them. I position the lid of a wooden crate so it leads from their bodies to the crates next to them. Smearing, the jelly on the lid, I make sure that the fire will spread quickly and create confusion. That way, I can get out of here easily. I find my matches and strike one. Ricky&rsquo;s stupid, scared face flashes through my mind again and I throw the match onto the packing hay. It catches quickly and the power of the flame doubles when it reaches the flammable jelly.

Soon, I find myself sitting on the wall of the compound watching people come out of the buildings surrounding the burning storehouse wondering what the hell is going on. I save that image for later and drop down the outside of the wall. Sticking my hands in my pockets, I walk calmly down the street towards the car I parked in the alleyway. The streets are empty, but they won&rsquo;t be soon. Lookey-loos enjoying the firemen and paramedics saving the criminals inside. The dusty red corolla is where I left it and I climb in. I let out a long sigh and zone out at the steering wheel.

This is getting old. The infiltrating, the interrogations, the killing, the escaping&hellip;Too old. Killing kids who are in the wrong place at the wrong time because of wrong decisions is just &ndash;for lack of a better word- wrong. I&rsquo;ve been doing this for 11 years and it hasn&rsquo;t bothered me before. Why is this one assignment getting to me? Probably because it was such a dumb assignment. Revenge against this crime family for stealing a contract with an arms dealer. There were tons of other deals we could have taken. Better ones. But no, the Boss had to be stubborn and territorial beyond reason and send me in to destroy their arms supply and who knows what else. Petty arguments causing the deaths of dumb kids who don&rsquo;t know any better.

I turn the key in the ignition and start on my way to the Office. I&rsquo;m not looking forward to it. The Boss has been on a downward spiral for the last couple of years. He&rsquo;s been drinking and his decisions have been getting stupid. He&rsquo;s even started to think he might get me in bed by strutting his power around me. Right.

My Corolla chugs down the freeway until I reach my exit, pulling off, I think about other assignments I&rsquo;ve had. Especially in the beginning, they had more meaning and purpose. The Boss chose the jobs carefully and they, of course had monetary value, but no pointless killing of small time criminals because they annoyed him. It&rsquo;s become ridiculous.

I pull up in front of the Office. It seems normal on the outside. Eight stories, typical modern glass and steel architecture, hidden underground floors. Well, the hidden underground floors aren&rsquo;t exactly normal. After parking, I pick up my pack and head to the top floor. In the elevator, Ricky&rsquo;s frightened face sneaks into my brain again. I frown and my thoughts go back to the Boss&rsquo;s face. His thin face with the sunken in, eyes red from last night&rsquo;s drinking. The ding of the elevator doors pull me out of my reverie.

The floor looks normal. Beth, the secretary looks up at me. She gives me a sad half smile from her sad little desk. All of sudden, I can&rsquo;t hold back the memories anymore. &nbsp;The faces of all the dumb kids, seasoned veterans, unsuspecting bystanders and horrible hit men flood into my head. All the emotions I&rsquo;ve always buried flash through my heart and I feel my legs shake. Beth looks confused as the elevator doors shut. I hear the whooshing sound as they close and I lean back against the wall of the elevator. Another strange feeling on my cheek again. Without thinking I put my hand to it and look at my wet fingers. Water. No, not water. Tears&hellip;Tears? I&rsquo;m crying? I haven&rsquo;t cried since&hellip;my first assignment.

It hit me then. What is this job doing? I was doing something once. I gave up my emotion so I could help the Boss do what he needed to. I believed in him. But he&rsquo;s slipped. The assignments have slipped. I have no reason to cage in these emotions any more. It&rsquo;s not worth it. I punch the lobby button on the elevator and I feel the elevator descend. That&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m not doing this anymore. Screw it. I know the Boss&rsquo;ll send people after me, but I&rsquo;m the best operative he has. He won&rsquo;t get me. I don&rsquo;t belong to the Company any more."

"event","I&#39;ve never been too much of a writer. I wonder if I don&#39;t write much because I doubt my abilities. Am I a good writer? Am I as clever as I think I am? Who knows?

I wonder if I should write fanfiction, since I&#39;m such a hugely obsessive nerd. I started reading fanfiction when I was 19 (I&#39;m 25 now). I&#39;ve written a few short stories and vignettes, even a Naruto fanfiction. It was only a one-off that was originally going to be a multi-chapter. I&#39;m in the middle of writing a sequel to one of my short stories. I&#39;m still wondering if the original was any good. It was never one I got much feedback on.
I suppose that just writing and reading recreationally in any capacity will help me improve. Now I&#39;ve posted on spn_betas that I&#39;m available as a beta reader. So, there&#39;s another activity that will help me. I guess I just need to remember that there&#39;s no external pressure and that it&#39;s ok to just write random stuff and it doesn&#39;t have to be brilliant or super long.

I gotta keep that in mind."

I can be a bit oblivious sometimes.

Sometimes I get a kick out of making people uncomfortable sometimes. It's bad, I know, but sometimes people need to venture out of their comfort zones. I can be pushy. That's usually only people I don't give a fuck about or I'm very comfortable with. I can be terribly blunt about it too. &quot;Yeah, I think you're running away from your issues. Talk to me about it.&quot; I'm not into subtle. That can make things awkward, being blunt about sensitive issues.

"event","I get a lot of my ideas for my blogs from my conversations with my friends. My friends just happen to be people with interesting ideas and observations when it comes to life, the universe and everything (42). That's what I love about my friends. They make me think about anything and everything. <br /><br />Specifically, I was talking about with one such compatriate about their feeling of lacking passion in their life. They missed it and wanted it back, but were not sure when and where to find it.<br /><br />Passion seems to be a pretty rare thing; be it for another person, an idea, a country, a career or an interest. Most of the population settles for what keeps them satisfied and brings food to the table. It can be tiring holding out for passion. Waiting for that one thing that makes you, individually happy and inspired. That's why people settle for things that seem to make other people happy and satisfies them. The drive to truly work for that level of happiness and passion is not easy to keep going.<br /><br />I know I falter sometimes.<br /><br />So what am I passionate about? I have some ideas. I think I need to explore them more.<br />-<i>Animation</i>: Nothing gets me going more than a piece of high quality animation. I will watch animated movie with bad stories just because the animation is so cool (Titan A.E.! Ahh, Don Bluth).<br />-<i>Visual Art</i>: I tend to freak out when I find a piece of art really does something to me. It moves me and makes me want to be better artist. Creating art does a lot for me in theraputic sense and it helps my ego sometimes too.<br />-<i>Those I love and care about:</i> This might be the biggest of the three. I feel great importance when it comes to being a good friend and it disturbs me greatly when I'm not. I feel guilt still about a lot of things where I feel like I've wronged someone. I bothers me the most. One of my main goals in life is to be a dependable person that my friends and family can go to for comfort, advice and help.<br /><br />I've been, so far, unsuccesful at becoming the person I want to be: Successful, independant, strong and caring. I let things get in the way and I've &quot;fallen behind&quot; as it were. I almost gave up completly once. <br /><br />I'm not going to give up. I know what I want in very general, non-specific terms. I'm not sure what my goal for&nbsp; career or even my personal life is specifically; marriage? Kids? Animator? Psych? Etc.<br /><br />Either way, it's always more about the journey of finding your passion than actually finding it. Keep exploring things that interest you, and trying nw things. You'll find a passion and you'll need drive to get there. <br /><br />*end preaching here*"

I avoided the situation while I thought about things and dealt with other things in my life. I'm on a medication for Depression now and it seems to be doing good for me so far, despite making me even more susceptible to the effects of alcohol.&nbsp;<br /><br />Even longer than the past two months, I've been neglecting some of my friendships; flailing in my lack knowledge on how to handle the bumps in the relationships. I've never been good with re-kindling things. If something goes south, my first instinct is to just drop it and try something else. However, people are not School Projects. Duh, Renee. Duh. So, I'm going to try to pay attention to my friends more, even if it's just sending them random texts that say &quot;Meow&quot; in them. I was being kind of selfish, not wanting to deal with other people's problems. Sorry.<br /><br />Update:<br />In other news, This quarter at school seems to be going okay so far. I haven't fallen behind yet and I like my Philosophy class a lot. I'm more proactive and I think it might be rubbing off on people. Weee!&nbsp;I've been reading a lot more too. This is great, because I think it makes my brain work more and I just feel smarter lately. When i was depressed, i turned into a gelatinous mass of laziness and self-doubt. I've ordered some books off of Amazon and I've been reading the Sookie Stackhouse series by Charlaine Harris.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not trying to be conceited either, but I've recently been looking in the mirror and saying to myself, &quot;Not bad. Not bad at all.&quot; Which is nice. Every girl wants to feel attractive, and I've been feeling good about that lately. (I've also been getting a lot of complements on my ass, MUAHAHAHA!*brags shamelessly*) <br /><br />Here's a nice pic from My Spring Break too, This was taken on the Angel's Landing tail in Zion National Park, Utah.

If we're too heavy, not girly enough, aren't pretty enough or aren't well groomed enough, guys write us off and look for the hotter girl. XP It's seriously materialistic and shallow. Guys lust after porn stars and models and actresses and that's the standard. it makes us feel like crap, being compared like that. We don't like looking like porn stars or acting like them.

I actually did not make myself talk to him face to face like I had originally planned. As soon as he walked out the door, I regretted not doing it and I panicked. I called him and In a weird, confusing way, I think I got my point across. He told me that he didn't feel anything for me other than platonic affection. He likes me, but not as anything more than a friend. I told him that I think it's time we ended the physical side of our relationship then. He was agreeable.

I don't think I could handle continuing to sleep with/fool around with a guy I have thing for and try to be emotionally unattached. Too hard, too risky.&nbsp;I can handle just being friends. This would be nice. He's a wonderful friend and has helped me with a lot of things and he even continues to offer me support even though I brought this awkwardness down on him.

"event","<!--- blog subject ---> 								                                 <!--- blog body ---> 								 Okay, before anyone gets up in arms, I'm fully for equal treatment respect between the sexes. I have pretty unique views when it comes to gender roles and traditional preconceptions. I don't believe one gender is better than the other, more intelligent, more worthy. Men and women are different. They compliment each other.

So when I say feminists are weird, I don't mean that feminism is weird. I'm mainly referring to the types of feminists that write plays like, &quot;The Vagina Monologues.&quot; That was odd. Throughout the play, there is a strong metaphor between vaginas and women. A lot of these women used their vaginas as symbols for themselves. This is fine, but they brought up some odd issues. Like tampons. One woman treated tampons like a form of torture. Another woman blamed her husband for pain because he wanted her to shave her vagina. She could have said &quot;No.&quot;

Yes, vaginas have endured horrible things over time merely because they are women. They covered these things too; rape, abuse, discrimination, female circumcision. However, I don't think it's right to put tampons and shaving on the same level. Those things are optional and easily controlled. Don't complain. I don't care if your vagina is angry, I'm annoyed and have feet to kick your vagina with.

I prefer not to identify myself as a vagina. When a list of adjective describing me comes up, &quot;owner of a beautiful vagina&quot; will never come up (that part of the play was ridiculous). If you feel the need to pay more attention your femininity, do that. You don't have to look at your vagina to do it. You don't have to masturbate to do it (at least, I didn't). Femininity is more than your vagina and the orgasms you have. It's a feeling, an aura, something not as easy to pin down. It's more ethereal than a vagina.

One is not one's vagina.

"event","&nbsp;So I've had a pretty miserable week because of my own bodily functions and the fact that it's the wrong time of the month. Suffice to say that I've been tired, irritable and possibly the laziest woman on earth. I'm feeling a bit better today. No headache and enough sleep can do you a world of good.

So I've got my plans for this weekend up and running. Ellen's B-day party tonight, hopefully a ride home tomorrow or late tonight. Roleplaying session on Sunday and a trip back to the dorm for more fun and games.

I'm thinking about applying for an art school. Otis or Maybe the art center in Pasadena. I need to look up more options, but Otis is a lot closer to home. I love my art classes. &nbsp;I really do. I feel like I'm getting more accomplished in those classes than the others. I keep getting very frustrated with my other classes. Math feels like a joke most of the time and Art History I can kinda understand why it's required, but the importance level seems very over inflated.&nbsp;

Most art school require a reasonable amount of studio art class credits for a transfer students. There is the option of applying as a freshman and transferring what credits I do have though. Or I can stick around here for a bit longer and build up some credits here. there's also summer classes at El Co and things like that. So many options, so little time. Hmmm. I'll make a decision soon. After more research.

By the way, take a look at my deviant Art. http://alaniesanar.deviantart.com"

&quot;Lucida Grande&quot;"">I recently had to shut someone out of my life who used to and still means a lot to me. We have a long complicated history together and it hurt when I finally had to say &quot;no more&quot; to him. We used to be crazy about each other. We went everywhere together and helped each other through some really hard stuff. He was my first boyfriend and I still value the time we had together a lot. He affected me greatly. When we broke up, it was after almost two years and it was mutual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Lucida Grande&quot;"">After that, we were friends. We talked online, but we kept venturing back into the physical side of things. This made it hard for me to let go of him. He started doing some things that turned me off and we talked less and less.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes"">&nbsp; </span>The next couple of times I saw him, we almost went back to being in a sexual relationship, but I put a stop to it. It had complicated things last time and I didn&rsquo;t want to do it again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Lucida Grande&quot;"">I&rsquo;ve dated a couple guys since him. One of them has lasted longer than a month (neat!), and I feel like I&rsquo;ve moved on. However, My ex called me again needing emotional support, saying he missed me and still wanted to be friends. At first I thought this was okay. Then I realized how uncomfortable the idea of being alone with him made me. So, I told him I wanted to keep it just on the phone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Lucida Grande&quot;"">Then, the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back came along in the form of emotionally desperate 4am phone calls. Normally, I&rsquo;d answer the phone at 4am with no qualms.

&quot;Lucida Grande&quot;"">I feel guilty that all the time and work I put into our relationship had to end this way. Every now and then I stare at my phone and wonder if I should try to talk to him again. Maybe I can help him. Maybe he only needs to talk.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes"">&nbsp; </span>Then again, maybe he&rsquo;ll want to see me and he&rsquo;ll ask for things I can&rsquo;t give him. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have to turn him away eventually anyway.

I had been hearing stuff about this Anime ranging from rave reviews to jokes about the title (&quot;Elfen Layed&quot; Get it? Someone got layed? No?). I've been out of the Anime thing for a while except for my weekly doses of Naruto and Bleach (Except this week! AUGH). My trip back into the Anime world was abit dissappointing.<br /><br />Elfen Layed is best known for it's graphic goreyness and nudity. Yes, it has plenty of that. Heads, limbs and boobies everywhere. The story was a might&nbsp; bit predictable though. It was obvious from the beginning that Kohta had repressed memories, that they were about Lucy/Nyu, and that she was in love with him. I did like that they were brave enough to kill off the main character and that the whole thing did not have a happy ending (I'm not counting the teaser thing at the end). <br /><br />It seems that most anime always goes back to a few basic things: Awkward sexual tension, overly jealous/shy females, childhood trauma, and very depressed teenagers. There are others, but these apply to Elfen Lied.&nbsp; I'm getting tired of it. I like a romance as much as the next person, but if you're going to do romance, do it right. Don't make it childish and dumb. Also, why is childhood trauma the explination for almost every personality flaw an anime character has? can't people just be dumb jerks? I certainly know some. <br /><br />Grrr.&nbsp; This is evil. I love animation. I went to anime originally because I could watch one of my favorite art forms and it wasn't just exclusively for little kids. However, if it starts getting redundant, I'll be very angry."

A LOT. It's part of my anxiety problem. There's always something that I'm freaking out over illogically. If it's not school, then it's my friends. If it's not my friends, then it's work. If it's not work, then it's my family. It's bad. My brain pumps chemicals or something into my body that tell me, &quot;you are worried that none of your friends like you.&quot; Of course, I know that if my friends didn't like me, they wouldn't be IMing, texting and calling me. I know this. I admit, my friends and me don't always talk regularly, but they know I love them. So, I just take a moment to tell myself, &ldquo;This is just the result of chemicals in your brain. It&rsquo;s not real. It&rsquo;ll be gone soon.&rdquo; This has worked better than any medication I&rsquo;ve ever taken. I don&rsquo;t let it affect my life.<br /><br />In other news, the first week of school is over with and I survived it. I even got all my work done on time. You&rsquo;re saying, &ldquo;Wow, really?&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m responding with, &ldquo;Yes. Really.&rdquo; It took a couple nights of staying up till 1:30 or even 3:30am, but it&rsquo;s worth it to not have to worry about the damn grades.I&rsquo;m working on art stuff again. Not only for my drawing class, but just for fun too. I&rsquo;ve got a pretty spiffy Kakashi coloring job going and I did a psychedelic drawing in my art journal.I didn&rsquo;t get into the design class I wanted; it just didn&rsquo;t work out in time. I was #1 on the waiting list, but nobody else dropped the class, so I couldn&rsquo;t get in. I&rsquo;m taking Economics instead. The lecturer is pretty cool, amusing and everything. <br /><br />So everything was good the past week in terms of school and work. Personally it was pretty bad. I got some bad news from the doctor which has me worried, my brother was having romantic troubles and I miss my friends. Haha, I think I&rsquo;ve had time to get over it though. I feel better. So, here&rsquo;s to looking forward to next week!<br />A couple messages to those I&rsquo;ve been thinking of:<br />Kevin: Yaaay money! Thanks.<br />Ashley: Next weekend. YOU.<br />Daniel: Yaaay job!<br />Mantha: YOU. 21. HB.</p>"

"event","How do you tell your brother that it's almost certain that he is going to experience great emotional pain at the hands of a female very soon? Even if you warn him, he might not totally believe you. At least not until it actually hits him.

He asked me why girls are attracted to some men and not others. Was there ever a chance for the others? Could an attraction grow? I didn't know what to say to him. I knew he wanted facts, easily understood guidelines and reasons. However, I had to give him the truth.

There are no rules or logical reasons for being attracted to someone. We have our theories, but then we become attracted to the opposite of what we were before. They say that as soon a woman meets a man, she knows whether or not she'll sleep with him. I don't know if it's that fast, but it can be pretty quick. Maybe one or two meetings or conversations. Maybe longer. As for the third question--&quot;could an attraction grow?&quot;--that's a complete mystery. We hear stories about long time friends becoming lovers. Sometimes it works out. Sometimes it doesn't. 

I really don't know much about why people like or love other people. I can tell when they do and when they don't. I can theorize as to why, but they're only theories. 

There are few certainties when it comes to love though.
- Love is unpredictable. It can happen anywhere between any two people. Never say never.
- Being in love makes you vulnerable. As soon as you fall for someone, your heart is in their hands. This a truly frightening concept to some. I know it is to me.
- Love will hurt you someday. It's bound to happen. It's extremely rare for someone to meet &quot;the one&quot; early on, marry them and live happily with them the rest of their life. So, just know that it's got to happen sooner or later and you will survive.
- Real love will be worth it. If you find someone to love and spend your life with, it will be worth the failed relationships before that. You have to break a few eggs to make an omelet, or so they say. 

It's difficult. Some people never find the love of their lives. Some settle for good instead of great. Some find what they're looking for. Some come out scarred and emotionally jaded. Some come out happy and prosperous. I think it's best to try. Otherwise, you'll always be left wondering, &quot;What if...?&quot;"

Is it determination? Is it being impervious? Is fearlessness?&nbsp;<br />Anyone will argue that it is an important part of a person's character. People avoid being without it. Some strive for it all their lives and some never achieve it. Some achieve it out of necessity. Some people have it innately without even trying. The true meaning is hard to pin down, and yet we all know it when we see it.<br />Except when we look at ourselves. We are our own worst critics and the human ego knows no bounds. Quite the paradox. Personally, I'd like to leave this judgment up to someone else. I don't know if I could form an unbiased opinion.<br />I know strong people. I met a woman once who lived a nightmare life and never gave into the nightmare. She overcame and ended up with 2 daughters and a beautiful home despite abuse, drug addiction and a criminal husband. My mother sacrifices a lot in order to be there for her family, her generosity sometimes seems unending. I know more people that overcame bad circumstances and managed to find their little slice of happiness. Mostly, I think they all had a determination to keep going, despite fears and all manners of abuse.<br />So strength, in my opinion, is a combination of many things. It can be adapting to bad circumstances. It can be walking your own path. It can be fighting for what you love or believe in. Like I said, the true meaning is hard to pin down. Mostly this is because the meaning is different in every situation. Everyone has his or her own personal definition, think about it.</p></span>"

I also mentioned that I wanted by the time I went back to school on the 5th of Jan. There are hiccups in my plan. My funds are running out faster than I had expected, mostly because of going to eat with friends. I need to reign that in quickly.<br /><br />I currently have about $850 in my account. <br />Add the $800 coming on Dec. 16th and I'll have about $1600<br /><br />Depending on where I want to buy my mac, this could be problem. <br /><br />1) From Craigslist: I can find several people selling their Macbook Pros (2.4ghz, 120+g HD, 2g mem) for about $1200 to $1400. However, the idea of meeting some stranger in an unfamiliar place to buy a computer that may or may not be what they actually described in the ad is very unapealing. I should consider though, that these deals will not include tax and the price is often pree-set. <br /><br />2) MacMall: They're having a holday thing that's knocking the prices way down, but the deal is only lasting until the 15th. I get my paycheck on the 16th. The prices are are about $1300 for the new glossy one. Not sure about the non glossies. I'd have to work out some sort of delyaed payment thing somehow for that one.<br /><br />3) Other online stores: About the same as the online Apple store. Most macbooks (even the older generation ones) are up around $1800 to $2300. Ouch.<br /><br />My options:<br /><br />1)Man-up and buy a macbook pro off of someone on craigslist (or a similar site). I'd probably drag someone with me for support in case of crazy people (I can be a bit paranoid). Deal with any problems that arrise as they come to me.<br /><br />2) Try to buy from a local store such as mac mall and see what kind of deals I can arrange for myself. I might have to play the art student card and see if people will have pity on me. <br /><br />3) Wait until around mid-february for a couple more paychecks and therefore have more options in terms of shopping. If I waited until then, I could have around $2200 in my account. <br /><br />Now, to make a decision, I will need to consult with some people and do even more research. If you have any suggestions, ideas, thoughts, or help you wish to offer, feel free to do so. :]<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>  														 														 														 															 																<table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" border=""0"" class=""blogContentInfo""><tbody><tr valign=""top""><td><img border=""0"" src=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VCCCXD50L._SL75_.jpg"" alt="""" /></td> 																<td>Currently 																	 																		reading 																	: 																 																<br /><a onmouseout=""window.status='';return true;"" onmouseover=""window.status=unescape('The%20Key%20%28Guardians%20of%20Time%20Trilogy%29');return true;"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/Key-Guardians-Time-Trilogy/dp/1599900017?SubscriptionId=10YFNG2YAAQ0VTNNR4R2&amp;tag=myspace08-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=1599900017""><strong>The Key (Guardians of Time Trilogy)</strong></a> 																<br /> 																	By 																	Marianne Curley 																<br />Release date: 2006-10-03 																<img height=""1"" border=""0"" width=""1"" alt="""" src=""http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=myspace08-20&amp;l=xm2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1599900017"" /></td></tr></tbody></table><br />"

I've always had a minor thing for photography, but lately, with my interest in digital art growing, so has my need for a decent camera. I'm not talking anything professional like <a linkindex=""12"" href=""http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vd3d3Lm5pa29udXNhLmNvbS9GaW5kLVlvdXItTmlrb24vUHJvZHVjdC9EaWdpdGFsLVNMUi8yNTQ0Ni9EOTAuaHRtbA=="" target=""_self"">this, the D90</a>, or <a linkindex=""13"" href=""http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vd3d3Lm5pa29udXNhLmNvbS9GaW5kLVlvdXItTmlrb24vUHJvZHVjdC9EaWdpdGFsLVNMUi8yNTQ0Mi9EM1guaHRtbA=="" target=""_self"">or the $8000 Nikon</a> (holy shit btw).

Maybe not exactly this camera, but definitely something similar to it. A decent zoom (4x +), image stabilization, and a good low-light setting would be nice. *dreams* So, if I get that as a combination X-mas/birthday present, that would make me soooo happy. <br /><br />My Dell's DVD drive just died and I can't watch movies anymore. Also, it's getting slower and slower and starting to tax my patience.Yes, I'm going to buy a Macbook (preferrably a Macbook Pro). I'm not sure <span style=""font-style: italic;"">exactly</span> how much money I'll have to spare by the time rolls around, but I'm 95% sure that I'll have at least $1200 burning a hole in my pocket. With my student discount and/or some shopping around, I should be okay. I have a friend that knows some good places to go and I'm actually starting to get a bit excited about the new hardware I'm soon to own. I'll have a computer that can handle all my silly art programs, multitasking and can play DVD's! Yahoo!<br /><br />So, those are my two big Christmas wishes. One will be the most expensive thing I've ever bought (totally worth it though) and the other will be one of the best Christmas/birthday presents I might get (please?). <br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Ever since I almost watched this movie on Halloween, I've had the major urge to actually take the plunge and buy it and watch it.&nbsp; I didn't get around to it until now and I'm finally scratching the itch. 

&quot;You don't run. Now when you're with us. You stand your ground and you fight.&quot; ~Pete
Then a group of five of five guys take on a group of 20 and the ass kicking begins

That quote sets the mood for the entire movie. It's a movie about fighting for what you value, be it your reputation, your pride, your friends or your family. 

The main character is Matt Buckner, a journalism student from Harvard and he's recently been expelled because his rich roommate framed him for cocaine posession. Now, he's in London, England visiting his sister and her family. He runs into his brother in law, Pete, who is the leader of a football (soccer) firm called the Green Street Elite, aka the GSE. They're a kind of/sort of gang supporting the West Ham United football team. However, they're different from gangs like we find in America because they don't need any pussy ass guns or drive by shootings. 

The story is about Matt getting immersed into this football firm culture and learning that he's not made of glass and there are times to stand and fight and there are times to walk away. 

You'd think that this movie would appeal mainly to men, but since I saw it with my mom and Samantha in 2005, I've held a special place for it in my heart. I'm not sure if it's because of my strange fascination with English culture or because I've always been fascinated by people who could fight like they do in the movie. It's probably both. 

Either way, it's a movie that is truly awesome and unforgettable."

"event","The first One was Quantum of Solace, which I liked a lot. It was almost one continuous 2.5 hour action scene, but hey, I like action. And come ON, how could you watch the fight on scaffolding in Italy and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">not smile</span> when he got that final shot in while hanging upside down from a rope around his ankle? I mean, how cool it <span style=""font-style: italic;"">that? </span><br /><br />The story was thin in this movie, which isn't really surprising for a Bond flick. They connect it to Casino Royale in only a very obvious way and the plot progression was a bit clumsy. There weren't many twists and turns and the ones that were there could have been interchangeable with anything else. However it did have the true Bond spirit to it. Bond was suave, debonair and had the body of a male model. <br /><br />One interesting point though is that Bond did seduce one over-ambitious office worker, but did not bed the main Bond Girl. I think that added to emotional significance of his relationship with Vespar. Good job, wirters. <br /><br />-~-~-~-<br /><br />Then, per the request of a friend I watched a movie named &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;. Literally translated, it means &quot;the spirit of an age&quot; in German. Now, this one's a &quot;documentary&quot; of sorts. It's presented in three parts, each dealing with separate issues. The first part deals with organized religion and the theory that it, especially Christianity, is based on ancient sun worshiping religions. I agree with the movie here, Christianity and many other major modern religions are a jumble of many older pagan and polytheistic religions with an emphasis on the sun. <br /><br />However, this is almost common knowledge to anyone who decides to do some research or take a class on the religions of the past. The way these ideas are presented in the movie are a bit condescending, as if to say, &quot;Look! You've been duped, why didn't you see this before?&quot; It makes perfect sense to me though how people would not know or would not care about the origins of Christianity and just choose to believe it. <br /><br />The second part of the movie presented the ever-popular 9/11 conspiracy theories. Mainly the theory that the destruction of the World Trade Center by Terrorists was actually a US government controlled demolition in order to put the general populous in favor of invading Iraq. The evidence they present in the movie is circumstantial and anecdotal mainly. &quot;He said this&quot; and &quot;This looks like this&quot;. I believe that there are many things that the US government is hiding about 9/11, but I don't believe they planned it. I don't think our government is smart enough.<br /><br />The third part was the part that actually taught me some stuff I didn't know about banking. This part was about the Federal Reserve and the International Bankers. They presented more &quot;evidence&quot; to show that the international bankers are out to make us all their slaves and rule the world, essentially. I already knew this. We all know the heads of major corporations want to rule the world and make the peons do their bidding. However, it did present some things I think I will need to investigate. Like, apparently there is no law supporting income tax and income tax in unconstitutional. I'll have to look that one up.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie greatly. It made me think about things that I normally don't take the time to and it was good at evoking emotions even if it did do it through scare tactics (horror-ridden pictures of war and strocities). I think it is effective in it's effort to make people pay more attention to things that they normally wouldn't question. I reccommend it to anyone who can take it with a grain of salt and not change their world view just because of it. <br /><br />~-~-~-~<br /><br />Anyway, That's all for now. If you get the chance, see these movies and tell me what you think of them. If you disagree with something I said, go ahead and comment me, I always enjoy a good debate.<br /><br />I'll see you all randomly.<br />"

I feel bad because I feel that I lost control of my anxiety and let it take over. Sometimes, I worry about whether my relationships with my friends are healthy and whether or not I'm bothering them to no end. I know in my logical mind that I'm not, otherwise they would not call, IM or want to see me. <br /><br />I think I bothered one person in particular too much this weekend, but I know if I ask them about it, they'll tell me I didn't bother them. It doesn't make any sense, and I know that relying on other people for happiness will lead nowhere. I try to not go to my friends for help with emotional problems, but sometimes I have moments of weakness and I just want to be around people that I know care. I guess that's what you call support.<br /><br />So, I apologize to myself and whoever else I might have annoyed/bothered in the past few days. I did not mean to do that. <br /><br />I'll see you all randomly<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>  														 														 														 															 																<table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" border=""0"" class=""blogContentInfo""><tbody><tr valign=""top""><td><img border=""0"" src=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dMMoNQSBL._SL75_.jpg"" alt="""" /></td> 																<td>Currently 																	 																		reading 																	: 																 																<br /><a onmouseout=""window.status='';return true;"" onmouseover=""window.status=unescape('Star%20Wars%20Roleplaying%20Game%20Core%20Rulebook%2C%20Saga%20Edition');return true;"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Roleplaying-Game-Rulebook/dp/0786943564?SubscriptionId=10YFNG2YAAQ0VTNNR4R2&amp;tag=myspace08-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0786943564"" linkindex=""12"" set=""yes""><strong>Star Wars Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, Saga Edition</strong></a> 																<br /> 																	By 																	Owen K.C.

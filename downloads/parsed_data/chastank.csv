"event","Have you ever felt the need to kill people because they are butt munchers and they frustrate you.  Okay, here is how happened.  I was born, I went to school for 13 fuckin years and if that wasn't good enough they are now making me go for another 4 piss ant years and so the story will probably end with me killing those who have pressured me and then I will be free from this evil called life.  Thank you for reading Christine's story."

"event","Well, I have never done this whole ""live journal"" thing, but what the hell I will give it a shot.  Well, my roommate went home for the weekend and I don't know where in the hell she is because she still hasn't gotten back yet and she missed class.  Even though I can't stand her I still worry, which kinda sucks for me.  Well, I was late for class this morning because I was up extremely late talking to my friend Erin about our roommate problems so I am extremely tired right now.  That is all that I have to say at this moment at least."

"event","Well im getting ready for bed in a few minutes.  Just figured I would make a quick journal entry before I hit the sack.  Today was a pretty good day.  I didn't think that i would be able to see Ashley today and I ended up with no homework and nothing to do.  When i was at work she wemt to wal-mart and called me and we ended up being able to see each other after all.   Managed to put a big smile accross this face, I always love to see her, but if i cant just hearing her voice is enough to make my life get a quick rush of happiness.  We went and saw White Noise yesterday at the movies, it was pretty freaky, I usually dont jump when i watch movies, but this movie managed to give me a cold chill that i couldn't shake, and on more than one occasion i was jumping in my seat.  Ashley touched my hand one time and could feel the goose bumps forming on my hand.  I really enjoyed it.  We went back to the mall afterward for just a few minutes...the mall started to close and we almost got locked in...I think Ashley would have liked to be locked in...SHOPPING GALOR right babe.  When we were trying to get out this freaking asshole locked the door to Parisans right as we were about to walk in to go the parking lot, all i could think is what a  dick.  It was cold and we had to walk around the mall...i was soooo pissed.  But in the end I ended up having a great weekend...would love to do it again.  Im just sad that this weekend i will be in Mobile.  Im going to miss Ashely so so very much..we thought that she might have been able to go with us, but some things came up...If you read this babe i will be thinking of you all the time, and will be waiting to be able to see those beautiful eyes of yours.  Well I should probably go ahead and wrap this up.  So i guess i will go on this note....Im gonna make like a fetus and head out!
                                                                                                                  Later"

"event","Time for another update.  I just got home from having dinner with Ashley and my sister.  Today was my 3 month anniversery with Ashley, I felt bad for my sister having to be at home alone so we invited her to eat with us.  Ashley is absolutly amazing.  I know for a fact that I love her.  She makes me so happy inside, its a happiness I can't duplicate no matter what I do, nor would i want to be that happy without Ashley near my side, she truely is the perfect girl for me.  She likes the same things as me, she makes me laugh, and no matter what happens to me during the day and how down I am, I can always smile just by knowing that she is in my life and that she cares and loves me the same way i love her.   If you read this Ashley i love you so much and wont give you up for anything.  Ashley is truley the best thing that has ever happen to me, I thank god everyday that i found her.  Finally after years of praying for someone special to cross my path i found her and the lord has blessed me with a beautiful person, and i can never thank god enough and cant enjoy my life much more than i am now."

"event","Well exams are done! Thank god, managed to do really well in all of them.  Next semester will be easy with exams because i am automatically exempt from 2 no matter what, and getting A's in the other classes are gonna be easy....I hope. But anywho, not gonna worry about that now.  I just got in from work, actually wasnt a bad day, even made some tips, always a good thing.  But i signed up for Timberlines Christmas party, Ashley is going to be my date, and yet again, always a good thing.  The party is at the bowling alley, she is gonna kick my ass, she is good but holds back, then shell decide to kick your ass.  Im really looking forward to it, then saturday is our 2 month anniversery,  doesnt sound to big, but it is to me.  We havent had one fight, one disagreement, nor do we have any complaints or irritations with the other, its great!  Well im gonna close up this entry cause its moms birthday and were gonna eat some cake soon.  Then i might be able to see ashley for a few minutes. Later."

"event","Back home again.  My day of exams is over, i have one more now, government, it shouldnt be hard at all.  Teacher said the study guide was our test questions, and the study guide questions are basically just common sense.  So i dont have to work to hard now.  Im waiting on my parents to get home so i can see Ashley today, dad said he needs to ask me something and clarify something he saw in an instant message, i think he saw one of our jokes and is kinda iffy, no worries, nothing is going on so i dont have anything to be scared of, im just wondering what he wants.  Well im gonna go study some government and be done for the day so i can see ashley, i havent seen her in a few days and am starting to have withdrawls.  Later!"

"event","Well, this is my first entry in my journal.  Ashley keeps asking me to start one, so i figured that for her i could do it.  She really means worlds to me.  I care about her so much.  But anywho, im studying for exams tonight, which is major bull, im a senior in high school still taking exams, during the last few weeks of school it just seemed like all the teacher would say lets find the hardest crap we can find and test the kids on it!  But tonight is the only night i have to study, i managed to exempt the rest!  But im hoping to get done soon so i can talk to Ashley,  I miss her so much, seems that whenever im not with her it feels like weve been seperated for days.  i cant wait to hear her woderful voice again, it makes me so happy and seems to make the worlds problems just go away.  Well im gonna close this and go finish studying. Later."

"event","Did anyone else have a nice weekend?

Mine wasnt too horrific for once which is really unusual.

I have been told by manager that i am not allowed to supervise anymore due to my ""gothic"" image (his words not mine) Twat.I may reprt him for discrimination,but i cant be arsed at the moment.I may play up to his architypal preconception even more,so i can get transferred to the wines dept, where individaulity is encouraged (mostly as we work in the stockroom,flinging bottletops at eachother-so mature)

My boyfriend and me had a really childish argument over a song lyric on saturday.The lyric is:
""But you were in love with someother guy,who looked just like me,but i make you cry...""
I take this to mean that the person has changed,hence she doesnt love him anymore as she loved the guy as he was.My boyfriend takes this to mean that she is a cruel hearted bitch and isnt in love with the guy anymore as she has gone off with another guy.this caused us to have a massive fit at eachother-WHY!!!!!

Finish this in a mo"

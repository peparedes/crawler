"event","it is crazy how your life can completly change in a short amount of time. a few weeks ago i received the news that my father and step mother would be getting a divorce within a month. hearing this news crushed me. the first thing that came to me would be my father's feelings and what was going to be happening real soon. my ""step mother"" kat would bemoving out on the first week of september. i honestly did not mind that. but then my fathehr told me that we would be selling the house by december 1st. ultimatly i was worried, i did not know where i would be living or anything, because i knew i was not going to move to the middle of no where arizona and leave certain people behind. that was not an option for me. due to the divorce situation i grew close with my dad, we talked about everyday for a good amount of time. he told me stuff that he didnt even tell my ""step mother"" .with the stress of finding a new place to live i had to do a bunch of college stuff, get a more high paying job, and get a new car. this was all very stressful to me, but then i got over it, and i accepted it.&nbsp; then more bad news came, my finacial aid did not come through for college&nbsp;so basically i was finacially fucked because i can not afford college at this time in my life. but my father said he would pay, which i was reilived. last monday i took my placement test for college. i did pretty well on it. i came home and i talked to my dad about it. that monday i was going to go to the beach with my friend so my dad helped me pick out a good safe beach to go to. before i left to the beach my father checked all my oil in my car to make sure that i would be ok. tuesday was just a normal day to me , went to work, talked with my dad for a while, myspace, then hang with anthony. wednesday was the same. then thursday, friday, and saturday rolled around. i had not seen my dad. i didnt really think anything of it cuz it's normal for me to not see my dad cuz i am always in and out of the house working or just out. then sunday august 5th 2007 rolled around. i got up at appox. 11:20am , went on myspace for like a few mins, then i got a bang at my door. it was my stepmother. she yelled ""call 911"" . i opened my fuckin door and i saw my dad. i will never forget what i saw. i immediatly started to cry. because i already knew what i saw and what it meant. my father had passed away. that whole day seemed like a fuckin dream. i could not believe it at all. my last parent was no longer with me. i still cant believe it now. i dont really want to at this point. once i fully accept it, it wont be good. i try to be strong and not cry, but it is just so hard for me. i will hardlyy cry in front of people, only when i am alone. if you do ever see me cry that just means that i let my guard down. but i try to be strong not just for me, but for my 2 sisters aswell. because we are all in the same boat right now. parentless. my friends are now my family."

OK, so the day before yesterday which was a thursday july 28.

It was around like 2pm or so. dillon and eric come pick me up.

we go looking all over upland for brittany. haha

ok so then we eventually found her @ her casa sleeping like a baby.

we tell her to get ready and then we all start to drive around upland.

ok so then we r just driving around so we decide to go offroading which is awesome as fuck. and we go to brittany's granny's casa in claremont cuz her grandparents r away so we were chillin there. playin strip poker which was a little risky. so we stopped playing that.

then we just chilled and shit.


then we drove around everywhere

then after that we freakin went to mcarthy park and play around on the swings and shit. that was fun. i love the park.

then after that, we went back to her granny's .

then we went to PADUA hills @ night and we were by the theatre just looking at the stars. it was nice. then like we were going to go look for midgets but the gate was closed we were like fuck.

then all the knee grows in like a bajillion cars come and so she strike a chat with them. it was funny. then like so they go up the hill to see the midgets and shit. then like we got bored so we went up the hill also and we were like transporting the black people up and down the hill. it was fun.

so then we were all just chillin @ the top of the hill listening to some tight ass music.

then ...

ALL OF A SUDDEN!

BOOM!

the fucking police come around the damn corner. it nearly scared the shit out of me.

then like so the police got out and so did eric and the police told him to ""get his fucking hands on the hood""

so then dillon got out and like i was scared and in shock so i didnt move then dillon was like comeon jen.

so i got out of the truck and i was so so nervous. i was shaking like crazeeeey.

then he told us all ( in cluding brit eric dillon me and the knee grows) to put our hands on the hood.

then the police officer was like how old r u to everyone and then when it got to me he wa slike thats curfiew! etc.

"" do you guys want a ticket from 50-500$"" then like we all thought he was going to give us a ticket. then he was also like get in the back of the car.

he was like screaming at us like mad. he kept saying fuck.

but then after all that he just told us to leave.

it was the most scariest thing EVER!.

anyways so that was thursday. then on friday the 29th it was tight. we went off roading again with dillon and eric. that was fun. then we drove around everywhere. it was tight.

then today i did a whole lotta nothingcuz i couldnt go anywhere.

"event","welll since i havnt wrote in this thing for a couple weeeeeeeeks ill just sum up what i did. ok last monday i cant remember what i did so that means i didnt do anything. ummmMmMMmMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm on tuesday danny came over for a while before he left for S.D. then on wednesday i had my gay ass registraightion. that took forever. nd they gave me a shit load of boooks and everything. then after that we went to amanda's casa and hung out cuz she had to baby sit denny. then after denny left we went to the mall and stuff. then we came back here. then on thursday the only thing i did was go to the grocery store. but i was forced to do that. and on the way thee cat got a ticket for running a red light. she was pissed about that but its hur fault. then on friday...... oh yea we went to go see the exorcist the begingingg. that was one of the most scariest movies i have ever seen in my life. then after we got back to my house, there was already people here for the party or whatever.it was shelby....ugh...and ashley i think. idk their names and i dont care for them either. but then people just started to get here. umm then we smoked out of the hokah. then i forgot what happened after that. ooooooooooooooh yea. me and terrah were just hangin out on the couch and amanda came over with a smirn off twist rasberry thing and so we tryed it and liked it so we drank one. IT WAS NOT PEER PRESURE CUZ IF IT WAS I WOULDNT HAVE DRANK ONE ALL BY MYSELF. AND YOU JUST BROUGHT ONE TO US. ITS NOT LIKE YOU FORCED ME INTO IT. I TRYED IT CUZ I WANTED TO. and that was the very first drink i have ever really drinkin. and its only 5% achohol. soo its not like i got drunk or anything. it just taste like soda or that flavored water stuff. but then like around 1 or 2am i put in texas chainsaw massacre and that kinda settled people down. but then there was like a but load of people out side makin noise and shit. and krys didnt wanna be like ""uncool"" and tell them to shut up so she had me tell them that. and they were like all drunk and gay. and like i would be like hey keep it down out here blah blah blah. and this one dude was like but you told us that when u came out 2 mins ago. i didnt even understand them but whatever. then like this guy kept calling me avril. which was getting annoying. cuz when he left he was like bye avril. avril this avril that . ugh. then they left so it was just the poeple in the living room. oh yea and this guy and this girl went in my jacuzzi NAKED. it was gross. but then when the guy was changing. he dropped his towel and i saw his butt. hehehe. then ummmmm that guy left and so it was just this other dude amamanda heha and herrah and me. then we went to bed. ok then, onnnn saturday night we did like the same thing over again but with different people. ok umm oh yea i went out with constance like from 9:00-10:15pm then when we were pulling in front of my house, i saw a black honda civic, and i was thinking is that chad or isnt it? then like i hopped out and constance went home. then ok eerinie and amanda and chris and heather were all in the front yard so i went over there and said hi and stuff. then we all went in side and sat down in the living room and smoked out of the hookah again. that was fuuuuuuuun. then like um everyone went out side to smoke weed, except for me and ernie cuz I DONT WANT TO SMOKE WEED! and he just didnt want to get drug tested. he was being weird in there. he was like so do you have a boyfriend? do u have a boyfriend? he kept askin. all throughout the night he probably asked me like 5-7 times. thennnnnnnn i was like do u drink or anything? he was like no cuz i get kinky when i drink.......  so that made me feel uncomfortable. so he had to go somehwere so i went into my room. then um i was in there for like 15 mins just cleaning and stuff, then like i heard some yelling and screamin come from my living room.... i was like what the hell is going on out there?  then um oh yea terrah spent the night again so she came in my room and got me out so then we went out in the living room, and it was just chris illeregay , chad weelin , stacquesha , amanda , heather, krystle, me and terrah. so they were all singing . some people were drunk some where high, some were both, i htink. then um everyone but krystle and me were smokin weed. then ummm we just hung out then chris came in cuz he went out to talk on his phone then errnie came back with chris then they left. HEATHER WAS BEING ABSOLULTY CRAZY. EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING AT HER. hah. that was funny. then like around 1am or so, we started to smoke out of the hookah again and i asked amanda right before i was going to smoke out of it "" is there any weed in here?"" she said no, so i took a big hit or whatever. and then after i did that she quoted this "" I GOT JEN TO DRINK, AND SMOKE AND"" do something else which i forgot what she said. then after i did it i asked her again, was there weed in here she said no, then i pinned her down and i was like "" did you put weed in here!!!!!!!!!!!?"" she finally said yes. i was so pissed cuz i dont want to smoke weed or anything cuz its nasty. and she lied to me about it too which was totally messed up on so many levels. so now im not going to smoke out of the hookah anymore cuz i cant trust what they put in there. so thats fine with me. i just dont want to smoke weed. i dont care who its with but i just dont want to do it cuz first of all its frickin illegal. and the smoke gives me a headache and its gross. then after that i just put cds in to listen to them then a little later on we watched and extremly goofy movie like at 2am. then like around 3 or 4 or something i went to bed.then umm on sunday i didnt do anything. then today idk what im going to do but this week i get to go school shopping which is great. so we prolly will go shopping tuesday wednesday thursday and maybe friday. idk. well this is long enough, bye."

"event","hey. well yesterday was pretty fun. we left mi casa around 10ish i think and got there like around 12ish and when i got there they just had some food like apetizers or whatever the hell u call them. then like 1:30 or something the 1st round of food came out which consister of : hot dogs, brauts, hamburgers, corn, potatoe saled(ugh) , and some other salad and like olvies and a couple other things. then, later on was ""dinner"" which consisted of: 2 kinds of ribs, 2 kinds of chicken, steak, beans, 2 kinds of bread, and some other shit that i forgot. then for ""desert"" there was like 2 kindas of pies 2 kinds of cake, 3 kinds of cookies, oh and like a cheesecakey thing. so there was alot of shit. i didnt eat that much though, i tryed to contain my self to what i would regulary eat. then so we left their house like at 8:45ish and got home at 10:30ish. then i went to bed at 11:40something. and my ass hole sisters r so inconsiderate. they only care about them selves. ok krystle was on my comp til like 11:40 and i said make sure u shut it down, and she left and im like shut it down and shes like no, whatever. then i was thinking fuck u bitch. but i didnt say it. so they keep me up like every night really really late and wake me up like at 6am every morning so i only get like 3-6 hours of sleep. ISNT THAT SOOOOOOOOOO MEAN. thats why im so damn tired all the time. then on school nights, every day heather and amanda JUST HAVE to talk and say good night to eachother and say unuseful shit that no ones cares about like "" what r u going to wear tomorrow heather? "" or somethin like that, and they knoww im going to bitch at them to get off the phone so i can manage to get some sleep. ok then, when im really tired i get good sleep right>? but when i get good sleep i dont move around at night and when i dont move around at night my joints dont more for a few hours they cramp up and i get sore like every morning now! so with every cause, there is an affect on me! i hate that!"

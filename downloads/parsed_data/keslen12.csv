"event","My major problem at school was that I didn't know where I wanted to go, so I didn't go anywhere.  I've since put something in the cross hairs.  I got to thinking:  I've got two major strengths: Computer Science and Creative Writing.  These are two really odd things to have together, almost everyone has one, the other, or neither.  Then I started wondering what it was that I really enjoyed doing, what in my life gave me the drive to stay up late or push a deadline a little bit.  The answer came to me in a flash:  gaming.

The only thing is, I picked up the notion that a carreer in gaming isn't a real carreer.  It was an off hand remark by a professor who I greatly respect.  He made a joke about how most people in Computer Science are only in it to make games.  That led me to think that making games was a common thing, and since I wasn't common (man I really hate sounding that arrogant, but I have learned from many reputable sources that I am what they call brilliant), I couldn't have that carreer.  I'm working on shedding myself of that notion because it really is what I love to do, so I may as well earn money doing it.  Now all I have to do is work my ass off and get to the point where I am employable in that field."

"event","I walked in the door to my house today with my Mother and Uncle.  My mother's reaction of ""It's not that bad"" was very reassuring, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't smirk a bit while she was on the phone with my brother reacting to his ""It's really bad"".  I guess people can be forgiven for exagerating the state of things when they open the door to their brother's house not sure what kind of smell will greet them on the other side.

In any case, I've got a bit more of a schedule laid out.  Today's all about cleaning and landlord stuff, tomorrow will be a relaxing day where I will be going to a movie in the evening.  Wednesday my father will arrive and we will really start packing up.  Over the next few days after that my Brother will be here and we'll get all the heavy lifting done, and then on Friday we'll be spending some time in Toronto.  I don't think my family (mom, dad, bro and me) have ever been in Toronto together, so that will be really cool.

So, now that I'm leaving, I have a lot of stuff I need to get rid of.  In particluar, there's the three blue couch set.  An armchair, a loveseat, and a couch.  It would be really nice if they could stay in the Waterloo circle, since they started in the Imprint office, went to Tim, to Phil to me, and I'd really hate to be the end of that chain.  So, if you can get that set from my place to yours, you can have it free of charge (donations will be accepted of course).

It also looks like I have a coffee table, a couple of end tables, and a kitchen table (complete with two chairs).  As my brother claims stuff (he gets priority what with the blood relationship and all) and more cleaning gets done, I'll have a more thorough list.  So if you're looking for furniture, watch here for the best deals in town!"

Of course it will, it will have to be.  When you get right down to it, there's not all that much to do.  Clean the house (well, that'll take a full day), tell the landlord I'm moving out (pay July's rent at the same time), talk to an academic advisor (an hourish?), and say good bye to all the people who made life at Waterloo worth living, many of whom I'm sure don't know that they did that for me.

It's gonna be weird.  The idea of moving back in with mom and dad still feels like giving up.  No matter how much I tell myself that it's what I need, and that it's the best thing (both of which are 100% true), the feeling still doesn't go away.  I've also realized talking to my uncle that a non-trivial part of my problem is that I have yet to realy learn how to live on my own, and that's not something I'll be able to learn under Mom and Dad's roof.  But one step at a time.

My schedule over the next week or so is going to be wonky.  I still don't know when exactly I'll be flying back to Camrose, but there are still a lot of loose ends to tie up in Waterloo.  Landlord, Academic Advisor, good byes, etc.  It'd be nice if there were a party with everyone invited where I could say good bye to everyone, but since I don't know my schedule, and I'm in no condition to be organizing such an event, it's likely not going to happen.  Oh well, there's still MSN (which will be on my new email address - just change the k to an s, uwaterloo to hotmail, and ca to com and you'll have it).

So they did a rapid strep throat test on me and it came back negative.  That doesn't mean I don't have strep, there's just a 90-some odd probability that I don't.

I suppose in and of itself that would be good news, but Dr. Bowman said the most likely second place disease to fit my symptoms is mono.  Good Grief!  I was only social director for a week!!  In any case, I'm going in tomorrow for some more detailed tests.  Here's hoping I can get back to work before too long passes.

However, I really don't think that I have mono.  Don't get me wrong, I definitely have less energy than usual, but I've heard that when you have mono you can't even drag yourself out of bed.  Just five minutes ago I took my sheets downstairs and put them in the laundry machine (they were so gross from when I had a fever over the weekend).  However, I admit that the thought of parsing and washing the clothes in the chock full clothes hamper made me shudder (hence the less energy than usual).

"event","Blast it!!  I'm too mind-oriented!  I've been sitting here for the past 20 minutes trying to wrap my mind around this so I can formulate a proper way to write it, but it's nothing that my mind can wrap itself around.  Ironically, it's the mind wrapping that is of itself most of the problem.  I'm always so insistant that there be a logical reason behind everything, and when I press for one, the only one that has any semblance of relevance (That's the way it's always been done) comes up, and while it's technically accurate, there's so much more that an excessive brain oriented person can't contemplate.

I can point to at least five specific events in the last week that really irk me looking back on them.  In three of them I was presented with a situation where another person decided to take an action that was detrimental to another party where there existed an alternate action that would have made no difference to them but would have been much better for the other party involved.  In three of them I was that person (no, I didn't miscount, there's overlap).

I can't keep this ambiguous, it requires too much mind.

I was in the line-up for <I>Star Wars</I> with a group of my friends the other day.  We got there three hours early at 7:00 and thus acquired the coveted first in line slot.  While we had a group of 14, only four of us actually got there at 7.  Other parties trickled in, the next one came at 7:05.  Later on, some of our other friends arrived and joined with us to socialize while we waited for the doors to open.  However, one member of the 7:05 group was boorishly adamant that they should go to the end of the line.  Our group explained to him that we would be saving seats for them anyway, so in the long run it made no difference where in the line they were, but he was still adamant that they must go to the back, even after he was assured that they would not actually go in before him, they'd just stay with us to socialize and go to the back when the doors opened.  

Throughout this conversation I remained silent.  I heard every word, I knew that this guy was being unreasonable, and I'm sure that my friends agreed.  I knew that I had the ability to make this man realize that he was being unreasonable, and that if I were able to it could improve the night for everyone involved.  However, I was too mind-oriented, and so when I formulated in my mind the best way to do this, the plan that I came up with was more asinine than his initial actions.  After he had forced our friends to the back of the line, I spoke up for the first time in the entire conversation.  My statement was ""You know you're acting like an asshole, right?"".  After a short moment of shocked silence he replied non-verbally in the positive, and I stated ""Just wanted to make sure you knew that."".  While I still maintain that he was in fact acting like an asshole, and I'm sure my friends would agree, he wasn't as big an ass as I was in that instant, and when all was said and done, my friends were still at the back of the line for the remainder of the wait so nothing was accomplished.

Other events are similar, and I don't like myself much in any of them.  Even though I still know for certain that my reasons were logically correct, my actions were idiotic at best.

So I started writing this entry an hour ago, I haven't deleted anything, just taken a lot of time to think (too much mind again).  I'm going to leave it at this for now and just mull over it for a while."

Sam asked me to bring a resume over to the TD Bank at Conastoga Mall.  He outlined that the job pays $11/h, which is $3/h more than I am making right now.  Couple this with the fact that there would be no 7am OR 11pm shifts ever and that there is a direct bus line from my current place of dwelling to this new found potential for employment (not to mention the much better working conditions), and you have a prime location for me to visit on Monday.

I gave the land lord a call and she initiated the process of getting a repair guy here to look at it.  I hope it happens soon since I really would like to have some clean clothes to wear.

It was the most unusual shift I've ever had at McDicks today.  I was scheduled to work from 5pm to 11pm.  So at 4:57pm I punch in and start taking orders in the drive thru.  I take one order and the cash for it, then I take the next order and just as I'm opening the window to take the money the restaurant falls into complete silence.  Yup, the power went out.  The manager sent everyone who wasn't working until 11pm home, and the rest of us spent a couple of hours cleaning until there was no more light to clean by.  Then at 9pm the manger sent all the others home and it was just me and her.  We chatted about nothing for a while, and then at 10pm we were both blinded by the sudden onslaught of light as the power came back on (although ironically the noise was more startling than the light with all the humming and whirring of all the McInstruments).  I spent the last hour getting everything ready to work again and then handed it over to the night crew.  It sure is fun when you get paid to do nothing."

It just means you'll never know the humourous stories that I have to tell about in this LiveJournal.

Speaking of humourous stories, we cut locks last night.  I have a bruise on my chest, and it kind of hurt when I washed it in the shower this morning, but that's beside the point.  So some random guy came into the office today, and started ranting and raving about how we cost him sixteen dollars because we cut his locks.  Unfortunately, there are three huge holes in his story.  First, he's only supposed to have one lock, not two.  Second, when he signed up for the locker he signed a contract that stated he would remove his stuff and locks before the term ended.  Third, there were signs put on the lockers reminding him to do so.  It was extra funny because he knew he was supposed to remove the locks since he put notes on his locker stating something like ""I'm going to sign up for these lockers again, so don't cut them."".  If perhaps he had been unaware of the lock cutting, I could understand his anger, but at this point there's really no valid reason.

In other news:  McDonald's has really pissed me off.  Check out my schedule for the next week and a bit:
Fr:  5:00PM - 11:00PM
Sa:  9:00AM -  5:00PM
Su:  7:00AM -  3:00PM
Mo:  5:00PM - 11:00PM
Tu: -----------------
We:  5:00PM - 11:00PM
Th:  4:00PM -  8:30PM
Fr: -----------------
Sa:  7:00AM -  3:00PM
Su:  9:00AM -  5:00PM

This angers me because when I was hired by the store manager, I was told that I'd be working days, so I was expecting to be rarely (if ever) working after 5PM.  I spoke with the store manager, and she told me to speak with the scheduling manager.  I did so, and she gave me the standard hubpaloo about how she only had so many shifts to give out and blah blah blah.  Tomorrow I'm going to visit a factory and see if they are hiring.  According to a friend of mine, they always are, will give me 8:00AM - 4:00PM Mo-Fr every week, and pay me somewhere in the neighbourhood of $13/h.  It seems I'll be getting a better schedule and a better wage, not to mention getting in shape.  Sure, I'll have another job under my belt that lasted less than a year (Mel's Diner was the first one), but it'll be a hella lot more money when September rolls around, and a better schedule this term.

It feels like there's something more that I wanted to say, but I can't for the life of me think of it, so I'll just leave it for now and then I'll bolt awake at 2 or 3 tonight and realize it, make a note to post it tomorrow, and then forget it when I fall back asleep.  It'll be fun."

"event","I've been told that I ramble too much.  I'm not sure I disagree, but I stumbled across an interesting reasoning behind it.  Apparantly posts longer than 5 sentences tend to get zoned out of.  However, if there exist <I>n</I> posts of 1 paragraph each instead of 1 post with <I>n</I> paragraphs, then the zoning out factor negates itself.  It's worth a try anyway.  Plus it gives me higher marks on Sana'a's scale (Is that how you handle the possesive on your name Sana'a?  It seems kind of odd to me.), so bonus!"

"event","*sigh*  I really hope the weather starts behaving soon!  I've heard that it's supposed to be warm tomorrow, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

It hailed today.  I tried to catch some as I was taking some money, but the wind was blowing the wrong way, so I couldn't reach any.  Maybe that's a good thing.

I think the wind hates me.  It blows in my face when I'm going to work, and then it changes direction while I'm at work so it's blowing in my face on the way home too.  I don't mind it switching direction on me, I just wish it would miss one (and exactly one) sometime so that it's nicer to me.

I keep missing stuff happening at school because I'm at work.  I have yet to leave a shift on time (always staying at least ten minutes late to help cover a break or something.  Not that I really mind that, it's good money, but it'd be nice to catch a card game at school or something.  Oh well, I'm off tomorrow and Thurs, so I'm sure something will happen!"

"event","Work was nine and a half hours today.  Someone called in sice, and I said ""Sure, I'll take an extra $6.67 to cover the last hour of their shift!"", then since I punched in ten minutes early, and someone was ten minutes late coming back from their break, I wound up leaving at 8:20 instead of 8, and thus I worked for 9.5 hours.  Hurrah for $68 (before the government takes their share)!

I found out today that all McDonald's customers are stupid.  I guess I already knew that, but I really found it out today.  I've come up with a new measurement of intelligence, I call it the swipe intelligence.  It's measured as follows:  You put a card, and the place to swipe it in someone's hand, and then watch and wait to see how long they stare blankly at the display clearly displaying ""SWIPE CARD"".  The record is 53 seconds.

Then you assign each customer a value based on the action they (finally) decide to take from the following options:

a) swipe the card: 0 points
b) swipe the card the wrong way: 10 points
c) ask you what to do: 25 points
d) hand the pin pad back to you and say ""it's not working"": 30 points
e) drool on the pin pad: 100 points (how I wish I could block this one from my memory!)

Now add that value to the number of seconds they were debating on which action to take, and subtract from 150, and you have that person's I.Q..

And yes, that means there's some lucky person out there who managed to score negative on an I.Q. Test.  Doesn't he feel special?"

"event","It's a full house again.  Yup, five people living under this roof for the summer term.  Oh well, I did the same thing for the fall and winter, so it's just business as usual at this point.  I haven't met the new roommate yet, and don't know a thing about him/her, but time will tell all!

It's odd how I was more tired today after getting up at 7:30 than I was yesterday after getting up at 4:30.  I'm not sure how that happened, but I just hope that the trend doesn't follow tomorrow when I get up at 9:30!

The wind was nice to me today!  It was a brutal head wind all the way to work (even when I was turning 90`), but all the while I had the thought of what a sweet ride home it would be.  But the wind must have thought I needed more exercise since it turned around and blew even harder in my face on the way home!  *sigh*  As I said, exercise can't be a bad thing.

So what's the last thing you expect to find in a McDonald's crew room?  If you said a stampede of hippopotomi, you'd be pretty close to my answer of space aliens trying to take over the world.  However, I'm sure that a pornographical magazine wouldn't be too far down that list.  Now that I think about it though, I wasn't really surprised when I was on my break with someone else, and he got up and slid a ceiling tile over so he could access a magazine to oggle over for the 25 minutes he was allowed to be downstairs.  I guess I should put the petri dish of ebola virus above the porn on that list.

Update on promotional issue:  I spoke to others today who were in the position that I would be promoted to if I accept, and they seem to reccommend it.  It seems that if it comes down to it, I can always go back (at least one other person has done so).  Plus, it's an extra 1.18 an hour (or something close to that).  The only things against now are the extra responsibility.  I have to decide if I can handle it or not.  Must continue pondering."

"event","It's a very strange experience.  I'm referring to sleeping while there is a VERY loud party going on more or less right outside your bedroom door.  You never really quite get to sleep, but when you're awake you feel so tired that all you can do is just lie there and try to go to sleep.  Finally you manage to drift underneath the dream clouds and then someone laughs really loud and you have to start the progress all over again.  Note that this was while I was wearing ear plugs, the party was that loud.  In retrospect when I found out the party was going to be at my place, I should have called a friend and asked to stay over.  Oh well, 20/20 hind sight.

In any case, I must have gotten at least a half decent sleep since when my phone told me it was time to get up at 4:30am, I was no more tired than I usually am when my phone goes off.  I finally dragged myself out of bed at 4:47, and had a shower and ate a healthy (i.e. non-McDonald's) breakfast.  You'd be surprised how many weird looks I get when I don't bother buying food (with the standard 50% discount) come break time.

So you really have to wonder about some people.  Like a hard core vegetarian (even moreso than the vegetarians I know) coming into McDonald's to buy food.  You'd be hard pressed to find a more meat-heavy establishment.  This woman came in with her daughter and ordered a Grilled Cheese Happy Meal (NO MEAT) with fries (NO MEAT), a toy (NO MEAT), and an apple juice (NO MEAT).  Then she spent a good ten minutes grilling me on the salads and after I assured her four or five times that the Oriental Salad did not have any meat in it she ordered an Oriental Salad (NO MEAT), a Diet Coke (NO MEAT), and a fruit and yogurt parfait (NO MEAT).  And yes, she really did specify NO MEAT on each and every item (because we usually put a little bit of meat into the french fries...).  If that weren't enough, she came back about two minutes later and complained because the salad had a sticker on it which read ""Chicken Oriental Salad"" (because they usually put chicken on them, but since she had mentioned in passing that she didn't want any meat, I had them hold off on that step).  At this point I had to wonder if she even knew what meat looked like or if she had been born in a cave and never seen the light of day since one could quite easily look at the salad (the lid is clear) and plainly see the lack of chicken.  *sigh*  I only hope that the daugher actually doesn't like meat and that she's not just avoiding it due to her overbearing mother.

Speaking of things you have to wonder about, I have to wonder about getting promoted.  After working at this McDonald's for under a month, the Store Manager (Trish) has already determined that I ""really have what it takes"" to be a swing manager.  It's kind of tempting.  On the one hand it would mean extra money, but on the other hand, I would have to work two shifts a week during the school year instead of the one that I was pondering before.  That would cut into extra-curricular activities (i.e. MathSoc).  Although, now that the Math Faculty is going to be lifting the full-term requirements, I won't be having to take five classes, so things may just balance out.  I'll have to ponder this one for a while.

Then it was time to go home.  It was raining at the time, so I couldn't use my blades and had to take the bus, but I figured it would be a good opportunity to visit the bus terminal to update my supply of local bus tickets and purchase one for New York.  So I got on the number 7 and drove over to the bus terminal where I carried out my errands.  Then I had a slight problem, I found out the that 12 bus that travels within three blocks of my house didn't visit the bus terminal.  Thus I had to get back on the 7, which took me back to McDonald's, where I walked to University and got on the 12.  However, as the 7 was travelling down King Street, one of the passengers near the front of the bus started flipping out!  He started swearing and proclaiming his intentions to rape something (he seemed to be getting right in the face of someone we couldn't see in the aile in front of him).  The driver called back to please watch the language, and when it continued, he stopped at the next stop and pulled out his radio.  We sat there for about 20 minutes, not letting anyone on or off the bus, when all of a sudden the driver opened the door, got out and was almost instantly replaced with three police officers.  These officers took the unruly passenger off the bus, and another 10 minutes later we were on our way again.  In the mean time I had to ask the driver for another transfer since mine expired while we were waiting for the police.  Then I got off the bus and made a pit stop at Zehrs, and arrived home about two and a half hours after my shift ended.

Upon entering the house, I met Iftee (I have no idea if that's how it's spelled, but that's how it's pronounced).  He's the third roommate for the summer term.  He seems like an okay guy, but only time will really tell.

In any case, it's time to go to Jos's party.  I don't work until 9am tomorrow, so I can sleep in until 7:30am.  Ah bissful!"

"event","Well, so much for that eye.  I just got back from the movies.  I saw The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy with a bunch of people.  It was most certainly not the best movie I've seen in my life, but I in no way regret going to see it.  That robot's attitude really pissed me off though.

In other news, one of my roommates who's moving out found a sublet for the summer.  It's kind of a shame, I was looking forward to living with a reasonable number of people (2 others not counting myself).  There have been five of us here since I moved in last fall, and meaning no offence to any of my specific roommates, I have to say that five is too many.  I guess we'll have to see how four goes, then in the upcoming fall I'll hopefully be moving into a place where there are only two of us.  That would be really cool.

In any case, I'm going to go play <I>Tales of Symphonia</I>.  Have fun with life!"

"event","And here I thought that the whole time between the end of exams and the start of classes would be boring!  I went to a party at Tersigni's yesterday.  Apparantly Phil and I are more or less on par when playing Dr. Mario, and I have terrible luck when it comes to Euchre (I think I got over five hands in a row without a single bower among them).  That's one of the reasons I prefer bridge to Euchre, it's harder to get five yarboros in a row!  Not to mention the fact that the distribution is pretty skewed, which poses an interesting problem that Phil and I discussed.  What are the odds of getting a void in Euchre vs getting a doubleton in Bridge?

Consider the odds of a 2,1,1,1 hand in Euchre.  That's one spade (6/24) AND one heart (6/23) AND one diamond (6/22) AND one club (6/21) and the last card doesn't matter.  Thus the odds of a 2,1,1,1 hand in Euchre is 6/24 x 6/23 x 6/22 x 6/21 = 9/1771.  Since any hand besides that distribution has at least one void, the odds of a void in Euchre are 1 - 9/1771 = 1762/1771 = 99.5%.  So apparantly when Evan and I were both fully suited the laws of probability were smacking us in the face.

Consdier the odds of a 4,3,3,3 hand in Bridge.  That's three spades (13/52 x 12/51 x 11/50 = 11/850) AND three hearts (13/49 x 12/48 x 11/47 = 143/9212) AND three diamonds (13/46 x 12/45 x 11/44 = 13/690) AND three clubs (13/43 x 12/42 x 11/41 = 286/12341) and the last card doesn't matter.  Thus the odds of a 4,3,3,3 hand in Bridge is 11/850 x 143/9212 x 13/690 x 286/12341 = 8.77 x 10^-8.  Since any hand besides that distribution has at least one doubleton, the odds of a doubleton in Bridge are 1 - 8.77 x 10^-8 = 99.999991%.

So it looks like we were right Phil, the odds of a void in Euchre and a doublton in Bridge are within 0.5% of eachother, in that they are both hella likely!

So that was yesterday, and tomorrow there is another party at Jos's place.  And that makes today the eye of the social tornado!  It's just too bad I have to work at 6am tomorrow morning."

In any case, I'm currently in that limbo phase of life, where exams have ended, but classes have not yet begun, so most of my fellow students are out of town, thus there is little to no socializing going on.  Oh well, it makes for a good time off period.

Now I'm going to contradict myself and state that I'm going to the pub later today.  Time is unknown, but I will likely be leaving for school in the near future so I can find out.

As for anything else, it's been a fairly slow and lazy day today, but if you keep reading I'll eventually post something with a bit more meat to it once I have a more eventful day.  Until then, have fun!"

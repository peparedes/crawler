"event","It's all so personal, all so exemplifying the very essence of what is tainted and lost to oil in water; I beg to question the strengths of our trust in others and ourselves if we can't even sooth the wounds of another man's tease and tears at the flesh. How completely unhelpful you are when the milk is spilled. The lover, in his discomforts of what could have just been an unbounded intimacy had he not errored his seducings to the lonely brides and the forever mores; the genius and his wit which is bitterly compensating a lacking aesthetic appeal; the cruel child and his unwavering loneliness no matter the number of witnesses to his festering nothings and the people he leaves deranged on cathedral steps. Let us just cry until there is no pain for you, let's stop the sun from shining by closing the blinds so you can say it's raining, and smash the mirrors because only you know the pain of looking into them. There is no tomorrow when nothing was finished today.

Compassion. Compassion is what you want, whether you deny it or not because these problems of yours wouldn't be our witness if you didn't put them out on display. If you want to cry, then cry because I have care for you when you are blatant and honest to state you need it. Petty, you are, your need for attention, the competition of whose wound goes deepest and whose will last; because no matter if you win, you're just winning the game of losses. If all you need is an ear then let me be your listener, because that's what I want: I want to help you. I want to break your barriers and loosen your heart, because I can be your nurturer, this mother you obviously desire. Just close your eyes, love...

"event","While logging onto <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/"">Youtube</a>, I noticed an interesting video called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8x14cLGh5o&NR"">""The Coolest 8 Year Old In The World Talks About O'Reilly""</a> and checked it out. Only a few seconds into the video, the viewer will notice that it's a basic cut and paste project taking bits and pieces of what they've most definitely <i>had</i> the little girl say. Though I agree with the major message, I don't care for the child exploitation. My thoughts of the video became more unbalanced when I watched <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjc9g1-4ytI&watch_response"">this</a>. This video isn't really such a serious issue that it deserves political involvement (of course then again, conservatives need whatever dirt on liberals they can find to further their strengths in America) and it is being taken far too seriously. A <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVRbMfh52Ts&watch_response"">third video</a> only makes the debate thicken with technicalities; in the end, it's really just a matter of ""well if you can do it so can I"".

   My views are quite simple in conjunction with this: whether you are right or wrong, fighting fire with fire only ends in ablaze. If you wish your message to be heard, take a better stand than to expand on propaganda and the fury of our political world. The government happens to favor the conservative America and they will cover up any truth or power in your message by depleting it to its lowest points; this is why we cannot allow ourselves to <i>have</i> anything that would lower us such as using their bullets against them.

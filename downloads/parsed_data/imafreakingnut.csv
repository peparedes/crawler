sidenote.. i got a b in chemistry, an a in calculus, and a 3.5 gpa for my first semester. i guess you could say i'm freaking OVERJOYED!

i'm home for 2 and a half more weeks.. in which i will immerse myself in all that is christmas, drink lots, play a little taboo, and be with the people i love.

right now.. my life feels so wonderful."

"event","i feel like i've been seriously out of the loop lately with some people. and you know.. i'm kind of glad. maybe i don't need to know. when i do find things out about these people it's almost always from other sources than that person. i just don't understand how some people could act the way they do. i don't agree with it at all, and i don't understand why you would treat the people that you love and the people that are always there for you the way some people do. maybe i just take things too seriously, or too personally, but really- who's gonna be there for you in the end if you screw everyone over. 

lately i've just felt like forgetting about it. living my life, calling the people i love, seeing those that care about me, and just forgetting about the rest. if someone doesn't even have the decency to treat me with respect on the rare occasions that i do see them, then forget it. i just won't see them.


it feels so good to just get that off of my chest."

my major makes me cry. like hysterically. that's no good.. right?

didn't think so. i'm pretty sure i'd never get through mechanical engineering while managing to have somewhat of a social life and not being stressed out 24/7. 

i'm pretty sure i'm dropping my m.e. 101 class (which will put me at 14 hours.. that's enough right?) and being undecided for the first, and possibly second semester. then maybe accounting? psychology? ANYTHING BUT ENGINEERING!!?! yep.. sounds like a much better plan.

i don't want to spend my entire freshman year crying and stressing out.. and if that means taking less classes and dropping majors and feeling like a bit of a failure.. who cares. 

alex.. you are so right about south campus. during floor meetings i find myself gawking at the blonde sorority girls wondering ""do you have a brain?"" they seriously drive me nuts. 

so if you couldn't tell college has been a bit of a drag so far. it'll get better though."

"event","yesterday i got a phone call from tommy, one of the guys we hung out with on spring break, saying that chad, another guy we were with, had died the night before. i know we weren't that close to these guys, but we had spent the previous week living, eating, showering, and sleeping with them (in a non-sexual way that is). 
this guy chad was seriously the most awesome kid ever. he was such a sweet heart and had the best manners. the first day i met him i think he opened like 10 doors for me, and when there wasn't enough room for us at the table him and his friends got up and stood in the hallway to eat dinner. chad had the most contagious laugh i've ever heard. it was really loud and goofy. he said definitely in like every other sentence. i'm pretty sure it was his favorite word. 
he died when they got back to south carolina. he drives a mustang and was going 120 when his back end locked up. the cop said he was probably going around 80 when they hit the curb. his car flipped twice, threw him out of the window, then flipped again... landing on top of him. 
i just can't fathom it. i really don't understand why things like this have to happen. i hate that i'll never get to see him again. we had already started planning a road trip down to south carolina when we found out.. and now it just won't be the same. 
i guess in these situations all you can do is pray that he's in a better place."

my views on the infamous ""senior slide""...      it's not that we are too lazy to do the work or don't have enough time.. it's that the work is completely pointless and i will gain absolutely nothing from doing it, other than a good GPA and some keys money. but really.. it just doesn't matter much anymore.

so.. i believe from here on out i will do just enough work to have b's in my classes and study enough to learn the concepts of AP Calculus.. since that's basically the only subject i'm really going to need next year.

me and my little brother are getting along a lot better lately which i'm so thankful for. he's growing up so much and it kills me!! it seems like he should still think girls are gross and talk like a little bug or something.
me and my friend bobby (who are always off and on) are currently on (meaning we are talking and on the verge of dating) and have been since like august. he makes me REALLY happy and i love it! haha
tomorrow is cousins night and i couldn't be more excited PLUS harry potter and the goblet of fire.     
O H   M Y   G O D .    
let us take a moment of silence for the awesomely wonderful series and now movies. 
oh snap i can't wait!!!

well.. i guess that's about it. i hope everybody else has been doing equally as great."

"event","so.. right now i'm in the holiday inn at lexington, about to go to uk for a college visit. yesterday me and my mom went to murray and i really liked it.

i think i'm going to die my hair soon. (laura- if you read this, this is your cue to call me.)

i need to run. me and lura didn't run wednesday because it was our day off after 5 miles, and we couldn't run yesterday because i was out visiting colleges. ahh i need to get out!

now my mom is looking at austin pea..?? i've never heard of that place before in my life.

if anybody wants to suggest a school please feel free!!! i need help finding some places to consider. the last thing i want to do is settle on a school and sell myself short or miss out on a better opportunity.

well, i'm gonna go.

adios lovas."

<P><SPAN class=blacktextnb10><FONT face=Verdana size=2>for the first 2 hours of my drunkenness i was having a pretty good time, acting stupid, seeing a lot of my friends. then katie got upset about her and zach which made me sad, then i sat with bobby and his bitch nasty friends which made me angry, then katie told me something about this guy mason that made me realize i'm just not going to find a <STRONG>GOOD</STRONG> guy that is actually <STRONG>NICE</STRONG> and <STRONG>HONEST!</STRONG> so basically i was really really drunk and kept having to put up with shittiness and putting these two things together equals me sitting in the bathroom crying. i ended up calling my dad who was at the game and sobbing to him that i wanted to go home with him instead of going out, and i met up with him and we left. he aksed if i was on drugs which made me laugh and i said- no i'm drunk, daddy. then i realized what i said and started crying more because i though i would upset him and i didn't want to get in trouble. then he told me he knew that already and wasn't mad, but glad that i called him.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=blacktextnb10><FONT face=Verdana size=2>i&nbsp;really don't understand why i have these little breakdowns randomly. i really don't like the way i am when i drink and i deserve more than to be a stupid drunk girl. the whole drunk high school party scene is just getting so old. i honestly do not want to do this anymore.</FONT></SPAN></P>

"event","long time no update. my computer at home likes to not let me on livejournal so i basically only use it at school.
anyways.. this weekend was tons of fun. 
friday i went shoppin with becky then went to LRS fest with bobby, where i saw lots and lots of boobies. kinda gross. then i hung out with bobby for a while at his house. fun times.
saturday i went to the cheesecake factory with katie and we split a piece of banana cheesecake and it was SO DELICIOUS! then we went to this girl autumn's party and me and katie left at like 12 to go pick up my brother and his friends. she was drunk and they all knew. it was really funny. then we went back to the party and drank some. the cops showed up, hoppen a 10 foot tall wooden privacy fence. i ran into random pole in the yard and hurt my knee and katie scraped her leg while climbing the fence. the only reason we didn't kill ourselves is because this guy mason caught us. after that we went to st barnabas and played on the playground to kill time before returning to the party. i tried to give katie a piggy back ride and almost killed us. when we got back to our cars we didn't wanna go back into autumn's house because we didn't really know her so we just crashed in our cars. it was probably the most uncomfortable night i've ever had. 
it was still fun though.
hope everyone else had a fun weekend."

"event","i'm so wonderfully bored. yep... however i am becoming increasingly more excited about Creation. today i talked to grace's mom about food and such and she brought up how horrible it would be if i had my evil ""friend"" but i dont think i will... anyway she told me funny stories and it was a good time. 

so i've been free from school for a while now and i have to say it's pretty boring... i need a job. because che ching needs to start flying my way. i also need to get my shots for college i'm starting to feel like a pin cushion. 

yesterday a bunch of guys came over to swim and jesse put a piece of plastic in his mouth because he thought it was candy. the weird part was that he continuously tried to eat them like they would somehow turn into yummy treats or something... silly goose trying to eat plastic..."

"event","yesterday after the best day of school, the last one, i celebrate by going to my orthopedic doctor. it was fantabulous... anyway i was complaining about how my old lady meds aren't really doing anything so i asked if there was any way they could speed things up like perhaps a shot and so he replied sure. and he stuck 3 or 3.5 inches aka the whole needle into my knee! 

it was freaking insane! there's no other way to describe it at all.... it was crazyness."

today i went to pete's church for a bring a friend thing. i do have to say this, liz you missed out. if almost cried laughing because of pete's boyband so liz would have been bawling her eyes out had she been there. pastor paul was a cool cat. i'm glad i had the chance to hear someone else speak for once. it's nice to have a change.

i can't believe schools almost over but it seems like everyday the days get longer and longer and longer. it's weird i expected to become overly sentimental because they're my last days of high school but i'm not. maybe i'll care once it's over... we'll see. all i can say now is i cannot wait for it all to be over! graduation here i come!!!!"

well my real reason of writing is to say how awesome of a time i had at prom. the only thing i didnt like was that i was soooo freaking hot. dinner was super yummy i had a sole. i should say soul because it'd sound funnier.... then we went to Allyssa's to get in the limo bus which was nice except everyone's families were there taking a million pictures so it seemed like paparazzi, seriously it did. i'm not exagerating like i often do. there were at least 35 people taking photos all at once! 

during prom i got sandwiched in between rachey b and sean it was happy... la di da im trying to think of really spectacular things but everythings kind of blurring together... i ate really good cake! it was really yummy chocolate and walnuts. wow this is starting to sound really lame so i'll go bye 

so if you want to check out the pics taaaah daaa http://www.ofoto.com/BrowsePhotos.jsp?showSlide=true&Uc=hwghdb7.7gnac0r3&Uy=-lrtc4p&Ux=0


ps. lately i've been grabbing a lot of people's asses... now that i think back i should probably stop sexually harassing people hahahha"

"event","ok ok i've put it off long enough. 

today the movie man (the radio guy) was my sub in art today. so what better person to ask about his opinion on rocky horror. he said he actually liked it! because it mentions some movie he adores and then he went on a rampage about how weird tim curry is. it was quite nice considering the last time i spoke with the movie man he told me i'd become an artist and end up on welfare with kids.... so now he has almost redeemed himself oh wait never mind he said i looked like i was 14... yeah that pissed me off a little but mostly i was pissed because my skin is rejecting itself and has broken out.

so the true marvel awaits.
rocky horror well well well ok. the first time i saw it i was so utterly confused! not that i was any less confused the second time i watched it! but anywho the first reaction i had during rocky horror was ""what is burning and stinging my face!???"" and then i realized rice was being thrown about and that i shouldn't be alarmed. did i mention that I LOVE ROCKY HORROR! so i went again last friday and rachey b and katie and i drove down to jenkintown (we met grace and her friends there) and i dressed up as Columbia and rach took her shirt off and said ""i'm janet"" unfortunately none of us got too much recognition in the costume hooplaah but emily toopes did. :) the best part was probably when grace and i got to be the bride and the groom in the beginning and i got to toss the flowers. it was good fun. i know i'm leaving a lot out but that's just one more reason to see the movie. 

on the way there we got stuck in traffic and we saw a woman wearing a mustache. about a minute later we passed her again and she had no mustache anymore! luckily i captured the mustache on film so no one can deny it!!!"

i had an enconter with cops and they were actually nice to me! i was in west chester taking photos in the dark for class so i had parked in a parking lot where i shouldn't have so i was like shit they're coming to yell at me. and of course they have to pull up as i'm trying to get my tripod back together again. and guess what all they wanted to know was what i was doing and why. so i had to explain everything and that was that. so there are nice popos out there who knew?"

"event","ok so on Sunday i rear ended someone which totally sucks ass! it was totally my fault but i would like to give a tad bit of advice to other drivers out there. when stopping at a stop sign (this assumes you have plenty of room to go) do not stop go and then stop it confuses the hell out of people. im not blaming anyone but myself just to make that clear. 

through this whole thing i learned something kind of cool. so on sunday night i had the student achievment banquet and i was called up to the podium which means you automatically win 100 bucks. and thats what i did :) so that's going toward paying my parents back. i just thought it was cool how God provided there. i mean it doesnt cover everything but im not like some people who seemed dissappointed when they ""only"" won 100 bucks. i mean what are they complaining about? 

but what i really need now is a job. yep... any suggestions?

ps. i will explain at the marvel of rocky horror some other time!"

"event","so tonight i'm going to see rocky horror with grace's new friends from dc and rachey b 84 and a bunch of other people. i'm all excited i mean come on any reason to dress like a mix between a prostitute and a transvestite is good in my book. lol yay! wouldnt be funny if i brought one home to freak out my mother. hm... i can finally wear my pink fishnets again even though they have giant runs in them. :) kira is letting me borrow a black skirt because i dont want to go in my halloween boy short things... 

i think i might have a urinary tract infection. it doesnt burn when i pee but i have pressure on my blatter. but i drink so much crap with vitamin C in it though which creates a hostile environment for bacteria or something. -the end"

"event","so today i determined where i'm going to school next year. I've decided on emmanuel college. and i'm sooooo happy that's done with. that stress is done with!!! 

tomorrow i go to the doctor to find out whether or not my knee is going to get chopped off. i'm secretly hoping they'll just rip both my legs off right then and there! hopefully they can finally figure out what the hell is wrong with them. i'm hoping it's nothing too serious because i dont want to have surgery. not that anyone usually does.... but i somehow felt like i should add that on. yeah.... so think happy thoughts for my knees

oh oh oh!!! i get to unveil my pots from the wood fire kiln tomorrow too! i'm so excited! it's so crazy because there's no control over the glazes because the ashy loves to be free and turn into to glaze so hopefully they dont look like complete crap. i bet the glaze on my tall pot and my medium will suck but that ugly mug will look super sexy. well i'm off to bed!"

"event","ok i have such a predicament. i've narrowed down my choices to two schools. these would be easy if both schools were similar and could be compared but no of course I jess can not pick two schools that are even remotely similar. so here are my choices and reasons why to go to either school

Emmanuel
counseling psychology 
art therapy 
guaranteed campus housing (aka dirty dorm bathrooms) 
more of a campus
on edge of Boston

Suffolk aka mini NYU
random scattered buildings
social psychology
off campus housing (aka apartment)
smack in boston
offering me some money

i cant figure this out. suffolk is just newer snazzyer and emmanuel is catholic and has this 1960's style library (not the good 1960's happy feel either...) i wouldnt mind the catholic thing really because it doesnt really conflict with daily life there.... i've been thinking should i just flip a coin or what!? im so utterly confused tomorrow i'm going to talk to my bro's old roommates younger brothers roommate who went to suffolk for a year. he didnt like it so i hope either way i fall in love with the school. 
bu was such a disappointment. i mean honestly do i want to spend 35,000 bucks a year for classes that have more than 200 people in the beginning. i wouldnt be able to pay attention at all!  it just didnt fit with me. so my first choice went to the bottom crazy how that worked out and my random schools i applied to are real choices now.

let's do a vote where should jess go next year!?"

its just so weird. you know what really sucks the fact that tomorrow i have to wake up at the crack of dawn and go to school. i love sleeping. it's my favorite past time. honestly it is and to add to my love of sleeping lately i've been having weird dreams again so that totally makes sleeping worthy.

"event","have you ever watched the movie fight club? its soooo fucked up. there's no other way to describe it. first of all hats off to the way its filmed. i'd like have a moment of silence for how extremely good looking brad pitt is. i mean how many men do you know of that can get their asses kicked but still look amazingly hot. all of this is of course nice but really that has nothing to do with the movie. i dont want to ruin it for anyone but it truly is one of the crazyest movies EVER! 

so you might be wondering what am i ranting and raving about it really wasnt that insane. but to those who believe it was just another movie you're full of crap. let me know if you can think of another movie has wonderfully mad as this one.

"event","so for a while now i've been searching for the perfect job. i still haven't found it but i guess i have to give up on that. today i went job hunting at the mall and i came home with a purse, 2 scarves, and a snazzy skirt and 5 applications... i'm really hoping i get a job somewhere that i dont have to look out of the ordinary. the acme days ruined uniforms... so these are my choices a bookstore, limited two, a jewelry store, h&m, journey's so i would benefit from all discounts except limited two but whatever less temptation i guess. 

has anyone seen that toys r us bunny commercial i'm not sure what to make of it. it's so very odd. they shouldnt have picked albino bunnies... the red eyes are just creepy and speaking of creepy do not waste your money on dawn of the dead! it's soooo bad maybe it would have been good if there had been a plot but there really wasnt any. just a lot of blood, guns and biting... and not the good kind!"

"event","Today marks the day i was birthed 18 years ago. I also share this day with jason but i would like to clarify one thing i'm older. yeah that's right sucker! 

well let's see i woke up because rach was going to take me out to a fabulous breakfast. pancakes with strawberries and chocolate cake. can you beat that!? honestly i dont think anyone can beat that! 

pete sent me a bunch of happy text messages apparently i'm the weirdest person he knows. i guess that could be true... i told him he only wishes it was contagious. can you imagine how absolutely INSANE that would be? 

I gave jason his bday present. a dot-to-dot book of naked women. my mom really liked it she cracked up. only my mom would love those presents as much as i do... so anyway jason completed a dot-to-dot and what can i say the man was tied to a bed and had a smile from ear to ear. 

one last thought for now: WHY DOES MY CAR HATE ME!?

"event","i somehow got sucked into this.... partially out of boredom and partially because what better way is there to have the false trust of a diary and the ability to share my most secretest thoughts with world.... anyway... 

once again i've gotten in a fight with my family. nothing new there. if our fights were like contractions everyone would have birthed eight kids by now including the men. strange thought... first of all why is life so freaking stressful? and why can't i enjoy my vacation? quite simply all this is torturous. like colleges i just dont understand why we stick to this system... i mean people go to school for at least four years and then they obtain degrees and go into jobs they hate. and everyone keeps telling me the same things as though i'm some dumb bimbo... incase they haven't noticed i'm not although their lives seem much simpler. and somehow by not wanting to do that i'm insulting my family? does that makes sense? i think not! exactly! it's not supposed to because what might be logical must automatically be denied.... ironic isn't it?

i think the key is to avoid them at all cost. luckily with my upcoming birthday freedom will be mine for the taking. and if its not i will take whatever i can latch my hands on."

"event","<P>&nbsp;I've been thinking a lot lately. God's been teaching me a lot lately. It's very exciting. I'm not mentally prepared for a long, insightful update though, so don't get excited. <BR>&nbsp;I got my wisdom teeth out on Friday. My face is still a little puffy, but all things considered I'm doing really well. I feel fine and no infections occured. I'm tired of eating mushy food though. I want pizza and a cheeseburger! I got glasses on Monday. It turns out that I couldn't actually see while I was&nbsp;driving. Who knew? They make quite a difference in reading signs and other things that are far away. :) Today, I went to Kernan's and told the doctor that my knee was better. And, that is not a lie. I am so excited to finally be better and not hurting. Tomorrow should, hopefully, be my last day of physical therapy.<BR>&nbsp;Tonight was our last D-team. It was a good night and, in my opinion, we ended on a really strong note. It's going to be kind of weird I guess. I mean, four years worth of Tuesdays went to D-team. Now, it's not there. It's a change. Here's what Lynn and I decided...<BR><FONT color=#000099>TinkTink313: its just a change<BR>TinkTink313: it takes me awhile to get used to change<BR>TinkTink313: a very long while<BR>leslietalk: i know<BR>leslietalk: it's not easy. change is never easy... unless it's like ""i have no more physical therapy"" kind of change<BR></FONT><FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;Everything ahead of me is exciting. Everything behind me was exciting. Life is just exciting. For the first time in my life, I'm taking the Emily Goldberg stance on life. Sure, I can't be positive all the time, but I can try. <BR>&nbsp;Ok, the thoughts in my head are getting jumbled because it's so late. I'll go now.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P>&nbsp;As I told TS today, I would be lying if I said that this trip hadn't made me consider skipping college and coming to live in Brazil to help the McMs. This is just phenomnal. Everything that they are doing is strategic and also pleasing to God. They have it down pat. I am so glad that we have been able to serve them in useful ways. M McM was telling me that they are just really appreciative and that she feels like we are serving them in the perfect way. I am blown away by her. She told me and TS tonight that she was, ""Looking for a way to get me to stay in Brazil with them..."" Then she said it again to Farrell and Emily. I was flabbergasted. She's just amazing. G McM shared his story tonight, and it was really awesome. I can relate on a lot of levels to what he went through, and the tact and grace with which he shared it was really great. Not too heavy, but also not too flimsy. He's an awesome man.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In short, because I am tired of writing, I so far could not have asked for a better experience over the past few days. We had a fairly large kink in the team tonight, but TS talked to the holder of the kink and all relationships were restored immediately after. God totally answered my prayers on that one. The whole time they were talking, I was praying. And, everything was better than back to normal after the conversation. Praise God! :)</P>
<P>I'm out. I might post again, but probably not. We only have 3 days left and I want to suck the life out of them.</P>"

"event","<P>The first update from Brazil...</P>
<P>We got here a day later than expected because our flight was bumped back 24 hours because it was way overbooked. This was, at first, a bummer. But, the team handled it really well. United Airlines put us up in the Hilton at Dulles, which was swank. We slept well, ate well, and got to go to the National Air and Space Museum. It was good, but we wanted to change clothes. We flew all night and spent the next day in transit and at the airport. It went surprisingly quickly though. We finally arrived around 7 pm, I think. We came to the McMahans and met Glenn, Michelle, Connor, and Thomas. They are amazing, and everyone on the team can testify to this. The girls are all staying with them, and I feel really privileged. They are rich in life experiences. We met some Brazilian girls who came to see us that night. They are warm, inviting, affectionate, and extremely open to being friends with us. It's fantastic.</P>
<P>The past few days, we've been working on some cultural exchange activities. We've been making friends with a lot of Brazilian teens and it is great to watch our kids interact with them. They are very accepting of everything American, and our kids are overall very accepting of everything Brazilian. We <A href=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y53/leslieb87/IMG_1664.jpg"">played basketball</A> one afternoon and today we went to the mall. The girls also got to visit the school that many of them go to and we had a karaoke party. In the midst of all of this, we are holding discussions in hopes of being able to share our faith with them. It's a great experience. And, the best part is that it is something that the kids can take home with them. You can always establish relationships with people... Regardless of what country you are in.</P>
<P>There is so much more that&nbsp;I could write, and I would love to. But,&nbsp;I don't have time. We're having a wonderful time. Please continue to pray for us and the students that we are touching here in Londrina. Thanks!</P>"

"event","<P>i just found a blog group on livejournal devoted to complaining about ms. hamill. needless to say, i am very disappointed in a few of my fellow students. (not kayla or sarah, who have both commented once on a particular entry). one student suggests that we go to the board of education and that if they don't listen we go to the press. what kind of distorted plan is that? we shouldn't ruin her life. i understand that many people in our class do not like ms. hamill. some of them have valid arguments. this person in particular, who has spoken with me about her several mishaps with ms. hamill, has no such arguments. when you consistently do not do your work and&nbsp;talk back&nbsp;to the teacher in the middle of class (if i were teaching, i would've kicked her out), you can't blame much on the teacher herself. </P>
<P>i give ms. hamill a lot of credit (as jack did in his comment). she is a brilliant writer. she has taught us to write well-crafted essays with the best syntax, diction, tone, etc. all the analyzation that we do actually serves a purpose... it's to teach us different ways of writing so that we can thus implement them in our own writing. many argue that she doesn't know anything about the content. i beg to differ. the woman, and no matter who you are you have to admit it, is brilliant. absolutely brilliant. sure, her methods of annotating seem a little bit out there, and her note taking on the overhead is a little creative/wild(?), but she is a teacher and she is just getting excited about her material. sometimes, this excitement goes a little overboard and causes her to expect a little too much out of us, or it just goes over our heads. but, can you blame her? pick your most favorite thing in the world... you could go on and on about it forever too. </P>
<P>i am also disappointed in the students who have chosen to make rude comments about her. i understand that people want to criticize her teaching methods and, in some ways and on some levels, that kind of criticism is acceptable. but, when it comes to people just bad-mouthing her because they are immature and feel like saying that she should, to use other people's words, ""go **** herself"", it crosses a line that i deem unacceptable. of course, i have fallen pray to complaining about her outrageous feminism attitude, but i wouldn't even think of some of the things that some people say about her. to me, this just shows an sense of stupidity in the student. </P>
<P>there is a lot more that i could say. perhaps more will come later. for now, i would like to end this entry. and to the juniors i would say, ""if you don't enjoy english as it is, then don't take this class. if you like english and do well in it, then take the class.""</P>"

"event","<P>so.... let's see. i updated on february 7th. it's now 4 days later. since then, i have done a few things. mostly, i have gone to school, done NHS stuff, and done homework. i did squeeze the gym, d-team, and a band concert in. but mostly, this week has been the week of homework from hell. for some reason, there was a ton of english stuff. and it's not even because i procrastinated. for once! i still have a book packet and a vocabulary quiz to make up from&nbsp;my week in annapolis. olivia has strept throat. i am trying to stay away from her, but the doctor said that there was a 30% chance that everyone in our house would get it. i can't afford to miss anymore school. especially since i'm doing another annapolis week in march. no sicky for me. well, even if i am sick, if i can walk, i'm going to school. that's just how it is. </P>
<P>yesterday was a really bad day. it started out alright. but then we had to talk about hamlet in english. i hate the play. usually i don't have a problem getting through literature that i don't like when it is necessary for class. but i just hate hamlet. usually i can b.s. an 'i love this book' response to make ms. hamill happy, not this time. i flat out told her that i hated it. she might not like me anymore. but, i don't care. if she doesn't like me anymore because she found out that i don't like classic shakespeare, then i don't want her to like me. so nanny nanny boo boo. haha. i'm like a 4 year old.</P>
<P>today, i went&nbsp;to school. surprise surprise. first period was, as usual, ap biology. we watched a movie on evolution which i do not believe or like. i find it impossible to believe that when rock storms stopped the earth cooled and all the vaporized water became liquid and then some lightning struck and the inorganic molecules in the water got themselves together to form amino acid chains. it just doesn't make sense. besides, where did the water that was at one point vaporized come from? whatever. it's part of the curriculum. then i went to mrs. hastings' second period class to talk about girls' state and annapolis. they were not very enthusiastic. but, they listened and laughed on occassion. then i went to band. caitlin and i did everything we could to get out of it, but nothing worked. so, we went in the band office and got online and took the chapter 15 psychology test because we are awesome. yay. then i went to standard biology... aka aiding. haha. mrs. laun had me run off copies of drill sheets. here is an example of her randomness... drill sheets: 33 blue, 33 green, 33 pink and 33 yellow all with holes. haha. first of all, what's with the number 33? second of all, what's with the colors of the rainbow? haha. and, the gestetner was being a bit tempermental, so that was a pain. mr. miller helped me and then had me come in his room and watch a video. haha. he is soooo nice! then i went to lunch. it was lunch-y. then i went to mrs. hastings fourth period class and i found my two biggest fans there! <STRONG>MATT AND MARIA! </STRONG>they made me smile. they clapped for me. haha. thanks guys! you're awesome! fourth period was way more awake than second period. i remember having mrs. hastings fourth period last year. i had her fourth period all year. it was wonderful. simply because i loved her class and it made my day better. plus, it kept me in school all day because skipping was really&nbsp;a problem for me. haha. just kidding. the best part about having it fourth period is that you have all day to cram before the test. anyway,&nbsp;i went to psychology and it went surprisingly fast, but i was still bored. </P>
<P>lacie came over at at 2:45 today and we planned d-team for next week. well, we mostly just hung out and talked about all of this random but very important stuff. it was good. i love that girl. now i am babysitting for olivia and joshua and they want their popcorn, so i am going to go. have a lovely weekend.</P>"

"event","<P>Last time&nbsp;I updated for real, it was the 26th. It is now the 31st. Some catching up to do?&nbsp;I think so. </P>
<P>Early Friday morning, my dad and I left from BWI. Destination: Waco, Texas. We flew in to Austin and drove the 2 hours to Waco. Nothing exciting about either one of those things. We wandered around the Baylor University campus on our own. My dad managed the map and told me about everything. I just sort of wandered and sent a billion and one text messages. (Lynn, I'm taking after you! I went over by 257 text messages. Haha!) Then, we went and had dinner with Dan and mary Folkemer. It was great to see Mary again. I miss her a lot. We keep up in email-land, but seeing her and talking to her face to face was great. We went to this Tex-Mex place called Ninfa's. It was yummy. Then, the first official activity of the Baylor Premiere began. It was this mixer with all these students. It was stupid and I wasn't impressed. Saturday morning, we got to the campus around 8:45 am. We went into the sports arena which was really sweet. Then, we got a ""Pick and Choose"" time and I toured, or ""turd"" as they say in Texas, two residence halls, ate lunch at the campus Chic Fil A, and then went to a session on the Study Abroad Program. Then, I went to a session held by the Biology Department and another one held by the Education Department. Neither one of the sessions appealed to me. The Education Department requires that you become ""proficient"" in Spanish. I don't want to live in Texas, where tons of people speak Spanish, and I don't enjoy Spanish as a language. So, that was a no. Then, the Biology Department seemed to be geared all towards pre-med... which is definitely not something I am interested in. Also, the town of Waco is about as empty and boring as you can get. Apparently, it used to be flourishing.... <STRONG><EM>back in the 1880's! </EM></STRONG>No good for me... I was a little disappointed that I didn't find what I was expecting. But, I got what I wanted out of the trip. I wanted to know if Grove City was the college for me. And, it is. Now, I just have to get in. Eeeek. March 15!&nbsp; Let the countdown begin. </P>
<P>So, we got home Saturday around mid-night in the midst of the snow and freezing rain. Church was cancelled on Sunday and I was very very sad. This is the second Sunday in a row that has happened. Boo. I laid around the house, watched a move, worked on my English paper, etc. It was, overall, very boring. </P>
<P>I went to school this morning and came home at 10. I don't have to leave for Annapolis until 12:45, but I didn't feel like being in school. So, I went to Bio and took my quiz in Econ. That was all that was necessary. Crap! I'm missing peer mentor/aid. Haha. Just kidding. And English... oh, I'm going to miss that. Darn. Not. I get to miss 3 days. Wheee! <lj-cut text=""guess what stupid did?""><BR>So, Mr. Giordano gives us a test. It has 54 multiple choice questions on it. Your standard scantron sheet has the first 50 boxes on the front and the second set of 50 boxes on the back. It's not hard to flip the scantron over when you send it through the machine. But, he's too stupid for that. He graded all of our tests wrong because he forgot to get the back of the scantron. Now, I suppose that any teacher could have made this mistake. I've never had one that has, but I suppose it's possible. If it were anyone else, I would cut them some slack and maybe just laugh it off with them. But, Mr. Giordano's list of stupid things is just too long already.<BR></lj-cut> so yeah. that's awesome.</P>
<P>now, i am going to go and prepare myself for my drive to Annapolis. Should be fun. Or not. I'll have to go to His Way tomorrow or something and get a new CD with my gift certificate. I'm going to need some music! Wish me luck!<BR></P>"

"event","<P>yesterday, after my post, i did nothing. well... nothing productive. i went on a mile long walk/run. the first since my surgery. it was invigorating. the cold was great, i had some good music, and it was awesome to be moving and exercising again. i really have missed sports and, thus, exercising. i got some endorphines going, and that made me happy. ""exercise makes endorphines... endorphines make you happy... happy people don't kill their husbands."" (what movie? what movie? haha) so then, i came home and left to go out to dinner with my dearest sonja. we went to chic fil a and, as usual on a tuesday night, saw all of the middle school crew. we had a great time catching up. i have truly missed her. its been so long that i gave her her christmas present last night. that was sad. but it was exciting to watch her open it. yay. then we headed over to d-team. i thought it was a really great night. prayer time was really good. like amazing. the best i've had in a while. and.. the book! oh the book! i <EM>love</EM> it! it is totally the story of my life! john ortberg is my hero.</P>
<P>today... my first day without calculus. i can't say that i missed it. but i did miss the breakfast club. i missed being able to hang out with them in the morning. i sat in my car. that was boring. in ap bio we finished mapping out dna. enjoyable. band was awful. i really don't enjoy mr. skinner. i want mr. wharton back. scott yelled at jordan manger and used the f word. i was shocked. (not really) aide... what a wasted period. i sat in the back and listened to mrs. laun introduce biology to her standard freshmen. haha. wow. they are quite a group. then, i helped put crickets in aquariums for all of the biology teachers. that was kind of not fun. they hop all over the place. and i feel like i have crickets crawling all over me. ap psych was, as usual, boring. it had its amusing parts. but overall, very boring. </P>
<P>i was really antsy today. i had this great fear that i hadn't gotten everything in for the page program next week. and i'm missing a week of school. and all of a sudden i just had this major anxiety attack. i kept trying to hold it in. but it kept haunting me. i had this vision of me calling the lady who's in charge and her being like, ""oh. we never got your stuff. you can't do it. you're a failure."" and then, i would have to tell all of my teachers and, worst of all, mrs. hastings, that i wasn't going because i was a failure. i am pretty neurotic. but, i called her and she was really nice. her name is cornelia watson. i sort of had this preliminary vision of her as a mean old woman. the name cornelia was just kind of intimidating. but, she didn't sound old and she was really nice. and i have everything together. so, that was all very good news. i am thoroughly relieved. </P>
<P>i am going to the gym with squishface in a few minutes. we are going to have fun and get some endorphines going to that we don't kill our husbands! woo. okay.</P>
<P>i am expecting a comment from matthew mcdaniel about his weight-training class and&nbsp;from maria about her new calculus experience. and , of course, anyone else who wants to leave a comment.</P>"

<P>calc.- 1 hour and 55 minutes long! eek. i took the final. finally. it was... painfully awful. more on that later. i drew maria a picture that looked like this.... <A href=""http://photobucket.com/albums/v645/luckyduckylelly/?""><IMG class=pic height=144 alt=calcpic.bmp src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/luckyduckylelly/calcpic.bmp"" width=159></A>&nbsp;<A href=""http://photobucket.com/albums/v645/luckyduckylelly/?""></A>i knew i did badly. more on that later also. eeew. but, i'm glad to have calc. over and done with. it was one of those things. i got screwed over when someone told me i could take it. i didn't have the necessary pre-requisites. but, i stuck it out and managed not to fail. go me.</P>
<P>ap econ.- only 55 minutes long! woo hoo hoo! we did a drill. and then played a stupid game about cartels for the whole rest of the period. it was dumb</P>
<P>ap bio- i love that class. allison and i have so much fun. we sit in the very front in the middle. haha. we laughed seriously for the whole entire class about the most random weird stuff. we did out gel electrophoresis. that was awesome. then, we went over some evolution stuff and mrs. laun did a powerpoint. then we ate berger cookies and they were delicious. </P>
<P>ap english- i was so bored. ms. hamill was in a bad mood. i took a grammar test and had no clue what i was doing. then,&nbsp;i worked on an essay that i know nothing about. always wonderful.</P>
<P>after school, i talked to ms. hamill, mr. giordano, mr. fitzpatrick,&nbsp;mrs. hastings, and ms. conti about some scheduling stuff for next week when i'm out doing the annapolis page thingy. should be intresting. i'm kind of nervous though. eek. then, i went to check out the gel electrophoresis with mrs. laun. mr. mcdaniel tagged along to. i told him that we extracted DNA from a braunschweiger (because that's what he calls me). then, we decided that we would make genetically engineered braunschweiger for better tasting lunch meat. mmmmm boy! haha. that was amusing. then, i saw matt mcdaniel and he shared the very exciting news with me that he got a B on his final exam. i was so happy for him. i think he expected me to hate him or be jealous. but, i'm not like that. i was really glad to see him succeed. once you get to know him, he's a great kid. i got a D. that's right. a D. i was bummed. i got a B for the quarter, but a C overall. i am disappointed, but ms. garrott was nice about it. for once. she said that it was totally understandable because i lacked half of the preparation for the course. had i taken college algebra this year, she said, i would have gotten an A for sure. oh well. i'll be okay. i wanted to cry, i guess just to get it out. but, i didn't. who knows? that could come later. **maria- you got an A. you rock!&nbsp;way to go! xin lu got a 100%... but i don't care about her! i am proud of you!**</P>
<P>tomorrow starts the second semester. not much changes for me except for calc. and i am grateful for that. in place of calc. in terms of period scheduling comes ap bio. it switches to first period. and, in place of it for scheduling. i have aiding... for mrs. laun. it's a lot of mrs. laun. but, that's a good thing. there are a few teachers, and i mean a few, who i would be willing to spend 2 periods a day with. she is one of them... along with mr. mcdaniel, mrs. hastings... and.... i'm struggling to find another one... oh, well, mrs. bauer, of course. i babysit her kids, i think i could handle her for two periods. and i really think that's it. maybe ms. sohn, i like her. but overall, i couldn't stand to be with teachers for 2 periods. maybe ms. hamill because i could do some more sucking up. haha. i am good at that with her. </P>
<P>ok, this has turned into un-interesting rambling. i am going to go now. </P>"

"event","<P>Last night, I had my dad drive me over to Lynn's so that I wouldn't have to stay in my house any longer. We hung out for a bit, watched Father of the Bride II, and then talked until 3:00 am. (That is really late for us. I was very proud!) She also taught me how to knit. I attempted to help her perfect her crocheting skills, but I guess its just not natural for her. Haha. But you tried, right Lynn?</P>
<P>This morning, we slept until 11, which is really late for me and fairly late for Lynn. We putzed around the house for a bit, and then decided that it was time to go frolic/play in the snow. So, we got the brilliant idea to walk to Carver's house, which I late clocked to find that it was 2 miles each way. So, I say, ""Oh, they will totally be home. They are always home on Sunday afternoons, and its a snow day which totally increases the chances of them being home."" I was wrong. Bummer. Only Buddy was home. And, I didn't have my key to their house. So, we left them a written message in the snow on the deck picnic table, and left. It was a long walk there and an even longer walk home. But we did it, and I was really proud of us. Some much needed exercise. So, Lynn and I got back to her house and took our showers (<EM>finally!</EM>) and then Lynn drove me over to my house so that I could get my car. Then, I went back to Lynn's and waited for her to come home. After a series of events, she arrived and we played. Haha. Actually, we just talked. Then we ate dinner. Then played and talked some more. Then Amanda came, followed by Amy, followed by Becca, and finally Lacie. We sat around and played Ms. PacMan and some other various old video games on <A href=""http://www.qvc.com/asp/frameset.asp?nest=%2Fasp%2FisItemNumberRedirect.asp&amp;search=SQ&amp;frames=y&amp;referrer=QVC&amp;txtDesc=ms.+pacman&amp;SearchClass="">this</A>. it was enjoyable, but maybe a little boring. So, we all got out our knitting and crocheting stuffs and sat around like old ladies in a nursing home. Lacie played with my hair and I think I fell asleep for a moment. I'm not sure. Then, at 11:10, I left. </P>
<P>Now I am here, rejoicing at the fact that I don't have to go to school tomorrow, but wondering if I'll have to do so on Tuesday. Who knows?</P>"

"event","<P>Last night was Barnyard Olympics at CpR. Aside from stessing on Thursday, it was a stress-free evening for me. I went to school late yesterday so that I could bake brownies for the night. I made about 45. They were really good if I may say so myself. Then, I went to school around 11. I got to AP Bio about 10 minutes into the class which was useless because all we did was practice with gel for the gel electrophoresis and watch a movie on evolution which was totally ridiculous. Then, I went to lunch and was bored. Then, I went to a two hour AP Psychology class and that was awfully boring. We watched the worst movie ever about Freud. It was really bad.</P>
<P>I came home and left again at 3:10ish. I headed out to church and got stuck behind this really slow pick-up truck on New Cut. I hate slow drivers on that road. They drive me absolutely up the wall, and I actually start yelling at them to drive. A little bit of road rage? Nah. Haha. So, I got to church and did some last minute setting up for the barns. Then... I think I sort of just walked around. Oh! I practice my talk with the speaking group. And then me, Kt, Lynn, Amanda, and eventually Carver hung out over at big church talking/ petting eachother/ etc. That was relaxing. I've never felt so laid back before a CpR. It was good. Then, we ate <A href=""http://www.ofoto.com/PhotoView.jsp?collid=77677993606&amp;photoid=97861607706&amp;&amp;refreshkey=1106410105091"">dinner</A>. Brian called me in the middle and it was funny since I was sitting next to Carver. The girls and I got&nbsp;a kick out of it anyway. Lynn came with me to the Pugh's so that we could get a big light for the tractor race. Then, we went inside to get Lynn some meds and Buddy barked at us for about 5 minutes. It was funny. But loud. So, we got back to church and I saw Mike. It was good to see him there and I am really glad he came. </P>
<P>The first event was needle in a haystack. A.K.A.- find the crochet hook that has been dumped in a lot of straw. Needless to say, there were some minor asthma attacks and lots of coughing. Second Event- catch a chicken. Carver, Kt, and I left for this one. I felt really bad for Carver. She took it really hard. I won't share all of the details. Third Event- Grandma's pie eating contest. Absolutely hilarious, even though it made <A href=""http://www.ofoto.com/PhotoView.jsp?&amp;collid=77677993606&amp;photoid=28861607706#"">Stephanie</A> sick for the rest of the night. Fourth Event- Chicken eating contest. Diaz's was laced with hot sauce. That was funny. And, they didn't take the rubber bands off of his wings, so he almost choked on one of those. Fifth Event- Tractor beauty contest and race. That was funny. Except for when a tractor fell over and I thought someone broke their face. Negative. </P>
<P>We headed over to the big church and to our rooms. Matt and I had the <A href=""http://www.ofoto.com/PhotoView.jsp?collid=77677993606&amp;photoid=48861607706&amp;&amp;refreshkey=1106410105091"">sophomores</A>, who continue to amaze me all&nbsp;the time. We ate for a little bit. Matt talked, I talked, Matt talked, and then I lead prayer. Then we ate some more. It was a really good time if I may say so myself. </P>
<P>After our room/grade time, we headed back over to the warehouse. Bonnie and John did an absolutely amazing job with their talks. And, the worsip was unlike anything I had ever experienced. I felt so empowered. That's the best way to describe it. I stayed until about 11:20 or so. Just hanging out once all of the clean-up was done. I got home, and went to bed around 1. </P>
<P>That's about it. Now it is snowing and I am really excited about that. And, I just got a letter from Appalachian State that says I'm being invited into the Honors Program. Tammie was screaming. Haha. It was cute. She says my dad will be happy. I hope it puts him in a better mood. He's not being very happy today. Oh well.</P>
<P>Have a wonderful snowy day!!!</P>"

"event","<P>tonight was the official night of prcrastination. haha. i go home after a treacherous ride home from school. (hello! why didn't we get out early?!?!) email for about 30 minutes. bathroom break for an undisclosed amount of time. putzing. went to mom's to get calc. book that i thought was there. went to the library to meet my favorite calculus buddy maria. studied there. came home, ate dinner, played with kids while doing my ELP, went to print. my printer wasn't working. ah.&nbsp;i have a biology paper due tomorrow and, at this point, i still hadn't written it. which is really ironic because mrs. laun said last week when she gave us the assignment, ""don't wait until wednesday night to find out that your printer is broken."" haha. so, i got to office depot at 8:51pm. they definitely close at 9pm. needless to say, none of the employees were to happy to see another customer. but, at 8:57, this guy came running in through the doors. so, i wasn't the only one. i came home and printed out my ELP and began my biology paper. 4 pages later, i printed it out and finished cutting the brownies i had made earlier. now, i am writing in here. but, i don't have much to say. oh well... its just another waist of time. </P>
<P><lj user=""dizzysympathy"" /> (maria) wrote a really nice ""dedicated to leslie"" entry. i almost wanted to cry. she said i helped her in calculus. by help, i assume she means emotionally... not in math. haha. because wow... we all know how that goes for me. but anyway, it was really nice and i really appreciated it. i only wish my maria entry had been half as good. i'll make it up to her somehow. tee hee hee&nbsp; ::thinks... thinks... thinks... smoke pours out of ears::</P>
<P>ok, i am going to go. i have to go write a letter to rachel, mrs. garrott's daughter. it's going to get me extra credit... and i need it. i have an 80.0%. haha. wow.</P>"

<P>friday night i went babysitting. haha. for these people that i'd never met. they were cute kids. marilyn (5) and ben (2). we played candy land and watched scooby doo. then, they went to bed at 8:30. so, i had until 10:30 to myself. they told m i could get on their computer, so i did. haha. i ordered my digital camera for pick up from circuitcity.com . then, i talked to some people on IM because i hadn't done that in a way long time. then i watched a bit of dances with wolves.</P>
<P>saturday, i slept in until 10. then watched tv, got dressed, etc. mom and i went to panera for lunch and then to circuit city to get my camera. i was so excited.</P>

<P>sunday morning, i got to church at 7:30 am for youth sunday. it was great. exhausting, but great. my talk got changed around a good 3 or 4 times because i kept finding out that people were talking about people that i wanted to talke about. so in the end, i wound up talking about carver. which was great. funny thing, it wasn't even my idea. julia came up to me and went, ""you should talk about carver. really. and it'll only be me and you that know that you love her."" haha. then she said i could talk about her dad. that was funny. especially since i don't know her dad. anyway, i spoke 2nd and 3rd service and it was fine. i left church around 12:50 (i think) and, as usual, carver was behind me driving. (we go the same way) so, i see her picking up her cell phone which is odd because it is like her #1 rule that noone should talk on the phone while they are driving. then my cell phone rings. haha. i was laughing. maybe its not so funny now, but it was then. so, i went over the pugh's for lunch. it was me, brian, jeannie, carver, and carver's grandmother. her grandmother is absolutely adorable. we laughed and ate pizza. then, jeannie and i went downstaird to chill for a bit. but, i got a headache and decided to go home. so, we made plans to get together today. i went home, went upstairs, put my pajamas on and got in bed. i ate a little bit of dinner, and&nbsp;then went back upstairs. kt came over, but i don't&nbsp;remember when. haha. we talked for a bit in my&nbsp;room and then, once michael and my mom had vacated the downstairs, we went down and watched america's sweethearts. i hadn't watched that movie in&nbsp;forever. it was good to watch it&nbsp;again. and kt is cool and fun and i love her. yay kt! then, after she left at 10, i went to bed. it was nice and warm. it also snowed. that was cool. </P>
<P>so, now i am here babysitting josh while tammie&nbsp;has a meeting with carver about the around the country dinner on february 18! which is going to be awesome! woo.&nbsp;hoo. </P>
<P>have a wonderful&nbsp;day!&nbsp;</P>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""much needed vent""><BR>today was a really crappy day. which was disappointing because it started out well and i thought it would be a good day. but no. i ate breakfast at home sitting down for the first time in forever. fruit loops. then, calc. was okay. i still understand it. it was long, but some funny things happen. got my work permit signed and the application for a scholarship. now begins the bad day... go to economics. find out that my grade has dropped 22% from the last time because he gave us that test that he failed and we all failed. with the curve, i got a 59%. my grade went from a 93% to a 71%. what the heck! that made me really mad. then, giordano had the audacity to say, ""all you guys have to do to bring your grades up is do well on the next couple quizzes."" what a freakin idiot! we know that. we study hard. your quizzes are impossible. even you can't pass them. uh. he is such an idiot. even the other teachers say that. then i went to bio. i cooled off a bit and was trying not to think about econ. i went up to a member of my group who had one measly little ditto which would take approx. 90 seconds to do and asked her if she had done it (it was due today). we have 3 people in our group including me. the other 2, and i'm not trying to be mean, have never taken an ap class and frankly should not be in one. gt, maybe. but not ap. so, she hadn't done it. meanwhile, i had completed the whole packet from the lab and the other 2 chi-square analysis papers. so, i had to get it out of her binder while she finished another homework assignment and rush before class began to finish it. i was so pissed. allison told me that i should've toldmrs. laun that i had done all the work, but that seemed kind of snotty. besides, mrs. laun knows my handwriting and she knows how hard i work. so, i guess...whatever. then i went to lunch and found out that i studied for a vocab. test for fourth period rather then the grammar test that we were going to have. wonderful. went to 4th period. mrs. hamill asked me how i was, i told her i had a bad day. she said she was sorry. then she gave me a grammar test. ::feeling the love::. we talked about the transition from medieval to rennasaince. then took an ""oral test"". really stupid. after school, i went to the bathroom and as i was walking past her room she called to me. she came out into the hall and gave me a hug and told me that she hoped i had a good weekend. that was a nice and appreciate gesture. someone almost ran into me on my way home in a parking lot. since when do people with stop signs making left turns think that they have the right-of-way over someone going straight without a stop sign? that was fun. all these seem like minuscule and unimportant events that maybe just didn't go well. but, they add up and these added up to one really crappy day. <BR></lj-cut><BR>i feel better now. i love that just writing about something can make you feel better about it. tonight is orbit! i am way excited. <A href=""http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/PAO/images/fullsize/skylab.orbit.jpg"">sweet picture</A>&nbsp;the projects are going to be absolutely wonderful. thank goodness. that's really all i have to say."

"event","<P>So yeah.... the computer was down all day yesterday. It's a good thing I'm not addicted. It was beautiful out anyway. Lynn and&nbsp;I went to chic fil a and then met Emily g. at Centennial Lake. We walked the lake and saw Doug and Miriam Kook which was, as usual, a joy. We were standing there talking to them and then this guy walked past us and fell over. It was a little weird. Turned out he resprained his ankle for the third time. So, we sort of helped him and his girlfriend. Well, we found them a walking stick. lol. Big help I'm sure. We talked to the Kooks for a bit, but then decided that we needed to get back to Lynn's so that we could heart attack Carver. So, we went to Lynn's and made brownies and cut out paper hearts.<BR><A href=""http://www.perkowitz.net/photo/things/brownies/brownies-2.h900.jpg"" target=_top><IMG height=86 src=""http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:wHc50cKdTcoJ:http://www.perkowitz.net/photo/things/brownies/brownies-2.h900.jpg"" width=114></A>&nbsp;brownies and&nbsp;<A href=""http://www.displaycostume.com/products/100977.jpg"" target=_top><IMG height=86 src=""http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:ZuQ47Lt50LYJ:http://www.displaycostume.com/products/100977.jpg"" width=91></A>&nbsp;paper heart <BR>We headed over to Carver's only to find that Buddy was the only one home. However, this is excellent for a heart attack because then it is a surprise. Hmmm... can we leave the brownies outside? No, an animal will eat them. Wait! I live here! I have a key! Haha. So, we invaded there house and Buddy went beserk on us. I played with him while Lynn and Emily laid out the hearts and brownies. Well, I think Emily spent most of her time looking&nbsp;at Carver's ""fridge-o-fame"". But it doesn't matter. That was enjoyable. I love those two! We went back to Lynn's and waited for Emily's mom to come pick her up. Then Emily got to drive, and that was exciting. Lynn's family invited me to stay for dinner which I very much appreciated. We had really good food. Alaskian King Crab, shrimp, and fettucine with pesto. mmmmm...<BR><A href=""http://www.itrademarket.com/member/s_44805_alaskanredkingcrab912.jpg"" target=_top><IMG height=74 src=""http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:dRFAAXZheVUJ:http://www.itrademarket.com/member/s_44805_alaskanredkingcrab912.jpg"" width=98></A>&nbsp;king crab leg, <A href=""http://www.thethousand.net/pics/scampi/shrimp.jpg"" target=_top><IMG height=86 src=""http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:wrVyn7L59HQJ:http://www.thethousand.net/pics/scampi/shrimp.jpg"" width=114></A>&nbsp;shrimp, and <A href=""http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/foodday/fd0597/art/fetpesto.gif"" target=_top><IMG height=86 src=""http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:6ih5WhhMrNMJ:http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/foodday/fd0597/art/fetpesto.gif"" width=77></A>&nbsp;fettucine with pesto.<BR>it was wonderful! after dinner, Lynn and I went and hung out in her room and acted really silly. Seriously, we were so weird. We took some goofy pictures, laughed way too much, fell off the bed a lot, and kind of freaked her mom out. Then we went to Safeway and bought some icer cream. It was good. I got Godiva with caramel filled chocolate hearts in vanilla ice cream. i left it at lynn's though. For the next time I come over perhaps.<BR>I got home around 10:30 or so. I did some homework and then I went to bed.</P>
<P>This morning, I got up and went to second service. I sat with Brian and Carver and I got to see Michelle, Brianna, and Olivia. That was fun! Clive Calver spoke... need i say more. He was amazing. And he has a British accent which is flippin awesome! But his sermon was absolutely fantastic! Wow. There aren't even words. (I could put a picture of him up here because there are lots of him online. He just resigned as the president of World Relief in September and he's written a few books, so I guess random pictures of him just show up online.)<BR>I decided to skip CpR and come home and do homework. I got home and figured that I should get an entry out of the way for the day before I do my homework. Or else, I'll just think about what to write in the entry, rather then my homework. So, here is the entry, and now I am off to do my homework. Have a wonderful day!</P>"

"event","<P>so, what shall the purpose of this entry be? i haven't really decided that yet. but i think it will decide for itself. </P>
<P>i haven't picked a word to describe today because i don't think that there is one. today was so many things. it was wonderful, it was torture, it was really happy, it was really sad, i was up, and i was down. i guess they all sort of seem to balance eachother out, but then again, not really. it just made for an emotionally lousy end to 2004. the day began with my sleeping in. well, until about 9. which is really good for me. so that was nice.&nbsp;i ate breakfast and watched law and order: svu. believe it or not, this was a good start to a day. i headed out to church at 12 to set up for the bash. it was ok. not many people showed up. i was a little disappointed. carver and i were talking about it at lunch. it's hard to pour your heart into something and then have people who either obviously take advantage of you or just flat out ignore you. i'm not saying that to sound selfish, because i don't serve there so that people will notice and i do serve for the people. but, i feel like a lot of the people at cpr are bumps on logs and it makes me sad. (however, there are some amazing people there who share in pouring their hearts into the ministry. don't get me wrong.) anyway, carver asked me to go get jeannie and take her to michelle's house. so, i went to my surrogate house and let buddy out while i waited for jeannie to get ready. took jeannie to michelle's. carver told me she'd take me out to lunch. so at this point, i'm excited. i hadn't been out on a date with her in forever. i was needing it. so i come back and i am informed that carver went to get pizza. i'm like, ""hmm... not the date i imagined..."" so i am saying that to kt and carver comes up behind me and goes, ""can we still go out to lunch?"" i was really glad. kt can vouch for that. so, we got to red robin around 3:25 or so. we split 2 appetizers. they were yummy. i had never been there before, so i just let carver order for us. she did a good job. we talked a bit, but not about anything monumental. just the usual, which was good. i needed it... a lot. (oh! somewhere in the middle of all of this, my mom calls to tell me that my grandfather fell down the stairs, is in the hospital, and is having sugery on his knee. bummer) so, carver and i finish lunch and i stop by giant on my way home to get soda for the brettschneider's new years eve party. come home, shower, pretty myself up, eat more food, talk with friends of the family, play two rounds of dutch blitz, run to my mom's to get a senior picture for carver, go to the warehouse, realize how tight my clothes are due to the mass amounts of food i've eaten, and then dance like an idiot... aka a white girl. we watch some relaly weird interpretive dances. jenn and i were very confused. then, people give awards. carver gave me, amanda, and diaz a 3-way award for being dependable. amanda broke it into 3 pieces for us. i got the base. i told carver it was the most special third of an award i've ever gotten. it is. then, minor happening, i had an anxiety attack and almost passed out. well, i may have. i know that i was standing, and then i was sitting. couldn't breathe, felt like puking, shaking, etc. the usual symptoms. the culprit: i started thinking about all of the stuff i have to do. homework, stuff, and more stuff. it's sort of weird. i can't list any of the stuff that i actually have to do, but its like this looming fear that i can't get over. it would be okay with me if jesus came back today. that's selfish, but right now, at 1:41 am on January 1, 2005. it is how i am feeling. so, i went outside for some air and then sat down with carver. she held my hand and lacie gave me a massage. those were both very comforting. i love them. (lacie and carver, not the handholding and massaging.) i had felt unproductive the whole night, so in hopes of getting my mind off of things, i did some cleaning up stuff. it was successful, even though i still felt like falling over, or puking. now i am here.</P>
<P>i wish i could reflect on 2004 like some other livejournalers have been doing, but i'm just not sure. it's all such a blur... i guess i could pick a few events:<BR>-lisence... february 19th and still going strong with no violation of any type<BR>-junior prom... was an experience. not one that i remember with extreme fondness, but one that i'm glad to have had.<BR>-first summer job(s)... working for almarie was wonderful and working for the pughs was fantastic<BR>-new york... pushed me, definitely<BR>-TNTs... i learned a lot about myself and the people that i am friends with. something different happened each thursday for me<BR>i'm sure i'm missing a ton of things. but those are what come to mind when i think of 2004. and even then its a stretch. i have a hard time remembering a span as long as a year. am i missing something? i'd like to say some philosophical reason for it like, ""i don't want to live in the past. the future is mine for the taking."" but that's just a load of crap, and i really just can't remember anything that happened to me worth posting. is that a bad sign? oh well.<BR><BR>it's 1:49 now. i am beyond tired. but&nbsp;i have no interest in going to bed. i can't do homework because i'm too tired, but i can't do anything else productive for that same reason. and now,&nbsp;i am just rambling. which can't be of interest to anyone. so, i will close out this entry with a ""happy new year"" to all of you.</P>"

""hmm..."" i say to myself. ""i should fix that."" i finish my shower, grab a dixie cup, unscrew the little drain thing.... yum. 3 dixie cups full of wet hair later, and i am in my own personal hell. yes, this has been accumulated, but only over the last month and a hlaf and i don't live here full-time. so, that's pretty extreme. surprisingly though, i 1) didn't throw up, and 2) didn't become depressed for the rest of the day. i guess i'm getting used to it again. i don't know. it's not that it didn't make me sad, but i can't let it ruin my day. nonetheless, at that moment, before actually thinking about it, it was my personal hell.<BR></lj-cut><BR>my mom and i went to the dermatologist to see if anything new had been released for treatment. but we had to wait a long time, even though we had an appointment and we just didn't think it was worth it. so, 45 minutes later we left and went to panera. then we went to the mall and i picked out a little cardigan to wear on new years eve. i think its really cute. then we walked around for a bit. i found a sweater from the limited that i want, but i didn't have my gift certificate with me. however, i am going back to the mall tonight, so i am going to get it then. yay! it's <EM>really</EM> cute! all of the sweaters there are 50% off. that is amazing! woo. i love that store. i think almost everything i own is from there. then i came home and i have been online since then. well, actually, i called the lady i'm supposed to babysit for tomorrow. i want to change the time because i would much rather hang out with carver. plans for tomorrow with this lady got really screwed up because she is a flipping whacko and i can't stand her children. i didn't even tell&nbsp;her i could do it!!! she called and left a message saying, ""i'm just calling to confirm our time for thursday"" what the heck!?!?! ah! i want to scream. i left a message for her. i bet she doesn't call back. arg. anyway, now i am mad. <BR>&nbsp;i am going to go do some more writing. have a wonderful wonderful evening!</P>"

<P>-i went to see the phantom of the opera. it was amazing. i want to see it again and again and again! i bought the soundtrack today. i am listening to it right now. amazing. it's not too opera-y.</P>

<P>my mom got the details for our italy trip. 6 cities, 6 days. Rome, Venice, Florence, Tuscany, Pisa and one more I can't spell<BR>i cannot wait! it's going to be stinkin awesome!</P>
<P>that is really all i have to say.&nbsp;i can't think of anything exciting.</P>
<P>oh! (this isn't really exciting, but it is a point)- i asked mrs. laun if she needed an aide next semester 3rd period and she like went balistic on me. haha. it was cute. she really wants to get me as a peer mentor/aide because 3rd period next semester is her standard class and wow, they need some help. hopefully that will work out. as of now, next semester looks like this:<BR>A Day&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bday<BR>1) AP Biology (Laun)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) AP Biology (Laun)<BR>2) Band (Wharton/Skinner)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) AP Economics (Giordano)<BR>3) Mentor/Aide (Laun)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Mentor/Aide (Laun)<BR>4) AP Psychology (Fitzpatrick)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) AP English (Hamill)</P>
<P>please notice the lack of calculus there. i cannot wait for that class to be over. but, i will miss maria and matt. i'll probably never see them except for&nbsp;in the hallway. that makes me a little sad, but i definitely hate calc.</P>
<P>most odd/idiotic story of the day to close out this entry:<BR>mr. giordano made up a test for us today and claimed to use the hardest questions that he could find. after making it up, he took it himself and got... that's right... a 64. he got a freaking D on his own test and then expected us to take it and do well. what the heck?!?! i have no clue what his deal is. but, i found out that he is leaving next year and mr. hipsley is coming back. (he is great!) so, juniors, you can take AP Econ. without fear! </P>"

(we stopped and ate for about 1.5 hours.) this morning, we woke up around 8 and got ready and headed over to grove around 10:30. had my interbiew at 11. went and bought a sweatshirt. woo. began our ride home. we got home... finally... around 5:20. i changed, scarfed dinner, and then kt, kelly, tammie, donna, and i went to the michael w. smith christmastime tour with the katinas and point of grace. it was awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><A href=""http://www.wrbs.com/page.cfm?PageID=334""><IMG alt=""Christmas with Michael W.

"event","<P>i'll start on friday which seems forever ago but that's where i left off...</P>
<P><STRONG>friday: </STRONG>cpr. not much to say about that. it was good though.</P>
<P><STRONG>saturday:</STRONG> olivia's 8th b-day party at the bowling alley. christmas shopping (almost done!) sonja's for dinner and movie night</P>
<P><STRONG>sunday:</STRONG> i wound up spending the night at sonja's so i came home in the morning to get dressed for church. did my economics notes. went to church. came home and did calc. homework like a banchee. went to olivia's piano recital and then out for her actual b-day. came home and worked on more homework like a banchee. although, i'm not sure if i got anything done. i was maybe just spinning my wheels?</P>
<P><STRONG>monday:</STRONG> woke up. took a shower. threw up due to loss of hair. went to school. got through calc.... barely. called tammie from homeroom. cried to mrs. laun. cried to mrs. hamill. left school at 9:25 am. came home and watched white christmas/ate lots of food. got in bed and slept for the rest of the day. went to mom's for dinner. gina came to visit. it was good to see her and it made my day a bazillion times better. came back to dad's to decorate christmas tree. finished beowulf essay around 12:00. went to bed.</P>
<P><STRONG>tuesday:</STRONG> went back to school. got an A on my calc. day went by fairly quickly. tutoring after school. came home and did homework. went to d-team at ann's. i was totally not focused, nor had i done the study. i should've just not gone. but, finally i seemed to get a bit focused. it was, overall, a good night. talked to wonderful sonja on the way home. have i mentioned that she is amazing? oh my gosh. she is.</P>
<P><STRONG>today:</STRONG> went to school. almost fell asleep in calc. i have no idea what we learned, so i'm not sure how i'm going to do the homework. economics was actually interesting. i finally understand a topic and find it to be interesting. in bio we started breeding our flies. that was fun. first we ""napped"" them with fly nap. a.k.a. put them to sleep. then, we looked at them under microviewers (a little bit different from a microscope, but basically serving the same purpose) to sex them. a.k.a. divide them into male and female. then we put a few of each gender into some tubey thingys so that they can&nbsp;reproduce and make out F2 generation. it's going to be pretty&nbsp;sweet. english wasn't too too unbearable. i'm not really stressing about school. in some ways this is good... in other ways this is bad. it depends on whether you look at it from an academic level or an emotional level. but, i have all A's and B's, so i'm really actually fine. after school, i went to tutoring for a bit and helped this kid with punnett squares... which i like a lot. then i went to talk to ms. conti since i haven't done that in a while. it was a good talk. mrs. laun talked with us for a&nbsp;bit too. i like them a lot. all in all, a much better day then the previous two.&nbsp;</P>
<P>now, i have to go do some stuff for the nhs meeting tomorrow. and some homework. and some other stuff. and then take dinner to my grandparents.</P>
<P>sorry this entry was boring... i really didn't have anything significant or important to talk about. although, it is my journal. so&nbsp;i guess i don't really have to apologize.</P>"

(southern for freaking out). i only hope&nbsp;i can get it all together again in time. hopefully, it will end up there tomorrow. but, just in case, i have to go get all of my stuff as fast as i can. crap.&nbsp;i thought i was getting ahead by applying early, but now i'm just behind. hopefully the same thing didn't happen at grove. i'm calling tomorrow to make sure they got everything.&nbsp;i hope they did. ah! this stress is not needed. i was having a great week. that went out the window. </P>
<P>in other news, today was good. besides the above event. school was pretty uneventful. my dad had surgery today on his hand. he's semi out of commission although he keeps trying to do all this stuff which makes me mad. set-up, i think, went well. there were a lot of people there. and the warehouse looks cool. i can't wait for tomorrow night. i actually prepared a talk too. (last time i spoke i went very unprepared). this time is different. i am pleased with it, i like public speaking, and i can't wait to have the christmas party! woo. (maria, i hope you can come. it's going to be awesome!)</P>
<P>now, i am going to go crochet as an outlet. i really want to do something hat requires very little thought to calm my nerves. i am way high strung and still shaking from when my dad told me about the situation. </P>
<P>have a wonderful evening.</P>"

(maybe not diseased, but to some extent.) or, maybe they suffer from someone else's mistake. either way, they have to be in need of some love/care/compassion. <BR>this has kind of just been a ""thinking out loud"" period for me. but, i will say that the wheels in my head are turning.</P>
<P>in other news, d-team was really good last night. it was at ann's and she cooked my favorite chicken. (i asked her to.) haha. yummy. afterwards, lynn and i made a surprise trip to michael's and i started crocheting last night. it's been a while, but my scarf is coming along well. it's a pretty coral color. woo. <BR>today was good too. calc. was boring and&nbsp;i almost fell asleep. band was... bandy. bio was cool. we looked at some fruit flies for an upcoming experiment in which we will breed them and cross-breed them (i can't wait!),did some more punnet squares, talked about blood types, and counted corn to see if we could figure out what genotypes the parents and grandparents were. yes, corn has male and female. it's pretty exciting and interesting. i enjoy it. then i went to psych to take the test. but, <STRONG>we got out of school 1 hour early! </STRONG>so i only answered 15 or so questions. haha. yeah... power outages all over baltimore county, so the whole county got out. did c-ville lose power? of course not, but who cares?!?! haha. that was good.<BR>tonight, i shall do my homework, crochet, take dinner to g-mom and g-dad, eat dinner, crochet, crochet and crochet. i can't wait! haha</P>"

<P>maria and i hung out this morning before calc. it was fun. she is katie's sister. that was definitely established. haha. then, there was calc. and i still understand what i'm doing and i actually don't mind it that much. i mean, it's not my favorite, but mrs. garott told me i wasn't going to understand it. she lied. mwahahahaha. i proved her wrong. yay. then there was band. and it was fast, thank goodness. i drew some more pictures on the music. that is fun. then ap bio. we ate my chocolate covered rice krispie treats which were, as stated above, excellent. then, we played jepoardy to review for our test on monday. my team lost. haha. not that i care. then, mrs. laun got out the berger cookies that she brought and we finished watching outbreak. it was good! then, in psych, we took notes. as usual. </P>
<P>after school, i carried some tables down to the cafeteria for the flea market tomorrow. and, then i realized that i had to pee really badly. so, i went and got ms. conti's bathroom key from her. when i went to return it to her, we started talking. this was at 2:45. at <STRONG>5 </STRONG>pm, i finally looked at the clock. i had no clue what time it was. it was a really good conversation. we pretty muched talked about everything. which was good. i'm sorry that so many people think they don't like her. they really don't know her. i used to be one of the people that didn't think i liked her. but now i know her, and she's pretty cool. anyway, that was good.</P>
<P>went and got a pizza, came home, and now i am babysitting for the little brettschneiders. they are sitting behind me on the floor playing together. i can't believe it! they are playing so nicely.</P>
<P>in other news, having nothing to do with today... i got accepted to the Annapolis Page program. (sabrina, i've been meaning to tell you this.) i suppose i'll do it. haha. i'm not sure when i'll want to miss a week of school, but i'll fit it in somewhere. woo hoo. mrs. hastings was proud of me. so, i was proud of myself. i was selected to, ""represent my county."" haha. out of all of baltimore county applicants, they chose me. woo hoo. but why? lol. whatever, it looks good on my resume. </P>

(which was a very good thing because i did not understand it at all). then they came back and we learned something new which, as soon as i do my hw tonight, will confuse me even more. <U>ap econ.-</U> we took notes and i kind of/ sort of understood what we were doing. that was good. but the period seemed really long. <U>ap bio.-</U> i thought rachel j. was going to get into a fight with mrs. laun. rachel was in a <EM>really</EM> bad mood and she was yelling at mrs. laun. mrs. laun was trying to keep from laughing at her. i, however, didn't hold my laughter in. then, rachel was rude to nick and i was like, ""woah. calm down!"" anyway, that was... interesting. i am making chocolate covered rice krispie treats for that class. i am going to reinstate snack fridays. it shall be yummy... i hope. <U>ap english-</U> probably failed the beowulf test, talked in our groups for a bit, wasn't really paying attention until mrs. hamill started talking. i'm not sure why people hate her with such a passion. i think her ""teaching"" method is a little out there, but i really like her. if she was a little more organized and handed papers back, she would be a great teacher. she knows<EM> everything</EM> about what she's teaching, you have to atleast admit that. </P>
<P>anyway, after school i went to the library and the grocery store. i got a book and rice krispies and marshmallows. the book, mrs. dalloway by virginia woolf, is for my independent reading. the rice krispies and marshmallows are for... duh... rice krispie treats. yum. i can't wait to eat them. </P>

<P><lj-cut text=""my bad day""><BR>in other news, today was pretty bad. i went to bed late last night. i made myself hyper in calc. by eating candy corn. mrs. garott was not exceptionally mean to me today, but she was pretty harsh to kathryn for about 5 straight minutes. i kept saying it was nice to not be picked on and to see mrs. garott pick on someone else, but that's not true. i felt bad for kathryn, just because i know how she felt. embarassed. anyway, by the time the candy corn high wore off in homeroom, i was crashing. i almost fell asleep in band and i was just sad. about a lot of things. then i got to bio and mrs. laun wasn't there because her daughter fell down the stairs and twisted her ankle and mrs. laun had to take her to the hospital. (mind you, her daughter is like 22.) so, we watched this movie called outbreak. not all of it... but it's actually really good. mrs. laun came back towards the end of class. i kept trying to be happy, but it just wasn't working to well. i actually started crying, but i was really good at concealing it this time. at least, the crying part. not the sad part. mrs. laun knew i was sad. she asked me about it. i told her the truth, that i wasn't doing okay. i got a sympathetic look, which was actually nice. i almost left. but i had a psych test. so, i went to class and took it. after school, as i was walking past mrs. hamill's room, she came out of the door and called me over. she told me that i was the only student to get a perfect score on the biblical archetype test. i was really excited. (sadly, it made my day.) i told her, ""well, i like the bible. so that's awesome."" haha. i laugh at myself for saying that so cornily. and then, after i talked to her for a bit, i went to do some stuff for nhs. i got to work on mrs. laun's new dell laptop. i want one. i heart dells. and windows xp. they are both so pretty. anyway, i talked to ms. conti for a bit. that was cool, because i like her. then mrs. laun joined in and they were nice to me. i left about the same time as mrs. laun and so we rode down in the elevator, which was nice for my knee. we were talking about the whole thing with me and my mom and she was telling me about emily, her step-daughter (who happens to live up the street from me), and how much trouble she has with her mom. we have a really similar story actually. but, she was really encouraging and i really appreciated it. then i went to the hospital and did hw while i waited for my appointment. came home... did more hw... ate dinner... finished the grove city app. after losing it once... did some more hw.... updating while doing more hw... and then i have more to do. i should really not be updating. oh well. <BR></lj-cut><BR>so, in conclusion... 2 high points in the midst of this very bad day: (1) getting a perfect on the test in mrs. hamill's class and her pointing it out to me and making me feel special, which was very important after the day i'd had, and (2) getting some much needed and much applicable encouragement from mrs. laun.</P>

($540,000) to be exact. that's definitely not what we paid for it. haha. back in 1989. oh well, houses in c-ville are crazy insane priced now. </P>

<P>anyway, i want it. </P>
<P>in other news, i had a very productive weekend. i got a lot of stuff done. thank goodness. i'll probably do my atlantis project for hamill tonight. luckily, i read beowulf and did my bio thingy yesterday. it felt good to not be bogged down with tons of hw today. instead, i finished almost all of my college stuff. i should be submitting within the next 3 days. i've added Baylor to the list. in Texas. i really like it... a lot. so, the list is now: <A href=""appstate.edu"">appalachian state university</A>, <A href=""baylor.edu"">baylor university</A>, <A href=""gcc.edu"">grove city college</A>, and <A href=""unc.edu"">unc-chapel hill</A>.<BR>i am so excited to leave!!!!! woo!!!! </P>
<P>i'm also excited to go to school tomorrow. i'm not sure why... but i am. with the exception of calculus, none of my classes are particularly awful right now. english is pretty boring and mrs. hamill can be a little condescending, but i don't really care if she thinks i anaylze poetry the wrong way. economics is going okay since i'm understanding things and since i'm not as ""well endowed"" as some of the other girls, mr. giordano doesn't stare at me... which is good. psych. is funny as usual. and, i am still loving ap bio. band is musical, what else can i say about it? </P>
<P>i had something that i wanted to write about. but now i forget. ann said something really nice to me today.&nbsp;i love her. she's awesome. as a matter of fact... the snowflakes are just awesome in general. i was writing a to do list on my snowflake notepad today and i was thinking about how much i love them. thanks girls! you rock my mittens off!!</P>
<P>if i think of that other thing, i'll come back to this.</P>"

"event","<P>today... i was tired. i wound up going to bed around 2. fun times. i really wasn't that tired last night and it hasn't really caught up with me today other then me acting a little weird/hyper. **calc.- test. probably got&nbsp;a D. **ap econ.- substitute. your's truly got in trouble. can you imagine that? everyone in the class was like, ""what the heck?!"" the next to me asked me to explain a part of the packet to him and so i started talking and the sub was like, ""you! move over there"" he made me sit all by myself and wouldn't let me explain why i was talking. that was really stupid.** ap bio- startted looking at leaf cells under the microscope. did some coloring. ** ap english- further analyzing The Seafarer (poem), grammar test, mrs. hamill telling me that my lack of sleep is effecting my mood. (which is true, but she didn't have to say it in front of the class and in the tone that she did.) i talked to ms. conti after school about some AFG and NHS stuff. it was ghetto. i was supposed to be talking to mrs. laun about it, but she is just so busy and so stressed out that i couldn't bring myself to do it. oh well. i've gotta be at school at 7 am tomorrow morning. it's like&nbsp;a school day. i'm going to think it's a monday or something. oh well.</P>
<P>in other news... i wrote a bunch of NHS thank you notes last night and delivered them today. i had to give one to ms. hickman, an a.p., so i did. she sent mrs. laun and ms. conti and email saying how wonderful it was to be appreciated as an administrator and how sincere i was and how great she thought that note was and how she's going to keep it. it was a really sweet email. ms. conti let me read it. i was like, ""oh... she is so cute!"" haha. that was nice to hear. </P>
<P>now i must go. cpr all night. i have got to do some serious attitude adjusting in the car on the way there. my attitude right now is craaaaaaapy. i just want to say ewww to myself. ""ewww""</P>
<P>have wonderful weekends.</P>
<P>nhs people- if you could come to the craft fair and help, it would be amazing! from either 7-8:30 or 2-4. thanks so much! (it'll count as a tutoring)</P>"

"event","<P>so... for those of you who read the last post's cut... i did it. i actually wound up talking to mrs. laun and ms. conti about it. it was really good. of course, i got the ""oh gosh. i'm so sorry to hear that"" line. haha. but hey, that's nice to hear every now and then. but then... ms. conti and&nbsp;i just sort of kept talking about stuff. which was a little weird at first because&nbsp;i used to be semi-afraid of her. haha. but, she's actually pretty cool. (i think you have to be on her good side, which i 'm pretty sure i am, in order for her niceness to come out.) turns out she's a christian. so that was awesome. we talked about stuff like that. (i'm too tired to go into detail. you can ask me when it's not midnight.) so, that made my afternoon good. (after the nhs meeting which made me mad). then i came home for a record 5 minutes, left and went to set-up, made arts and crafts projects with kt, went to the drive-thru at chic fil a, took carver home, got to school around 6:30, left around 9:30, started my homework at 10, semi-finished at 11:45, wrote NHS thank you notes, now i'm posting. which is silly because i am crap tired.(not sure what ""crap tired"" means... but ya know, i'm weird). breakfast bunch in calc. tomorrow. should be fun. eating donuts provided by yours truly and studying calculus. woo! i'm so tired. </P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.rockitoforegon.com/birdimages/15a.jpg"">&nbsp;we're starting photosynthesis in bio. fun lab tomorrow. hopefully i won't fall asleep. haha. </P>

<P><lj-cut text=""me complaining about people in nhs""><BR>today at the nhs meeting. i got really mad. mrs. laun got mad too. i could see it in her face. i think i actually turned red. i've been doing that lately. it brings a whole new meaning to wearing your emotions. i wear anger on my face apparently. anyway, people are dumb. really... you're in nhs because you're an active student (character, scholarship, service, leadership... the 4 pillars... kind of important!) out of approximately 120 members, 5 of us showed up tonight, including me. that is just wrong. i'm sorry. it makes me really mad. i know there's that 80-20 rule. (80% of the people do nothing, 20% of the people do all the work), but 5 isn't even 20%. it just makes me mad that something that mrs. laun, ms. conti, and i invest so much into is just another thing to put on your resume. god love mrs. laun. she is so flippin busy because she's department chair and she got so upset... but she held it in and even got me to calm down. anyway, i just needed to rant about how people upset me. and... the fact that not even one of the other 3 officers came upset me too. i expect as much of them as i do of myself. i know people are busy. it's not like i sat around all week waiting for today... or even like i sat today. whatever. i guess i should just accept the fact that people slack off. i do it too sometimes. it's just the way it is. thus ending my rant for this evening.<BR></lj-cut><BR>-thanks to those of you who showed up. mrs. laun and i decided to reward you by counting it as a tutoring session. now you've already finished one tutoring session without even tutoring. congrats! and thank you soooo incredibly much!</P>

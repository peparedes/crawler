"event","I posted this last year, and this year I decided to go back and edit it a bit.

October is breast cancer awareness month. This is HUGELY personal to me. My mother died of breast cancer. Ladies, check your boobs. Feel 'em up. Check the texture. This is important. There are two kinds of breast cancer. One kind forms lumps and is fairly easy to catch with regular mammograms. The second kind, which my mother had, is called inflammatory breast cancer, or IBC. This cannot be detected with a mammogram. This cancer forms sheets between the fatty tissue of the breast.It is formed by blocking the lymph nodes in the breast. It has some signs that everyone should know. Occasionally, the nipple may become crusty or turn inward. The breast may become swollen and red, sometimes doubling in size. This is cause by fluid backing up in the breast tissue because the lymph glands are blocked.  Often, the only way to catch it is to note the texture of the skin. It may feel like an orange peel. This cancer is usually FATAL because it is only ever caught at stage 3 and 4. If you are a size C cup and up, you are more at risk for IBC. This kind of cancer also will metastacise. Because it can spread to the lymph glands under your arms, this means it gets into the blood stream and goes to other organs, tissues, and even bones. If you are thirty years old or up, and have never had a mammogram, GET ONE!!!!!!! Don't put it off because it makes you uncomfortable or because you are scared. Suck it up and get it done. This is your life. And corpse? So not in fashion. If you think there might be something wrong, go to the doctor. If they don't address your worries, go to another one. You know your body, so you know if something is not right. Stay healthy. Exercise, eat right, don't drink too much. These things can help reduce the risk of cancer. Be aware. If you are diagnosed, get in with a support group. You'll feel better if you can share with other women who have had the same thing happen. Do the research. Trust your doctors, but know what they want to do. Most importantly, be proactive! So check the titties. Feel 'em up. And if you have a significant other, get 'em to help. Hey, it's fun AND healthy!"

"event","So I got in a scooter wreck, and broke my wrist. This was in Taiwan. I went to the doctor a week later, he said,&nbsp; &quot;You wrist very bad. Need surgery in two weeks.&quot; I was shocked and asked if I could do the surgery at home in the States. Because of the way health care in Taiwan is set up, if you are in the hospital, the nurses don't take care of you like in the US. about 80% of the things a nurse would do, your family does instead. So, I went back to the States. Got in on Wednesday, saw the doctor. He was NOT&nbsp;HAPPY about my wrist. Said it should have had surgery&nbsp; a week ago.I apparently powedered the bone and a spur was coming off the front and sliding down. Asked if I had osteoperosis. I'm 29. I drink milk daily. He asked if any family had osteoperosis. My Grandmother did. Said it could be a DNA thing. Scheduled my op for Sunday. I stayed in the hospital overnight because of anesthesia and pain meds. I now have a &quot;cutter&quot;scar and a metal plate in my wrist. Airports are gonna be fun.

My family lived with cancer for 11 or so years. In my senior year of high school, my maternal grandmother also died of cancer. I&nbsp;had a hand in taking care of.....everything.&nbsp; I quite literally spent my 18th birthday in a graveyard, burying my grandmother.

One that really makes me scream, and not in a good way is this little gem. Mistaking the word ""prostrate"" for ""prostate"". Every time I see this, I have the insane urge to whip out my Webster's and beat the offender over the head with it*. For future reference, ""prostate"" is an adjective. It is the gland, in males, at the base of the urethra. It is part muscle and part gland, which helps sperm to move and be fertile. In contrast, ""prostrate"" can be used as either a verb or adjective. As a verb, it means to cast (oneself) face down on the ground in humility, submission, or adoration, to lay flat, as on the ground, to throw down level with the ground, to overthrow, overcome, or reduce to helplessness, to reduce to physical weakness or exhaustion. As an adjective it means lying flat or at full length, as on the ground, lying face down on the ground, as in token of humility, submission, or adoration, overthrown, overcome, or helpless: a country left prostrate by natural disasters, physically weak or exhausted, submissive,	utterly dejected or depressed; disconsolate, Botany. (of a plant or stem) lying flat on the ground. (yes,I do realize the formatting and grammar is lousy. )

It's all achy and tingly from my elbow to my middle finger. WTH? No, seriously, this is a bit worrysome. It's my right arm, and that is my dominant hand.

"event","So I realized most people's emails are no longer active, so I'm posting here.  For anyone in LA, I have a non-paying acting gig.  A friend is looking for a college-age guy to act in a short film.  You will be given copy, and it would be great to add to your resume.  Also, the producer's wife is an agent.  So it can't hurt.  Please let me know if you are interested, it's a good experience.

Thanks!
me

"event","So had an interview, but I have no experience...apparently they want something a little more, but the guy was jaw-dropping gorgeous and he wanted to call me in first based on my resume...so cross everything for me, it'd be a good fit.

So I spent yesterday on a Harley.  WTF is happening to me. Sometimes my life just surprises me.  I feel like it's one big rave.  And the new man is so unexpected.  I cannot even explain that situation.  OK, Tom call me when you have a moment, I think I'm surprising someone at work for a bit, but latro I will be around.  I couldn't get the phone when you called, freeway driving blows.

Hmmm.  Just hmmm."

Other than that, I am facing a disasterously messy apt which I should be packouter ing up, but enjoying Boston and movies too much right now.  Wednesday could be a potentially strange day, but Thursday will be full of sad good-byes to Boston, my sweet little apt, and lots of memories and growing up.  Then it's back to the 'Burgh and off to LA to start a quasi-real life.  Applying for internships is so like college applications, waiting and hoping someone loves you out there.  So cross your fingers for me.  I've been living four different lives this year - Boston/Emerson, BSU, family, the Playhouse.  Weird memories floating around wherever I am.  Not really grasping any terra firma.  So this big move is all about letting go to whatever lingers of the past.  Somedays, however, I wish I could just wake up to that little, shy girl again and start over.  These days, the highs are in the sky, and the lows are darker than ever.

"event","Just a nice, quiet ""Sarah evening"".  A day of closure perhaps.  The big sign that it's time to move on:  my favorite video store went out of business.  First my bookstore and now the only video store around that had my type of films.  THe ones that got me through this year.  Tear.  Everything here is just kind of wrapping itself up w/o me.  Friendships are dwindling which makes it so much easier for me to hop a plane outta here.  
A friend here held my chin one night, staring into my eyes, and asked me what I thought when I looked in the mirror.  A tres loaded question.  I didn't want to answer him honestly.  But tonight I looked again.  I think I'm starting to see.  I thought a little bit about growing up after a Chinese-ing night  and who I was at BSU, etc.  I unrecognizably that person.  I needed those two years to get the college experience out of my system safely.  There is no way I could act like that again, and I wouldn't retrace most of those steps for a million dollars.  I needed the city here to grow up.  With my friend and everything here, I think reality hit me.  I still love and glamourize a lot of the same things and emotions, but there are events and actions that just can never be relived.  Even though I miss the excitement and carelessness of never feeling like I had to be responsible, I don't know if I could do all that again.  Now, I am more frustrated watching other people following those footsteps.  But at the same time, there are always a few thrills I want to kick before my game is over.    
Like my acting teacher said you sometimes need a year to cry, or laugh, or be lazy, or whatever you're feeling.  I couldn't have needed that advice more this year.  I woke up this morning and felt really happy.  And I still do now.  I should be sad for good-byes, but I am starting to get excited to move on.  I think I would be content the rest of my life with never being settled.
Funny how the people you jump to lean on, sometimes lean back too.  How fate's hand maybe has worked some good in my life.  Right now I am having a tasty nostalgic night.  If all I had left in life were the memories I have now, I would be a happy kiten.  Maybe we're not forgotten after all..."

"event","Spend a very Sarah casual evening.  Just felt like either being glammed to the hilt or being in my dad's old dress shirt and a blanket.  Opted for the second one.  Saving up for a big weekend next week...my liver probably deserves a break.  It's very odd being where I am emotionally right now.  I think I finally feel myself growing up.  As I sat watching previews for films, I realized I cannot relate to teen movies anymore.  High school, what was that?  College is almost a shadow.  It is incomprehensible to be actually almost on my own.  Buying grownup heels was a great first step.  But reading some entries, especially one of Natalie's in particular, reminds me just how real I am sometimes.  I guess it's funny thinking about ""dirty laundry"", how little secrets are so confusing.  But at the same time, this is me.  Maybe it'll change, maybe it won't.  Some habits, etc are just part of who I am.  Right now I am feeling so much pressure, not in the immediate sense, but in the sense of how Emerson grads are major VPs after like 5 yrs, making millions.  What if I don't want that, what if I do want to rent studios the rest of my life and just think.  Why is that such an anomaly?
      Watched some Sex and the City tonight.  It's growing on me.  Especially the later ones.  Once I can cut through some of the superficiality.  There was an episode where Carrie deals (ever slightly) with how her father walked out and it screwed her up w/ men.  My friends totally agreed with that, but then why do I have the perfect father and family life and I am such a black sheeep.  I can count at least 3 significantly messed up relationships in the past year alone.  So where's the explanation?  My father's amazing and so giving and nice.  How am I looking for the antithesis and yet the same thing he is, but unfortunately in the same age range?  Where did that all start?  In a way, though, tonight I realized I get to have a Mr. Big.  I get to have a guy who I can still call when everyone else is asleep and leave nice voicemails, etc.  And who I can still talk for an hour plus on the phone with, but I don't think it's love.  It might have been at one point, but it's settled into comfortability.  And yet, when I want to grab a drink out, there's no one I want to call.  
    Good points of today, I recognized the time to move on.  So as of July-ish, I'm officially out of Boston to home to LA.  Done with this scene and college as I know it.  And I don't think I could be happier.  But still, there are those moments (a few tonight) when I can't imagine surviving the real world alone because sometimes it seems an impossible feat.

Sometimes it's maybe me, I just can't handle constant people that much.  I needed a break today to do work, etc.

I realized the collegiate partying thing is old.  I am over it.  I end up being the responsible one.  Why?  Because the calories in alcohol is not made up for by being drunk.  Enough said.

Good stuff though:  met sailors.  Like real ones, not navy men.  Drank really good Chinese beer.  Hate American beer.  Surprisingly liked this kind.  Had a beautiful answering message.  The sunset, his thoughts of me.  Always tasty.  Different feelings there.  Sweet email today.  Good to know I'm still thought about.  Oh, R.  

I have been immersing myself in books.  So good to just have the time to read and breathe.  It's been really rough the last few nights.  I wish I could just wake up as someone else right now.  Someone already there.  Not hanging in the balance.  Really confusing night a few days ago.  It was ugly.  Insomnia is back hardcore.  Spending time with people also just makes me look at them and say ""why not me?"" Why can't I be perfect and happy too?  And I'm feeling apprehensive about living with someone because of this annoying attachment to home.  I am ready to cut ties, and I'm feeling like they won't. Eww.  

But I was well rewarded by watching motivational material (ie.  Evita and Ghost World).   That always perks me up.  Today is blah and grey, but leading me to something good tomorrow.  At least I think...."

Opening on a seminar class...inside the entertainment industry.  I am starting to be a lil' scared.  No joke.  Which is why Sarah's refridgerator is empty and will remain that way until she loses ten to fifteen pounds.  Poop on weight and body image.  BUT it's going to be the class to get me through the experience.

THEN  cute message from Anne, glad to know she's back.  Hello, relief!

THEN AMAZING studio tv prod class!  Hello, my teacher is the cutest man.  He's like a puffy teddy bear and so fun.  A little uncomfortable that he directed the lecture kinda at me, but you know, whatever works!!  He's really funny in a dumb way.  Love it!  Plus we made fun of IN and just in general talked shop.  No one does that much w/ me.  I totally looked like the girl next door today in lots of pink.  I'll scare them w/ the black later.  I DO have 6 weeks to break out the punk rocker in me.  

AND I ran into my ""LA BUDDY"" which is what I call this muppet looking kid.  But he cut all of his hair and he's just so Will.  He's exactly the kind of guy I need in my life.  And I think he likes me.  Probably not in that way, don't even know if he's gay, but it's Emerson and my radar is all-kinda of fucked up.  (Case in point:  Rob).  Anyway, he's adorable and I think we'll hang out.  I am interested.  He's just so High Fidelity.  Aw **.

And I think I have repaired friendships between 3 ex-bf/men/whatever today.  Nice, fun emails to and from all of them.  Getting back to a friendship so maybe not as much weirdness.

Right now:
Goal #1=lose 10-15 lbs by August

Goal #3=finish my ""novel""
Goal#4=film something
Goal#5=read all of my Warhol books because I won't see them while I'm in LA.

Almost got mugged like 30 feet from my apt.  Good thing the guy had a sense of humor.  I am in such a Sarah-giddy mood.  Probably nervousness, anxiety, whatever.  But after watching Avril Lavigne jump around without the sound on for an hour at the gym this morning, I don't know.  I do get the attraction, A.  But punk rocker?  Not even close.  Repeat after me:  Avril Lavigne-the MALL TOUR.  Dumb.

But he asked for a quarter, and I was listening to ""English Civil War"" and just having fun, so I just laughed and was like wish I did 'cause I have monsters of laundry to do.  He looked at the City Video small plastic bag questioningly, what's that?  I took out a quite-abused copy of Chattahoochee (with my future bf Gary Oldman) and he was like, nah.  He was like, what else you got?  I was like, where would I put it?  He looked at me, and laughed so sketchy guy stayed where he was and I walked on the other side of the street coming home.  Disaster averted.  If he only knew what I could put in those boots.  

Then, walking on Newbury, I completely had this woman freaked out.  Fucking tourists.  Like, she was totally getting more nervous.  I was just chillin' to ""Untouchables"", and she kept trying to look back at me.  I almost was like I am NOT going to mug you in my GAP leather jacket, Chanel lipstick, and Doc Martens.  So dumb.  Like, hello!  Am I threatening?  Don't think so.  But it made me smile.  And giggle out loud a bit.

So, Mom's on the phone and I am up and out.  Riiiiiiinse out, nuccas!"

  And yet, all these ex-bf's from years (like high school days) still take the time to email me some very deep things.  I wonder how different things would be between us now?  Maybe I would be Mrs. Minister.

   My greatest fear is being forgotten.  In the greater scheme of things, not leaving my creative mark:  to quote Tantalus again ""To die before I've done what I was born for"".  But also with people.  I guess like, I fear being so uninteresting that no one ever considers me.  In a way, the phone call tonight disagreed, but I am confounded why after a year and a half of desperately needing that attention, it appears now.  (Almost?) too late?  But then again, the attention I thought was right under my fingertips perhaps was just a place-holder all along...

"event","Just wonderings of thought today.  

Walking along Comm Ave, listening to my iPod (which seems to get much more mileage than my cell these days) the song ""Overcome"" by Live came on.  First of all, that song is so linked to 9/11 for me, and the words and music, etc are so moving.  But as I was listening, feeling not so good physically, I noticed these little pansies with their faces turned to me as I passed.  And I wondered, does nature know what goes on?  Why does it always just repair itself?  Why doesn't it need blood for blood and see the tears, etc?  And then I thought about how simple those flowers were and how at peace they were just existing. 
   It made me remember packing with my parents this week, about how easy it was to surrender material stuff like clothes, but books were painful.  And how these thoughts, words, etc have existed for hundreds of years and still are so powerful.  But ten years from now, will it matter if I've even existed?  Or had the extra ten pounds I kill myself over?  And why do I run from people?  Why is every relationship surface and always better in my mind, but disappointing in reality the second they open their mouths.  Or turn their cheek.  I guess it's the detachment from real life sometimes, like in films.  A voyeuristic experience, film/movies makes promises the body can't deliver by planting something in a mind.  And yet, as I passed those flowers, I realized honestly I would rather die than not be an actress.
    On the other hand, sometimes I dream about what it would be like to live complacently w/ 2.3 children, no great love affair, no worries about appearances or talent.  Just make sandwiches and wait.  I think it would feel much the way slitting your wrists with a needle feels like, deadly slow and somehow numbing.

"event","Why is it that the first bite (or taste so to speak) of anything is always so much better than the rest?  I think I never want to have anything else but always having the first time, everytime.  Hmm, Adult ADD perhaps?  They give you amphetamines for that...!

Which brings me to weirdness #1:  serious discussion w/ my mom opening with ""Do you know anyone who can get me some speed?"".  Hmm, apparently some things might run in the family.  Together we concurred if it was good enough for Jackie O, then we should all get it.  So what if it burns me out...I'd be skinny and extremely happy + awake for at least a good twenty years.  

Moving onto weirdness #2:  mating season/ex-bf hormones.  Why do I keep receiving random, ""thank you for changing my life/I'm worried about you/I was thinking about you, etc""  bullshit emails  (and one potentially drunk dial that Tom-Tom witnessed)?  Like, after four years, I don't think about you ex-bf.  And since WHEN did I EVER motivate someone to enter the ministry  (not Catholic)?  

Onward to weirdness #3:  I'm the other woman.  Always thought it was a joke.  Nope, stole my first real bf from his girlfriend who was my friend (even if he wears women's clothes these days...), and proceeded to steal (or ""borrow"") men from at least 10 other girls/women.  I am the mistress.  And why?  Because it's fun.  Has all the danger and thrill of a relationship with thhe added bonus of alotting me my personal space, free time, and NO COMMITMENT!!!  ""They may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom...!""  (shout out to J.Juday on that one!).  I think this is my life.  

Final weirdness #4:  All I've wanted to do is buy some new kicks, but I keep getting sidetracked by responsibilities.  Partly distracted as well by reading.  For me, I am lacking the companionship of smart people who read Nietzsche and remember the sixties.  Is it so wrong that I get choked up on memories everytime I hear Nirvana?  Oh, junior high- ugly, smart, so boring, but having fun not even realizing it.  Amazing.  Or why I cannot sleep because of terrible dreams, really violent stuff....And why do I seem to always have extreme amounts of Margot Tannenbaum eyeliner on in them?  Hmm, I wonder.  

And WHY is a high school friend in an anti-drug commercial where this girl w/ Debra Messing hair writes a note w/ ""Dear Richard""...hi!  Way to use his real name...and he's GAY.  No girls for him!  And why does my mom feel the need to point out that he's working and never went to college?  Like, hello!  You made me go!  I wanted to Jack-Kerouac-my-way to LA and sell my soul...but no!  I had to have a fucking degree.  A useless fucking degree.  No one in the real world cares if you have a degree in acting.  Even if it's from NYU or whatever, you still end up on shit like Will and Grace.  Hi, end the show.  It's over, it's lame....Ooh, Sarah bitterness!

Well, off to straighten my hair...addicted to my brand-spanking new iron, off to NEwbury and shoe shopping, cafe for a glass of wine, and people.  Give me glamour.


Favorite thing right now:
When actress Frances Farmer was filling out her arrest form for drunk driving, under occupation she wrote:  ""cocksucker"".  She was committed shortly after tht incident.  But perhaps in Hollywood that was her true job...?"

Strange phone call, possibly a drunk dial, the other night.  Sorta shook me up.  Emails are one thing, hearing a voice is so much a different tbing.  I don't want to really ever hear it again.

I have a feeling I'm going to be losing something else soon.  And I know it will be OK, in a way it never was before, but that's life.  And since it wasn't actually ""real"" to begin with, how can it seem ""real"" now?  But at least it was beautiful.

It's very strange to be the one left behind this summer.  I've never been that role before.  It's not a bad feeling, just an awareness.  Being with Tom forced me to realize how different I am, maybe mixed bad and good.  I realized talking to him last night, I am not at all that girl from Ball State.  I'm not sure I like losing her.  But maybe it was a process of gaining a soul."

"event","So by watching copious amounts of films to distract me from me these last few days, I guess I've been thinking.  Being very Sarahlike and screening all of my calls and shutting myself off from the world, afforded me some serious thoughts.


There is no greater joy for me right now than to just screw all the inbred conceptions of what I should be and just run outside with whatever amount of black eyeliner I want on and let the wind mess up my hair.  Or sit by my window in a Tshirt and write in the dark.  Or fall in love, even thought logic just tells me no.

Two quotes have been going through my head.  One from recently, and about a year ago I guess, that someone wrote about a character/me/whatever.  ""you have the surface of a heart"".  When I reread that, yeah, I did, especially for everyone who knew me at BSU.  I wasn't really living and didn't give a damn about much else.  I saw through the good intentions of those around me, especially the authority.  Part of leaving school is just leaving that system behind.  I don't believe in man-made boundaries based on age, etc, so respecting/workshiping faculty for being just faculty is false.  My parents didn't treat me as a secondary human, so why should I recognize rules about conduct anyone else made?

The second, ""I will envy any man you ever love"", came from someone not very essential, but stuck with me for five years.  I've questioned who I am and my own power as a result of Tantalus, but also personally.  I thought back on friendships, relationships, etc and I saw an ugly trend.  We all have our own vices, or flaws.  What works for me, I would never want to pass on to someone else.  I saw it occurring in my friendships.  Am I responsible for their destructions?  Maybe, at least partly.  And why?  Competition?  A glorification of something that they missed the message of?  I'm still searching.  How could my will be strong enough to do that?  It's a frightening influence.

Step By Step (the old, Suzanne Somers sitcom) made me pause.  A girl said that she was jealous of being younger because she misses her boyfriends taking her to the movies instead of back to his hotel room.  I thought, wow, it's so true.  Where along the lines did relationships have to become vapid?  Where did that sensitivity go and why replace it?  But what if you could keep a relationship stagnated in an emotional connection?  I've been called untouchable or cold more times than I liked to remember in ways which were both charming (Jake) and disappointing (Charlie).  Maybe it's a sense of independence.  This year has proved I can survive alone, even if it walks a fine line sometimes.  

But what if something came along just to warm me up?  Literally, in alien sort of way?  In a way that I can't depend on because it's not mine, but in a way there is  a secret magic that is?  And what if it was everything you ever dreamed about in that soft  butterfly wing way - always too delicate to be real?  But warped in the mirror so it might only be a self-imposed reflection?  And is that how I see myself too?  


What is reality for me?"

I think I'm developing narcolepsy...like the stage manager major in my class.  (The irony there...I'm confused.).  ANyway.  Such an Indiana night last night.  Party in the basement, an unfinished basement mind you, with kegs, shots off of ice blocks, and skanky girls.  I was like, wait, where am I?  So freshmen year.  The amazing thing is that Anne had all of the same experiences when she went to IU...maybe it IS a state-wide thing....I didn't think places like this were existing in the suburbs...like Blair Witch:  The Kegger.  Eww, I was like the total freak, like not drunk b/c my voice is so bad and I don't want to hurt it more, not high b/c it's disgusting and all the smoke was killing my voice.  And stuck in a corner w/ a Berklee boy who was an asshole.  And apparently I have class with his roomate three times a week.  Hmm.  Berklee boy was so rude and I shot him down and he would not let up. Then he grabbed me and that was it...don't ever lay a hand on me.  I was out.  I grabbed Anne, and we split.

So apparently Chinatown is the smartest part of Boston:  clubs/bars, etc close at 2am.  So their restaurants are open until 4am or at least the place we found.  Way good, way cute, semi-formal.  YUmmy.  Two weirdnesses:  two guys who totally yelled across the room at us what to order, etc...um, ewww!  And were like eat some beef girls...like, what is that?  Then, they had these freak creatures that looked like 20,000 leagues under the sea types.  Totally scary and Anne was way distracted by it!  But amazing fun.  Then a lil' Sex in the City.....finally bed at 5:30 am...

The rest of the weekend is brilliance.  Tonight, more ANne Sex in the City with a lil' wine, cheese, etc....then editing (poop) tomorrow, thai w/ Anne followed by Kill Bill (yea!), and writing papers all Monday.

So the reference to Jim Morrison at the beginning.  And this was where my mind was hardcore yesterday so maybe that's why I hated the party.  I had a totally almost spiritual moment the other (TR) night and I'm just confused, but like blown away.  There was some footage I saw of Jim Morrison and Nico (who didn't really speak English well at the time) when they met.  He was walking on the edge of castle ledge for her, they both were out of their minds on drugs, but it turned into this dancelike love making kinda thing.  Not graphic, but all through really innocent touch.  Yeah, it was like that.  

Anyway, get my asss to the gym time...and then buy lots of girl-time stuff for tonight!"

It was so much how I've been feeling for like a year and a half and all the emotional craziness inside of me.  So much naivete has been blown away for me.  I don't think I can ever have old friendships or go back to anywhere I've been before or remain where I am now much longer.  I know in life, it's been very safe, and I'm afraid I've traded that safety intentionally for a much riskier route that still somehow is rooted in a detachment.  But there is some merit I suppose to the alienated, disillusioned artist.  Life doesn't always work out the way it's supposed to be planned.  I guess I embrace my expatriotism from the human race too much at times, though.  I was overwhelmed last night by my capacity to feel Tom.  I'm not hugely into people sometimes, but I can't express in words how deep our relationship is always.  So we may not choose the life most people do, there is something beautiful in the quiet real nature of individuals.  My idol lived some very different lives, and in her ambiguity, I can see myself.  That almost asexual persona she hid because society made her into a molded, tool to propagate outdated concepts of gender, fame, and success.  It essentially destroyed her.  Her words always ring around in my mind and I see such simple honesty and strength.  Last night I heard similar tones in my BFF.  I guess walking the emotional edge can bring liberation and maybe a sense of peace we will eventually arrive at embracing."

I feel like there is a tiny little thread that is unraveling in my emotional fabric.  Everything is so shook up.  It's just this pervading sense of bullshit.  Everything is skimming the surface.  People aren't really friends with each other, people don't take 5 mins for each other, and mostly people are so damn mediocre and complacent.  I guess I expected more from the world at 21.  I am so exhausted with changing things.  I don't want to sit back and live a quiet peaceful life.  I want excitment and something tangible.  
   Like in class, classmates actually telling the teacher that an issue causes too much debate so let's drop it.  THAT'S THE POINT.  It is inconcievable to me that someone would actually consider that we shouldn't talk about an issue.  But it's like Niemoller's Holocaust poem, if it doesn't affect/interest you then....But that class would be down my throat if I said I didn't give a damn about gay rights because it doesn't affect me.  You can't be for one civil rights issue and not another one  --  not when you're screaming for equality.  Otherwise, it's selective equality and that's impossible.
    And as for projects, I am beyond irritation.  I think at this point they're trying to aggravate me.  Like nothing I am, know, or say is as brilliant as them.  Fuck that.  I'm sorry my great aspiration is not to glorify my shitty little conservative New England town, make a Lifetime movie, or feel that the WB is the epitome of acting.  There is a reason why those actors don't do features.  See the definition for one-trick pony.  And ps, Me, Myself, and Irene is NOT the height of artistry in the industry.  Do not try to tell me that one.  
     I know I have some crazy tastes and I would never subject someone to sit through my films unless they wanted to, but for real, I know what I am talking about.  And I hate the concept that people, aka you, see the business as just about money.  Great art and successful films are about more than that...they want to say something.  And just copying someone else's work or adapting another's story sucks.  Why just keep recycling shit?  That's why I hate the stage now.  Name something new that's not some lame-ass revival or a show exclusively crafted for laughs within the theatre community.  Where's the social progress?  The larger picture?  
    I have sat back recently and watched my generation both here, Lebo, and BSU.  And I am so disgusted.  Nothing's changed.  I loved the idealism and openess of Lebo.  But here, and even more so at BSU, kids are just blind.  It's like all that matters is drinking, and their little glass houses.  No one is talking anymore.  Like after 9/11, no real art, music, theatre came out of it.  I cannot believe that no artists went public with a statement.  Vietnam, all world wars, poverty, suffrage, civil rights all inspired some works of art.  What did my generation do?  Nothing.  Pop music and rap demeaning women and objectifying the government as crap.  That's it, no inspiration, no thoughts of change.  I'm frustrated because I see society regressing.  It disgusts me that artists like Eminem are in the  foreground.  What does he offer but hate?  Name some good thing out of his music.  People say he's paridying social commentary...I would disagree.  When I ask his fans why he's brilliant, I always get the same answer:  he's changed music.  Ok, how?  Uh....That's right, he hasn't.  Punk rock at least had a cause, especially in England when the people lived in shit.  And they forced the government to notice, even if it wasn't brilliant musically.  
    And to intentionally after hanging out long enough for me to tell about women's issues that we shouldn't be in the military because your friend has to pick up the slack?  That is SO not right.  And if you feel that way, enlist your ass and risk it for the country.  If I hear one more time about being a model is the only way to be an actress, I'm going to scream.  Yes, it would be fantastic for me to be a model.  And if I could, I would in a heartbeat.  But if I was  a 90lb. 5'9"" leggy blonde, I too would be in Milan and married to a rock star.  But life isn't always perfect.  Which brings me to the issue of religion.  No, I didn't know Sunday was Easter.  So, stop bringing it up.  I guess I wish I could accept religion again.  But after breaking nearly all the commandments, at this point I don't know if it's possible.  Do I believe in God?  Absolutely.  Do I feel an organized religion is the answer?  Probably not.  The Bible simply gives moral stories, which are completely symbolic and applicable to life.  But organized religions make them infailible and take them literally.  There is no reason, genders can't be equal in religion.  I think the scandals of C. Church illustrate that one.  In a way, too, religion frightens me in the same way political parties and interest groups do.  They try to convert and contain people and opinions into a few categories instead of encouraging free thought and new ideals.  How many of my friends are really part of a political party/ideal just because their parents are or someone else tells them to be?  How many people look at the candidates aside from the cult of the group?  And in regard to the Passion and anyone who feels it's Anti-Semitic?... Here's how I feel:  movies are made about Hitler constantly and people don't blame the Germans anymore publicly because it's not pc.  And it happened with a generation that basically is extinct.  Yes we should remember it, but not every German was responsible.  It's time to move one.  The Bible is even older.  So, Gibson told a story.  And yes in that story people and religions were involved.  But I can't imagine that too many Christians still honestly blame the Jews for Jesus' death.  The scriptures foretold it, a, and b, God basically commanded it.  He had to die.  That was a divine decision.  So move on.  
       OK...time to calm down and be ready for a long day.  Billy is helping as usual.  Yea, comfort music.  Maybe not high-brow, but his voice is so soothing.  I woke up this morning with the thought:  wouldn't it be great to be a chubby, boring little complacent secretary and want nothing more out of life than babies and a house on the Cape.  But I don't want to settle, and if I destroy myself in the process, I'd rather die trying than waste a life doing nothing."

"event","First of all, how much do I love this song?  Been reflecting on my crazy weekend.  On the treadmill today, I had this great thought.  My past is so completely dead.  Physically (see David, Pre-Pro, etc) and symbolically.  I feel no real connection or need to relive everything and remember the ""glory days"".  The only regret I have so strongly is that Christine and I aren't friends.  I realized today, and I guess throughout the week, that the reason I had for just fading out of it was selfish and mostly fear.  I saw in her so much of myself, it's not that we ran out of things to say, but that I didn't want to deal with how easily her problems would become my own.  Recently, I have missed her more than anyone in my life.  She was the one person I could open up to about so many personal things.  I thought she didn't know me at all, but looking back, she knew me better than anyone.  I'm disgusted that in my life I skim through relationships with people.  I guess most people do, and it's so sad.  We never delve too deep.  If we all could take a moment and really know each other maybe the world would implode.  I don't know. And I don't know if she even reads this, because I think she's actually blocked me from AIM.  But, I guess I find myself needing that friendship.  Yeah, there are some fantastic people in my life, but not that spent five years with me and essentially ffinally got to the really deep parts.  There are lots of people in my life, but you know, I never want to call them as much as I wish I could go back two years and call her.  Even during the bad times, Chris actually took the time to ask me why, or if I was OK, or what was going on.  Or just call and make me laugh.  She was five years of my life and I loved her so much (not in a romantc way for all the immature people out there).  I guess maybe I was always a step behind her and didn't want to face up to it.  But man, do I miss her.  And it was my mistake."

"event","""Most of the time I'm halfway content.  Most of the time, I know exactly where it all went.  I don't cheat on myself.  And I don't run and hide.  Hide from the feelings that I buried inside.  And I don't compromise"".

So, yeah we talk...A LOT.  Not only was I totally wired last night, I didn't go to bed until 4:30am.  Which is why I am sitting here now w/ very wet, VERY wavy hair in my apt and NOT in Hist of Jazz.  To be quite frank, there are certain causes I could give a rat's ass about and that class covers one of them.  Poop.  That and my teacher stares at the floor when he talks and literally is 12 yrs old.  
   Last night, I went to bed with a really comforting sense that I am a) going to have very bizarre relationships with people (men) for the rest of my life  b)  going to die of some freak chemical effect based on stuff I eat at a very early age  c) move on with my life starting now.  
   Let's start w/ the chemicals.  I realized probably nothing I've eaten has been like natural, real food.  It's all definitely processed.  It freaks me out.  Where is the reality in it.  I can't even control the food I eat to be real.  It's like what is exactly in it!!  
   The men in my life are so incredibly strange. Sometimes I think it's me.  But then at the same time, Fate is fucking w/ my mind.  I have been so good all year, taking a break, living vicariously through movies, and now there are like five men in my life and it's overwhelming.  First, I actually tried dating.  A YOUNGER guy.  Reasons why I hate it:  I am so FUCKING bored.  It's like, hello...please have an opinion about something and  do not placate me by pretending you understand the words I use.  Dumb.  Maybe he doesn't still sit around in a dorm playing video games, but just no.  Second guy is probably old enough to be my father  (notice the pattern) and keeps asking me out for coffee.  Weird instinct kicked in and I just feel uncomfotable about it.  Don't know why.  But being on a date w/ MR. 19.5 makes me want to accept.  Nice guy, but no Jack Wagner.  Third guy, randomly met him when he was working at a bar.  Finance major.  Never going to work.  Analytical men usually end up trying to commit suicide over me or are ""still processing"" what it means that I messed w/ his friend.  Fourth guy, very nice, interesting prof  (this time NOT my prof) who very out-of-the-blue is extremely nice to me.  He does some cool film work, experimental...OK, well Tom knows the emails.  One does not send emails to someone who's not a BFF to tell you they don't remember the question they wanted to ask you FIVE HOURS BEFORE.  But at the same time, I'm actually interested in this one.  (Down girl...).  Fifth guy, let's just say I've wasted three years (I figured that out last night around 3:47am) on him.  It's time to let go.  And now that we're talking, I suddenly realized last night that maybe my affection is actually pity and a need for a father figure.  I never really felt that way before.  But maybe attraction to him is just an outlet to find someone else to worry about me.  He actually was the only boyfriend I ever had who a)  still talks to me  b)  made sure (and still does) that I am eating, sleeping, studying, and happy.  There's a lot of comfort in that for me.  I guess I want to hold onto him a little more.  At least until I find someone else to grab onto.  And I hate that because I desperately want to be independent and a woman who doesn't need anyone else.  But here's the thing:  all those years I rushed into life, I think I missed the dependent stage and  now I could use a few more years at being a kid.  Like I never really was one.  I think I went from 11 to 20 overnight.  But having him so close (well, actually like 4hrs away) is strange.  He's right there and I can't see him.  And now the prospect of him being across the globe is very unsettling, but also really liberating because maybe then life will force me to just give up and actually let go.  Holding onto him does cause me to question why and if it meant that maybe he was ""the one"".  
   The LA meeting was amazing.  I am SO EXCITED!!!  I feel like Jessie Spano on caffeine pills.  It's very strange to think about real life.  All of my friends here have at least another year and I'm almost gone.  Having people look at my apt is like a big reality check.  I'm kinda scared because I know I love living on the edge and LA will put me so close to it.  There are times now, here, that I am already there and it might only get worse.  When I read books from the Factory people (Superstars), I see so much of myself in them.  And it's very tempting and dangerous to live that life.  But I honestly would rather live to see nothing past 40 if I've had a good time and never been bored.  But it's hard to make people understand that.  I guess it's safe that most people in my life are practical, but so frustrating when I want to talk about these feelings.  Everyone is so quick to say no to me.   And like I'm really kinda awkward about telling people these things becuase I know it's crazy.  And I am tired of being seen as the crazy girl.  I spent two years of my life like that.  And it's exhausting."

"event","Amazing night.  Now I'm ranting and totally awake and wet.  So fun.  Liz's b-day, tofu pad thai, a lil' clubbing, a lil' meeting for class, a lil' more clubbing, and some quality girl talk PLUS!!!  me and Erik Estrada!  Who doesn't love Erik Estrada and WHY is CHiPs only on at 4 am???!!  I think he was my first celebrity crush.  So hot, so nostalgic.  I've realized while flipping through the channels that all of the films of color are played now...those and either movies based on plays or home improvement shows....Like who's really going to be building shelving at this hour?
  So, here's the deal:  some very nice hotties in the club tonight, good music, free drinks pour moi, but WHAT kinds of guys hit on me?  That's right, anyone OVER 40!  I totally didn't even try.  And like, for real, I have not been SPANKED in a club since I was 15.  Did not so much need to relive that image.  Here's a lil' tip to all those of us who feel so average and boring...go to a Brazilian club.  Blondes are DEFINITELY a hot commodity.  So nice to hang out with the ladies.  Strange, but somehow so caring, my friend totally got married to this gay, Argentinian man so he can keep his visa.  Props for her.  
  Major faux pas:  My mom thinks I drunk dialed her now...I didn't.  I called b/c I know she worries, but there was tons of background noise PLUS 2 guys fighting...oops!  (AND it was 12:45am). 
   So here's one more quick rant.  How do I be a feminist (think militant) and maintain a sexual relationship with men?  I like men A LOT. And yet, society's role for women is maintained and propagated by the negative and competitive masculine power.  Like, culturally it is accepted to refer to women as bitches (hello, derrogatory!) and never call me bastards.  Stupid slang words for female anatomical parts are accepted as meaning weak.  Or like today, my teacher (female...actually thought she WAS a lesbian for quite a long time) made a joke about throwing a ball like a girl.  It pissed me off.  I am so tired and angry at the way women are demeaned.  Here's my deal:  Wonderwoman gets a small boustier, but Batman clearly is not in a Speedo.  And name two sex scandals involving women where the women weren't branded sluts while the men were just being ""boys"".  Looking at Greek plays is so clear to me.  Women who fail to be faithful and weak against their husbands are eventually killed violently, etc.  I'd rather get it over with at times than drown in the slow suffocation of society's repression.  
    Reality TV is a perfect example.  Starting w/ shows like Survivor and the Apprentice.  Women are rewarded for physcial hotness and sex.  Poop on that.  And then fucking Jessica Simpson.  I think she's worthless.  Can't dance, can't sing, can't even barely form a sentence.  MTV doesn't even have to edit to make her look stupid.  Britney-""I'm a Slave 4U""-Spears.  Sexuality is fine and it sells, but at least Xtina's lyrics are girl-power.  Avoiding the trite, boys are gods kinda shit.  And Charlize Theron can also kiss my ass b/c she is doing little more than propagating the constant image of women in Hollywood showing frontal nudity frequently.  Name a best actress Oscar winner in years who hasn't done that..PS Julie Andrews even did.  And plastic surgery.  You don't see Pacino running off to Botox.  But women are rewarded for stupid things, not acting.  Johnny Depp doesn't win awards just for changing his hair.  But chicks who wear fake noses, latex skin, and gain weight instead of really ACTING roles seem to reign.  
   So where did we go wrong?  Humans were such a beautiful matriarchal, n ature based society until what?  All religions shifted into misogynistic crap.  
   OK...time to crawl into bed with Erik Estrada and attempt sleep b/c I'm freezing.  Snow in March.  Blow me.  

Super fun night.  Worth it all."

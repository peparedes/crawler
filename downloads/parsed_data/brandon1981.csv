"event","Last night I went and met a guy who is looking to start a band. He lives in this totally kick ass studio above a bar. The place is a shit hole, but it has that 'awesome downtown studio' potential, so therefore kicks ass. It is along this strip on the hill, 11th ave E, and there are about 3 bars on this block, artists studios upstairs, and down in the basements are these practice spaces that bands can rent. I was getting a killer vibe from the whole area in general. It just felt right to be there. He played me some of his stuff, then I did the same for him, and it worked out pretty well. Hopefully we will get together again real soon adn start some shit up. I am pretty sure we will be making music together, since we both liked each others stuff alot. It felt great to get out and do that. AND FINALLY today is FUCKING HOT!!!!! I am roasting, and my armpits already smell less than fresh, even though I just showered and applied. (too much information maybe but what the hell) and I am off!!!!!"

"event","Friday night, Phil (my roomate) and I went to a Birthday party for a friend over in Eastlake. We had a couple shots before getting the taxi cab to his house, and then proceeded along with everyone else to do our best at getting trashed. There were alot of cool people there, including some cute boys ;) (one of whom I am having dinner with on Wed.) ANYWAYS after the party, Phil and I got a taxi back up to the hill, about 3am. We were in search of food by then, but everyone was closing up. As usual, the line up at the Jack in the Box drive through was huge, but Phil wanted to walk through it. I told him that would be a bad idea... so he stopped a cab to take us through. We got in and told him where we wanted to go, and he was like ""Oh, I don't have the time, I have to go to West Seattle in 20 min."" I was like WTF!! I would think if you stop a cab, they are supposed to say... ""OK let's go!"" and take you where you want to go! Isn't that the whole point of getting a cab!!! *rolls eyes* So we just had him take us to QFC to get food. THen we went home, and continued partying until 6am! We were havin a great time, until Phil got sick..LOL yes, his 130 lbs. of carbon and water couldn't take any more alcohol. So I was taking care of him until 11:30 that night, getting water, etc. I was doin ok, just tired. So that night I just watched movies and fell asleep. Today was cool, Phil and I just hung around and went all over the area, walking around and takin in the rays (it is like 75-80 degrees here today) Totally kick ass weather. Now I am about to go home and relax, and read the French and Brittish newspapers I picked up. BTW... Did you know that Wed. was the Queen's Jubilee? Yes indeedy! It is the 50th year of her reign. Phil, who is from the UK was totally miffed because since he has been here this year, he has missed two totally important national events: THe Queen mothers death, and now the jubilee. All over the UK there was a two day holiday, for all workers, and apparently it was one big drunken party..LOL Poor Phil :(  So cheers to Phil, and you made up for that this weekend!! One more thing, the 'Fucking Fabulous Film Festival' is takin place the weekend of the 22nd of June. At Coffee Messiah, over on Olive St. :)"

"event","We have been having switch weather today, not unusual for Seattle... Lots of my friends are complaining, but I kinda like it. I went out to dinner with my roomate about an hour ago, and on our way home, we passed this kinda cute guy who said something to me... I thought he said ""Ugly hair dude""  LOL And I was kinda shocked, but just kept walking. So I said to Phil (my roomate) ""did he just say 'ugly hair' to me?"" And Phil thought he said something about how he liked it, so that was wierd. I just think it's funny when people walk down the street and drop negative comments to random people. SO lame. Then we spotted about 12 people all in purple, like, bodypaint, clothes and all. Phil (who is from Northern Ireland) was asking me if they were sports fans or something. I was trying to tell him that the only sports team around here that uses purple is the Huskies, and that they would probably be wearing gold as well. He just didn't get it..LOL He asked if it was for the sonics or something. Turns out it was just an art project. Now I am going home to write some music. see ya!"

"event","Well, I called my mom today. Sad to say, my doggie, Rocky, died in his sleep, at 12 years of age, in my parent's bedroom on Tuesday night. They live in Woodinville, as I said before. So he was buried in our backyard, under a tree, where we used to run and play. We got Rocky, a Miniature Collie (sheltie) when I was in 5th grade. My mom was late picking my sister and I up from school, so we were in the schoolyard in after school care. We had been talking about getting a dog for a while, so my sister and I were hopefull that she had gone to get one. Sure enough, when she pulled up, there he was! A little black white and brown puppie :) !! On the way home, we stopped at Godfathers to pick up pizza for dinner, and gave our new puppie some water. WHen we got home, he was running around the living room barking, and we couldn't figure out why. I was freakin out on the couch (sad to say) and hten he suddenly stopped, and peed all over the carpet! Of course, after that we knew what it meant when he did that again. His full name was 'Rocky Lamborghini MB SKiles' Cause I liked Lamborghinis at the time, and Rocky and Bullwinkle...lol. He was a strange dog, so we fit together pretty good. He loved to chase and attack me, and he loved to 'attack the dishwasher' (he hated that infernal machine, but all in good fun)Rocky pretty much grew up with me, and when I moved out a few months ago, it was hard to be away from him. I always thought I could go see him anytime, even though we knew he was kinda sick. Apparently he had cancer in his liver. Thankfully, he wasn't really in pain the days before he died, and was playful. He died quietly in his sleep Tuesday night, as the world's greatest dog, in my opinion at least. He is the closest 'family member' to have died in my lifetime. And I loved him. So, that is my tribute to Rocky... farewell, and godspeed, I only wish I could hold you once more, my faithful friend."

"event","When I posted my last entry, I wasn't able to get to the confirmation page, so I apparently posted it three times. Well, I took care of that! And, as for the content of that post, the musicians and I had a jam session that evening, and it was incredible! i think it is safe to say, at this point in time at least, that we are going to pursue a future together as band mates. :) I am so excited! The guy has an incredible singing voice, and he is quite good on keyboards, and the girl he came here with is a great harmonizing vocalist. Our styles seem to complement each other well too. In other news, I am going down to a friends art show tonight... He is the artist I have hanging in my flat, so the paintings I had up there are now in the show, but I get 'em back afterwards ;) If you live in the Seattle area, the show is at Aristocrats, a nightclub downtown. Their website is: www.aristocratsclub.com  If you are around, come down and check it out, you won't be dissapointed, he does awesome work - there will be a DJ there too, for what that is worth. Now I am getting back to work, which I am sick of. :P"

"event","Yesterday afternoon, as I was typing in my LJ I met a guy and a girl who just moved up here to Seattle to start a band! What luck! They seem to have the same ideas regarding music as I do, so I am hopeful... we are going to jam tonight and see what's up. One glitch... We were meeting here at my friends coffee shop, at 7:30 tonight.. they are late but now here! Gotta run! I guess they aren't too flakey after all :)"

"event","So today has yet to be eventfull, as I have not done anything to further human growth yet. I didn't really get any sleep last night, so I was up at 7am (this is a record for me I think). I was feeling pretty hollow inside, and kinda lonely. I went to a local grocer and got some milk, came home and had some Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and read from Heman's Poetical Works. The book was printed in 1854, and it was fun to open it up and wonder how long it had been since those particular pages I was reading had seen the light of day. I wondered who was the last to take these words in... perhaps a well to do Victorian lady had been the last, reading by candlelight the words of someone long since passed on. Or perhaps a young boy who went upstairs to his grandmother's trunk to discover 'lost treasures' had opened it up and begun to read from it's leaves. :) In any case, it was fun to think about. Then I went back to bed... and a few hours later, when I woke up I was overjoyed to find that there was a SpongeBobSquarePants marathon on Nickelodeon!!! Needless to say, I watched with fervor and pleasure as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidword went about their adventures. If you don't have a clue what I am talking about, then you obviously are lacking in pop culture wisdom ;)  Anyways, Now that it is 6:30 I am up and at 'em - and fully recovered from my crazy weekend of non-stop parties. Oh yeah, I got a mohawk again today too (I had one a few months ago and shaved it off after a few weeks). Maybe I will go out to eat and then later compose some music... yeah, that sounds fun :)"

"event","Hi there, I just got my livejournal started, so this is my first entry (ok like I needed to point that out) ANYWAYS ... It is a beautiful sunny day here in Seattle, and I have been partying all weekend. Apparently all my friends planned their parties for THIS weekend.. so I am pooped. And now I sit and relax... listening to Frank Sinatra singing 'three coins in the fountain' (Sinatra totally kicks ass y'all) typing this up in a coffe shop that is about two blocks from my flat. I live over on 1st Hill in Seattle. I moved here about 2 months ago, away form the parents..YAY !~ I will be updating frequently, so you can read all about my exciting life and friends *note of sarcasm in the air*

Ok bye for now. and thanks to DanielSpice for helping me get this started."

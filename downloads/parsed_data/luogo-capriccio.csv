"event","So...  I DEFINITELY like him (Blaine knows who I'm talking about).  Aw, and he cut his hair over the weekend...but it looks good, so it's ok.  So anyway, it's about 3:15 PM now, and I just got done writing and reading a story...and let's just say that I can definitely see us together.  And it's AMAZING.  Donc, je l'adore.  Il est le monde, le ciel, les etoiles...  Il est mon coeur et, enfin, je l'adore.  Donc...c'est tout.  I really do like him, and I'm definitely thinking our calculus class needs to have a New Year's party now.  :D  Parce que je l'adore, et j'ecrais une histoire de ca.  That's all I can seem to say right now; je l'adore.  And he probably doesn't even know that I like him.  He seemed to be looking at me yesterday and today in Physics, but my peripheral vision is kind of hazy; plus, since I moved up by him (next to Danny, who was sitting in front of him), he could have easily been like, ""What's she doing?""  But who knows.  *shrugs*  For some reason I have the urge to talk to Josue about it (Joswizzle!), but I can just see it...  ""What?""  Hushed voice.  ""You like NOLAN?""  ...  ""Are you serious?...Are you FOR REALZ?!""  Hah, after that, Nolan would either avoid me or make his move, but which one, I don't know...  Hmmm.  Maybe I'll have some gooooooooooood dreams tonight.  :)

P.S. - I'm not updating again until I'm done investigating.  'Cause #100 should be saved for something extra special.  Like, a haven't-done-it-in-four-years special.  ;)"

"event","If you were faced with two roses - one dull but thornless, one beautiful but thorned - which would you choose?

I hate being presented with decisions.  I'm so indecisive, and there's always some excuse as to why I have to choose one or the other, flip-flopping back and forth all the time.  I never know which path to follow, if my final (but entirely unsure) decision is the better or right choice.  Perhaps one day I'll have the courage and strength to pick a side, to follow through, to do what I want without fearing the consequences...  Until then, I guess I'll just have to keep sitting on my cloud, watching the world around me grow.

Maybe someone will come along and show me the way..."

"event","Yay for updates!  I've been wanting to do this for a while...I just needed the push to do it.  So thanks, Ish.  Anyhow, so today my dad and I went to check out a couple of college campuses (I was <i>so</i> tempted to write ""campi"") and eat BBQ.  Well, it was mainly for college, but we got hungry along the way.  :)  So first we went to UNT...  *gag*  I know it's an old school and all, but they could still take better care of it.  Over-all, it really wasn't impressive.  And the environment?  Ew.  Ashley, if you recall our little trip to the edge of civilization...it was bad.  Like, run-down, middle-of-nowhere bad.  So ick for Denton.  After that we drove to UTD (correction: first we went all over creation to FIND a Starbucks, where we got Green Tea Frappuccinos, which were quite yummy, might I add).  I have two words for you: Holy Wow.  For a local campus, you can't find better.  It's in Richardson (near Plano) so it's by all kinds of good stuff - nice neighborhoods, good restaurants and stores, etc.  Plus, the campus itself is AMAZING.  I love the architecture, and the whole layout is very inviting and community-oriented.  I can definitely see myself there...  So Ashley, if you want to take a college day or two, we can go up and talk to admissions counselors and tours and all that jazz.  I think it would be fun...  It's a nice campus, and instead of dorms, they have APARTMENTS!!!  They're nifty and nice-looking, and we could request to have the same apartment if you wanted to.  Living there isn't cheap ($366/month without phone service (who needs it with cell phones?) and cable), plus you have to bring your own furniture, but it would be kinda nice to get out of the house.  *shrugs*  So yeah, if anyone, ANYONE, wants to take a college day and go up there with me...let me know!  It would be fuuuuuuuuun.  *nods*

Anyway, it's 11 PM, and I should get to bed...  Hopefully I'll update my layout and finish my essay for UTD tomorrow!
'Night!

"event","So it definitely rained today...  It felt so nice to look out the kitchen window and see the water running down, gracing the street with its tiny droplets.  *le sigh*  And to be alone the whole time...  'Twas the best I've felt in a <u>long</u> time.  God, I love the rain...  Oh, and guess what else I did today?  ...I made my mum!  *squee*  It's soooooooooo pretty...  I can't wait for you guys to see it!  And it only took about 3 1/2 hours.  I know, amazing, right?  ;)  Oh crap!  That reminds me, I still need to get a dress...  But I don't know who all's going.  Hey, you know what we could do?  Leave the dance around 9:00, go out to eat, and stop by Coldstone afterwards!  Then I can go see all of my worker buddies!  Yayness.  Let's see, that would be Lou, Adam, Darren, Andrea, and maybe Chris (who, by the way, could DEFINITELY be a model).  Hmmm...  Where could I go get a dress besides Macy's and Dillards that's close?  I need to start searching, or I won't get one in time...  Oh!  And just a side note - Ms. Lyman changed the due dates for our Web Assign stuff to Tuesday at midnight!  YAY!!!!!!  But anywho, who all do you guys think is going to be there at the dance?  Like, teacher and student-wise?  Hah, Mr. Bennett was at Cotillion last year, I think he thinks that Ashley, Blaine and I are weird...  *shrugs shoulders*  I dunno, he's nice but kinda creeps me out.  Anyway, I really don't have much to update with, other than the fact that I'm excited about Wednesday...'cause it's HAT DAY!!!  And I've already got my outfit planned out, oh yes I do!  It's going to be a-MAZ-ing!  Other than that...I really don't care.  Except for Friday.  I really wanna go to the game, but...well, every time I go to a football game, we lose miserably.  Everytime I don't go, we win.  Case and point - Lakeview's homecoming.  I'm working, and we win.  Naaman - I go, and we lose.  Same for out-of-district games.  'Cause I really want us to win...but I'll feel bad and stupid if I don't go and we win, and vice versa.  So I don't know.  *sigh*  Well, just thought I'd share this quick update that only took two hours to finally finish.  :)  Adios!

"event","This thing needs a little bit of TLC every now and then.  'Cause I'm not gonna be like you-know-who and waste e-space...  I've got a website to do that for me.  XD

So, in the time since I last updated, I...well...haven't changed much.  My beliefs, goals, and personality have become more concrete.  I'm still lazy, ambitious, giddy, shy, outgoing, blonette...  Basically an ambiguous, enigmatic, incredibly redundant conundrum wrapped up in fatigue and apathy.  And while that makes no sense, neither do I.  I know who I am, what I do, but I can never predict my future actions.  I know what I want to do with my life, and yet my plans split in many different directions.  Do I want to stay in-state, or go out-of-state for college?  What exact profession do I want go after?  When and how do I tell people what needs to be said?  Do I contradict society openly, or with those closest to me?  I know what needs to be done; I'm just not sure of how to go through with it, or if I have the courage.  I often compensate for my lack of boldness by being...well...bold.  And while none of this makes sense to any of you, I can assure you it will in due time.

One night (one of the nights that changed my life in a way), as I lay in bed, I began to mull things over in my head.  Why do I do things?  What makes me feel the way I do?  What do I want from life?  <b><i>Who am I?</i></b>  It was at that last question that I came to a conclusion.  No matter how far down you delve into beliefs, my personality, you're never done.  You get so close, but can never reach it.  Just think of it like this:  You've got a variable, x.  And the problem begins:  <b>Find the limit as x approaches infinity.</b>  So you take your equation, gather all of your data, and draw a graph.  What do you find?  Do you ever reach the limit?  Of course not.  You can come infinitly close, but the line <b>never reaches its destination</b>.  It's like a never-ending quest you spend all your life on.  In the end, I had mentally compiled a list of well over 100 words to describe myself, and would have continued had I not been so tired.

And, you're probably wondering, what was on that list?  Like myself, I can sum it all up in one word:

<b>CONTRADICTION</b>.

For every definition, there was an opposite.  Outgoing, yet shy.  Intelligent, yet ditzy.  Firm believer in nothing.  Ambitious, yet lazy.  Attached, yet apathetic.  Insert any word for part A, and part B will be equally true.  Innocent, yet devilish.  Pacifist, yet violent.  Girly, yet tomboyish.

For so long, I've been so unsure of everything; now, more than ever, I'm so concrete.  It's amazing how one person, one night, can change everything you know.

I'm sure you'll never know
Who you are
But you made me new

And with these answers, a whole new set of questions appear..."

"event","Gar!  Stupid lamp.  Took me four times to get the thing to turn on this time.  Anwho, wow!  It's an update from the procrastination queen!  Actually, this is (was) originally written in a spiral, starting at 1:28 in the morning.  Hey, it's gotta start somewhere, right?  I had an unexhausting night at work, so I've got plenty of energy to FINALLY write an update.  Woot!

Ok, so first off, work.  I'm the queen of night-shifts now.  That's all I work...  And let me tell you, working a six-hour shift and having to defrost the ghea at the end of it...  THAT's pretty exhausting.  Good thing it's only done on Thursdays and Sundays.  Hah...  That reminds me, Thursday, after I had gotten done taking all of the ice cream out of the ghea, Amber wanted me to help her lift the buscart, full of ice cream, mind you, into the walk-in freezer.  Well, seeing how there were 18 pans of ice cream, I knew I couldn't do it, but thought I'd try anyway.  *snort*  Silly me.  I tried, but failed miserably.  After a few attempts, Amber finally declared that I was ""weighing down the cart even more.""  My response?  ""Oh my gosh...  I'm so weak, you have no idea.""  Of course, she sat there and laughed at me.  But hey, when doesn't she?  Eh, I love my people.  :D  Which reminds me...  My crush on Kendall?  Absolutely finito.  Oh yeah, quick question - do any of y'all know ANYONE who goes by the name of Suzy?  That name's too generic...  Eh, maybe my paranoia/naturally suspicious nature (redundant much?) is getting the best of me.  Again.  Hmmm...  We'll just have to wait and see, I guess.  But enough of my rambling.  On to more important matters...

...like losing my $300 class ring.  Shya.  My mom was absolutely LIVID when she found out...  Thank God my dad still doesn't know yet.  I'm planning on paying the $80/90 to get them to send me a new one.  I mean, it's not like I don't have the money...  *sigh*

Oh yeah, yesterday Ashley and I went SHOPPING!!!  Woot!  I love tax-free weekend...  I got a whole new outfit (minus the shoes - and oh yeah, Ashley, I'll probably be coming over later to get mine :D), a purse, and my loverly purple shoes.  *squee*  Yay!  And guess what...  NINE DAYS 'TIL MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!  I'm excited.  Kinda.  Sort of.  Not really.  *meh*  Growing up really isn't that exciting anymore...  I remember how, when I was little, I used to get butterflies in my stomach for a month before my birthday.  Now, it's kinda like, ""Yay, woo hoo, another year older. *twirl finger*""

Come to think of it, nothing's really exciting anymore.  It's like life is at a standstill.  I'm in a trance, just watching as days pass by, one after the other.  The only thing that has been really interesting lately is a Murder Mystery (role-playing game) on a forum I regularly go to.  My mind's been on it all week (it only lasts a week), but now that it's over today, everything is back to being blah.  That's why I can't wait 'til I go to college.  I'm ready to get out of here - be on my own, meet new people, live in a new city (or state), learn to really take care of myself.  Eck.  I'm too un-excited to even write about my lack of excitement.

I'll be off...  Zeke, you better not have plans on my birthday!!!!!!!!  'Cause we're all getting together.  And maybe going wild.  Oh yeah.  :)

"event","...I won't be here long.  It's just been so long since I've updated that I thought I should post a little of what's going on in my life.

School really isn't that busy right now.  Webmastering is nothing out of the ordinary (thank goodness for that class; I'd never get my English and U.S. History stuff done if I didn't have it), except I'm the smartest one in there.  Which, again, is nothing special.  People mainly take that class for a tech credit, so of course there will be a group of I-don't-care-about-this-class-so-I'll-sit-here-and-act-like-a-jackass kind of people, but you live.  U.S. History I'm not doing so good in.  We took a Ch. 39-40 quiz, and only <b>ONE</b> person in our entire class passed it.  Go Robbie.  :/  Ok, sure, if I read I would probably do better, but come on!  I'm lazy, and frankly, that History book puts me to sleep.  So hopefully this upcoming project will boost my C average to at LEAST a low B (hey Blaine, Kristin - remember our 60's project in 7th grade?  It's baaaaaaaaaaaaack!)  English is ok, I guess...  I've got this week to do, like, 10 books for my concept notebook.  Yeah, good luck.  Plus I have my research paper that SHOULD HAVE been turned in today, but I didn't have time to finish it, so I'm going to turn it in with the band people tomorrow, and hopefully Ms. Allen won't ask questions.  If she does, I'll just give her my spiel, and if she's still whining, then she can count it as a late grade.  As long as I don't fail it, I'm ok (though she <i>should</i> give us extra time).  Ok, the band people were out for two days in South Padre <b>having fun</b>.  They get two extra days to do their research paper.  Those of us taking the AP exams who are missing TWO DAYS of school for <b><i>ACADEMIC</i></b> reasons were supposed to turn it in <i>a day early</i>.  Yeah, so not fair.  And there's no possible way that I would've been able to get it done by Friday afternoon, so she can just take it where ever she pleases.  On an upnote, I'm doing pretty well in Physics.  I've got a butt-load of stuff due tomorrow, but Blaine can ""help"" me with the bookwork during lunch, and I can just do the online labs when Ms. Lyman's done giving notes.  Oh, and did you guys know that more people signed up for AP Physics than for AP Chemistry?  Weird.  :/  *shrugs shoulders*  Oh well, that makes me happy!  Anyway, on to math...which is really easy right now.  Derivitives are a gift from God.  And we'll be taking a test over them tomorrow, plus we've had those quizzes that I've been getting 100's on, so my grade should raise from the 81 that I have right now to a high B.  I hope.  *deep breath*  Other than that, there's not much going on at school, except for the fact that I'm ready for Summer Vacation.  And yes, that should be capitalized, because in my book, Summer Vacation is like my birthday - I DON'T DO ANYTHING!!!  Woohoo!  Oh, time to move on to a new paragraph...

...Ok, much better.  So summer...  Not going anywhere this year.  After the trip to Europe, a brand new car for my birthday, a ""free"" $180 letterman jacket, a $300 class ring, my brother's band trip to New York, and, as always, his karate expenses, I think we'll be cutting back on the budget this year.  Plus, it'll be nice to wind down and earn a few extra bucks for those inescapable shopping days.  Yes, that's right - I HAVE A JOB!!!  Kristin, you're probably the only one who doesn't know, but whatever.  I got a job at Coldstone at the Firewheel Mall, so if you're ever free from family/church/IB stuff and feel like getting ice cream, come by!  I'll be posting my schedule every week so y'all know when I can/can't do stuff.  (By the way, a ""Coldstone week"" is Wednesday to Tuesday, not Sunday to Saturday.  I know, it's weird, but they're paying me, so I don't ask questions.)  Speaking of which...  I'm working tomorrow from 7 P.M.-Close, Saturday from 6 P.M.-Close, and Sunday 6 P.M.-Close.  Just in case you want to stop by.  :)

*yawn*  Alright, I was planning on writing more, but I'm worn out.  It's 9:55 P.M. already, and I went on a walk and have been writing a new story which no one will get to read until I'm done, or maybe if I feel like letting you read it.  But just a heads-up, it's kind of a Gregory Macguire-style book.  Not the sentence format or anything, but the context.  Eh, you'll get it when you read it.  Anyway, I'm going to go.  I might update again soon!  *crosses fingers*

<3 always,
Lauren

P.S. - Oh, by the way, I'm now officially ""Mighty Midget"".  Yeah, don't ask."

"event","In the shadows
Deep within the darkness
Lay a soul drenched in isolation

And in the echoes
Of memories long gone
A voice calls out to me

Like a long-forgotten book
On a dusty, time-worn shelf
You opened me up with just one look

I'm a bird with broken wings
Can't you fix me?
I'm giving myself to you
Whole, completely
'Cause somewhere in this silence
Is a song playing sweetly
Monsieur, je ne demande qu'une chose
Can you mend a broken heart
And fix a pair of broken wings?

And though generations may look down
On two young people who have found
That life is more than meets the eye
These separating years mean nothing
To a heart hell-bent on loving
And wings yearning for a taste of the sky
Oh...

I'm a bird with broken wings
Can't you fix me?
I'm giving myself to you
Whole, completely
'Cause somewhere in this silence
Is a song playing sweetly
Monsieur, je ne demande qu'une chose
Can you mend a broken heart
And fix a pair of broken wings?

I'm ready to fly
And though I may try
I need you
Want you
Monsieur, je demande
That you take my hand
I hope you understand
That years gone by mean nothing
But a little more wisdom and loving
And these eyes are a risk I'm willing to buy
As long as I'm flying high
Flying so high

'Cause somewhere in this silence
Is a song playing sweetly
Monsieur, je ne sais qu'une chose
That love can heal a broken heart
Oh, and that's just the start
Time will heal my broken heart
And you can fix my broken wings

Oh, oh yeah
Can't you help a girl fly?
Oh, ooh
I'm ready to try"

"event","Ugh...  Poor journal, it's been forgotten for so long.  :(  *sigh*  I feel so...bleh right now.  I'm cold, hungry, my neck hurts a bit, and I'm bored beyond all belief.  Ok, so I'm not really cold, and I could easily go downstairs and eat something (except nothing sounds good, though grilled cheese and tomato soup would be nice).  My life is just a congealed mass of blahness.  Ok, ew.  I take that back.  It's a big hunk o' blah-filled boredom.  Great, now Krispy Kreme sounds good...  *sob*  Anyway, time for another sob post.

Like I said, my life is incredibly bland right now.  Nothing new to report, no secrets to keep, no one to hold me or dance with me in the park under the moonlight.  I'm grounded, don't have a job (or money), and tired of my routine.  I'm ready for college, a job, or *gasp* maybe even a relationship.  I know this is all old news for you guys, but feel like I need to contribute <i>something</i>.  *sigh*  Maybe I'll just go make a new website.  Hmmm...

Ok, now that I've taken a deep breath (or two), I'm going to do...something.  Don't know what, but hopefully it'll keep me satisfied until something or someone else can."

"event","Alright, tonight was Cotillion.  Eh.  The whole getting-dressed-up-and-seeing-cute-guys-you-know part was fun, but the dance itself was boring.  Out of our insanely humongous group from last year, Ashley and I were the only ones who came.  And Blaine was there of course...  Her and her loverly little flip flops.  :)  Oh yesh...  Anyway, so yeah, my dress was GORGEOUS, and I would've looked better, but I can't see without my glasses, so they kinda made me look more...bleh.  Oh well.  Oh, hey, you guys can't see what I looked like...  I'll post pics later.  My camera's still in my car.  Anywho...

So, about tonight...  Blaine and I met at Ashley's house at about 6:30 (well, that's when I showed up, anyway...  And you know, the party hasn't started til I'm there.  :)  Oh gosh, I sound like Zeke...).  We took pictures (sorry for mentioning my little ""pose"", guys), which was pretty fun.  Brooke was so cute...  She was our little photographer.  :)  So after we were done there, we decided, ""Hey, let's go pop up at Zeke's house and make him take pictures with us.""  So we did.  Hah, Zeke's dad told him to go get dressed...  :D  Ah, that was good stuff.  So yeah, we all rotated taking pictures since his dad was feeding the baby and couldn't take a picture of all four of us at once.  After that, we left for the dance.  It was ok...  *gasp*  Zeke, you forgot your chauffer hat!  Slacker...  Why do I call everyone slackers?  I don't know.  Whatever.  Hey, it smells like strawberries in here...  Anyway, so after the dance we all went to Fridays, which was pretty interesting.  We went from talking about ""making a funny"" to having a debate about the separation of church and state.  Yes, we're ADHD.  It's ok.  And poor Zeke got picked on...  :(  Oh well.  OH!  Our server looked just like the lead singer of Green Day!  It was weird...  Anyway, after that we went back to Ashley's house and sang along to Wicked on Ashley's iPod.  That's still not fair...  So we hung out there for a while, and Zeke stole Blaine's cell phone and text messaged me.  And he was 3 feet away from me.  Yes, he was bored...  Zeke, you're special.

So yeah, Ashley and I might be doing something tomorrow...  Oh!  Ash, I still have your jacket!  I totally forgot about that...  Anywho, overall, tonight was pretty fun.  I think I'm going to go make a new layout now...

"event","Alright, Ashley, you're not allowed to laugh, or think or say ANYTHING.  Well, ok, you can think it.  But I just felt inspired, and ran with it.  I'm actually fairly pleased with it.  Let me know what y'all think...

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
<i>Oh, oh yeah, ohhhhh

I looked into your eyes
And I saw what I was missing
Through the years I had been wishin'
For something more than just a fantasy
Oh, I know
You were made for me

And I don't wanna sound just like
Some bubblegum baby girl
But let's give it a whirl

I want you to know just how you make me feel
Everything is real
When I look into your eyes
Reality melts around me
All I see is a future with you and me
Just a perfect ending

I'm not like the other girls
And yet you rock my world
String a bunch of words and you get me
Like 1 and 1 is 3
But you still see through me
I let my guard down and you seize it

My heart is in your hands
So be gentle
I know you'll understand, oh

I want you to know just how you make me feel
Everything is real
When I look into your eyes
Reality melts around me
All I see is a future with you and me
Just a perfect

Ending with a bang
We'll be dancing in the pouring rain
And nothing else will matter
No, nothing else will matter
When I am safely in your arms

Now you know how you make me feel
Like a million clouds in the sky
Just floating away
I wonder if I'll ever get so high
And be free to love you with every single beat of my heart
This is the start

What are you waiting for?
Take my hand
I know you'll understand
If I could just find the words
Oh, those complicated words
Oh yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

And I don't wanna sound just like
Some bubblegum baby girl
But baby, let's give it a whirl...

I looked into your eyes
And I saw what I was missing

Don't waste your time worrying if people are talking about you-- you affected their lives, they didn't affect yours. Waste your time with friends-- live for the moment, laugh often, be immature, do anything and everything. If it's something you'll regret in the morning, sleep late & when you wake up, laugh about it with your friends, because your friends are what matter most.

So.  Few key words: ejaculate, sex-hair, stick, clicky, asshole.

Hmmm...  Really not much else to say.  *pout*  OH!  I love love love y'alls gifts!  Yes, Blaine, even yours...  And I'm glad y'all liked mine.  Hah, and Ashley, I had forgotten till last night, but...  I had put ""Dukes of Hazzard"" on my Christmas list!  O.O  Yeah, but now I have it...  Must...watch...I...call...Bo...  *snaps out of it*

You know what I just realized?  Oh, sorry, one sec...  I FOUND FIVE DOLLARS!  Ok, anyway, I just realized that this journal really isn't as exciting as it used to seem.  I mean, I used to write these fifty-million-word entries and update whenever I could.  But now, it's just kinda like...bleh.  *sigh*  Oh well.

You know what?  I have a new word:  ""sogj"".  It's swedish for ""sigh"".  Just thought I'd let y'all know that.

<a href=""http://www.xanga.com/private/home.aspx?user=paradise_behind_closed_doors"">CLICKY!!!</a>

Yay!  And if you send me new chapters, I'll put them there.  Kinda defeats the purpose of our SCN...  But whatever.  That way we won't have to clog up space on our precious journals!  :)  So guys, that stuff on there shouldn't be anything new (except chapters 1 & 4), but be sure to check back.  Ish is writing an amazing chapter right now, and I'm in the works of writing one myself.  So yeah...  We'll let you know when there's a new chapter up!

Anyway, Ish, here's the X-mas doll like I promised...

Stupid .gif screwed up the shading a bit, but it's ok.  I really like how the hair turned out...  Though I haven't been able to do it again...  Bleh.  Oh, and here's a random Bobman.  (Not to be confused with ""Bob the Penny"", who I just pulled out of my pocket.  Say hi, Bob.)

<img src=""http://www.geocities.com/luogo_capriccio/blobman.gif"" />

Alrighty...  So, that's my update.  I'm going to go work on pics now for the beginning of each chapter (kind of like in the Harry Potter books).  So away I go!  WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

For anyone who hasn't read that comment on Ish's journal - I may be getting a job at Starbucks!  Yay!  The manager's going to be back on Wednesday (which is <i>technically</i> my last day with my car...  But my mom changed her mind and wants me riding the bus tomorrow.  Pft.  Whatever.), so hopefully I'll have an interview that same day (although he's only in till 3:30, and I get home at about 10 till every day, so we'll see).  I <b><i>really</i></b> want a job there.  Please, Mr. Manager, hire me!  I love coffee!  I'm good at memorizing things!  PLEASE!!!  Don't let them take my precious car away from me!  Not my Tomato!  *sniff*  Dash sho shad...

"event","Alright...  Remember that theme I had not too long ago with the black background and random white spot in the corner and the title was ""Freedom of Ash""?  Well, I was just looking at some of the Notepad and Wordpad documents on my desktop, and I came across the poem that inspired the theme.  I really like it, and just thought I'd share it with you before I go to bed.

<i><h2>Freedom of Ash</h2>

If only a rose had no thorns
If only there were no clouds in sight
I'd never hurt
I'd never be left out in the rain

If only my love were as deep as the oceans
Or maybe as black as the night
I'd spread my wings, fly away
I'd never be lost inside

I must be strong
I've done no wrong
Except to myself
Where I let it all out
It's the fight within

As someone wise once said,
""We must be swift as the coursing river
With all the force of a great typhoon
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon""

Or maybe it was something else
My mind seems to wander
But nevertheless
I do protest
To the great divine called Love

I must be strong
I've done no wrong
Except to myself
Where I let it all out
It's the fight within

A shattered vase has no value
A lifeless body grows cold
A heart like this just can't exist
And be forever whole

I must be free
And break away from these chains
That hold me down at night
I must be strong
Carry on
And win this shallow fight

It's the fight within
I'm burning inside
I've done no wrong, oh no
But this fight
This shallow might
Is the ash in my hands
The dim light
That leads to my freedom</i>"

"event","Alrighty.  I guess no one is updating, and Zeke has a mysterious commenter (which is probably one of us...but I'm to lazy to guess), so I'm going to fill the journal void.  Wooh.  Big words.

So...  First off, I've decided to make a Xanga.  I doubt I'll use it for much...  Maybe I'll post my story there.  At least I'll have it all <i>somewhere</i> besides here...  You never know when one of the big-cheeses will feel evil and decide to delete my account for no reason.  And now my dog is randomly walking around the lounge...  He just walked to the corner (between the desk and the wall), then under the desk, then started to go between the desk chair and the round chair next to me, but decided against it and went right back to sniffing under the desk.  Then he left...  And now he's back.  Ah, he's old, let's just excuse his...um...randomness.  I guess he gets that from me.  :)

Secondly, I had an ortho appointment today.  Hmmm.  Well, me being my confident self, I thought last time that I wasn't getting a chain anymore.  Wrong.  But instead of it <i>just</i> going across the brackets, this one goes ALL the way across.  >:(  So I get to eat soup for the next few days.  And yes, Ashley, that means no lunch schedule for a while.  I'm gonna miss my burgers...  Which reminds me, my dad bought steaks, and he's cooking them this weekend.  If I can't chew by then without being in pain, I'm gonna be pissed...  Ooh, I have to go eat dinner!  Well, more like drink it.  Be right back...

...Alrighty, I'm back.  And my teeth still hurt.  :(  Anyway...  Onto number three.  Wait, do I even have a number three?  Hmmm...  Let me think about that for a second.  In the mean time, I'm going to check my email and y'alls journals and stuff.  Ok, I just found a ""Teach yourself Japanese"" site that I bookmarked.  It's pretty cool...

And now I have to go.  :(  Oh well, I'll see some of you tomorrow!

"event","Alrighty, I'm listening to music, updating my journal, and trying to change the layout.  As much as I like these colors, I've found my new ""me-theme"".  But, don't fret, I'm still in love with the over-all structure.  So it's just colors and the title/sub-title.  But it's always a new me, so pay attention...  :)  Ok, off to update the colors!  I'll continue this as soon as I'm done.  So if the colors are half-done (I doubt they will be, but who knows), don't worry.  It'll be normal in due time.  :)  Back in a jiffy...

...Okay, so back to updating.  I absolutely LOVE these new colors!  They're so calming and so...well, me right now.  And isn't my user pic gorgeous?  It's perfect!  I love Google now...  :)  So anyway, I'm in a happy state of limbo here.  Maybe this is the cold weather talking...  In case you haven't heard already, I love cold weather.  I even have a favorite degree - 62.  I know, I'm a loser...  But whatever.  50's too chilly for me, and 70's a bit too warm.  And according to the shrieks of my mom, we have a little, cute, harmless mouse in the house.  Mouse...house...mouse...house...  Sorry, I'm a bit easily amused right now.  We just got some cream soda (YES!!), and I've been dying for some caffeine, so I'm drinking it as we speak.  I can't remember the last time I had cream soda...  Next time we have a party, I say move over, Skittle Juice!  :)  I'm so retarded...  OH...MY...GOSH!!!  I'm looking through my dELiA*s catalog right now, and my shirt is SO in here...  It says, ""Donde estan mis pantalones?""  I'm too lazy to put in the accents and whatnot...  But I saw that, and I was like, ""Holy wow!  That's awesome!  Even if it <i>is</i> in Spanish...""  :)  I should get it.  That would rock.  Except...  Holy wow, it's $26 for a friggin t-shirt.  But the look on people's faces would SO be worth it...

Alrighty, Ashley, here's my list (and notice how <i>Caleb</i> is on it ;D):
1. Caleb Skipper
2. Micah Figueroa
3. Adam Barnard
4. Daniel Chilcote
5. Paul Herman
6. Thomas Riley
7. Jake Shepherd
8. Matt Myers
9. Kip Mooney
10. Richard Yager

Ok, well, I'm gonna go.  I have no real reason to, except for the fact that I have nothing to write about.  So I guess that's a reason.  Whatever...

Peace, Love, and Chicken Grease
~Miggie~

P.S. - Now no one can say  that I'm not updating or that my journal's lame...  I'm constantly wanting to change my color scheme, and I sometimes update.  So hah!  Take that!  Ketchup in the face!  Oh!  What now, pinkie?  :)  And here comes the caffeine rush...

"event","Hmmm...  I'm a tad bit confused.

Ok, I look at these colors (which I love, by the way - I'm not all blonde, I'm part rocker and I think boho on my mom's side), and I feel, well, different.  I've been kind of stressed lately for reasons I won't go into, and suddenly it's all gone away.

Also, in case y'all haven't noticed, Zeke posted a picture of a person - who I presume to be Mary - and him.  I don't know why, but after I saw that, I was so calm.  It's kind of eerie...  I absolutely HAVE to meet her now.  Except I'm kind of grounded until I get a job...  Oh poo.  I have until the end of November, but the sooner, the better.  Anyone know of a place that's hiring?  I might just end up trying Tom Thumb or something like that.  *sigh* Oh well.  Hey, how'd I get so off-topic?  Oh yeah, now I remember.  Anyway, long story short, everything's hunky-dory, and I have a feeling I'm going to sleep well tonight.

P.S. - That's right, no more FKS and no more Mig.  At least while I'm still sane, anyway...  I'm kinda hoping this is gonna last.

"event","Okay, so I've finally decided to update.  It's been quite a while.  I can't guarantee that this will be even the slightest bit interesting, but I'll try.

Hmmm...  I don't even know where to begin.  I may just pull an Ashley and do stream-of-consciousness...  Sure.  Why not.  So anyway, to start off with, I'm tired and hungry (even though I just ate...).  I had three tests and a horrible French skit today where everyone dies.  Eh, it kind of goes with how I feel right now.  Honestly, I really don't know how I feel.  I'm just kind of...well...here.  I feel lost and out of it, like I don't belong, but there's no where to go.  It's like I don't exist, like I'm just watching everything in my life play before me, as if in a dream.  I'm exhausted from my daily routine.  I desperately need something to come along in my life...  Something exciting, something to wake me up.  I feel dead inside, and I need something - or someone - to revive me.  I highly doubt a football game or Garland's homecoming is going to do that for me.  Not that I won't go or have fun - I'm sure I will - it's just not enough to really get me going.  I miss 8th grade.  I miss everything - from the fights to the randomness to making life-long friends.  I don't miss the fights themselves - it was the feeling I got from everything.  I felt alive, exhilirated.  It was exciting, even if it was emotionally exhausting.  I used to get a rush when I would sneak behind my parents' backs, but I've worn that out, too.  I feel like I've done just about everything.  I know I haven't, but there's just so much out there that sounds appealing, but not exciting.  I still haven't had my first kiss (I know, so sad :::sarcasm:::), I haven't gotten a real job yet...  It's all nice at first, but then everything falls back into a routine.  A kiss is just another kiss, a job is just one more thing I have to do.  I guess my life's like a worn out shoe - I love it, but I could really use something new.  I don't know...  And that rhyming's really bothering me.  Oh well.

Ok, I just felt like doing a paragraph break.  Anyway, I think I've found something that may help me get my life going again.  We're getting pen pals in France for our French class (no duh).  They're taking English right now, so what's happening is we're writing a letter <i>en francais</i> to practice our French, and then we write it in English - we can add stuff to it that we don't know how to say in French, put in slang, etc.  They then have to do the same thing, except vice versa.  It helps us both learn a foreign language, plus we both get to teach each other ""informal"" French/English, as opposed to classroom, or proper, French/English.  I don't know how old the people are, but I know they're no older than in college (again, no duh), so yeah.  Hopefully they're in <i>lycee</i> (high school).  Oh well...  I'm giving my person my e-mail address - I KNOW it's not going to be some creepy 80-year-old guy because Mr. Sennett (the other French teacher) knows the guy who's teaching the class in France from when he taught English over there.  We'll just have to see, I guess...

Oh, Ash, I've come up with 5 guys so far.  It's pretty hard, considering I don't really know anyone outside of my classes...  I mean, I'm sure I do (like Chilcote), but no one really cool that I can think of (again, except Chilcote).  So it may be a while...  Oh, and if you're reading this tonight (Tuesday), PLEASE remind me tomorrow to give you your note.  This paragraph and the last one are in it, but it's a two-page note (hey, I was bored), so there's plenty more stuff in there for you to read.  I'm not even finished with it yet, either.  Then again, I may be if I don't hurry up and finish it tonight.  *sigh*  Oh well...  Oh yeah, and Ash, are you still having your Halloween party?  'Cause I'd really like to do something this year, if y'all are free.  Wait, that's a Monday, isn't it?  Hmmm...  I'd say we could do something on that Sunday, but I think that'd be a bad choice...  :D  Maybe Saturday if nothing else?  That would be fun...  And like it says in my note, CALEB BETTER BE ON YOUR LIST!  You'll see why when you read it...

*yawn*  Well, I'm tired/exhausted, so I think I'm going to call it a night.

P.S. - I know one day I'm going to forget what ""FKS"" stands for.  Oh well.

We can put in slang and stuff in there, because we're writing to students in France who are taking English under a professeur that Mr. Sennett (the other French teacher) used to know when he taught English in France.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  I woke up to the sound of Avril Lavigne filling the borders of my small, cozy room.  As my eyes adjusted to the daylight, I checked the calendar on my cell phone which I had mistakenly left on the night before.  Today was Vlad's first party in a long time, and I would have been more excited had I been more awake.
  Pulling myself off my bed, I slipped my robe over my silk nightie and tossed my recently-dyed mahogany hair into a low bun.  Before I could walk out the door, the phone rang.
  ""Who the hell's calling at - ""  I stopped myself once I realized what time it was.  Smacking myself on the head, I answered the phone.  ""Hello?""
  ""Hi, is Fiona there?""
  ""Oh, hey Soph.  Sorry I - ""
  ""You were supposed to call me!  It's 11:45, hun.  What have you been doing?""
  I sighed and rubbed my eyes.  ""Sophi, I just woke up.  I think my brother screwed around with my alarm again.""
  ""Well, you were supposed to be here 15 minutes ago!  We were worried...""
  I was never late to a party - ever.  Since my alarm had gone off four hours late, though, I missed 15 minutes of Vlad's party.
  After hanging up with Sophi, I jumped in the shower for a quick freshening-up.  While blow-drying my hair, I rummaged through my closet.  I gave up after looking for 5 minutes for the outfit I had planned the night before; but as I turned to set the blow dryer down, I stubbed my toe on the rocking chair that sat right next to my closet door.  Looking down to see the damage I had done, I caught a glimpse of a sheer brown fabric and denim.  I felt stupid, staring at the outfit I had been looking for.  As I slipped into my clothes, I remembered laying it on the chair so I wouldn't forget it.
  Just as I was putting the finishing touches on my hair, the phone rang again.
  ""Hey Soph, I'm ab - ""
  ""Oh my gosh!  Are you sick or something?  It's been 45 minutes since I called!""
  ""I know, Soph.  I know.  I had to take a shower 'cause I wasn't about to come over looking like I just woke up, and I stubbed my toe and couldn't find that outfit I was going to wear 'til five - ""
  ""Well, you better hurry up!  If you don't get here in 15 minutes, Vlad won't...""  I could hear people shushing her in the background.
  ""Vlad won't what?"" I asked in a suspicious tone.
  ""Oh, he won't wait to start the party.""
  ""Why does he need to wait for me?"" I asked, still suspecting some plot going on under my nose.
  ""He wants everyone here, and you're the only one who hasn't showed up yet.""
  ""Ok...  Well, I'll leave as soon as I hang up, alright?""
  ""You better...""
  ""Bye.""
  I ran out the door, almost forgetting my keys.  My mind was filled with the conversation I had just had with Sophi.  Why was everyone shushing her?  Something was definitely not right.  Could it even be possible?  I decided not to get my hopes up about Vlad; every time I did, I was only met with disappointment and jealousy.

  I arrived at the party around 1 o'clock.  Vlad answered the door just as a glass shattered in the background.
  ""Dang it, Ashlyn!  I told you to wait a second!""  His sister peeked around the corner with an innocent look on her face.
  ""Fiona!"" Ashlyn squealed as she ran towards me with her arms spread.
  I knelt down as she wrapped her arms around me as far as she could stretch them.  ""Ooh, you've gotten so big!"" I exclaimed.  ""How old are you?""
  She stood there, hands together, with a giant grin on her face.  ""I'm 5 now!  See?""  She held up her right hand very proudly.
  ""Wow, a whole hand?  You're a big girl now!""
  Ashlyn tugged on Vlad's shirt.  ""Can I have my drink now?""
  Vlad took her hand as he shut the door behind me.  ""Everyone's outside.""
  As I opened the door, I heard Ashlyn and Vlad whispering.
  ""Vlad,"" she said in an impatient tone, ""when are we going to - ""
  ""Later, Ash.  I'll let you know, okay?""
  I just laughed and stepped outside.

  To be honest, I had almost skipped the party.  Since that night at Sohpi's house, things had been, well, different between Vlad and me.  We still talked, but never made eye contact.  Everything about him felt weird - I couldn't even say hi without feeling nauseous.  So when he invited me to a party, I became extremely suspicious and uneasy.  I told everyone I wasn't coming - I even explained it to them; and somehow, they were able to convince me to go.  They said that he felt bad for making me feel this way, that he knew I wondered about what was going on between us and wanted to make sure I knew that we were still friends.  I thought it was sweet and made me feel somewhat better, even though I knew that as soon as I saw him again, everything around would become a blur, and the tension and nausea would come flooding back; I was right.  It wasn't until I stepped outside into the warm sun and cool breeze that I felt better.
  I made my way across the deck that overlooked the backyard, which spanned over quite some distance.  As I headed down the stairs, Sophi looked up and smiled.  ""Fi!""
  ""Soph!"" I shouted back as Mercy and Jo turned towards me.  ""Hey Mercy!  Hey Jo!""  Mel peeked his head around in front of Jo, who was casually sitting on his lap.
  As I neared the collection of lawn chairs scattered in front of a gazebo which sat near the large pond in the back, Vlad opened the back door of the house.  ""Snacks are ready!"" he yelled as he brought out a tray and some plates.
  ""What the hell's the green stuff?"" asked Mel as Vlad set the food on the table around which the chairs were scattered.
  ""It's humus.  Just eat it.  We've also got cheese and crackers, pita bread for 'the green stuff', and a veggie platter for the health freak,"" he said as he shot a glance at Mercy.
  ""What can I say?  I love veggies.""
  ""Amen to that,"" I chimed in, grabbing a slice of pita bread and tearing off a piece to dip in the humus.  ""Wow, this is pretty good.  So what all have I missed?""
  ""Not much,"" Jo replied.  ""Mel's become my chair, and Soph almost strangled Vlad, but that's nothing new.  So really, you haven't missed anything.""
  ""That's good to hear.  So, since this is a New Year's party, how late are we going to be staying?  I presume I won't get home 'til it's techincally tomorrow.""
  ""Whenever y'all want to leave is fine with me,"" Vlad directed more at the group than at me.  ""I'm surprised my parents are even letting people stay past 9.  I think that's a first.""  We all smiled as we tried to figure out something to do.
  ""Hey, I know something we could do,"" Mel chimed in after a long, silent pause.  We all leaned in closer, as if it would make his plan seem better than it really was.  He sat for a second with a dumbfounded look on his face, before coming back to reality.  ""Oh, wait, nevermind.  No I don't.""
  We all sighed and muttered impolite words under our breaths.  ""So what were you thinking of?"" I asked, still not making eye contact.
  He had a worried look on his face, barely imperceptible.  ""Oh, it was nothing.""
  ""No, seriously!  What was it?  There's obviously nothing going on right now, so anything anyone can think of is worth a shot.""
  He got very serious.  ""Fi, drop it,"" he said in a hushed voice.  ""It was stupid and would just turn out badly.""
  ""Vlad,"" Jo chimed in, ""read my face.""
  ""Har har,"" he replied with a smirk.  ""OH.  Ok.  Hey, can you come here for a second?""  He got up and walked towards the door, not stopping to wait for Jo, who followed suit.
  We all sat there, just staring at each other.  I knew everyone else suspected or knew what was going on.  ""So what was that all about?""
  Everyone kept a surprisingly straight face, even Mel.  ""I don't know,"" Mercy chimed in.  Everyone nodded their heads.
  ""Alright guys, I know something's up and I'm being kept out of it.  Spill the beans.""
  Mel flipped out.  ""Hey, we don't know anything.""
  ""Wow, way to give it away, genius,"" I replied.  ""So what's the scoop?  Does Vlad have a girlfriend or something?  You know I'm not gonna go all 'Trigger' on him.""  I could swear I heard someone mumble ""Not yet"", but then again, I really didn't want to take my chances and make myself look stupid and self-centered.
  ""We told you, nothing's going on,"" Mercy said in her normal sweet voice.  ""I guess he's trying to steal Jo from Mel or something.""
  Everyone laughed.  ""Hey,"" Mel said, ""that's not cool.""
  Mercy smiled.  ""I'm sorry.  So anyway, what are we going to do?  It's only been...""  She paused as she looked at her watch.  ""An hour since Fi got here!  Holy wow.""
  Vlad and Jo walked back to the group and sat down.  ""So, did we miss anything?"" he asked.
  ""Not a thing,"" I jumped in.  I sat back in my seat, aware of what I thought was a sure sign to everyone that I liked him.

  Many hours passed.  The sky outside was turning a gorgeous shade of yellow to orange to pink, and the shadows of the trees fell across the lawn.  We were all sitting in Vlad's room, the door shut and a small lamp lighting the room from a corner.
  ""Hey guys,"" Vlad interrupted, ""I know it's 7, which is probably dinner time for most of us, but is anyone really hungry?""  We all shook our heads.  ""I didn't think so.  Hey Soph, what time was Leon supposed to get here?""  Just as Sophi was about to answer, the doorbell rang.
  ""I guess right now!"" she said with a smile as she got off the bed and walked out the door.  Even over the noise of the television and children running around, we could hear her yell ""Leon!"" as she opened the door.  We continued our conversations where we had stopped.
  A minute later, Sophi walked into the room and sat in a dark corner, her face low and red with embarrassment.  ""Where's Leon?"" I asked.
  She looked up with an akward grin on her face.  ""You guys, I'm so stupid.  I yelled 'Leon' before I even saw who it was.  It was the freaking pizza guy!  He gave me a really weird look.""  We all laughed at her blonde moment, and another doorbell was barely audible over the noise.
  Vlad walked towards the door.  ""I think I'll get it this time,"" he said with a smirk.  He returned after a few minutes, peeking his head around the corner.  ""Hey, Soph, it wasn't Leon, but I think this guy's just as good.""  As he walked into the room, the visitor followed behind.
  ""Leon!"" Sophi squealed as she jumped up and ran across the room into his arms.
  Vlad sat back down on his bed and the five of us continued to talk as Sophi filled Leon in about the past 7 hours.  She eventually ran out of things to say, and found a comfortable spot pressed against Leon's side on the floor.  ""So what are we going to do now?"" she asked.
  ""How about 'Spin-the-bottle'?"" Leon playfully suggested as he pecked her on the cheek, making her giggle.
  ""How about not,"" Mercy said uncomfortablly.
  I chimed in to help break the akward silence that now filled the room.  ""Hey, did you guys see that show last night...""

  The sky continued to change hue from gray-blue to light navy to black, but no one noticed as the hours flew by.  No one even glanced at the clock til a knock on the bedroom door broke our laughter.  ""What's up?"" Vlad asked as he opened the door to reveal his droopy-eyed mom.
  ""Everyone's asleep, so you guys need to keep it down.  It's 5 'til midnight, and I thought you guys might like the downstairs to yourselves.""
  ""Thanks, mom,"" he replied.  ""Good night.""
  We headed downstairs and quietly walked into the livingroom, which was lit by a single lamp as well.  Turning on the t.v. which was conveniently set to the yearly Times Square countdown, Vlad turned the lamp off, letting the glow from the t.v. give the room a unique ambiance.  Everyone sat down as if in a seating arrangement; Sophi and Leon sat on the large chair on the left, Jo and Mel sat side-by-side on the loveseat to the right, and Mercy, Vlad, and I sat on the sofa, respectively.  I leaned against the right arm and brought up my legs between Vlad and me, giving myself space to hide my inevitable tears.
  The clock at the bottom of the screen read 11:59, and the announcer said enthusiastically, ""Only 30 seconds left!  Find that special someone to kiss before it's too late...""
  ""We don't need anyone, right guys?"" Mercy said, looking at Vlad and me.
  ""Sure,"" I replied, letting out more of my sad feelings than I had intended.
  As the giant clock on the t.v. showed 00:00:10, I adjusted myself to a normal seating position and took a quick sip of my water.  I tried to keep in the tears as the clock counted down, reminding myself that this wasn't the first year I had been without a date.  I sat there with everyone else, saying ""5, 4, 3, 2, 1"" and as the moment I feared most came, I shut my eyes.  I imagined myself sitting in that same place, same time, with the same people around me.  I wondered and tried to picture what it would have been like if Vlad had just asked me that night at Sohpi's house, and it would be us kissing to the thought of a new year, my arms around his neck and his around my waist.  It seemed so real; it was as if I could really feel the warmth from his kiss.  Thinking it was over, I slowly opened my eyes.  But instead of seeing lovers kiss on t.v., I saw the face of my own.  The feeling of Vlad's lips against mine was real; I was no longer dreaming.  Remembering the outcome of the last incident, however, I pulled away gently and ran outside.  I continued to run 'til I reached the gazebo steps, throwing myself at the half-open side after reaching the landing.  I stared up at the star-filled sky, wondering why I kept letting myself get into these situations.  It was bad enough last time when I threw myself at him; but this time he came to me.  As thoughts continued to fly through my head, I heard someone climbing up the steps.  A sudden warmth came over me as a blanket fell over my shoulders.  I discretely touched my lips to make sure I wasn't falling mad again.
  ""It's cold out here.  You could get sick.""
  I turned around to find Vlad's calming face glowing like a beacon of light.  I stood there staring at the ground, not knowing what to say.
  ""I know you think I'm a kiss-and-leave kind of guy,"" he began as he put his hands on my hips, ""but I'm not.""  I kept my head down, determined to fight to the end.  Secretly - or so I thought - I was growing weak in the knees.  Gently putting his hand below my chin, he raised my eyes to his.  In the sweetest voice I had ever heard, he said, ""I want you to be mine.""  I stood silent for a second, amazed at how such simple words could make me feel so high.  I pressed my lips against his, wrapping arms and blanket around us.  We continued to kiss in the starlight, an understood ""Yes"" to the man I felt so connected to in that instant.
  I grabbed his hands and led him to the only bench on the gazebo.  He pulled off the cushions and unfolded the bench into what looked like a sofa-bed.  Putting a pillow at one end, he lay down, pulling me between him and the back, where I would be warmest.  I dragged the heavy blanket over both of us as I lay my head on his chest.  I closed my eyes, and slept peacefully under the stars in the arms of the one I loved.

I've been down this road before
I don't know if I'll make it this time

And what I know is right
I'm on the losing side
And I'm struggling to keep up this fight

For once, I was happy with where I stood
I knew everything was okay
But now you're back

And this is all I can say

Leave me alone
I don't need you anymore

I know I'm fine
Where I stand
I don't need another man
To break me down
And chain my heart
But somehow you don't play the part

You're not like the others
You're simply there
It seems so easy
And yet

I won't give in
Not this time
You're not the little love of mine

Just one more night, I'll get through the fight

But for now I lay confused
And in a helpless flight
For I still have these lies that I'll hold close tonight"

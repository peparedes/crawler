"event","Well, on Friday Cory and I were off to Biloxi. We didn't leave the house until about 4:30 pm...so we got there pretty late. We drove and drove and fianlly we were there. Now to the good stuff. When we got there (at about midnight) we met my grandmother and followed her to the hotel. We checked in and got all of our stuff in the room and finally got to relax. Well, not exactly. Cory and I goofed around until about 2:00 in the morning. When we couldn't fight it any longer, we were ready to go to sleep. We curled up in the bed and slept together the rest of the night. Then morning came. It was hard as hell to wake him up, but I did it. We took a shower and got ready to go explore Biloxi. We went to IHOP, which was the smallest place I've ever eaten in. Then we went to see my grandmother at her house. After that we went driving around and stopped at Sharkheads and bought his little sister a shirt. Then we went to The Grand (a casino and resort) and goofed off there. Night came and we went back to the hotel. It was chilly, but we decided to go sit in the hot tub and swim in the pool anyway. I didn't bring a bathing suit, so I wore a pair of shorts and his Red Bank shirt. It was so much fun. I've never had so much fun in my life....with anyone. Time to sleep. The next morning we woke up, took showers, and checked out of our hotel. The rest of the day we hung out and ate at Olive Garden. Then at about 5:00 pm it was time to head back towards Chattanooga. We had to meet my uncle in Birmingham to give him his money, so we checked into a hotel and spent the night there. We got up really early Monday morning and headed home. I had to be home by 9:30 so I could watch Cannon.

   I had a blast. It was wonderful!"

"event","Today was awesome! One day closer to going to Biloxi. I'm probably going to start packing tomorrow, but I guess I'll need to wash all my clothes before then. I also need to clean out my trunk since we are taking my car. Today I got up at 7:00 again and Cannon got here at about 7:45. I fed him breakfast and changed his diaper. Then he finally went to sleep. Not for long though. At about 11:00 Cory came over and we (Me, Cannon, and Cory) went to Wal-Mart and then to Glen Gene Deli and ate lunch. It was funny because everyone assumed that Cannon was our baby. HeHe. 

   Then we came home and Cannon took another nap. While he was napping Cory and I layed around the house and talked. We decided that on our way to Biloxi we're going to go a different way and go through Auburn. I hope we don't get lost. Although, even getting lost with Cory would be fun. 

   Well, I'm gonna go get in the floor and play with Cannon and wait for his mom to get here. I've also got to figure out when I get paid. Maybe I'll ask Kim when she gets here.

All Apoligies.....Nirvana
What else should I be
All apologies
What else should I say
Everyone is gay
What else could I write
I don't have the right
What else should I be
All apologies
In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
Married
Buried

I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezeburn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy

All in all is all we are"

"event","Today has been yucky, yet relaxing. It's nice weather to stay inside and read, but crappy weather to drive in. I woke up this morning and watched Cannon until about 3:00. At 3 I took him to Candace so I could go to physical therapy. At physical therapy I had to fill out all my information again because it has been over 6 months since I was last there. Since Liz left, my new therapist is Dorothy. I like her. She's nice and likes to talk to me while I lay there doing embarrassing exercises. HeHe I go again on Thursday where I'll start the pool part of therapy along with the land-based therapy. The only other thing that's different now is that I have to go 3 times a week instead of 2. 

   I'm not gonna get to see Cory today. DAMNIT! I guess I'll live. This Friday we're leaving to go to Biloxi. I can't wait! It's going to be amazing to fall asleep at night beside him and wake up beside him in the morning. He'll be the first thing I see. Last night we were riding in my car and out of nowhere he said...""I love you.....there's no way you could ever know how much I love you."" It gives me that funny feeling in my stomach when I think about it. I love him so much. I'm glad we got together. I'm happier now than I've ever been. I thought I was happy before when I was with Josh, but now I know what being truly happy is. It's WONDERFUL!

   Would write more, but I'm starving. Gotta go!"

"event","Well.... I've got some kind of head cold/chest cold type thing going on. It SUCKS! I went to the doctor Thursday and got my B-12 shot. She gave me antibiotics for the things that keep popping up on my skin. I told her about my hands falling asleep when I drive and she told me I have Carpal Tunnel Syndrom. I have to sleep in these wrist splint things every night so I won't sleep with my wrists curled up. On top of all that I have to start physical/water therapy again. Fun Fun!

   On a brighter note, I've been having so much fun with Cory. Today makes 2 months that we've been together. He came over last night and we watched The Day After Tomorrow with my family in the living room. Then he layed down with me because I didn't feel good. We both ended up falling asleep. We didn't wake up until midnight.

   I found out yesterday that Josh is interested in a girl from school. I'm so happy for him. The little fart won't tell me who it is though. Anyway, I'm happy that he's happy. 

   The baby is doing fine, growing and still doesn't make a sound. She hardly ever cries. She just lets out one little scream. That's it.

   Well, I'm tired of writing about my boring life. Oh, and I love the cold weather. October, November, December, and February are my favorite months. Halloween's coming up! Can't wait. Next weekend Cory and I are gong to Biloxi. Finally!"

"event","* Today was a good day. I met Cory on Signal Mountain at 8:45 am. Then we went to Dalton so he could get money from his dad. After that we went back to my house. Now to the good stuff. Although he said he wouldn't fall asleep, he took a nap in my floor. Lord it's hell to wake that boy up. I tried shaking him, breathing in his ears, kissing him, jumping on him, and finally I tickled him. I guess you can say that got him up. I wanted to talk and goof around so I'll be damned if I was gonna let him snooze. Hehe! I'm so glad he puts up with me. Anyway, after that we read some stuff out of my journal and looked at old notes that were up in my closet. It was kinda embarrassing for him to see how stupid I was way back then. After that we did the bicycle in the floor and played around. I swear I'm better at doing the bicycle than he is. Of course, I'm good at everything! Hehe....Don't I sound full of myself? Then we cuddled until it was time to leave so he could back to work. 

   Then I went all the way back up Signal Mountain to meet him at 6:00 pm and he called to tell me that he had a meeting after work that he just found out about. Of course that bummed me out. I was so excited about seeing him. Hopefully I'll get to hang out with him tomorrow. Oh well, I guess I'll forgive him. If I have to. lol 

   Last night I discovered how arrogant"

"event","Well, where to begin? Let's see. Josh and I are good friends now. Which is a hell of a lot better than hating each other. It's good that we get along. After spending two years of my life with him, I couldn't stand it if we never spoke again. On September 20, 2004 my little sister was born. Her name's Bella Rane Langford. She was 20 inches long and weighed 6 pounds 10 oz. She's the best baby ever. Never makes a peep. I've never seen a baby as beautiful as her. 

   Cory and I have been hanging out a lot lately. It's amazing how well we get along. We can say anything to each other and do anything in front of each other. The best feeling in the world is being that comfortable around someone. In a couple weeks, we're going to Biloxi to visit my grandmother. I can't wait. It will be nice to spend a whole weekend with him. Go to sleep with him and wake up with him. I love him so much. I'm satisfied with my life now. I'm finally completely happy. I owe it all to certain people and they know who they are. 

   Last night my brother had to go to the emergency room with an earache. He has an ear infection in both ears. It was pretty scary. He's doing okay now. Cory was so worried about him though. They're like brothers. I'm glad Cory gets along with my family. Of course my family adores him. Hell, who couldn't? Well, I'm gonna go update my journal on deviantart."

"event","Yesterday morning I woke up at about six and took Candace to school. After that I went back to Candace's house and watched Cannon while she ran some errands. When she got back I met Cory in front of her house and from there we had an amazing day.

   We took my car out to Hamilton Place. We really didn't have a reason to, we just wanted to ride around. From there we went back to Hixson and got Central Park. We took our food to a park and ate it there. Well, actually all of his fries ended up on the ground because he was trying to throw them in my mouth. That was probably the most fun I've ever had. Then we went to Target to look around. Once again, we didn't really have a reason to go to Target, we were just bored. Sadly, he had to go back to work so we went back to get his truck and he left. From there I went to pick up Candace from school.

   After he got off he went to the Red Bank/Soddy game. At about 11 p.m. he came over to my house. We cuddled, laughed, watched tv, took a short nap together, and talked. Then right before he was about to leave at 1 a.m, he tucked me into bed, gave me a kiss, told me he loved me, and then he left. 

   The way he makes me feel is amazing. I feel like I can say anything to him. He makes me feel comfortable. I've fallen in love with him. Today he's coming over and we're going to watch Office Space. I can't wait!"

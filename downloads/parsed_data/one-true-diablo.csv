If a tree falls down in the forest and there's no one around to hear it, does it make a noise?

----------------------------------------

RIGHT. Who is this Xoha?  I don't recall hiring anyone named <i>Xoha</i>. What kind of a name is Xoha, anyway? Sounds either Greek or Swahilian. Not as bad as yah-WEE-eh, but still! I digress.

The POINT is.  What does he/she/it/entity mean <i>does it make a noise?</i>

OF COURSE IT MAKES A NOISE!  It goes ""thwap!""

Just because no one's around to hear it doesn't mean it can't be heard! Only no one's around to hear it this time, but it still-

-it still

The tree goes THWAP.

I am Satan.

"event","V. annoyed.

Who was in charge of the F.G.D.D.F Christmas case? Just got the report this morning.  RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY HOT STONE MASSAGE.  Do you KNOW how much that guy charges per hour?  And <i>I</i> had to pay for his entire transportation fare - he lives in Seattle, for crying out loud!  I hope you're all satisfied.  This is coming straight out of every one of your salaries.  Had to bankroll it some way, afterall, and it's not like any of you are doing much work for me, anyhow. What do I employ you all for?

SOMEONE has NOT been performing up to company standards - slagging off and taking afternoon naps instead of monitoring their subjects like they're told.  Get with the program, minions!  I had PAIN and I had ANGST. I had punches thrown and flying accusations, dubious intentions, and bruised egos. I had laced chocolate goods and drunken naked.  I had polished axes and hacked off boobies and people offering up sex left and right. It was <i>supposed</i> to be a thing of beauty.  And yet. AND YET!  Two of our subjects have since gotten back together again, one even managed a semiconscious grope/cuddle and escaped the entire mess with only minor head injuries, and the other two are now working out their feeeeeeeellllliiiiiiiiings.

*slams ream of papers on the table*

Is <lj user=""one_true_diablo""> gonna have to choke a bitch?

I think <lj user=""one_true_diablo""> is gonna have to get out of this soft leather recliner and cook up some <font face=""Blackmoor LET"">OLD SCHOOL</font> Fire and Brimstone <small>(note: make sure to push dancing bimbos out of way <i>first</i>, this time)</small> because I don't think the time-out corner and dunce cap are working anymore.

You! Bob! I heard you were the one who suggested the manpris idea. My God! <small>(not literally)</small> Do you know what a manpris is? Have you ever SEEN a manpris?  They're unpredictable!  You might as well have suggested the shamrock thong again like the last time!

Bob? You're Fired. No don't look at me like that! Oh don't you DARE turn those cow eyes on me- Bob? Gah, I said stop! Bob! ...Okay, Bob, you're not fired. But I AM cutting off your chocolate rations.

Well? What are you all looking at? <b>OUT OF MY OFFICE!</b> GO BACK TO WORK YOU BUNCHA LAZY FREELOADERS! I wanna see <font color=""red""><b>blood</b></font> by five o'clock this afternoon or there will be HELL to pay. (literally!)

*sigh*

<u>New Year's resolutions</u>:
I will strive to improve the company image.
I will remember to torture and slaughter at <i>least</i> one innocent every week.
I will manage my time more effectively.
I will obliterate first and ask questions later - <i>I mean it!</i>
I will try <u>not</u> to give my customary Evil Masterplan<sup><small>TM</small></sup> speech from now on (as my victims always seem to use this time to manage their escape).
I will remember to not mix whites with colors.
I will remember to say the following lines to myself every morning: ""I'm evil enough, I'm smart enough, and goshdarnit, I can achieve anything."""

"event","Held annual office christmas party yesterday. V. boring.  My minions are slacking as of late - playing solitaire when they should be lathering the streets with the blood of virgins, gossiping about celebrities when they should be manifesting a new and terrible epidemic upon the world (honestly who cares what the Hilton sisters are doing for christmas  ...although... I hear that there may be some new celebrity babies on the way? [mental note: must check with Balthazar from accounting to see if possession of infants during high-influx season is cost feasible]).

The performance review this quarter was dismal.  Only 70/150 successful soul-binding contracts?  If our numbers keep slipping, the shareholders are going to freak.  I had to show them we still meant business by punishing one of our own: Gorgon the Destroyer. Poor sod. He's been relegated to nursery duty at the local birthing center.  Most disturbing thing is, he seems to enjoy it.

Aaaaaanyway.

We celebrated the official beginning of christmas by way of ritual sacrifice of a priest and then filling the punch bowl with his blood.  Oh, and who was the idiot intern who selected the music, by the way? <b>I shall have him eviscerated</b>.  The only highlight of the whole evening was when Bill the Succubus spiked the blood punch with prozac. Oh that Bill, he's such a prankster. Though I don't know if Randal the Harbinger will ever recover from the incident.

Well, must skedaddle.  I'm having afternoon tea with Balrog Phil.  You won't believe how testy he gets when his tea party plans don't go exactly the way he wants them to."

Feh.

He does that everytime he thinks he's losing more worshippers (talk about an ego).  You only have to see him if YOU want, I had to live with that entity for milleniums.  Do you know how hard it was to watch him fall for the lot of you, to always want but never succeed in pleasing him, to be the black sheep, the middle child, the recluse,  the WEIRD ONE TWIRLING THE FORK IN THE CORNER? DO YOU??

*HAWWWWK*

Confessionals are for LOSERS.

Air your laundry here, all under the safe cloak of anonymity.

Someone giving you grief?
Were you told a secret that you're just DYING to tell?
Feel like spreading a rumor?
BNFs bossing you around again?

GO FORTH AND BASH.

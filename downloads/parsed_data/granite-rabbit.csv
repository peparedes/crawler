this last weekend was the best weekend

friday after work i went to a really good party. saturday i had work then prom.  everything about prom was so fun and awesome im so happy i got to go and i had the best time ever.  we went to morton's steak house for dinner and the dance was at promo west.  afterwards we went to afterprom and after that partied at jason's. im glad everything worked out the way it did and after a while of waiting everything came into place.  it was the best of the best: i ate filet mignon, smoked a real cuban cigar, drank lots of beer, hung out with good friends and the girl.  sunday however i was still really sick and elevated when i went into work so that was really miserable.  monday i went to cedar point with mallory, diane and eddie.  also most of our senior class was there which was nice.  i rode most every major roller coaster in the park, even the water ones.  all in all the most fun ever.  im going back to cedar point next wednesday on a physics field trip.

this is so far the most fun time of my existence."

this post has nothing to do with anyone else but me because the future is making me freak balls right now

mmmk.
i gotta decide between new york, california, and tennessee.  The three big music states.
im pretty sure im going to nyu but who knows.  Nashville is just as cooking as new york city in terms of the music scene so this is tough.  The only reason i would go to santa clara is mondo scholarshiz, but they dont have the best guitar program, but my grandma lives there and you can see the ocean...mmmmm...
i think i need to experience more of the world before i return to california...the future is freaking me out.  im goin on site visit to the village on april 21...damn manhattan is scary

"event","props to carlo for getting me back into good hip hop.  a huge thank you goes to him for taking the time out of his busy schedule to burn an underground sampler for me.  just like out of the kindness of his heart n shit. really sweet.  not like cool sweet but like sugar sweet ya know?

i cut the arms off of another shirt today.  its getting out of control and if i keep going like this, i wont have any shirts with sleeves left.  somebody needs to sponsor some kind of intervention to help me, cause im a fiend.

generous american beauties press their soft lips to the magnolian charge of the sky

i think that sentence i just wrote is kind of beautiful

i think this sentence isnt so beautiful:

you're making a funny face, fag

leah was sick today and i hope she feels better cause shes a dog.  today in gym, i fucked this kid up in dodgeball, nailed him right in the face...he had to go to the nurse and everthing.  i kind of feel bad about it but when you get down to it thats the nature of sport and we all just gotta deal with the guilt of fucking somebody up every once in a while.  but its just gym anyway.

i pushed my moms car all the way up the hill that is emerald parkway today in the fuckin frozen tundra.  that was rough.  but its all good.


i want to connect with everyone at the same time but its not possible.  there must be some kind of illicit drug i can take that makes this possible for me.

final thought:  it seems like lots of people have been whipping out this move:  ""so i was walkin down the street and i saw a dog.  I was surprised because said dog was break dancing.""
ya know, like referring to the noun (dog) with ""said"" in the next sentence?  whatever kind of language fad this is i dunno...i mean i know its not like a fad but ive been seeing it a lot in the youth as of late.  All i can say is that it makes whatever you're saying seem a lot more esoteric and complex, makes you seem smarter than you really are.  okay im changing it to this:  ""so i was maxin in my basement and jackie chan busted through the ceiling.  I was upset because AFOREMENTIONED ceiling had just been repainted!"" Oh snap, lets see if that catches on bitches.

real world is almost on and im out"

"event","hi. i got a funny email today:
Thanks for your e-mail, Paul.  I enjoyed your audition CD very much 
and based on that and your SAT score, you would be accepted to the 
Blair School. The Bach Prelude had a very nice flow to it as did the Carulli, but you might want to check the score on some wrong notes in Lagrima, specifically:
1st measure, 3rd beat, bass with P should be g-sharp not g natural
ditto 3rd measure
7th measure, 3rd beat in upper part should be d sharp not d natural
also at end of the e minor section the g is natural in the chord 
not g sharp so it ends in the minor not major key.
You should hear within a few weeks of your acceptance to Vanderbilt and in the meantime if you have any question, please e-mail 
me.
Prof. John Johns
wow
guess i fucked that shit up! my bad.  in my defense tho, this fucker can be interpreted to have the g sharp and the g natural interchangeable so as to end in major which would follow picardy third protocol.  that sounds like a crock of shit but i swear i didnt make it up.

anyway.vandy woo.deep south.woo?i dunno.but nashville man huge music there i guess.
CARLO GAVE ME A BEAUTIFUL GIFT
thank you so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much SO much
he came into my work to give it to me and everything it was totally fucking selfless and sweet hes a dog.  i will repay the favor somehow just let me think of something cute.

we played norton middle school in the funkiest part of the city on friday..it was so fun but at the same time a strange experience.  It's such a poor part of town.  When we got there the principle told us that a rival gang fight betwixt the two latino gangs in the area was going down and if any white folks interfere there would be trouble.  So once we and danny were done we packed our shit and got the hell outta dodge.  As we were packing our stuff a buncha kids in the lot adjacent to ours were just beating the shit out of eachother it was rough...I think most of the kids liked the show except for this one girl who was like ""can i have your autograph? PSYCH!""  hehehe what classic wit! top drawer...we made a bunch a money.  Then that night was the basketball game against westland which is in the same area and the same cops that were chaperoning the dance were there looking after all the westland kids.  bizarre...good thing evan didnt say we were from dublin that woulda been bad.  
Saturday was sweethearts and it was SaWEET.  I had so so so much fun it was rad and extreme and bitchin and so forth.  I love love to dance.  anywaaaaaaaaayyyyy i have work at 5.  happy valentine's day.  maly gave me the sweetest picture in a nice frame an everythin.  woot"

the perfect flaw (my band) is playing again at second spin record store on friday the 7th
if you dont have anything to do, go cause it should be a killer time
even if you were at our last two shows (which is a lot of folks)
because we'll be showcasing at least two new bitchin tunes
also another reason to come out and support is that after this show, if enough people go we'll have enough money to record at columbus discount records.  if we make the cash well have it out by the end of january/beginning of february.

...i did not really like the campus...it was all brown...
the audition went well though...the professors were both jazz to the core so they didnt really have any constructive criticism technique wise for my classical selections...EXCEPT...that ""my interpretations of the pieces are a little dry""...i played them note perfect but lacked dymanics...it was kind of a waste to go all the way out there just for that but still it was good experience for a real audition...
there was also a theory workshop...blah

i drove home and went to media play and FINALLY bought another copy of one nation under a groove...

my dad came home for lunch and he brought home steak'n'shake food.
when i think sns i dont think food
i just got back from a huge long adventure just now

i went to north high st. to drop off the following materials to a contact willing to take them off my hands:
stereos (2)
speakers (4)
television (1)
vcrs (3)

the dropoff point was behind a warehouse and it was scary and the contact and his constituents were scary
after i made the dropoff my road home was closed for construction so i had to take a detour to get back to 315...i didnt follow the signs right and got lost for a long time...a long time...i saw pretty much everything in columbus there is to see...now im back

good example: pat metheny...way back last may i went to b&n to get one of his albums but carlo convinced me not to...that was maybe the worst decision of my life and i'll remember it forever...i got larry carlton's new album though...it's clear that his label is totally infringing on his creative output...just listen back a few years to ""the gift"" or ""well done"" there's a huge difference in style and freedom...

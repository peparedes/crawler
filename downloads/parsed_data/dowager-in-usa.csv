Did anyone read the NY Times piece on Interpol? On how they're all grown up? 

1) REST MY CHEMISTRY

I need to find a new young boyfriend so we can break up and I can listen to this song on loop until I jump off my 27th floor balcony. I already have a 22-year old candidate who is impossibly tall and skinny who already dresses like he should be in Interpol. Like a daisy in my lazy eye...

<lj-embed id=""2"" />

2) ALL FIRED UP

I need songs to strut through various airport terminals to... this one'll do nicely. I've got this soul. It's all fired up. So many airports this summer. So much strutting. So much soul. You're all mine.

<lj-embed id=""3"" />

3) SCALE

I shall read on my balcony in the evening-time while listening to this song. I will look into the distance at the stormy sky (there's ALWAYS lightening somewhere it seems these days on the plains) and feel nice at the top of the world.

It's coming across the prairie and will surely devour us all. 

It has only begun to devour me and I fear that 2007 will be much like 2004 was. 

At first I will hate it and I will moan. I will make vain attempts to cast it away but by the time the cold and grey of the Minneapolis winter sets in, it will be all over. This is part of their genius, perhaps...? Release a record in summer so we can all discount it and hate on it for the first few months but when we find ourselves too lazy and melancholy to leave the house come September/October, we put it on the old hi-fi and realise that we, from that point forward, will listen to nothing else.

I shall listen to NOTHING ELSE.

Behold! THE NEW INTERPOL RECORD WILL KILL US ALL!

(P.S. I like getting killed)

We're doing Xmas in America for the first time in a decade or so and I miss them terribly so I reckon a month with them in the warm weather couldn't be such a bad thing.

So.... Thanksgiving and Xmas in Beverly Hills... and then New Year's in New York! With a hopeful move back to London come early 2007! These are the plans!

I will probably try to throw together some small going away drinks or tea party. As of now, estimated departure date is around November 16th.

And if anyone wants to accompany Saydee and myself down the coast (we'll be stopping in PDX and SFO), let's chat. Road trips are fun!

I looked him in the eyes just before we collided. He made no effort to stop.<br /><br />My car spun on two wheels and slammed down on the curb. Said man ran from the scene ON FOOT. I got out of the car and collapsed to the ground. Hysterical in tears and shock, a battalion of large housewives came to my aid and rang 911. The man who hit me was driving a stolen car and has yet to be found.<br /><br />I've fractured my collarbone (see below) and bruised my elbow. I'm forbidden from working or doing much of anything for the next two weeks. My mum is flying in and moving in to The Sorrento to nurse me/drive me fucking batty. And the pain... well, the pain is truly fantastic. I don't have words to describe how wretched I feel.</p>
<p>Everyone says ""At least you have the painkillers!"" Well, the ""painkillers"" really only make me drowsy... so I nod off... only to be woken up by the pain only a few minutes later. </p>
<p>I should also probably mention that Wednesday was my 27th birthday... which I spent in the E.R. surrounded by Kim, Corey and Corey's boyfriend (who is a lovely nurse... but a stranger nonetheless who cleaned up my vomit and saw me cry).</p>
<p>This has truly been a miserable week. Nice to have all my friends and colleagues come out of the woodwork to bring me things and offer help... but please PLEASE stop bringing me food. I have more cookies, cakes and sushi than any one man should.</p>

LETS ROCK AGAIN! 

LET'S ROCK AGAIN is an intimate and fascinating portrait of JOE STRUMMER -- the undisputed pioneer of punk and legendary frontman for The Clash. Directed by filmmaker and long-time Strummer friend Dick Rude, LETS ROCK AGAIN! provides an insiders view including touching personal interviews, revealing backstage footage shot in the 18 months leading up to Strummers death in 2002. The film begins with a montage of Strummers illustrious start as frontman for the iconic punk band The Clash and moves into his life years later as the documentary hits the road with Strummers new band The Mescaleros. 

After the film, we will also screen Dicks documentary on the first 5 years of LA Punk, XEROX BABIES.

Dick will also be there in person to answer your questions and grace your presence with his general awesomeness.

Come kick it with an LA legend and see what he has to say about a ROCK GOD.

She worked HARD for that ticket price and bless her, she earned every penny.  Still too shocked to really discuss it.  San Jose, however, is the arsehole of the world. I hope never to return."

"event","Whirlwind weekend. San Francisco is radical. Some bulletpoints as I am too hungover to think in any other fashion.

* Mogwai was a blisteringly good show and the contact high from all the stoners around us only enhanced the experience.

* Jennifer is the greatest thing in the world. 

* Nadine is also the greatest thing in the world with the most comfortable bed on the planet that I have YET to move from today.

* San Francisco is beautiful. The boys are cute and aplenty. And all cute people want to do here is LAY IN THE PARK.

* We spent all day Sunday and a good portion yesterday laying in Dolores Park. There is a man who walks around with these buckets selling mystery food to parklovers. Nadine and I clapped and thought they might be dim sum... but oh no... wait for it... they were WEED TRUFFLES. In SIX different flavours! I got a cinnamon, a coconut and a ginger pecan. Normal human people need only eat half of one. In my traiditonal gluttonous manor, I ate THREE. I have never been so stoned in my life. Jennifer walked me all around San Francisco in the hopes that I would ""come down."" No such luck. We rented movies but as soon as ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" came on to the screen, I got way too confused and panicky. TOO STONED.

* Yesterday involved additional recovery from the too-stoned-ness. TOO STONED! We went to the beach and I fell in love with love and decided I need to go to the beach OFTEN. Then more drinking of the white wine in Dolores Park with a gaggle of hipsters. DO THEY EVEN HAVE POLICE HERE? I ATE MARIJUANA AND DRANK ALCOHOL IN PUBLIC. There was also croquet. 

* Went to Nadine's club night. Got way too drunk. Woke up in underpants spooning Nadine.

* Today I watch telly and prepare myself for MADONNA. Tonight. In San Jose, even! Wheeeeeee!

I need rehabilitation. I also wish I could live my entire life in my underpants.&nbsp; Nadine's house-mates don't seem to mind.

Back to the bed!!!!!"

3-4 days a week. It pays decent and will most likely become a full-time salary gig in the next few months. Just feeling out candidates right now and trying to ascertain just how much support I need...

I handle all things PR, CR and GR for EMP, SFM and now... DT.

If you don't know what those acronyms mean... it might be a wrong fit.

"event","We hosted the Memorial for the remarkable Octavia E. Butler last night at the museum and I had the distinct pleasure of delivering Samuel Delany's eulogy and also reading a passage from my favourite essay of hers (that she wrote on occasion of the 2001 UN Conference on Racism) to close out the speeches. 

Standing at the podium in front of her 200 family, friends, fans and fellow SF authors (I mean... these are all authors I've been reading since I was a kid) I, by some miracle, didn't burst out into tears... I was pretty much the only one who didn't. When I got back to my seat and Vonda McIntyre read, however, I lost my shit.

It was a lovely evening in rememberance of a formidable woman and great American mind.

It was nice to be inspired and sit in an audience of so many different types of people... black, white, straight, gay, young, old... and celebrate the work and inspiration of a woman who spoke not only for other black women... but for the disenfranchised everywhere. Octavia Butler, for me at least, epitomised the American experience and was/is a truly exceptional and key American voice not only in the sci-fi canon... but in that of American literature on the whole. She gave a voice to generations of people who dared to dream of the way life should be... and who dared to admit how frightened they were of how it most likely will turn out.

You can read about the night's activities and get some other great highlights in the extended features written in both The Seattle Times (out today... cover of LOCAL section) and Seattle Post-Intelligencer (coming out tomorrow). 

If anyone wonders where to start if they'd like to read Ms. Butler... I suggest starting with her short story <i> Bloodchild </i> or her novel <i> Kindred </i> or even delving in to the great Patternist series (which starts, in the order it was meant to be read at least, with <i> Wild Seed </i>).

COSI FAN TUTTE = BITCHES BE LIKE THIS
Hos are hos and they can't be trusted. 

This Jonathan Miller (Sir to YOU, buddy!) production should not be missed. Even if you hate it... which many will... it's Mozart's best. Sez me, at least.

It's funny, relevant and set in the present day. It's about two guys who don't trust their girlfriends so they fuck around with them but (arguably) end up getting fucked themselves in the end. It's fairly disturbing, actually... but you'll laugh.

I have an extra ticket for March 10th if anyone wants to join. I got half off the ticket and they're the best seats in the house."

I hate Valentine's Day. Only really ever had one once... My first boyfriend ever that I lived with back in Oxford. I miss him lots.

But it would appear that I have a Valentine this year and we're going to go see this tonight!

Ralph Fiennes will always and forever be my greatest valentine.

Last night I stayed in, cleared out some Tivo (You know what show is officially DONE, by the way? Desperate Housewives. Stick in the fork and all that business.), ate some roast chicken, drank some of my Cote-du-Rhone, snuggled by the fireplace with Mme. LaSaydee and then went to sleep in my brand new sheets. I want to do that EVERY NIGHT.

Work is annoying today."

I have tickets for both Tracy and the Plastics and for the Ballet on Friday night because I am stoopid. I'm really dying to see the new ballet production so I'm offering up my Tracy tickets to anyone who wants them...

The show is this Friday at The Frye and the show is sold out!

They are $15 each and they are available... Anyone wanna go? Ring me, e-mail me or ping me here!

"event","A couple weeks ago I got an internship to work for a lady who is a real entrepreneur.  She has her own website, makes dvds, teaches children, dives, teaches about photography and videography... pretty much everything.

I am working on a section of the site called ""Cool Scientists You Should Know.""  What I do is research scientists and interview them, then each week a new one is featured on the page.  It involves a lot of writing because I have to rewrite the e-mailed question interview into something that grabs the reader and is intriguing and creative.

So far, I am finding that my writing is way too scientific and professional.  It's technically for children to read, so I really have to grab their attention.  I'm really lacking on the creative side.

It's really fun to learn something new tho... maybe one day I can learn to be a journalist, especially through this internship.

It's pretty cool tho.  She's really nice and wants me to do extra things with her like go to conferences and attend meetings.  She told me today that every first wednesday of the month she wants me to come in business attire to go with her to a Women in Communications meeting, since I am one now.  Interesting.  She also wants me to go diving with her, and maybe eventually she can help me get more certifications since she's a diving instructor.

But yeah, as of right now I'm pretty irritated at my lack of creativity and the way I tend to use the same words over and over, but it's a work in progress.

Growing up, you were always the one that pushed me and helped me do better.  You are a mentor and a great friend to me, and I wish I could have been around to spend more time with you before now.  You inspired me in dance and in life, and I will always strive to have your spirit and your vitality.  You are a testimony to dance and everything it can give a person: health, joy, friendship, emotional expression.

My mom took class from you even before I did.  We both feel a deep connection to you and we both miss you so much.  You have given me so much, and I hope that my family, the rest of the dance studio, and I have given even an ounce of that happiness back to you.

Anyway, I should be finishing up studying for my Aquatic ecology class but I don't wanna. I'm ready for summer. Who's with me?

I'm gonna try and apply for a Science Teacher/Summer Camp Counsellor position at the zoo.  I'm pretty excited about it.. we'll see what happens.  If that doesn't work out I can probably easily get a job as a counsellor for the Sea Center or just the Museum of Natural History summer camps since I already ""intern"" there.  I say ""intern"" in quotes because I pretty much do the same exact thing the high school volunteers do -_-.  They were supposed to hook me up with connections but never did, so I keep pestering them to do more stuff.

I've done a couple elementary school science nights now and they're pretty fun.  Too bad it's Museum of Natural History stuff... bones and pamphlets and stuff under glass boxes.  Kinda boring for the kids but I try my best to make it fun.  Last time we were unfortunately in the same room as a guy with a huge red tail boa around his shoulders, and the REEF touch tank (from UCSB) was right outside... so we were a bit overshadowed. sigh.  I wish I was working at the touch tank instead, but then again I don't really specialize in inverts.  Fish are my deal.  Screw petting a whale, I'll pet a trout :-P (as my aquatic ecology professor two quarters ago suggested, lol).

Oh I also feel like posting this... late one night I was thinking about what qualities people in love have, and these are some of the things I came up with.

Complete Trust
No Inhibitions
They make you feel special
You want and see what is best for them and will help them achieve it
Accept and embrace their faults

"event","The following is an actual question given on a University of Liverpool chemistry final exam.

The answer by one student was so ""profound"" that the professor shared it with colleagues via the Internet, which is why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well.

Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's law that gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed or some variant.

One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.

As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that, if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell. Because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay constant, the volume of Hell must expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.

2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Sandra during my freshman year, that ""it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,"" and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is endothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is extinct ... leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being - which explains why, last night, Sandra kept shouting ""Oh my God.""



THIS STUDENT RECEIVED THE ONLY ""A""."

Soo I spent the weekend in Ventura.  I went to a cousin's wedding, and basically met everyone on my dad's side of the family.  The last time I saw them I was rather small, and I have an awful memory to begin with, so I pretty much didn't remember anyone.  The wedding was in the Ventura mission, which is quite beautiful.. I dont think I had ever been to that mission... though I've been to quite a few over California.

I thought that the priest's homily was rather preachy.  Instead of talking about love and how wonderful it is, he basically lectured everyone about abortion and contraceptives... I found it very inappropriate.  Regardless it was a nice ceremony, since the church was very pretty.

The reception was fun, I got to get acquainted with my family, which was definitely nice.  Matt also showed up for a while, and it was really nice of him and great to see him.  Later on, a few of us were standing outside and we talked to these two people that were pretty much the most amusing people I have ever talked to.. we even had some really meaningful conversations.. it was just a nice time.. especially since pretty much everyone was drunk.. It was kind of surprising to have such in depth conversations with them.... but it was a ton of fun.

By the end of the night my feet were killing me, since they were squished into these REALLY cute shoes :-P, but we finally left around 1, and my parents and I ended up at Denny's.... and it was really nasty.  Dennys isn't usually that bad.. but...  yeah it was bad.  Maybe it's just cause I wasn't with you guys :-P

So today we ate at Joe's Crab Shack, which was really good, then we went and looked at some houses in Ventura we'd looked at a couple years ago, but they didn't have models at the time.  A few hours later we put down some money so they would hold one for us.  It may not end up going through, but then again it may.  I suppose we'll see what happens.

You guys would visit me there, right?  It's like 10 minutes from the ocean... it'd be tons of fun.. and itd be easy to take a train there!

Just keep in mind that it's not even near for sure yet.. so don't get too upset :-P.  This is something my mom has wanted for like 10 years.. and this is the furthest we've ever gotten.  My parents really need to do something for themselves to make them happy.. so I'm happy for them.  I'm still definitely nervous tho. If it does happen, it will be very hard for me to leave the house I've lived in and grown up in for 20 years.  I've never moved completely.. so it will be a very different experience... plus all of my friends here... I love everyone so much and I miss you guys enough as it is when I'm in SB.. sigh.

I didn't hear any spoilers before I read and finished the final Harry Potter book, so I'm happy.  The way they ran the midnight party this year was stupid. I guess the fire department got mad at them last year, so they were really strict on how many people they let in.  My mom and I got there around 9:30, but we couldn't get in because they were already over maximum capacity, which was 250.  250 people is not very many for that huge building. That's a bit ridiculous.  As people came out, they weren't even letting others in, and they weren't counting how many were leaving.. so it was just silly.  Finally we got in when they let only a few people in, but I felt bad because all of my friends had wandered off.. so I kinda ditched them. Sorry guys :(  Anyway, at 11 they made everyone go outside, which was really stupid, but I guess since everyone couldn't be inside that they couldn't just call groups as they had before... anyway, that was pretty dumb.

I read a little bit of the book that night, but I had to wake up early because I was sub-assisting three combo classes (3-7 year olds) at the dance studio early the next morning.  Let me tell you.. some people should not be parents.  So many of these kids had no respect... it was just unbelievable the things I saw.  There was a pair of girls that were GOSSIPING like high schoolers in the last class, then one of them talked back to the teacher... and there was another girl that kept telling us what to do.  These are FOUR year olds.. it was just ridiculous! It was obvious where they got their disrespect from though, because all the parents sat inside the classroom talking as loudly as the could... which also distracts the kids.  They kept running over to their parents, and we couldn't really say anything because the normal teacher lets them do that.  It was just a nightmare.

When I went home, Matt surprised me and took me out to lunch, which was really sweet of him.  We went and got yummy chinese food.. it was good seeing him.

After that I read all day... gave myself a headache... didn't finish since I got such a late start.. but I finished the next day.  I must say that I really liked it, even though the beginning half was a little bit slow.  In the end it was just genius... except the last chapter was a little cheesy... but satisfying still.  Just think she could've made it a little less contrived.

Anyway, I would've been back online sooner, but Saturday our internet died for no reason, and they couldn't come out and fix it until today... completely ridiculous.. but whatever."

"event","soo not too much to report here besides the fact that I had a fantastic Valentines day.

The day before Valentines day, he surprised me with two dozen roses with carnations and baby's breathe in this really huge, gorgeous vase.  He even arranged it himself.  That same day I got a flower delivery from my parents, and they're really pretty too.

The next day (actual Valentines day) I had a bad day because I had a bio lab quiz right before my Plant physiology midterm.. and then I went and got my car and picked up The Departed (movie) so I could give it to him... and I spent the rest of the day decorating a corny little box with pictures and stuff for him.

We went downtown to try and go to some nice restaurants, but he didn't make reservations because he didn't think any place would take them, so we ended up at the Santa Barbara Brewery, which was still really good. When we were done, even though I told him how full I was, he insisted on getting dessert to go.  When we got back to campus, he pulled his comforter out of the back of his car... and I could hear something else making noises underneath, but I didn't say anything.  He told me we were gonna go eat dessert on the beach!  So we went down there, and he made me turn around.. and I could hear clinking noises while I stood there.  When I turned around, he had put candles inside champagne glasses and lit them.. so we had a candlelight dessert.  It was so sweet!

So yeah, that was my nice Valentines Day.  That weekend my parents came to visit so we hung around downtown and such.. it was nice seeing them.

Then this weekend me and Matt went to the Take Action Tour at the hub, and Red Jumpsuit Apparatus performed... they were pretty good but Emery put on a really great show.. and there were a few other bands there that were also really awesome.  It was way too loud tho.. much louder than it should've been because it just kinda sounded distorted and not good at points.. but whatever.. it was still good. My ears were ringing until last night.

And now I have to go back to bio lab for a 3rd time to finish this stupid experiment. Why are the 1 and 2 unit classes the most involved? It sucks. Busy busy busy. Wish I could get myself to do work......"

"event","Yay for a 3 day weekend!  After last week it feels like we've been here for 2 or 3 weeks... not just one.  My schedule basically sucks... but I'm dealing.  They cancelled my physics lab I was in, so I had to find a new one that was open (which is impossible at this point) since the one they moved my class to was during my OChem lab.  So now I have two late night labs. Joy.

Let me just say that plant physiology is the most boring subject ever. I can't even sit there for an hour listening to it... it's soooo boring.  My ecology class is pretty fun tho.. the professor is really funny and great. I love finding funny professors.. it makes it so much easier to learn.

So... my old phone broke.. I've only had this one for about 6 months or something.. I sent the last one in and the warranty covered sending me a new one.  Instead of doing that again just to have it break, I decided to get a new phone.  As a result, I lost some of my phone numbers.  I didn't have all of my numbers saved to my sim card, so the ones that weren't were lost.  I can just take the sim card out of my new one and put it back in the old one, but I already did that once and dont want to do it again.

So please, send me your phone numbers so I can contact you. I'm actually only missing a few because some of them I knew by heart... though I'm not so sure I got it right.  Either leave your number in a comment if you're comfortable with that or e-mail it to woodlandfairy@umail.ucsb.edu  (make sure you spell fairy right.. not the way my lj name shows.)

I went out twice this weekend.. it was decent.. but the first night I got really sick to my stomach and had to go back before I wanted to, and last night I was just tired so we went to the Disney party for a little bit, then me, Matt, and Brenda left.  Luckily Matt drove so we didn't have to walk in the FREEZING cold.

It was so warm at the beginning of this week.. people were wearing shorts and tank tops, and now the wind is blowing freezing cold air. Sadface.  I must say it was weird to come from freezing cold Palmdale to nice warm Santa Barbara... it was like I stepped forward in time and seasons or something.

Sadly enough, I have to do some homework today after eating, so I'd better get going."

"event","So... last quarter was hard. Really hard.  I tried so hard and was still in fear of failing 2 out of my 3 main classes (excluding labs).  Luckily, I just barely passed them. I was so shocked because I was expecting at least one of them to be a DEFINITE fail.  Thank god for good curves.

My house in Manzanita is kind of antisocial and it kind of saddens me.  I get a little depressed sometimes because I'm not really friends with anyone that's a lot like me.  It's like I'm from a different group of people than everyone else, and I kind of get left out.  I'm dealing with it fine though. It's not a huge deal.

Everything with Matt is going really well.. we're best friends and that's what's most important.  I love how we tell each other everything and are completely honest with each other.  He just spoils me too much sometimes and it makes me feel guilty! I've never been treated so well.  You mean the girl ISN'T supposed to pay for everything?!  He's so sweet tho... he puts up with all my whining (which I kick myself for doing afterwards) and all the rough times, and I do the same for him. It's great.  He's such a smart guy too.. it's nice having him around :)  I went up and visited him last week.. all we did was lay around and watch TV and movies, and it was so relaxing.. it was a bit of a getaway for me.

Christmas break has been decent.. it's been a little hectic around my house because my mom hasn't been feeling very well at all.. but we're managing just fine.  The eve before Christmas eve Matt came up and we went to one of our crazy family friend parties... Matt was mixing ""Dirty Girl Scouts"" for everyone, and he was the life of the party.. everyone loved him.. it was great.  After that we went down to Jason's crazy decorated street for a little while and hung out with everyone.

Lately I haven't really been doing anything.. I haven't seen all my friends as much as I've wanted to, but the times I have have been fun.  The break felt way too short.. I need at least another break to recover. I'm signed up for 20 units for next quarter... most likely going to drop one of my classes so I have 16.  Anyway, all I've been doing is playing WoW (I'd much rather be doing more fun things though) and loading up my new ipod.. which is taking forever.

Definitely gonna go out a bit more this quarter and have more fun. I've been too antisocial and working really hard.. but I still have to work harder.. we'll see how that works out. I dont wanna go back. I'm dreading it. meh."

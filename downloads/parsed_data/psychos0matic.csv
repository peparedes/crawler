It was fuckin great man... I bet neither of them will remember it either... wow tomorrow's gonna be a shocker....damn dude.... craziness....I wish I could remember somethin... the last thing I remember is Rene's parents finally coming home from dinner... and they were like ""We smell alcohol"".... and I believe them cause I spilled so much like 4 times.... but not intentionally.... people kept knockin over my cup.... douche bags.... and my shot glass... but yea... we told em Rene was sick cause he ate some old pretzels or somethin like that....ahahahahahah... think they believed us??? Anyway I think I called Brandon and he never called me back like he said he would... and I think Rene called Melanie... ahahahahah.... I bet she got so pissed over that.... but oh well...hmmm....

"event","Why is it that everyone is a muther fuckin two faced douche bag? They either start out as one... or slowly become one... all these fuckin people I know seem so cool... but as the days come and go... I get to know them better... then wish I really hadn't... they talk about how they'll always be there for their friends... but then as soon as that friends back is turned... they talk shit... oh... and they talk about thinkin for themself... but then if a majority of their friends doesn't like a certain person... they go along... even though they hardly know the person... I fuckin hate it all...such hypocracy being committed right before my very eyes... and I really am tired of watching..."

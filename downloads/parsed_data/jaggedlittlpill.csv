"event","Today was really exhilirating
I got out of bed i was having a dirty dream

I feel sad, because Sarah and Britney are complete bitches. They told everyone I have an STD, just because I slept with both of their boyfriends on Saturday night.

I'm so horny

Last night I had to masturbate twenty times. I'm so horny. Click here to see my website.

I want to tell the world to get fucked.

I am really annoyed with those assholes at _are_you_hotter_than_us_?, because I am so much cuter than them, and those photos don't do me justice. They can't reject me, so I'm starting my own rating community. Click here to join (the first five applicants are automatically accepted).

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! look at my *****

I want to say thanks to simon and Abbey and Dave and the other Simon for helping me on Saturday. You guys are the best. By the way, if you happen to find my wallet, keys or underwear, could you SMS me? Adrian has my number. 

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said i have anal warts And bipolar disorder.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you what your favourite sexual position is.

i've been tring to do this thing without my chinese exchange behinf\d me getting a long enough chance to read what i've actually been doing :P lol

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with my favourite Buffy fan-fiction piece I wrote last year when I was in hospital.

"event","OMG,!!!!!!!!!!!!! my final entry before my trip to china. well.....my mum had this stupid idea of wanting me to tell my dad that i was going to china, when in fact i couldn't care less, its just that she doesn't want me to lie to him ectect. so STUPIDLY, i listen to her, this is like an erin/emily scenario type thing (like getting on the 133 to get to liverpool st) as i should not listen to her when it comes to my mum and :guys(of her own age and mine), advice, and anything else for that matter. so anyway, i thought this was reasonable,.....reasoning....., not wanting to lie, and so i call him....
hello dad
hi
how are you
im good
aw but you still sound ill
yes, poor me
...blah...blah....blah(making small talk b4 springing the fact that in two days i'm giong to the otherside of the world!!)

so.....what are you ding this week...?
working
oh....cos...em.....wel...you see.....im ..em...giong to chinah.
   *bites nails...* this is the man that wants me to take self defence karate in an all girls group to avoid any contact/meeting with boys: who when i was up to the age of 13 told me/ tells me not to talk to strangers because they'll throw me in the dustbin: who won't let me stay over at my friends houses incase the dad/brother/anything that moves will rape me and even if i say that my friend lives alone with her mum, he still shouts that shes a lez.

don't say stupid things annabelle
em.....(begins to sweat) im not....i... really am going to china.
(long pause)****************
***** and then he puts me on hold,. !!

and then he calls me again....

hello......
(i can now hear cars and trucks driving past, whereas before he was clearly in his house)

BLAH..BLAH..BLAH...(too traumatised to remember O_O/:p )

**and then the dreaded words....
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER....
*** which means he's coming to my house.....nooooooooooooooo  :S,
its kinda scary but still kinda funni.......(annabelle says this while she pulls out random hairs and her eye twitches uncontrolably)"

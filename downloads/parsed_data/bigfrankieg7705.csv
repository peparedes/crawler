"event","So the seventh and final HP book came out last Saturday. It is called Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. and...........It was fucking amazing....hands down the best book of the series...it was like non-stopped action and soooo much shit happened and sooooooooo many people died and it was a very.....(carfully searching of a work).....emotional....especially the chapter that tells the fact that Severus Snape was in love with Lily and because of that has never hated Harry because he had his mothers eyes and the whole meaness thing was just an act."

"event","Alright...so thursday is the last day of classes and finals are next week and that is the most beautiful thing that i have heard in a while...i only have three finals and hopefully they are all on tuesday. i know that my math final and my theory final are are on tuesday and the scheduel says that my piano final is on friday and that aint workin for me...ima need to talk to mrs. morrison about that.....so....yeah... this weekend my sister is graduating with here masters degree...so i will be going to connecticut to see her...............

Delaware State University is the worst school that i have ever attended...because i had to go and ask about my refund in order for them to send it....mind you that i asked about it when there was three weeks left in school....they told me it would take seven buisiness days and about two and a half weeks later i went to see why it was taking sooooooo long and they told me it wouldnt be sent until may 5....that is complete and utter bull-shit if they could send my friends their refunds in a timely fashion than why does it take so encredibly long for mine to be sent......i dont understand.....i have had nothing but a bad experience with this university and i will be thrilled once this semester has ellapsed....

My car is still out of commission....i havent been able to drive my car for about three months and that pisses me off because i cant fix my car until my refund check comes....(see second paragraph)...so i have reached a new level of pisstivity...lol...but...my car should be up and running again by this time next week and i should be getting a job pretty soon so i wont have to worry about stupid schools and finals.....................except for the damn gas prices."

"event","i really only have one thing to say...and that is today i took a one hundred minuet nap and boy do i feel refreshed...but any way just an update, delaware state university still sucks and that is because it is unorganized and the music department sucks i have yet to have learned anything! i have decided to leave dsu at the end of the semester and just take classes at ud's continuing ed which is just the same classes that the ud students take. but i still have to get all of the information so my mother can look over it and say whether i actually can or not but if i cant i probably wont have a room to stay in next semester if i have to stay here. but hopefully that wont happen. keep your fingers crossed. you know what i am very annoyed by a certain person named marta i dont know why but she is truely pissing me off and maybe its because i heard that she is talking about me behind my back just like she talks about jenn and joesh to me she talks to them about me and apparently she was pissed at me all summer for reasons unknown to man...only god knows how that chicks mind works. because i knew u... and all that jazz. but i guess thats just life!

"event","So yesterday i was just walking up te stairs minding my buisiness and oops i trip up the fuckin stairs and i think that i may have broken my fuckin foot. so i sat through two fuckin classes then go to lunch and then i go the the health center where they tell me that they dont know what is wrong with my foot and if i wanted an x-ray then i would have to find transportation to the nearest place for an x-ray. so then they gave me a bag full of IB profin and ice packs and a pair of cruches and sent me on my way. so now im not using the curches because they hurt my arm pits. so in other news i we finally got a new chorus teacher here and he is a character. he is about 6'4"", white and jewish. is it me or does that not fit the description of a choral director at a HBC (historically black college) because i was confused. so yesterday was his first day and i dont really like him. the first thing he said is that he was promised a accomapianist for everyday class, and since he didnt have one there today he asked us if one of us could play for him. i was just sitting there like...why the fuck dont you get your oversized jew ass behind the mutha fuckin piano your self...its part of the fuckin job discription. but any way im dropping english as soon as i get money to. and that is abot all that i have to say for yesterday.

I truely cant wait to get the fuck out of this unorganized fuckin school and go somewhere where there's an excellent music program and the old friends the i know and love and there are alot more opertunities for me there like traveling across the world to places like russia, and italy, and paris and so many other places like that. it could be that i dont really talk to people around here but i havent really heard of any really good parties and i know that ud parties hard their slogan afterall is ""UD we pre-game better than you party"" and i have experienced that so i know that is true. the only thing that i can say is i cant wait to get the fuck out of here!"

"event","So last year around march. i still hadn't applied for college and i didn't know what to do. until one of my friends told me that there was still time to apply to Delaware State. and she told me that it was a really good school for music education too. but i've come to find out that she lied. because this school has one of the worst music departments that i have ever seen. for one we are now in the fourth fuckin week of school and they still havent found a fuckin replacement choral director, when they have had like three fuckin months to find one. lets just say that im a little pissed off. but i digress because hopefully next year i will be happily transfered in to the University of Delaware, where i can get a better education and be with my bestest friends."

Good times!

When I was criticized 
When I was ostracized 
When I was jassercized
Sticky kiddy pies 
When I was modernized 
When I was circumcised 
Daddy wasn't there to take me to the fair 
To change my underwear 
Daddy wasn't there 

Daddy wasn't there please

"event","ok so today was much better. we went to the cecil county fair, WOW! that was crazy... #1 it was basically all red necks(and they kept stareing at me like they aint never seen a black person before). #2 they had a bunch of cows and pigs and chickens (smelled horrible). #3 they were rafflin off fuckin tractors. WTF! i understand rafflin trucks and cars (they were doin that too) but a fuckin tractor...n e way...#4 they had a entire section for that cecil county funeral home in which they were sellin TOMBSTONES... Now i believe that Joesh said it best whin he said, ""who the fuck goes to a fair to buy a tombstone!?!?"" seriously though who does that? ""come on maw lets go and buy some tombstones at the county fair."" ""golly gee paw thats a splendid idea let me grab my purse!"" come one damit. 

well after we left the fair... we went to hoe's house so joesh could go get the ring and the phone that he bought her back...that went well...they didnt break up but he did take back the ring though...he said he's gonna wait for a while...to see if they actually stay together through his freshmen year of college...got my fingers crossed.

after that we went to Nick and Joe's to get some food and some Molly Molly Molly! she's awesome and i love her. she told me some good news about her and enrique, but im not at liberty to discuss said information. so we ate and we had a smoke with molly and we made her sing her like a prayer solo because she deserved it no matter what those dumb mutha fuckers thought but thats another subject completely (i hate that fuckin bitch). but thats alittle off the subject so then we said later to molly and...

...now we are at joeshes and were lookin for Scary Movie 3 on demand but its on a channel that joesh doesnt get...so instead we watched this other movie called ""thirteen"" (independent film) and it was very deep...i mean that shit was crazy. i give it two thumbs up. 

after the movie i took jenn home and her father was angry because she was about thirty minuets late...i mean common that shit aint that fuckin bad... and any way who gives their seventeen year old a fuckin curfew of fuckin 12:30 during the summer...that shit aint cool.

and now a song...

""Gonna find my baby,
gonna hold her tight,
gonna grab some afternoon delight.
my mottos always been when its right its right why wait until the middle of a cold dark night,
when every things alittle clearer in the light of day, 
and you know the night is always gonna be there anyway,
thinkin of her is workin up my appitite,
lookin forward to a little afternoon delight 
rubbin sticks and stones together makin sparks ignite,
and the thought of luvin you is getten so excitin.
sky rockets in flight (BOOOO)
afternoon delight (OOOOP)
afternoon delight.
'I think you have mental problems man.'
'yea you have mental problems man'
'yea'
'man'
afternoon delight""

stay classy san diego or a whales vagina

so last night after i vented on my lj i looked for the strongbad email animations and i found them and i watched a bunch of them including crying that is by far my favoriet one of all..... and i drew a picture of ""lil brudder it is so effing funny that i can barly contain my blatter when i watch it! go to homestarrunner.com it is the best. thats all folks

"event","so yesterday i went to acme for my first day of work and it turns out that i couldn't actually start working that day because i am leaving for college at the end of august. they said that there was no reason to train me just for me to leave in a four weeks. so the manager said that he'd think about giving me a job in the front of the store as a bagger/checker, and they said that they would call me and i havent heard any thing from them yet so.... i dont really think that i have a job....... and i am NOT going back to that construction job...... HELL NO!!!! 
on the lighter side of life i have recieved my schedule for school and there seems to be a tiny problem.... the chorus that i am supposed to take conflicts with one of my classes and i think that i need that class so i dont know if i can drop it or not. but i sure hope that i can. it shouldnt be a big problem.
so on saturday me jenn and joesh went to Avalon New Jersey with joesh's parents it was very fun... would have been more fun if i had written permission to drink... but i didnt and it was still fun to watch Joesh's parent and siblings get drunk... they are a hoot.... Greg (joesh's older brother) tryed to tell us the story of when he peed in his bed in barbados, but he had trouble telling it because his father and cousin kept interupting him so the five minuet story took about one hour to tell. 
i cant wait until next summer when we go to nebraska to see the guys though i believe that i will be seeing andrew before then, right jenn?

well thats all for today

THEN Joesh came and told them that he had SPIT on senorita vance's face... i was at home getting changed and doing number two, but thats a little off topic..... any way we met his mother at Brew Ha Ha and thats where he told the story. after hearing the story i felt that she totally deserved what she got however, ....... we all want him to walk @ graduation and there is a possibility that he wont because of that....... so i said as much of a bitch that she is that he should go and applogize to her......... though he felt that she would win if he applogized to her..... he doesnt have to mean it...... and now some background on his relationship with Nicole Vance well he's known her since he was young and she WAS his bestfriend and whatever and so he skipped her class afew times and she was angry about that and she had every right to be upset about that but she didnt have the right to cuss him out the way that she did repeatedly...... she knows where Joesh's buttons are and she just pushed them and pushed them and u know what happened but any way.... she would cuss him out and make him feel bad about him self..... and she would try to embarrass him infront of people..... and think it was cool..... so i fell that she is just some immature bitch that needs to just GROW THE FUCK UP AND LEARN TO BE A FUCKIN 26 YEAR OLD WOMAN AND STOP ACTIN LIKE A FUCKIN HIGH SCHOOL KID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! because if it was me i would have only said that i was done and if she kept pushin the fuckin buttons than i would have said exactly this... "" look i done told you that i dont want to associate with you and you done pushed the wrong buttons and i am not a violent person but some of my female family members are and trust me they dont like to see me upset about some bitch like you and they will handle it so you can keep talkin if u want because my mother, my sister, and my aunt jaquette can come here and handle this or you could just cut the crap and shut your fuckin mouth."" and you know what i dont like to make threats but some people just need to here that kind of stuff.

on a lighter note if you have on demand with comcast you should go to show time on demand and go to specials in the specials catagorie and watch ""Laugh Whore"" i sware that is the funniest shit that i have seen in a while. it makes fun of Micheal Jackson, Cher, Liza Manelli, and more i tell ya it is fuckin funny.

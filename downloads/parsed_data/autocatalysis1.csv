<P><EM><A href=""http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/oneday/index.html"">One Day in September</A></EM>, great movie. It's a documentary about the hostage crisis at the 1972 Munich Olympics, where eight Palestinian terrorists took&nbsp;several members of the Israeli team hostage. They sneaked into the Olympic Village&nbsp;at 4:40 am on Sept. 5 and&nbsp;took&nbsp;twelve Israeli athletes hostage, two of them shot to death in the process with one escaping. About 20 minutes later the terrorists' spokesman, holding a grenade,&nbsp;met with police outside the building where the hostages were being held&nbsp;and demanded the release of over 200 Palestinian prisoners. He gave a deadline of noon, at which&nbsp;time he said the hostages would be killed. Upon learning of the situation, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir made a statement saying these demands would not be met (the vast majority of the prisoners were being held in Israel). German officials personally offered the terrorists' spokesman ""an unlimited sum of money"" to release the hostages; this was turned down. Then one of them offered himself in exchange for the hostages, which was also refused. Meanwhile Olympics officials decided the games would continue.</P>
<P>As the noon deadline approached hostage negotiators pleaded for more time, falsely saying they were waiting for an answer from Israel on their demands. The deadline was extended until 5pm. At 2:15 a plan to ambush the terrorists by delivering food failed, when the spokesman himself carried the food into the building. At 3:50 the Olympics Committee finally suspended the games. As 5 o'clock approached 24 German police volunteers prepared to storm the building. But the plan was abandoned at the last minute,&nbsp;when it was realized the <STRONG>terrorists had a TV and were watching preparations for the attack live</STRONG>. After the deadline passed the terrorists altered their demands. They now wanted an airplane placed at their disposal so they could fly, along with the hostages, to a friendly Arab country. Hostage negotiators agreed, knowing they would never allow the terrorists to leave the airport. They made preparations to attack the terrorists as they made their way to waiting helicopters to take them to the airport. But when the terrorists' spokesman made a walk-through of the route to the helicopters <STRONG>he spotted police readying for the assault</STRONG> and demanded they be bussed instead of walking. So buses now transported the group from the building to the helicopters, which then flew them to the airport.</P>
<P>Meanwhile German police had made preparations for an ambush at the airport, with policemen dressed as a flight crew aboard the airplane and&nbsp;five snipers (<STRONG>none with special training</STRONG>)&nbsp;outside near where the helicopters were expected to land. Five snipers were chosen because it was assumed there were only five terrorists. But as the terrorists had exited the building back at the Olympic Village it was realized there were eight of them. But <STRONG>no changes were made to the assault plan and the snipers weren't told, none of them having radios (or&nbsp;protective gear,&nbsp;scopes or night vision devices)</STRONG>. As the helicopters were en route to the airport <STRONG>the police flight crew aboard the plane voted to abandon their&nbsp;mission and left</STRONG>. German police also forgot to move available armored cars from the Olympic Village out to the airport.</P>
<P>When the helicopters arrived at&nbsp;11:30 pm&nbsp;several terrorists got out to examine the airplane and found no one aboard. When they ran back to the helicopters the snipers opened fire, hitting only two of the terrorists.&nbsp;Twenty minutes later police finally called for the armored cars, which took another hour to arrive. About 12:30 am the <STRONG>German government announced that all the terrorists had been captured or killed and the hostages were safe</STRONG>. But this was an incomprehensible lie and&nbsp;fighting was continuing at the airport. More police finally drove onto the airfield and joined the fight, shooting one of their own snipers and a helicopter pilot. At 1 am with most of their comrades&nbsp;dead&nbsp;or wounded,&nbsp;two&nbsp;terrorists turned to the two&nbsp;helicopters holding the hostages, blowing one up with a grenade and spraying the other with bullets. <STRONG>All the hostages were killed.</STRONG> Three of the terrorists were captured alive.</P>
<P>The following month an airplane was hijacked and a demand was made for release of the three Palestinians by the German government. They quickly complied, without consulting Israel. It is speculated <STRONG>the hijacking was staged</STRONG>, with the German government eager to avoid future terrorist incidents by ridding themselves of the three prisoners. Israeli agents eventually killed two of the surviving hostage-takers, with <STRONG>one surviving to be&nbsp;interviewed for this documentary</STRONG>.</P>"

<P>Miranda and I just got out of <EM>Wedding Crashers</EM> at Cheap Flicks. Cute, but the whole thing lost some of&nbsp;its flavor for me when&nbsp;Vaughn and Wilson&nbsp;started falling for their respective targets. Nice cameo by Will Ferrell, and appreciate the brief flurry of tits towards the beginning. Also cool they worked in John McCain and James Carville. <EM>Domino</EM>, which we saw a few days ago, was unforgivably stupid.&nbsp;And bear in mind I'm saying this about a film starring Mickey Rourke and Keira Knightley's tits.</P>
<P>Gradually finding my balance in the ""office"" at the jewelry store. Just a matter of familiarizing myself with the routine, getting comfortable with the policies and paper shuffling. So much better than being on the sales floor. Fucking sales. And especially now with the mall being so empty and so few people even wandering into the store. I just don't have the knack for amoral bullshit that&nbsp;goes with convincing some&nbsp;twit she'll find fulfillment&nbsp;in an&nbsp;overpriced bit of shiny stone. That's not to say I'm not amoral. I just can't sell anything.</P>"

"event","<P>Parents dropped me off at my place about 9 last night. Immediately collapsed on the couch and struggled to stay awake while watching&nbsp;the rest of <EM>Inside Deep Throat</EM>. Good documentary but not enough clips of the film it was about. I've never seen <EM>Deep Throat</EM> and&nbsp;am&nbsp;disappointed to find that Netflix doesn't carry such an undisputed classic. Later on Miranda welcomed me home in the manner to which I've become accustomed. No deep throat, though.</P>

<P>Actually woke up early (!)&nbsp;yesterday morning, my last day in Lake Placid, to make a final survey of Main Street's shopping opportunities. Went right back to With Pipe and Book to have a last look around. Chose a couple of rum-flavored cigars from the humidor and retrieved the shop's other copy of <EM>Starling of the White House</EM> from the basement. When the woman behind the counter bagged my cigars she included a nifty box of matches with the store's name and address on it, and a picture of a pipe and book on the opposite side. Later I intentionally tucked them into a bag to be checked at the airport, not wanting them confiscated if I tried to take them aboard. I was to find when I got home that evening that minions of the Transportation Security Administration had randomly selected my bag for a search, and stolen&nbsp;the matches out of the cigar bag. In&nbsp;its place they thoughtfully left a letter explaining what they'd taken, along with two others in different pockets of&nbsp;the bag with more general statements regarding the search. Assholes.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y266/autocatalysis/WithPipeandBookLakePlacid.jpg""></P>
<P>Took a short walk up the street after leaving the bookstore, glancing around at all the other local shops in which I had no interest; many of them offering&nbsp;kitschy arts and crafts or antiques. Approaching the front of the hotel an elderly man in a parked car waved in my direction, and I guardedly returned the gesture not sure if he was waving at me. As I got closer I realized he <EM>was</EM> waving at me and must've been at the wedding reception the night before. He rolled down his window and thanked me for the book I'd given him, and I realized who he was. I mention this only to illustrate how little my brain cares to retain, even from as unusual an encounter as the one I'd had with this man the night before; like <EM>what he looked like</EM>. But my short term memory occasionally surprises me with a flash of retention, usually involving someone or something to do with breasts.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.lpresort.com/images/greatroom_front.jpg""></P>
<P>Eventually hit the road, nice scenery flying by, and I drifted in and out a bit as my early morning caught up with me. Flight at the airport was delayed a little and I alternately wandered around, read, and watched the football game on tv. The couple from our table the night before (the heteros)&nbsp;showed up for their flight at the gate next to ours and we chatted a little. Flight was uneventful, couldn't get any dvd's to play on my computer. The Detroit airport was depressing, everyone rushing around trying their best to&nbsp;look busy and important. People suck.&nbsp;On the drive back we stopped in Ann Arbor for a sidewalk dinner at this Greek place my parents had been to years ago with, coincidentally, my cousin whose wedding we'd just attended.</P>
<P>Read&nbsp;that night that a boat&nbsp;capsized on Lake George in New York, which we'd passed twice going to and from Albany, killing 20 elderly Michigan tourists while we were waiting for our flight.</P>"

"event","Just back from the wedding reception at some golf club nearby. Not one of the worst receptions I've been to. Can't emphasize enough how much the availability of alcohol improves one's opinion of an event.

Pat managed to get up today for an 8am breakfast, which I barely missed, sleeping until 3pm. Sweet, sweet sleep. Got up, took a shower, dressed and walked down the hill to Main St. to check out the used bookstore With Pipe and Book. Great little shop with an upstairs and a small basement. Lots of old maps and illustrations of the area and people. Also a humidor and an old large front counter which, at least in my famished state, transported me briefly to a kind of creaky 19th century general store. Ignoring hunger for the sake of book browsing led to a near collapse upstairs in the poly sci section, as I stood up after examining a low shelf.

Too quickly the family arrived outside and Pat came in to drag me out. I stowed the two books I'd already picked out, 'A Sense of the Senate' by Seymour K. Freidin and 'Roll Call: One Year in the United States Senate' by William S. Cohen, intending to come back for them later. Got to the golf club, dropped Mom and Dad off and then Pat and I turned right around and went back to Main St. Finally got some food at a nice little Italian place, where the young people running it were actually speaking Italian to each other. Then back to With Pipe and Book, which kicked us out at 5:30 when they closed. I bought the two books I'd already picked out plus another copy of 'Starling of the White House', a fantastic memoir of a Secret Service agent's time spent serving five presidents beginning with Wilson. Thought I might give it as a gift.

Having deliberately skipped the ceremony (fuck weddings) and official picture-taking, we arrived to everyone standing around drinking and sampling hors d'oeuvres from circulating waiters. The view from the rear deck where we were was unspeakably gorgeous, with nearly 180 degrees of the Adirondacks. My father introduced me to Dolph Bridgewater who was Assistant Director for National Security and International Affairs of the OMB under Nixon. For whatever reason we started talking about the Secret Service and its responsibilities, in terms of presidential protection and discretion. At some point I decided to give him 'Starling of the White House', which I was still carrying and had shown him. We all went inside for dinner and chose a table to sit at, there thankfully being no assigned seating. With us were a local lesbian couple (tragically not of the lipstick variety) and a well-to-do couple from Maryland, the Beatys. John Beaty had worked in some capacity for Robert McNamara when he was Secretary of Defense, and monopolized the conversation with political anecdotes and tales of personal travel. Interesting guy, but after a few minutes of being ignored his wife developed a permanent expression of annoyance. So after the dykes left I moved over a couple seats to try to engage her. She immediately brightened up and we talked about her former career as a lawyer, and I asked her about traveling in Morocco which she assured me I would love.

Dancing, drinking, mingling, drinking. Exchanged meaningful glances and short humorous remarks with our waitress throughout the evening, but she took off before I had an opportunity to express my true feelings for her. Didn't dance, but rather filled that time with extra drinking. People are such fools at weddings. One of the photographers was cute; both actually. We got on well but she was rather occupied with taking pictures or some nonsense. It was good to see my cousin Heidi, who teaches at the University of Hawaii but is in Colorado now pursuing graduate work in Buddhism. Also her Taiwanese husband, whose name I won't disparage by trying to spell.

Pat had earlier hitched a ride back to the hotel, and I decided to return with my parents after I'd convinced myself that the remaining wait staff were probably too young to try goading into including me in any after-work plans they might have. Plus at least half of everybody had already departed, along with most of the interesting people. And there really weren't any peers of mine in attendance all night. At least none that presented themselves as potentially engaging conversationalists. Experienced some relief there weren't any real hotties there, this being a family reunion of sorts (but not the one in Kentucky). Wish I had more time to explore the area, but I guess I fulfilled my immediate requirements for entertainment with book shopping and drinking. May get up a little early tomorrow to have a final look around Main St.

"event","Here for the first time in NY, for my cousin's wedding. Flew out of Detroit this morning at 10-something, my brother and me and our parents. Which meant leaving B.C. about 7:30. Which, because I went out last night to Ouzos, meant only three hours of sleep. Lounging now in my room at the Crowne Plaza Resort, there's a ball game on tv, and my brother's already in his bed. Got back a little while ago from the rehearsal dinner at the groom's parents' place. Wasn't too painful.

On the drive out to Detroit I tried to sleep a little, and then on the plane with my head on the fold-out tray. Couldn't recline the seat at all because we were in the last row and there was a wall immediately behind us. Also a window shade, but no window. Was conscious enough during the flight to catch bits of conversation between my father across the aisle and his seatmate, an Egyptian student; and also between him and our Egyptian flight attendant who was seated at the end of the aisle just behind us. She was wearing a pendant which read in Arabic something like, ""God is the ultimate protector."" So, yikes.

Took just a little over an hour to get to Albany. Then another two-hour car ride in a rental to Lake Placid. Checked into our hotel, then down to Main St. for some book shopping (and shoe shopping for Pat). Also hit a Gap outlet for some pants. Great little strip of shops along the water, surrounded by large rolling forested hills, very pretty. Two bookshops, one of which was open. But actually purchased from the small library down the street, four for just a dollar (the librarian gave me 70% off -- if she wasn't like 50, it so would've been on). Got Mark Twain's 'The Innocents Abroad', Bertrand Russell's 'Mysticism and Logic', a survey of French structuralists called 'Structuralism and Since', and Geraldine Ferraro's memoir for Miranda. As lovely as the town is I wouldn't be enjoying myself half as much if there wasn't a bookstore. It's not just a shopping option, it truly says something about any modestly-sized town that it have at least one bookstore (even if it's part of a chain). And this one has two local bookshops side-by-side.

Got back to the hotel and quickly changed for the rehearsal dinner. Decent food, booze, and four or five people worth talking to made the event endurable. Talked to my cousin Warner about New School University, where I hope to attend classes and he already has. Spoke to Uncle Edison about his co-chairmanship of the UN Affairs Coordinating Committee, and the stale architecture of the headquarters building. Talked to several people about books, aviation and my pathetic collegiate progress; a former chemical engineer about the recent storms in the Gulf of Mexico, and presidential biographies; and cousins Matt and Dorian about the suggestively posed nude Olympian statue outside the Great Room back at the hotel. Briefly hit the bar on returning, then up to the room, and soon to sleep.

"event","<P>Was&nbsp;at the Lansing Mall for a couple days of classes related to my new job. Just got back tonight. Decided to stay at a hotel for the duration when I&nbsp;realized I'd have to be there at&nbsp;10&nbsp;when the mall opened.&nbsp;Reveals something&nbsp;of my priorities, that I paid at least as much for a hotel room as what I earned for being there in the first place. All that for an extra 45 minutes of sleep each morning. Even then I was late my first day.</P>
<P>Tuesday after some trouble I eventually found the only two used bookshops I was to visit. But by the time I arrived they were both closed. Today the class finished a little early and I drove&nbsp;to Curious Book Shop next to campus. Didn't leave with anything; couldn't quite talk myself into a thick history of Norway. Then to Archives Book Shop down the street, where I had just enough time before close to discover a couple of postcards of&nbsp;Frogner Park in Oslo.&nbsp;Don't know why exactly I was drawn to things Norwegian at each stop.

<P>Vindicated in <A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/autocatalysis1/2298.html"">my dismissal of Updike</A> by Gore Vidal! From <EM>Views from a Window: Conversations with Gore Vidal</EM>:</P>
<P>Paris Review, 1974:&nbsp;&nbsp; How about some of the younger writers? What do you think of John Updike, for example?</P>
<P>Vidal:&nbsp;&nbsp; He writes so well that I wish he could attract my interest. I like his prose and disagree with Mailer who thinks it bad. Mailer said it was the kind of bad writing that people who don't know much about writing think is good. It is an observation that I understand, but I don't think it applies to Updike. With me the problem is that he doesn't write about anything that interests me. I am not concerned with middle-class suburban couples. On the other hand, I'm not concerned with adultery in the French provinces either. Yet Flaubert commands my attention. I don't know why Updike doesn't. Perhaps my fault. [<EM>moi</EM>: I didn't love <EM>Madame Bovary</EM> but I read it years before suffering through <EM>Rabbit, Run</EM> and many years before discarding <EM>Toward the End of Time</EM>, and found it much easier and more enjoyable.]</P>
<P>Daniel Halpern, 1969:&nbsp;&nbsp; To go back for a moment to style and content, you, then, make the distinction with John Updike between what he says and how he says it. You enjoy his prose but lose interest in what he is saying.</P>
<P>Vidal:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, but I would say that with my interest in language, in style, I can certainly read him with a degree of pleasure if not profit, whereas somebody whose subject matter theoretically is a good deal more interesting, like Bill Burroughs, I can hardly read at all because of that cretinous style he's put together.</P>"

<P>A few&nbsp;choice excerpts from Evan Wright's <EM>Generation Kill</EM>, his record of&nbsp;the battles of a&nbsp;platoon of Reconnaissance Marines as they&nbsp;moved north into Iraq as the front line soldiers of the March 2003 invasion:</P>
<UL>
<LI>""Who's the fucking retard who sent us into that town?"" Person asks, spitting a thick stream of tobacco juice, which catches in the wind and mists across the faces of several of his buddies standing nearby. ""That sure tops my list of stupid shit we've done."" Trombley is beside himself. ""I was just thinking one thing when we drove into that ambush,"" he enthuses. ""Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. I felt like I was living it when I seen the flames coming out of windows, the blown-up car in the street, guys crawling around shooting at us. It was fucking cool.""</LI>
<LI>The Hispanics in the platoon refer to the white guys as ""cracker-ass fucks,"" the whites refer to them as ""muds"" and to Spanish as ""dirty spic talk,"" and they are the best of friends.</LI>
<LI>""Hey, it's ten in the morning!"" says Person, yelling at two farmers dressed in robes in the distance. ""Don't you think you ought to change out of your pajamas?""</LI>
<LI>Before First Recon's campaign is over, Captain America will lose control of his platoon when he is temporarily relieved of command. Already, some of his men are beginning to fantasize about his death. ""All it takes is one dumb guy in charge to ruin everything,"" says one of them. ""Every time he steps out of the vehicle, I pray he gets shot.""</LI>
<LI>A teenage boy and girl walk ahead on the trail, holding hands. ""Kind of cute,"" Colbert observes. ""Don't shoot them, Garza,"" he adds. As they roll past the hand-holding teens, Colbert and Person wave at them and start singing the South Park version of ""Loving You,"" with the lyrics ""Loving you is easy 'cause you're bare-chested.""</LI>
<LI>""It should be a little acid,"" Person says, offering his own medical opinion. ""And burn a little when it comes out."" ""Maybe on your little bitch asshole from all the cock that's been stuffed up it,"" Colbert snaps. Hearing this exchange, another Marine in the platoon says, ""Man, the Marines are so homoerotic. That's all we talk about. Have you guys ever realized how homoerotic this whole thing is?"" Just before sundown, Marine artillery batteries, dug in a few kilometers ahead, begin to pound the city. As darkness falls, Colbert's team excavates Ranger graves by the Humvee. The ground trembles as a column of massive M1A1 tanks rolls past, a few feet from where the Marines are resting. Out of the darkness, someone shouts, ""Hey, if you lay down with your cock on the ground, it feels good.""</LI>
<LI>""They shot one of my Marines in the stomach out there."" He gestures toward the field. ""We fired back. Blew a donkey's head off. We didn't see nothing else.""</LI>
<LI>The only action they saw occurred on the night their perimeter was overrun by camels. Espera and his men opened up on them with machine guns. ""After three weeks out there, no sleep, living in those holes, I was fucking hallucinating,"" he explains. ""We thought those camels were fucking Hajjis coming over the wire. When we lit those motherfuckers up, it was fucking raining camel meat. It was a mess, dog. Motherfuckers even did a story on it in the <EM>L.A. Times</EM>.""</LI>
<LI>""Yeah,"" Person says, a note of belligerence in his voice. ""When I get back I'm gonna start a gay club. I'll call it the Men's Room. There will be, like, a big urinal with a two-way mirror everyone pisses against. It will be, like, facing the bar, so when everyone's drinking there will be, like, these big cocks pissing at them.""</LI>
<LI>""Oh, my God!"" Person laughs. ""He's got his bayonet out."" Captain America runs across the field ahead of his Humvee, bayonet fixed on his M-16, ready to savage enemy forces. He turns every few paces and dramatically waves his men forward, like an action hero. ""He thinks he's Rambo,"" Person guffaws. ""That retard is in charge of people?""</LI>
<LI>Traveling the world as a Marine has opened his eyes to stark differences between the way Americans and those in less fortunate parts of the planet live. ""All these countries around the world, nobody's fat,"" he says. ""Back home, fat motherfuckers are everywhere. Seventy-five percent of all Americans are fat. Do you know how hard it is to put on thirty pounds? A motherfucker has to sit on the couch and do nothing but eat all day. In America, white trash and poor Mexicans are all fat as motherfuckers. The white man created a system with so much excess, even the poor motherfuckers are fat.""</LI></UL>"

<P>Miranda's been extra nice to me the last couple days as it's become clear she infected me with some kind of bronchitis-like awfulness.&nbsp;Thank Christ I've got a couple days off to suffer through what I hope is the worst of it.</P>
<P>Went through a rough patch recently as I was&nbsp;reading&nbsp;Jimmy Carter's memoir and also listening to Madeleine Albright's. There was an extended stretch where they were both recounting their involvement in peacemaking efforts regarding the Israeli-Palestinian clusterfuck, and I nearly had to kill myself. I can't tell you how sick I am of hearing about that hopeless fucking religious real estate dispute. I wonder if I screamed loudly enough that&nbsp;my deity promised my people the greater part of some beachfront property on the Mediterranean&nbsp;I would be taken seriously.</P>

<P>Got a good movie from Netflix the other day, the PBS Frontline documentary <EM>Ghosts of Rwanda</EM>, about the 1994 genocide. During 100 days of state-sponsored ethnic slaughter over 800,000 people were massacred while&nbsp;the UN&nbsp;and&nbsp;foreign nations&nbsp;did virtually nothing. The death toll on 9/11 and subsequent response&nbsp;offers some perspective. We lost 3,000 in one day and retaliated by going to war against Afghanistan and then, for good measure, Iraq. The Rwandans lost an average of 8,000 per day for 100 days and the UN responded by pulling out most of its troops, along with thousands of caucasians, and the remaining&nbsp;handful of soldiers&nbsp;were told not to intervene. (This was just after the&nbsp;<EM>Black Hawk Down</EM>&nbsp;nonsense in Somalia.) The Canadian general in charge of the UN peacekeeping mission, Romeo Dallaire, published a book about his experience called <EM>Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda</EM>, which I've not read. But I can recommend an excellent&nbsp;book about acts of&nbsp;20th century genocide and&nbsp;America's responses to them, including Rwanda,&nbsp;called <EM>""A Problem from Hell"": America and the Age of Genocide</EM>,&nbsp;by Samantha Power; for which she won a Pulitzer.</P>"

"event","<P>Spent a nice couple days in and around Youngstown, Ohio this past weekend. We were meeting up with one of Dad's sisters and her husband, Sally and Edison, and my brother Pat and I came along. Dad grew up in Youngstown and usually goes back at least once or twice a year. We stayed at the Inn at the Green, a nice 19th century&nbsp;bed &amp; breakfast&nbsp;I've stayed at once before. They have a nice bookcase of well chosen volumes I spent time browsing through, and a very pleasant reading room in which to lounge and enjoy them. Also a decanter of some kind of&nbsp;liquor was available round the clock.</P>

<P>Sunday, the&nbsp;first night, we attended a small dinner party at some relation's nicely appointed home.&nbsp;A rare clean break with my father regarding the artwork on display; I liked it, he hated it. There was a black guy there, which momentarily confused me until I realized he was serving drinks. There were I think nine of us, but the hostess's brother had apparently been asked not to join us for dinner and generally stay out of our way; he helped cook and serve the meal. The next day we met up at the&nbsp;fantastic library down the street from the b&amp;b and had lunch at the cafe there, and I browsed the basement bookstore. Found three books in short order: <EM>Views from a Window: Conversations with Gore Vidal</EM>; <EM>Woodrow Wilson's Own Story</EM>; and <EM>Burke, Disraeli and Churchill: The Politics of Perseverance</EM>.</P>

<P>Drove around&nbsp;Youngstown, got lost, toured the&nbsp;wonderful&nbsp;Mill Creek Park where Dad used to play when he was young. Went by his grandfather's house and saw the low stone wall he built. Then onto Dad's childhood home, which unfortunately has fallen into some disrepair.</P>

<P>Then dinner at this awful local&nbsp;country restaurant,&nbsp;near an antiques shop where a few years ago Mom and Dad met Martin Sheen.&nbsp;Got back to the b&amp;b and then went out again with Dad to a couple bookstores we'd passed on the way back. He bought me a biography of Marcus Aurelius, a book I'd been searching for for quite a while. Said goodbye to Aunt Sally and Uncle Edison that night, as they&nbsp;would be&nbsp;off to Maryland early the next morning and I am not a morning person. All the same we had to be up&nbsp;and checked out by 11. Had brunch at the library cafe&nbsp;again and again I left the used bookstore with something, this time Thomas L. Friedman's <EM>Longitudes and Attitudes: The World in the Age of Terrorism</EM>. On the way home we hit an outlet mall&nbsp;in Fremont,&nbsp;Indiana, and then had&nbsp;dinner at a&nbsp;charming but sadly empty restaurant down the road called the Herb Garden.</P>"

<P><IMG src=""http://www.ikea.com/PIAimages/36217_PE127292_S3.jpg""></P>
<P>Recently finished <EM>Chances of a Lifetime: A Memoir</EM> by Warren Christopher, Clinton's first secretary of state. It was okay, didn't knock me down. His description of his trip to Taiwan in late 1978 is eye-opening. At the time he was Carter's deputy secretary of state and traveling to Taiwan to ""put the best face on U.S. termination of official relations and removal of its official representatives from the island"" as part of normalizing relations with mainland China. Having arrived at Taipei airport, he writes: ""As I moved toward the embassy car with U.S. ambassador Leonard Unger for the drive to my hotel, I wondered how the Taiwanese government planned to top what must surely have been one of the most hostile official welcomes ever extended to a visiting official. The answer came sooner than I'd anticipated. Outside the airport grounds our car turned onto a road lined with an angry, jeering mob of about twenty thousand people. As we moved through the middle of the crowd, eggs and ripe tomatoes began to fly at us from both sides of the road. Following these relatively benign missiles came cans and rocks encased in mud. Within three or four minutes, every window in the car was shattered, Leonard Unger's glasses were broken, and we were both nursing cuts from flying glass.</P>
<P>""As the car inched down the road, the protesters moved in and surrounded us. Some held bamboo poles that they jammed through the car's broken windows, forcing Unger and me to perform a panicked limbo dance in the backseat. Next, demonstrators jumped on the bumpers and fenders, violently rocking the vehicle, while hands grabbed at us through the windows, attempting to pull us into the mob. We looked around for help, but none was to be had. The Taiwanese police in the vicinity did nothing more than stand quietly, staring impassively at us and the surrounding chaos."" Nixon had a similar experience in Venezuela in 1958 when he was Eisenhower's vice president. It's&nbsp;almost impossible&nbsp;to imagine something like that happening today, with all the security and stage management that goes into official trips.</P>
<P>Also Maureen Dowd's compilation of Bush related NYT's columns, <EM>Bushworld: Enter At Your Own Risk</EM>. Entertaining but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a Dowd fan. There's a lot of repetition of themes from column to column, phrased slightly differently each time. The&nbsp;single passage that stayed with me was from a November 6, 2002 column entitled ""Under the Ramadan Moon"": ""The tragedy that shook this country, and spurred ordinarily tame Saudi papers to run blaring headlines criticizing the government, was the fire last March in the Mecca girls' school. Started by a teenager's tossed cigarette butt, the fire killed fifteen girls after the <EM>mutawwa</EM>, the religious police, stopped rescue workers from saving students trying to escape without scarves and <EM>abayas</EM>."" I thought I remembered having heard about it at the time but I wasn't sure if I was confusing&nbsp;the memory&nbsp;with an episode of <EM>The West Wing</EM>. That kind of&nbsp;religious horror&nbsp;is enough to make you want to write off an entire nation.</P>

"event","Monday we got up early (before noon) so we could check out (by noon).
I stayed up late the night before browsing online and finding directions
to a couple bookstores we could hit on our way out of town. I got the
least sleep but it was Miranda who was dragging for most of the
following day. The first bookstore was unimpressive, a
bland and bare discount shop near our hotel. But I did pick up a copy
of the modestly titled <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Democracy, the Internet, and the Overthrow of Everything</span>
by Joe Trippi, Howard Dean's campaign manager. Actually, like
everything that day, Miranda picked it up because I was virtually
broke. Then we went downtown to find a shop called Sur La Table so I
could grab some things for my mother. Miranda stayed in the car in case
a cop stopped to inquire why we'd parked in a loading zone.<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://www.msichicago.org/info/hyde/img/bookstore.jpg""><br>
<br>
Next was a bookshop I was especially eager to visit, O'Gara &amp;
Wilson, opened in 1937 it's Chicago's oldest. It was near a college
campus and small and not particularly distinguished, but still a treat
to browse. I found a book with no jacket published in 1960 called <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A History of Orgies</span> by Burgo Partridge. How it happened that this book was on the shelf long enough for me to find it mystifies me. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Who passes on a book called </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">A History of Orgies</span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">?</span>
And for $4.50? When we left I had Miranda take a picture of me in front
of Chicago's oldest bookstore, for which she called me a dork. Across
the street was another Powell's. Miranda was now sick of books so I
tried to hurry my examination of the shelves. Didn't
buy anything there, but did think hard about a biography of Caligula
before deciding it wasn't readable enough. (If that crazy
motherfucker's the subject of your book and you can't make it engaging
to read, you fucked up.)<br>
<br>
Headed out of town and towards home. Awful traffic, pulled off the
highway after a while and found food at a mall. I ate and Miranda sat
looking miserable; didn't eat, didn't want to shop, didn't want to
visit the carnival set up in the parking lot. Later we made our last
stop before getting home, at an awful outlet mall in Indiana. At a
bookstore selling mostly full-priced books I got a copy of Christopher Buckley's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Washington Schlepped Here: Walking in the Nation's Capital</span>.
Otherwise, great shops with overpriced and unattractive inventories. It
was several miles off the highway and had the look of a brand new ghost
town. Besides the employees there were only a handful of people
wandering around. A giant oddly shaped smokestack intimidating the
skyline completed the impression of a kind of dazed, post-apocalyptic
dystopia. You think I exaggerate, visit Lighthouse Place Premium
Outlets on any Monday evening.<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span><br>"

"event","<P>Miranda's continuing efforts to bankrupt me have culminated this weekend in a nearly triumphant trip to Chicago, from whence&nbsp;I am penning this missive. We got in on Friday night and drove around downtown for about two hours looking for a hotel. Yea I know, book before you leave. Get fucked. The only one we saw, a Holiday Inn Express, didn't have any non-smoking rooms left. Well we saw another one, too, but given the look of the people milling around out front, I was sure if we popped in there I'd just waste what money I have left on dirty pussy and cheap crack, which seemed to be on offer in plenty. We ended up about 10 miles west of town at <EM>another</EM> Holiday Inn. So already our plans to drop some coin on a nice room in a swank hotel downtown were queered.</P>
<P>Miranda's done sewing the conveniently&nbsp;torn&nbsp;hole&nbsp;in the front of&nbsp;her denim skirt, so I guess we can leave our room now. More later, we're off to IHOP and Powell's.</P>"

<P>I've just erased two paragraphs I penned on the subject. I know some about&nbsp;the case, Congress's intervention and the awful media coverage,&nbsp;but not enough I think to accurately vent my anger. It's one of those mundane&nbsp;news topics, like the current Jackson trial, that I hate principally because of the saturation coverage inflicted on it and consequently me. But unlike MJ's legal woes, the Schiavo case&nbsp;is justified in receiving the attention it has, but that which it has received&nbsp;seems to be grossly and irresponsibly misplaced. While knowing better, I hope this crazed religious-political intervention in a private citizen's medical affairs is turned inside out and upside down by&nbsp;responsible media and government officials over the next several months.</P>

"event","<P>Last night finished the first volume of Rousseau's <EM>Confessions</EM>.&nbsp;It's a really nice hardcover Everyman's Library edition I picked up at the Kazoo Barnes &amp; Noble off the clearance table for a freaking dollar. It covers his less interesting&nbsp;early years from his birth in&nbsp;1712&nbsp;in Geneva, until 1749 just before his revelation on the road to Vincennes, walking to visit an imprisoned Diderot. I'm moving straight on to the second volume&nbsp;and I'm hoping for so much more from it, the bulk of his public and literary life, a record of more monumental events.&nbsp;I'm concerned I might not go back to it if I don't&nbsp;go right&nbsp;to the more interesting stuff now, given the (I hope) comparative mediocrity of the first part.&nbsp;I'm encouraged at&nbsp;Rousseau's comment at the beginning of volume two, in reference to&nbsp;his revelation:&nbsp;""[Diderot] encouraged me to allow my ideas to have full play, and to compete for the [essay]&nbsp;prize. I did so, and from that moment I was lost.&nbsp;The misfortunes of the remainder of my life were the inevitable result of this moment of madness.""</P>
<P>It's not that I&nbsp;haven't enjoyed what I've read so far, but if I may make two minor editorial comments... He doesn't take pains to flesh out his environment for the reader, allowing him to grasp either&nbsp;the author's&nbsp;concrete surroundings or the contemporary political and historical goings on. When it's mentioned&nbsp;it's more in passing. But I'm sure Rousseau's response would be that his aim in this work is to relate his inner environment, not to provide a comprehensive memoir for the historically ignorant. The other criticism is simply that it needs an editor. Among other things he seems to need to mention everyone with whom he ever came into contact, rather than just those who directly influenced him.</P>
<P>An excerpt from the end of Book IV which I liked a lot:</P>
<P>""These lengthy details of my early youth will naturally have seemed puerile, and I regret it; although born a man in certain respects, I long remained a child, and in many respects I am one still. I have never promised to introduce a great character to the public; I have promised to describe myself as I am; and, in order to know me in my riper years, it is necessary to have known me well in my youth. Since, as a rule, objects make less impression upon me than the remembrance of them, and since all my ideas assume the form of the representations of objects in my mind, the first traits which have stamped themselves upon my mind have remained, and those which have since imprinted themselves there have rather combined with them than obliterated them. There is a certain sequence of mental conditions and ideas, which exercises an influence upon those which follow them, with which it is necessary to be acquainted, in order to pass a correct judgment upon the latter. I endeavour in all cases to develop the first causes, in order to make the concatenation of effects felt. I should like to be able to make my soul to a certain extent transparent to the eyes of the reader; and, with this object, I endeavour to show it to him from all points of view, to exhibit it to him in every aspect, and to contrive that none of its movements shall escape his notice, so that he may be able by himself to judge of the principles that produce them.""</P>
<P>A cautionary excerpt for the SoBC group: ""As we lived at a great distance from one another, we all three met once a week at the Palais-Royal, and dined together at the Hotel du Panier Fleuri. These little weekly dinners must have been exceedingly agreeable to Diderot, for he, who nearly always failed to keep his other appointments, never missed one of them. On these occasions I drew up the plan of a periodical, to be called <EM>Le Persifleur</EM>, to be written by Diderot and myself alternately. I sketched the outlines of the first number, and in this manner became acquainted with D'Alembert, to whom Diderot had spoken of it. However, unforeseen events stopped the way, and the project fell into abeyance.""</P>

"event","<P>[sigh] After months of slowly and deliberately savoring it, I finally finished it Monday night. <EM>""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" Presents: America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction</EM> is just as good as the brilliant show that spawned it. A random sampling of excerpts:</P>
<P>About the Enlightenment: ""Hey, what if we stop storing the corpses in the drinking water and see if that makes any difference to our health?"" |&nbsp;From Rob Corddry's page&nbsp;on Founding Mothers:&nbsp;""Finally, there's Sybil Ludington, who at 16 years old rode 40 miles around the town of Fredericksburg, New York, to alert local militia the British were coming. She's often called 'The Female Paul Revere.' Although really, she rode twice as far as Paul Revere, so maybe he should be called 'The Male Sybil Ludington!' Just kidding, that would be gay. I found this story by accident during my routine Google search for '16-year-olds + horses.'""</P>
<P>On the presidency: ""Why no women, blacks, or non-Christians have answered the Founders' challenge is a mystery, though most indications point to some inherent genetic flaw."" |&nbsp;""Though the president is never actually required to salute anybody, President George W. Bush does it regularly because it's one of the things he doesn't know."" |&nbsp;On page 99 are all nine Supreme Court Justices, naked. Which is apparently why Wal-Mart won't stock the book. Anyone shocked Wal-Mart found a reason not to stock a book? Anyone? | Ayn Rand says about the book,&nbsp;""This is similar to my works in that anyone who reads it is sure to be an asshole for at least a month afterward.""</P>
<P>Guess who's got tickets to see Jon Stewart in Detroit on April 2nd. Huh? What's that? That's right, bitches. Moi.</P>

It's so dated and every character is a stereotype, and the writing and acting is&nbsp;embarrassingly self-conscious. But somehow she's enjoying it, so I'm passing the time by recording my pain and drinking.</P>

<P>Finished reading Clark Clifford's excellent memoir, <EM>Counsel to the President</EM>. I'd read him mentioned in other books before, but I think my specific interest in him came from his portrayal by Donald Sutherland&nbsp;in the terrific HBO movie about LBJ and Vietnam, <EM>Path to War</EM>. He ""had a hand in the launching of the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the birth of the present national security system and other seminal events in the post-WW II era. He served as President Kennedy's personal lawyer, was Lyndon Johnson's closest adviser during the Vietnam War and succeeded Robert McNamara as Secretary of Defense."" (Publishers Weekly)</P>

I find I get a lot more reading done, and whenever I need access I can just go to Miranda's. Thanks, Miranda. I fought Pat when he wanted to sign up initially and I'm glad now that it's gone. I just&nbsp;spend so much time online and watching movies, the more ways I can find to streamline my screen time the better.</P>
<P>Happy 25th, Andy! Hope you enjoyed yourself. And balls to Heather for not coming out. We'll have to devise some sort of punishment at the next Sage meeting. I suggest&nbsp;a public paddling (or saddling), to be photographed and subsequently displayed at a fundraiser for our rag. EPC can play and you and I can pen amusing napkin phrases or some shit. Then we can split the proceeds, close the Sage and hightail it the fuck out of here.</P>"

"event","<P>I feel, as I frequently do, that I may be dying. I've contracted something between a hangover and the flu, with insomnia. Miranda came over before class today&nbsp;at 5pm&nbsp;and made me a spaghetti breakfast (breakfast for me, something like lunch for her), which was very nice.</P>
<P>Saw <A href=""http://www.stephenlynch.com/"">Stephen Lynch</A> and Mitch Hedberg at the State Theatre in Kalamazoo last Thursday with Miranda. Mitch was not quite on his game but Stephen, a WMU alumnus, was hilarious and received a standing ovation. And the two filler acts were also quite good.</P>
<P>The wheels are turning on&nbsp;the satirical periodical<EM>&nbsp;Sage of Battle Creek</EM>. We'll see if this buggy gets anywhere.

<P>Just finishing up my first book by William F. Buckley, Jr., <EM>A Hymnal: The Controversial Arts</EM>, a curiously titled collection of&nbsp;the conservative intellectual's&nbsp;writings from around the years 1975-78. I admire Buckley not so much for his politics as for his intelligence, wit, mastery of the language, and justifiable arrogance. I'm always impressed by a man, regardless of his political affiliation,&nbsp;who can argue&nbsp;a case so convincingly&nbsp;that one is forced to pause and if not reexamine one's position, at least allow for the possibility that what was previously black as pitch&nbsp;is now disconcertingly gray. Christopher Hitchens is another of that rare breed. Buckley hosted an interview&nbsp;program on PBS called <EM>Firing Line</EM> for something like 30 years, which I never had the privilege of seeing. Recently he staged a mock <EM>Firing Line</EM> interview with his son Christopher Buckley, one of whose books I have but, like so&nbsp;many countless others,&nbsp;haven't gotten to yet. C-SPAN has&nbsp;the interview&nbsp;archived (at least temporarily) <A href=""rtsp://video.c-span.org/60days/ap122504.rm"">here</A>. (You may have to cut-and-paste the link directly to RealPlayer.)

"event","<P>Alright, fuck Updike. I tried and I tried but he's just so <EM>boring</EM>. He clearly has an excellent command of the language, and I can appreciate that. But that makes for a good editor, not an author. I acknowledge that my conclusion is based only&nbsp;on <EM>Rabbit, Run</EM> (read years ago) and the first third of <EM>Toward the End of Time</EM>, but I submit that that must be&nbsp;enough. The audience's patience can only be tried for so long.</P>
<P>So in an attempt to get my rhythm back&nbsp;I quickly devoured Bill Murray's <EM>Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf</EM>. And it was awful too. But here's the difference. I finished Murray's book. I got it because I love Bill Murray, not golf. Never played a single game. But even the parts that weren't about golf were pretty dull. So even if you're a big Bill Murray fan, only if you're a passionate&nbsp;golfer should you contemplate reading this one. And Bill should stick to acting.</P>

"event","Reading John Updike's 'Toward the End of Time', my first fiction in months (if you don't count 'Ghostbusters: The Return', and I don't, it was awful; but it's Ghostbusters so it doesn't matter). Had to read 'Rabbit, Run' for Literary Classics at WMU a few years ago, and didn't care for it at all. The professor had a hard-on for Updike. I'm liking this one a little more, but I'm having the uneasy feeling in the first few pages that he started the book not knowing what he wanted to do with it. I've heard Stephen King writes that way, without knowing where he's going until he's in the middle. I don't care for King or that method, at least when it's apparent to the reader. Anyway, speaks well of Updike's reputation that I'm giving him a second chance.

I'm giving comics another go. Don't think I've read any for about a decade. But then with the 20th anniversary of 'Ghostbusters' last year a new comic series started (thank you, 88 MPH Studios!). So browsing Discount Hobby I came across 'Transformers: War Within: The Age of Wrath'. I know, sweet right? And then today I got an issue of 'The Red Star', this sort of futuristic-dystopic-Red Army-looking item."

How many Bush administration officials does it take to change a lightbulb?
None. There's nothing wrong with that lightbulb. There is no need to change anything. We made the right decision and nothing has happened to change our minds. People who criticize this lightbulb now, just because it doesn't work anymore, supported us when we first screwed it in, and when these flip-floppers insist on saying that it is burned out, they are merely giving aid and encouragement to the Forces of Darkness."

Seller was a pleasant woman, works for Hospice. Came home and watched Chris Rock's HBO special, 'Never Scared', until I fell asleep. Stopped by the Brookstone office and picked up a packet of forms to fill out for lease renewal. Nice picture on the front page of the NYT of crowds massing outside parliament in Kiev to protest presidential election results. The margin of victory for the proclaimed winner is comparable to Bush's on the 2nd. Would be nice to see some of that enraged enthusiasm on display over here."

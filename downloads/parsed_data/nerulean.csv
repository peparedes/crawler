Yes, yes indeed, free from school responsibilities. Between now and September, I have to write six short poems and one short story of about 2,000 words. Since I've written somewhere in the region of eight thousand words in the last few weeks, that shouldn't be too much of a killer.

Now I feel like I should get a job or something, except that when my student loan is sitting in my bank and looking like the largest amount of money I've ever seen in my life -- large enough to survive the next two years on even if I didn't get any more money from any source whatsoever -- it is really not an appealing prospect. It is a dilemma."

Wow. I never thought I'd say that, but really, when the past three days have been filled with Frankenstein and Sense and Sensibility (even if I have discovered, despite all my determination to the contrary, that I rather like the latter, though not as much as Persuasion) and the next three days promise to be filled with Oliver Twist, my brain just cries out for a little TV, a little harmless internet time. Oh, hey, I'm on the internet right now. I really shouldn't be.

I think I need to read more in general, because I'm sure I used to be able to read faster. I guess it's possible that I used to read books with larger print, and I guess Dickens is far more brain-leak-causing than Harry Potter, but still, I feel I should not be struggling to get through 150 pages in eight hours. Maybe the fact that the majority of the books are boring and I keep getting distracted is not a great help. I envy my RP character's work ethic. That is quite sad.

Ooh, ooh, and speaking of RP characters, things are proceding apace for the big tabletop game next year, which I am unreasonably excited about for something that is almost six months away. I have been making up my character and obsessively scouring supplements for PrCs and feats and spells, and trying to get her backstory and personality settled, and changing her backstory and personality when I realised she was a HORRIBLE clone of Elizabeth Haydon's Rhapsody, one of the worst canon-sues ever written, and then changing my choice of PrC, and then--

Well, you get the picture. I am so desperate to distract myself from Oliver Twist that I started reading the Book of Exalted Cheese earlier, although that didn't last long before I wanted to gouge my eyes out with a spork. My paladin for this term will just have to live without exalted feats, which I guess is probably just as well, since some of them are rather overpowered and he is already a horrible munchkin.

See, our game (one of them, the other is playtesting for next year's house rules, and I have discovered that I LOVE playing drawfs) is Council of Wyrms, which is a second edition campaign adapted by our DM (who remembers first edition) for 3.5. All the PCs are dragons of varying colours in a world where the normal alignments are scrapped in favour of being pro-dragon and anti-human where the humans have practically wiped the dragons off the map, though the old alignments show themselves in some racial prejudices which make for very entertaining roleplay. --Anyway, I ramble somewhat. I'm playing gold which, as you can imagine, makes me considerably overpowered compared to the green and the little brass, and even though the campaign is designed so that the relative power levels don't actually matter too much, did I ever feel guilty when I looked at all the comparitive stats.

Hmm. Can I ramble any more? I think it's relatively clear by now that I'm just procrastinating. I should go and read some more.

It turns out the IMAX is just a normal cinema where the screen is too big for you to see all of at once so you don't know where you're supposed to be looking, and where the volume is turned up about three times louder than usual. 300 wasn't as awesome as I had been lead to believe, either. On the plus side, it had lots of buff guys wearing not very much and the cinematography was beautiful, but on the minus side it had no plot and no character development and everyone had really weird accents and it was kind of boring.

In other news, dark HFC Piotr has taken over my head and will not go away. I would totally play his arc if I didn't like him as an X-Man and wouldn't have to wait like three years to get to the good bits. Damn. Maybe I should just app an HFC character."

Unfortunately, I have very little to say. Hrm. New laptop is still fairly sucky although it hasn't actually exploded yet, as such. Possibly this is because I am hardly using it, since our uni firewall BLOCKS SIMPLEMU on wireless connections. It's blatantly not dangerous since it's fine for use on lab PCs, but I can't use it from my own computer.

Not that that matters so much, since I can't get an internet connection in my room, although I have a cunning plan to find a wireless antenna of some sort and run it out of my door and under the double doors into the section of the corridor where I am sitting now, which has teh wireless. The slow wireless, but teh wireless nonetheless. Possibly nonetehless. Depends how much I want to keep up the stupid internet misspellings.

Also, I have discovered that people should not let me scene when it's 4AM and I'm feeling slightly crazy. I'm sure my characters would appreciate it if people stopped me from doing this.

Our house is on a corner, so there are (quiet) roads on two sides of our front garden, and it has quite a low wall.

Today my dad came home, and asked if my mum had done anything with the slide. Now, while my mum and my dad have just separated and are engaged in a messy war of attrition, thus making this quite possible, she assures me that she had nothing to do with its vanishing. Thus, there is only one possible explanation: it was slidenapped!

Some guys must have come along with a van and just absconded with it in the middle of the night. My dad and I discussed this, and despite the fact that we'd just been robbed, neither of us could keep a straight face. I think both of us were picturing a group of guys staggering around with this slide with getaway music playing in the background.

So, farewell slide, I hope you find a new and happy life where you are slid far more often than you were by my brother and I, both of whom have been too large for you since before we moved here."

"event","<p>Hello world!&nbsp;Or rather, hello three or four people who've followed a link here from a comment I've left somewhere. I'm a realistic person, and I don't expect to become one of those world-famous bloggers everyone recognises. In fact, I've tried to write journals before and so far they've all died out. I have no reason to believe this one will be any different, but if I can keep it up for a month or two then that's a couple of months in which I've done just a little more writing than I otherwise would have which is, as my creative writing lecturer keeps telling me, a Good Thing. So, this journal is being written for largely for my own benefit. If anyone happens to read it, that's cool too. Just in case, I'll tell you&nbsp;a little bit about myself.<br /><br />I'm English and a university student, reading English and Creative Writing. This consists of about five hours of lectures and seminars a week, and so leaves me with a lot of research time. I do research! Really! You may be surprised to hear it, but I do. I don't have a job, but it probably couldn't hurt to get one to try and fend off the poor student stereotype that already seems to be hitting a lot of the girls along&nbsp;my corridor. Oh yes, I live in a hall of residence that is a castle on the outside and an institutional battery farm on the inside. The corridor is wider than my bedroom. It also doesn't have internet access, except in strange places such as sitting on the floor under the table at the end of the corridor, so I'm always online from computer labs. Once I get a new laptop (I've killed two now from overuse) I'll be searching out the wireless hotspots around campus for more glamourous surroundings while I surf. I'll post pictures. I may even challenge you to find a more attractive place to hook up to the internet.<br /><br />Educational things aside, I should tell you now that I am a geek. I revel in my geekdom and will make no excuses for it (except for the really, really sad bits, perhaps). If you've read this far and want the last few seconds of your life back, I'm sorry but you really should have read the title of this LJ. Mock me for my geekiness and I will delete your comment. I have this internet thing where I can do that. It's as simple as that. On the other hand, if you want to geek with me, then post and rejoice! My geekiness goes in cycles and I tend to have one thing that is a current obsession as well as a hoard of background fandoms that I will love forever. The most persistent fandoms are Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. I like Harry Potter and love Discworld, and will generally read or watch anything sci-fi or fantasy. My current main obsession is&nbsp;X-Men, a fandom I've&nbsp;been in love with&nbsp;since the&nbsp;dire cartoons in the nineties, brougth back to life by the recent films. I'm in&nbsp;an excellent&nbsp;X-Men&nbsp;RPG, which you will undoubtedly hear about in&nbsp;later posts.&nbsp;I am also, along with&nbsp;the wonderful Kiishka, in the (slow) process of&nbsp;creating and writing my own sci-fi epic, called Ten Seconds.<br /><br />Back in the real world, I love to act and sing and have been in loads of shows since the age of about five. I tend to play the old women, and I even won a NODA award for playing Aunt Eller from Oklahoma! when I was about fifteen. No, it wasn't really a big deal back then, either. I also spent the summer of 2005 working backstage with the National Youth Theatre, making props and scenery for their productions The Steadfast Tin Soldier and Antigone at Hell's Mouth. It was a horrible summer, and I probably only mentioned it just then because I got into personal statement writing mode.<br /><br />I think that's it for now, so I'll sign off. Expect to see me again!</p>"

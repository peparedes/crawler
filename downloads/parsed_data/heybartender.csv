An email I had to send recently: 

<i>Hi *Account Rep at a local floral/gift basket company*!

I wanted to get back to you with regards to our Holiday gift baskets. I'm very sad to report that we've actually got a number of factors working against us right now that indicate that we're probably going to have to skip our Holiday gift baskets entirely this year. 
 
First off, *old company name* was acquired by *new company home office* at the very end of 2007. As such, we are now under a new corporate structure which has severely affected the marketing budget available to our office for such purchases, as well as affecting my freedom to choose the companies we work with for such things. 
 
Our next obstacle is that our client schools are increasingly telling us that they have been unable to accept such gift baskets due to their own institution regulations regarding gifts from vendors. We actually at least a dozen of our baskets that were not even opened last year due to the fact that our clients are under increasing pressure to not accept gifts from vendors- and that was just the ones we knew about.  Where previously these were just regulations that affected state institutions, we're now seeing more and more that similar regulations are affecting our private school clients as well. Unfortunately, this has become part of our reality that we are no longer able to provide anything to our client schools of more than 'token' value.  
 
The third and most current issue is of course the economy. That's not to say that there is no money for gifts this year, but that given the current financial climate of our country, we are no doubt going to be facing increased insurance costs for our clients in the coming months. To continue to send gifts during such a time doesn't send the right message to our clients that we are doing whatever we can to avoid significant rate increases to their insurance program. 
 
In discussions with my senior management, it seems that the prevailing decision  is to indicate to our clients that we will be foregoing our annual holiday gift baskets this year and instead offer a larger contribution to our company's scholarship program. And perhaps in another year, discuss a smaller type of gift that would be able to be accepted by clients without hesitation. 
 
The reason I go into all of this detail is that I want you to know that this decision is in no way related to the products or service that we have received from *Gift Basket Company Name*. You have been nothing but dependable, professional and flexible in your work with us over these past years, and we have always been happy at the quality of the products and service of the company. If and when the situation arises where we are in a position to do so, I look forward to the opportunity to work with you again in the future. 
 
All the best, 
 
*****

----------------------------------------
And his reply this morning...

<i>Dear Julie,

I apologize for taking so much time to reply back to you. I deeply appreciate the amount of time you spent writing to me about your current situation. Wow, it's been a rough year - losing *my company name* really hurt and I've been having to work even longer hours and really push hard to stay afloat. Things are slowly starting to shape-up now but the first month of the season was tremendously difficult. You are a great person to work with. I want to thank you for the gracious and enjoyable way you have done business with me these past few years.

I do want you to know, just in case some shift occurs, that we are offering heavily discounted shipping this year, free custom imprinted ribbon, and nice basket discounts. As always, we can also meet any budget and price point. Okay, that's my brief pitch.

I ask that you keep me in mind if anything changes and I appreciate the kind words. Again I thank you so much for taking the time to write me and explain everything in detail - though it should not be the case it is a rare occurrence. May you have a happy Thanksgiving and great holiday season. Let's hope the economy shapes-up in 2009 and we can start a conversation again then.

Warmest Regards, 

*Account Rep*
Director of Sales
*Gift Basket Company Name*"

I hate what politics brings out in a lot of people (myself included) and despite not being pleased with the specific outcome, the idea of something, anything different is good right now. My only worry is that we're putting so much faith into someone we know so little about. BUT, though I can and will fight for the individual things that I do not agree with, I look forward to this new president proving me wrong. 

...and hey- if nothing else, it gets Deval Patrick & John Kerry out of Massachusetts and well- that's not a bad thing either!

I spent last night at Senator Bob Hedlund's Election party down in Hull. I've known Senator Hedlund for many years now, and when I finally moved into his constituency 2 years ago, I started barraging him with ideas i've had, and we joke that we're now facebook buddies. Last night I had some very good conversations with him, his campaign manager and the new head of the Republican Committee about getting myself involved. I'm amazed at how hard it has been to find ways to be involved in anything even remotely Republican in this area, so hopefully now that i've thrown my arms in the air and said ""I'M HERE AND I WANT TO HELP!"" I will start getting calls. Expect to see me sitting on Town Council within 2 years. 

Anyway- last night I didn't get to sleep until midnight, and was woken up by 3:30AM with a horrible Migraine. It was just one one side of my head, but it hurt like hell and putting pressure on it just made it worse. It seriously felt like I had an aneurysm, and all I could do was lay there and wish for death. It was THAT BAD. Thankfully, it seems I did eventually get back to sleep and I haven't had any reoccurence today. But it's so bad that during that intense pain, all I could think was ""OMG. This pain is so bad that I won't even be able to pick up a phone to call in to work or cancel any of my other appointments. I am literally going to have to have Dave stay home to take care of me because I cannot even move my face right now."" 

So now it's November 5th, and my hope is that at the very least- companies that I am approaching for show sponsorship will be a bit more eager to open their wallets now that we at least have closure one one major world event. As always- we shall see!"

"event","I'm so sad, and my advance apologies- this is going to be dramatic. 

Today when I come home, we'll be back to being a one-cat family. Tessie is being brought back to the shelter today. 

Because I didn't ever really give a backstory on her, i'll do so now. We got Tessie back in November as a cat FOR Oswald. He was just insanely needy, and we thought getting another cat would give him someone to play with and otherwise occupy him. 

Enter Tessie... the little gray tiger cat who we got from the same shelter as Oz. She had come into the shelter pregnant, and when we got her, her kittens had all been adopted out and she had just been fixed. She was teeny, talkative, and adorable. 

Well, Oz & Tessie never really learned to love each other. Initial meetings were very tense and involved much flying fur. Oswald seemed to despise us for bringing another cat into his castle, and Tessie was just petrified of this giant, orange beast who harassed her constantly. 

Over time, they learned to tolerate each other, though Oswald has always been a bastard and always terrorizes her when he's bored. It was their occasional moments of cuteness together (grooming one another, bonding over the food bowl) that kept us optimistic that they would eventually be friends. 

I believe it was February when Tessie started peeing on things. It started with a purse, then my bra, then Dave's hat, then the bath mat... We brought her to the vet to rule out a UTI, and also asked him for his recommendations (adding another litter box, making sure litter was scooped all the time, etc.). If these didn't work, the vet said, the next step was therapy and/or kitty drugs. 

Well, it worked for awhile. We started making sure the bedroom door was shut at all times (much to Oswald's dismay), the bathroom door was always shut, that there were always two litter boxes (one with a hood, one without. One with crystals, one with clay) available, and that they were scooped multiple times during the day. We bought the Feliway Diffuser (expensive!) and have kept refilling it. All of this had seemed to work and life was better. We also made sure that no clothing items or anything that smelled like us was ever on the ground where Tessie could get to it. The cats were still fighting a lot, but we assumed that it was just playfulness at this point. 

But then last week, she randomly peed on one of our air mattresses that we had set up for a guest. Not a huge deal, but still a pain, of course. We chalked it up to a fluke. 

Then last night, she did the one thing that Dave & I had previously talked about the possibility of, and had determined to be a no-second-chances, automatic dealbreaker: she peed on the bed. I had left the bedroom door open for a couple of hours while I was folding & putting away laundry, and though I noticed her lounging on the bed at one point, I figured at this point that we were 'safe' and that she could be trusted to lay there for a bit (she's done this before without a problem). Apparently I was wrong. 

So the decision has been made that we have done absolutely all we can do for her. I hope that her time at the shelter will be brief, that she will find a family where she can be the only cat and that she can continue to be the cute little potato-shaped cat that we came to love without the stress of a dominant male cat to put her over the edge. 

As for Oswald... he will remain a solo cat, with the eventual next animal (not anytime soon) being a dog that will hopefully put him in his place. I'm mad at him right now for putting us in this situation, but I keep reminding myself that they are just animals, and as humans we can only do so much. 

Have a good life, Miss Tessie. Our home will never be the same without you.

"event","My dear husband has taken to using technology to help him/us sleep, and to annoy the ever-loving hell out of the cats. 

Backstory...We have two darling kitties. You all know Oswald (aka Mr. Personality), whom we adore and spoil rotten. He is very dog-like, and requires constant attention from us. 

In an attempt to have him require less of our time, last November we got HIM a cat. That would be Miss Tessie, who is far more cat-like and very content to disappear and do her own thing for the better part of the day. You'll notice I don't talk about her much, mainly because she's not nearly as dramatic as Oz. 

Well, Oswald & Tessie haven't taken to each other nearly as much as we thought they would have by this point. They have their cute moments together, and they are friends around the food bowl, but for the most part, they do their own thing. Which does not fix the Oswald neediness issue. 

One of the things that Oswald does regularly is to cry, scream and scratch outside our bedroom door at about 4:30AM, until one of us gets up to feed him. Often times, he'll do this even when he has food- he just wants the company. Mind you, Tessie is somewhere else sleeping during all of this. 

Now I am perfectly capable of sleeping through Oswald's cries, and have done so regularly. Dave? Not so much. Instead, he's taken to throwing things at the door, dumping entire glasses of water on the cat, and slamming the door shut until Oz stops yelling- which only ends up being temporary anyway. 

Well, all that seems to be ending, as Dave has taken matters to the technology gods. He has purchased one of these: 
<IMG SRC=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ABHMQZNJL._SL500_AA280_.jpg""><br>

If you can't tell, it's a remote control for an outlet. 

Folks, I am not kidding when I tell you that he was GIDDY when the package arrived yesterday. He could not wait to go to sleep to try out the new toy. 

...because now, when Oswald starts yelling, the vacuum cleaner is turned on automatically outside our bedroom door. 

This morning it began, and it only took two times for Oswald to go into hiding for the remainder of the morning. Poor Tessie is collateral damage, mainly because she's afraid of everything and hides every time she hears ANY loud noise. 

Hopefully, it won't take long to enforce the idea that Crying outside the bedroom door = loud, scary noises.

But oh, the irony in the fact that, while I can sleep easily through Oswald's yells, I can't sleep through... the vacuum."

Banana Walnut is good, but i'm not so much a banana fan so I'm not reordering those. But yeah, they've been my breakfast (with a piece of fruit) for the last couple weeks and i'm not sick of them yet. Two thumbs up!"

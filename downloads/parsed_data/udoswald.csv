<b>This journal is friends only because I value my sanity.</b>

Adding me does not mean I have to add you back. 

<b>Possible reasons I didn't add you/add you back:</b>
You're under 18 and act accordingly
You speak entirely in that annoying language kids on the internet use (see previous)
Your entire journal is lamenting the latest boyfriend/girlfriend to dump your sorry ass 
You constantly misspell words, or worse use intentionally misspelled words, e.g.:
<i>u for you
k for ok (how lazy do you have to be that you can't spell out ok?)
liek, teh, etc...</i>
You're a right-winger who refuses to respect those with differing viewpoints
You refuse to admit when G. W. Bush does something stupid (which is often) or evil (see previous)
You're friends with certain people who have disrupted this journal in the past. I will look at your friends list before I add you.

<b>This policy is set in stone. Interpretation is up to me. This is my journal and I will choose who I friend. I will not have this journal degenerate into the shouting match it was before.</b>"

i love my college, i love the city that my college is located in, i love the people in my hall, and im not writing this piece on a bench in a park, more the college life-like status of in the dorm room at 12:36 after finishing some math and spanish homework and procrastinating on my Terror Trance Technology class, which i must say i absolutely love that class...have you ever felt so like inspired and questioning everything you have read and learned for the past 13 years of your life? its so ridiculous but its so fuckin amazing...ah the college life and college classes, what me liking school only took 13 years for that to happen...hahaha...or the fact that every second im in a classroom at this school its costin me 2 cents or somethin like that.

but about denver and the people, a girl might have stolen my heart from california, but i dont know if it was just one or like 500...pretty girls, me like, and awesome girls too...and most of them like hockey (are you serious)!!!!

but yeah, have been invited to montana to spend christmas with this one girl so that i can experience a ""white christmas"" if i'd like...and ive also been invited to stay out here and just hang out in the mountains...oh man are you kiddin me, love the kids here...but dont worry im coming home

my roomate is freakin awesome...the hallmates are freakin awesome...plus when you are at a private school, or any college for that matter, the kids are here to learn and not just dick off, its great, plus they are all pretty damn smart kids and some of these kids are gonna be important political figures no doubt

and the sports atmosphere is fantastic...everybody loves the broncos, everybody loves the avalanche, and everybody loves denver pioneers hockey...the hockey games are gonna be fuckin awesome

the one thing that sux about here tho is the cops are fuckin anal about parking...spent 168 dollars on parkin tickets and permit in 2 days...fuck that

""yeah so did you have fun tonite?""
""well yeah sorta i mean i had her sittin in my lap""
""thatta boy""
""yeah, i guess, but she kept like hittin me in the face with her hair and i told her to stop""
""hate when girls do that""
""so she stopped then i guess i said somethin and she started bouncin on my thigh""
""wait she was bouncin on your thigh?""
""yeah, well shes got a relatively big ass...""
""yeah but shes hot""
""yeah she is...but anyways, so shes got a big ass so shes more like bouncin in my pelvic region but the force is really on my thigh""
""thatta boy, so you did have a goodnite""
""well heres the best part, i still dont have her number""
""oh man wasted effort, wasted effort for sure""
""not really, i put no effort in and look what i got""

man, richard and i have deep conversations

and when i do put effort into a person, the person gets retarded...i cant wait to move to colorado just so that 17 hours may finally detach myself from her...i mean seriously 2 years now...a lot of off and on but for some reason have always liked this person

her bro is on the hockey team and she is ridicuously cute and a freshman and a hockey chick and rich so i think i got the trifecta

but then again, i dont want to leave, i dont want to go to the snow, i dont want to cuddle next to someone in their cabin in the rocky mountains in the most beautiful landscape in the country, sure there will be cute, rich hockey girls out there, but every place has cute girls and california, especially southern has the best lookin ladies anywhere...alright im about to cry...about 3 more weeks of work, then im quittin so i can hang out with all the califonria ladies that i can...and guys too, if they'd like

"event","To all of you who have called yourselves SENIORS the past few months...WE ARE NOW HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES.  Im so proud of myself, my family, and friends.  The feeling is indescribable.  Just standing in front of the stage gave me worse butterflies than anything any sport has, including state championship games, regional championship games, etc.  CONGRATULATIONS SIMI VALLEY CLASS OF 2005!!!!!

So now on to the memories of the graduation evening, June 21, 2005.
I never knew that we had soo many kids graduating from Simi Valley High School...and i never knew that some of the kids could look so intelligent in their lives.  But the cap and gown made us all look so good and smart and mature, like actually old.

I dont think I will ever forget the look Sarah Grasso had on her face during the whole entire ceremony.  Not hard to spot the ASB PRESIDENT on the platform/stage thing. But she had the widest smile on her face, looking out at her fellow graduates.  Hard to describe but it was just somethin special.  Then Michelle Bernabe throwin her fist in the air after every sentence was hilarious.

Definately going to remember Bernabes speech.  Definately a funny one...

Of course hearing my name called.  ""JOHN THOMAS BLAIR""  I even appreciated the pause in between the names, just awesome and definately blushed a little.  Sorry if I celebrated a little too much but i was way stoked.  And hearing cheering after my name was awesome too.

But unfortunately, all good things come to an end.  Simi Valley High School has been a great place.  Sure you hate it at times but yet you love it even more.  There are those people you just want to beat the shit out of, but then there are more who you wish you could spend the rest of your life with.  There are the close bonds that you promise will never break, the friendships that you wish could last an eternity.  But then the real world and THE MAN ruin that and take all the fun away from everything.  Or maybe you decide to go to Denver for schooling, putting an incredible strain on those bonds.  After graduation i went out to dinner with family and close family friends and after, instead of hanging out with friends and partying, i drove around the eastern end of Simi, starting with the high school.  I visited all the schools that i attended in my educational career and also visited the Santa Susanna Pass Road, to where the first ""pioneers"" of Simi Valley entered the valley before the freeway came in.  Im definately going to miss this valley and everybody that i met in it.  

IM DEFINATELY GOING TO MISS EVERYBODY THAT I HAVE MET IN SIMI VALLEY, CA BUT THE SUMMER HAS JUST BEGUN SO LETS HANG OUT WHEN IM NOT WORKING AND MAKE IT THE BEST SUMMER EVER!  AGAIN CONGRATS AND STAY SAFE"

greeley estates and tear my world apart is like my new favorite song...emo/a little screamo=great

umm school has been awesome...minus the work part...senior year is the coolest thing ever cuz i dont care about anything and its a great place to talk with friends

hockey is takin control of the life...past 3 weekends havent done anythign but hockey but really its all good...the team is great, we are winning, having a lot of fun, we are all close, its seriously like i have 18 brothers, just awesome, and did i mention we are winning this year, 15-5-3

winter break is just what i wanted...outa the house every nite and back home on time so the parents arent mad at me...yet they want me to get a job which i dont want but i need money...any place have good hours (like no weekends, early nites, etc)

but tonite i met a pretty cute chick that was small (i guess i like the small ladies)...but dont worry nothin happened (i dont know how old she is but she is in high school and no i didnt have sex with her)

thats pretty much the recap

oh ive been writin a journal since andrea gave me the idea...we are gonna share em like the last week of school or the week after school...its such a wonderful idea cuz you can put more feelings into it than into livejournal or myspace since you dont have to worry about who is reading it and yeah

stay tuned for the next update which will include top 10 or somethin countdowns...until then...love you all, dont take anything for granted, be nice not naughty cuz santa is comin to town, and straightedge is the way to be"

in iraq:  we have soldiers fightin in the holy city of Najaf...honestly tho...every city it seems is a freakin muslim holy city...is it the muslims sayin ""oh shit the americans are attackin and blowin up our ""holy"" cities...fuck the west and blow up americans.""  contemplate that

kerry/bush:  havent really paid attention to this lately...all i know is that the two campaigns are campaigning in the same cities and states at the same time...oh and on that point of in the same town...kerry and bush were in the same town in ohio...while they were there, 2 banks were robbed in that small town...shouldnt there have been extra security and thus made doin anythin illegal nearly impossible...hmmmm...looks like security will suck with either guy in charge

stupid criminals:  more great stupid criminals...two guys rob a gas station...get half a mile down the road before runnin outa gas...return to the same station with the little gas tanks where they meet the local police.

for a beautiful recap of the political and world events of the past week... read sarah's report at girl_next_door

that'll do for now...dont do anythin stupid now and enjoy your last month of summer"

"event","Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the weekly update brought to you by the awesome John Thomas Blair...in the news today...demcratic national convention, great quotes by politicians in the past month, and the democratic party platform

***the democratic party has kicked off its thrillin convention in boston, massachusettes...this convention is nothin like the original ones where after heated debates and series of votes a candidate would be picked for president...this one is to see what the clintons had to say about each other and how borin of a man john kerry really is...3 purple hearts tho...and i guarentee that you will hear about this 100 more times

***kerry's, wife theresa heinz kerry, has been in the news recently after tellin a reporter to ""SHOVE IT"" when she accused him of misquoting her...actually, upon further television review, the reporter was actually correct and had quoted her correctly...see, reporters can be honest people...anyways, hilary clinton stated ""the woman speaks her mind...YOU GO GIRL.""

***OTHER GREAT QUOTES THE PAST FEW WEEKS***
>>>DICK CHENEY---""F*** yourself""
>>>SCHWARZENAGER---""Girlie Men"" when referrin to california democrats
>>>HEINZ KERRY---""Shove it""

***one of the issues of the democratic platform regards oil...the party says that they will break ties with the middle east oil giants, and not drill in oil rich alaska...so this question must be asked...

""where are we gonna get our oil to go to work...live in our homes...etc?""

GOV OF MICH: ""we are developin new methods includin ethanol""
CHRIS MATHEWS: ""what does your car run on?""
GOV: ""gas""
MATHEWS: ""where does gas come from?""
GOV: ""oil""
MATHEWS: ""where will we get the oil to run your car?""
GOV: ""we are developin new cars that will not need to run on oil""
MATHEWS: ""when will these cars be made ready""
GOV: ""in about 3 years""
MATHEWS: ""but what about the oil that we wont have for those 3 years""
GOV: ""well we have hybrid cars""
MATHEWS: ""do you have a hybrid car""
GOV: ""no, but i will go out and buy one cuz of the situation""
MATHEWS: ""what about those that cant buy a new hybrid car and that wont be able to afford a car that will run on ethanol when they come available""
GOV:  pause and then changes the subject

i have a feelin they might want to tinker with this one

sorry aboutthe length but a few things had to be mentioned...enjoy the week and kerry speaks thursday nite if you care"

<P>the <FONT color=#ff0000>9/11 commission </FONT>has come out with the <FONT color=#cc0000>9/11 commission report </FONT>puttin the blame of<FONT color=#cc0000> 9/11 </FONT>not directly&nbsp;on one person or anything but sayin that congress, intelligence agencies, and the president could have done more to stop the attacks...it took them over 500 pages to say this and <FONT color=#cc0000>president bush</FONT> said he would personally review what the commission had to say...that might take awile</P>
<P>the commission also said that America is safer but not safe enough to prevent another terrorist attack</P>
<P>former clinton national security advisor <FONT color=#cc0000>sandy berger</FONT> has been accused of stealin copies of transcripts or somethin from the national archives...he jacked the papers by <FONT color=#cc0000>stuffin them in his pants</FONT>...whats up with the clinton administration and things in their pants...anyways...berger claimed these practices to be ""<FONT color=#cc0000>sloppy</FONT>""...they are also a little dirty</P>
<P>governor of <FONT color=#cc0000>new jersey </FONT>will mandate the use of report cards to grade children in elementary through middle school on their physical presence...healthy kids get an A and obese kids get an F...so now an F can mean ""failure to be skinny"" or simply ""you are fat""...i think this sux cuz i mean a person that is fat already knows they are fat and doesnt need a f-in report card to&nbsp;tell them&nbsp;that they are obese...i wonder if someone will be re-elected in&nbsp;a few years</P>
<P>and in local news...<FONT color=#cc0000>hollywood</FONT> will be banning the use of <FONT color=#cc0000>silly string </FONT>on <FONT color=#ff6600>halloween nite</FONT>...its been a heated discussion that the city council has been debatin for the last few months...has nothin important been goin on that council members need to spend months thinkin about silly string...other cities are thinkin of followin suit...and its been talked about banning <FONT color=#cc0000>silly string</FONT> entirely...if that happens...im gonna silly string up the joint</P>
<P>thats about it folks...tune in on sometime durin the middle of the week and get the weekly update brought to you by john thomas blair...have a great nite, mornin, or afternoon and dont do anythin to be brought up in these news segments</P>"

<P>well mine was pretty cool.&nbsp; wanted to go to the vball game but it was all the way down in redondo on a friday and i was like fuck that</P>
<P>so i chilled at my house and was way excited due to try-outs.&nbsp; watched peter pan cuz i couldnt sleep so i just decided to watch a movie</P>
<P>saturday woke up and was all excited/nervous/paranoid about hockey...i mean, i have so many expectations for me and one is to make this team...if i make this team then i can go on to my other expectations...plus im goin to minnesota for a huge hockey camp and it would be pointless if i only played A...and i got all my dads hockey friends callin wishin me luck so i got all this pressure to make it for my dad (i always want to do somethin to impress him....hhmmmm...is this good...i think i can never satisfy him tho)</P>
<P>so at try-outs i play well enough i guess to make the team...yay right?...but for some reason i didnt feel all excited cuz i had teammates who played awesome yet didnt make it...yet...and i got all these people congratulatin me so i tried bein modest and i think i came off as like a little bitch...oh well...had a sweet ass goal and me and chao-chao got into a punchin match...ask and ill tell ya at school</P>
<P>then pj, day, downey, and bobs came over after...watched 28 days later...what a f-in weird movie</P>
<P>then sunday played hockey again...had 2 more goals that were ok i guess...more people made the team yet still some of my friends didnt make the team...and one definitely should but hes pretty young&nbsp; so maybe thats why and i want to play with my friends again but i want to beat the ice puppies...oh well...so many options</P>
<P>enough about hockey eh</P>
<P>so kim aint mad at me no more...good news</P>
<P>vball won...game tuesday nite</P>
<P>and off groundin in a week or so...way too long this time...might get home on time next time</P>

"event","<P>well...two ap tests down...and no more to go.&nbsp; yay.&nbsp; next year possibly 6...so excited for next year</P>
<P>lets begin on wednesday tho.&nbsp; go to the vball game and <FONT color=#3333ff>steph, jess, dan, and hammon </FONT>come as well.&nbsp; gay agoura kids put their bags where we sit.&nbsp; oh well.&nbsp; gay game.&nbsp; won easily.&nbsp; but, i almost shed a few tears since it was <FONT color=#3333ff>casey, drew, tommy, and bonsbauch </FONT>(spellin) last game.&nbsp; then i went home</P>
<P>to watch some <FONT color=#ff0000>friends</FONT> cuz that was all that was on.&nbsp; it was like the last two episodes before the really last episode.&nbsp; almost shed a few tears here too since i used to watch it all the time, but not so much now. oh well.</P>
<P>then watch <FONT color=#cc0000>oc</FONT>, and seriously came really close to cryin now.&nbsp; its just a show and <FONT color=#3333ff>ryan</FONT> and <FONT color=#3333ff>seth</FONT> will come back.&nbsp; but like seein <FONT color=#3333ff>seth</FONT>, so calm, dumbwitted, humorous, actually sad made me sad cuz hes almost like me...just he can get the ladies.</P>
<P>yeah, then on thursday actually watch the series finale of <FONT color=#cc0000>friends </FONT>after hockey and a lengthy talk with <FONT color=#3333ff>andrea</FONT>.&nbsp; i think we got a little fixed, or a little of what andrea wanted.&nbsp; did that make sense.&nbsp; so friends was tight...the most emotional moment was when <FONT color=#3333ff>chandler</FONT> and <FONT color=#3333ff>joey</FONT> hugged after bustin the foosball table.&nbsp; saddest part.&nbsp; but it was a gay finale cuz everybody is still around.&nbsp; kill some people off or have em move somewhere, not just another part of the city.</P>
<P>wow...what a long entry...but there is still more...</P>
<P>so today was ap history.&nbsp; really would have liked a 5 but dont think that will happen, will settle for a 4 but the multiple choice might have fucked me.&nbsp; actually sorta hard.</P>
<P>but the essays...thats where i did good except the dbq.&nbsp; but its hard to write an essay with a song stuck in your head.&nbsp; and that song was <FONT color=#006600 size=4>the reason&nbsp;by hoobastank.&nbsp; <FONT color=#000000>i mean everything i wrote about had to do with reasons and that song just kept bein played over and over in my head.&nbsp; like the rythm and the last two lines of the chorus.&nbsp; pretty gay.&nbsp; but still a good song.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>ok...so tomorrow hockey and nothin.&nbsp; sunday=hockey and nothin</FONT></P>

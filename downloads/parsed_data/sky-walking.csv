<lj-cut text=""Obi-Wan pulled back from the kiss after what seemed like a brief eternity."">
Obi-Wan pulled back from the kiss after what seemed like a brief eternity. He stared at Anakin's mouth, smiling softly. They were quiet for a long moment, with nothing but the gentle rhythmic crash of the waves against the shore and the soft breath of the wind to break their silence. Anakin shivered after a moment, feeling a bit chilled by the cool water swirling around his bare ankles.

""Well. This is awkward,"" said Obi-Wan, chuckling softly and pulling away. The large moon was high in the clear night sky, putting silver around the edges of everything Anakin could see, leaving strange shadows on Obi-Wan's bearded face.

Anakin took Obi-Wan's left hand in his own and tugged.  ""Let's go back to the house."" It was nice, just to be able to touch Obi-Wan. They had been apart, physically and mentally, too long.

Obi-Wan glanced back at the ocean stretching out behind them, then nodded, almost shyly. He followed Anakin's lead, pausing only to make sure they picked up their boots.  Anakin never let go of Obi-Wan's hand, even when he wound up walking awkwardly backward up the kitchen stairs. Instead, he just smiled at Obi-Wan, enjoying himself too much to care about little things like not being able to see where he was going. Besides, his awareness of the Force prevented him from falling. When they got inside the house, Anakin pulled Obi-Wan close for another kiss.

Obi-Wan kissed back slowly, winding the folds of Anakin's blue tunic around his fingers. He drew back for a breath, taking a moment before speaking. ""This might be a little fast...""

""Hmm?"" Anakin murmured, looking at Obi-Wan with more happiness than he had in years. He tilted his head, a half-smile curving his lips.

""I said... this might be going a little fast."" Obi-Wan's lips hovered near Anakin's, his eyes bright and blue as he stared at him meaningfully.

""Did you want to stop?"" Anakin wasn't going to jeopardize this fragile peace between them by doing anything Obi-Wan didn't want.

""I'm not... sure.""

Anakin leaned forward and brushed his lips against Obi-Wan's. ""I don't want to. But I can wait.""

Obi-Wan kissed him again, surprisingly gentle but for the scratch of his beard. ""This just seems so sudden, though I suppose it really isn't.""

Anakin stroked Obi-Wan's face. ""No, but we can go slow anyway."" It would actually be a pleasure to take his time, to learn Obi-Wan's body and mind even more intimately than he had before, when they'd been only friends.

""Slow would be... nice,"" Obi-Wan whispered. His fingers ran over Anakin's face and neck, meeting him for another kiss, sliding his tongue into Anakin's mouth.

Anakin's tongue slid against Obi-Wan's. He settled one hand on Obi-Wan's hip and cupped the back of Obi-Wan's neck with the other. He knew they wanted to go slow, but he was getting hard just from this. The feeling of Obi-Wan against him soothed parts of him he hadn't realized were hurting.

To Anakin's surprise, Obi-Wan murmured, ""It's not very comfortable to do this against a kitchen counter,"" between kisses.

Anakin tightened his grip on Obi-Wan's hip. ""Did you have another location in mind?""

""Maybe someplace softer..."" Obi-Wan smiled against Anakin's mouth, his beard tickling Anakin's chin. ""I am an old man, you know.""

""Mmm,"" Anakin said, ""I can think of just the place."" He rubbed himself against Obi-Wan once before detaching himself just enough to start walking them to the bedroom. He froze when he realized Luke was standing in the doorway, eyes wide.

""Daddy? Ben?""

It was like walking into a freezing cold shower. Obi-Wan detached himself immediately, and despite the dark of the kitchen, his face was red as a crimberry.  ""Luke,"" he said, his voice somewhat strangled. He bent down until he was eye level with the boy, using the Force to flip on the kitchen lights. ""What's wrong?""

""I wanted a glass of water,"" Luke said, clutching his stuffed bantha. He paused for a second, frowning. ""Are you and Daddy going to be like Daddy and Mommy?""

Obi-Wan's mouth worked, but no sound came out. He eventually closed it, swallowing rapidly.

Anakin stepped forward and picked Luke up, supporting him with one hand while looking for a glass with the other. ""Not quite,"" he told Luke. ""Mommy will still be Mommy, and I will still love her, but Ben and I are going to love each other, too. Okay?""

Luke nodded solemnly, apparently finding nothing out of the ordinary about this arrangement. He limply kicked his legs, waiting as Anakin found a glass in the cabinet, then maneuvered it under the water dispenser, filling it up. When he handed it to Luke, Luke only smiled and sipped at the water, holding onto the glass with both hands.

Anakin smiled back and ruffled Luke's hair. ""Let's get you back to bed."" He looked up at Obi-Wan, still smiling.

Obi-Wan was still blushing, but he'd stood up, busying himself with straightening out his clothing. ""I -- I'm going to head back to the compound. I do have classes to run tomorrow. I can come back in a few days."" He was obviously speaking to Anakin, but looking at Luke.

""We'll be waiting for you,"" Anakin said warmly.

Luke waved. ""Bye, Ben.""

""Good-bye, both of you.""

Obi-Wan smiled and slinked out, his face still flushed with embarrassment.

Luke finished his glass of water and smiled at Anakin. ""Ben gets funny when people kiss him, Daddy. Just so's you know,"" he said solemnly.

Anakin took the glass of water from Luke and put it on the counter. He would wash it in the morning. ""I know. He'll get better. I promise."" He ruffled Luke's hair again.

Luke smiled again, his small face lighting up, and he rested his head against Anakin's shoulder, allowing himself to be carried off to bed.

<center>~~~~~~</center>

Obi-Wan didn't return for three days, and then only to pick up Luke and Leia for their training. He seemed strangely shy again, though not necessarily distant. Anakin asked him to come back that evening, and Obi-Wan promised he would, after dinner.

Almost as if on cue, just as Anakin was cleaning up after his evening meal, he heard the hum of a speeder outside.  It abruptly shut off. There was a knock on the front door only a few moments later.  Anakin opened the door, torn between anticipation and anxiety. He knew Obi-Wan wanted this as much as he did, but Obi-Wan could have changed his mind. So much had happened between them that it was entirely possible.

""Hi.""

""Hello,"" said Obi-Wan, smiling a bit, though he didn't quite meet Anakin's gaze. He shifted awkwardly from foot to foot. ""How are you?""

""Good,"" Anakin said, unsure of what to do. ""Did you want to come in?"" He stepped back, giving Obi-Wan room to enter the house if he wanted to.

""Of course."" Obi-Wan breezed past Anakin into the sitting room, walking lightly and stiffly, making sure not to touch Anakin. He kept his gaze neutral, flicking around the room as he entered. He paused, then: ""Luke and Leia are doing well. Master Yoda would like for you and Padme to seriously consider letting them become Padawans.""

""I..."" Anakin wasn't sure what to say. He had to discuss this with Padme, of course, but his feelings on the twins becoming Jedi were mixed. ""You won't take them away from us?""

""Of course not. Little would change. Master Yoda feels the Jedi Order failed by not changing, when the Sith had. He feels strength could be found through family and attachments, but we should teach control and resistance to the dark side.""

""Good."" Anakin's deepest, and only, fear was in losing his children. They were the center of his life. ""I'll talk to Padme, but if that's what they want..."" Anakin trailed off, sighing.

""It is up to the four of you. Master Yoda is eager to train them, as am I, but... it is up to you. Yoda is also very interested in taking Leia as his apprentice.""

Anakin had to laugh at that. He tried to imagine Leia and Yoda paired and could not. They were far too different. ""I'll talk to Padme,"" he repeated, and tentatively stepped closer to Obi-Wan.

Obi-Wan tensed slightly. ""And I think I'd like to train Luke,"" he said quietly. ""I think I could help him better than I did you.""

Once again, Anakin found himself lost for words. After what had happened between himself and Obi-Wan, he was afraid. At the same time, he knew Obi-Wan had changed as much in the past five years as he himself had. Obi-Wan was probably right.

""Yes,"" he said. ""But let me help? A little?"" Anakin knew they would never allow him to take a Padawan, but he wanted to help train his children.

""Of course. They're still your children. Things are different now. For all the Jedi. There might have even been some good from what happened.""

Anakin lowered his eyes and looked away from Obi-Wan. ""We can only hope.""

""Your children gave you hope. They gave me hope. They gave Padme hope. And they even gave Yoda hope. Hope is important.""

""Yes,"" Anakin breathed, moving closer to Obi-Wan. ""And so is love.""

Obi-Wan finally met Anakin's gaze, his expression full of an intensity and passion he rarely displayed. ""Yes.""

Anakin took Obi-Wan's gaze as a sign that his advances were welcome and pulled Obi-Wan into a soft kiss. Obi-Wan's lips were warm and dry, and the scratch of his beard was pleasant.  Obi-Wan kissed back after a moment's hesitance, reaching up to stroke Anakin's face. His fingers felt moist, probably from his palms sweating. It seemed odd that Obi-Wan was nervous for his palms to sweat.

Anakin tangled his fingers in Obi-Wan's hair, drawing out the kiss. Eventually, he pulled back to study Obi-Wan's face. ""All right?""

Obi-Wan's eyes were half-lidded, a soft smile on his lips. ""Yes. Very much so,"" he whispered, then kissed Anakin again, clutching Anakin's face.

Anakin melted into Obi-Wan. It was possible he wanted to hold that well-loved body to him forever, but the demands of biology interfered. ""Mmm. Bed?""

Obi-Wan pulled back a little, licking his lips. He stared at a point past Anakin's shoulder as he spoke. ""Are you sure?"" he asked.

Anakin had considered this long and hard, and had realized that he trusted Obi-Wan. Real trust, this time. There was no fear in him now. He took Obi-Wan's chin in his hand and made Obi-Wan look him in the eye. ""Yes.""

Obi-Wan smiled, taking Anakin gently by the hand, heading down the narrow, darkened hallway to his bedroom. He still looked shy, but... happy.  Anakin was smiling, too, as they entered the dark bedroom. Everything smelled fresh and clean, as Anakin had changed the sheets just that morning, and the white walls and sheets looked blue in the starlight streaming in through the window over the wide bed.

""Love you,"" Anakin murmured into Obi-Wan's ear.

""Love you, too,"" said Obi-Wan, very quietly, turning to kiss Anakin again, trailing his fingers over the sides of Anakin's face. ""Do you... know what you want to do...?"" he asked delicately between kisses.

""Not really,"" Anakin said. He hadn't really thought about that. ""I thought you..."" Anakin didn't think he had a right to make demands of Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan should make demands of him.

""What?"" asked Obi-Wan quietly, pulling back to look at him curiously.

""You decide."" Anakin was the one being shy now. ""You have the experience.""

Obi-Wan's smile was brief. ""Not much, I'm afraid."" He ran his fingers through Anakin's hair. ""I don't want to... press anything.""

""You can,"" Anakin insisted. ""I trust you.""

Obi-Wan looked a little perplexed. ""This won't work if this isn't mutual."" He licked his lips, beard twitching, and leaned forward to kiss Anakin again. ""We'll just... take this slowly.""

Anakin returned the kiss, gently pressing his tongue against Obi-Wan's lips. Padme had taught him how to kiss, and for that, he was grateful.  Obi-Wan's tongue met Anakin's, sliding against it. He tasted of tea. Anakin slid his hands down Obi-Wan's body, wanting to feel skin. It had been a long time since he had been this close to Obi-Wan, and he had missed it.  Obi-Wan awkwardly tried to lead them to the bed without breaking the kiss.  Anakin managed to follow Obi-Wan's lead to the bed, despite the fact that he was fiddling with the ties of Obi-Wan's sash. Obi-Wan was wearing too many clothes.

Obi-Wan paused when their legs bumped against the bed. He grabbed Anakin's hand, forcing him to stop for a moment, holding his gaze. ""If you don't like something I do, tell me. I'll do the same. This is for both of us.""

Anakin nodded slowly. As much as he wanted Obi-Wan to have charge of this, he also knew that they had to talk to each other if it was going to work. ""Yes.""

""Good."" Obi-Wan's hands glided down to Anakin's waist. He lifted up the edge of the dark tunic, lightly stroking the skin he found underneath.  Anakin's skin felt electrified as Obi-Wan touched him. There was no doubt about whether he would be able to do this now; he was quite hard. He succeeded in opening Obi-Wan's tunic, breath hitching as he ran his hands over Obi-Wan's smooth skin.

Obi-Wan let out a puff of air, shivering a little at the touch. He'd run both hands under Anakin's tunic now, stroking Anakin's chest and belly, lifting Anakin's tunic up to explore his upper torso.  Anakin made a small sound, his body singing. This was almost better than Padme, because this was new, and strange, and <i>Obi-Wan</i>. He pushed Obi-Wan's tunic off his shoulders, desperate to see.

Obi-Wan was more slender than Anakin had supposed underneath all his tunics, but still well-muscled by years of combat training. His skin was pale, shining in the starlight. He shrugged his tunics completely off, then reached out to tug Anakin's tunic off, urging his arms upwards.  Anakin allowed Obi-Wan to pull his tunics off, but he was distracted by staring at Obi-Wan. He hadn't seen Obi-Wan unclothed in a long time, and he had forgotten how beautiful Obi-Wan could be.

Obi-Wan pulled Anakin close, the bare skin of their chests meeting in a mild jolt of heat. ""What's wrong?"" asked Obi-Wan, his voice breathy.

""Nothing,"" Anakin said, his voice shaky. ""You're so gorgeous.""

Obi-Wan smiled. ""Perhaps. But I think you're more so,"" he said softly, kissing Anakin's chin, his hands sliding up and down Anakin's back, over his shoulder blades.

Anakin caressed Obi-Wan's flanks. Obi-Wan's skin was hot to the touch, and softer than Anakin had expected. He petted Obi-Wan's belly.  Obi-Wan had put a little weight during his middle age, his waist a bit soft and thick, though quite pleasantly so. Obi-Wan slid his hands down to the waistband of Anakin's trousers, hooking his fingers around them, pulling them down Anakin's hips slightly and then pausing.

""It's all right,"" Anakin whispered. ""Go on."" He moved his own hands to Obi-Wan's hips, sliding them into Obi-Wan's leggings.

Trembling a little, Obi-Wan slid Anakin's trousers off his hips, until they slid down his legs into a puddle at Anakin's ankles with a loud rustle of cloth. Obi-Wan gently rested his palms against Anakin's hips, hovering for a moment before skin met skin.  Anakin's cock was hard, and light glinted off the drop of moisture at the tip. Anakin liked the way Obi-Wan's hands felt against him, and wished they would move. He started pushing Obi-Wan's leggings down, wanting them to be on equal footing.

Obi-Wan removed his hands long enough to help Anakin with his leggings and take his boots off. He wasn't meeting Anakin's gaze, staring at the pile of clothes on the floor as he gestured at the bed. ""We should at least make this comfortable,"" he said.

Anakin was a little worried about the fact that Obi-Wan wouldn't meet his eyes. ""Yes,"" he said, climbing on the bed and extending his hand for Obi-Wan to join him.

Obi-Wan took his hand and slid onto the bed next to him. He finally met Anakin's gaze as their naked bodies together, and to Anakin's relief, he simply looked nervous. He kissed Anakin again, his arms wrapping around him.  Anakin made a noise in his throat as their bodies met, cocks brushing against each other. This felt so easy with Obi-Wan. They were where they were supposed to be, and it felt good.

Lying comfortably against Anakin, Obi-Wan nuzzled against Anakin's neck, his hands rubbing over Anakin's back, his hair, his shoulders, and after some hesitation, reaching down to cup his ass.  Anakin licked Obi-Wan's ear, tasting the shell. His only reaction to the movement of Obi-Wan's hands was to move closer to Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan made a very soft noise, gently kneading the flesh under his hands, pressing Anakin against him even more tightly, his hard cock digging into Anakin's left hip.  Anakin practically purred with contentment, and rubbed himself against Obi-Wan's cock. He wanted Obi-Wan to feel good. He deserved it.

Obi-Wan moved up to kiss the corner of Anakin's jaw. ""I forgot how good it feels to be so close to someone, but it's always better when you're with someone you love,"" he whispered.

""Mmm,"" Anakin said. ""I want you to feel good."" He caressed Obi-Wan's back and ran his hands over Obi-Wan's ass. ""Tell me what you want.""

""This is fine."" Obi-Wan kissed him again. ""Whatever you're comfortable with.""

Anakin explored the inside of Obi-Wan's mouth for a moment before answering. ""Can I see you?""

Obi-Wan's eyebrow quirked. ""See me?"" he asked blankly.

""I want to look at you. I like looking at you.""

Obi-Wan laid back on the mattress, tilting his head. ""If you want.""

Anakin swept his gaze over Obi-Wan's body, admiring how the moonlight played over it. He followed the light dusting of hair on Obi-Wan's belly down to Obi-Wan's cock. It was thick and slightly curved. Obi-Wan's foreskin had retracted to reveal the swollen head. Anakin reached out and wrapped his hand around it, stroking lightly. It was a little strange to touch another man's cock, but he liked it. 

Obi-Wan's breath hitched. He propped himself up one elbow, breathing heavily, reaching up to stroke Anakin's face with his free hand.  Anakin kept stroking, running his thumb along the underside of Obi-Wan's cock, tracing the vein. This was so very different from Padme, and yet, it felt just the same in some ways.

Obi-Wan's eyes fluttered, his fingers stilling on Anakin's cheek. ""I'm going to come very soon if you keep doing that, Anakin,"" he whispered, his voice labored.

Anakin leaned forward and kissed Obi-Wan, his hand still on Obi-Wan's cock. ""Did you want me to stop?""

Obi-Wan kissed back, his lip movements sloppy. He ran his fingers through Anakin's hair, panting a little. ""Not really. I'm just... you might want to stop...""

""No, I don't,"" Anakin said with a smile, tightening his grip a little. He squeezed the head of Obi-Wan's cock. ""I want you to come.""

""Ah!"" Obi-Wan bucked a little and smiled up at Anakin. ""I'd say you're heading in the right direction,"" he murmured, kissing Anakin again, rather fiercely.

Anakin kissed back with equal ferocity, his hand never stilling. He brushed his fingers over the head of Obi-Wan's cock, and played with the foreskin. He also cradled Obi-Wan's balls, liking the weight of them.

Obi-Wan fell back against the mattress, his head arched back to reveal his pale throat, stark against the dark bristles on his bearded chin. ""I... Anakin,"" he gurgled, suddenly reaching down to seize the head of his cock as he came, his body spasming.

Anakin felt Obi-Wan's warm come splatter on his belly, and it felt good. He kept stroking Obi-Wan until he finished, loving the look of pleasure on Obi-Wan's face.   Obi-Wan shuddered one last time and lay still, staring up at Anakin, trying to catch his breath. He sat up after a moment, wiping his sticky fingers off on the sheets before running them over Anakin's face as he kissed him again.

Anakin returned the kiss and nuzzled Obi-Wan's face. ""Have fun?"" he whispered.

""Yes,"" Obi-Wan whispered, pulling back to kiss Anakin's neck. ""Now it's your turn.""

""Hmm?"" Anakin said, raising an eyebrow. He had a feeling Obi-Wan had something planned.

Obi-Wan smiled, rolling them over to press Anakin against the mattress. ""Just lie still. I've wanted to do this for a long time."" He kissed Anakin one last time, then slid down his body.

Anakin was beginning to get an idea of what Obi-Wan was planning, and it aroused him even more than he had been before. On top of that, Obi-Wan had said he had been wanting this for a long time. Anakin gave a pleasurable shiver at the thought.

Obi-Wan stopped at Anakin's hips, gently stroking Anakin's cock once, holding it up so he could gently lick the head of it.  Anakin whimpered. Padme had done this to him often, but it was so much more erotic with Obi-Wan. It was only through force of will that he didn't buck into Obi-Wan's mouth.  Obi-Wan delicately explored Anakin's cock with his tongue, tracing the wrinkles of flesh, veins on the underside, the slit at the tip of Anakin's cock. Just when Anakin thought he could take no more, Obi-Wan fit most of Anakin's length into his warm mouth and sucked.

Anakin groaned and clutched at the sheets. ""Obi-Wan,"" he panted, ""cl-close...""

Obi-Wan bent over Anakin, gripping Anakin's hips as if they were hand-holds, sucking harder than Anakin could recall anyone ever sucking on him, encouraging him to come with a press of his tongue along the underside of Anakin's cock.  Unable to hold out any longer, Anakin came with a yell, his orgasm intense. He could feel Obi-Wan swallowing around him, feeding into the wave of pleasure that overwhelmed him. Obi-Wan sucked on him until he was done, then patiently licked him clean, massaging Anakin's hips.

Obi-Wan sat up, tossing his head back, his hair sliding across his face.  ""All right?"" he asked with a rather smug smile.

Unable to speak, Anakin pulled Obi-Wan forward for a lingering kiss. He felt utterly limp and content. Obi-Wan kissed back, sliding up to move next to Anakin again. he was far more relaxed than before, even hooking his leg around Anakin's. He ran a hand down Anakin's cheek to his neck, then slid down to stroke Anakin's chest.

""That was nice,"" Obi-Wan whispered when he came up for air, his eyes bright in the darkness of the room.

""That was wonderful,"" Anakin corrected. He ran his hands over Obi-Wan's back. ""You're good it.""

Obi-Wan settled back, pulling himself up to rest his head on the pillows, dragging Anakin up with him. He held Anakin close, burying his face in his hair, breathing deeply. ""I told you. I've wanted to do it for a long time,"" he said quietly, pressing his cheek against the top of Anakin's head. ""It <i>was</i> wonderful.""

Anakin pressed Obi-Wan against him, not needing words to express himself. They drifted off to sleep together, holding each other tightly, happier than they'd been in years.

Luke scratched at his new Padawan braid. He wasn't sure why Daddy had changed his mind about letting him and Leia become Padawans, but he thought it might have something to do with Daddy and Ben kissing. They'd been doing it for months now, though, of course, they weren't kissing now.  They were both were sitting on a blanket farther up the beach with Mommy, deep in conversation.

It was a bright, sunny day, with no clouds in the blue sky.  Luke felt warm and peaceful standing in the sun, watching Mommy and Daddy and Ben, soaking up their joy through the Force.  There were still many times when Daddy was sad and guilty, and people still argued, but it didn't seem as often. Luke wasn't sure what the three of them did at night when locked away in Daddy's bedroom, but it seemed to make them all happier.  He could sense the changes between them, how they'd all connected.

Something wet hit the back of his neck and Luke whirled around to see Leia giggling. ""Hey!""

Leia had fistfuls of wet sand, grinning at Luke from the water's edge. Her braided hair was soaked, almost looking black, and her eyes sparkled. She seemed a little more peaceful since Master Yoda had started training her, though she was still a pain. Luke was rather happy he got Ben to train him; Ben was much nicer and easier to understand.

""Why you staring at Mommy and Daddy and Ben?"" she asked. ""They're just gonna all start kissing and being <i>boring</i> again!""

""Kissing is icky,"" Luke agreed. He thought about throwing sand at Leia and decided it would be better if he went in the water. She couldn't get him with sand there. ""But sisters are ickier!"" He dashed for the water before Leia could throw more sand.

""You take that back!"" Leia screeched, running after him. Though she was smaller, she managed to get the best of him, grabbing his arm and kissing him wetly on the cheek. ""Ha! I win!""

""EW!"" Luke yelled, scrubbing at his cheek. ""That's gross!""  He really couldn't understand why Daddy would want to kiss Mommy and Ben. Grown-ups were <i>weird</i>.

""Luke! Leia! Come inside now. We're going to have dinner,"" called Mommy, standing up from the blanket. She brushed sand off her green skirts, flicking some of it Ben's face as he looked up at her. He laughed and brushed it off, smiling brightly. He turned back to Daddy, speaking quietly.

Leia let Luke go and ran forward, pausing once she left the water.  She tugged on the straps of her white bathing suit. ""C'mon, Luke! What are you waiting for?"" she asked.

""For you to get out of the way, monkey face!"" Luke ran past Leia, sticking his tongue out. He wanted to be the first one to the house so he could sit between Ben and Daddy at dinner. They smiled at each other a lot more now, and it made him happy. 

Luke wasn't always sure what Mommy and Daddy and Ben were doing, but he knew it was a good thing.

<lj-cut text=""Everyone was leaving Anakin, it seemed."">
Everyone was leaving Anakin, it seemed.

Obi-Wan had taken the twins back to the Jedi compound to train with Yoda yesterday evening, which had given Anakin and Padme time to be alone.  Though he missed his children, spending time alone with his wife had been reinvigorating.  She reminded him why he'd turned away from the dark side, and why he continued to live, even though it hurt so much.

It was mid-morning, the sun perched in a perfectly blue sky.  A light wind ruffled the sands on the beach outside Anakin's house, the distant cries of gulls floating in the open window of his white bedroom.  Padme was packing to leave, muttering to herself as she fluttered about the room, lifting up their baubles for her jewelry or rummaging though drawers in the nonak-wood dressers.  Anakin tried to help, with mixed results. He had learned about the intricacies of her wardrobe over the years, but he was no handmaiden.

""Are you sure you're all right with this?""

Padme paused, then reached over to take her bodice out of Anakin's hands and slip it properly into the bag. She smiled at him. ""I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not stupid. I knew you loved Obi-Wan from the moment I met you again -- you were trying too hard to get both our attention. But I... I can't be with you all the time. Neither can he. We already share you. I just... I just don't want this to get weird. Weirder. Besides, Anakin, you have to realize he might not want to. He probably won't want to.""

""I promise this won't be strange. Neither of you tends toward jealousy, and I know you are both very different."" Anakin paused and looked down, his face half-shadowed. ""If he doesn't want to, I won't press. I don't have the right.""

""Expressing romantic interest in him isn't going to fix anything between you. It's going to take more than that, Anakin. You know that.""

""I know. I'm just not sure where to start. I hurt him so much.""

Padme stroked his face, smiling softly. ""Just, whatever you do, mean it. Insincerity or even trying to make up for what you did won't work with him. He's moved past it as much as he's able.""

""I do mean everything I do. He doesn't believe me."" Anakin kissed Padme's hand. ""Do you really think he's moved on?""

""I think so. It's been four years, and most of those he's spent helping you. I think he's just -- oh, Anakin, I knew about him the whole time, but he never knew about <i>me</i>.""

""I didn't mean to hurt him. I was afraid of what he would do. He could have destroyed us."" Anakin exhaled, looking at the carpeted floor. ""Like I almost did.""

Padme shook her head. ""Your problem was that you didn't fully trust him. And he fully trusted you. Now, that has reversed. And with good cause.""

Anakin nodded. ""He needs to see he can trust me. How can I show him that?""

""I... don't know that you can. Not like that. What trust he will give you, you've already earned."" Padme squeezed Anakin's hands, her brown eyes bright in the sunlight. ""Just... be yourself, Anakin. Don't try so hard.""

Anakin squeezed back, then took his wife in his arms. She always knew what to do and say, even when he didn't.

Padme wrapped her arms around him. ""I'll try to talk to Obi-Wan. I'm just going to let him know my side. I just want for all of us to be happy, that's all. Together.""

""Thank you,"" Anakin whispered. ""For everything. I love you.""

Padme rested her face against his chest, and Anakin could see her still smiling when looked down at her. ""I love you, too, Anakin. I don't know what I'd do without you. I'm so glad you came back to me.""

""I'm glad, too. I prefer loving you like this."" He didn't need to mention the alternate; Padme had suffered it more that he had.

Padme looked up at him. ""I'd like all three of us to be happy, at least a little."" She kissed Anakin's fingers.

""So would I,"" Anakin said, leaning down to kiss her. They stood like that for a moment before noises at the front door told them that Obi-Wan had arrived with the twins. ""Looks like we'd better hurry.""

Padme smiled and grabbed a couple of her bags, while Anakin picked up the rest. He nearly threw out his back and couldn't recall such a workout in recent memory, but he managed to stumble out into the hall after Padme, who walked with her usual grace and composure.  The narrow hallway gave way to the small sitting room, where Anakin took a moment to catch his breath, wondering if Padme had stuffed a bantha in her bags.

The twins seized on her the moment they appeared. ""Mama!"" they cried in unison, running over to her.  They buried their faces in her thick yellow skirts as Padme dropepd her bags and bent down to hug them.

Anakin took a moment to set down a few of Padme's bags before looking up. Obi-Wan was standing in the doorway, eyes firmly fixed in the middle distance.  He shifted his gaze to the twins. ""Were you good for Master Yoda?"" he asked.

""I was,"" piped up Luke, as Padme picked him up her arms. She and Luke had bonded more closely than Anakin had ever expected, being similar in temperament. ""Leia wasn't.""

Leia glared at her brother, then let go of her mother and ran straight for Obi-Wan, who gently picked her up. She started sobbing into his shoulder, and he stroked her braided hair, his beard twitching.

Anakin wasn't sure whether to be amused at the twins' antics or miffed that he had been ignored. ""What happened?"" He directed the question at Obi-Wan, even if he didn't make eye contact.

Obi-Wan looked over at Padme as he answered. ""Leia decided she didn't need to listen to Master Yoda. She refused to meditate or study and shouted at him when he told her to calm down. He ignored her, so she became even angrier, and tried to throw something at him. He floated her up to the rafters, and she had to sit up there all day. I think she's learned her lesson about anger and violence now.""

""I just wanted to play with my training saber,"" sobbed Leia, clutching Obi-Wan's beige robes with her chubby little fists, shaking.

""Leia, you need to be patient. I'm sure if you had done what Yoda asked, he would have let you play."" Anakin tried to ignore the irony of giving this advice, his tone heavy. ""Bad things happen when you take what you want.""

Obi-Wan glanced over at Anakin, his expression now very serious. When Anakin met his gaze, he looked away, stroking Leia's hair. She gulped a bit, peeking at Anakin from Obi-Wan's shoulder, watching him thoughtfully, trailing her small fingers through Obi-Wan's beard now.

Anakin stepped closer to Obi-Wan, eyes focused on Leia. ""Leia, sweetie, people listen to you better if you ask nicely. Hurting people never makes anything better. Your daddy learned that the hard way.""

She watched Anakin with very large brown eyes, then hid her face. ""I don't like the rafters,"" she whined.

Obi-Wan kept his gaze on Leia, silent and sorrowful. Padme walked up, smiling over at Obi-Wan and patting her daughter on the back. ""It'll be all right. You'll learn, darling.""

Anakin stroked Leia's hair, his hand covering almost her entire head. ""If you're good, you won't have to go up there any more.""

Leia looked up at Obi-Wan, petting his beard again, her eyes very wide. It was almost like they held some sort of silent conversation, for Obi-Wan nodded at her and then she turned and held her arms out for Anakin to take her.

Anakin wrapped his arms around her, cradling her. ""You're a good girl, I know it,"" he whispered.  He looked up at Obi-Wan and thanked him silently. ""Do you want to go say goodbye to Mama?""

Leia kissed Anakin wetly on the cheek and then nodded silently. Padme handed Luke to Obi-Wan and took Leia in her arms, crushing her tightly and kissing her on the forehead. Leia giggled.  Anakin leaned over to kiss Padme, trapping Leia between them. She giggled more.

""Will you be all right at the spaceport?"" asked Anakin. ""I can watch the twins while Obi-Wan drops you off.""

Padme cast a thoughtful glance at Obi-Wan. ""That's a good idea. Luke, Leia, give Mommy kisses good-bye."" She set Leia down and took turns smothering Luke and Leia in affection that they were still young enough to fully appreciate.

Luke sniffled a little bit when she pulled back. ""When are you coming back, Mommy?""

""A month at the latest. Don't worry, sweetie. I promise I'll come back."" Padme kissed both Luke and Leia again, then picked up her bags, standing up to kiss Anakin.  When they were done, Obi-Wan took Padme's bags from Anakin without meeting his eyes.

""Mast- Obi-Wan, can we talk later?"" Anakin wasn't going to let this fester, like he had so many other things. ""We need to continue our conversation from the other night.""

Obi-Wan stared at Anakin's collar, rather than Anakin's face. He took a deep breath. ""I'll come back with a few supplies,"" was all he said, his voice clipped. He headed out the door. Padme glanced at Anakin, mouthing an ""I love you"" before following out, blowing kisses at the twins.

Anakin returned Padme's gesture before looking at his children. ""What do you two want for lunch?""

They looked at each other and burst into tears.  Anakin sighed.  This was going to be a long day.

<center>~~~~~~</center>

Obi-Wan returned that evening, after dinner, the whirring noise of a speeder engine announcing his arrival. The twins were watching one of their HoloNet shows in the sitting room, talking to each other in their secret language.  They both lay on their stomachs, passing sweets from the box Anakin had given them to each other, their legs sticking up into the air.  Anakin smiled at them and walked out the kitchen door into the cool night air.

The moon was high in the sky, and the ocean lapped calmly at the shore. Obi-Wan pulled out a few boxes and crates from the back of the speeder, sweat dripping down his face.  Anakin walked over to the speeder and silently began helping Obi-Wan with the boxes. It was the least he could do now, and he enjoyed it. It was <i>normal</i>.

Obi-Wan looked in his direction, though he still avoided meeting Anakin's eyes. He carried what he had of the boxes and crates to the kitchen door without a single word. The wind ruffled his hair, the strands of gray gleaming silver in the moonlight.  Anakin brought his own boxes over and maneuvered everything so he could open the door for both of them. He walked into the brightly-lit kitchen and set his things down, waiting for Obi-Wan, wondering if talking to Obi-Wan tonight was going to be as difficult as it seemed.  Obi-Wan walked in and set the boxes and crates down. He didn't say anything, but he unloaded them, peering around the counters to see the twins in the sitting room, wrapped up in their show and each other.

Anakin set his boxes on the kitchen table and began unpacking. ""Did you talk to Padme?"" he asked softly.

Obi-Wan paused for a moment, then resumed storing boxes of food in Anakin's cupboards. ""I did,"" he said carefully.

""Then you understand,"" Anakin said. ""She knows. She doesn't mind.""

""Doesn't mind <i>what?</i>"" Obi-Wan spun on Anakin, a box of pasta still in his hand. ""Anakin, this is insane.""

""Why?"" Anakin asked. ""What's wrong with it?""

Obi-Wan's voice rose with each word he spoke. ""I don't know what crazy delusions you've got in your --""

""Ben?""

Obi-Wan froze, and Anakin looked past him to see Luke standing in the doorway to the kitchen, staring at them with wide blue eyes. They sparkled with what Anakin realized were tears.

""Please don't fight.""

Leia barreled past Luke and right to Obi-Wan's legs, wrapping herself around him. ""Don't be mad, Ben. Please don't leave. I'll be a good girl,"" she said, her high-pitched voice muffled by his pants.

Obi-Wan picked her up, glaring at Anakin before reaching out to ruffle Luke's hair. ""I'm not mad at either of you. Come along. Let's get you both to bed. It's late.""

Anakin reached down and picked Luke up, following Obi-Wan's lead to the twins' bedroom. He spent the trip whispering reassurances to Luke and stroking his back.  Luke made a wordless noise, settling comfortably in Anakin's arms, his small fingers winding in Anakin's long blond hair.  Once they reached the twins' room, the long process of getting Luke and Leia to sleep began. It took two stories from Obi-Wan and one from Anakin before the twins fell asleep.  Somehow, Anakin and Obi-Wan did this without looking at each other.

Anakin left the room before Obi-Wan did and waiting for him in the hallway. He didn't waste time when Obi-Wan walked out, the bedroom door sliding closed behind him with a soft hiss.

""I think you were in the middle of calling me delusional?""

""Let's at least have this conversation outside, where your children can't hear us and think we're speaking of them.""

Obi-Wan brushed past Anakin and walked out of the house, his steps sharp and quick. Outside, the night breeze ruffled both his and Anakin's hair, bringing the smell of salt and the ocean. The waves gently washed onto the shore, a rhythmic crashing sound that was half-disconcerting and half-soothing to a desert rat like Anakin.

Obi-Wan didn't stop by the small garden Padme had insisted Anakin build outside the house, nor even by his speeder. He walked all the way to the water, taking off his boots as he walked, leaving them abandoned in the sand. His footprints quickly filled with water, foot-shaped indentations stretching across the beach until he finally reached the water's edge.  He didn't stop until he was ankle-deep and the bottom of his pants was soaked. He seemed to relax a little then.  The moonlight glistened off the waves and his hair, making him seem like a young man.

Anakin took off his boots, but he didn't go any closer than the water's edge. While he could swim, and did, he preferred to stay out of the water unless he had to. Of course, the twins tended to insist he swim with them, but that was different.  That was for <i>them</i>.

Obi-Wan half-turned to face Anakin, his profile silver in the moonlight. ""It's not as simple as you want it to be,"" he said, his voice surprisingly clear, but under control now.

""How so?"" Anakin asked. He didn't understand what was so difficult for Obi-Wan to grasp.

""You just want me to forgive you, and you think by trying to convince me to be your lover, that everything that tore us apart would magically disappear. It doesn't work like that.""

That hurt. Anakin knew he deserved it, but it still caused his chest to ache. ""No, that's not it."" Anakin swallowed hard, trying to find the words to explain. ""I want you as a lover because I love you. Whether you forgive me is your business."" It hurt even more to say that, but Anakin had realized that he couldn't, and wouldn't, make Obi-Wan do anything, and so he had to live with whatever decision Obi-Wan came to. He looked up at the stars. They always had been the steadiest things in his life. ""I want to fix us, but I know that will take time.""

Obi-Wan's eyes were surprisingly bright, and Anakin remember how much Obi-Wan had always seemed at home by the water, at night, in the breeze. ""Why do you think that would fix us, Anakin? What makes you even think it would work? That I would even want it? That <i>you</i> would really want it?""

""I do want this. And you might. I know you want me, if nothing else."" He paused, running his tongue along the inside of his lips. ""I don't think this alone will fix us, but it's a start. It's more than what we've been doing.""

""<i>Want</i> you -- Anakin. You were my <i>apprentice</i>. My charge, my ward, and later my partner. We are -- were -- Jedi. Whatever being a Jedi means now, which isn't the same.  Any feelings we might have possessed, individually or together, had to be kept under control.""

""And now? You said you loved me. I could see that you didn't mean platonically.  I'm not <i>stupid</i>.""

Obi-Wan hung his head, turning away from Anakin. ""That was my shame, my weakness. You needn't try to placate me about it. Nor do you need to put yourself in a position to jeopardize not only your marriage, but all the work we've done to bring you to this point by starting a relationship you personally have no interest in.""

Anakin waded into the surf and put his arms around Obi-Wan. ""I'm not lying. I do want this. I am interested."" He clasped his hands in Obi-Wan's tunic, determined to hold him close as long as he could.

Obi-Wan tensed, but didn't pull away. He turned to look at Anakin, eyes still luminous. ""Anakin, I do love you. I can say that now. But this is not even a start at fixing anything. It's a start of something else -- of a relationship we never had before.""

Anakin nodded. ""I understand. If you want to wait until we've fixed things..."" He spoke slowly, rubbing Obi-Wan's shoulders, trying to help him relax.  He would prefer a healthy friendship with Obi-Wan to all the sex in the galaxy, but he wasn't sure if that was even possible.

""I thought we already had. As much as we could.""

Anakin hung his head. It was perfectly fair for Obi-Wan to say that, as much as Anakin wished it weren't true. ""I suppose we have.""

""I don't want to destroy the progress you've made. There are more things to consider than just you and me.""

""I'm not going to go back to what I was. I have too much to lose. And I don't want to be anything but honest with you.""

Obi-Wan was quiet for a long time, staring at Anakin's chin, rather than him. His voice was soft when he finally spoke. ""Padme said we'd always shared you."" It wasn't a question, but there seemed to be one behind it.

""You did. I always loved you. I was afraid to tell you, though. I could tell Padme, but I didn't think you would understand.""

""And you think it would be so easy now? That we would all get along perfectly? That changing everything we've become accustomed to -- again -- would never cause jealousy or confusion between the three of us?"" Obi-Wan's lips were very close now, his warm breath washing over Anakin's chin as the cool water swirled around their ankles.  ""Anakin, you didn't even like me visiting her as a friend.""

""Now we can tell the truth. We don't have to hide from each other. We all know what's happening. And I love you both equally."" Anakin didn't dare move, afraid of spooking Obi-Wan.

""You're not the man you used to be, but I wonder if you're the man I thought you were.""

Anakin didn't know how to answer that. He wasn't sure who Obi-Wan had thought he was, and how that differed from who he had been. He didn't know anything anymore, beyond that he loved is family: Padme, Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan.

Anakin felt something soft trailing over his cheekbones and started when he realized it was Obi-Wan's finger. ""We could... start something new...."" whispered Obi-Wan.

""Yes,"" Anakin breathed, leaning forward. He pressed his lips to Obi-Wan's. The moment stretched forever, perfect and sweet.

<b>Author:</b>  <lj user=""sky_walking"">
<b>Rating:</b>  PG  (Will be NC-17 by final part.)
<b>Pairing:</b>  Anakin/Obi-Wan (There is Anakin/Padme in here, but it's supportive.)
<b>Summary:</b>  In this galaxy, Anakin defeated Obi-Wan at Mustafar, but turned away from the dark side four years ago to save his children.  Though reconciled with his wife and trying to recover from the madness of the dark side, his relationship with Obi-Wan remains strained and unresolved.  Can they become friends again or perhaps something more?
<b>Warnings:</b>  Post-RotS AU, Slash
<b>Disclaimer:</b>  Star Wars belongs to George Lucas. We're not affiliated with him, just having fun with his Jedi.
<b>Notes:</b>  Please see <a href=""http://sky-walking.livejournal.com/768.html"">Part One</a> for full notes.  For <lj user=""brynneeryn"">.  The story kinda grew <i>again</i> and will probably now take four parts to complete.  The boys are being difficult, but the next two parts will be more slash-focused, we promise.  We will try to have Part Three by next week.  This part is a little over 3300 words.

<lj-cut text=""Anakin awoke slowly, surprised to find himself in his own bed."">
Anakin awoke slowly, surprised to find himself in his own bed. Obi-Wan must have carried him there, since Anakin could remember nothing after he had fallen to the floor. Anakin struggled to sit up, knowing he'd had another blank period -- one of his semi-catatonic reactions to overwhelming stress. He hadn't had one in almost two years, but that was probably because there was little on Agran to trigger one.  Anakin had slowly started to come to terms with everything he had done, but he didn't think he would ever stop feeling empty and guilty. Obi-Wan's words had just made it all worse.  Anakin lay flat, closing his eyes and trying not to remember the look of pain on Obi-Wan's face.

There was a small sound, and Anakin felt Luke's presence enter the room. 

""Daddy?""

Anakin stirred, his eyes fluttering open to see his round-faced young son. ""Yes, Luke?""

Luke smiled, peering into his face, blue eyes sparkling in concern. Behind him stood Leia, clutching her brother's shirt as she tried to look over his shoulder at Anakin.  She was chewing on her bottom lip.

""Are you okay, Daddy?"" whispered Luke, stroking Anakin's face.

Anakin didn't want to lie to Luke, but the truth would only worry him. ""I'm better now,"" Anakin said, shading the truth a little. ""Where's Obi-Wan?""

""Ben is talking to Mommy on the holocomm,"" whispered Leia, poking at Anakin's hand as if he were some sort of strange animal. ""We're not supposed to be in here."" This last statement seemed directed at Luke.

Luke, however, only settled himself next to Anakin, chubby fingers still on Anakin's cheek. ""Daddy is sick. And he's our Daddy. We can see him if we want to. Ben won't do nuthin'.""

""He'll be mad, and he won't cut your crusts off anymore, and I'll bet he won't like you anymore.""

Luke's lip trembled, but he laid his head down on Anakin's chest. ""He'll still like me,"" he asserted, though he didn't sound very sure of himself.

Anakin shifted and lifted Luke onto the bed with him, taking the opportunity to hold Luke close. Just having the twins nearby made him feel better. They were a reminder that <i>something</i> good had come from him. He was always a little in awe of the fact that he had help create such amazing people.

""I'll tell Obi-Wan it's all right,"" he reassured the twins. ""I promise he'll still like you.""

Leia held his hand, staring at him wide-eyed. ""Good, 'cause I like Ben. He is nice and has pretty eyes.""

""I have pretty eyes,"" said Luke sullenly, settling comfortably on Anakin's lap and wrapping his small arms around him.  He glared over at Leia, looking slightly jealous.

""Yours are boring.""

""Are not!""

""Are too!""

""Not!""

""Too!""

""Stop it!"" Anakin said. ""You both have beautiful eyes."" As far as he was concerned, his children were the most beautiful children in the galaxy. Not that he disagreed with Leia's assessment of Obi-Wan's eyes -- Anakin had always liked them. It hurt him that he almost never saw them now, and when he did, they were usually filled with pain. Another crime he had to answer for.

""Don't be mad, Daddy,"" said Leia, her bottom lip pushing out. ""I can tell you something happy: I learned how to braid hair. One of the ladies taught me. She made me a Paddy-wan's braid, but Ben took it out. He doesn't like her, I don't think. She tried to kiss him once, and he got all funny.""

""He won't let me have a Paddy-wan's braid, either,"" piped up Luke. ""Tell him I want a Paddy-wan's braid. And a new hydrospanner. Leia broke the one I had.""

""Did not!""

""Did too!""

""Not!""

""Too!""

""Luke. Leia. No fighting."" Anakin massaged his temple, wondering how they could bicker so much. ""You're both too young for Padawan braids, but you can braid my hair, Leia. And I'll get you a new hydrospanner, Luke.""

Leia pouted. ""Too,"" she whispered, pinching Luke's leg. Luke shoved at her until Anakin glared at them. They both froze and then hugged each other, smiling beatifically.

""I thought I told you two not to come in here,"" came Obi-Wan's voice. When Anakin looked up, he was standing in the doorway with his arms crossed. He wore his familiar Jedi tunics and trousers, along with the equally familiar scowl that he'd often used on Anakin when he'd disobeyed Obi-Wan as a boy.

Luke and Leia looked expectantly at Anakin, clearly waiting for him to save them.

""It's all right,"" Anakin told Obi-Wan. ""I don't mind them being here."" He ruffled Luke's hair. ""They wanted to check on me.""

Anakin paused. ""Thank you for taking care of me last night."" His voice was quiet and grave, and he couldn't look Obi-Wan in the eye and see the hurt he knew was there. He was almost sure Obi-Wan would think his relapse purposeful.

""Luke, Leia, your breakfast is ready. Go eat, and then you can play. Tell your father good-bye.""

""Bye, Daddy,"" they both said, almost at the same time. They glumly trooped past Obi-Wan, pushing against his legs. Leia paused, tugging on Obi-Wan's sleeve until he patted her on the back.  She skipped away, obviously validated by his affection.

After the children left, Obi-Wan fully entered the room, letting the door slide closed behind him.  ""Are you feeling all right?"" he asked, his tone slightly chilly. He walked over to Anakin and picked up his wrist, obviously checking his pulse.

""Better now. The worst has passed."" Truly, it hadn't, but the worst of Anakin's physical symptoms were gone. It was Obi-Wan's disapproval and disappointment that still ate at Anakin.

Obi-Wan nodded, gently touching Anakin's face as he examined his eyes and checked his temperature. Anakin could feel the gentle probe of the Force through Obi-Wan's palm on his cheek. Obi-Wan withdrew quickly, not meeting Anakin's eyes now. ""Good. I'd hate to see you relapse after all the progress Yoda and I have made with you these past four years.""

""I won't. Last night was just... stressful."" Anakin looked at the floor, not feeling worthy of any of this. Obi-Wan and Yoda put so much time into him, and, yet, he was still broken. ""I hadn't realized how much you still hurt.""

""It..."" Obi-Wan went quiet, staring out of the large window over Anakin's bed. He opened it, letting the salty ocean air in. He inhaled it deeply before answering. ""I... shouldn't have said anything. Whatever the ultimate punishment for your crimes will be, it is not mine or any Jedi's decision to make. I should have relinquished my attachment long ago.""

""Your attachment to what? Your pain? Or me?"" Anakin could feel the fear building in his gut. He didn't want Obi-Wan to repudiate him. ""You have a right to be angry.""

Obi-Wan finally glanced at him, sunlight reflecting off his eyes, making it hard to read his expression. ""Of course I have a right to be angry. You betrayed me, everything I taught you, everything we believed in. You committed atrocity after atrocity, all for the sake of one woman."" Obi-Wan spoke of these things not with the anger from last night, but with a tired resignation. ""I have a right to be angry, but that is not the Jedi way. The galaxy has been -- or rather, is being -- put to rights, and that is all that matters.""

""Sometimes I wish that wasn't the Jedi way,"" Anakin said dully, staring at his hands. ""It would be easier.""

""Why do you say such things?  Do you <i>want</i> me to be angry with you, to punish you?""

Anakin's voice was barely a whisper. ""Yes.""

Obi-Wan was quiet for a long time. When he spoke, his voice was flat. ""And that's why I won't. There's no point to it, Anakin. I could to slaughter Luke, Leia, Padme, and let you burn alive, but it would never be punishment enough. And, I suspect, will never compare to the guilt that's eating you from the inside out.""

Anakin didn't say anything. There was nothing he could say. It was true, every word of it, and he had to live with it.

Obi-Wan sighed. ""I'll bring you something to eat. Padme is putting her meetings on hiatus and is returning to Agran for a couple days. She's worried about you.""

""She worries too much,"" Anakin said.

""She is your wife. She loves you. And you gave us all a reason to worry."" Obi-Wan paused, turning away. ""I'll be back in a moment."" He left the room, his footfalls a little heavier than normal.

Anakin stared at the floor a moment longer. Sometimes, he didn't understand the people around him. Padme and Obi-Wan had been so hurt by his actions, and, yet, they still stood by him. It didn't seem right. He got to his feet with a sigh and went to take a shower. Maybe the hot water would help him think.

He emerged from the shower a short while later and dressed quickly.  He was sitting on the bed again when Obi-Wan returned with a tray full of food.  ""Master, why are you helping me?"" he found himself asking before he thought better of it.

Obi-Wan set the tray down over Anakin's lap, frowning deeply. He kept his gaze fixed on Anakin's tray, making sure the fork and glass of juice were in the right spots before withdrawing. He didn't meet Anakin's gaze when he spoke.

""For the same reason that what you did hurt so much,"" he said quietly.

Anakin tried not to start at the words, but it was a near thing. He almost had to break his vow to himself not to use the Force for anything other than meditation in order to keep the tray from spilling.  Obi-Wan steadied the tray for him, using the Force before his fingers descended on the wooden frame.

""Do you mean that?"" Anakin's averted his eyes and kept his voice soft, but left his presence in the Force steady. ""I love you, too.""

Anakin stared at Obi-Wan's hands, one durasteel and covered in a brown glove, the other still flesh, the pale skin stretched across finely-shaped bones, nails perfectly manicured. It was the hand of a Lord or a Prince, not a commoner like Anakin.

Obi-Wan withdrew, his voice hard as durasteel. ""Whatever you felt for me, it obviously didn't matter. Your wife will be here by tomorrow. Try not to worry her too much -- she already has enough pressure from the Senate.""

""You mattered. She mattered.  It was everything else that didn't.""

""Anakin, it's insulting when you lie to me. I know how much Padme means to you. It's all right. I understand. You've loved her since you were a little boy.""

Anakin set aside the breakfast tray and crossed to where Obi-Wan was standing in two quick strides. He took Obi-Wan's face in his hands and kissed him, pressing lips to lips, trying to convey emotions through touch, his heart swelling inside his chest, desperate to prove himself.

""I've loved you since I was a little boy, too,"" he said after the kiss was finished, staring into Obi-Wan's bright eyes.  He would think about what this meant later.  He would tell Padme about it all when she arrived, but Anakin knew she would understand. She'd always known what Anakin felt for Obi-Wan and had given her blessing long ago. 

Obi-Wan pulled back, looking both bewildered and angry. ""Have you lost your mind?"" he demanded. ""Don't touch me like that.""

Immediately, all the boldness that had possessed Anakin dropped away. ""I'm sorry. I won't do it again. I was only trying to show you...""

Obi-Wan wiped his lips, blinking rapidly. ""Show me what? That you've gone mad? Haven't you done enough to humiliate me?"" He waved at Anakin's breakfast tray. ""Eat something."" He started to walk away, actually trembling. Anakin couldn't recall a single instance where Obi-Wan had ever trembled before.

""I'm not trying to humiliate you,"" Anakin said quietly. ""I do love you.""

Obi-Wan clenched his fists as the doors to Anakin's room slid open in front of him. He half-turned his face, looking as sad as he had the night before. ""You don't love me like I love you. I accepted that a long time ago. Along with everything else about you, good and bad."" The doors whispered as they shut behind Obi-Wan.

For a moment, Anakin's anger flickered and he felt an impulse to throw his breakfast across the room. He squelched the feeling and moved the tray to the bedside table. He wasn't all that hungry anyway. 

<center>~~~~~~</center>

Obi-Wan had been true to his word and left Anakin alone with the twins, which made Anakin feel simultaneously better and worse. Better, because the twins always made him feel better, and worse, because he wished he could talk to Obi-Wan, explain his feelings so Obi-Wan would understand.

It was late in the afternoon of the next day when the whine of a speeder interrupted Anakin's scrubbing of gueri juice from the sitting room carpet. The twins were down for their nap, after the incident which had resulted in the gueri juice spilling in the first place.  He couldn't hear them whispering conspiratorially in their room anymore, which probably meant they were actually asleep.

Anakin stood up, putting aside the cleaning supplies. He peeked through the white curtains of his front window. He saw Obi-Wan lifting several large bags out of the back of the speeder, and a very familiar and beautiful woman heading up the stairs, clutching her embroidered violet skirts in her delicate hands.

Anakin flung the door open and took Padme in his arms, his heart bursting in relief. It still amazed him that she let him touch her, after all that he had done. She knew how cruel he could be, but she still trusted him. ""Padme,"" he breathed, inhaling the scent of her hair.

Padme held him tightly, nuzzling her face against his cheek for a moment. She pulled back after a moment, cupping his face and staring up at him in concern. ""Are you all right, Anakin?"" she whispered.

Behind her, Obi-Wan genteelly cleared his throat, holding nearly a dozen bags that Anakin knew had to be stuffed full of clothes, jewelry, and hair accessories.  Padme had packed light for this trip.

""Now I am,"" he said. ""You're here."" He kissed her hand and pulled away, moving to help Obi-Wan with the bags. He didn't dare look at Obi-Wan, simply moving the bags into the sitting room.

Obi-Wan avoided getting to close to Anakin, setting down Padme's bags inside the door. He turned to her, ignoring Anakin entirely. ""I'll be back in a couple days, to take you back to the spaceport. Call me if you need me before then.""

Padme nodded to him, the slightest trace of a frown furrowing her brow. Obi-Wan walked out, still ignoring Anakin, heading back to the speeder. As soon as he started up the engine, Padme whirled on Anakin, the frown in full effect on her brow. ""What happened between you two? He won't tell me.""

Anakin winced. ""We... talked. He's still hurt, from before. And then yesterday, he wouldn't believe me when I said I loved him. So I kissed him. And now..."" He spread his hands in defeat.

Padme sighed, squeezing Anakin's arm. ""Anakin... we need to talk. But where are Luke and Leia? He said he'd left them with you.""

""They're napping. They spilled juice, and I put them to bed. They won't be up for another hour or so.""

She nodded and led him over to the couch. She sat down, bunching up her heavy skirts so they'd lie flat. When Anakin sat beside her, she took his hand in hers, stroking his fingers. ""Anakin, he said you went into shock. Like you used to... after..."" She sounded more than worried, she sounded afraid.

Anakin stared at their intertwined hands before looking at Padme. ""It's okay.  It was just that he was telling me how hurt he was. It brought everything back. Everything he said was true, and I felt so lost and empty...""

""Oh, Anakin."" She stroked his cheek, biting her bottom lip. ""He's spent these past four years focusing on you and the Jedi and the twins, but has left no time for himself. He'll always be hurt. You can't change that, but you can move past that. If he didn't love you so much, he wouldn't have agreed to help you.""

""I didn't see it before. He should have told me. He shouldn't be so contained."" There was genuine concern in Anakin's voice. The degree of control and selflessness Obi-Wan displayed sometimes worried him. It couldn't be good for Obi-Wan to keep everything inside like that.

""You know how he is. He's devoted his whole life to you, even now."" Padme dropped her hand, leaning back against the cushions of the couch as she studied Anakin's face. ""Why did you kiss him?"" she asked slowly.

""Because he thought I didn't love him. He thought I only loved you. I was trying to change his mind."" Anakin drew in a deep breath, hoping Padme still understood. ""I love you both."" Padme already knew this, but Anakin felt it bore repeating.

""I know, but..."" Padme licked her lips, staring out of the open window. A breeze drifted through, making the elaborate braids on top of her head tremble. ""Loving two people.  Anakin, it's a hard idea for most people to live with. Even for me.""

Anakin took her in his arms again, wanting to reassure her of how much he appreciated her for staying with him, much less loving him. ""Nothing will make me love you less. I promise.""

She wrapped her arms around him, burying her face in his shoulder. ""I know. We've always shared you, I suppose, though I don't think he consciously realized that. But even if Obi-Wan realizes you belong with him as much as me, that might not fix anything. Obi-Wan has his own demons to wrestle with.""

""I wish I knew how to help him."" Anakin felt like such a drain of everyone else.  He wanted to help, but didn't know where to start.  He didn't even know if trying to convince Obi-Wan of his feelings would help, but maybe that was a start.

""I don't know, Anakin. Obi-Wan can take care of himself. I worry about you. You shouldn't be going into shock like this. I thought we were past this.""

""It was just once. I'm fine now, I promise."" He didn't want Padme to worry about him. She had more important things to worry about.""It's not going to happen again.""

Padme pulled back, her expression dead serious. ""Anakin, Luke and Leia depend on you, now."" Her voice was as hard as durasteel. ""I love you, you know that, but if you endanger the lives of my children, you'll never see them again. We're trusting you. I know it's been hard for you, but I want you to remember who you are -- the good man I married seven years ago on Naboo.""

Anakin's heart stopped. He couldn't imagine living without Luke and Leia. He had come back from the dark side for them, and they were his reason for living. ""I will <i>never</i> hurt our children. I will die before I let anything happen to them. Even if that means hurting myself rather than letting my anger get the best of me.""

Padme bent forward, resting her forehead against his, looking into his eyes. ""I believe you. Don't go where I can't follow again,"" she whispered.

""Never again, love.""

Anakin sealed the promise with a kiss and rested his cheek against her braided hair, wondering if he could ever make Obi-Wan believe in him as much as Padme did.

<b>Notes:</b>  For <lj user=""brynneeryn""> who very kindly chose us to write her a fic for the <a href=""http://imadra-blue.livejournal.com/197908.html"">Star Wars Secret Valentine's Challenge</a>.  You asked us for a few pairings without any particular scenarios, Brynne, and we chose Anakin/Obi-Wan.  We tried to write something you'd like, but we got so carried away with this alternate universe that keeping it to a short short is impossible.  It will be a <s>three-part</s> four-part short story, and here's the first part.  We were under the impression that going over 1000 words would be okay, so we hope you don't mind.  The next <s>two</s> three parts will be along shortly; we think we can have the second part by next week.  Also, we think your lovely fic <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/ewan_hayden/570593.html"">""Happiness Sneaks In""</a> inspired a beach scene in here.  This part is a little over 3000 words.

<lj-cut text=""Anakin had often heard that good intentions paved the road to hell, but no one had any answers on what paved the road back."">
Anakin had often heard that good intentions paved the road to hell, but no one had any answers on what paved the road back.  He meditated every day, trying to find the answer in the Force instead.

Fear had driven Anakin to the dark side, and even now that he had turned away from it, fear still haunted him.  It kept him awake at night, lying on a wide marriage bed that was lonely more often than not, and even when he slept, dreams of his sins plagued him.  What little peace he found was when he was with the people he loved, but when they weren't there, he was afraid.  Afraid of himself.  Afraid of what he'd done.  Afraid he'd never be forgiven.

Shrieks and laughter startled Anakin out of his meditations.  He let his consciousness drift back into his body, where he sat on a mat inside his small house on the outskirts of the Jedi settlement on Agran.  He tried to drain as much of his negative emotions as he could into the Force.  He listened to the noises outside, finally recognizing Luke and Leia's high-pitched voices. He knew Obi-Wan had to be with them. Obi-Wan was always with them when they came to visit, supervising to make sure that nothing happened. Anakin had stopped resenting Obi-Wan for that long ago; after all that had happened, it was enough he got to see Luke and Leia at all when Padme wasn't there to watch over him.

The dark time that had followed the twins' birth four years ago blurred in Anakin's memory, but he remembered enough to appreciate the precautions that Obi-Wan and Yoda were taking with him. In fear for Padme's life, he had sworn his allegiance to Palpatine and destroyed the Jedi Temple. On Mustafar, he had defeated Obi-Wan, slicing off the older man's right arm.  Obi-Wan had cried out in pain a moment before Anakin knocked him unconscious and left him on the blackened shores of Mustafar.  Anakin had run back to find his wife, using the dark side to keep her alive while she'd given birth to their babies. In the months that had followed, he had done Palpatine's bidding, biding his time until Padme was ready to become Empress. Things had turned out nothing like he'd expected.  In the end, when Palpatine had threatened his children, Anakin had killed him and turned away from the dark side.

Anakin had emerged from the battle shattered. Physically, he was unscathed, but mentally, he was lost. He was neither Jedi nor Sith, not dark or light. All the definitions that had held him together were gone. He had been able to care for himself and his family, even recognize Padme and Obi-Wan, but anything beyond that had overwhelmed him. His entire self had been emptied.

Now, Anakin was recovering, finding pieces of himself along the way. The galaxy was healing, with Padme reforming the Senate and Obi-Wan and Yoda rebuilding the Jedi. Agran had been chosen as the retreat where the Jedi could recover, and Anakin had been brought along so that Obi-Wan and Yoda could continue the therapy they had begun with him. Padme had sent the twins along, knowing how much good they did Anakin, wishing to keep them away from the political maelstrom she dealt with. Obi-Wan and Yoda trained them as Jedi, but it was informal training, as Yoda still contemplated how the Jedi should adjust to the changes in the galaxy.

Anakin came to his feet, leaving his tiny meditation room and entering the crowded sitting room full of the Naboo wicker furniture Padme had insisted putting it.  He could hear Obi-Wan's voice, even though muffled through the wooden door. Anakin flung the door open in excitement. Obi-Wan stood just outside, hand raised to knock. He froze when he saw Anakin, and his smile faded, as if someone had shut a door on his face. Beside him, Leia held her shoes in her hands, white sand clinging to her tiny feet and pale legs as she pointed at the long beach several meters to the side of Anakin's small house. Luke sat on the step, ripping his own shoes off. He turned when Anakin opened the door, the only one to smile. The twins loved playing in the warm waters of Agran.

""Hello, Anakin,"" said Obi-Wan in the cool, unfamiliar tone he used around Anakin now. ""Your children wanted to know if they could go play in the water today."" He gestured at the beach, the tide spraying onto the shore as he spoke. Agran was an idyllic, moderate planet filled with shallow oceans, flat grasslands, and deciduous forests -- perfectly resonating in the light side of the Force. Anakin had no doubt that was why Obi-Wan and Yoda had chosen it as the Jedi Order's new home.  The planet itself had a healing nature to it.

""Of course they can,"" Anakin said, feeling the twinge that always accompanied remembering that Obi-Wan no longer fully trusted him. He didn't blame Obi-Wan, of course, but it still hurt to see him so distant.  He smiled at Luke and Leia. ""Go on. I'm right behind you."" He started to take off his boots, propping himself up in the doorway.

""Thank you, Father,"" said Leia primly, eyeing Anakin for a moment. There was so much of Padme in her face and her intricately coiled brunette hair that it made Anakin's heart ache for his beloved wife, who wouldn't be able to return for at least another month. There had been another flare-up in the Senate, and she'd left again to take care of it.  She was determined to see peace restored to the galaxy. Anakin couldn't blame her for the desire, since he'd been one of the reasons she had to work so hard to fix everything. His stomach twisted with guilt, and he looked away from Leia. Like Obi-Wan, she had a way of reminding him of his mistakes without even having to say anything.

Luke finished peeling off his shoes and grabbed Anakin's hand, his elfin face lit up with a bright smile. ""Don't take too long, Daddy,"" he said. ""Ben made us kiri sandwiches, and he cut the crusts off, too."" Luke squeezed Anakin's hand, the Force gently flowing from his fingertips, sending a soothing sensation through Anakin's body.  After a moment, Luke turned and followed his sister to the water, both shrieking as they stripped down to their bathing suits and dived into the ocean.

Obi-Wan still looked painfully neutral and bland. The smile he gave Anakin never reached his eyes. ""Your supplies should be arriving by droid transport within the hour. Until then, I brought Luke's favorite sandwiches. He wouldn't leave me in peace unless I promised to make them this morning."" He rolled his shoulder and patted a large bag he carried, presumably full of food. Anakin's gaze was drawn to Obi-Wan's right hand, remembering how he'd brought it and Obi-Wan's lightsaber before Palpatine, mistakenly thinking Obi-Wan would leave him alone. Anakin clenched his own right hand, which he still wore a black glove over, finding it ironic that he and Obi-Wan were a matched set now.

""Are you coming?"" asked Obi-Wan.  He flexed his cybernetic hand.  Though he left the skin covering on, he still wore a brown glove over it.  Anakin knew Obi-Wan hated his mechanical hand; he'd always hated Anakin's.

""Yes,"" Anakin said, rolling up his pants. He followed Obi-Wan down to the beach, murmuring an apology so quietly it was possible that only the wind heard it. He had thought to protect Obi-Wan by cutting off his arm, thinking he'd ensured that Obi-Wan wouldn't have pursued him, but it had backfired like nearly everything he had done in Palpatine's service. 

The sand was warm under Anakin's bare feet, and he was reminded of Tatooine for a moment. He looked out at the horizon, almost surprised to see one sun hanging over an ocean instead of two perched over a desert.

Obi-Wan laid out a large blue blanket and sat on it, putting the bag down. He kept a watchful eye on Luke and Leia as they splashed each other, laughing and babbling the strange language they'd invented for themselves. Anakin felt another twist, this one not so familiar. Obi-Wan had never watched him so carefully when he'd been a boy.

Anakin felt something being shoved in his hand, surprised to realize Obi-Wan had opened a satchel and was handing him a blue kiri sandwich. Obi-Wan looked away when Anakin stared into his face, the wind gently ruffling his wheat-colored hair.  It had gotten long again.

""I talked to Padme this morning when she called for the twins,"" he said, his voice as fluid as the blue-green ocean spread out before them. ""The Senate is quieting down, so she may be back here within a month. She said to tell you hello, and that she would contact you tomorrow. She's worried you're not eating enough.""

Anakin smiled slightly. Padme was always worried about him for one reason or another. Anakin appreciated it, as he appreciated everything about Padme. She had been even more hurt by him than Obi-Wan, and yet, she stayed with him. He was thankful every moment for that, and made sure she was aware of it. It was her quiet strength that had started to heal him, and it was her faith that gave him the will to recover. She was sure he was a good person even when he himself doubted it.

""I'll be looking forward to her call,"" Anakin said. He took a bit of the sandwich. ""You did tell her I was eating, right?""

Obi-Wan stared at the uneaten sandwich in his own hand. ""I told her that as far as I knew, you were. She... seemed upset with me for not keeping a closer eye on you."" A bit of sand blew across his face with the wind, and he brushed it off his cheek, as one might brush away a tear.

Anakin sat down on the blanket, but continued to watch the twins play in the water. ""I wish you would come visit more."" Anakin missed Obi-Wan and didn't know how to begin repairing what he had so foolishly destroyed.  He didn't even know how to ask.

""I thought you wouldn't want me to. Not unless I was bringing your children or Padme out here.""

Anakin swallowed with difficulty. Where had Obi-Wan gotten that idea? ""No, I want you to. I just didn't want to force you to."" Anakin would never make Obi-Wan or anyone else do something they didn't want ever again.

""You have a wife, two children... a family. Master Yoda is allowing it because he says the Jedi should change, but I don't see how there's room for anything or anyone else.""

Anakin risked a glance at Obi-Wan, his heart breaking at the thought that Obi-Wan didn't see his place in Anakin's life. ""You were my friend,"" he said softly. ""I miss you.""

Obi-Wan seemed old and sad when he met Anakin's gaze. ""I miss you, too. But I'm not sure if you're the same person. And I can't decide if that's an improvement or not.""

""I..."" Anakin didn't how to respond. He broke eye contact, staring at the fine white sand at his feet instead. ""I don't know if I'm the same person. But I'm trying to be a better person.""

""I know you are,"" whispered Obi-Wan, his gloved fingers brushing along Anakin's arm. His lips parted as if to speak again, but Luke and Leia suddenly appeared, flinging their wet bodies down on the blanket between Anakin and Obi-Wan, still giggling.

""Can I have a sandwich now, Ben?"" asked Luke. He and Leia had been unable to pronounce Obi-Wan when they'd started talking, and their pet name for him had stuck. Anakin was surprised Obi-Wan hadn't talked the twins out of it yet, but he supposed Obi-Wan was changing, too.

Obi-Wan passed sandwiches out to both Luke and Leia. He caught Anakin's eye and signaled ""later"" with a hooked finger and thumb along his jaw line, using the hand signals he and Anakin had developed for each other during the Clone Wars. It seemed appropriate as Luke and Leia babbled in their private jibberish, ripping huge bites of sandwiches off between nonsense words.  Anakin had thought their language strange, until Padme had told him twins often made up their own language; it made them feel special and close.  Anakin certainly couldn't begrudge his children that.  The code he and Obi-Wan had used to communicate with had always made him feel the same.

Obi-Wan's quiet words and gentle touch eased the gaping emptiness that haunted Anakin just the slightest bit. He wanted to connect with Obi-Wan like he had once, and they were just a little closer to that goal.  He rubbed his eyebrow in agreement with Obi-Wan's silent signal, and turned to the twins. ""Smaller bites! Your mother would be upset if she saw you eating like that.""

Luke and Leia giggled and slowed down, both now chatting to Anakin, telling him about how Master Yoda had let them play with their first training sabers the other day and how much fun they were having with the new children brought to Agran and what few Jedi had survived Order 66. Obi-Wan kept silent, letting Anakin spend time with his children. When the droid transport arrived with Anakin's supplies, Obi-Wan left them alone to unload them.

When the sun dipped low into the cerulean sky, Obi-Wan appeared and ushered them all back to Anakin's house. He insisted the twins take a bath, forcing them into dry clothing stored in their closets in their room.  They did not sleep at Anakin's house unless Padme was there with them. Anakin made a quick dinner of souri steaks and pinan, which was quickly devoured by the four of them. The twins quickly got tired after that, and Obi-Wan put them in their small beds to Anakin's surprise, rather than quickly ushering them back to the main compound. Anakin kissed them good night, grateful to have them there with them.  They brought him peace, even fiery little Leia

After they fell asleep, Anakin followed Obi-Wan to the peach-walled sitting room. The smell of the ocean drifted in through an open window, and a gentle breeze sent the curtain fluttering. Though he'd spent his formative years on a desert planet, the sounds of the ocean comforted Anakin, reminding him of his mother for some reason.  Obi-Wan said nothing shouldered his bag, glancing thoughtfully back at Anakin. There was a bit more gray in his beard, startling Anakin as it gleamed in the dim overhead lighting.

""I'm going to let them stay here with you,"" Obi-Wan finally said.

Anakin froze in shock. Obi-Wan and Yoda had always worried that he might have relapsed and hurt the children. Not that he would; he had killed Palpatine to protect them, and he would never let anything happen to them, even if the danger was from himself.

""Thank you,"" Anakin said quietly. ""They'll be fine here. You can come visit them any time.""

Obi-Wan still looked thoughtful, but hesitant. His eyes were very intent; they seemed bluer than Anakin remembered. ""I'll be back at the end of the week. I'm trusting you to take care of them."" He put a slight emphasis on the word ""trust"".

""I will. I promise."" Anakin had never been more serious in his life. He didn't want to disappoint Obi-Wan again. He had failed Obi-Wan enough for one lifetime already.

Obi-Wan nodded and turned to leave. His beard twitched, and it took Anakin a moment to realize it was because he was working his jaw. Then Obi-Wan drew his hood up, hiding his face under the dark brown cloth.

Anakin hesitated, but touched Obi-Wan's arm. ""Do you have to leave right now?""

Obi-Wan glanced down at his hand, considering it for a long moment before speaking. ""No.""

Anakin swallowed. ""We were talking earlier...""

Obi-Wan met his gaze, peering out from under his hood. ""We were. I don't know what to say to you anymore, Anakin. The whole time I thought you were with me, there was a part of you with Padme. I won't pretend I didn't know something was going on, but I never thought it was something like this."" He looked away. ""I suppose I was blind.""

""I loved you as much as I loved Padme."" The truth was as simple as that. ""When I was with her, there was a part of me with you.""

Obi-Wan held up his gloved hand. His smile was thin as a circuit wire. ""I find that a little hard to believe, given what happened on Mustafar.""

Anakin winced. ""You weren't supposed to follow me. You were supposed to give up and be safe. I needed to make it look like you died, so you could be safe."" Anakin didn't know if Obi-Wan would understand, but it was the only explanation he had.

Obi-Wan dropped his hand, his expression closing. ""Don't insult me or our friendship by trying to paint a pretty coat over <i>what you did</i>, Anakin."" For the first time since Mustafar, he sounded angry.

Anakin winced again. ""I'm sorry. I know what I did. But that was why. I wanted you safe.""

""Is that how you justify your actions?  You didn't care whether I lived or died. I was no longer important, because I was your enemy. If you're going to continue to lie, then I'm leaving.""  Obi-Wan turned away again, reaching for the doorknob.

""Dammit, if I had wanted to kill you, I would have!"" Anakin reached for him, his eyes stinging. ""Please believe me.""

Obi-Wan looked up at the ceiling, his hood falling back from his handsome face. ""How <i>could</i> you, Anakin? I don't care what you did to me, but the younglings..."" His tone hardened. ""How could you ever justify the life of one woman for all those people you killed? For betraying the Jedi? For betraying me?"" When he finally looked at Anakin, he wore the look of hurt he'd worn on Mustafar. ""I <i>loved</i> you, Anakin. You were my <i>brother</i>.""

Anakin didn't reply. He couldn't reply. Everything Obi-Wan was saying was true, and there was nothing Anakin could do about it. He had failed at everything he tried, and he had brought the galaxy down with him. Why Obi-Wan and Yoda even bothered to heal him was beyond him. Nothing mattered.

He didn't realize he had sunk to the floor until he felt the scratch of the rug under his cheek and a sharp pain in his arm.

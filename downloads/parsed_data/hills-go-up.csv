"event","so lastnight whaoooo sooo exciting josh IMd me and asked me if i wanted to do something today so we planned to go to the movies (<3) which was ironic because the day after i get my new movie pass and was saying to myself ""ya know, i'd really like to go with a guy when i use this"" and look what happened!....but due to the piles of snow that were currently getting here this whole ""date"" if thats what you wanna call it,isnt going to happen so thanks a lot snow, thanks for coming when we dont need you...but there is always another time (i hope!)

swim meet lastnight was awesome, i had a headache though when i got there and wasnt really in the mood for the loud noise and all the events i had to swim but it started to desolve as the night progressed..but all in all i did real good in all my events and i checked out the time sheets and i think i have a prety good shot at districts so im real happy about that one..hope ill make it to regionals again, but it sucks because they're at the freedom center this year instead of someplace 3 hours away, so no roadtrip this yeah *tear* but oh well, i just hope i make it! yeah awesome stuff! everybody enjoy their day off tomorrow HOPEFULLY NO SCHOOL TUESDAY YEAAAHH!!"

"event","so lastnight went to the movies to see The Butterfly Effect with darren,craig,and amelia. i would have to say that tbe (the butterfly effect) was a pretty good moveie if i might say so, there were a lot of funny parts like when evan (ashton kutcher) woke up at one point in the movie and didnt have any arms, so he was all like ""what the F is this?""..then later on he was being wheeled around in his wheelchair by this girl and they stopped to talk on a bench and she put the EMERGENCY BREAK (BAHAHAHA) on so the wheelchair wouldnt move...i just thought it was funny because i mean he didnt have any arms so where was he going to go? its not like he was gonna go wheel around himself!..so i give it like...an 8, because there were just some disturbing parts of the movie,some guy like a pediphile and a kid who wanted set a dog on fire, it was a most saddened moment. there was this part though which kind of sucked because i was for a split second zoning out then all of a sudden something happens and it caught me by surprise so i jumoed because i got ""scared"" and i cut myself on my pinky and it started bleeding so Craig gave me a gum wrapper to put around it....such a nice fellow, then when i got home i finally got to see it under the light and noticed like a huge chunk of skin was gone...so thats what i get for zoning out, i wont be doing that anymore!

welp but on the other hand, got a swim meet tonight again..this will be like the 3rd or 4th saturday in a row...but we didnt have one lastnight so at least i got a break from having 2 a weekend..so this should be fun iv been working really hard at practice so i can do really well in this meet so i can make it to districts again...then hopefully regionals again, that was a fun little roadtrip last year with mitch and everybody....oh 8'o clock tonight if ya wanna come...Freedom Center NO CHARGE haha so come and support the school you hate...OP!"

"event","alright so how come josh has to be such a deuschbag all the time? i mean i like the the kid why cant he see that? or maybe he does i mean who knows, but i mean like its so gay how he cant even sau hi to me in the hallway just gives his stupid little nod like he does to everybody, but i mean then again 9 out of 10 times hes probably stoned when he gives all those nods of his head. but i juat have a hge crush on this kid and i hate how we cant ever talk like we used to or hangout and go to chipotle's like we sometimes did. i guess this is all wishful thinking on my part, but really why cant things go back to the way they were like back in october or something? and he gets so pissed off at like everything, at least he seems to i mean weve or maybe its just me, but ""we"" have had this like on running joke about him stealing the michelle branch cd for from from sam goody and so he goes to my journal and comments on saying that he was going to steal it for me, but they were sold out so he decided to steal 2 for himself, so i mean then i go and like read his journal and he has some gay post up there, and i comment and say ohhh while your there get me the michelle branch cd because he like posted at best buy or something, so he like comes back and comments on my journal and is like just go buy the cd for chirsts sake, when i clearly stated in my comment on his that i was just kidding with him about buying it for me, because i wouldnt go ask him to spend like 13 dollars on me just for the hell of it ya know? so its like he cant take a joke or something i mean who knows..and another thing oh this post isnt for like bitching or whatever,but like he'll call me sometimes and leave a voicemail and i get my hopes like way up but really im just setting mysef up for the fall iv actually had thoughts in the back of my head that he just does it for fun or something...i know this is such a long thing about one person but iv never actually like leaked all of this stuff out until now, so its like come curse for me that i just happen to maybe have my phone off or maybe im sleeping when he calls, so its like he calls at the time when he knows im not awake or arounf my phone....im not saying its messed up or something but again, 9 out of those 10 times he s stoned or drunk or...pretty much doesnt realize whats hes doing which is a sad thing too because its like OH BOY HE CALLED ME!! then the next day i get an IM from him and then nothing more for about 2 weeks then it alll happens again it just confuses me sometimes....he did it like a few weeks ago and i really set myself up for this on, the whole next week no talking, no nothing, and that entire week i was just completely depressed because he even openly admitted the fact that he didnt mean a thing on his voicemail he left me which would seriously made me so incredibly happy if he really did, because it meant a lot to me that e had called and left a message like the one he did, then i learn he was drunk and didnt know what was going on...so yeah then like week 1/2 later when im just beginning to get over the whole ordeal it happens again but this time i was prepared and didnt get so caught up in it like i did the week before...but theres still that little tiny part of me that just wants to like go up to him in the hallway everytime i see and give him this gigantic hug and hope that everything will be ok...but that will only be a dream right? because yeah he might not know whats going on."

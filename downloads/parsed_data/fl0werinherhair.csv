"event","I can't really decide whether any of these new developments are because of fear, weariness, realism, selfishness or some deep shift in mentality.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure what effect I have on anyone anymore, or if I have any effect at all.&nbsp; I feel like I've made a point to become a blip on everybody's radar, and now all I have to do is wait for something to happen.&nbsp; I don't know what I'm waiting for.&nbsp; Maybe I'm waiting for it all to end.&nbsp; Maybe I'm waiting for something to draw me out again.&nbsp; Maybe I'm just being a self-indulgent idiot who's been too into tortured artists lately-- honestly, I can hardly tell the difference between me and my actual reactions, and me acting as I hope I'd react in some dimension where I may like who I am, or be who I want to be.&nbsp; So basically, it's all the same as it ever was.

I wish I could write.&nbsp; It's been so long, and feels so much longer than it actually is.&nbsp; But I know that if I try it will only make matters worse-- or maybe that's my problem.&nbsp; I wait for some magical source of inspiration, when really, there might be none unless you make it.&nbsp; I just need to sit down and just do it.&nbsp; But I will hate myself soon afterward.

In the real, tangible world, things are all right.&nbsp; I finished my breadth pretty much, and it felt good to take that figure drawing class, and just spend a good hour or two doing nothing but mindless mark-making.&nbsp; I think everybody was pretty shocked at how young I was (they were all over 40, most likely, if not over 50 or 60), and I think Mrs. Porco is quite upset that I asked to keep the sketches at school.&nbsp; They wouldn't survive in my house, and I'd really need them as a reference anyway.&nbsp; Blahblahblah I'm babbling senselessly.

The point is: I'm going to NY next week and need to buy some coats this weekend.&nbsp; I'm waiting for several e-mails about bake sales and Manos book bags and passport renewals.&nbsp; I'm dreading taking Austin and her friend home because I'm tired and I don't like her friend.&nbsp; I wish I could write.&nbsp; I wish I was a better artist.&nbsp; I wish I could play an instrument.&nbsp; I'm making Nutella brownies tomorrow that will be fabulous.&nbsp; Bob Dylan is my new idol and love of my life.&nbsp; I'm tired all the time, and dyed my hair yesterday.&nbsp; My phone's been dead for the last two days.&nbsp; I've gained about 10 pounds over the last 12 hours.&nbsp; This is my life."

for me at least.


Last night I had a dream that Bob Dylan was in my class, and we sat next to each other.&nbsp; When I'd turn my head, he'd scream right next to my ear.&nbsp; He'd also sing in his chair, and he made me laugh.&nbsp; I walked away for some reason, right when we were being split into groups.&nbsp; I wanted to be grouped with him, but by the time I got back, he'd already paired up with Michael Bugter.&nbsp; So I went over and made a group of three with Kristen Graham.


I've had weird fits and weird moods and weird dry spells all over the place, and sometimes I feel like a middle-aged soccer mom.

-whether or not you will be returning to my house afterwards and/or sleeping over
-whether or not you will be going to the beach the following morning

I need all this information because I need to know if we should reserve seating at the theater, or if I should clear my living room for mattresses, or get extra food, or figure out car-pooling (let's reduce those carbon emissions!).&nbsp; I'd rather not leave all that to the last minute, SO, I am requesting that at some point THIS WEEK, everyone who was invited could comment and/or call/text me (954-243-1676) regarding all that was mentioned above.&nbsp; Don't hesitate to ask me any questions, too.

ALSO:

I don't know if this was made clear enough, BUT YOU NEED TO DRESS UP IN RHPS GARB.&nbsp; Meaning, you can either be Brad, Janet, Frankie, Eddie, Riff Raff, Magenta, Columbia, Dr. Scott, Rocky, a random Time-Warper, or any form of the floor-show costumes.&nbsp; If you haven't seen the movie and are lost as to how you should dress up or who you should dress up as, just call me and I'll help ya out.&nbsp; I don't think most of you will have trouble, though.

So I went shopping for myself for the first time in a long time.&nbsp; I'm an indie slut!&nbsp; 
I can't fucking finish my shelf portrait.&nbsp; It's fucking frustrating.&nbsp; I can't think of anything to represent me that I haven't already put there, or doesn't make me sneer.&nbsp; Damn me for making a huge fucking shelf.&nbsp; Damn me for getting sick of everything every 2 seconds.&nbsp; But hey, I'm really proud of myself for this Sioux man I'm doing in pen and ink.&nbsp; I love my art classes!&nbsp; But I wanna get some soy cream for that coffee...even though that hazelnut shit is yummyyyyyyyy.
I started filling out applications.&nbsp; I need to see the BRACE guy.&nbsp; I'm SO EXCITED for college, and it's a year away.&nbsp; But damn.&nbsp; 
Austin is stressing out and I worry about her, and I want to be reassuring and helpful, but I seem to only stress her out more.&nbsp; 
My mom and Arjun got back together.&nbsp; I think my mom sort of grew up a little in the last 6 weeks, and I really like her more for it.&nbsp; We had a long talk and it was nice to be able to do that with her again.&nbsp; I told her the silly things you want to tell your mom about, and she listened and it was calming and reassuring.&nbsp; 
I'm thinking more and more lately that maybe I don't need a therapist anymore...I mean, it used to be that I was so happy going and it really made me feel more sane, but lately it just seems gratuitous and superfluous and useless and some more s's.&nbsp; Plus, I'm making my mom spend an extra $200 a month, and that's not fair and not right if I feel like I'm not progressing at all within it.
But anyway, life is happy!&nbsp; Of course, there's stressing stuff and troubling stuff and struggling, but...I dunno, it's nothing really mind bogglingly terrifying.&nbsp; Or maybe I'm just a selfish bitch who doesn't really care about other peoples misfortunes...

A milestone of my life occured today.&nbsp; I plucked my eyebrows.&nbsp; Thoroughly.&nbsp; Actually, I got Austin to do it for me, because she's an eyebrow artist.&nbsp; Now I actually look like a girl, and not so ugly when I have my glasses off.

My dad killed a wasp that had been living in my room today and for some reason, I got really upset and almost cried.

Behold : the mundanity of my existence. 

edit:&nbsp; OK, I'm not done.

I've been really restless this weekend.&nbsp; I think I know why, but the reasoning doesn't keep the inevitable ruminating from happening, so I started to think about why I had absolutely nothing to do this weekend, and why that felt so awful.&nbsp; Basically, the conclusion I reached was that I need to move on from all the feelings I always end up feeling in these situations - the anger and hopelessness and worthlessness and loneliness - and fucking start to be proactive - but in different respects.&nbsp; I mean, I have been trying a little harder, but maybe it's on already lost causes.&nbsp; The thing is, I've been missing what's pretty fucking obvious for a while now, and as much as I'd like to cling to the idea that I was right and everybody else is an asshole, that's simply not true.&nbsp; 
See, I like all of you.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; But I can't take a hint, and I can't see passed myself most of the time.&nbsp; It's something I have to work on.&nbsp; In the meantime, though, I figure I should accept what's already happened and quit fighting against what's really perfectly logical and understandable.&nbsp; It took a few people to tell me what was going on, though.&nbsp; A few people on several different occasions, actually.&nbsp; But hey, better late then never, right?
...right?
Now it's just the issue of finding some way to fill up my weekends.&nbsp; Without the self-loathing and pitifulness, I don't know what I'll do with myself!

That means something.&nbsp; Of course it goes beyond that, though, like those moments where there may be total understanding between us, and those are glorious moments, but I feel like they take too long to get to.&nbsp; And then on the other hand I feel as though that is a necessity, because if we were as close as we could be, we'd get so frustrated with each other that we'd flake apart like so many of my relationships do.&nbsp; You mean a lot to me, though.&nbsp; I'd like to think I mean a lot to you, too, but maybe you're too analytical and too closed and too preoccupied to.&nbsp; And that's O.K.&nbsp; You're a beautiful person, though.<br /> <br /> 2.&nbsp; You are another consistent thing, but in a lot more unlikely way.&nbsp; We were drifting, really, and then, as if by the will of God, we converged again and now we might be as close as we've ever been - which still isn't really close, but you know.&nbsp; What's even stranger is that despite how much time we spend together, we really don't bother to deal with each other beyond what's expected and what's completely necessary.&nbsp; It's like a forced thing, but not, because I don't feel that way around you.&nbsp; Maybe you feel that way around me.&nbsp; We're too different to be close, and I think oftentimes you see me as bland and boring, but maybe that's just what you need sometimes.&nbsp; Like curry with rice.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it's my fault that we're oddly distant despite knowing each other for so long, or if it's your fault, but this isn't a complaint.&nbsp; Just a note on how odd it is, and how odd it feels sometimes.&nbsp; Sometimes I want to just check up on you, but then I realize that it would almost seem...inappropriate.&nbsp; But maybe I can work on changing it this last year that we may ever see each other.<br /> <br /> 3.&nbsp; You prefer my little sister over me.&nbsp; It makes me a little resentful, but I understand, considering I was so cold and distant and resentful for other things.&nbsp; Really, all I was doing was trying to show you that I was independent.&nbsp; I was trying to earn your respect, not a reinforcement of our friendship.&nbsp; I hated that I was your lacky for so long.&nbsp; It pissed me off!&nbsp; You had such a dominating personality and all I did was submit to it, and my (acquired?) stubborness and pride simply wouldn't allow it.&nbsp; In retrospect I probably took it too far and ended up pushing you away.&nbsp; In a way I also fed into disliking you, just because it was easier than trying to get close to you again and risk being rejected.&nbsp; You'd sort of been in the position of power for so long that I hadn't realized that you might have been waiting for me to make a move.&nbsp; Maybe that's the problem with me in a lot of my friendships.&nbsp; Either way, I miss you, even if I never thought I would.&nbsp; I'm jealous of Austin all over again.<br /> <br /> 4.&nbsp; You.....oh you.&nbsp; We've gone through a lot of ups and downs, huh?&nbsp; At this point I'm straddling remorse at how we've fallen, to joy at finally being in contact with you again, and then aloofness in an attempt to keep myself from being rejected by you, which I know I probably will.&nbsp; I was jealous of her, by the way.&nbsp; And I'm jealous of the new one -&nbsp; both for completely self-absorbed, ridiculous reasons that I don't like to admit.&nbsp; And you know, too, and I think it may disgust you.&nbsp; I miss you....aaaaand I don't.&nbsp; I dunno, you're an enigma.&nbsp; All I know is that I'm happy to see your face, even if at one point the sight of it turned my insides sour.<br /> <br /> 5&amp;6.&nbsp; This applies to 2 people: It's so easy to fall into this with you two!&nbsp; Even though I know it's daangerous, it feels nice to be close to someone again, and not close in a really personal, soul-bearing way, but just in a physical, comfortable way.&nbsp; You're not afraid to touch people, to be affectionate, and not in a creepy way (or am I just naive?).&nbsp; I know it's dangerous because I know I can be a little daft and inconsiderate and unaware of everyone else's feelings (I get so obsessed with my own).&nbsp; However, I am fully tempted to just let this go on until it reaches it's rocky conclusion.&nbsp; Please don't let it reach a rocky conclusion.&nbsp; I like sharing beds.<br /> <br /> 7.&nbsp; I'msorryI'msorryI'msorry.&nbsp; I fucked up so badly and then got angry when you didn't display abnormal amounts of understanding.&nbsp; And how the hell could I expect you to understand when I didn't even understand? I was a bitch, really.&nbsp; I don't regret what I ultimately had to do, mostly because if I had continued, it would have been ugly.&nbsp; I was trying things out for all the wrong reasons, and I'm sorry that you were an experiment.&nbsp; You're still very sweet and your face makes me want to smile every time I see it, even if you don't look at me.&nbsp; This may sound silly and ridiculous and melodramatic, but I think of you when I hear 'Martyr for my love for you' (yeah, I like icky thump, all right?&nbsp; jeez...).<br /> <br /> 8.&nbsp; I undergo some sort of transformation around you.&nbsp; I kind of like it, which is probably the only reason why I like you.&nbsp; It's strange, because I've been replacing you with a number of obsessions, but as soon as they drop off or are forgotten, you crop back up like I have some default stream of consciousness still stuck in a year ago (it's really been that long...strange).&nbsp; It's not because I feel the way I did a year ago, but the residue of such intense feelings still lingers, maybe.&nbsp; Like traces of LSD - I get flashbacks.&nbsp; And then they're gone the next moment and you're safe again.&nbsp; I admit, old habits die hard - and my habits involve constant comparison, which still haunts me like a dirty secret.&nbsp; And then sometimes I realize I never had the real opportunity to have vindicated anger towards you, and this makes me want to just sock you once ( but in the friendliest way possible!) just so that I could release whatever resentments I probably still hold.&nbsp; But generally, you're just sort of a hole.&nbsp; HAHAHA.<br /> <br /> 9.&nbsp; .....<strike>I'd let you get into my pants if you tried.</strike> ahem!<br /> <br /> 10.&nbsp; I pity you, as does everyone else.&nbsp; But this makes me respect you all the more, oddly enough, because you know it and don't care.&nbsp; I feel like you're doing the same thing you've done for 40 years, even with all of the new obstacles.&nbsp; I'm sort of excited to see what you do, and sort of eager to impress you, which I haven't really felt in a while.&nbsp; I think I'm gonna like your class, even if it does smell like my abuela's old peoples home.</div><br /><br /> <br /> This will fall upon deaf ears, or blind eyes:<br /> <br /> It would be cool if we could all say what we mean concerning each other, without all the silly memes.&nbsp; I figure I'm pretty obvious, but, if you really want to know who you are, I'll tell you.&nbsp; Putting names just always seems so...silly, ironically.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tell me exactly what you think of me, I can take it.&nbsp; And we might as well start out this year knowing where we are, riiight?<br /><br />I think I'm liking senior year."

But I was in the grocery store today buying honey because I was in the middle of making banana bread when I discovered that I was missing the essential ingredient.&nbsp; So I deliberated over what type of honey to get for about 10 minutes when I realized that I was on a semi-tight time schedule, so I just grabbed a squirtable jar and headed to a line.&nbsp; Of course, to my dismay, I was 50 cents short for this particular brand of honey.&nbsp; I was about to treck off to deliberate further on honey brands when the buff man behind me says, 'this makes five' and hands me a dollar.&nbsp;

"event","I'm all mixed up again.&nbsp; But, like, totally in a good way.

Mexico was...an experience.&nbsp; Not only was it incredible to see how completely different it is just 30 minutes from the border, but it was odd to be in the sort of position you remember looking up to as a kid, and just thinking that you're having an impact on somebody, especially a kid.&nbsp; 
John and Belinda are great people, and they really integrate their entire lives into their work, and it's really rare to come into contact with people so immersed in something, ya know?&nbsp; And something so righteous.
Seeing Blake and Kevin again was both strangely interesting and lovely.&nbsp; 
I also met Jenel, a friend of Johns from the Y, and she was such a beautiful person!&nbsp; She lives in Miami Lakes, so, maybe I'll see her again, who knows.

Some things I have learned this trip:
I have a pretty low tolerance for two year olds, no matter how adorable they may be.
I am extremely judgmental and critical of the people whom I want to love and be loved by the most.
I have some sort of higher purpose, and it'll take some groping to find it, but ya know, I'm all for groping...haha.
I need to learn to be better with children...laugh and smile and yell and be more enthusiastic.&nbsp; Maybe I need to do that in general, too.&nbsp; Or maybe not.
I need to learn to become disillusioned more gracefully.&nbsp; 
I need to learn to stop obsessing about how I look to other people, and not only in a physical way, but in a social/etc way.
I need a vegan cookbook.

Other than that, my mom is ""pre-diabetic"" and making my mistakes, which were originally hers, I suppose.&nbsp; I also intend to start exercising again because all I could afford was cheap Mexican food and/or fast food in Cali, and I feel like a disgusting slob.&nbsp; All in all, though, I feel like this may be the beginning of something big.&nbsp; Or the end of major potential, if you want to be pessimistic.
I'll be busy busy this next week, or at least I hope I will.&nbsp; Although busy-ness is always a little daunting.&nbsp; Almost always things end up half-baked, undone or sloppy, and the perfectionist in my squirms at the idea.&nbsp; But oh well.&nbsp; Don't hesitate to call and makes plans!&nbsp; But I know you wont.&nbsp; And if you tried to call/text me, my phone's been out of service for, like, ever cause my mom didnt pay the bill, so...sorry.&nbsp;

So today we went to the castle owned by William Randolph Hearst, infamous newspaper man and billionaire who built an INCREDIBLE house(s) with a pool inlaid with gold tiles and doors and ceilings from the 13th century.&nbsp; Insane extravagance.&nbsp; Then dropped my mom off at LAX and headed to meet my dad.&nbsp; Tomorrow is the Sawdust festival (art fest in Laguna beach, went there waaay back when I was here for the Robert Plant concert), then we're crashing at John and Belinda's place until the fifth, when we head out to Mexicoooooo!&nbsp; Then back here the ninth to go home, which will be nice, I suspect.&nbsp; 

So, with these meme things - am I dumb, or am I just out of the loop?&nbsp; I used to be able to pinpoint these things like it was nothin', and now all of the sudden I have no idea what anybodies talking about.&nbsp; But it's probably better that way.

Dream College : Parsons Paris School of Design 
Unfortunately, the price they gave was in euros (somewhere above 35,000), so I don't even want to think what it was in US dollars.

Reality Colleges : San Francisco Art Institute, School of Visual Arts (NY), or the Academy of Art (San Fran).

All of this has been trying, but all in all, the feeling is hopeful, if not slightly discouraged by the massive numbers representing tuition, etc.&nbsp; I kinda wish my parents had been responsible enough to have saved a little for their kids' college education, but I think my mother figured she'd never ever have to be involved in our college education, and my dad was always on the edge of financial ruin, so....too late.&nbsp; I'll be paying off student loans up to the day I retire!

"event","So, here's the thing.

I think that since I was conceived in the summer, the summer is when I must need to meet my maker, or come to grips with my mortality, or confront my existence, because it's never a good time with me.&nbsp; It's a frantic and sweaty and jittery time that has thus far had it's many ups and downs...and it's only been 3 days.&nbsp; I honestly have no idea what's going to happen, all I know is that there is this vast body called a future that is starting to shift and grumble and rumble and breathe and it's freaking me out like whoa.&nbsp; My moods switch at the drop of a dime, at the blink of an eye or the flick of a switch; I am in a constant state of anxiety and I awoke this morning&nbsp;feeling as though my stomache had been churning all night long.&nbsp;&nbsp;

And yesterday was the first day where I actually understood what it's like to want to just shut yourself off from something completely - to want to close your eyes and cover your ears and turn your head and simply ignore what's blaring and glaring and waving it's arms in front of you simply because your brain can hardly handle it.&nbsp; I think I've been doing that for a very, very, very long time now but it just hit me when it all came back and I was so ready to shut it up again.&nbsp; I know I'm being vague here, but maybe now I can stop judging people or being resentful now because I think it's something we just need to do to survive....or just to not drive ourselves completely nuts.&nbsp; Oh, who knows.&nbsp; I've been driving myself nuts over these last few days or weeks and it's all this existential nausea that's maybe been building up and that I've shut myself off to because of my fucking psycho family and weird circumstances and trying to make adult decisions about my adult life in my very adult future because I'm very sick of being a non-adult.&nbsp; But what I need to realize is that there is no adult future -&nbsp;there's just a future of mine that proceeds these days or months or years and I will continue to live in the same head possessing the same mind with the same body that I will never ever be satisfied with and all I can really do is experience everything that I can, which in turn just makes me frantic because I don't feel like I'm experiencing ANYTHING significant.&nbsp; I feel like I'm at a fucking stalemate.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will never progress as a human being.

On a completely different note, Belinda - John's girlfriend -&nbsp;John the head of Manos - -&nbsp;came over and I made her pasta and we talked and talked about Mexico and China and Vietnam and even India and Cuba and part of me wonders if I could do that for a part of my life, or maybe even the rest of my life.&nbsp; It's just hearing her endless array of stories and seeing how working with the kids and making a difference has shaped her that...makes me want to do something, I guess.&nbsp; We'll see, we'll see, whatever, I need to slow down.&nbsp; Slllooowww doooowwwwnn.

Bollywood party at my house tomorrow!&nbsp; hopefully..."

I've made a lot of mistakes; I'm sorry!&nbsp; I'm a dumb girl!&nbsp; I'm impatient and silly and idealistic and thick-headed and a little too hopeful in doomed situations, or too pessimistic in hopeful ones.&nbsp; I'm kickin' myself.&nbsp; Do you see these?&nbsp; They're bruises from how often I've slapped my forehead.&nbsp; My teeth are sore from how often I've stuck my foot in my mouth - the foot that just finished kicking me in my own ass.&nbsp; mm, but what's the use, the only person left to forgive me is myself. 

I'm riled up!&nbsp; I'm focused!

But it'll amount to nothing, I'm sure, and that's just fine.

And I am the absolute ruler of completely pointless ambiguity!

It seems that the only time I am really concerned with someone elses confusion and pain is when it mirrors my own.&nbsp; The thing is, I never realize it until after I've been an obnoxious prick bitch, squirming my way into someones confused pyschi, muddling the situation all the worse, when I claim to be ""helping.""&nbsp; I really need to work my own shit out before I try and help someone else, because I just fuck things up.&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to assess all of the weird chest/stomache/gut/head/general indecisive feelings that seem to be the norm lately.&nbsp; Then again, there's no driving desire motivating me to confront anything or take&nbsp;any&nbsp;action pertaining&nbsp;(""ACTION OR STAGNATION!&nbsp; FIRE IT UP!"").

"event","I guess this is a farewell letter.&nbsp; Let's start at the beginning.

I was a happy kid.&nbsp; I bore&nbsp;my baby teeth&nbsp;regularly.&nbsp; I had no inhibitions and no self-conscious thoughts pertaining to them.&nbsp; I guess maybe because as a small child, my baby teeth were generally straight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I remember loosing those teeth to make room for you.&nbsp; I remember peering into the mirror when I would feel a loose one, watching as it would wiggle with the prodding from my tongue.&nbsp; I remember bracing myself against the carpet and the wall mirror and attempting to yank them out, but&nbsp;I was chicken.&nbsp; After they would fall free and find their rightful place beneath my slumbering head, I would tongue you all night, feeling where the head of you would already be poking through my childish gums.

As you began to grow in and shift around, I began to notice the crowding, the odd placements, the irregularities of position.&nbsp; My teeth were not like my mothers - I had my fathers teeth.&nbsp; I had canines that were unusually high; more that were oddly low.&nbsp; Strange gaps formed where these teeth should have been placed.&nbsp; My fellow fourth graders were getting braces, were flashing metal smiles.&nbsp; It seemed undesirable to have such unruly&nbsp;contraptions caging my teeth - I was free! - but at once, it was just as undesirable to have these imperfections.&nbsp; I learned to smile less with you.&nbsp; I became tight-lipped.

Recently, however, I had learned to love you.&nbsp; Yes, my smile was strange.&nbsp; Yes, my teeth often contorted my lips in a way that made my close-mouthed&nbsp;smile odd, unpretty - and yet I managed to come to terms with the idea of you.&nbsp; I would never have perfect teeth, I would never have the perfect smile, and I would have to endure life with 'teeth with character.'&nbsp; While Invisalign commercials still haunted me, I was slowly becoming content with you.&nbsp; I smiled more.&nbsp; I laughed out loud.&nbsp; I still didn't bare you readily, but gone were the days were I would snigger behind a cupped hand.

And then came the day when my mother anounced that we had an orthodontist apointment.&nbsp; How strange the words sounded - at once, my dreams were coming true, and then again, the idea of loosing somethng that made me ""unique"" was presented.&nbsp; Naturally, I reacted with fear and resistance.&nbsp; I was just beginning to like you!&nbsp; People were beginning ot reassure me that you weren't that bad!&nbsp; And now, to abandon my endeavor so early in the game seemed proposterous!&nbsp; Dear teeth!&nbsp; I resisted the idea of loosing your funny alignment, your quirky placement - believe me!&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, I believe this will be the best for the both of us.&nbsp; Let me explain, in the somberest of tones.

While you are a symbol of anarchy, of iconoclastic rebellion, of singularity, I must admit they you have caused a complex.&nbsp; For the longest time I hid you behind my hand.&nbsp; Even now, if someone asks to see my teeth, I will refuse.&nbsp; For all of my admiration of character, I find that acceptance of my own form of ""character"" is difficult.&nbsp; So I hid you, and you were shrouded in shame, dear teeth.&nbsp; Forgive me.&nbsp; But I believe that now, with these corrections, that I may become comfortable with you, finally, in entirety, and you will no longer be hidden.&nbsp; Is this not a positive thing?&nbsp; So rejoice, teeth -&nbsp;you will no longer be locked between&nbsp;the darkness of my lips.&nbsp; You will get to see daylight!

As to my left molar and wisdome teeth, a better life to you beyond my mouth.&nbsp; While i cannot fathom the life you will lead seperated from me, I wish you the best of luck, for you are the ones who will truly leave me!&nbsp; The most melancholy of fairwells!

Sincerely,&nbsp; your host,

Taylor.

"event","There is a small calous forming on the interior of my right wrist towards the left.&nbsp; I wont disclose the reason why, but, needless to say, some degenerative habits have been exacerbated by the sudden isolation&nbsp;brought about by&nbsp;homework and general home-bodi-ness.&nbsp; Some aspects of the day were refreshing - I like working steadily for an hour and a half in my drawing and painting class with no disturbances;&nbsp; I like eating lunch at our tree, even if it is atop an iron trap door; &nbsp;I like chatting away in Mrs. Rust's room; I like having extensive conversations by the sink while I should be painting; I like driving home with Katie and making smoothie plans; I like getting back into the groove of things.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the groove of things also involves long hours of mild&nbsp;anxiety at how quickly the month is going to go by, and how little time I have to get done what I need to get done.

The NCTE test is next Tuesday, and I should have turned in my 10 pages yesterday, but I haven't written anything substantial since last semester.
The SCAD application is due May 1st and I only have one slide that I'm not sure Im happy with.&nbsp; I also have Mrs. Rust's pot that I want to put in there that is nowhere near done.&nbsp; I also have to somehow get slides for my photography pieces.
It's crunch time in Siflinger's class and I am burned out.
I am WAY behind in both of my art classes, and the general compliance of my teachers can only last for so long.
and

is it too audacious to hope that one day, mood swings may have good timing?
(Damn literature for putting silly ideas in your head.&nbsp; Observation should really by the main source of prototypes concerning the unknown, not flowery language and complex storylines filled&nbsp;with terrifically idealistic notions that only lead to dissapointment)

This is all besides the point."

"event","So today I had no immediately urgent engagements or deeds to be done,&nbsp;and when&nbsp;I walked&nbsp;through my door I&nbsp;put my bookbag down on a chair, walked slowly to the couch, shook off my sandals, and took a gloooooooorious nap on my gloooooooooriously comfortable couch and had some gloooooooooriously strange dreams.&nbsp; There was something about flying over this huge city, and at first I couldn't get over this hill (I was drivinh a plane) but then I did and flew over all of the little houses and buildings - it was like something out of a Michel Gondry thing, honestly.&nbsp; So I land in this little luscious green garden (no longer in a plane, just me flying) and sit on this stone bench and there are these amazing unicorns...but really strange.&nbsp; First off, they were HUGE and just gorgeous, golden and godly like they were sent from heaven.&nbsp; But their skin sort of....I don't know how to explain it.&nbsp; Instead of wrapping around their torsos it fell down like a sheet over them, and so they had these large billowing sheets of skin around their legs - but it was so pretty, like they were dressed in gowns or something.&nbsp; Whatever, it was weird, but I try to touch one and it just looks at me with these huge golden eyes and I fall at its feet in this strange, slow way.&nbsp; Then Austin and my mom come looking for me and I get up and leave.

Other than that it was a typical Valentines Day.&nbsp; Photo Club made $218&nbsp;off of teenage lust and/or indifference/procrastination - or cute stuffed animals, depending on how you look at it.&nbsp; Ate a decent amount of chocolate, but I'm stopping myself before I feel like vomiting.

Our&nbsp;air conditioner is broken for good.&nbsp; We apparently have to replace the entire thing, which will cost us thousands - although my dad rolled his eyes when he heard that figure.&nbsp; For now, though, most of the doors and windows are open in the house and my hair is all crazy from the humidity.&nbsp; I tried to cook an Indian dish last night, and while my dad loved it, I thought it was sort of strange because the gravy was really thick and there wasn't a lot - it barely covered the, like, 12 kofta's the other mixture made.&nbsp; Oh well, my dad said he liked it a lot, which, even if&nbsp;he was just being nice, works out?&nbsp; He had extra...I dunno, I slaved over that stove for 2 hours, that's what counts.

Weekend looks hectic,&nbsp;as it always does with my dad.&nbsp; I kind of want things to calm down on that end, just have&nbsp;a pleasant weekend hanging out with my dad, doing something simple, like when we went to see the margaluise collection a few weekends ago.&nbsp; He seemed happy then.&nbsp; Oh dear, I hope he has fun at Coachella if he ends up taking me to the actual festival.&nbsp; Ugh, I feel so bad, but there's nothing we can do, the tickets are bought.&nbsp; Maybe I can do something to make it better while we're there?&nbsp; Ugh, I just hope it ends up that he can spend his time with his buddies having fun while I go to the festival.&nbsp; And honestly, he's not the type to wait in front of a stage for an hour just to keep&nbsp;a good&nbsp;spot.&nbsp; I am.

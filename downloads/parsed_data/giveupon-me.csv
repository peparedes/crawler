"event","I&nbsp;really miss being a part of a team. I wanted to join an intramural team this quarter, but I'm still trying to figure out this whole studying thing. I watched the Penguins' Town Hall Meeting online last night and just watching those guys interact with each other takes me back to the days when we were a team. Even back to premier with Frank. We weren't close like high school because we didn't see each other everyday, but we all had a common goal, to win. We weren't the greatest team out there, but we always had fun. Even if Frank was yelling at us, we would laugh it off and let it roll off of our shoulders, but high school was a time that I&nbsp;will never forget. We were a family in every sense of the word. We won together, lost together, ate together, cried together, and laughed together. Sophomore and Junior years were by far the greatest time of my life. I&nbsp;will never forget our last game against Buckeye Junior year. The seniors stayed out on the field and I&nbsp;had left because it was their time to be together, and the next day at school&nbsp; Sarah came up to me and told me that they were wondering where I&nbsp;was. It was then that I&nbsp;realized how central I&nbsp;was to the team, and maybe I&nbsp;did get over confident after that. Someone needed to, though. No one had the guts to accept the change that was coming. Maybe I&nbsp;trust too easily and that was my downfall. I&nbsp;will <strong>never</strong> let that happen again. I&nbsp;still cry about it and I&nbsp;don't feel the least bit embarrassed. To be honest, I'm afraid to touch a soccer ball for the sole reason that it brings back every memory from this past season. I miss it so much, though. <br />I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;found my replacement. Hockey has become something to me that I&nbsp;can't explain. It's something bigger than me. I don't have the mentality that I&nbsp;could go out there and do better. I&nbsp;just enjoy watching it, and the guys who play. I'll admit that. There are some very attractive hockey players, but I&nbsp;just love watching it. The adrenaline rush is so intense. I&nbsp;made an impulse buy today and I&nbsp;think my mom's going to kill me. I&nbsp;bought a ticket to the Penguins and Blue Jackets game. It's a pretty decent seat. I&nbsp;just hope someone will go with me *coughcough rachel coughcough*. There is this guy who lives upstairs who's a huuuuge hockey fan and he said he could fly us to a game in Pittsburgh for my birthday. Even if we drove I&nbsp;would not care one bit.<br />If you read this whole thing, God bless you. haha. I&nbsp;miss everyone a lot. But I&nbsp;might be coming home the weekend Annie is. I&nbsp;got my web-cam so I&nbsp;should be talking to Annie soon!!<br /><br /><br />"

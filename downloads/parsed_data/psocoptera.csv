"event","Category, picture books about hockey.  <b>Rotten Richie and the Ultimate Dare</b> is by Patricia Polacco (a bunch of parents just nodded in recognition) and combines quarreling siblings (relevant to my family) and hockey (of interest to my family) with Polacco's characteristically appealing art and quality prose.  Trisha and her brother Richie dare each other to try each other's sports - Trisha suits up for one of Richie's hockey games and Richie joins her ballet recital.  As you might expect they both end up with an appreciation for the other sport, make valuable contributions, feel stronger in their own sport from the experience, reach a heartwarming truce, etc, plus my kids were fascinated that hockey players in the 50s (when the book is set) didn't wear helmets."

"event","<b>Tell the Wind and Fire</b> is very Sarah Rees Brennan, full of her favorite themes - brothers, birthrights, what it means to be human, dark mirrors held up to interrogate same.  If you liked the Demon books or the Lynburn books you'll probably like this one.  It's got some really cool worldbuilding (nifty magic system stuff), some gorgeous writing in the running light-imagery motif, and very Brennan-esque emotional punch (think Team Human-level crying, people).  *Plus*, it does an invaluable service to the world by being a sort of fantasy reimagining of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, a book which I barely remember except to remember that I found it unbearably dull.  I'm sure it would have been *much more interesting* to get to read it with this one under the table, so to speak, and get to play ""spot the parallel"" and ""wow she took *that* in a different direction"", and I like to think that some contemporary 9th grader out there is getting to do exactly that.  ""Stryver vs Stryker: the one-letter change that illuminates 19th vs 21st century conceptions of ignobility"", that sort of thing.

(I looked that up, about Stryver; I was curious how closely she'd followed Dickens' plot, although I think it would read just fine without any Dickens background at all.  Like I said, I really only remembered the one thing - ""it is a far far better thing, etc"" - and wasn't *that* a stressful ride, waiting to see what she was going to do with that.  Invert, subvert, play straight, whyyy did we hand Brennan this very sharp trope again?  I was not disappointed.  And I thought her handling of the various interpersonal relationships, romance, possible triangles, etc, was all very adroit.)"

"event","Volume Two of the adventures of Kamala Khan.  I didn't read this in time to nominate it for a Graphic Hugo, but I would have; the message is pretty heavy-handed, but I don't mind that, in my superhero comics, and Kamala is just such a great character.  I love seeing her use her powers, I love seeing her navigate the two-identity life, her team-up with Wolverine is fantastic, and I appreciate that the art stays away from T&A and gore, since my kids have demonstrated that they will pick up and look through any comic I bring home, and I'd rather they not get used to superboobs and bloody violence just yet."

I would be pretty surprised to learn that Becky Chambers *doesn't* have an AO3 account (or at least used to, I know weird things happen in the mysterious process of Going Pro).  <b>The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet</b> is her first novel and it is fast and delightful and totally written by someone who loved Firefly and probably at least two of Star Trek, Babylon 5, and Farscape.  Found family, alien races politely (or sometimes less politely) trying to get along, a couple of ethical dilemmas, some episodic action - I hope it becomes a series of books, it's not unresolved at all but I very much feel right now that I just watched the first season of something, fell in love with all the characters, and want to see what they'll get thrown at them next season.

"event","Took the kids to a language research study at Harvard today, and it was *fascinating* - over the course of a twenty-minute experiment Q went from using gender-neutral labels to mimicking the experimenter in using gendered labels.

The setup involved them taking turns describing simple scenes, and the actual study was about double-object vs prepositional-object sentences, which I didn't even catch, while observing.  What I did catch was that at first Q's descriptions were all ""the person swinging the hammer"" or ""the person had the flowers"", or, once, ""the grownup"", for a woman, while the experimenter always said ""the girl"", ""the boy"", ""the man"", or ""the woman"" (four repeating characters).  At some point, Q switched to also using those terms, maybe once the characters became familiar through repetition?  I love these experiments because I always end up noticing things the kids do I never would at home - it was really interesting to hear my language quirk (I tend to say ""person"" for anyone, real or character, I don't know the name of) coming out of his mouth, and then to see how quickly he adapted to someone else's pattern instead.  (And if the experimenter and I had traded in and out, I suppose we could have discovered if Q has code-switching yet...)  Totally going to try to get him to describe me a scene tomorrow and see if he opts for ""person"" or a gendered term, see how persistent that effect was."

I eventually ran out of library renewals, though, so I gave it another try, pushed myself through the next 40 pages, and then devoured the remaining 500 as fast as I could find time to read.  It really, really picked up for me once we met more of the characters, found out more about what was going on, and saw some of the bigger-picture conflicts that will presumably drive the rest of the series (I am very eagerly awaiting book two in September).

"event","<b>Burning Midnight</b>, Will McIntosh.  Fast-paced fun ""teens caught up in SFnal Events"" story.  I've liked his short fiction and this did not disappoint; neat gimmick, fun unpredictable ride unfolding it.  Might appeal to fans of <i>Ready Player One</i> or Westerfeld's Midnighters books or <i>So Yesterday</i>.  2016 book, standalone.

<b>Across the Universe</b>, Beth Revis.  A set-up with a lot of power (teen chooses to accompany parents in cryo on interstellar flight, gets woken up early, has to adjust to life on generation ship) sadly bogged down by doing an Authorities With Secrets plot.  Whyyy do so many YA authors default to this instead of trusting the inherent story of their premise?  Someone already wrote <i>The Giver</i> perfectly, it was Lois Lowry, can't we move on?  Also, I will accept from a woman author an attempted-rape-of-female-character scene I would have no patience for from a male author, but when the book kicks off with such a well-done intense body-violation scene with the cryosleep, it felt both unnecessary and less compelling.  I don't think I'll read the rest of the trilogy.

<b>The Sleeper and the Spindle</b>, Neil Gaiman, with pretty pen-and-ink illustrations by Chris Riddell.  Very classic ""vintage"" feeling in the illustrations, plus you know that Gaiman's going to have something fresh and interesting to say in his fairytale retelling, what an excellent little project all around.

<b>To Hold The Bridge</b>, Garth Nix collection of previously-published stories.  I liked the titular Old Kingdom novella, and many of the rest are enjoyable enough.  Some of them felt kind of samey-samey, gathered all together like this.  I liked ""A Handful of Ashes"".  Oh, note, ""To Hold The Bridge"" is set in the Old Kingdom but there are no familiar characters in it, so don't read it in hopes of seeing more Sam or whatever."

(I thought it was aware of and critical of its gender ickiness, although I can understand a preference for movies not being icky in the first place...)

World of Tomorrow, on the other hand, didn't really work for me; yes, there were a lot of Big SF Ideas, some of which seem sort of clever or cute in retrospect, but it was so weird that it was awkward to watch with other people, and so bleak.  I'll be a little surprised if it gets nominated, it seems like more of a movie critic movie than something average Hugo voters would go for, maybe?"

"event","So it turns out I've been wrong all this time about what makes someone a Pro Artist or a Fan Artist - I thought selling work to a semiprozine made you a Pro Artist (in the way that if a writer sells a story to a semipro it's a professional sale), but actually it makes you a Fan Artist, and to know whether an art work was Professional you have to know whether someone who was part of whatever published it earned at least a quarter of their yearly income from SFF publishing.  (I have no idea if that has to be a *living* income or if someone non-self-supporting could have a micropress as their only line of work, make a tiny amount of money from it, and commission Pro art?) Basically the whole thing makes no fucking sense, especially since, just to further confuse things, someone can be eligible in both categories, for different works, but you're not supposed to consider the Fan works thinking about them as a Pro or the other way around, but it's still not a work award, it's a person award.  (There's more about this <a href=""http://hugoeligibleart.tumblr.com/post/138322715742/on-fan-art-and-best-fan-artist"">here</a> as well as a proposal to fix it.  I could also imagine redoing it as, like, Best Cover (which would honor striking design as well as nifty SFF art), Best Non-Cover Sold Work, and Best Personal Work, or something, I don't know.)  It's extra frustrating given that Fan Artist is a relatively undernominated category where a nomination can really make a difference, if only it was easier to be sure one was doing it right!

"event","My library loan ran out on Seth Dickinson's <b>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</b> and I don't think I'm going to re-queue for it, so, partial review.  Really well-written but I realized after starting it that I remembered the short story it was based on (<a href=""http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/the-traitor-baru-cormorant-her-field-general-and-their-wounds-by-seth-dickinson/"">here</a>) and nothing was going to end well and, look, I don't mean to say that people shouldn't write angry/frustrated/despairing books, there are lots of reasons to be angry/frustrated/despairing and to want to grapple with the harshness of the world in literature, but I am a simple little mind that enjoys feeling good feelings, I like my tragedy all beautiful and operatic, or, even better, I want hope and happy endings.  I don't know, maybe I would have ended up loving it - the writing was really good - but in a world of limited time, I am just not enthused about reading a novel so I can get slammed with painfulness."

"event","<b>Binti</b>, Nnedi Okorafor, a Nebula-nominated novella published by Tor as part of their new novella line.  I liked it!  Nifty character background and detail around a classic ""communication with previously-uncommunicatable-aliens"" plot; there's some really solid, moving stuff about being changed by experiences, and what it means to be a stranger in a foreign land, made neatly concrete by some of the aforementioned character background.  Also some good visuals and unexpected little moments - I could imagine the whole thing animated by Miyazaki, maybe, made me think of Nausicaa, or Laputa. Recommended!"

"event","<b>Updraft</b>, by Fran Wilde, turned out to be too YA for my increasingly curmudgeonly tastes.  Started out strong with a fascinating setting - people who live in skyscraper-like living bone towers, flying from tower to tower with manufactured wings, never seeing the ground - but the plot and characters ended up being aeriel <i>Divergent</i>, more or less.  Which, hey, good for Wilde, that's a fine reading public to want to provide with more books they'll enjoy, but I'm not part of it and I found it unbearably tedious.

The thing is, if you introduce a highly-resource-limited world, whether that's a water-world or a desert-world or an air-world, I want to know *how the fuck it works*, like, how did people end up in that situation? How do they support the population size? Where are they getting these raw materials?  I start reading something like Updraft, I want it to be The Martian, I want to know if they actually have enough dirt to grow all those peas and potatoes and fruit and how they haul it from level to level as they move up the towers.  And they're all wearing spider-silk, if the spiders live on ambient insects, that helps, and they're supplementing their diet with hunted birds, and metal is a rare artifact of the past, and there's clearly been some clever thinking here! Maybe it all works! But I want the tour, I want to get to see the farms and the spider herds and enjoy the fantastic-ness of all this fantasy world.  With less having my disbelief un-suspensioned every time someone casually chucks buckets of organic waste out the window, like, *really*, your carbon cycle doesn't need that back?

Instead of world-tourism we get an endless emotionally-incoherent Conspiracies-Family Secrets-and-Webs of Betrayal(TM) Plot, which kicks off when the Secretive Ruling Caste like totally unfairly keeps the main character from passing her driving test even though she like totally studied, which eventually leaves her no choice but to become one of them and aaagh I am so sick of one very special girl dismantling the ludicrous rigid traditions of her society with her special determination.  Ok, that's unfair, I've loved that book before and I'll probably love it again, but this wasn't it.  The writing was painfully repetitive and I felt like it was hammering me with its narrative keywords as opposed to, y'know, actually getting me to care about any of them.  I will give it points for No Romance, that's rare in this genre and I imagine it took some guts for Wilde to stand by not stuffing one in.

I will rec a related short story by Wilde in the same world, <a href=""http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/bent-the-wing-dark-the-cloud/"">Bent the Wing, Dark the Cloud</a>, that doesn't show much of the world, but is much emotionally stronger."

"event","<b>Sorcerer to the Crown</b>, Zen Cho.  Magic and manners in Regency England, where the main characters are transracial adoptees of color, and British Imperialism gets subverted.  I've been looking forward to reading this, having been a big fan of her short fiction, and it was good!  Pacing a little uneven and a nontrivial plothole, but some really great moments, clever details, awesome scenes, etc.  I was somewhat surprised to learn it's the first of a trilogy because it felt very satisfying as a standalone, but I definitely look forward to seeing where she goes next.  Recommended to fans of Sorcery & Cecelia, or maybe Temeraire, or anyone who likes Regency romance and fantasy.  Would make a *phenomenal* miniseries: it's fairly episodic, there's a lot of great visual images, historical costumes + magic = yes.  John Boyega as Zacharias, Naomi Scott as Prunella (ok, I didn't have a young South Asian actress in mind, I did some google research to come up with her), it would be sooooo good."

I feel like when I write tropey fanfic (universe-swapping, mysterious duplicates, shrinking, etc) my characters tend to be much more focused on solving the problem than in some other similar fic.  I liked the problem-solving focus in this time-travel story.

"event","I think in the tumult of Christmas I never posted about this. <i>Sanjay's Super Team</i> is the best Pixar short ever.  I have probably said this before (Day & Night, Boundin') but, no, really, this time, I *mean* it, it is an entirely different kind of thing than a neat visual gimmick or an inspirational poem, it's simultaneously epic cosmic high fantasy, and amazing character work, all in this teeny-tiny space of, like, seven minutes.  I would watch a full-length feature trilogy expansion of it though, it's just - stylistically SO COOL, and the backstory (with the photos at the end) took my breath away.  I don't think it can be purchased online at this time which is unfortunate because I want to tell everyone in the world to a) watch it, because it is so good, you want it in your eyeballs if you do visual media at all, and b) nominate it for the Hugo Dramatic Short-form (I usually try to stay away from ""you should nominate this"" language, but I just want everyone to get to know about it!).

The Good Dinosaur, the movie it screened with, is not so exciting.  Phenomenal photorealistic nature animation but the story was pretty by-the-numbers.  Which is fine - ""some cute moments and nothing really obnoxious"" is not a bad kids-movie experience - but it's too bad that Sanjay's Super Team might not have gotten as many in-theater views because it got paired with a less-enticing feature."

"event","<b>The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps</b>, by Kai Ashante Wilson, is a grippingly terrific fantasy tale, or possibly I mean science fiction-fantasy.  Caravan guards! Children of the departed gods! Modern slang and nifty Clarkean magic!  Achingly good character work! Vivid action! It reminded me in some ways of <i>Dreamsnake</i>, or possibly, like, Darkover, although I never actually read any of those beyond a short story or two so I could be wrong about that.  Michael Chabon, maybe, in the breadth of language, the range of voices, the pleasurableness (is that a word?) of the words themselves.  Maybe there are cliches of the fantasy trek here but it just felt so fresh and immersing.

The one thing I'm not sure of is what to call it, a novel or a novella.  Tor published it in their novella line and is calling it one in their 2015 fiction roundup; however, the wordcount is 43000 words, which by the Hugo rules is Not A Novella.  BUT, there's apparently a rule wherein the Awards Subcommittee can move a work to another category if it's within the lesser of 5K words or 20% of the new category limits. BUT, your vote only moves if you don't have five nominations in that category already.  BUT, there's no way to know in advance whether they're going to move it or not; they won't rule until the actual nomination ballots make them have to.  Strategically, <i>Sorcerer</i> would probably have a better shot in the novella field than the more-competitive novel field.  However, I'm a longstanding proponent of the idea of Bringing Back The Short Novel, so it feels a bit odd to be like ""no that's a novella"" when one appears, and novel feels like the track it will naturally be on unless the subcom throws a switch, so I'm probably going to nominate it as a novel."

"event","<b>Walk On Earth A Stranger</b>, the first book in Rae Carson's new probably-trilogy in which a gold-sensing girl dresses as a boy to head west in the California gold rush, pretty much had me at ""Rae Carson"" and ""girl dresses as a boy"".  I liked her <i>Girl of Fire and Thorns</i> trilogy a lot, and that's one of my favorite tropes.  And I was not disappointed!  Carson has an interesting take on the emotional aspect of the cross-dressing business, and it keeps you turning the pages.  The particulars aren't going to be terribly surprising to anyone familiar with Oregon Trail (time to hunt! someone's died of dysentery!) but it's well-written and vivid and has a good secondary cast and stuff.  Not mindblowing, but quality YA entertainment, and I'll be eagerly awaiting the next one."

"event","Tor seems to be moving their novella publishing away from their free online fiction and into $2.99 ebooks, but they put up a couple, before they started that.  GigaNotoSaurus, meanwhile, published mostly novelettes and short stories last year, which I think is a move away from their previous all-novelette pattern.  Anyways.  Three novellas, for your novella-reading pleasure.

A gorgeous, slow-building fantasy of history and memory and family like a sort of emotionally-inverted Lovecraft story, sublime instead of horrific.  Highly recommended.

<a href=""http://www.tor.com/2015/06/10/waters-of-versailles-kelly-robson/"">Waters of Versailles</a>, Kelly Robson, Tor.com. Magical plumbing in 1738 Versailles. Cute idea.

<a href=""http://giganotosaurus.org/2015/12/01/quarter-days/"">Quarter Days</a>, Iona Sharma, in GigaNotoSaurus. Magic and recovery in post-WWI London.  This is set in the same world as <a href=""http://www.strangehorizons.com/2015/20150420/hours-f.shtml"">Nine Thousand Hours</a>, a few generations earlier, verrry interesting to see that kind of thought put into the worldbuilding, not just what makes a neat alternate present but the alternate past that goes with it and how it evolved.  I would love to see more stories in this world from even further in the past, or elsewhere in the world.

Let me just point out here that Iona Sharma is Campbell-eligible (Nine Thousand Hours was her first qualifying work) and I'll definitely be nominating her for it."

They're working on ""9 in all"", making a table of all the combinations of blocks and marbles one could have if one had ""some blocks and some marbles"" and 9 total.  Thing is, they're supposed to start with 9 of one and zero of the other, and while I like the mathematical insight that ""zero is a number"", as one kid said in the discussion and the teacher repeated, I feel like in real life, when talking about actual objects, ""some"" is understood to refer to a positive quantity, and isn't the whole point of story problems to get them to think about what these numbers really mean?  I mean, if I call a restaurant, and they say their menu changes daily depending on what's available but there are always 9 choices, some meat and some vegetarian entrees, and I show up with my vegetarian friend and they're like ""today it's 9 meat and 0 vegetarian because 0 is a number"", my response is going to be more like ""you're fucking kidding me"" than ""oh isn't that mathematically clever"".

I always get annoyed by things like ""the outstanding SF trilogy of the decade"" in 2015 - kind of discounts the potential of a few years there - but. I mean. It's *so* relevant and important, and also funny and moving and smart.  Expect to see this one on the awards lists."

"event","It's possible, maybe even likely, that I have some sort of reading malaise going on this fall.  Read Maggie Stiefvater's <b>Raven Boys</b> during the summer, never reviewed it, started <b>Dream Thieves</b> and never finished it, started Patrice Kindl's <i>A School For Brides</i> and didn't get very far, didn't get past chapter one of Ernest Cline's <i>Armada</i> *twice*, tried Stiefvater's <i>Scorpio Races</i> and just didn't care, keep meaning to read the Dragonbreath books while Junie tears through them and haven't, meh.

Oh, I liked Steven Gould's <b>Exo</b>, finishing the <i>Jumper</i> series, a lot, couldn't put that down actually.  So I guess I haven't entirely lost the ability to read. To everything there is a season I guess."

"event","Just watched it again, and I think the real problem with the girl volcano is the chin.  Like, the lava flow hair is actually pretty cool, but she has to look ""attractive"", and so she has to look *thin*, and so she needs that very un-mountain-like defined chin and neck.  Because god forbid a female character look like a lumpy cone.

I was thinking about this because Q's been asking me to read ""The Little Engine That Could"", and it really struck me that the titular blue engine is female, but in the original illustrations, not drawn with the ubiquitous eyelashes or lipstick of contemporary feminized objects.

<b>General</b>
I have no particular squicks or triggers to worry about.  I like humor and angst and fluff and smut, gen and shippiness.  I realize this is pretty darn useless as a guide but honestly if you're writing in one of these fandoms I'm more or less guaranteed to be excited about it?

<b>O Human Star</b>
<a href=""http://ohumanstar.com/"">O Human Star online here</a>

O Human Star is an in-progress webcomic about a resurrected roboticist Al, his former partner Brendan, and his partner's robot daughter Sulla.

I am thrilled by the very notion that there could possibly be fanfiction for this wonderful comic.  I'd be into pretty much any story you wanted to tell.  If you'd like a prompt or idea, maybe something like Al & Sulla (or Al, Brendan, and Sulla) on a trip to the zoo, or Brendan & Sulla doing something together when Sulla was younger? Some kind of family interaction, perhaps where someone's robot nature becomes unexpectedly relevant? Or Brendan having sex with robot Al, if you like writing that kind of thing.

<b>Belle</b>
A movie that came out in 2014 in the United States.

I would be happy to get to see more of any part of Dido's life. Dido as a child. Dido as a mother. Dido with John.  Dido talking to Mabel.  If you are into doing research, Dido reacting to any interesting historical/cultural event of her time.

<b>Magic Mike XXL</b>
A movie that came out in 2015 in the United States.

So I thought there were two moments in the movie with real sexual tension: when Mike first watches Malik dance, and when he kneels for Rome and kisses her hand.  I would love to see some more exploration of either of those relationships/interactions - Mike's mirror dance with Malik at the end had so much potential in theory, but I felt like they really dropped the ball on the possible homoeroticism there.  I like the idea that Mike's response to Malik has both a competitive edge and a desire edge, and how might that play out.  And Mike submitting to Rome was just hot.  In general, I'm more interested in character dynamics and tension here than in whose body parts do what, but I don't mind that either if your story goes that way?  If you're really not into Malik or Rome, I also really liked Mike's solo dance at the beginning, I'd be curious to get a look inside his head about how he feels about dancing by himself/for himself vs with an audience."

I do not understand whatsoever how this is supposed to ""fight makeup shaming"" when it's picture after picture of how great someone looks without all that crap on their face.

I know, I know, there are so many people who love it.  There are people I love who love it! My beloved and delightful sister, for one, and many more.  And, you know, I support everyone in doing whatever the heck they want with their personal appearance, whether they're trying to be ""pretty"" or ""ugly"" or ""camouflaged"" or whatever the fuck else anyone can think of to do.  Be weird! Be challenging! Yay!

But eek, gah, yikes, looking at these pictures makes me sad, the way I feel sad about people cutting down their trees and putting in astroturf lawns, the way I feel sad about bad movies of good books, even though those are also legit personal expressions.  Maybe I'm not supposed to admit that.  And in fact I rarely feel that way about anyone's face I see in real life, I mean, my sister's face is the face of someone I love and want to talk to, so I'm thinking that, not, like, taking inventory of whether I think she's changed her lip color or whatever.  (I honestly couldn't tell you whether she usually wears lipstick.  Fancy eye stuff, yes.)  I just... I don't know.  I really, REALLY hate the current extent of the makeup Overton window, and the half-face thing just invites a this-vs-that, and I definitely Have A Side there."

"event","Had the world's most stereotypical suburban mom temper tantrum and committed mass culling upon The Socks.  Somehow my children had between them three different sets of the same socks, in two or possibly three different sizes, meaning that I never knew whose goddamn socks they were when folding the laundry, argh, socks.

In the course of buying them each a new set of socks, I made the amazing discovery that apparently I can't tell their socks apart because in sock-sizing terms, they have the *same size feet* - Q is wearing a 9 shoe and J is wearing a 13 shoe and there seems to be a sock size that goes from 9 to 2 1/2.  Which, eureka, stop the fucking presses, no wonder I'm so confused!  So I guess I didn't need to buy new socks at all, I could have just assigned out the existing socks according to some memorable rule, but, whatever, I have such hatred at this point towards those confounding little suckers that it's honestly a pleasure to heap them up for the rag bag.

Such is the exciting life of the housewife."

5950 total voters.  Looking at the novellas (5337 voters), 3495 for No Award, 1842 splitting the nominees, with one of the Wright stories and the two non-Wright stories roughly evenly matched around 500-550, and the other two Wright stories majorly trailing in the 100-150 range.

So one interesting thing here is that even if the Puppies had put out an official *order* for their slate, and gotten those 1842 votes backing one candidate, they still would have been crushed by the No Award voters.  We see that again in Short Story, where there are 3053 No Award voters and 2214 for all five nominees.

It's still true but less pronounced looking at the Editor categories, 2672 No vs 2178 Anyone for the Short and 2496 No vs 2411 Anyone for the Long.  Also of interest here, 586 first place votes for VD in the Short, 166 first place votes for him in the Long, he eventually runs-off to 5th place in the Short and last place in the Long.  Still an unbelievable embarrassment to the field that he was on our ballot, but on the other hand, that's 12% of the Short category and Deez Nuts is polling at 9% in the Republican Primary in North Carolina.

Chaos will think this is interesting: in the novelettes, ""Day the World Turned Upside Down"" and No Award were 1700 to 1732 in the first pass, and it took three eliminations for ""Day"" to pull ahead.  Hugo voting people not wildly excited about this candidate.  Wesley Chu, on the other hand, 2655 out of the gate against 529 No Award.

I'll probably link to more analysis as it happens.

Tobias Buckell put together the <a href=""http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/2015/08/23/what-the-alternate-hugo-ballot-would-likely-have-been/"">likely Puppy-free ballot here</a>.

Novels:
The most interesting thing to me here is the presence of <i>The Martian</i> on the longlist.  I *seriously* thought this wasn't eligible.  Also interesting: the total absence of <i>The Magician's Land</i>.  Really, Hugo nominators?  I mean, I didn't nom it, but it was a pretty major release for the year, and really excellent if you can read with slightly less feminist eyes than I could.

Novellas:
I'm sad that I didn't get that Nancy Kress novella in the packet; I suppose I could see if the library has it, or ::gasp:: actually buy it.  I thought Swirsky's ""Grand Jete"" was pretty great, pleased to see it in the contenders.

Novelette:
I came very close to nominating ""Litany of Earth"", although in the end I did not, but I would have very happily voted for it.

Short Stories: 
Man, look at that ballot.  I guess Ursula Vernon got a Nebula at least.

Graphic:
<i>Sex Criminals</i> got onto the ballot with 60 noms, <i>Nimona</i> was 11th with 28.  This is a category where your nomination makes a difference!

Dramatic Short:
Conventional wisdom is that there's more overlap between Puppies and others in the Dramatic categories - I myself voted for the Flash pilot even though it had been on the slate.  So it's a little hard to say what a Puppy-free ballot in this category might have looked like.  *However*, we know the top three got Puppy nominations, and ""Legend of Korra: the Last Stand"" came in 8th.  Was there a chance? Maybe, maybe not, I'm pleased it came so close.

Pro Artist:
Galen Dara would have made the ballot without the Puppies, sigh.

Fan Artist:
Elizabeth Leggett squeaked onto the ballot with 23 nominations and ran away with the category, somewhat similar to Sarah Webb last year iIrc.  Two of my nominees each got 16 nominations.  Another category where your nomination has a lot of power."

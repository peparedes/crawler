"event","Edgar - my adorable epileptic cat - got out of the house last night and hasn't come home. I've called the animal control officer in town and they gave us a trap to put outside the door and said to put a bowl of his food inside. That way, when he's hungry he'll go to eat the food and the trp door will shut.



I've also called the Worcester Animal Rescue League and if any cats are reported found at any shelter in the state, they'll notify me. They also told me to put an ad up on Craigslist and Petfinder.



Does anyone else have suggestions of what I should do?"

I got a call back from an electrician I contacted to replace 2 light fixtures in my bathroom. It is $100.00 an hour for labor with a one hour minimum. And yes, that IS American dollars, not Canadian.

By my conservative estimation, if this electrician works a normal work week of 40 hours per week, 50 weeks a year (we can assume he takes 2 weeks vacation and as he's self-employed doesn't get paid for that time) he grosses 4k a week, which totals...

$200,000.00 a year.

Celebrity Photographer Herb Ritts Dies

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Photographer Herb Ritts, whose access to celebrities, even at their most fragile moments, gave him an edge in the competitive field, died Thursday of complications of pneumonia, his publicist said. He was 50.

Ritts, whose pictures helped define the image-conscious 1980s and '90s, died at the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center, publicist Stephen Huvane said.

Ritts gained entree into celebrities' lives even when they displayed little glamour. He photographed Christopher Reeve, wired up and immobile in a high-tech wheelchair. In another photograph, Elizabeth Taylor sported a crew cut and the scar resulting from her brain surgery.

Ritts was born in Los Angeles in 1952, and moved to the East Coast to attend New York's Bard College, where he studied economics. He later returned to California and took a job as a sales representative for his family's furniture business.

Chance and connections propelled Ritts into the world of celebrity photography in the '70s. He got to know Richard Gere through someone who was dating the actor at the time.

A drive in the desert led to a flat tire and an impromptu photo session in a service station. The result was a photo of a steamy Gere in a white vest, his arms over his head and a cigarette dangling from his mouth.

""I can't remember whether I told Richard to put his arms over his head or whether I just clicked when he stretched. And he really smoked a lot. He was like that, a handsome kid and very sexy,"" Ritts said in an interview for a catalog that accompanied a show at Paris' Fondation Cartier in 2000.

At the time, Gere was an unknown. A year later he was a star, and Ritts' photos were being used as publicity shots.

Ritts shot celebrities from Madonna to Michelle Pfeiffer to Dizzy Gillespie for top fashion and culture magazines - Interview, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Elle. He took pictures for album covers and directed music videos.

His work was displayed at studios and museums including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

In 1991 two of his videos won MTV Awards: best female video, with Janet Jackson, and best male video, with Chris Isaak.

He is survived by his mother, Shirley Ritts; a brother, Rory; a sister, Christy; and his partner, Erik Hyman."

I'll check other people's pages from here and message people from this LJ in groups I belong to, but other than that check biglabor.blogspot.com for exciting tales of woe from the Institute.

I'd like to thank Wal-Mart, McDonalds, and George Bush for the creation of this LJ.  You won't be missed at all, and I'll probably rant about you soon in the new office.  Bitches.

All right.  One for the sun, organize_crime is done.

So I go up to ask for an application, and this is how it went down:

Counter Guy: So, what position are you applying for?

ME: I dunno.  What's open, off the top of your head.

"event","Masturbation is an act that probably came about through experimentation hundreds of thousands of years ago.  Many animals know how to masturbate, but rarely use it other than to mark territory or stave off depression.  I'd do more than some surface research (interesting articles about the masturbation habits can be found at the Kinsey Institute website...), but it's neither here nor there anyway.

Men's magazines exist, fundamentally, because of masturbation.  The pictures of the cute girls with little to nothing on make your dick hard, true, but cologne and clothing don't necessarily do that (unless you're one of the dudes from Queer Eye).  They seem to either A) provide filler as advertisements or B) they'll be a way to avoid having to jack off as much.  Get the girl by getting the job by getting the materials by working like a dog.  Maybe.

Black men's magazines are a bit behind in the way of understanding the nature of the advertising beast.  We want consciousness but big titties too.  Oh what to do.  

I think there's truly no contradiction to be found there.  Some people just love the look of huge boobs.  And then again, some really don't.  Some like legs, or butts, or arms, or a nice pair of feet.  Some just want some hair.  It truly is a matter of preference and tastes.  I think if you like to look at that stuff (and I think I've got some experience because hey, I love me some pr0n) you should enjoy it safely and within the boundaries of sanity and law.  But I don't think that your only reading material, ever, in reference to your masculinity, should be limited to some nudie pics and a couple of letters about threesomes.  But that's exactly what we have, and that's pretty much all that we ever buy.

In [i] Reefer Madness [/i], there was a section totally devoted to the propulgation of pornography.  We spend almost as much on defense spending as we do on pornography as a nation (this year we outstrapped our obsession with sex by half a trillion, and we'll go at least tens of billions over that soon if we're not careful) and yet, we have lots of laws against it.  Politicians rail and rally against the porn industry.  Leaders burn porn and make up archives for study (lol yeah, study...) to fight the industry.  But we love porn.  We love it more than we love ourselves.

But we'll fall for the trap, and that's what this whole business is betting on.  We love to see those naked parts, we just don't want to have to tell anyone.  So they offer ""discreet services"" and shit like that... your shame is fine as long as we can still make money.

Suggestions are welcome as to how to solve this problem.  I doubt we'll find any, but we're all more than welcome to try."

"event","A History of Violence was viewed tonight by myself and a few buddies.  Let me describe it this way:

Movies, to me, seem to hold four levels of violence as benchmarks for a movie's tenor:

1) Cartoony Violence - Examples:  Big Trouble in Little China, any Leslie Nielsen movie, etc.
Just your run of the mill action that is so overblown that it is intentionally funny.  You laugh a little, but probably don't watch the movie again (unless its Big Trouble in Little China).  Overall, it can be fun, just not that real.

2) Action Genre Violence - Examples: any Schwarzenegger flick, Bad Boys, Starship Troopers, etc.
It's real violence, but its clearly overblown for sheer effect.  The explosions and sounds used are generally mismatched, so the visual either has to do it or the sound has to do it.  If they're both bad, somehow you won't notice it.  But essentially, no analysis is really necessary.  Someone, anyone, is getting the shit beat out of them or blown out of them.  Your job is to watch, eat popcorn, and smile as the fake blood floods out of the bodies.

3) Realistic Metered Violence - Examples: Enter the Dragon, the first Rocky movie, etc.
The action seems real enough, and the people doing it are REALLY good at making it look alive and bloody.  Bruce Lee seemed to be different because his movements are punishing and exacting (torture, almost... the takes not woven in must be incredible).  His son Brandon was also the same kind of fighter.  His face gave a lot of his movements reality.  Fight Club has a different undertone of sadness to it.  The fights all had real purpose too, so you were emotionally invested in it all.  But underneath it, down below the good fucking brawling, is this sense that you're watching something that's choreographed.

4) Meatrack Knucklepucking Violence - Examples:  Donnie Brasco, Casino, Fight Club, etc.
I gave it such a fucked up name because this kind of violence comes from a violent place.  It's the kind of thing you see when two people fight in the street or that you see on hidden video tapes.  This brand of asskick just reeks of forbidden pleasure.  You laugh when you watch it because you know that it's not just what you'd expect to see when someone gets hit in the mouth, but you hope to GOD HIMSELF that you can produce that kind of look on someone's face when you get to hit them in the mouth.  Because the character in the movie looked like they were not only enjoying the hitting but enjoying the damage and destruction as well.  It's just all over the map... and you'd love to be the compass.  

A History of Violence really hits that fourth level, but in a way that just makes your mouth drop open.  It was an awe-inspiring movie because the realism was just unbelievable, yet believable.  I recommend it to anyone looking to see someone get ""throated.""  And yes, that's a word now.  We made it up, Viggo Mortensen did it, and all we could say is ""Whoa."""

"event","First of all, Talcott is a town completely cut off from civilization.  The nearest cellular phone signal is 30 miles away, and even if you do get up that far I can guarantee you that you're going to be disappointed.  It was like talking into a coffee can that cost more than my PS2. Thankfully my roaming charges no longer apply because I got the international plan, so I didn't even have to feel guilty making phone calls from the mountains.

The family camp site has been completely overhauled since the first time I was at the camp.  The kitchen has been redone as well as the bedrooms.  The boats and pictures though... Man, it was like a wayback machine in the living room.  My greatgrandfather's pictures were stunning, and each relative has expanded on the pictoral family tree so that now, for the first time since the taking of the pictures, we know what many of my relatives born since 1850 look like.  It really made me feel privileged to see my relatives, dressed up and not smiling at all (that's always struck me as funny) in grainy black and white photographs.

But perhaps most important, it's really quiet up there.  In fact, I'd argue that it's a little creepy how quiet it is up there.  I read three books and watched an entire football game without passing out to sleep, although the Philadelphia game was one I just couldn't stay awake for.

All in all, the cabin and surrounding campsite is officially the doper than dope.  Someday the cousins will inherit it, and we'll all have to take care of it."

As I come to the end of my waiting period, I find that I've moved farther past scared or confused or even nervous.  Now I've come to a weird holding pattern reminiscent of Sartre... My eyes appear intense and even a little menacing.  In my usual intellectual conversations, I'm now a deep shade of Don't Fuck With Me... some people completely avoid my eyes all together.  My mother is giving me the widest berth, aware that I'm completely compressed down to the last kb.  The tension makes my teeth throb, and I can't understand for the life of me why sleep so successfully evades me when I'm just so close.

I've got other options, all of them fun jobs with no responsibility.  Some of them, dare I say it, might even be a little freeing.  But I don't want them.  I'll take them, don't get me wrong.  But I want this job.

Mom showed up last night pretty late.  I was already asleep on the downstairs couch.

The first thing she asked about was the job interviews, and my response was truthful.  That truth clearly pissed her off and she stormed upstairs.  Apparently now we're going to spend Saturday talking about it since we both need to get our cars fixed.  I think its cool that she wants to talk, but I'm not exactly sure what the conversation will be like.  I mean, I'm her son so I have a pretty good idea that it won't be a good one, but I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt.  

Things must change, though, and I think that the positive ramifications of this job can be an important step on the way to that change.  I imagine that she disagrees, but I think that at this point we'll just have to wait it out until Saturday to know for sure.  hehe.... nervous yet?

Still waiting to know if anything will even happen, but my references have all called me back saying how enthusiastic and happy my interviewer was.  I sit waiting by my cell phone, anxious to know the deal.

Interview with the county tomorrow about picking up trash on the freeway.  Doesn't that sound just awesome (I'm actually not kidding... it would be nice to be outside all day)?"

If waiting was cheese, I'd definitely be drowning in gouda.  


This morning I had the distinct pleasure of watching a girl in my Psych 101 class pick her nose for thirty minutes.  As she began to dig farther, possibly drawing blood, I began to daydream.

Oh, the things I could do if I was employed in organizing again... 

The bell rang, we left, I got back into the car.  My phone rang as soon as I put my key into the door, and BANG...

It was a local number, but one I didn't recognize.

I took a deep breath.  My lungs expanded, and with it my mind blew outward like a pair of fresh-off-a-big-girl's-ass bloomers... 

I saw Friday nights at Clyde's uproariously return, Peppermint Patties and songstresses on nights with girls.  

I saw new suits, charcoal black and dark gray with matching ties.  Finally, some tailored threads and shoes that fit.

I saw payback for school fees and a little extra to take Mom to the movies and apologize.  I haven't been doing my job.

And I saw, most of all, rent money.  Finally, out of this damn house.  For good.  For a long time.  Till she moves on, then sometime I'll come back and look at it and laugh.

I answered the third ring.  It wasn't who I wanted.  But another job.  I took the 9 AM interview.  

Letter to God:
This year has been trying on my patience, my career mind, and my ability to support myself.  Very few times in my life have I prayed out of selfishness and most of the time when I pray I wonder if it even matters.  Today, just today, I need it to matter.  I don't just want this job, I MUST HAVE this job.  Mobilizing was my shining acheivement in my organizing career.  To not continue, two miles from my house, would feel damningly evident of my inability to continue as an organizer.  If I don't get this gig, I'm really going to consider my ability as an organizer to be completely gone and I'll stop.  Just tell me to stop if you don't think I can.  I'll take the job as a gardener and be glad for that.  Really, I will, just don't give me my drive and lust for organizing back just to nail me to a cross with it two miles from home.  But you know best, and I trust you.

So I took a break and hit Lake Whetstone for sitdown.

I don't often get this deep in my journal because my honesty isn't something I particularly enjoy sharing with the entire Internet.  But I think seeing this on my page may help my mind somehow, someway.

I'm hoping I get this job because for the longest time I haven't wanted to do anything associated with organizing.  I've been vocal on the Internet about my feelings about raiding and its effect on the AFL and CTW, and lately I've been wondering whether that was wise.  

Today at the lake there was a guy mowing the grass.  He looked really tired and had been eyeing my bottle of water enviously.  I had three more in the car, so I told myself that if I was that thirsty I could always walk back to the car and handed out what I had.  One dude, Mario, took a break and sat down with me.  He talked about his wife, a recently minted UNITE HERE union member, very little.

The benefits he gets from AFSCME, the union that represents county employees, are plentiful.  He's got 80/20 insurance, something that he opted for instead of 95/5 because it meant some extra money every month.  His kids, Maricella and Antonio, will enter 2nd and 1st grade respectively this year.  They've been excited to hit elementary school and really enjoy recess, but dislike math and english (non-respective.)  He's glad they've got a place to play that doesn't involve video games and/or television.  The MV membership stuff eats up that extra 20 a month he got from work, but he's happy to see them row boats and play around the ducks.  He's got Montgomery College on his mind for the future, but he's not sure what he wants to major in.  It's been a long time since he's seen the inside of a textbook, but he thinks he would get a kick out of history or maybe computers.  He eyed my sandwich too, so we split the rest of that and ate in a knowing silence.  Break over, he grimaced and took off to the other side of the pond.  I ate Sun Chips in front of the water.  

It's been a good day.  Let's hope we hear more tomorrow."

"event","I do The Work.

Racism, in all of its profound glory as a monument to man's ineptitude at seeing the equality of all, is not something that everyone can know.  In fact, most people go their whole lives trying to define it and make it real for other people who haven't experienced it.  Our grandparents and their parents struggled under it as a openly regulated system, with their parents experiencing it as a nightmare realized through violence, death, lies, and miseducation.  But through it all, as their children we have the responsibility to make sure that we strive to be better and do better despite its crushing and debilitating existence.  But for the most part we don't.  We carve our small niches here and there in an attempt to secure a foundation for the next generation's youth, but mostly we just succeed in making ourselves less educated, less thoughtful, and less healthy than those who came before us.  As human beings we often fail, myself definitely included sometimes.

And that's why I do The Work.  

I organize (and have organized) because I figure that, in some small way my contributions to the health and welfare of people who are working poverty line jobs or are lacking in health care will make a dent.  Organizers work in extreme conditions, leave their families behind for months, (sometimes years) at a time, work while sick (and not *cough cough* sick, but hospitalized from near-fatal exhaustion sick,) give up their entire LIFE for the singular cause of improving the planet in a constructive, focused, non-partisan way.  Organizers do it because the work demands what the people demand: social justice.

So I have to ask:  do any of you do The Work?  Do you toil in a way that is somehow unconnected to your church, your family, or your wallet?  Is there something, anything, that drives you enough to leave your home and travel to places so dangerous that you're told by those who live there that you are in ""eminent danger?""  Do you do This Work willingly, without promises of eternal reward, hints of fortune, or even thanks?  

If you don't, I honestly question your ability to say anything but ""How about those Redskins last night?"" when you see me, because perhaps you DON'T see me.  I don't expect people to know what I do or how I do it, but I do expect people to not assume that they know.  I'm not righteous, I make mistakes, I am human.  But I'm not a guy who's not trying.  If you want evidence I'll give you copy of my resume.

But on a harder note, don't fuck with me and expect me to be nice.  I've brought two universities to their knees, I took on the state of Mississippi when all the other kids refused to show some balls and sign up, and local union presidents respect me not because I smiled in their face but because I earned it through hard work and a backbone, so it shouldn't be a surprise that if I have to whip someone's ass my checks don't bounce.  I'm not afraid of anyone, especially not some cats playing on the intarW3b with mommy and daddy's Verizon account.

But then again, if you're foolish enough to try me my words may not mean much.

In Constant Gardener, one of my favorite scenes was when the protagonist made the linkage between the company that was doing harm and his wife's obsession with their actions.  As an activist, his wife was often a part of internationally risky situations.  She was impertinent, giving no ground to any of her much richer and more powerful opponents.  That obsession ultimately brought an end to her life, but for him it was a bit of a reach.  He couldn't honestly understand why such a rich girl would give so much of her time to something that seemed so fruitless.  But in the end he seemed to get the point: sometimes things are so wrong that you can't do anything but the right thing, even when it costs you a fortune unearnable.  And regardless of how many plants you place in the ground, if the soil is raw and turned sick, those flowers are merely cannon fodder."

"event","Jesus was a huge fan of the poor. In fact, so much so that he was a poor man himself when made human. In every version of the Bible, both ancient language and current conversions, the scene with the temple full of bankers and moneychangers is actually one of the only ones that has survived as an account unquestioned by contemporary scholars.

Most conservatives consider moral values a part of their dictum. And most of the time that's a dictum that includes religion as a kind of moral pH. Now, while this pH test may not be used for everyone, it is quite common. 

I think what Jesus has to say about money is always, regardless of what passage you use, clear: money, while useful for survival, can't make a life. Only the joy of giving to others is what can make your soul something that will stand up to God's eternal example, Jesus Christ. 

Just because you give money when there's a disaster doesn't make you a giving person. Money really only goes so far, and what ultimately needs to be given but usually isn't is compassion. I've seen very little compassion this year from conservatives in the government as well as in the general populace. Most of what I've seen in the forum as well as in the world at large is a kind of disdain for the poor unless they are directly in front of those same poor people. They blame them, saying that they are victims of their own misdeeds and bad decisions.

Often I'm called to think of Elijah Muhammad's analogy about water tainted by ink, and that when a man is thirsty he will drink that tainted water because his choice is thirst or no thirst. Now, given a clean glass with pure water and that dirty glass of inky bile, he will drink from the clean glass with pure water. But only if he is thirsty.

I think a lot of the people that I have met in my time in New Orleans, Biloxi, Corinth, Olive Branch, etc. have been folks that are just in need of some clean, clear water to drink, metaphorically speaking. I find that I'm lacking all the time in my efforts to help, and for the most part I try to shore up those obstacles by helping. But I do that NOT JUST WHEN THERE IS A DISASTER.

THAT, for ME, is the biggest indictment of the rich and powerful, especially those who are those things and ""conservative."" When the chips are down, it is truly nice to see people donating time and money. But what about the other times? 

What about not fighting organizing efforts that are perfectly legal for those who make minimum wage, so that they can afford prescription medicine and doctor's visits instead of trying to self-medicate (which incidentally is also linked to 
occurances of mental illness)?

What about raising minimum wage so that those who work those jobs can live well enough to have good employment records, move when there is a disaster, and avoid getting sick from substandard food and dwellings?

What about fighting FOR funding for improving upon the way we educate children so that they can go beyond the economic stratum placed upon them at birth and ultimately make their own lives better?"

That disaster did not cause looting, people caused looting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



And guns don't kill people, people kill people, according to some. But guns have bullets. And while those bullets are not responsible for the trigger, they do cause the injury sustained. So why is it that we don't throw people in jail and through the miraculous healing of justice someone is in turn completely cured when the guilty party is prosecuted? Because fundamentally we still have to repair the damage the gun and its fodder, the bullets, have caused. The violence could come from another direction and still has a primary (or secondary, depending on your choice of prima facie investigation) source, but we're still talking, simple and plain, a gunshot wound. Not to say that the gun is the primary cause, but A cause (one of many, in fact.) Its level is not the same as the person's culpability, but definitely holds true to form as a contributor to injury. 

Your analogy then only holds so much weight with the disaster argument. Both indeed are causes, but to say that they are not dependant on one another is like saying that cholesterol didn't contribute to a man's heart attack or that pollen doesn't make me sneeze. The truth lies in that the causes are neither independant nor weighted. They're BOTH part of the same conclusion: poor people who were already struggling to begin with ultimately losing all assets and becoming overtly destitute in a concentrated, polluted area. Which leads to another statement made:


Quote:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I beat my wife, the devil made me do it, I rape your sister, the disaster made me do it. Sorry, I do not buy the bleading heart liberal montra at all. Everything I have done in my life, good and bad, are because of CHOICES I have made. None of my choices were the results of a disaster, the devil, society. I made the choices, and those who looted made the choices. No one FORCED them to loot. They were not at the point of starvation, they were being challenged for the first time in many of their lives, challenged to be human beings, they were challenged to actually TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



A blanket characterization appears here that is troubling. The they in this argument has been molded out of a disturbing model: the welfare queen and/or drug dealer and/or pimp and/or king of the block. To save myself some time, I'm going to repost something that I put up earlier. I think it relates better to our conversation and its something I wish to reference later on.

The human body's systems are dependant on multiple chemicals, nutrients, and solvents to make it function. These vital fluids are determined by the brain to be necessary for survival unless told otherwise. Our bodies, not unlike car engines, run slower and operate at a diminished capacity when unable to find sufficient fuel.

So when people riot, doctors are never called to report on the situation. Why? Because doctors would say that the desire to loot, to find food or water, or whatever the media is calling it is COMPLETELY NATURAL. The human body does anything it can to ensure its own survival. That's why people are known to flee with an almost supernatural sense of eminent danger, exhibit feats of strength that they previously have never shown prior to the extraordinary event, and in times of strife tend to go a little crazy.

In New Orleans, there are five plants that are part of a union I worked for some months ago. Those plants printed all sorts of magazines and newspapers and used a chemical called toluene as a solvent. This chemical is a carcinogen and a level four risk as a hazardous material. It is volatile, so much so that if you filled a coke bottle with it and shook it for a good one or two minutes, you would probably be covered in flames or fatally burned from the blast. In an emergency, MTs of five are called to turn off the pumps, evacuate the facility, and decide who is going to remain because if there's a breach as much as square mile could be incinerated by the amounts in most printing facilities of medium size.

All of the plants I know of were affected by the disaster. And this toluene is now in the water all over town. It is also on fire, and residents have reported coughing and contamination-related symptoms. Now, going back to our previous analogies, this isn't a simple ""toluene made people crazy"" suggestion. This problem is one of many contamination problems that are now a serious ecological threat. But the contamination also adds to the myriad of reasons why a group of poor people would decide to lash out at aid workers and soldiers trying to save their lives: the events have driven people mad. The overarching conclusion and truth has to be this then:

The current survivors of the disaster are screwed up by the unfolding events. They are probably not going to be well for a long time, and before they were unhinged in this way they were poor and that ALONE can make you crazy if it is the level of poverty that is known of in Ward 9. We're now reaping the benefits of being a society with wealth in that we're alive, but we're experiencing the inverse of that when poor people get angry: our wealth and pleasure penultimately contributed to their hungry and thirsty madness. And we're fundamentally screwed if we don't address it in a healthy way.

The poor people that you describe as animals are typically people who work blue-collar jobs. Plants in NOLA actually have great attendance records, make award winning products, and generally have employees who work hard. There are also people who work in stores like Wal-Mart, KMart, Piggly Wiggly, etc. All of these people in these places make much less than your average white-collar person and live in an area that takes economic advantage of that. As a result, people live paycheck to paycheck. 

There are definitely people who take advantage of the system, but they are fundamentally few and far between. We see more of them because it is much ""sexier"", but being a person who has to compile the statistics out of the field and then go into the worst neighborhoods in the United States to try and help these people, I must fundmentally disagree with the idea that they are animals in search of a handout or a victim. For the most part, they don't have the money to move and are terrified that they will lose all the headway they have made against their own economic situation. Add to that a chemically induced high from the air and water full of toxins and a desire to get some nourishment, and you'll get a lot of angry broke people with nothing left to lose.

"event","So I've got these cheeseburgers... haha just playin.

Thursdays are always great because until Saturday I usually forget that I even have an Internet connection, so I figured I'd make this ""alles klar"" post before embarking on the voyage.

I was up late last night playing well with the other children (MATT DAYMEN!)



I got an email from a few friends at Georgetown who are currently doing a study on St. Maarten and the current political climate of Caribbean nations.  St. Maarten/St. Martin is currently trying to revitalize its economy since the hurricanes have been so merciless.

""We were wondering what you thought about its relationship with the United States since you spent so much time there.  Also, what do you think about their continuously recanted and then reasserted support of the war, especially since in many ways they are still a French/Dutch colony?""

There's these dope green monkeys on the island that will follow your car for miles.  Sometimes they throw fruit or shit, but only because they aren't used to favorable interaction with tourists.  Mostly they just watch you from the street, hoping to catch a glimpse of you so they can alert the other ones to get out of the road.  Monkeys are neat.

The island itself is pretty much at the political mercy of whatever international superpower visits them the most.  I can remember a time when Desert Storm (or maybe it was still Desert Shield at that point) and my cousin went to Iraq, where he spent most of his time on munitions shit (I rarely understand what he does during the day, although I have to say that it mostly just involves his graduate major, chemistry).  He told me that the soldiers came back tired and that a lot of what he worked on, what we now know is a derivative of Agent Orange, injured many soldiers on both sides.  He described 115 degree heat, melting his boots.  And he also told me many times about how much he hates, as he put it, ""sand niggers.""  Now, St. Maarten/Martin as a collective island is pretty diverse in its international citizenry.  But on the dutch side, St. Maarten, there's a fairly large contingent of Muslims from Pakistan, India, Iran, Iraq, Syria, etc.  And they support the local economy so well that most of Philipsburg is dependent upon them for its survival during the summer months, when the economy slows.  So for at least half the year, in St. Maarten, ""sand niggers"" run the show.

The debate about the war, at least at this point, has become rather moot.  We're in there, neck deep.  So for the residents of that island they're just as in as everyone else.  But because its a small island, completely dependant on its beautiful beaches, liquor, and tanned rich women and medical students, you can see how uneasy the huge political rigamarole is.  I mean, after all, we're just a bunch of hedonistic freaks to most of them anyway.  While the prostitution trade on the island can pretty much assure you the girl of your dreams for one thousand dollars a night, most girls are fairly devout Christians if they are island natives.

I asked a friend or two of mine from there to give me some insight.  

""So the political establishment there, at least those who make actual decisions, are in a tough spot:  these soldiers that park their boats near our shores, enjoy our island nightlife, and actually aren't too loud or mean or crazy are not exactly a burden on our island.  They are great for our economy.  Some of them married our local women or men, and some of them mean a lot to our own families.  It's a small island, and a lot of us are indirectly related here.  But in the inverse, we're an island of poltical refugees.  Many of our people that are now citizens of St. Maarten are definitely not natives.  Many of them came from the same countries that are currently being invaded, and by supporting the war in some ways we support those who fled Saddam's reign.  But some of them have also left family there, most of whom are now either impoverished or in the process of fleeing the country.

""So what do we do?  If we support your stay, Reece, we stand the chance of losing a lot of our economic partners.  The island depends upon a lot of the trade in Front Street for its ability to function as a cohesive trade market.  Nevermind the fact that many of us bought our wives their wedding rings, bought presents for our daughters and sons for christmas, graduation, and birthdays there, so losing those businesses would also leave a little something in our memory behind.

""But if we don't, surely even more people will die and the economy will most likely get worse anyway.  Consider it from an international perspective, and you'll see that most of our impotence is based upon a stark inability to choose between what will mostly likely impoverish us and will most likely kill other people.

""But we CAN say that we are not in support of the start of this war.  We say that because we are not in support of the start of anything that leaves us, your friends, with no options.  While it was your decision (yes, yours Reece) to start the war, it is up to everyone to pay for it.  I indict you and your country for trying to take the process away from me even though you want me to help you.  I don't like the fact that you, Reece, say you do not support the war, yet you say yourself that you have driven yourself to job interviews for the past three weeks in a car with poor gas mileage.  I don't like that you, an American, considers yourself that much of an impact while instead of taking the buses that run on natural gas in your country, you drive your Buick.  What can I say to a man that thinks himself a scholar when he behaves as a fool, even though I do the same as he does:  the best he can?  I say that you yourself must make a choice as to what you think your life means and what your decisions mean for others."""

"event","Today was brought to you by the letters W, H, O, and A.

My classes are early in the morning this semester so I went in to look for books... wanted to see how much they cost.  Naked materialism rose immediately from my skin, since by that point I was also wondering how much a Montgomery College bag would cost so I could look as goofy as I felt.  HAHA... School?  For me?  No thanks.  Last time it repeated on me, leaving my shirt covered in that cartoony green and orange vomit (is that shit carrots or something... never could figure that out... maybe yams lol)

Small wonder that I also decided to visit a professor and try for some counselling.

Her first glance at my transcript produced some horror.  She asked me why I dropped so many classes.  ""I was asked to for some... others I left voluntarily after angry quarrels with professors.""  She recommended that I take things very slowly and not take too many classes this semester.  Then, next semester, go for a full time load if I think I like where things are going.

Financial aid, back to the bookstore, etc.

Interview was great.  Test next week, after courses pan out.

At some point, I'm ordering Wu-Chronicles.  That shit looks dope."

When I worked for the Library of Congress, she was on the same train I was on.  My headphones were playing Bilal, and she walked to the beat of Soul Sista.  She had great bone structure and a beautiful face with a tiny bit of makeup on.  Her eyes were green with gold flecks and her hair was blown out like Pam Grier's in Cofee.  Her dress was a wine burgundy with sandals that matched the hem.  Her legs were solid masses of muscle, calves oiled up hours before since by that point they had become a little less shiny from all the running and exhaust.  Oh, and she was black.  Not black like me, or even Black Like Me, but black like Ukrainian soil.  Her oiled black hair made her skin shimmer in the Metro lights.  What's funny about her is that some people noticed her and some really didn't.  The guy next to me had been talking about politics with me for a few minutes, but he began to stammer when she walked on.  When she sat down, he laughed and said, ""I'm glad we can't smell her from here... I'd probably have to get off at Dupont with you.""  

Personally, she reminded me of pictures I saw of Zaire.  Not the women, but the mountains or the small creeks... the heat that's actually visible... the nightime sky.     

But I never saw her again after that.  Most of the time now, when I get on the Metro, I feel like I'm fighting the urge to stare at the entrance to the train, mostly out of fear that the one time I do I'll indirectly stare someone down.  Silly, I know, but it's still out there for me.  And since the Library of Congress job was the best internship I ever had, it probably just solidifies how great I imagine she was.  Just goes to show you how quickly life can take you past what you're looking for into what you THINK you want.

This post is for those girls in our life, or rather, passing through our life.  Its for the women that capture your attention for a brief moment, moving unscripted.  For the ladies that you see and imagine fighting with over the last bit of peanut butter in your flat in Greece.    That you imagine probably clip their toenails over a trashcan in the bathroom while talking to you on the phone, make pasta that you must eat when anticipating the arrival of their parents but won't even eat what you cook when your parents show up, and can't stand your Slum Village remixes.  They're perfect, but only for you.  Other guys might not be into them.  Other guys might not even notice them as they walk past you, but all that really matters that you do.

This post is also for the guys who know these women.  For the underdogs with the Caddies that smoke that Mustang every single time, even though they really should have lost.  For the hopeless romantics, without (or with) the romance.  For the guys who read shaky poetry at the cafe about them, only to find out that most people think its about a fish or some strange obsession with Zaire.  And, although this probably includes just about everybody, this is for those guys who know there's nothing quite like seeing someone who makes your mind travel through time to your best days on your worst days.

To those who found them, kudos.  To those who lost them, condolences.  To those who are steadily waiting for them to board the train, there's always tomorrow."

I have no sympathy for the war or for Bush or any other politician. It's true that they can send other people's kids into fight because that's a part of how our government works.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<lj-cut>

While definitely true that right now our government can take volunteers and use them as they see fit, historically this is a pretty recent development. Conscription for the purposes of war is usually mandatory in countries that are not democratic and a draft actually was part of it until it was suspended due to the political minefield that was Vietnam. Now, while not necessarily a bad thing (that it was suspended), the Draft was at least somewhat of a way to level the playing field. If you weren't rich enough or powerful enough to get out of it, you'd have to go. A lot of today's senators and other assorted politicians were members of those units that served as draftees, so obviously many of them are not fans of a draft. So it shouldn't surprise anyone that when a draft came up, it didn't pass. 

But why have they approved, either in committee or general vote, increased advertising expenditures for recruitment? Why have they built multimillion dollar recruitment centers in rapid time in the poorest of areas (Baltimore has one that looks like a gigantic shopping mall... and it's in the center of the Market Square area, which is home to lots of the city's recovering addicts and working poor) and made commercials showing people how to talk to their relatives about ""accepting their sacrifice as one that is necessary to our liberties?"" I think, and so would anyone who read and watched these ads, that they're desperate. They are seeing people who usually would cheer their sons' and daughters' entry into service turn their children away because they are frightened that their children won't come back alive. And the worst part for most of the recruiters and congressmen and other political figures is that when it comes to the lives of their own kids they AGREE.

Quote:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But since I had no say in going to war and nothing I could have said would have stopped it, I have to accept it in so far as I'll support our troops and anything they do because to do otherwise is the same as telling them that they are chumps and stupid to be where they are. I know they are not either of those things. They are for the most part, fine men and women and I can't denigrate their sacrifice by making a mockery of what they do, while being back here where I'm not being shot at.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To address your second statement, I have to tell you that I agree that we should support the troops, but I don't think that accepting what they are being told to do is responsible or respectful. In fact, I think that by reducing them to pawns in a war that we accept yet somehow don't have ""any control over"" is the real way that we call them ""stupid or chumps."" What it ultimately comes down to, again, is what you think patriotism is. Patriotism, according to our own Constitution, is not sitting back and waiting for someone to tell us what to do. As citizens in a democracy, we do have representatives who help facilitate the process, but our penultimate role is Big Boss Man. We tell those guys, no matter how rich and powerful they think they are, what to do. And when we don't, we run the risk of doing our country a disservice. When they lie and we let them lie, we are cheating ourselves as well as the kids that we sent overseas. 

You're right, those kids trust us to take care of them and appreciate their sacrifice. But appreciation of any gift requires the full and appropriate usage of that gift, which right now we are definitely not doing. By asking people who are trusting us with their lives to violate international law, psychologically harm citizens of a nation that we are supposedly helping, and betray our allies that are also in the field right alongside them, we're endangering them and disrespecting them at the same time.

Her protests won't end the fighting. If it would, we would all go out and protest. Even if it did end it at the time, it will come back after us another day. The inevitable will happen, regardless of what we do in the meantime.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



You've got that backwards. Her protests alone won't end the fighting. If we all went out and protested together, it would end, because you can't silence everyone. The inevitable will most certainly happen if WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL regardless of what we do in the meantime.

Throughout history, protest has stopped tanks, gave me the right to exist as an black man, allowed Christians all over the world to read the Bible in their own language as opposed to listening to a priest read it in Latin, gave women the right to vote, stopped a war, ended lynchings as legal resolution to conflict.. the list goes on and on. But we as people have decided to not believe in it as a salve for the inequality of our system because those that have money to buy airtime told us it was pointless. It may seem hopeless right now, but that's what people WANT you to believe. In truth, there's more evidence now more than ever that we're at a tipping point in terms of socioeconomic and political change. But the proof of this pudding lies with us. If WE don't act, nothing will get done.

Was her son better or more important than those still facing death every hour of every day?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



No one is more important than another, but I don't think that she's calling for answers just for her son. I think that the answer that she could have gotten from GW was probably one applicable to all. But I think you should direct those questions to those who haven't had to sacrifice their children to the war machine because its obvious that they don't value any soldier's life if they'll send them out on falsehoods.

Or we can give up and let the terrorists of the world take over. At least I'm inclined to fight for our way of life the best way I can, as imperfect as it is. It's far better than a life under Islam.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Islam is a lot like Christianity. Imagine if someone in Iran said the same thing about Christianity. The first question you'd have is ""Why? What have I done?"" because most likely, at least in the US, you're of that particular faith. But then, the second question, which is most important, is ""Which Christianity?"" Within Islam, there's a heap of different sects and branches. Some of them, like the insanely orthodox (or unorthodox, depending on your division) Islam that is practiced by terrorists, aren't even endorsed by clerics because they usually are in violation of doctrine (the 9/11 attackers, for example, wore cologne and went to strip clubs, which breaks tons of Islamic rules.) Then there's Sufism, which is a kind of ecstatic Islam that's not too far from being parallel to a Baptist (there's a lot of great Sufi poetry... try Rumi or Shams if you're interested... I'll throw you a link if you want one). Then there's the ones in the middle - Sunni, Shia, - and the ones that want to be a part of the faith but aren't yet considered true Islam, whatever that means, - Nation of Islam, Five Percenters, etc. With all those different sects, you know what they say when someone asks them who they are? They say, ""I'm Muslim,"" just like a Presbyterian and a Baptist would say they're ""Christians."" But Christians do bad things, just like Muslims, yet no one in the US is declaring a moratorium on hiring Christian professors or closing universities that are faith based. We're also not deporting Seventh Day Adventists because of David Koresh or imprisoning Pat Robertson. 

I'd argue that we do these things, just the same as why we villify anyone, because they are different than what they're used to seeing in the roads or on the streets. But if we're smart, we'll recognize the beauty in our differences and recognize the human potential in each person."

"event","This entire topic reminds me of one class where the professor told a story about a man he met on the bus a few years prior. 

The man had lost his son the previous year to cancer and after long battles and stays in the hospital, his son's body just gave out. He said his boy had lots of mental fight, but sometimes the body just can't support it. When he died, he and his wife moved to a new house, unable to sleep in the same place. They felt haunted by their own grief. Eventually the marriage ended, and the man was now moving on to a new city where he had some old college friends. He showed my professor a picture, and he literally gasped in horror at the sight of a man that looked at least thirty years younger than the man he met on the bus. The child, a ten year old boy, was using braces to walk and had a big smile on his face. I raised my hand and asked if he remains in contact with him, and my prof said sadly no. He did offer the man prayer which he politely refused, saying that he felt abandoned by God. 'Teach said he understood and moved on, but he remembers the last thing the guy said before they went their separate ways, ""I wish I could ask God why.""

<lj-cut>

George Bush didn't kill her child. Neither did God, really. Someone, somewhere gave an order to do so. But the fact remains that Bush sent lots of other people's children somewhere to fight a war that he has no intention of personally sacrificing for. At no point will Bush EVER send his own children, because I know that he believes that they are the most important thing in his life and that losing them would certainly destroy him and his wife. But he also wants to see them grow and marry and have kids of their own. And that is certainly more important than whatever he thinks he's fighting for over there, because if he really thought it was that important he'd send them. So a mom, who has lost her child, changed her mind about how she felt while meeting the man she thought would answer her concerns. Maybe she did some reading. Maybe in her search for answers she read commentary from different political figures, conservative and liberal, who think that the decisions made were dangerous. Or maybe she just thought about it while she wasn't so broken up about her child and decided to take action while she felt composed enough to respond but still sad enough to cry. 

In the Revolutionary War, there are lots of stories of children fighting alongside fathers and brothers arming siblings for battle. Kids lied about their age so they could be conscripted. It was a war of passionate belief, and while it was also a war that had plenty of people who disagreed with its fundamental tenets and did prove to be controversial for its time, there was a tenor of singularity present that allowed for people to understand its motives and desires as ones that were essential to freedom. 

This war, however, is clearly about corporate division, profit margins, and basically just doing favors for friends and family of those in power. The reasons have been baseless and false, the preparations hasty and clouded with denial of informational access, and the overall justification patriarchal and divisive. People may not agree about whether we should stay or go, but the facts clearly point to falsehood when it comes to whether or not this war was righteous or legal.

Other moms have come out in favor of the war even after their children died or were wounded. But a lot of them aren't, and while I don't think the opinions of those moms who do come out are invalid I do think that despite their opinion of the war they'd rather have a live son and no war than a dead one. That, my friend, is what aligns those parents together and is why a conservative man, who voted for Bush, volunteered his own space for protestors to sleep. He might enjoy the press, but as a veteran I'm sure he knew that when he went home, his family was happy to see him. And that's worth 1000 Iraqs, dude."

"event","I posted an info chart on Iraq, running down some facts I found interesting. The first time I was introduced to that list, I was taking part in a debate between pro and anti war students. Some were in ROTC on the conservative side, some were getting into it for the first time, and on the other side were just interested students and some staff. I used it, and after reading it aloud, both sides issued their displeasure with my reading it. In fact, every time I've told someone about it they've said the same thing: What does that matter?
Why is that relevant? 

<lj-cut>

The reason it is relevant is the same reason why Cindy Sheehan is camped out in Texas: truth and facts are important when you are discussing something of great importance, especially when you're making a decision. 

Most of the people that I was on the panel with graduated, most going into the military to serve. In a war where the forward areas are claiming lots of lives, it shouldn't surprise anyone that a lot of these kids that I knew have either been injured or killed. 

Their parents are not crybabies. My friends are not crybabies. No one who wants to mourn the loss of their family, blood or spiritual, should be told that they are complaining. The issue of whether or not life is tough is irrelevant and selfish, regardless of who asks. Loss is loss, and just because someone with no human stake in the war sees it as an acceptable fate doesn't mean that other people do, and asking why they died does not mean that they seek the country's destruction. Assertion of anything to the contrary is cruel, mean, and unacceptable.

What IS acceptable is a search for answers that isn't stymied by those in power. Mothers who want answers shouldn't be ridiculed because they desire resolution. Ultimately we should be asking what's wrong with US if we can't understand why it's going on and are unwilling to ask. 

In my life, I want to be considered a radical. I say radical because the Latin meaning defines radicals as those who seek the root of the problem or cause. Radicals are often in danger because truth is, in many different ways, expensive. In fact, most would say that it is worth a life. People also say that radicals are dangerous, and I agree. But what I don't agree with is labelling any dangerous fool a radical. True radicals accept no answer as definitively true without study, leaving most of them to spend their lives questioning everything, living in uncertainty. But in that uncertainty I think there's pleasure in knowing the truth, and that for me is what's most important.

To tie things all together, we as a society are trained to be afraid of the truth. Our government has a vested interest, at this point, in keeping us this way. The system, democracy, goes right against this trend in the way that systems are supposed to: just by existing, democracy gives us a choice. 

So given the information available, you have a choice to make. Are you going to question what you're being told and use actual reason and logic to make a decision? Or will you blindly follow along? And the kicker is that by making this choice, you ultimately are deciding whether or not you are truly a good democratic citizen. Our founding fathers were patriots and citizens in the truest sense: they believed in being a true radical and using rebellion and dissent as a democratic tool, not supressing it. But they also knew the value of leadership and the relationship required in order for leadership to be truly valuable. But, most importantly, they wrote down what they thought and left it to be read, changed or destroyed as we saw fit because true freedom and democracy is shaped and molded to fit the container that is the governed population."

<quote> ""Sensenbrenner is your basic Fat Evil Prick, perfectly cast as a dictatorial committee chairman: He has the requisite moist-with-sweat pink neck, the dour expression, the penchant for pointless bile and vengefulness. Only a month before, on June 10th, Sensenbrenner suddenly decided he'd heard enough during a Judiciary Committee hearing on the Patriot Act and went completely Tasmanian devil on a group of Democratic witnesses who had come to share stories of abuses at places like Guantanamo Bay. Apparently not wanting to hear any of that stuff, Sensenbrenner got up midmeeting and killed the lights, turned off the microphones and shut down the C-Span feed, before marching his fellow Republicans out of the room -- leaving the Democrats and their witnesses in the dark.

This lights-out technique was actually pioneered by another Republican, former Commerce Committee chairman Thomas Bliley, who in 1995 hit the lights on a roomful of senior citizens who had come to protest Newt Gingrich's Medicare plan. Bliley, however, went one step further than Sensenbrenner, ordering Capitol police to arrest the old folks when they refused to move. Sensenbrenner might have tried the same thing in his outburst, except that his party had just voted to underfund the Capitol police."" </quote>

"event","So I had an interview with some guys from a union a few weeks ago.  The meeting itself was pretty negative, and I wouldn't expect to hear from them... except...

I got an email from the organizing director's girlfriend this morning.

Asking me if I would be interested in working for the union she works for.

But here's the thing...

other locals in this union have told me that my name has been thrown to selected locals in the midwest and farwest.  All the East Coast locals have, one by one, interviewed me.  Most haven't rejected me.  Except for this particular.

Now, here's what I'm wondering when I get the email:

Does he really know that his girlfriend is going after me as a new hire?  Or did she, like most of the other locals, pick my email up off of a list on the AFL website?  OR, unlike the others, did she pick my resume off of his desk?  Does she know that he hasn't called me back?  Is THIS my returned phone call?"

"event","I'm gonna start writing late night posts before I go to sleep.  I get ideas this time of day.


I haven't worked for six weeks.  At first it felt okay.  Apply for unemployment.  Sit around and apply for jobs.  Wait for school to start.  I thought I could take it.  I can't.  I can't sit here and deal with this.

I got turned down at a temp agency today.  Twice.  The only jobs I get offered are organizing positions, and most of those are out of state.  Normally my state of holding wouldn't keep me so unhappy, but lately the jobs that I've applied for have almost been cosmically yanked from me.  It's like they take a look at my resume and decide that I'm going to either organize their staff (at a funeral home, of all places, I got the question ""So how does that organizing stuff work?  Do you guys just pick a place and ask people to sign up?  Can you do it without working there?""  <nervous shuffle of papers>)  I can't dip anymore into my savings because it took me so long to save it all in the first place.  Now the credit card companies are demanding more money and my loans are starting to pile up.  Before I know it my debt will eat me alive, and I'll never move out of this fucking house.  I don't want to be here two years from now.  I don't want to live in Gaithersburg when I'm 29.  I Love my friends, but I'd at least like to be away.  This just feels horrible.

I'm done."

"event","Here's the problem that I see with raiding.

I'm sitting in a bar with my girfriend. She buys me a drink, tells me to cheer up. I'm totally bummed out, moaning and complaining. She's trying her damndest now, really giving me a reason to believe that if I just snap out of it, we can turn things around. She's always been a giving, considerate, woman and she's proving it right there. But I just can't see it, for whatever reason, and I just don't pay attention to what she has to say. She starts to feel hurt now and tears up a little. Before she can full-on cry, I head for the bathroom shouting ""Now the waterworks start.""

Now you've been sitting at the bar too, drinking and watching this ordeal. I obviously appear ridiculous, but the girlfriend seems worth her salt and in need of some bolstering. You talk and after a few minutes, you begin to find yourself attracted to my girlfriend. You tell yourself that it's okay, too, because the attraction is mutual and I'm a big jerk who doesn't listen. You invite her to leave with you, and as you get up and pay for your drinks, I walk over. I point to your girlfriend, who's currently crying in the corner... 

Here's where paths diverge:

In the movement, we seem to think that we know best all the time. As a collective, we can agree on a course of action that can best help all of us, but we hate to even think that singularly we might just be stupid. The truth is, regardless of how awesome you think your organizing model is, or how sweet of a rap you think you've got, or how much money your organizing department has, Members Run Their Union and it is their job to make changes by being an informed body. 

Members are often kept out of the loop by an exaggerated process and convoluted rules and regs. If we wanted them to feel good about their participation and fight hard for their contracts, we'd involve them in a real way and sincerely support them when times got hard.

The sad truth is that none of that happens. Usually once they are members they are dutifully ignored until we need volunteer ridealong partners for housecalls or until contract time rolls around and we send out the fleet of reps. We don't talk to them unless we think we need them, and that's just foolish. I've seen it in the internationals I've worked for and it never makes for a good situation.

Getting back to the analogy, you're not paying attention to your own partner. It's fine to make friends, but you're obviously not doing that. What you are doing is looking for a way to increase your own happiness with the caveat that you're doing something good for something else so it must make it okay to cheat on your girlfriend. I might be a jerk sometimes, but I'm her jerk...sometimes. You weren't there when I was there for her birthdays and weddings and funerals. You haven't been on our dates or read our love letters. You haven't been there long at all, and really couldn't hear so good from your barstool anyway. So what makes you think you could even do better? You don't even know her yet. You don't know how demanding a relationship can be on both sides in our case. I work all the time away from home and she needs more support. But she also needs me to go out and get that money so we can both eat. While it's not romantic, it's the truth. And the truth builds relationships, not drinks at a bar with some guy with a good shirt on and some hair product. Because tomorrow, you'll look just as grimey as me, you'll just be a different dude. And you'll go to work too, because you can't eat off love, as hard as we try to."

so it's one of the only two afternoons i have off all week.  the only two days i don't work doubles (i haven't had an entire day off without work since i had to go home for a week to visit the family at xmas).  and i usually use the time off to catch up on sleep but i was going to clean the disaster pit that is my room.  and not really desiring to do this i decided to procrastinate by checking my email.  in my inbox was an email from a friend that i hung out with this summer before he moved away saying that he had just unfriended me because i don't ever really email with him anymore.  and i don't and that's fair.  it just made me stop and think.  i'm not very good at keeping in touch with anyone.  and it's not that i don't think about them or that i don't care.  and i know everyone's really busy and has life rough.  and my way of dealing with being super busy happens to be coming home at the end of the night and falling asleep.  chances are extremely high that along the way i've forgotten to email/call people.  (not that i have anything much to say other than work bitching) which makes me a bad friend.  not because i don't care but because i don't care enough to give up one of my few hours off for sleep.  and i'm searching my playlists for a happy song to play but they just don't sound right to me right now.  there isn't going to be one that does.  i'm at a place in my life where if i stay here i'm not going to go anywhere with it.  and i know it and it's depressing me and frustrating me and that's manifesting itself in being mean to my friends and the girl i'm involved with, customers, and coworkers.  i'm not in school right now, i'm working a ridiculous amount of hours at a couple different jobs for not very much money to pay the bills and virtually no time off, i'm short on sleep/temper/stability/energy.  it's time to move on.  this will be my last year in ithaca, ny and come august 2007 i will be gone.  i am glad i came here but i've started to wear on my welcome and i can feel it.  ithaca is shrinking around me in opportunity and it's making me claustrophobic.  i need to start taking steps to get out of here.  so that i can get a degree, so that i can get a better paying job, so that i can actually have the time and energy to give to my friends.  so that one day they won't have to unfriend me.  because i do still love them."

"event","this is NOT the way i recommend starting your week off:

open your eyes and see light.  (as an opener if i see light it means i've overslept.)  start to panic. shit shit shit. look at the clock...it's blinking 810. begin to really panic. check your cell phone. 811. holy fuck. start freaking out. you were supposed to be at work at 630. damnit damnit damnit. grab a sweatshirt and clutch it to your chest as you sprint downstairs in boy shorts to pound on your roommate's door. ask if there's any way you can have a ride? she can't get you there before 9. sprint back upstairs and check the time again. you have to leave right now and run to the bus stop to catch the bus but let's just say a shower is non-negotiable. keep panicking, realize you will most likely get fired. start to cry, call your co-worker half-way hysterical for advice, and jump in the shower. get out of the shower and reach for the black tie. if you're going to get axed you might as well look the part. have your co-worker call back and ask where you are because your boss just called him and asked him to come in. holy fuck. get to the cafe at 855 (almost 3 hours late!!) and rush through opening and making coffee while continuing to freak out and intermittantly tearing up. have an english breakfast tea and ponder whether you should call gimme today and see if they need another barista or wait until the axe falls.  happy fucking monday!"

"event","sick.  which automatically makes me whingy, bitchy, needy, and generally less than my better self.  frustrated with work right now too.  there was an incident at the pet store requiring a judgement call that i didn't actually make but supported the coworker who did.  it involved refusing to sell a bird to a group of people on the grounds that they wouldn't care for it correctly.  the group of people of course got extremely upset and made a scene and came back and eventually ended up purchasing the bird and the required supplies.  my boss at the pet store said he supported us at the time but was definately less than pleased with me over it.  i guess he felt i should know better how to handle things.  well, i guess i probably should i've been there long enough now.  but he said he was over it and not angry.  when a very similar situation arose this weekend involving an expensive animal and inappropriate conditions and i took a similar action, he was very quick to get sharp with me.  according to him we don't know that the conditions are actually unsuitable and we should give the people the benefit of the doubt.  even when in this situation (like the other one) the individuals involved clearly didn't give us any reason to give them any room for doubt.  at the cafe i feel like i have a basic working understanding of the how to make drinks part.  they're not the best drinks ever (one day...just give me time...) but for the most part i feel like maybe i can handle myself behind the bar.  after all i've been here almost 6 months.  and then the other day i spill my boss's latte foam, after having to pull an shot twice, and today i get a comment on how my co-workers have cool latte art.  granted, part of the problem is me, i have this whole ""i want to be the best employee i want to be perfect i want my boss to like me and am always halfway convinced that my boss hates me"" issue.  i know that.  but i also feel like i'm again too comfortable at work, too confident that i know what i'm doing/am doing enough.  and my response to that has always been to step it up and take on additional responsibilities or learn new things.  at the same time i feel like hey, give me a little credit for what i do do because i feel like i deserve it some credit for it.  although i suppose it's good for me to not be complacent...and i probably don't deserve anything i just think i do."

every year when it comes time for me to go home there's always a reason (named my brother) that prevents my parents from picking me up at the airport.  after we go back and forth fighting about my coming home.  as soon as they secure the ""yes i'll come"" from me they're done.  they conveniently forget that they have to pick me up at the airport.  and it always turns into well you know we love him more so you'll just have to sit at the airport and wait.  as if i have to give them a reason to choose him over me.  this year is to be no different.  says the message on my phone when i get off work tonight: ""well your brother has a final on monday night so we're going down to get him and bring him home...what time does your flight get in again?  we might not be able to get you right away...""

"event","11:11.  make a wish.  i wish that tonight a good friend didn't say that he didn't want to talk to me because all i am is depressing.  i wish that i could trust in people not to leave...that i wasn't afraid that they will.  that i know to everyone i meet there is an end.  that when i think of friends and friendships it would be with a sense of permanence.  that my belief in ""the people you love can always leave"" wasn't so strong.  and hadn't been so well reinforced.  (no, you weren't the first and you certainly won't be the last.)  so after he made the comment i resolved to not say anything depressing the rest of the night.  but how much does that leave me to talk about?  i am frustratedly amused by my bad luck and how it insists on persisting despite the ""rabbit rabbit"" on the first.  i'm just not superstitious, maybe that's why it didn't help.  i went through three groups of people before finding someone to feed me turkey on thanksgiving--i'm not feeling so popular.  my housemates hate me because i don't do my chores on time even though i'm never home to use anything in the house except the shower.  really i'm just their easy scapegoat.  i'm fighting with my parents about school/no school while struggling through double shifts.  12-15 hour work days and my life is just flying by.  that has always been my thing.  work enough and life narrows down to awakening to the alarm, getting to work on time, being as productive as possible to be a good employee, leaving before the sun rises and returning just hours before it will rise again, fall into bed for a few hours before repeating.  perhaps a dinner or a bar night mixed in.  it's autopilot.  healing.  survival.  a defense mechanism.  a no-thinking, no time for much of anything schedule.  no time for feeling anything except tired.  no inadequate feelings over school, no lack of direction, no loneliness/frustration/anger, no thoughts of the future (or thinking about life in general) beyond next week's schedule.  where do i have to be and when tomorrow morning?"

it's a month later...a month since i have mocked customers and recorded the little events that make my life mine.  i had seven stitches put in my finger courtesy of subway.  i have a new conch piercing courtesy of a goal i achieved.

school starts tomorrow.  it's been over a year since i have been at the institution for which i moved to ny.  i am nervous that i don't have what i need to finish my degree.  i am afraid that i do and don't believe it enough.  i am scared that i will be too ""experienced"" (and i use that term loosely) for my classmates and i am clearly not ""experienced"" enough for the real world.

i have an interview for another job tomorrow that i don't have time for but need the money from.

though a few of its members have moved further away, i have a group of people whom i love and gladly call my friends and an environment in which i feel comfortable.  but it's an environment that i can't stay in indefinitely...i can't continue to be a mall employee in dear ithaca all my life.

just the thoughts that are in my head."

my friends are all either a couple years older or a couple years younger.

monday night after grocery shopping i had one of my favorite meals planned out.  spinach pasta with butter and parmesan cheese and chicken.  ever so tasty.  my housemate moved out for good on saturday after living here for 3 years so the majority of the supplies and things in the house were hers.  not until that night did i realize just how many basics i lacked.  i went to cook the chicken...but lacked utensils to do so.  so i was like ok i'll just have pasta...except again no utensils, no colander, no [insert kitchen utensil here].  add no dishes or silverware to eat said dinner off of in the event that i had managed to cook it.  but i don't know how to cook.  so off to target for me to stock up on the basics.  it makes me feel very grown up to be picking out kitchen stuff and also very nervous.  i mean what do i want or need for kitchen stuff?  all the apartment essentials that i have had to deal with acquiring lately have made me aware of just how young i am and an inkling of how much growing up i still have to do.

"event","one fun thing about working so much is the ample opportunities provided for things to go wrong and people to amuse me.

thing that went wrong:  so today at the subshop our hotbay that keeps all our hot food up to temperature decided to make electricity noises and stop working.  annoying.  so we call the repair man in the morning and he comes in to fix it.  he rigs up some wires since evidently we need new parts and all these sparks fly.  and he goes, well it's fixed for now but if sparks fly or it makes that noise again turn it off and don't use it.  fabulous.  so if i get electrocuted tomorrow we all know why.

amusing customer:  this woman came through the sub line and ordered a sub.  she said she was allergic to seafood and ordered a meatball sub.  but see above thing that went wrong of the day, our hotbay wasn't working.  so when my coworker went to put her meatballs in the microwave, so she wouldn't get sick from undercooked meat, she freaked out because she was terribly, horribly allergic to seafood and seafood might have touched the microwave!  we explained to her that seafood was never put in the microwave.  and she argued that someone might have touched seafood and then touched the microwave.  at which point i am thinking woman if you are so damn allergic don't eat at a fast food restaurant.  but we calm her down and she pays and leaves.  and returns not 5 minutes later with her sub inexplicably wrapped in napkins and wants a new sandwich because the meatballs taste ""burnt"" and the sub is too messy.  gee a sub dripping with marinara is messy?  so the manager appeases her by making her a new one and sending her on her grumpy way.

the oddity of the day...a massive group of people sporting bright blue southern baptist t-shirts and jesus loves you stickers descended on subway for lunch.  they were on a mission trip from the middle of nowhere, missouri.  and they stopped at the pyramid mall in ny for lunch.  random.  i got the impression they would rather i had not been part of their lunching experience."

"event","i was making my way home from a bbq late last night on foot, after, as i often do when i feel i need to assert myself as an independent woman (read be stubborn), insisting that i am a big girl and can walk home alone.  the walk from the bbq to my place is about thirty minutes, it was around 3am and so i was walking fairly briskly, my backpack over my shoulders, my boys' sandals slaps on the pavement echoing.  ahead of me there were two girls walking home from collegetown, talking loudly, and weaving slightly.  suddenly they heard me behind them, turned around and stared, became silent, walked a little faster, turned around and stared again, and then crossed the street to continue their walk home on the other side.  i couldn't believe it!  they were afraid of me?  these girls had several inches and several pounds on my 5'1"" 110lb frame and there were two of them to the one of me.  earlier in the night a friend of mine had told me he thought for a long time that i was still in high school (hopefully because of my stature and not my maturity level...) but nonetheless perhaps the only thing intimidating about me is the sharpness of the spikes in my hair.  so why did they feel the need to cross the street?

in pet store news, a man came into the store yesterday and asked to see the rabbits.  i hand him one of our rabbits, a fuzzy ball with floppy ears and big feet.  he hefts the rabbit in his hands a little and says to the rabbit, ""yeah, you're about the perfect size for eating.""  and here my jaw drops as he proceeds to tell me that he is from missouri where they have a farm of approx 600 rabbits that they raise and sell for meat.  granted i am a carnivore and i sell animals to be fed to other animals on a daily basis but i couldn't help breathing a sigh of relief when the man returned the rabbit and made his way down the mall to continue his shopping."

in other news the drama in my life is pretty much resolved and life is back to normal.  which is nice.  the gorge that i usually go swimming in is closed for the summer which does not amuse me because it is ridiculously hot and humid.  right now it is starting to storm.  lightning and cool breezes.  i love storms."

"event","i killed a fish tonight.  or will have killed a fish tomorrow as it was still alive, floating upside down, and fluttering its gills at 90mph when i left work tonight.  the fish's imminent death was preceded by a man, a nice early 50-something guy with a massive tank, coming into the store near close to pick up the red-bellied pacu he has had on hold for the past week or so.  the fish is about 8 inches long and 5 inches wide and jess guesses around 8 pounds.  not a tiny fish.  it is being held in a 20 gallon high in which it can barely turn around and the largest net available to me is about 6 inches long and 4 inches wide.  the net will barley fit into the largest bag to transport the fish.  clearly not a good situation.  so i net the fish and as i am lifting him out of the water he launches himself out of the net...and drops about 6.5 feet to smack on the tile floor.  where he proceeds to wiggle and flop around for about two minutes while i am freaking out and trying to get him into the bag.  with my hands.  after what seems like forever, the fish is back into the bag and the bag is floating in the tank.  the gentleman who wanted the fish was quite amused and thankfully very low-key about everything.  he left with the plan to call in the morning and inquire as to the pacu's condition, saying that he was not looking for the fish specifically and if it died, it was not a big deal.  thank god.  when the fish dies it will be the first creature that i have accidentally done in at the pet store in the almost 9 months that i have worked there.  granted it was probably coming to me eventually but traumatic nonetheless.

in other news, having broken my ""no drinking until finals are over"" rule, put in place partly to keep me out of trouble (i tend to be make-out friendly when drunk) and partly to teach myself some discipline and responsibility, i got quite drunk with my coworkers saturday night.  i had a blast dancing and remembered all the events of the night.  but now i am faced with the dilemma...having broken the rule, do i throw it out the window or attempt to salvage it for the next two weeks?"

"event","so it's such a noteable event for me NOT to be passing out facedown in a textbook in full makeup and contacts still dressed from the day that i'm devoting space to it.  remember the whole i don't feel like i am close to anyone rant?  oh yeah that's because i'm so busy i don't have time to be close to anyone.  between full-time classes, marathon training, almost full-time work, and the queer club i leave my house at 7 or 8 in the morning and don't get home until 930 or 10 at night.  i have no idea what's going on in the lives of the people i would call my friends if i had time to talk to them and spend so much time commuting on the bus i might as well be dating my cd player since i listen to that more than anything else.  while i am very fond of my barristas, i think i see them as least as much as my roommate if not more.  speaking of roommate we've been getting along because we never see each other to get on each other's nerves.  i don't have time to get my hair cut, do my laundry, buy food, or even go to the bank to cash the checks that i am earning.  and i don't feel like i can tell my boss to lighten up on the hours because not only do i need the money badly, i know my co-workers have no more time than i do to pick up the slack.  so what do i do?  i spend my days moving from one thing to another and feeling incredibly busy and strangely alone all at the same time.

oh, and scratch that betta living thing as well...though i did take the time to feed him."

"event","disclaimer:  no expectations of literary greatness please, i'm an engineering major and a pet store employee not an english major.

despite having an excellent semester academically, a successful start to training for the adirondack marathon, plenty of hours at the pet store, and a betta that has managed to outlive his four day guarantee, i can't help but feel like something is missing in my life.  despite being surrounded by a diverse group of people that i care about and that i would call ""friends,"" i don't feel like i have a single ""close"" friend.  and thus at 2 in the morning instead of finishing my stats hw i'm pondering coming up on the ""it's been a year since"" mark for a series of difficult events in my life and finding myself as expected a year stronger but a year more distant from my companions."

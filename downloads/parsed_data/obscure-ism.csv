I would say I&nbsp;don't have time, but it's really because I'm so goddamn lazy.&nbsp; Anyway, I wish I&nbsp;had something interesting to say. I've had a lot going on in my head lately. I'm so happy one minute, then the next I&nbsp;just wanna..I dunno. Well, I do know. I&nbsp;just..wish I didn't feel this way anymore. It follows me everywhere. The other day at the gym, I thought of something, and it really hit me hard. i thought:<br />&quot;<span style=""font-size: medium;"">I wish I started smoking or drinking. At least that's acceptable. I&nbsp;have to hide what I do. I&nbsp;can't do it with friends, or a group of people, or at a party. When someone finds out what I do, they look at me like a freak.&quot;<br /><span style=""font-size: smaller;"">I don't understand why it has to be that way to me, but it is. I just want this feeling to stop following me. I want to stop listening to songs about death and cutting. I want to stop looking for reasons to be sad. I have to much to be grateful for, and I need to appreciate it all more than I do. I just want someone to drill that into my mind so I can learn it.<br />Honestly, it's been over a year, and I&nbsp;still get these feelings and urges. Still. I have yet to give in. I am strong. I hope. I think<br /><br />Anyway, I'm seeing Tim and Eric tomorrow. Baller? I think so.</span><br /></span>"

"event","I haven't updated since before I left for college! Holy crapp. Anyway, I've been here for three weeks, and I love it. 
I've made so many new friends! i'm so glad i kept in touch with Tara and Sam because they're my bestest friends here. I&nbsp;love them to death. And there's so many other people i&nbsp;love. Andd of course there's my new boyfriend Johnny :) This one's special, I'm telling you. Everything just feels right, more right than anyone else ever has.
A lot has changed since I&nbsp;last updated. A lot. Pretty much every entry I made from the end of the summer should be erased. Part of me wants to erase anything involving Justin, Kyle, and Sunny. I'm a huge bitch, I know what I did was horrible, but I&nbsp;did what I&nbsp;had to do to be happy, and now i'm paying the price. But anyway, I miss my friends. So much.&nbsp; I feel so bad about leaving my Shelby behind. It's not fair. I hope she's doing alright, I&nbsp;can't wait to go back and see her. And Amy, god I&nbsp;miss her. We skyped a few times, and it just wasn't the same. I&nbsp;hope her senior year goes well. she's going to do great. It's weird, I&nbsp;met her when she was about 14, and she's turning 18 really soon. I watched her grow up, kinda. I feel like her older sister and like I&nbsp;need to look out for her, but i&nbsp;know she's doing fine on her own.
I have a ton of Sociology reading to do, so I should probably go do that. blahh."

"event","Wow, my summer is pretty much over. I always write a journal entry about how epic my summer was, and this is no exception. Well, it started out great, then became really awful, then became absolutely amazing. I have so many good memories from it. As usual, I'll list them all. And I&nbsp;don't care. If it made me smile, it made the list(in no order):
-Being done with school in may
-The epic tent in my backyard after prom
-The fire department being called on me, Shelby, Marisa, Ryan, Tim, and Matt because we made s'mores in my backyard.
-Making it to the Western Mass Finals in tennis, but losing because Matt and I were up until 4 am the night before.
- Driving around Dalton, blasting music, singing at the top of my lungs
-Shelby and Ashley coming over to help me feel better post- breakup
-Ryan and I going to the mall, trolling IRL, then going back to my house and playing RE5 and Dead Space.
-I had the best Connecticon ever this year. I got to meet Justin, Kyle and Sonny. And I&nbsp;got to go to the rave!
-The fact that Justin and Kyle are some of my best friends from this summer is amazing, considering that I actually met them on chatroulette.
-Sonny driving Justin and Kyle all the way down here to visit me and Amy and go out to dinner, then they let me show them around Springfield. We went to Nathan Bill, and played on the playground, and looked at stars.
-&nbsp;Going to Six Flags with Justin, Kyle, Sonny, and Luis. They got me to open up so much that day. I went on so many rides I never thought I'd go on.&nbsp;And in the water park, being obnoxious, haha. Justin was always carrying me around and pretending to throw me into the water. and Kyle was always splashing me and making me feel scared. Sonny was to busy getting killed by girls XD
-All of my trips to Gamestop and iParty with Amy
-Going to Katie's and making Dannyopoly. We remembered that Cumby's gives away free food at closing, so we ran to get here. Leaving her house, I&nbsp;misstepped on his stairs and fell, respraining my ankle. 
-Conrad making Gianna and Herschel a &quot;couple&quot; at camp
-Justin's basement and being on the &quot;other side&quot;
-My cruise! SO&nbsp;AMAZING &lt;3
- Mayhem Fest? I was pumped as balls the night before, and it lived up to every expectation I had.
The beach with Amy and Lessa. As a joke, we talked in Russian accents all day. People actually asked us where we were from and stuff. It was hilarious.
-Going into Gamestop dressed at Resident evil characters. Chase flipped out and wanted a picture with us. And I'm texting Chase as we speak.
-when Lessa stole Mike's Snicker's Almond bar
-When Shelby and I saw the Prince of Persia just to see Jake Gyllenhaal not wearing a shirt for 2 hours
- Seeing Despicable Me with my parents :)
-Then Justin and Kyle and laughing because there was characters in the movie named both &quot;Justin&quot; and Kyle&quot; Justin was a fat kid who tried to fly. Kyle was a dog flea thing. XD
-My graduation party and running for the ice cream truck.
- Taco Tuesdays with Dan and Jimmy
-Throwing an iced coffee at a van ,and driving past it everyday with Amy&nbsp; to see if they cleaned it off.
&nbsp;They never did.
-The Van that runs on fun..is apparently always running in the East Longmeadow plaza parking lot
-BOW ASS
-Watching the awful horror movies at Nicole's house and laughing at Twizzzler's being the key object in the movie.
-Getting my belly button pierced in Noho !
-Sitting in Forest Park with Marisa, and enjoying slurpies and candy bars
- &quot;BIIIIKEEERRRRRRR&quot;
-When Matt Valentine brought me an iced coffee one day when I was at work. 
-Going to Six Flags with Ryan and posing on rides that take your picture XD
-Singing by the camp fire at Becca's 365 party
-Meeting awesome friends at orientation.
- Graduating from high school
-Winning Western Mass. Again.


I think I covered everything. I'll keep adding because I know I'll remember more. Each memory will have a special place in my heart, as always. But these memories seem to stick out more. I made a lot of new friends, who really helped improve my summer experience. My best friends ever stayed loyal and always remained there for me. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
I leave for Hampton Beach in the morning with Shelby. I haven't seen her since Connecticon really, which bums me out, but we've both been busy. I had work. she's been with Ryan, family, getting ready for school. It's just sucked. We need this time together :)
I'm dead though and I'm about to go Skype, so I'll try to think of more along the way."

"event","WELL, today was definitely awesome. The other night I&nbsp;hung out with Justin, Kyle, and Sunny, and they invited me and Amy to go to Six Flags with them today. I'd never really been, and Amy hadn't gone in years, so we were like, &quot;OH&nbsp;WHAT&nbsp;THE&nbsp;HELL. I&nbsp;GUESS&nbsp;SO.&quot; SO, we went. Annnnd, it was pretty awesome. I mean, there was a little drama, but we all managed to fix it pretty quickly. It's weird, considering how we all met, we probably shouldn't be hanging out, but you know, now that I've hung out with them, I love it. They're so awesome! I love hanging out with them, they're really funny and they make fun of each other. it's great. XD ANYWAY, today:
At first they were like &quot;BIZARRO, MIND ERASER, BUTTFUCK&quot; and I was like &quot;NOOOOO.&quot; So they went on Flahsback, while Amy and i hit up the Scrambler. I had wicked bad cramps, but they wanted to go on other stuff, and I wanted to find Advil. That kinda started some shit, but whatever. Then I felt better, so we went on the Cyclone, which as the shittiest roller coaster ever. XD It was so funny, it was me and Justin in one row, then Sunny and Kyle ahead of us. Then Luis and some random guy with long hair. I only saw the guy from behind, so I jokingly said &quot;LUIS, YOU GONNA PUT THE MOVES ON THAT STRANGER?!&quot; and the guy turned around and gave me a dirty look. They pretended not to know me for the entire ride. We went on Blizzard River after that, but while we were waiting in line, Justin got a call that some friends arrived, so he, kyle, and Luis(Their other awesome friend) went and met them. Sunny stayed with us and we went on. Then we met up and their friends turned out to be three tall, pretty Brazilian girls. Amy and i were like &quot;WTF&quot; and ditched them, We went to Hurricane Harbour and ate nachos, and we kept getting calls from them like &quot;Come on. come back. Please&quot; Amy and i were like, &quot;No, Don't invite us then invite a ton of other girls. That's dumb.&quot; which caused more drama, but nothing we couldn't fix, because they turned out to be awesome. And I guess they've all been friends since fetus days. So, they went to the water park with us and we all went swimming. Well, kinda. It was mostly Justin and Kyle splashing me and making fun of me for not being able to swim, and two of the Brazilian girls trying to drown Sunny and picking him up and throwing him XD Then we got hungry, so we went to eat, and go on more rides. We decided to go on the Tomahawk, which was fun. The one at the Big E is better, though. Then they demanded the Mind Eraser, but I was too scared, so Amy and i went on the swings and teacups while they did that. They got me to go on Batman with them, which I never would have done before. But Justin made me feel really comfortable and held my hand and made sure I didn't cry. And they kept me laughing the entire time, so I wasn't even scared. When it was over I wanted to ride it again, but the park was closing. So, all in all, it was an awesome day. I want more like it.&nbsp; 
I don't wanna go back to work tomorrow. GAHHH, I&nbsp;love weekends &lt;3
Hopefully something update worthy will happen this week. We'll find out!"

ANYWAy, It's the day after Connecticon and I'm suffering from a little post-con depression, but I had an AMAZING time. I met awesome people, and made some new friends :) I got to meet Justin, and I met an awesome Kakashi. We talk a lot and stuff. I'm enjoying it! ANAL&nbsp;SANCTUARY. haa, but yeah. Hiller got me in for free on Sunday, which was totally awesome of him. last night he and I&nbsp;had a talk about our year. We both had people die in our family in horrible ways on the same day. Exactly a week after Conor died. Daw, tomorrow is four months. conorrr &lt;3
So, I went to Katie's last weekend. tha twas awesome, until I resprained my ankle there ): Right after we spent like 3 hours making Dannyopoly, we decided to walk to cumby's to steal their food when they close. As we were leaving her house, I was going down the stairs, and yeah, not good. ANYWAY, haha. I'm back in my brace, and I can't play tennis for a bit. DIIICKKK. That pisses me off. I hope i can heal by the tournament. Conrad says we're going back to Nationals. i'd love it. And it's in Arizona, not alabama. NO&nbsp; SHITTY&nbsp;MeMORIES.
I went to Becca's 365 Party on Thursday. that was a lot of fun. I pretty much love everyone there, and of course, we told our trademark &quot;ghost stories&quot; BAHAH. 
My brother is home, I miss that boy. Sometimes I wish he didn't attend a military academy so he could be home more, but I'm so glad he's happy where he is and he loves it there. We're going to Mayhem Fest after our cruise next week. I'm mad excited.&nbsp; And i leave for&nbsp; college on August 23.&nbsp; UMD here i come!"

"event","Conrad camp started today. Mmmm, fun. I always find myself writing an entry about camp and team tennis at the end of the summer, but never right when it starts. But, today was weird. When I got there, I felt weird. I don't know what brought it on, but something happened. I just got bombarded with memories from my first summer working at camp. I remember, I&nbsp;was 16, newly single, had one guy on my mind, and I was determined to make things work. Not much was in the way, he was only 21, going off to college, and wanted nothing to do with me. I did spend every morning woth him at camp, though. Best 3 hours of my life.&nbsp; I remember the day I told him I liked him. I was with Shelby, and I had just come back from the Cape with Ashley. Ashley, Tammy, and Geena knew how I felt, they often teased me about it.&nbsp; Anyway, long story short, I haven't talked to him since then, since he told me he never wanted to talk to me again.  But, I'm okay with it. I'm totally fine with it. i just, don't like it when stuff like that comes back to haunt me.
Anyway, last summer wasn't all bad. Just like 75% It was bad until August, then it looked up for a bit, then it got awful. Then in September, things started to look up again. And they've just gone up from there. I can honestly say I have the best friends in the world. A family that would do anything for me, and has already proven to me that they would. A boyfriend who has shown me that we can be apart for months, then reunite like nothing ever happened. A boyfriend who will tell me he loves me, and do anything to bring a smile to my face, tell me I'm beautiful as often as he can, and shows me he loves me like no one else ever has. I have a tennis coach that never gives up on me, puts all the trust he can in me, and is not looking forward to letting me go to college. What's there to not love? I love it all.
I went to college orientation a few weeks ago. It was okay. I made a few good friends. I'm excited for the fall, but I don't want to go. Not just yet. I just want to chill and whatnot before I go. And uhh, Connecticon is in like...2 weeks! HOLY&nbsp;BALLS. Right? I'm so excited. Whatever. I'm rambling right now. That's all I have to say for now.&nbsp;I'll update again eventually, you know how it goes."

Wow, I never update this anymore. It's kinda sad, but I think it's about time I&nbsp;did. So anyway, how's life? Let me just say that I have 12 days left of school. I&nbsp;love thissss.&nbsp; AND&nbsp;TENNIS. haha, it's so shitty. I was 0-5, and i was finally winning, and I&nbsp;sprained my ankle. SO&nbsp;AWESOME. I've been out for a week, and I really hate it.

This long distance thing is tough, but it's so worth it.&nbsp;I just want this next week to go by fast. I know he has other peopel to see and other stuff to do, but that's perfectly fine with me. I'm well aware of the fact that he has a life otuside of me. Even when he is in this state, he's still an hour and a half away from me, so it's everyday stuff for me. I'm just glad we're doing as well as we are! :D 
AND&nbsp;friends, haaa. I'll leave it at that. just...friends. I don't even know anymore. I&nbsp;give up, I&nbsp;really do. 
OH! I&nbsp;got my monroe piercing&nbsp; finally! I&nbsp;got accepted to every college I applied to, so my parents okay-d it.&nbsp;I don't think I ever wrote that I worked at Grande Meadows for like 3 months. I&nbsp;did. I&nbsp;hated it. Thank God I'm out of there.

"event","Amidst all my unhappiness, I managed to smile today.<br />I&nbsp;got a card in the mail from my Aunt Kathy and Uncle Ronnie wishing me luck at Nationals. You know, I&nbsp;completely forgot about Nationals.LIke, I'd mentioned it, but this card just made me realize it's happening. And I&nbsp;can't wait.<br /><br />If you're all curious, I'm 50/50 right now.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I'm doing any better, but I'm not doing any worse. I&nbsp;hate to say it, but when people ask me if I'm alright, me saying &quot;Yeah, fine!&quot; is an absolutely lie. I&nbsp;just don't want to talk about it anymore. Because the more I&nbsp;talk about the, the more I want to cry. And i&nbsp;have a reason for all this. He was the one who saved me. From myself. After all that crap happened around Christmas with Ashley and Joe, he was there. When all my friends were telling me to &quot;get over it&quot; we were texting until 1 am, and he was giving it everything he had to make me smile or laugh. Now that's gone. And I&nbsp;feel lost.<br /><br />My song right now is &quot;A Time for Yohe&quot; by Between the Trees. I&nbsp;had it on my ipod, but I&nbsp;didn't listen to it until Saturday night. Because it came on the shuffle and it sounded sad. But, I&nbsp;listened to the song, looked up the lyrics, and i broke down. It was exactly how I&nbsp;felt. I've been listening to that song so much lately. And I'm still crying to it. Not right now, though. Because I'm listening to Hollywood Undead. Random tangent: I&nbsp;hears &quot;Everywhere I&nbsp;go&quot; on the radio yesterday and they butchered it so bad xD Every other word is taken out.&nbsp; Okay, the lyrics just...I&nbsp;can relate so much, and it scares me.<br /><br />I&nbsp;went to Shelby's last night. We watched Bee Movie for like 45 minutes and laughed at all the fails in it. Then we had dinner and had this angel hair stuff. And we laughed about the time we made that, and I&nbsp;made her laugh while she was eating it.And she threw it up on the floor from laughing so hard. But, no one needs to know that :P Then we watched all of our favorite internet videos. Tourettes Guy, Is It a Good Idea to Microwave This?, Keyboard Kid, The Zombie Turtle Kid,&nbsp; SUper Mario Frustration, My Hands are Bananas. And we just laughed. And laughed.<br /><br />Then I&nbsp;went home and played Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2 or something. And texted some friends. Finished my Snapple. And I&nbsp;didn't cry. That felt liberating. I really felt like I&nbsp;was getting better. But, if that's the case, then why do I&nbsp;want to cry so bad right now? No one cares. <strong>Maybe I&nbsp;should just &quot;Get over it&quot;</strong><br /><br />"

The fact that she's Ashley's cousin does not change how I feel about her. But, I think the fact that Ashley and I are no longer friends changes how she feels about me.

Right now, I'm in one of my moods. That mood where I&nbsp;jut want to disappear. I&nbsp;don't even want to hurt myself. I just want to go away.
I'm supposed to hang out with Keith tonight. But it's 5 and I&nbsp;haven't heard from him. If I&nbsp;don't hear from him in an hour, I'm going out to dinner with Tiffany.

Anyway, I'm done with work. Thank GAWD. I hated it.
I gotta go to some Boy Scout picnic thingy tomorrow. I'm not really sure what I'm going for. I'll probably be ignored, none of Keith's friends like me. Whatever, as long as I&nbsp;drive there, I&nbsp;can leave when I&nbsp;please."

WAY&nbsp;TOO&nbsp;LONG.
So much has changed. SO many good things. As of 1.28.09 I am officially taken by Keith Giovaninni. 
Um, I&nbsp;haven't updated since all that crap. And Ashley and I&nbsp;are still not friends. So, cool. I&nbsp;don't want ot be friends with a liar. And if her self esteem is that low, get hurrr away from me.
BUT&nbsp;ANYWAY. Keith and Liz! We're so good. Like...it's just GOOD. I really like him. My parents love him. And I'm pretty sure Matthew likes him.
I&nbsp;dunno if his parents like me though. I think they can sense my democratic liberalness. 
Anyway, tennis is finally over. Finally. We made it to the finals in Western Mass. Which I&nbsp;cannot complain about. And school is almost over. But, that's about all that's good.
I've been lonely lately. My brother is home, but not home. I&nbsp;have friends that don't want to hang out with me. A boyfriend that I&nbsp;love with all my heart, but cannot please to save my life. A family that doesn't trust me. And a soon to be job that makes me cry. But, I have no reason to cry this year.And, Connecticon is in July. I still cannot find a safe haven for myself. Lately, I just don't feel like myself. I haven't seen any of my friends in weeks. Yes, I&nbsp;see Shelby and Amanda in school, but that's for 20 minutes a day, before school. Amy is always with Chris or at work. Katie doesn't live here. I just need to chill out.

But you know what. I'm over it. Ashley is being no better than a dirty whore, and i don't talk to her anymore. This whole thing has made me realize who my real friends are, and how many people actually care about me. I've actually made a lot of new friends and I'm feeling a lot better. I&nbsp;even think I have a new boy already :3
I'm going to Colorado in like a week. I'm wicked excited, i have no idea why we're even going, but i'm gonna miss school, so i'm not gonna complain.

I didn't rly get a whole lot of candy, but that's alright. We were a THREESOME alllll night baby. I'm glad my best friend and my boyfriend could chill. And MATTHEW'S&nbsp;HERE. He met Joe, after weeks of me freaking out about it. And Joe humped a tree stump. And we thought a guy was gonna give us condoms, because when he opened the door we were kissing. And Ashley found part of a rake. And I almost stole a puppy.&nbsp; Mmmmmm, I&nbsp;want chocolate. &nbsp;
Then tonight i&nbsp;went to Rachel's. And we had tacos. Then we hard core raved. YAY. Then we walked to a grave yard and played hide and seek. It wasn't really that scary, but it wasn't fun when Rachel and Nicole come bolting towards you, while&nbsp; you're sitting behind a grave alone in a cemetery, telling you that the police are walking around wit h flash lights trying to find people hiding and screaming XD So, we literally BOLTED out of there. And Ashley hit her leg on the gate as we were running and she has a nice random scab on it now. Then we went back to Rachel's, but on the way there, we picked up souvenirs. Drawers, life jackets, random pieces of wood. Then we went into her house and ate an entire&nbsp; fruit platter. Then we had to leave. SO, this weekend has been a ton of fun.

I can't wait until next weekend. Because I'll get to hang out with everyones again. Hopefully I&nbsp;can do something with Joe, he lives far away D:&nbsp; Actually, I went over Ashley's for the first time in forever. Everyone missed me so much. I love that family. i really do.

&nbsp;She's the best girlfriend he's ever had, but i have a feeling the minute he lends here, he's gonna go straight to her house and ignore his family :/

You know....FIYAH&nbsp;DICK. OH&nbsp;MY&nbsp;GOD. I love that. Last year &quot;OH&nbsp;SHIT&quot; This year, &quot;FIYAH&nbsp;DICK&quot; I can only imagine next year. Ahaha I lovelovelove Shelby and Ashley.

WELL, JIZ&nbsp;UPDATE!
Jiz if our Hollywood name i&nbsp;gave us. Bext name ever, riiiight?
Anyway, we're so good! he's wicked busy with Eagle Scout stuff, but I I'm trying to help. I think it's cute that he's an Eagle Scout. he actually follows the rules and stuff. I think it's the cutest thing in the world. I really do. he's a cute boy. We're gonna be around for a long, long time I think :]

SO, I kinda chilled with Tiffany today. We were both just waiting to be picked up and we talked. Which we never do anymore. Just..talk. I know things haven't been great for her lately, and I try to help. I&nbsp;don't even think I'm doing anything. But, I can relate. When you have friends who are taking completely different paths than you want then to. Then everyone is being judged. And everyone is really just wrong, but no one wants to give up being right And a friendship is falling apart, I&nbsp;can relate, more than you ever know.

Anime Conventions are the only place I feel I can go after a terrible week, just let go completely, and have an illegal amount of fun. And I have a job, so I don't have to worry about money this year. By the way, I'm going as Kotoko from Chobits. I'm not really don't with it yet, but I should be by Friday.
And I'm wicked excited because I am FINALLY going to meet Katie. It's wicked hard having a best friend that you've never met. I've known her since I was in 7th grade and what, I'm a junior now. And I still haven't met her. It's amazing how you can meet someone online and honestly within like a month they become one of your best friends. That's literally what happened to us, and seriously, we met on Neopets XD
So, I'm going to be in a good mood all week. That's always how i am the week before a con. I usually watch a ton of anime and read a lot of manga. And I've been listening to Jrock and Jpop all day and looking at cosplay pictures. I'm not excited XD I'm a loooser. D:

Anyway, I know for a fact work is going to suck this week. Why? Because it always sucks. And it's sucked ever since...forever. Well, not really. Just since like...last week. Well no, it's always sucked. Just a lot more since last week. I'm just tired of going there, losing brain cells, and well, just...bad things. I'm tired of going and just hearing stuff like, ""Shut the fuck up Liz"" Yeah sometimes I bring it on, but you know whhhha, fuck you. 

And I can now say I'm an independent, single, strong, and mostly useless chick. I'm only saying this because I'm listening to ""Game"" by Ayumi Hamasaki. And it's making me feel all...bad ass. But now I'm listening to ""Machiavellism"" by Dir en grey and I just feel like a crazy murderer.

The next food network star in ending tonight and my mommy and I are gonna watch it. Me and her have like a bajillion reality shows we watch together. TNFNS, Project Runway, Hell's Kitchen. We just like sit there and be all ""OH NO SHE DIN'T""

I was playing Guitar Hero yesterday and i can finally play on Expert. I'm proud of myself. I remember when I struggled with Medium. I'm going to apply for a job at Game Stop. I'm a chick, aaannnd I'm attractive(or I like to think so) It'd be a step up from who works there now. I'll get them business. I'm checking out the application now.

Wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be. I felt like I accomplished something because he's all quiet and socially awkward and I got him to open up to me and stuff. I like it when people do that. Then he told me Conrad has condoms in his dresser, which would be fine for anyone BUT Conrad. <br />And maybe I'm taking this too seriously, but I've been noticing things.

There, I said it.
I don't even know anymore. Just like...anything.
I went to the tennis camp training thing yesterday. It was basically the equivalence of taking a knitting needle and sticking it under your finger nails. But whatever, man. I'm gonna be getting paid to do this, so I shouldn't complain.
It was wicked stupid though! Like, I got made fun of a lot, but it was just Chris Allen. He really doesn't matter to me. Nor do his opinions. YAY FUCK YOU :] And John made fun of me, too. But whatevaaa. I wasn't there to impress him. I'm just annoying to him.&nbsp; Only good thing was he gave me a ride to Grande Meadows and I got to write ""HAPPY"" on my hand with a random Sharpie :] He's cute. I get nervous. What do you want me to say? rofl. SPEAKING OF CUTE. Whatever happened to Panera, Phuc? We were supposed to go, asshole D:&lt; Whatever. I'll get it out of him.

"event","Ok, for some reason. I feel that everyone should read this.
It's basically...well a story.
I've been getting a lot of crap from people lately. And even Paul. 
Let me just say. The day he broke up with me, he ignored me and completely denied my existence. I have a right to be a little pissed at that. I don't think anyone wants that, especially if it's from a person that, just the day before, told you they loved you so much and were never going to let go. That hurts, ok.
Mow, let me put this out there, on a relationship level, I'm over him. I don't want to get back together. I don't want to do anything romantically.
On a personal level, I'll never get over him. He was a great person and it sucks to lose someone likes him.

But, ever since we broke up, I've been getting a lot of crap from people who are his ""friends"" I use quotes because these people never seem to give a flying shit about him before he broke up with me. 

like the whole immature staring thing yesterday. That pissed me off. then today, Stefano had the nerve to just be nice to me? Ok yeah, great.

Then last night, I get a message from justin, The king of all Grammar:
Hey liz? Nobody. cares about you anymore. Fuck. You. You can take your cool ass little microwave and shove it up your ass. How dare you have the audacity to blame paul for everything thats going on. He has done nothing but talk nice about you and try to defend you around every corner and you find it necesary to yell t him about it. Fuck you you immature piece of shit because nobody honestly gives a fuck about you. How about you seriousy grow the fuck up and stop shitting on the one person that ever gave flying fuck about you. Can you be anymore of a bitch, i mean really??? Nobody treats you like shit because paul dumped you, they do it because your a cold heartless bitch to him for no reason at all. How. Fucking. Dare. You. And better not fucking dare yelling at paul about this shit, you can take this shit right to my doorstep. Becuase he has NOTHING to do with this. Grow fucking up. Lets quit pretending to cut ourselves for attention and have a little reality check, kthx.


WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING? Justin never cared about Paul until he broke up with me and he started treating me like shit. He knows all this about us, yet, Paul claims he didn't tell Justin anything. Ok.

Then like, none of my friends even care. Tiffany, honestly doesn't give a flying fuck about me anymore. And I will say that proudly. She can try and defend herself, but it's been drilled into my mind that I am no longer a part of her life, and she's made it rather clear to me. She can try to fix this, but I'll see what I can do. It's hard to be pushed away, then want to go back, ya know?

The only people that seem to care are like...Katie and Zorro. AND I NEVER SEE EITHER OF THEM. I'm seeing both of them this summer. Zor and I are gonna chill everyday and I'm gonna meet Katie at connecticon. FINALLY. I just hope this all cools off by then and we can just all be mature. And by that, I mean my self. My self, Paul, Tiffany, Justin, Nora, Dylan, Stefano, Dina, and whoever else has been involved with this.

So, don't attack me for this. Just, be mature. Like none of us have been. And let's just get over this."

I had such a good weekend. 
Friday, I slept over Shelby's. We did some interesting things. Like going through Billy's room in hope of finding a bong. Instead we found a traffic light, a ton of weed, and vaginal irritation cream. LOL OK.
I went home on Saturday and I was like...rly bored. SO ASHLEY SLEPT OVER We had a gewd time.
Then we went to her grandma's house and did yard work.&nbsp; Then we went back to my house for dinner. Then her mom picked us up and we went to Ashley's house. We annoyed Bob and ran around outside. Then we went bigfoot hunting. We got scared SHITLESS when we honestly thought we saw glowing eyes. Holy shit. Then we made bob go out with us and we made him carry a hockey stick. Then we found out it was just lights from the street behind her. oh MY GOD LOL. Then we chilled out. Threw stuff at Bob's ceiling fan. And went to bed. We woke up, cleanedt he kitchen and Bob took us to Barns and Noble.&nbsp; We got a book on Skinwalker ranch. MY SECOND FAVORITE :D. Then we went ot Chili's where i saw my bff John again ^^

My brother ran into my room and started shooting us with his pellet gun. He made Asley cry rofl. Then Shelby came over. We chilled and played Guitar Hero. <br />Saturday:<br />Slept, then woke up and walked around my neighborhood.&nbsp; Shelby and Ashley went into the woods and Shelby pissed and it was very rofl. Then&nbsp; Ashley had to leave. I had a tennis lesson with Conrad. And it kinda surprised me how much he cares about me. That one time I completely broke down on the court and started to cry, he was there, trying to cheer me up. He even gave me a rose, aw. But, I basically told him what was up. This was at least two weeks ago. So, Shelby helped out at my lesson and it was fun. Then we went home, and went to friendly's. Then after that her dad came and picked us up and took us to Springfield Plaza. We did some major uber cosplay shopping. FUNFUN. Really, it was. We went to K-mart and Joeyz and like...ghetto stores rofl. Then Shelby's phonr broke, and I didn't have mine, so we were stranded in downtown springfield....at 9:30...at night...while it was pouring -___-; Then we went back to her house. We watched Sailor Moon and had some BK<br />Sunday: Woke up, had waffles, and like...chilled. Then went to taco Bell rofl. <br /><br />All and all, it was a good pity party weekend. I'm looking forward to this weekend because....ASHLEY GOT SEASON ONE OF TIM AND ERIC AWESOME SHOW GREAT JOB ON DVD.<br />Dude, I'm not even lying. I can't resist posting a picture of them on here because I love them so much.<br /><a href=""http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s137/slimjaxn/comics/timhiedeckerericwareheim.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s137/slimjaxn/comics/timhiedeckerericwareheim.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />YAY I LUV THEM<br /><br />ANYWAY<br /><br />So, like. I'm getting over Paul. It was hard, but it's ok. It's a part of life. He just doesn't know what he gave up. And i kinda feel bad about the fact that I think I already like someone? But you know, i'm gonna wait until the summer. I need to chill out and cool off. i'll have to see what I can do, though. I doubt it'll work rofl. But, I wanna wait until I'm completely over Paul before i just jump on in thar. But, hey. He was a great guy. He treated me like a princess, and i'm gonna miss him until the end of forever, but man. He's just gone.<br /><br />So, like. Matthew's done with school. He's graduating soon. It's hard to believe he's done. He really only has a month left before we have to ship him off to Colorado to the USAFA. I'm gonna miss that boy. We're having a Graduation/ Going away party for him on June 21, stop by if you like him. I'm gonna cry, man ]:"

"event","When two people break up, there shouldn't be sides. So, why does it feel like there is?
I mean, I've either asked, or got the general idea of who is on my side and who is on Paul's.
LET'S SEE
Paul's : Tiffany, Nora, Stefano,&nbsp; basically everyone that's my friend that ALL OF A SUDDEN likes Paul more
Undecided: Ashley and Shelby...What The Fuck.
My side: ANTHONY FERRIERA. YEAH OK. Thanks. 


Now, as you can obviously see, I have no basis for this besides my own observations and asking. But, what pisses me off is that, he just goes off and breaks my heart and apparently HE'S the victim. And everyone feels bad for HIM. Um, hello? I have to deal with the fact that my boyfriend of a year and a half, that I JUST wasted half of my high school career with just BROKE MY HEART. And apparently I'm being called a ""bitch"" behind my back by Paul.&nbsp; Which is totally justified, because HE BREAKS UP WITH ME, GOES TO SCHOOL, IGNORES ME, AND COMPLETELY DENIES MY EXISTENCE.&nbsp; YEAH I'M TOTALLY THE ONE AT FAULT. LET'S GO CONSOLE HIM AND MAKE ME FEEL LIKE SHIT.
You know what? If I had known all of this was going to happen, I never woulda went out with him. Because he went from being my knight in shining armor to the biggest jerk I've ever met. IN LITERALLY ONE NIGHT. 

I don't get it. I'm just feeling to shitty right now. A lot of people who I thought were my friends just ditched me to be on Paul's side.&nbsp; This isn't how I wanted things to be. At all. I called him Sunday night and talked to him. I told him things shouldn't be awkward, because even if I still love him, it's all okay. And in school, we'll be fine. AND HE AGREED.&nbsp; Now he's just being like this to me, and he's taking my friends away. 

Man, i seriously just want to like...die. Not to be all emo, but just to make them all feel bad. Like, if I could pull a disappearing act, I would.

I've had a few days to recover and I'm doin' alright. Paul's just ignoring me in school. I try to talk to him, but he just ignores me and acts like he doesn't even know me. I still gotta give him his stuff back, meh. He said I could keep his Game cube, which I'm not complaining about. I love that thing. I still feel really controlled by anxiety. Like, this is all new to me, and when this happens, my anxiety takes over and I go crazy. And my meds haven't been working lately, and I've been doin stuff I shouldn't be doing. But, if it helps, go for it, right? I'm just wicked excited for summer. AND CTCON! :D Shelby and I are going as Sumomo and Kotoko from Chobits. It's gonna be WICKED CUUUTTTEEEE. Ashley's still gonna be Integra, and i don't remember who Amy said she was going to go as, but it was form Hellsing.
Actually, we have a cool project in Religion. Ashley, Shelby and I have to put a skit together based on one of the stories from the Bible. And we're doing the Ten Bridesmaids. And there was like 5 stupid ones and 5 smart ones. The smart ones remembered oil and the dumb ones didn't. We need to make it modern, so we're changing the wedding to a rave, and the dumb one forgot the glow sticks and the smart ones didn't. AND THEN AT THE END WE'RE GONNA RAVE :D So it's gonna be like...Anime Boston, encept no drunks, no Rachel,&nbsp; no Tokyo Pinsalocks, and in Ms. Krupa's room. 
And my hands been hurting me ever since I got that cyst drained. Like, you can still srsly see the needle hole and like, it's still popping. My dad told me to wait a few days before calling the doctor to make my surgery date, but it's still definite that I need it. I'll probably wait a few more days and see if it's still popping.

I need surgery.
And I'm basically out for the rest of the season.
My week in a nut shell.

Let's go in order!
So, I hurt my hand a while ago. I've had this mysterious bump on it for a while. It was really annoying. We'll get back to that later. Paul had been acting really weird lately. And i like called him out on it. And he broke up with me. GO YOU. Man, I'm pissed at him, but I still love him. So, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. And i have a TON of his stuff which i need to give back. I don't really want to give it back, but whatever. And like, he gave me all this jewelry and i don't even know what to do with it now. I don't wanna wear it, but I don't wanna get rid of it. And i have all these plushies and cards and drawings and shit. I wish he didn't do this. I really didn't. But, obviously if he's ready to move on, then so am I. But what pisses me off is HE was the one who was so strong about us being together forever. He never wanted to let me go, he never wanted to leave. Then he just breaks up with me. That hurts, dude. 
Ok, well back to my hand. I have had this weird bump on it for a while and it's been really annoying because it pops and whatnot. WELL, I go to an orthopedic doctor today and I find out i need surgery. I'd kinda happy, but I'm pissed I may not be able to work for the summer. Man, I hate life."

That's right. Here I am, still playing first doubles. Never knowing what will happen next. It'd be great if we had a set thing going, If he said, ""For the rest of the season, it's you and Meg. Unless there is a challenge match"" I'd be happy! I love Meggie Poo, a lot. She's the sweetest thing in the world, and I don't wanna leave out duo behind, but don't promise me a singles spot by saying, ""Oh, yeah. You can play singles sometime, since you won. I'll have you practice with the singles players during practice"" Then not following through! It's so immature and it's not a responsible thing to do as a coach! Don't lie to your players, it's not a good way to get on their good side.

Anyway, I just spent the entire weekend with Ashley, again. I love that girl. But like, Last night she was all happy and on the phone with Roland, then she gets off the phone with him literally 3 seconds later and she's crying. I swear. That boy is/ makes her bipolar. One minute they love each other, then they're being all emo and fighting. Honestly, Paul I cannot thank you enough for being like that because if you were, I would have killed you by now. But, I love you anyway.

I've been feeling weird feelings lately. I don't wanna go into too much detail, but I've been missing a lot of people. Like, to the point where all I do is sit in my room, listen to songs that remind me of them/ that time, and mope around. Well, i can't really mope ""around"" in my room, if you've seen it, you know why. I mope on my bed. That works. Oh, by the way, I finally moved my ass and read my drivers book thingy, so I'm gonna get my permit this week. And, I just realized I need to apply for that job at C-money's camp. GREAT. I'm gonna get one good thing out of it: Money. NOTHING LIKE MINIMUM WAGE. I'll probably use it to buy a DS. I NEED one.

I've also decided that I'm going to make art my main priority. But, only when I'm failing at tennis. Because tennis can suck my left nut. Art can be my best friend every day :]"

"event","Jerry Springer has once again completely amazed me in terms of hilarity and utter craziness.

Todays Episode: ""Bizarre Secret Affairs""

A fat middle-aged man who spoke in a mysteriously gay voice, was telling his finace that he was having an affair with a woman he met at, of all places, Bingo.
Seconds later, a VERY old woman in a wheelchair connected to a FUCKING RESPIRATOR is wheeled out onto the stage.
I nearly choked.
Watching the living dead attempting to get across the stage is funny.
What would have made this completely perfect, is if the guy's finace punched the old woman. I dont think she would have survived.
Some good audience comments:
""What are you going to do when your having sex with her and she has a heart attack?""
""I just wanted to know, when your having sex, does she need the wheelchair?""

Ive been stuck at home with a fucking terrible flu. Blocked nose, blocked ears, sore throat, the whole package."

Today's Episode: Baby, I Lied!
3 women the size of horses each had their own problem where their boyfriend had kids with other women.
The funniest parts: 
A mentally disabled woman wearing a mini-skirt confronted her boyfriend's mistress. She could not stop spitting on herself when she talked, and was completely out of breath after each sentence.
Later on an audience member told her to ""Keep her mouth shut, because it demeans her.""

A really bulky transvestite was going out with another man for over 6 years. They get engaged, and the she-man announces to it's fiance that it's a man.
Funnily enough, the guy never noticed that he was going out with a man. A few camera sweeps to the transvestite's feet reveal ungodly sized Size 12 shoes.
Perhaps the poor fellow should have noticed those giant feet before the transvestite had oral sex with him.

Battlefield 1942 is the most World War II related fun ive had since Medal Of Honour.
Flying a plane directly into an enemy soldier then ejecting at the last second is fucking hilarious, because then you get a nice view of the innocent person getting crushed by a large piece of flying metal.
Just dont forget to use your parachute, unless youd like to become friends with the ground. Some <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2002-08-21&res=l"">illustration</a> will help you remember.

An equally fun, although graphically challenged game goes by the name of <a href=""http://www.soldat.prv.pl/"">Soldat</a>. Think Worms Armageddon crossed with Counterstrike with fun powerups. Going Rambo-style on your opponents and embedding arrows into their skull is satisfying to say the least.

Optus has stuffed up the Netstats once again. The daily average has jumped from 45MB to an oversized 200MB. This i have notice by the fact that after a download total of 1GB in one day, my netstats only rose by .5. Although no major broadband related news site has reported it, i would rather keep it private news so i can continue leeching.
I have also uncapped my modem. It now is capable of speeds of over 5MB/s. Unfortunately, i cant always keep it uncapped, because Optus can find out within hours. Just an hour a day or less is enough.

Thats the end of my incredibly long post.
Im going to crawl back into bed and attempt to get over my sickness."

I just HAD to get that copy of Unreal Tournament 2003.
The FTP was constantly being hammered, so I just sat there. Waiting....
Eventually it got done, so I was allowed to get some sleep.

Of course I would not have woken up this morning without my good friend, Coke."

"event","A multitude of problems have popped up from the filth that those Korean's made, Ragnarok Online.
Items have been bought for $20 from NPC's in game and being sold back to the NPC's for $250,000. Say bye-bye to the Economy.
Merchants that are selling any of their items are only getting $20 for them, even if the advertised price is higher.
Half of the Server is STILL down because they were ""incorrectly linked"" to other parts of the server, resulting in complete newbies being teleported to the hardest area of the game.
And while all of this has been happening, the servers have been going offline and online every 5 minutes.

"event","As <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/theologue/"">Brad</a> so calmly pointed out, the Servers have been delayed again for <a href=""http://www.ragnarokonline.com/"">Ragnarok</a>.
Seems those Korean's cant stick to their promises.
They pushed back the release date for the Beta 2 Client, they took down the server's for ""Maintenance"" a whole week earlier, and now they're delaying the servers.
When people who cant speak english attempt to create a Multiplayer Game, good things never happen.

Update:

Well, who would have EVER guessed.
2 patches have already been released for Ragnarok Beta 2 even though no-one has played it yet. The first one got corrupted by the smart Koreans who put it on their server, and the second one renders you unable to connect to the server, with a friendly little message saying ""run ragnarok.exe"", even thought its already running.

Korean Masterminds at work."

Went to a Net Cafe today and played Warcraft III all day.
Best thing to do if your in danger of loosing your Base:
Scatter your remaining Peons all over the map, then regroup them
at one point later in the game. The enemy will have absolutely no Idea where to look for them, and you get at least 4 more chances to build a new base.
Just make sure you have a sufficient amount of Gold.

HONOUR THY BLADE"

BLAH!

this time last week, rachel overdosed, then she slit her wrists on monday evening. so much has happened over the past week. 

i have taken to writing again which is always a bad thing as it means depression is settling in my skin again. never gone, always lurking. shadows. no stars, just shadows.

she runs through the street like a camel on sand
she makes everyone look and everyone stare

she sees things differently from you and me
she makes everything all creamy and light 
and she sits with the stars all through the night

she isn't quite perfect but she rarely fails,
she hugs her cigarette in hands with chipped nails,
she drinks vodka from the cap chasing it with coke

she is a butterfly, one of a kind

Written about Monday, September 2nd 

i met heather in mcd's at liverpool street. she was sitting by the window, her blonde hair resting on her shoulders. i dragged her into a photobooth and pulled her onto my lap as she complained about the bright white background of the booth. we sat and laughed at the stupidness of the pictures we took until we managed to get one we both liked and it now sits in the clear back of my bus pass holder. we made our way to oxford street and browsed the shops looking for a top for miss heather to wear that night. she found one, a revealing red halter neck that i was allowed to see in the changing rooms, my eyes fixed on her breasts, freed from her bra and in this wonderful clingy red top. it hugged the curves of her breasts and the peak of her nipples as i wanted my hands to. i loved it. we then made our way back to my house, where we agreed to watch the fast and the furious. she drank her diet coke and me my apple tango and we sat on the sofa. i offered my body as a pillow and she lay with her head in my lap, her hair sprawled across my leg. she held my hand as it lay on her chest. and i could see inside her playboy top and i studied the curve of her breast for sometime. pure beauty. every so often she would turn her head towards me to talk to me and she looked so amazing and heavenly and fragile and beautiful her hand clasping mine and i wanted to lean down and kiss her soft lips, oh how i wanted to, but the thud of my heart beat made my cheeks flush with heat at the thought of getting it wrong. throughout the film i cradled her face as she hid from the gore and stroked her head and played with her untainted hair and stroked her ribs and gently placed my hand on her breast, my heart skipping a beat as i tried to keep breathing. as the film finished, i went to the toilet and returned to find her sitting up, knees curled up to her chest and i asked for a hug. i didn't want to let her go, i did, eventually only to hug her soon again. i lay my head on her outstretched arm and closed my eyes. perfection. sitting up i kissed her forehead and bent down to kiss her cheek, kissing her lips on a detour, refusing to stop. her lips so soft and delicate, her kiss so beautiful and full of care. my heart was racing as our tongues touched and i didn't want it to end, so nervous, so excited, so overwhelmed. as our lips parted she tucked her head under my chin and i held her, utterly wowed by what had just happened. we had let go of reality as we were indulging in each other and nothing mattered but the stars i saw in her eyes. i kissed her once more on the sofa, my hand reaching again for her perfectly rounded breast and i could feel the electricity crackling in the room as i touched her. i pulled her up from the sofa and we stood together and kissed for the last time that day, i wanted to let my hands explore her whole body but these kisses were making me dizzy with longing for her. miss heather. her body. i wanted her to be mine. all mine. i could feel how horny i was having stood up and i wasn't surprised. we hugged before we left the house and managed to get to the train station very late. which was my fault for us getting the wrong train. i was sad to leave her as she disappeared into a crowd of people on the platform... all the way home i was in a total trance. under her spell. entranced by her entire being. nothing else mattered but the perfectness of those room-spinning kisses and i dreamt of so much more that night.

I am glad I can get out of this rotting hole called hell.. my fateful appointment next week shall open the door to a new world. one of pomegranates and dark lords, not secondy checkidies and scheduled lunches. I can never make up my mind, but I know something now. I want out.

I found myself in ally pally today, I wrote in a new journal type thingy for 11 long sides of A4. it was nice. I sat in the sun by the boating lake, I watched the skaters for ages and ages and ages, I watched the deer and sat on the grass for quite a while too. but I couldn't not sit and admire the view of London from that height. The trees have grown since I last stopped to look though. I generally had a nice time, getting things out of my head and embracing the world around me as well as shunning some of it. I'm glad I actually did something with my time too. I feel that I have somehow accomplished something. odd. 

I went to whsmiths and found absolutely SHITLOADS of stationary I want to buy, I'll have to budget though because its like this every year. 

stationary is my vice. it really is."

i've been thinking alot about people and memories and vintage belongings and fantasies. i finished price caspian last night. went to sleep at 1:45 am but stil managed to miss calls from miss heather. 

my mum said she'll take me shopping to brent cross on thursday. tomorrow i have to begin clearing out my rooms fro the gas men to come and do their thang. i think i am going to volunteer to help out at oxfam for some of the week. a nice little something to keep my mind occupied. 

i got a letter from katrina today. she was right... i wouldn't apreciate it and it <b>did</b> sound like she was having a go at me. but i refuse to be moody about it. i just thought she would be different... and she was. but everyone is . . . . . . . .    human. i guess.

i am surrounded by beautiful people with beautiful faces and beautiful words and beautiful friends when i myself am ugly and torn. 

i have never felt so out of place, yet so complete at the same time. something strange has happened inside of me. 'yeh... sex' those two words have changed a million and one things about myself and i am beginning to see that i will be damned forever in this hypocrisy.

in a way i beg that things will be bad again by Friday, so i might actually get the help i need. but i don't want this to ever end. i feel like i am skating upon a path of paper thin stars made of glittering ice that call out with a sigh as my blade slashes through their tiny beings one by one. a continuous moan of effervescent pleasure. i share in their relief. like orgasms rippling through my body.

in truth i am but another hideous and deformed creature longing to be accepted by the beautiful people in hope they can make me into what they are.

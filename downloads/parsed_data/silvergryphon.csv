Was able to get onto Scattergood last night via javascript.  Bleah.  I was reminded of how much I hate that thing . . . and how much I miss my client!

"event","The bad news is that my desktop computer has decided for the thirty-third time that it can no longer survive the world, has given me multiple blue screens of death, and has died.  I don't quite trust it to boot it up and work on it.  I suppose I'll try to get on in a bit and try to salvage some files, but pretty much I've given up on it, poor thing.

So what am I typing on, you ask?  A laptop!  :)  No, not a new one by any means.  But it connects to the internet, has Word, and is sufficient for my meager needs.  I only tend to need the Internet, AIM, and Word as of late.  I don't quite trust it with a MOO program yet, so I have to think about that, but at least I have something reasonably stable for the time being.  Dad says that Windows NT is supposed to be a pretty stable operating system.  It takes forever to boot up and to shut down, but I'm pretty happy with it.  :)  And as a completely random note, I love the sound the keyboard makes as I type.  Reminds me of rain dripping onto the roof.

Must decide how to wreak havoc today.  Yes.  I might try to finish the post for Papillion that I was working on.  It's sad, but I think it will turn out well.  No one wants to play Ryo, so this'll be my way of getting him out of the way.  Poor guy.  :)  Ah, well, he'll survive.  I can use him as a npc.

I probably should have done this in your comments box, Yume-chan, but I'll put this here whilst I'm thinking about it.  Available characters are as follows.  I'll warn you now that they're mostly guys.  If you don't feel comfortable playing a guy, let me know and we'll work something out.  Be honest if you're not comfortable.  ;P

-I have a few masurao that have no one to play them, and I can't handle myself.  (Currently I'm playing all of them except for one.  @_@)  Masurao are the bodyguards of the senshi, bonded to their duties and usually forming close relationships with their senshi.  See me if you want a bit of a better definition, but that's the basic part of it.  :)  Among the available:  Tenjiro (Uranus no masurao and the commander of the group), Alec (Venus no masurao), and Ryo (Mercury no masurao) -- who I won't get rid of if you want him.

-Some of the senshi on Sol's side don't have masurao either.  Those who don't are Hespera, Aurora, Nyx, and Nova, to my knowledge.  I don't *think* I've missed one?  o.o  So many names.  Gah.

-Umi has some senshi of her own creation that she's trying to handle by herself.  Correct me if I'm wrong, Umi-chan, and these aren't available . . .  Venus and Uranus?  See her if you're interested in them.  :)

And if you don't like any of these options, like I said, we can work something out, so feel free to ask.  :)

Let's see . . . not much else to offer the journal in the way of news.  Have a week left off.  Sigh.  Time goes too quickly.  I have yet to finish Escaflowne.  Seh-chan tried to tell me the end last night.  Or at least cackled about it.  Doom to you, Seh-chan.  >.>

Tried to rent the Breakfast Club today.  Unfortunately I found out that it was rated R and the stupid membership was set up before I was old enough to watch R movies.  Thus the card does not permit me to check them out.  This irritates me . . . bleah.  Not worth losing sleep over, though.  I'll get to it eventually.  What really does irritate me is that I wasted money on The Musketeer (I'm not even going to *begin* on how bad that was) and Chocolat (I haven't seen it yet, but our neighbor already had the movie and was going to let us borrow it for free.  --;).  So that's about seven bucks gone . . .  Movies are so expensive any more.

You're excited about life and in touch with yourself and nature. Tell me, do I have this straight?

Virtues: You appreciate humor like none other. Puns might even spark laughter in you (TEHY R FUNNI). You seek adventure and connection with your surroundings. You seek friends who will not only share laughs with you but actually form a deep bond of trust and empathy beneath the surface. You look for adventure and courage in people, and variation is necessary to keep you under control. You see yourself as multi-faceted, so you need people who can see you in your many lights. You're constantly trying to figure yourself out while analyzing the people around you. Silly, silly people.

Aspirations: You can't decide what you want to be yet, but you know you want it to be adventures and interesting, with constant changes. You don't know what love will do for you yet, but it's competing with adventure for a place in your heart. An internal conflict has begun: can you be a successful worker, lover, and parent all at once?

Quirks: Noise of any sort is irritating when you're in the mood. Smacking gum, loud chewing, humming- it's about as pleasing as bodily noises. You dislike emaciated people because of jealousy and just plain disgust. You're a procrastinator but a hard worker, too.

Factors: You need constant attention and support. You're high-maintnence, but a great, reliable friend. Nature needs you and you need nature; it's helped thus far, so keep in touch with the outside world.

Future: Who knows! You absolutely need constant change, so vacationing is surely in the cards. Will you settle down or not? Love will find you eventually, as it does to everyone. Will you choose the sweet home life or the rewarding busy-bee life?


More later, perhaps . . ."

"event","Dreamed this again last night.  I have a very odd recurring place in my dreams . . .  The dream itself differs, but always the place is the same, and my feelings about it never change.

The place is a cave, dark and deep.  For a little while I can see where I am going, but then I can see no longer.  I must find the way to the end in pitch blackness punctuated occasionally by spurts of daylight in the middle (though those are rare).  It is easy to get lost in this cave, as it twists and turns and contains directions that can lead me on the wrong path, and always there are these sounds -- growling, almost -- that make it seem like something is about to jump on me.

Two times I've found my way through this cave, but still it continues to reappear.  Always for some reason I'm needing to go through it.  I'm no longer wanting (not that I did in the first place, but I did) to grope my way through it.  If dreams have meaning, I'm wondering what this means . . ."

<b>I Am A:</b> Chaotic Neutral Elf Fighter Bard
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Chaotic Neutral</b> characters are unstable, and frequently insane. They believe in disorder first and foremost, and will thus strive for that disorder in everything they do. This means that they will do whatever seems 'fun' or 'novel' at any given time.
<br><br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Fighters</b> are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Bards</b> are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.
<br><br><u>Deity:</u><br><b>Fenmarel Mestarine</b> is the Chaotic Neutral elven god of outcasts and isolation. He is also known as the Lone Wolf. His followers are outcasts (either by force or by choice) from elven society, and believe in being self-sufficient. Their preferred weapon is the dagger. Fenmarel Mestarine's symbol is a pair of elven eyes in the darkness.

Big good news of the day . . . I got a 100 on my psych essay about the small children I had to go interview!!  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaai!!  *grabs the nearest random person and dances*  :D

I've also been offered a job at a library near home for the summer.  I have to pass a drug test (O.o;) and a page test, but the lady said she wouldn't hire anyone else unless I didn't pass.  She doesn't think I'll have a problem.  I'm not too sure what the page test is . . .  I think it's putting Dewey decimals in order and such.  I can handle that, if that's what it is.

Trying the Hogwarts moo thing again.  Still surprised that someone missed me . . .  Ah, well.  Passed a reasonably good evening . . . some aspects of the place are pretty much the same though.  Heh.  Guess I couldn't expect that much.  Perhaps someday some people will figure out how to be nice.

Still working on Scattergood.  Describing rooms in buildings, planning feasts and such.  It's perhaps an odd thing, but I love it when I feel useful . . . when I can have a hand in my environment and someone cares about what I do . . .

I need more sleep, though . . .  I've been getting to bed too late and not getting up as well as I should in the mornings.  I'm feeling drowsy in my classes -- even the one whose lectures always just fly by . . .  Must get more sleep.

Tis all for now . . . if I think of other things, I can put them in later.  :)"

The first one was mild, softer-spoken, and honestly rather boring in his presentation, although I think his facts were better and the whole presentation was better put together.  The points he argued were clear and concise from my point of view, each flowing into the other smoothly.  The other man, however, was certainly livelier, yet he jumped from subject to subject, speaking very quickly.  He was ostentatious both in manner and the ""politeness"" he deferred to his colleague.

Rather funny, though, at the end they were allowed to rebut one another's arguments.

"event","About the same today.  Slept late, then dragged myself out of bed.  I'm starting to wonder if I was meant to hibernate . . .

Drove over and did some shopping.  Got a few things -- of course not what I was looking for.  :)  Ah, well.

I finished a little project I was working on . . . I don't know if I'm fully pleased with it.  I may have to redo a bit of it and retouch it here and there.  I hope it will work.

The cat has been stalking my lap tonight.  I'll be sitting here, typing, when all of a sudden I notice that she's about ready to spring on top of me.  Panic and chaos ensue.  *looks over at her cat*  She may look innocent right now, but hah.  I know what she's really thinking.  :)

*cough*  That was random . . .  :)  Well, other than those things, not much tonight . . . it's quiet.  I guess I'll go back to creating a character and trying to fix my selector . . ."

"event","Well, I've actually managed to top myself . . .  I slept until noon.  I have the feeling that I was awake (or at least conscious) beforehand -- however, I think I just closed my eyes and dropped off again.  Oi . . .  I think I need more sleep.

I've finished Kitaeru!  :)  I'm very pleased with her.  The pose didn't come out at all the way I was expecting -- it's actually a very simple one -- but she still looks good.  Now if I can just get Kokie to work.

I talked to Blue-chan last night (beware, I'm color-coding people now) for the first time in . . . a while.  It was good.  She sounded a little distracted at times, but it was still good to talk to her.  Unfortunately she had to go help with something before we could quite finish, but we'll try again soon.  Much catching up to do.

Let's see . . . not much else at the moment.  It's been a quiet day.  I'm going to try to fix my selector again.  It will work, I tell you!  :)  So . . . I'll go give that a try.  Ja mata ne."

"event","I don't seem to make it out of bed earlier than eleven lately . . .  This is a problem, for I feel like I miss half my day.  However, bed is so warm, and I'm always in just the right spot . . .  Sigh.

Went out for lunch today, then rented two movies:  Tootsie and While You Were Sleeping.  Both were good.  :)  I really loved the main character in the latter.

My picture of Kokie/Shukuen is frustrating me at the moment, so I'm trying Kitaeru.  She's coming out pretty well.  So far she has her father's hair (color and style) and her mother's jawline and eyes.  Head is done; time to work on the body.  In my mind she needs kind of a playful pose, but we'll see what works best.  :)

*yawns*  Very tired . . . getting a little frustrated . . . should probably get that thing they call sleep.  Oyasumi nasai."

vicky's birthday was yesterday. we had a really nice time celebrating here. she seemed to like her presents :) i still can't believe she is 8!!!! we got her a cute vanity for her room and some other odds and ends. 

james is trying out for guys and dolls on saturday here in town. they are only taking kids 14-24.... so its like a real audition.... not everyone gets a part. been busy helping him get ready for that. 

this next week is dustin's spring break.... the other kids are off in april. it'll be nice having one on one time with dusty. he is loving his new school :) 

otherwise, i've been busy doing a million things as usual. craig and i are looking forward to some time alone this weekend. having so many sick kids around the past few weeks, i am just so spent. we might go see a movie tonight :) 

lee is coming over on sunday. it'll be nice to see him again! its been waaaaaaaaay too long!"

"event","so... i had a lovely morning with my dear friend kerri...  i met her at her place to check out her new color scheme and changes to her house them we went for coffee.

so, i'm on my way back hom when craig calls me. 

erin called him this morning to tell him that she has lumps in her neck again  (yes, erin, that's bound to happen when you do chemo but don't follow up with radiation treatment like you doctor recommended  )

so, she is FREAKING out, but i am actually very proud of her because she called him to offer a proposal of sorts: 

as of june first, we are no longer obligated to pay her car payment any longer. we have not been paying her medical insurance for some time now (since a little after chemo ended) so basically, we pay her $750 a month alimony and she is SUPPOSED to pay half the kids' medical expenses. 

she never does, but every month i give her a copy of all receipts and her half of the running total. 

this is her proposal: 

she has to make less than $800 a month to get on medicaid to get treatment for cancer (her insurance she has thru her work now does not cover pre-existing conditions) so.... she is planning on sutting down to 4 days a week

us not pay her alimony

us pay her car payment ($350)

with the $400 left ($750 alimony) put towards her running balance she owes us for kids medical bills and keep it going to pay for future until she is done with cancer treatment and can get of medicaid.

we think this sounds pretty good and she brought up having it drawn up and she would sign anything.... craig will have it notarized. she is really freaking out. she KNOWS she did this to herself too. 

she called back to make sure we don't say anything to the kids. DUH!!! she doesn't even know yet if this is what it is! it COULD just be a gland thing... but with her history... probably not likely....

i feel bad for her, but we all knew this would be happening sooner or later. 

i am dreading the kids finding out and i really do feel badly for her. she must be so scared right now."

we also got a great deal on a patio set, so now we have somewhere to sit at the new house until all of our furnature comes in about 2 weeks :) its really nice! 

both of our sets of parents came over this weekend which was really nice and karen and jeff came over too. my dad thanked craig for taking such good care of his little girl :) the dogs love the new place. the ran around the whole time! i think they'll be very disappointed once we get furniture! 

we've decided on paint colors and the painters get started this friday :) 

i started lining the drawers, etc.... it's all very exciting :) 

we even sampled a bottle of fallbrook's winery's finest... not too bad :) 

both chicken pox boys are going to school today :) i have soooo much to do, this is coming at the perfect time! 

i'm excited to be seeing my friend kari today :) i miss her very much.

**************

stephen is starting to show signs of the pox. dustin still has some blisters but most are starting to scab. he is so miserably itchy :( poor monkey :( while we drove to the new house yesterday, the three of us had marvelous conversations about religion, social issues, homosexuality, racism, WW2, what movie stars i have crushes on (?), and how they most admire how much i care about finding the good in all people, tolerance for people, and my willingness to help people... even those who might have done me wrong. 

pretty big topics for pox filled chikens :) 

craig has had a very stressful munth at work. so glad its just about done. yesterday was the last day to sign.... so i guess it just all starts over again. that and the stress of the new house.... he isjust spent :( 

i miss my mom :( i'm excited for them to get back from cancun. 

i have a moving company coming over today to give me an estimate on moving us. this should be interesting. it shouldn't be too bad since we're not taking all that much stuff with us... 

i am soooo excited that my long lost friend erika has found me here on LJ!!!! we were pen pals through high school and college.... she from sumner, wa now living in iceland! we were very close and i am just thrilled to be back in touch! she has stayed close with another mutual pen pal, shaina in florida, so i am excited to get back in touch with her too! :) the only one of my many pen pals i never lost contact with was mandy in toronto.... we might have not written for a few months at a time..... but we still keep in touch mostly through email :)"

we bought a ton of furniture this past weekend. we're still in shock about it all. we got a diningroom set with 10 chairs, our bedroom st (cal king bed frame), familyroom sectional with a big ass ottoman and living room sofa, love seat and my chair with otoman. 

we had never in our lives spent that much money at once..... but how awesome is it that we finally can :) 

went and saw the interpreter with l and a saturday night. good movie. bummer... j might have actually GONE to this one since nicole kidman is in it!

we are getting the kids a cellphone for when they are at their mom's house. her only phone is HER cellphone... and since she will be working every day when the kids are there, we'll feel MUCH better knowing they can get a hold of someone if they need to. 

we'll also pass it around to the kids afterwards if any of them are out with their friends, etc..... i think it's a good idea :)

terri , jean, lisa.... if you need to borrow it to see if it is worth getting or not, just say the word! it is freaking amazing!!!!

ok... saturday we went with the j's to the huntington.... we had a blast! poor vicky got sick towards the end... but she was a trooper! 

sunday, we took the kids to go see the new house, and they LOVE it! they all want to move NOW! we drove around and showed them the schools they will be going to. the avocado festival was going on, so we couldn't show them too much of downtown, but they did like it :) there were a few kids playing in the neighborhood when we were there, so they were happy to se that too! 

we close mar 22nd... so we'll have a month to get thngs together before we move in :)

"event","on friday, i got my hair cut and i LOVE it!!!!! its a short bob cut... and i died it burgundy... my normal color. i feel like a princess!

craig and i had a super fun weekend. we dropped off the kids friday night with erin. here were the highlights of THAT:

timothy kept yelling over and over again that ""mommy died her hair the same color megan does!!!""

timothy wouldn't let go of me and kept saying ""don't make me go with her, i want to stay with you and daddy.""

vicky attached her hand to my hip and kept saying that it was stuck and she couldn't let go. when mom wasn't paying attention to her about this, she yelled ""Mom, my hand is stuck to megan and i can't let go!!""

so, then the older kids started having their normal fight over who will sit in the front seat going up the hill. normally, erin just stands there while they do this, so finally i jump in and tell them where to sit.

this time, i did not engage. we stood there for the beginning of it, then said goodbye and walked to our car. 

we got the dogs out and walked them over to some grass to go potty. then they played with another dog that was there, then we went back to the car. when we drove off (10 min later) they STILL haddn't left! aye carrumba!

so, then we went to a nice dinner with karen and jeff in temecula. it was nice to break up the drive on to victorville. 

we went to maria and mike's wedding on saturday and that was really nice. i got to hold a beautiful month old baby during most of the reception :) 

we went back to victorville and went to dinner at the club with my parents. all you can eat shrimp and prime rib. yum!

the kids called us sat night. it was nice talking to them :) 

sunday, we took my mom and grandma out to lunch after taking craig to the ER AGAIN for him mouth issues. they FINALLY gave him an antibiotic and antiiflamitory. 

we stopped by fallbrook on the way to picking up the kids :) i just love it there :) 

when we picked up the kids, craig asked erin if she could watch the kids for the week we will be on our cruise to the carribean with craig's work. SHE SAID YES!!!!! 

she is moving (yet again) this week to her mother's 5th wheel, because the guy who owns the one she has been living in needs his back. this one is smaller and reaks of cigarette smoke, so i'm not too excited about it. 

oh yeah, but she's back on her feet! *rollseyes*"

"event","so, we go to pick up the kids yesterday from their weekend with erin and erin locks her keys in her car. 

i go from shop to shop in the center trying to find someone with a coathanger..... no luck. 

so, i suggest we go back home, get a hanger and bring it to her. 

craig went back on his own to help her while i got the kids ready for bed. they got the door open pretty quickly... then erin started in....

she says all the kids but timothy (8) are telling her they want to live with her and we need to figure out what is happening next school year!?!?!??!?!

craig almost lost it, and, in turn, so did i. 

a lot of stuff went back and forth between them.... he showed her how eventhough she paid him $132 on friday for the kids medical, she still owes us over $400 to get her up to date just from the past 2 months alone. she said to him ""you really think i can pay you this?!?!?""

um, ok.... but you want to take care of them full time!!!?!?!?

she threw back in his face that he is rarely home (because of working to make enough money for her and us) so she doesn't want the kids to be raised by a non-bio parent (me).... 

there was a lot more..... i'm just too mad to go into it now...

so, he got home and told me all about it. i got very upset. we sat all the kids down and craig told them he and mom talked about this and he wanted to know what they were feeling. what they said was that when they are with her, they miss her and in the moment they do feel like they want to live with her. they are confused and scared to make thast decision and hurt anyone's feelings. 

SHE has been the one all along telling them they will be able to decide who they live with.... we keep telling her its not fair to them to make them decide that.... but she doesn't care. 

stephen (12) brought up that he talked to his therapist about it... about wanting to live with mom because he misses her and the therapist said ""well, if you lived with her, you would miss dad and megan."" 

so, what we got out of it was that they want to see their mom more and are afraid they never know when they will see her again so thats why they want to live with her. 

craig called her and told her this conversation and she said she was glad the kids felt better to know that the decision is off their heads. he also told her we would try to figure something out for her to see them more, but to me, its up to her, not us!!! she is supposed to see them more as it is, but doesn't!!!!!

i am so hurt and upset..... having a hard time sorting through my emotions. 

i felt better after we talked to the kids, but i feel like all i do for them doesn't matter because they ultimately want that time with their mom and dad. i feel like a stand-in. 

stephen wet the bed last night :( 

craig is all out of sorts and questioning is new position at work because the kids miss him so much since he's gine a lot more... but if he doesn't do this job, we will never get out of debt. 

i was just in vicky's class this moring like always and she did not want me to leave. she was begging me :( 

it just sucks."

we started making out easter cards and they look fabulous. the kids are having a lot of fun with them. i'm still not feeling 100%... but everyday i'm inching closer. 

other than that, i'm starting to get the house ready for vicky's party and easter.... we're going to disneyland easter day, but the day before is vicky's party here and all our relatives are coming over here later that day to celebrate her birthdya, easter, etc.... should be fun!"

"event","so... ya'll know that i have been dying all week with my massive sinus infection from hell.... not being able to breathe and bronchitis.... 

erin called like normal on monday..

erin called on wednesday, but one of the kids had accidentally turned the ringer on the phone to OFF so we never heard her call. she had left a message saying she would try to call thurs afternoon....

*I* left her a message thursday telling her the best time to call thurs would be at 3:15 and i told her why we didn't get her call.

she called at 3:35 thursday. timothy answered and she asked him to give the phone to me. she told me she was heading to san diego and was loosing reception so what time should she call the kids that night.  

i told her anytime after 5:30

*BIG SHOCK* she never called last night!!!!

so, fast forward.....

craig just called me... she called HIM this morning and she made no mention of why she didn't call the kids last night. 

she told him her throat is killing her and her lymphnodes are swollen so she doesn't think she should have the kids this weekend. she actually had the nerve to say ""this doesn't ruine any special plans for YOU does it?!?!?""

ugh!  

btw.... she sounded TOTALLY fine yesterday and has been fine all week... we don't think she is sick...

he said he wanted sooo badly to say to her ""can we send the kids to you when we are sick?"" but we all know that would never happen. he is so pissed! he was soooo mad! he said to me ""you have been soooooo sick this week and have had no help at all.... and you STILL made this through with flying colors!""

she will never change... shame on me for thinking so...  

oh yeah, and you KNOW she was supposed to be giving us a check for her half of the medical this weekend too.... very convenient....


forget that minimum days for a week start TODAY... and i was hoping to re-charge this weekend to handle it :("

In Buddhism, there are Four Noble Truths: (1) Life is suffering. (2) All suffering is caused by ignorance of the nature of reality and the craving, attachment, and grasping that result from such ignorance. (3) Suffering can be ended by overcoming ignorance and attachment. (4) The path to the suppression of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path, which consists of right views, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right-mindedness, and right contemplation. These eight are usually divided into three categories that base the Buddhist faith: morality, wisdom, and samadhi, or concentration. In Buddhism, there is no hierarchy, nor caste system; the Buddha taught that one's spiritual worth is not based on birth.<br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Buddhism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='83' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>83%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>agnosticism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='83' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>83%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Islam</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='75' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>75%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Hinduism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='75' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>75%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>paganism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='58' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>58%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Satanism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='58' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>58%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>atheism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='50' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>50%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Judaism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='50' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>50%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Christianity</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='17' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>17%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=10907'>Which religion is the right one for you?

had a bunch of weird dreams last night... i think its all the neds. in one dream, erick and michelle lived next door to us and we lived in the house i lived in when i was in 5th and 6th grade. erick kept mooning the people who lived behind them. it was really bizarre. michelle looked all white trash too! it was so strange. there was a football team.... and jean and i rode on a train together.

""i think i have the black lung, pop..."" :) i just love zoolander! anyway....

it got worse on sunday night, i was starting to feel all achy and even used dustin's inhaler to help my breathing. 

so, i went to the dr. on monday and she thinks its my allergies and sinuses along with a viral infection. i had a fever on monday. i'm allergic to mold and dust, so i think that's what started it all in the garage. 

i'm better today but still not even close to 100% :( 

i need to figure out a way i can loose weight that i can actually DO! craig said that once i start feeling better, we will start to work out together every night when he gets home.

"event","so.... ya'll know how erin has now agreed to start paying half the kids medical like she has been supposed to be doing since july.... 

craig and i agreed that we would give her receipts and take it out of her alimony check on the 16th....

for february.... he just gave her the check for the whole amount and she said she would give us a check for her portion of the medical next time she saw us. YEAH RIGHT!!!! i was bummed, but it's ultimately craig's deal, so....

we see her next.... and she says she'll give it to him next time....

next time we see her, she says she RAN OUT OF CHECKS so it'll have to wait until the next time! 

OMG!! can you imagine if we tried that with her for her alimony check!?!?! WW# would insue! she couldn't bring cash? a cashiers check? no, that would be the responsible thing to do! ...and this is a pretty good amount of money, kids. i'm talking $170 is her portion for just one month. 

so..... i took dustin to the eye dr. yesterday.... $438!!!!! 

craig calls erin and tells her... she says she doesn't have that kind of money and will have to make payments to us!!! jesus! so, you bet its coming out of her check! 

other than that.... loved the spongebob movie! watched it with the kids the other night and i was DYING!!!! it's really good, and i'm not a big fan of the cartoon. 

looks like we'll be going to disneyland on easter :) anyone who wants to tag along is welcome! my aunt, cousin, and cousin's 4yr old son will be going with us... plus erick, michelle and 6 yr old cole (from arizona) will be going (i think) ... its going to be a blast! 

vicky's ""backwards"" birthday party is on saturday march 26th from 12-3... if any of you want to come, its going to be a lot of fun.... and i could use the help :) we're expecting about 15-20 kids! you WILL have to dress backwards :) 

i've been busy getting organized around here. i have been so busy, i have really let things go and its driving me insane! majorly focusing on label stuff and getting the kids stuff more organized."

"event","i'm just a mish mash of all sorts of crazy emotions this week. my parents wouldn't give us a loan for $2500, but gary coleman is giving us one for $2600!!! this combined with craig's parents calling out of the blue to tell us they will NOT cash our check for $200 to start re-paying them for the $1800 we borrowed from them for the corvette work until march 16th...... and for all the stuff that came out in therapy on monday when craig came with me.... i'm not sure how to feel about some things right now. 

richard (therapist) wants me to write a letter to my brother (but not send it) addressing my feelings for him for our relationship as kids. he thinks that this is where my insecurity issues stem from. i think he's right. 

i thought i came from these awesome parents who were so wonderful, but now that i am a parent and dealing with our kids' issues, i'm coming to realize that my parents were never emotionally there for me as a kid. they never did anything to my brother when they knew all the horrible things he would say and do to me.... so this made me feel like i couldn't go them when things got me down. 

this is why i now have such a hard time asking them for anything.... like money... because i'm afraid i will be disappointed by them again.... likei was with them not protecting me from shane as a child. 

all this is hitting me this week and i'm just trying to sort through it all. you all know how much i love my parents... and i still do.... i just know that coming to terms with this will help me to heal and move forward. 

i have my 6th kid logan here today :) took him and the kids to go see are we there yet. it was really good :) we laughed, we cried.... it was a good message and i think it was good for my kids to see.... 

craig and i are looking forward to the weekend. erin has the kids. i'll miss them, but i need to re-charge so bad.... we're all stir crazy from all the rain!!! i've been working so hard to keep the kids entertained. we had a card game tournament... watched movies, played video games, had hot chocolate, read, etc.... its been a fun 5 day weekend :)

i'm looking forward to a really fun weekend with the kids. we plan on watching movies and playing games. 

i think we are going to have our first annual monkey awards too.... need to get all that together :) 

i'm thinking about doing a backwards party for vicky's birthday. send invites in thank you notes, have the kids dress backwards, play pin the donkey on the tail and the furthest away wins, etc....

watcha think about that? 

james is going to his aunt karen's house for the weekend. he is so excited. stephen will be spending sunday night thru tuesday night with his mom for one on one timw. she swares to us that she will make this time for each kid. i sure hope so... you know i will be the one handling the fall out if she doesn't. we got really pissed at her because she keeps telling the kids about things without confirming with us first..... she's so good at this manipulation thing. 

good news is, we will be able to go to the j's party because she will have them that weekend now. she was scheduled to have them easter weekend, but its our year for holidays, so we switched weekends. yipee!!! :)"

"event","so, not sure if dustin has pink eye or not. byt the time i got him to the dr. at 2:30 yesterday, his eye was hardly red at all.... got a perscription for him, but the dr told me to only fill it if his eye gets worse. 

still no pink eye today ewither, so i sent him to school with some anthistamine drops in his eye. hopefully that'll do the trick :) 

erin called craig yesterday to bug him again about paying her cobra. she hasn't paid it , so she has no insurance. she applied for medical and medicaid and got turned down for both. i guiess her medical benefits do kick in at her job at 90 days, but for pre-existing conditions, you have to have been there for a year. it sounds weird to us... craig suggested she call the ins company herself to find out. she haddn't thought of that yet... *DUH*

she says because she will probably die *rolleyes* so she wants to see the kdis as much as possible.... yeah, that's why she couldn't even call her son back to wish him a happy birthday and only calls them once a week.... whatever... just more manipulation. if she really cared about her life, she would have gotten a better job with benefits months ago... like gone back to starbucks. 

it sucks to feel so jaded about the whole thing. its hard to have compassion after all she has put us all through. i feel bad about it, but its how i feel. she is sick... mentally sick...

i'm going to breakfast with nicole in a little bit. i'm excited about that! i miss her a lot since i don't work at carol kline anymore. jon changed the hours to 11-7 so he can get there later now. he is such a dork. good riddance!!!"

Thanks to Zora who so kindly kept up with me at my kan-chiong-self-pace.&nbsp;And so, I was first on the list for the interview. It was a One-on-Two presentation I&nbsp;didn't even know where to begin when I asked &quot;Can I&nbsp;start?&quot; So I&nbsp;went through all my works quite vaguely and stopping at some to show my already-made work.&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't even remember what I&nbsp;said. I&nbsp;only know it would be deemed as impolite to not ask questions when they asked so even though I already knew there wasn't internship, I&nbsp;still asked. Well, at least I&nbsp;got to know the exact details like how the course I'm applying has the most number of students in Lasalle that's about 400. Imagine competing in the industry? It's gona be madness.</div><div style=""text-align: center; "">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; "">Okay this was taken when we went Vivo but who cares.

In the first place, it was deemed impossible right from the start. The point where she started saying that level 3 will be very intensive plus we are poly graduates, we would expect of hope to get directly to the degree level, but we don't really understand the system of Lasalle. For the fact that every art institution is different, I&nbsp;understand. &nbsp;<br /><br />I guess they just want us to understand how they go about doing projects for one year, get used to it then go up to level 3 when the one year intensive specialization will be put to good use. Oh well, I'll just have to wait for the letter to come in 2 weeks and wait for UniSIM's interview first, to see which I&nbsp;prefer.&nbsp;<br /><br />There's always a dilemma with the certs involved. Like which is more recognised?&nbsp;Which has a better teaching system?&nbsp;Both has their unique qualities but it's ultimately up to me.

"event","Blogging used to be my escape root to all unhappy thoughts, it also used to be my source of happiness where I&nbsp;drop by to read all the happy moments, precious thoughts and lovely memories. But as the days pass, I&nbsp;don't know what to put down to words.&nbsp;

It's like words can't capture the moment, it can't relive the state you've been in, and it definitely cannot bring you back to the point of time. Undeniably, it lets you save and remember the time.&nbsp;

Sometimes having too much to pen down is a chore, you don't know where to begin where to end and probably that's how I'm feeling now. Just know that I had a great time with my family to Europe. Got a Gucci bag that's about $1.2k. Had a carefree worry-less life there. Everyone's slow paced, they don't believe in over-time work at all, working hours you see cafes filled with people drinking leisurely, you see tons of people in boutiques like LV.&nbsp;

Then when you're back in Singapore, bam!&nbsp;Everything starts on the spot. All your worries, stress, confusion are all back. What to do, where to go, what route should you take, go for this job or that, reply them or not?&nbsp;Do the design work or not, quotation of package rate?&nbsp;Then you start to wonder if this is really what you want to do. You are new you haven't tried the industry you don't know how things go and you have to keep asking around to get your own final answer. How tiring. Replying emails, discussing, on-hold projects.&nbsp;

Isn't that the life of Singaporeans?&nbsp;Non-stop, on-the-go, all for what?&nbsp;Money?&nbsp;"

"event","Amsterdam, is a smoker's dream: an amusement park of &quot;coffee houses&quot; that serve high-grade hash and pot under the tolerant watch of the government and legal authorities. 

Soft drug enthusiasts from around the world have made the pilgrimage to this Marijuana Mecca, from which they return with testimonials about some of the most potent weed they have ever encountered. 

&quot;The best high I ever had was the last night I was in Amsterdam last year, when I smoked a bag of Northern Lights and some other stuff I don't even remember buying, and finished it all off with a slice of space cake,&quot; said a smoker calling himself Lawnmower. &quot;And then I floated away to a land of many colors.&quot; 

Carl Lavin, an American who spent his winter holiday in Amsterdam, claimed that &quot;the average bag of weed was as good or better than anything I have ever gotten here [in the U.S.]&quot; &quot;The first bag was purchased at a reggae-themed coffee shop,&quot; he said. &quot;It was 9.07 EUR for a bag that lasted longer than our trip. It was called K2, and is simply the best weed I ever had.&quot; He said he fired up just before eating Christmas dinner, expecting a major case of the munchies. &quot;I never got hungry with this stuff,&quot; Lavin said. &quot;I didn't even finish my first plate. This stuff was that good. It didn't make me hungry or sleepy. Just high. Damn high. Rocky Mountain high!&quot;"

"event","Today, in quite a long time, I'm feeling the self emotional vibes. Of being so helpless just by my own body language and actions, I&nbsp;feel like I'm physically around but my soul is somewhere out there or it just died on me.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture5-82.png"" /><br /><br />Ever felt like someone's actions and words just don't tally? And slowly, you end up not putting any trust in him/her then you get into arguments and finally a break up. It's sad how people only see it from one point of view. So what if you feel that their actions and words don't tally, do you give them a chance to speak up and tell you from their perspective?&nbsp;Yes, no? <br /><br />I always feel that everything works both ways. In any case, both parties should have equal rights in speaking up and saying how they feel before it leads into a very abrupt ending.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture6-75.png"" /><br /><br />And then you have people who trust this sentence, &quot;Seeing is believing&quot;.&nbsp;I am one who believes in such a statement. But there are some who just believe in hear-say. Thing is, people are just so complex. Everyone says they want a simple life, that simplicity is bliss and look at what's happening to all of us? We are defeated by gossips and bitchings.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then again, of course when you don't see what you're meant to, it'll be that way forever, you'll be kept in the dark without knowing anything. And till the day you found that it's been going on for quite awhile, you break down, you turn all sour, you never want to believe in just &quot;seeing is believing&quot;, you never want to trust anyone anymore because you placed all your faith, hope and trust in that one person. And for that one person to break it in just a split second.... what makes you think it'll be so easy to pick it up again?&nbsp;<br /><br />It's easy to tear things/people apart, but it's difficult to pick up the pieces and fix them back together.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Well, nuff saying how i feel. Just felt rather hearty today, to the extent that I feel like tearing. Heartfelt moments from so many people this weekend up till today. Freddy boy, Mummy &amp;&nbsp;Miss Tan. And to think that I&nbsp;would be fine on my own doing things at my own risk. It's always the case that her messages never fail to make me feel so guilty and helpless, like I feel I've disappointed her time and again this semester. Well, I've learnt something from her today via sms &quot;as long as you learn from the process, we are here to guide and give you moral support. :)&nbsp;Smile&quot; It's these kinda messages that always leave me speechless, I&nbsp;have no idea how to reply, &amp; to begin with, I have no idea what to even say.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;"

"event","I&nbsp;hate it when all I do is blog about school and being stressed out, where's that sense of fun in my life anymore? Haha, but whatever today shall be the day I talk happy things. Today is the day I talk about how&nbsp;I haven't touched work at all for 2 days straight.&nbsp;<br /><br />And the last thing I wanna mention about is schoolwork, just have to do so ):&nbsp;<br />I'm left with.....<br /><br />1) Packaging Graphics<br />2) Brochure FC|BC &amp;&nbsp;make!&nbsp;<br />3) Cut A2 boards for A3 posters&nbsp;<br />4) Measurement for folder&nbsp;Make!<br />5) Brand story sheet?&nbsp;<br />6) Other banner designs<br />7)&nbsp;Super imposing everything!!!<br />8)&nbsp;Brand Guidelines<br />9)&nbsp;Specs&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh why, helloooooo Wednesday I will prepare to die.&nbsp;<br /><br />Back to - Saturday&nbsp;was baby's surprise birthday celebration and Sunday was dinner! Can you imagine how difficult it was to plan out everything?&nbsp;Luckily it went smoothly in the most impromptu way. For one, I'm a planner and when things happen and you have to think of solutions on the spot, I panic and have no idea what to do. So Saturday night was a killer.&nbsp;<br /><br />The plan we had in mind was kinda ruined by soccer match which of course Freddy boy will definitely catch when there's ManU around. So let's just keep it simple and say that he got damn pissed with me for making him go downstairs for his surprise. I mean yeah it's so stupid to force the birthday boy to go all the way down just to be wished by our condo boys at the clubhouse right?&nbsp;Felt so helpless seeing him so pissed, and in my heart I&nbsp;was like &quot;I'm innocent, I&nbsp;don't wanna make you angry but I have no choice. If you're not gona move your ass I'm just gona have to throw a bitch fit and act up some tantrums&quot; to a point where I&nbsp;really felt like crying 'cus I&nbsp;had no idea if he would be fine after that.&nbsp;<br /><br />But all was good when he saw a long line of people walking in with a birthday cake, say 23 over people?&nbsp;2am we cleared the clubhouse cus of the fucking guard with a fucking fucked up attitude. heh. Left for railmall to chillz and poker till 7.30am?&nbsp;By then of course most of them left.&nbsp;<br /><br />By the time I was home, tried doing work but I ended up half asleep to the extent where I&nbsp;wrote nonsense on my &quot;to-do list&quot;.&nbsp;<br />&quot;Cut A2 mounting boards +&nbsp;help to mouth damn long&quot;. after writing that, I was subconsciously thinking what is mouth damn long?&nbsp;Then I realised and I was like wtf. That woke me up haha!! Then... when i was trying to sleep, Mummy said she already made Cereal for meeeee, so I had to stay up smmre!!!&nbsp;Till like 10am?&nbsp;Haven't been eating well...&nbsp;<br /><br />Baby came over for awhile to play wii when we both woke up, then I&nbsp;changed and headed over to his place!&nbsp;Check out the birthday boy carrying and wearing his birthday gifts! haha, that's like full-body birthday present except the belt which I got from&nbsp;bangkok and his 'new' jeans that he bought from Lim Hao.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture21-31.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture20-32.png"" /><br />Haha Baby asked me to wear shoes. I so want and need a pair of vans soon!!!!<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture18-36.png"" /><br />Hello Tommy Hilfiger, I&nbsp;hope you like this wallet baby &lt;3<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture16-39.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture26-21.png"" /><br />Vroom vroooommmm to True Blue Peranakan for dinner, hoohoo first time I made a reservation!&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture25-23.png"" /><br />You know how fine dining we're supposed to sit opposite each other?&nbsp;B asked me to move over to his side since we had soooo much<br /> cushion space. haha &lt;3&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture17-40.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture22-28.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture27-18.png"" /><br />Hello Freddy boy why you so hawt why you so cuteeee why you so irritating when you're half asleep why do you always crack me up. &amp;&nbsp;I'm still so amazed that we're already together for 9 months. Okay it's short but it seems like time has passed by so fast. One minute I'm looking at images of us or those pictures that you'd commented on, it seriously felt like the photo was upload like a few weeks back but it could date back all the way till June 2009! Wow, wow wow. I'm so amazed by our relationship, so little quarrels so much space yet we're still going strong.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture19-33.png"" /><br />Haha I&nbsp;still find this photo damn funny and wow, I'm surprised you can multi-task!&nbsp;Ride bike and pose?&nbsp;hahaha. Smmre still can tell me &quot;eh b, try take photo while I'm riding.&quot;&nbsp;haha, I&nbsp;think I'll fly away anytime if we're on the highway!&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture23-25.png"" /><br />Decided to go back instead of heading anywhere else, and guess what?&nbsp;After like 3 glasses of white wine you became such a big fat pig!!!!!! Sleep sleep sleep. Everytime I'm with you I think you're asleep 90% of the time. Which is sad, I&nbsp;see you only at night, only when you end work.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the conclusion I came up with :&nbsp;No wonder married couples drift apart. It's work that pulls them away from each other. All the time they have is either off days or just seeing each other at night. Today's dinner was very pleasant. It's been ages since we've ever eaten at anywhere of higher grade. Today is one special day and night. And it's because I rarely see you in the afternoons or even head out with you that makes the night seem so perfect. <br /><br />We should do this more often baby, I am sooo gona movie-marathon with you once I'm done with school and when it's your off day! xoxo Happy 23rd Birthday once again!&nbsp;I&nbsp;love ya deep deep, much much many many.&nbsp;<br /><br />And wow, it's been a long long time since I've posted something so longgggg and all about le boyfriend. What love does to people sometimes. hmmmmm. <br />&nbsp;<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j22/meows38/Picture24-23.png"" /><br />Come I be your sexy art teacher or office lady. lol&nbsp;<br />"

"event","13 days and counting to the day when we'll all be free from extreme stress and lack of sleep. Important products haven't been done, haven't been conceptualised, haven't been sketched out. Each time I think of giving up, I start to think of the years I've gone through such hectic days, with more than 2 projects at hand so why can't I handle just one major project? 

13 days left cannot be compared to the amount of effort I've put in the past 2-3 years, that's prolly 730 days. I cannot let fatigue weigh me down, not one bit. I used to be able to go on for 48 hours without sleeping, I'm sure I can do it again but now, I'm struggling so bad. Why is it that headache has to always affect me? Wake up. Run. Do work. Just, do not sleep. 

Or maybe I should just sleep. ugh."

"event","my horoscope is getting more and more true each day, yeah getting scary. 


Today's emphasis is on decision making, Libra, but the decisions you make today are concerned with your future, not with what to have for dinner. Although you could be involved in meetings and discussions, you still focus on questions about whether or not you are doing what makes you happy. Sitting down and making up pro and con lists about your plans, would be a favorable thing to do, as would talking things over with a trustworthy, and possibly objective, friend. Don't waste time arguing over inconsequential things today; gossip and rumor should be ignored as well."

"event","And here we are again - my 6th yr in school and i'm nowhere closer to being who i wanted to be then when i started. Ok I exaggerate but I just thought things would be different. Oh how naive. 

Everytime I update it seems like I'm at a crossroads - I'm in need of a change, I want a vacation, yadda yadda same old shit. Only this time it's different because I'm out of chances - there's no more next year - if i don't graduate this year, i'll be out of luck, out of chances, out of time.

I'm back to thinking about enlisting again - in fact, i'm 90% sure that i'm gonna do it. My only issues are 1. my own fears and 2. my parents. (DUH) In order to make sense of the situation - for myself and for you as well - let's rehash the pertinent events of the last 5 years... 

2001 - graduated high school - decided to go to NU - i've always been curious about enlisting in the USAF because of my dad's previous service and decision not to talk about his experiences 

12/01 - 1st year at NU - intense desire to be more - talked to a USAF Reserve Recruiter, figured maybe it would be ok for mom and dad if i did it part time... NOT SO MUCH. mom freaked after i took the ASVAB and said ""wait until you have your degree"".

2001-2004 on the backburner while i struggled through semester after continuous semester of co-op and classes

2005-2006 what am i doing with my life? obviously i'm in no rush to join the working world and be tied to a desk/chained to a cubicle... isn't there something else i can do? i want to do more - be more... my mom actually said ""i should've let you join when you wanted to (in 2001)"" - ""you should've been a boy""... and dad (of all people i thought he'd understand) ""you should've enlisted when you were first interested"" - aka i'm old and apparently above all that because i'm about to graduate... oh the frustration.

I WAITED BECAUSE OF THEM.
I'M GETTING MY DEGREE FOR THEM.
EVERYTHING I DO IS FOR THEM.
I NEED TO DO THIS FOR ME.

Why do I want to enlist in the Air Force?

I realize I need to make some serious changes. I want to be more than I am, doing something that means something to someone. I want to be proud of myself instead of being ashamed of my failures. Serving will do that for me - my personal slate will be wiped clean and i'll be able to provide for myself and finally learn to be responsible for myself and for my actions, in everything i do. I won't be relying on my family - i won't be basing all of my decisions on what they want, what they expect. This is purely for me. My time to be selfish - to invest in myself and take the time to become my own person in an arena where i know i will be pushed and challenged and forced to be accountable and responsible and independent. Perhaps when i go home, my parents will be proud of me too, perhaps they'll finally believe in me, trust me, accept me as i am and not as they wish i would be."

"event","Not too much to write about- went to the doctor's this morning he just confirmed that i broke my pinky toe in 3 spots... i did a good job- the doctor said so! haha and he was kinda cute... hmmm.... haha anywho... that was that... then i went to the mall and got the 3rd book of the sisterhood of the travelling pants cuz i read the 2nd one yesterday... so i'm pathetic and am almost done with the one i just got today. 

i was driving home from work and doing my usual thing- scrolling through my phonebook and calling all my regular peeps and i realized that it's a friday night and nobody was around to take my call... or they lost their phone and i couldn't reach them... or it wasn't a good time to talk... or they just aren't as lonely and pathetic as i am. 

i feel like i'm in a cage and i'm waiting for someone to come break me out... but nobody can come.

why do all of the people i talk to the most live so far away?? or are leaving to go far away??

i'm sad and i miss melissa...

AGAIN. and i have finance at 8am... why do i do this to myself?! you'd figure i'd know by now NOT TO TAKE ANY 8 am classes! but whatever, i like to learn the hard way. i got my classes straightened out today and that makes me feel good. grades for summer 1 come out on wednesday and that makes me feel not so good. 

i got paid today and that made me happy, i also got my tuition bill today and that made me not so happy haha. 

i think there's a theme going on with this entry. for every good thing, there is a negative... 

anyways i'm still waiting to get my new phone, my mom thinks i'm so anxious about the mail cuz i want to steal my report card before she gets it (which isn't wrong, but i want my phone more than i don't want her to see my grades)- at least it'll teach me to actually do my homework. i suppose.  but anyways- since it's a school night and mom is gonna come down and yell at me... (you'd think i was in middle school instead of a SENIOR in college...) it's time to go to bed. though i'm wide awake and not so amped for classes tomorrow. 

wish me luck to get to class on time!

"event","I woke up this morning and felt guilty, sorry for myself and all sorts of yuck. It didn't help that i was woken up by my mom who was screaming ""we're having a yard sale"" and no we really aren't having a yard sale, she just brought down bags and bags of clothes from the attic and wanted us to sort through them all and figure out what we wanted to get rid of. Since my nephew cobie is only 5, he doesn't understand my mom the way i do so he gathered a few toys that he doesn't play with and said he wanted to sell them at the yard sale- it was too cute and we explained to him that grandma was just joking. 

And then i went to work- it was soo hot and humid, i felt gross every minute i was there. i ended up drinking 3 waters, 2 thai iced teas, 1 nestea and 1 thai iced coffee. I should cut down on the half and half but whatever- drink happy die happy haha... ""do you want some coffee with that cream?""

i was glad when melissa called before she got on the plane to singapore- glad to hear her voice but at the same time, sad that she was really leaving and going really far away for such a looong time. the distance between ma and il i can handle- cuz i know that i could hop on a plane and get myself out there if i needed to, but damn, between ma and singapore... well shit, that's just a little more complicated. but we're adjusting and doin what we gatta do. i'm faced with my reality of being here and now i just  gatta buckle down and get it done.  

at least i've got kt- we're gonna keep each other sane while melissa's gone and that's giving me more to look forward to. i've already prepared myself to get back into baggy lunch mode- eatin alone and takin naps in my car before going to work. haha i'm not that depressing... am i? it's not just cuz melissa's gone, i seriously have major mommy debt to pay back so she'll get off me and there's also things i want so bad to be able to afford like getting back on campus and spring break just to name a few. one way or another, i'll do my best to make it happen. it's do or die so i'm keepin a strict budget and doin what i can to keep mommy happy. 

i wish what i've done so far were enough. but my parents can't be proud of what they don't know. it's not like i run and tell them everytime i don't fuck up- maybe i should cuz then maybe they wouldn't be so disappointed when i occasionally do fuck up. arrrrgh. i can't wait for the day that i can wake up in the morning knowing that i'm my own boss and i can do whatever i want... 

well... a girl can dream..."

"event","so you know how i said that i was gonna come out of hibernation and start workin out again?- well i did and i was on a roll until wednesday... so my mom had this whole list of things for me to do and well, i'm a procrastinator so i decided i would work out, take a shower and eat lunch and THEN do everything my mom wanted. so i'm workin out- pounding out the push ups ya know how it goes, workin the free weights like they're nuthin... then my mom walks in and starts yellin cuz i'm not doing what she asked me to and i put my 12lb weight on my sister's bureau... 

and then it rolled off... i wouldn't have gone to the hospital if it weren't for the fact that it turned red... redder...purple and then black. thank goodness pam came home for lunch right then so i made her take the rest of the day off from work so she could take me to newton wellesley where we sat around eating doritos and pretzles for 4 hrs. just so the doctors could confirm what i already knew: my poor lil pinky toe is broken... they had to drill a hole in my nail to drain the blood underneath... that was fun to watch. 

...and now i can't drive... it's amazing the things you can't do without your pinky toe. i have a new found appreciation for my pinky toe and once my nail falls off and regrows, i think i'll treat it to a pedicure. 

anyways i still went to work cuz i need the $$ and honestly it doesn't hurt so bad- and my fun shoe thingy isn't as ugly as it could be, at least it's black and matches my converse sneaks hehe. 

oh and last night at work, i ended up bumping into my obgyn... apparently she comes to the 88 a lot... and orders food from my restaurant... hmmm i think i might have to quit now haha jk. she's a sweetie but she knows wayyyyy too much about all the ladies in my family- it's just weird. gross and weird...

annnd then my phone froze while i was in the middle of sending a text message (yes i'm a text message whore) and i had to call customer service and talked to this guy who must've thought i was an idiot who doesn't know how to operate a phone cuz he told me to turn on my phone which i did and i told him i got a white screen then he told me to make sure to hold down the power button to turn it on... DUH- if i didn't know how to turn on my phone, the screen would be black not white!! haha. so anyways i left it off last night whilst at the skellig with meg, amy and andrea for meg's 22nd birthday!... i'm such a one beer queer... but at least i slept good last night. and today i turned it on (hoping by some strange miracle it would work, and it did!) so i'm hoping it doesn't freeze again, but until i'm positive, i'm still gonna be using pam's phone... and mine. 

so today i have to continue cleaning out my closet... haha i'm sorry momma... i never meant to hurt youuuuuuuu haha wow i'm a dork.  and yeah... i think that's everything that's happened in the last 2 days. hehe... time to tackle bags and bags of clothes...

My mom actually let me sleep in today. It feeeels SOO GOOD haha but of course i kinda would've preferred to get rushed out of bed this morning since I kinda do have a lot to do today. 

I have to find the right time to talk to her about gettin my bum back on campus. I'm scared that she'll say no and I don't know if i can let it go just like that. When it comes to getting what i want, i'm pretty persistent. hehe.

i miss disney and i'm soo jealous of hayley for bein down there right now. we chatted for a bit this morning and the more we talked, the more i wanted to be there.

I spent 2 hours last night trying to explain to them why I want to drive out to Lee and spend the night in order to say goodbye to Melissa. 2 hours of going in circles... my mom said that i just don't give up and well what can i say, i am her daughter after all... so in the end, the force prevailed and i'm gonna be drivin out to say goodbye to a person who i feel like i've known my entire life. I know we'll keep in touch and all that but 6 months is a long time to be without someone you wouldn't mind spending all day with. 

I don't know what's ahead. I don't know what will happen in the next 6 months, but I know I can look forward to that first week in January when the chatch comes back. In some ways it feels like leaving disney all over again- you make friends and connect on all sorts of levels and then 6 months later you have to leave them. Only I know she's comin back and that makes it all more bearable. 

I just finished classes today and I start again on the 28th so- for a week at least, I am free. I still work everyday and all weekend but it keeps my mind off of all the confuzzling things that i don't want to think about. 

I'm excited cuz at some point I'll be spending time with the elusive Carla... ooooh. eeeeeh. aaaaaah. haha 

I hope your tonsils came out ok Meg!! 

and Kristen-I hope your birthday is as fun and exciting it can be (cuz we all know everything is more fun in FL).

As much as I care for Daniel- I feel like we're growing apart. It doesn't help that I've completely dumbfounded Alex and told him everything about how I felt when I was down in Disney. ""Sorry sucker- too late buddy!"" is pretty much what I said. Though I did throw in that I feel like Daniel is 90% of what I need and I feel like I might be missing 10% of something I don't know exists. What if... what if... I have to stop wondering that and focus on what I have today. I'm just confuzzled and letting things be what they are. 

""True friends are the people that are there for you unconditionally. They are the people that never question you and support you no matter what the circumstances are. They are the people worth living for."" -unknown 

My parents don't understand why I spend so much time with my friends. They don't understand what friends are- maybe because they don't have any... 

I've come to realize that no matter what... as long as I have my friends, I have all the family I need. 

We hold each other up when we need it- we're there no matter what and we laugh- we laugh until it hurts. And when it hurts its ok because our family is strong and our love is eternal and our bond is unbreakable."

School and work should not be excuses but they are my realities and honestly my days blur and half the time i'm not much fun to hang out with anyway. I'm sorry I didn't call more often and make time to hang out- I guess I assumed that we had more time.

I'm going to be 22 years old- why is it so hard for my parents to trust me? Why do I find myself acting more like an adult than my mother? Why does she think I'm a liar?! I feel like I can't talk to her. I can't say the things that I feel because I know I'll end up crying and then I'll get chastised for that too. I always try to keep my stuff together and not freak out about my issues because I know that my friends see me as someone they can come to about their issues but right now, it's all too much.

I'm fried. 

I'm a good kid- I'm not doing drugs or having babies or running away for ""love"". I know how important my family is to me and how much i need them but living in this household is wearing me thin. 

Maybe I need more discipline... maybe I need to enlist in the Air Force like I always wanted to so then when I come back, my mom's yelling won't phase me and her demands won't seem so ridiculous.

Maybe I just need to go to bed and sleep on this one... nothing will be solved tonight but what I do know is that as long as I have my family of friends, I have all the family I need."

The days blur, your muscles ache and no matter how well you sleep the night before- you just don't feel 100% charged. My batteries are running low and I'm counting the days til I go back to Disney. I feel soo out of the loop. I haven't been very proactive about keeping in touch with people lately- I just don't feel like I have any news to share. The same old junk doesn't make for good conversation. Though Meg and I had tons of fun at the Sox rally, it sucks that as soon as school starts and the summer is over, everyone goes back to their school friends and has no time or energy for much else. It's funny how we all dream about getting out of our respective home towns and then realize how much home is a part of who we are. There really is no place like home. And as much as I hate to admit it- I don't want to leave soo much any more. It'd be fun to travel and see the world- but no matter where you go- all roads lead home.

 Real Name: Daniel Star

Birthday: May 3 (He's the same age as Hello Kitty!)

Zodiac sign: Taurus

Birthplace: London, England

Hobby: photographing wildlife

Good at: dancing and playing the piano

Future dream: to be a famous photographer, or a celebrity

Favorite foods: cheesecake, yogurt

Family: Papa, Mama, and one younger brother

Trademark: a hairstyle that defies gravity (in other words, it sticks up...)

Personality: Daniel is moved by the smallest thing. He is very sentimental, and a bit naive. His fashion sense, though, is second to none: Daniel knows how to dress totally cool!

Daniel was Hello Kitty's childhood companion. As babies, they frolicked and played together. Daniel's father was posted to Africa, however, so the whole family departed. After living in several locations around the world, Daniel ended up in New York, and from there, he returned to England where he was reunited with Kitty. Thanks to his stint in New York and his natural sense of rhythm, Daniel is a pretty awesome hip-hop dancer."

"event","Man i hate this time of year, I can't stop sneezing! Soooo it's ms. andrea's b-day today!! yay! and at school my prof. let us out after only 40 mins of class! gatta love that! and it's a loong weekend though i have to go to a cousin's wedding on sunday (we don't ever see or correspond with that side of the family~ i don't see why I'm the one who has to go with my dad and represent!) why can't pam go?!!! she's the oldest... hehe. and it's almost set that daniel's coming (sans family) at the end of june... (he just actually has to get those days off from work and buy his tix ~ i'm sure the mouse can spare him). I have a java date with Dana so we can catch up and maybe even talk about american idol (even though we both say that we don't care about who wins since we're too old to be fans and would never admit to it). anywhooo soo far today is a good day even though there was a power outage and i didn't wake up til mega late and just barely caught my train... homework to do, then coffeeee though i don't think i need any more..."

"event","Stoopid me lost my phone yesterday... it's either riding back n forth on the orange line or hiding somewhere at school... it makes me sad cuz i really loved my pink phone with silvery glittery stars on it :( sooo now that means i gatta get a new one and i'm still broke soooooooooooooo grrrrr. Had a good convo with daniel yesterday... he's savin to come see me but his family wants to come too and i don't want him to have to spend too much money cuz he wants to stay for at least a week and that would be too expensive cuz of hotel costs.... we decided that since i know i'll be working in August (the original plan was the 4th-11th) and won't be able to spend more than 2 full days with him (since i'm the intern and shouldn't and probably wouldn't be allowed to take time off) that it might be better if he came after I finish finals at the end of june... and if his family came too at least he wouldn't have to pay for everything on his own and I'd be totally free for him ~with the exception of the b-day celebrations that week. the bad part is that we wouldn't have much alone time with his fam being there and all that but i guess it's fine just as long as i get to see him... nothing is set in stone and he was supposed to talk to his parents last night... i know it'll be hectic with kristen coming home and her and meg's 21st b-day celebrations but it's honestly the only free time i'll be able to have with him until after i finish my co-op at the end of december. i dunno... i dunno... things will work out one way or another and i need to stop worrying about it."

"event","I suck for not updating sooner. I've got lotsa junk goin on and no energy to do anything else. Anywho, enough of the excuses. Don't worry Kristen, things happen for a reason and we'll only be stronger in the end. I'm sure sucking out your gall bladder will go fine (you'll only have minor soreness due to the huge suction cup attached to your body~ just pray that they don't suck anything else out). Annnd YAY! I got my next co-op!! I'll be working at A&G in watertown as the media intern! I interviewed on Friday and they called me Monday! Phew! I was really stressin and bummin. Last night I had a major cry fest with Daniel~ he was upset cuz I haven't been too chatty the last few weeks and I was upset that I called him to tell him how excited I was about getting a job and he didn't answer his phone all day. I do have a lot going on and need to work on not letting outside factors affect my mood when I talk to him. It's all good now and we're both glad we got all that out. I'm psyched that I have a job and don't have to interview anymore. Talked to carla last night for a split second... she's stressed... wayyy to stressed... hopefully she'll make it through all this and I'll talk to her on friday. The posse is gettin together for andrea's b-day on thurs... YAY! ~ fun times as always~ and Kristen you dang well better not ditch on celebrating your b-day with me n carla for a DANCE COMPETITION?! grr we're in a fight. haha. whadda ya think about havin a girl's night for eats n drinks in boston?? we'll get all dolled up n take the city by storm... my finals end the 22nd so i'll be all yours til the 28th (my first day of work! yay!) anywhoooooo homework to do sooooo i promise i won't take soo long to update ever again!

"event","soo... I feel like shite. It's not like I don't want to talk to my friends, I really do. I just feel completely mentally exhausted right now and I can't listen to everyone else's problems because I can't even think about my own without wanting to crawl into a hole. Bethany wants to move to Orlando to be with Alex and she's doing exactly what I wish I could. Kenia is just crazy busy with work and I feel guilty for not calling her at least twice a day. I don't even talk to Daniel like I used to, he calls me at 11:30ish every night and usually by then I can't even keep my eyes open. Alex fractured his ankle, Veronica wants to enlist, Teresa finally told my parents about being preggo, I'm failing all my classes and don't know how to tell my parents, I haven't found a co-op job yet, my eyes are itchy, I have heat rash and the lack of privacy in this house makes me want to scream. I was looking forward to August because that's when I planned for Daniel to visit me I had it all planned out, he'd come the 4th, and the 5th we'd celebrate being together for a year, the 9th we'd go to a sox game and the 11th he'd go home. Now his parents are planning a trip and want to come at the end of July and leave Aug. 4th because school starts for them on the 5th. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I don't want to talk about it, I'd just rather go to a movie and forget everything for a couple of hours. But of course no one here wants to go to the movies........ fluck a duck I wish you were here Kristen. We could block everything out and forget all our shit together! ~ and on that note, my mom is screaming for the dishes to be done... duty calls!"

(well since i need to save my mooooola, I shouldn't have gotten it) ~ a perfect example of things that need to change... NO MORE BUYING UNNECCESSARY SHITE. BLAHHHHHHHHHHHH. I need things to motivate me, I need things to look forward to, I need I need I need........ maybe I should focus on what I have... I have great friends who make me laugh and smile... I have a love who's voice calms me and at least for a little while cures me of my worries and I have a family full of examples both good and bad that I must learn from. ok enough for now, time to meet with my advisor and put things in motion."

I went to work at 12 and expected to be outta there by 5-6ish... yah ""Hey Deb, can you stay til 8?""... I'm such a pushover.

Then Teresa gets all happy and says her friend will be in the area and he'll pick me up. soo i figga her friend will pick me up and i'll go home and sleeeeeeeeeeep after catching up on a few phone calls to people i've been neglecting (sorry guys i really do love you all!). but nooooooooo we go to a dinner party instead and whoa am i happy i went! haha we had fun... I spent the night makin fun of James (ex-show choir freak who now denies it all) and just talking much more than usual (which may be due to the beer and champagne i drank during and after dinner....) We were all depressed during the sox game and Marco (the host) told us about his girl troubles (he wants to settle down but he just can't find the right girl and when it rains it pours!)... despite that fact I think he's perfect for kristen... fyi girlie he's 25 a designer/architect (he designed Hal Gill's closet!) and 100% Italian... Avallone's the name, havin fun is his game. haha i know i'm corny. oh yea and he's a good lookin guy (not that I was lookin)Anywho... sux that you're in fraggin FL. Miss you much!

"event","I just want to say that I love all of you guys! No matter who's mad at who or whatever drama is going on, I will always cherish our friendships. Friends are the people who keep me smiling even when there's nothing to smile about. Friends make bad situations at least somewhat bearable. And friends keep my life filled with unexpected laughter and immeasurable amounts of joy. You guys are who give me my strength, and my desire to be more than I could ever imagine I'd be. All sappiness and tears aside, I honestly just wanted to make sure you all know that. No matter what happens tomorrow or in the years to come, I will always cherish these times and the memories we've shared."

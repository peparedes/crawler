"event","Please read the following article:

http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/03/02/catholic.town.ap/index.html



Then respond to these questions:

Having read The Lottery, Harrison Bergeron and Mister Magister, discuss your reaction to the article. Is it perfectly okay for a community to create a town with laws based on their religious beliefs? What if the town being built was an Aryan town? Is that the same thing? Is it okay for a town to outlaw items the US government says are allowed? What if the US government were to make these things against the law, would it be okay in *your* town to still do these activities? For example, right now, according to the US government, pornography is allowed if you are over 18. If the US government, tomorrow, said it was now against the law, would it be okay for you to go ahead and have it in your town anyhow?

Also, last thing to think about. Are laws just arbitrary?

I will check in on these posts and may make a posting or two myself!"

"event","Having watched the ""Twilight Zone"" episode ""Monsters on Maple Street"" in class, I'd like you to discuss how the modern telling of the story and The Lottery are similar. How are people presented? Considering what happened after hurricane Katrina, how realistic or unrealistic is it to think that, as a society, we are only 5 hours away from chaos?

How are Tess and Will alike? How are they different? In the final scene in the tv show, the children are standing and watching, how are children presented in the Lottery and how are they presented in the tv show?

Share your thoughts and ideas.

"event","Great job last week everyone! Having read Untie His Hand and Ain't I A Woman, I'd first like your reaction. What did you think of these two people? What does Douglas say about giving the negro the right to vote? Why wouldn't he be happy with just ending slavery? What 'community' does he belong to? If Douglas were alive today, what do you think he would say about programs like welfare and food stamps? What would Sojourner Truth say about equality between all people?

Okay, two postings... use the spell checker and we'll talk about this in class!"

"event","Welcome everyone! Please remember to write a paragraph reply to my question and this week's readings, then be sure to respond to at *least* one other person's posting. This assignment is due Tuesday, January 31st.

This week's question is this:

Having now read <u>A Horseman in the Sky</u>, the main character is confronted with a difficult decision - choose his military family or his blood family. What do you think about the choice he made? It is difficult to say what choice you would make in the same situation, as times and war are different now, but during the Civil War, can you understand the choice he made and why he made it? His father tells him ""do what you conceive to be your duty"", did he do that? 

Write a paragraph response to the story and answer the above questions... :) Be SURE to sign your name so I can give you credit for your responses and remember when you comment on someone else's ideas, the idea is to ask questions, NOT give a blanket agreement (yeah, I agree) or disagreement (I think you are wrong)... this is for a grade... blah blah blah

:)

ps... Oh, and while I am not looking for perfection in these comments... PLEASE capitalize your sentences and <b> <font size= 5><font color = red>USE THE SPELL CHECKER!!!!!!!!!!!</b></font size> </font color>"

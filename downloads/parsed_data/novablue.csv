"event","You know, every now and then we get these storm warnings. The newspaper write about them, radio warns against them, on TV it's all ""Lock up your pets and stay inside"" etc. And then... nothing. Nada. A bit of wind, at most.

and THEN on other days, it's windy like WOAH, no warning, no nothing... just all of a sudden, it's pretty much storming outside. So I'd like to take a minute and make a little statement:
""What the hell, swedish meterologists?!""

Woke up around 6 am today because it was WINDY outside, living on the 7th floor my windows take quite the hits during those moments so it kind of makes a lot of noise and I couldn't sleep well. Walked Dunder a bit past 7 am and it was fairly bad then too, though calming down. Right now, 8:37 am, it doesn't seem bad at all.

Laundry day today, ugh. Gonna wash my rugs and shiz... then hopefully vaccuum and clean the fish tank and all that FUN stuff. Oh, speaking of though - my fishies had another litter and I'm excited over one fry in particular because it's BLACK. I mean, several of them tiny ones have dark pigment coming in already so I expect they'll be dark but one is pretty much solid black! That's neat because generally they are a sort of greyish/transparent colour at first. So I hope the lil guy (gal?) will make it and I'm curious to see its colours.
There are three bigger fry as well, they now swim the the adults like nobody's business. Two have a bit of black coming in on their tailfins but that's all I can see, the third has black and yellow/greenish. Since only one of my guppies have had that, I'm assuming he/she is the fry of my big dominant female!
For the tiny ones I expect my black male may be the sire, though I wonder if I've had him for a month already (how long guppies are preggers)!

btw you know what's annoying? Being all into showing & breeding at FP but not having any dogs at the right age to do it, haha! I wanna focus on cavaliers and would even be up to buying a few puppies, but there's nothing good for sale. I bought a slightly older male for kicks to see how far I'll get him, we'll see. Maybe I'll browse and buy two really old dogs (like in their 70s) and raise a few levels for kicks.

Time to go take care of laundry now, so I shall finish this reply like so XD"

"event","Haha, so yesterday I checked my schedule. 
It showed me that today I had first a lecture from 10 am to noon, then seminary to 4 pm. K. Buddy asked if I wanted to go to <a href=""http://www.liseberg.com/en/home/Christmas-at-Liseberg/"">Liseberg</a> and exchange our xmas gifts etc. Which I did, of course.
Nowwww, that would mean that Dunder would be alone so much though :( From about 9 am to 5 pm, and then I'd only be home for an hour or so, and then most of the evening. Poor boy! So I was thinking of skipping the lecture (they're optional, technically) but what with it being examination time and all, I worried that it may be important, yeah? So I went up early enough this morning to check my schedule, double check and ponder and see what to do.
Was then I realized that I had read it wrong, the lecture was YESTERDAY. K, so in a way, this is good and bad:
Good: Drops 4 hrs from the time Dunder would need to be alone; now I'll leave at about 12 instead of 8. Definintely nicer.
Bad: Uh oh, I wonder what the lecture was all about, LOL!
Though today we're going to talk about the actual examination essay, so hopefully I'll be ok. I'll just ask my classmates what it was about... 

Tomorrow, I'm going to force myself (hopefully) to put together the rest of the essay. I've actually written 8 pages so far, and it should be 10-12 pages long. So two pages more and I should be good. I've written in all the basics, now it's all polishing and editing for the most part, though I need to add more literature - I actually don't have a single direct quote right now *cough*

So, new plan for today;
Uni 1 pm - 4 pm, on way home I need to stop by the local pet store and buy gifts for Buddy's dogs (gah why does she need so many? XD Haha, I think I may get like 2 things for them all to share, or I'll go broke! Or maybe just get something for the dali girls vs the whole gang, or maybe a small thing each + treats for them all or something, we'll see. Buddy only needs to get something for Dunder! haha). Then once home, have dinner and wrap 'em all up... Buddy gets off work at about 7:15 pm and we're going to meet in the city, outside Liseberg, so most likely I'll leave at roughly... 7 pm? around there, and be in the city at about 7:30 pm. Plan is to wander around for a few hrs, then go home, then sleep? XD And then back to the essay tomorrow...

well, I should get off my butt, Dunder says it's time to go outside now!"

"event","So...
Yesterday I made up for not giving Dunder long walks lately - and then some! Morning - the long walk around the neighborhood, Dunder got to wear his backpack too.
Spent most of the day judging my conf and a few other things.
Then around 3 pm I walked to meet dad, he was picking me up to go to the farm, I was invited for dinner. Usually they pick me up outside the apartment, but I can also cross the whole area and walk down through another neighborhood and then a short bit through the woods, and meet dad there. That road is shorter to drive buuuut the woods portion, you can't drive through there, so I need to walk those 30-or-so min to get there. I do it when the weather is nice and such but it's not really an option when it's dark or similar.
So Dunder got antoher walk, backpack again - not that I brought a lot to the farm but it was quite handy to let him carry everythign for once, LOL!

Once at the farm I snuggled with the dogs, of course. Viggo is kinda my boy and he was soooo happy to see me - started to whine and stuff when I petted him haha! He's so funny, and such a sweet boy. Elsa is in heat at the moment and in a ""I hate the world"" type of mood but she was happy to see me too, as was Tina of course. And then SAGA. OMG, can we say crazy puppy?! She's like ""OMFG YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND"" whenever someone (anyone, haha) greets her. And she's So. Damn. Cute! You can tell she's got more black coming in now, she's got like a dark stripe of heavier roaning on her upper body, it looks neat. Viggo likes her (except when she plays overly rough, which is most of the time) but Elsa doesn't care for her. They're pretty OK as long as Saga ignores her, f.ex. Saga sleeps in a crate, so when it's sleepy time they just close the crate door and Elsa can stand and glare at her in peace haha.

The cats have learnt to get along well too, they will follow each other around and play now, which is nice to see as Lakrits didn't like Findus at all at first. Haha, Findus is damn amusing. Once she jumped into the bath tub when mom was taking a bath. She stays mostly on the upper floor and had gone into the tub before - only then it was empty... needless to say she got quite the surprise when it was filled with water! She'sd done the same with the toilet too, actually, and twice at that - used to jumping onto it when the seat was down, but a couple of times it was up XD 

We had a traditional xmas dinner, may seem early but my parents have decided to stop having it at xmas instead, because it's a huge hassle to set up that sort of smorgasbord, a lot of it isn't the type of food lil kids love that much and so on... so now they just make a rather fancy dinner (compared to a normal one, at least!), one course that everyone likes you know? 
I also got lots of frozen foods, home made lasagna and some other stuff, from mom, yay! To bring to the apartment, I mean.

I also took Dunder for another 40 min or so walk while at the farm, so LOTS of walking for him yesterday! No complaints from him there...
Haha, when I was going home, I was standing waiting for dad, Dunder with his backpack. Both cats were out. Lakrits is curious about Dunder but keeps her distance. Now Findus just walked straight up to him, not the LEAST bit worried! Tail up and everything. Never seen a cat quite THAT unafraid of a strange dog, especially seeing how she's grown up with small dogs, never seen one as big as Dunder before! But yeah, she sniffed him all over and kinda just stayed near us. I held Dunder around his neck/front just in case he'd make a sudden movement - to be honest I don't think he knew what to do - he wasn't angry, but not wagging his tail either, as a matter of fact, he started to shake! I suppose he got excited... or nervous? Or terrified of the ickle cat? Who knows XD

We were supposed to meet in the base group at uni today and discuss our internships, but a classmate texted me last night and said several felt they'd rather stay at home and work, no disagreements there... so here we are monday morning and I'm at home, yay! And yes, procastrinating like no tomorrow but I HAVE written a bit on my exam essay too... On wednesday, we've a meeting or sorts at uni and we're going to discuss it some then, so we'll see what they say. My goal is to have the basic essay finnished before the end of the week, then next week I won't have so much time to work on it what with xmas and all, and I REALLY don't want to worry about it right then... and then towards beginning of january I want to look at it again, will be good to let it ""rest"" for a bit you know? It's to be done by jan 7th. Ugh, these reports are made of FAIL I can say that much..."

Want a code?
I have 4 left. If you want one, give a good reason why and you may get it, haha! The game is just starting out so there's not a lot to do yet, it looks promising though and you'll prolly get a nice low account number, too..."

"event","So here's the deal;
I'm laying in bed watching TV. Suddenly I hear a knock and go and open the door. 2 women from this place you call when you are hearing a disturbing noise from your neighbor is there and say the've gotten a complaint about me. They have thick jackets with ID cards and the whole shebang. I go O.O but immediately apologize, figuring it's my TV, and promise to turn down the volume at once.
As I do so (and they have left), I realize that this sort of thumping noise (like a bass sound you know?) goes on... I realize it couldn't possibly come from my own tv and turn it off completely, and sure enough, it goes on still. I leave my apartment and look on all floors to see if the women are still here, but they are gone already. So basically, I just took the blame for something I didn't do! The noise continues for a while. I call various numbers trying to get hold of someone who can help me out but basically just get sent on to the next person over and over until I'm told to contact the guy who's sort of responsible for my apartmen building. Downside being that he only has phone hours from 8 - 9 am... 
So, tomorrow morning I gotta call him. I know this probably is not a huge deal but it got me really worked up and worried. From what I understood they are going to write a report on this, so I'm guessing it's going to say that I bothered my neighbours! And I'm worried if this will affect my future chances to rent or like, put me one step closer to being kicked out (I don't believe I'll be kicked out, but like... first step on the road, you know?) I tried to explain this on the phone, and I wrote a letter to the company I rent from, though I bet it's not going to do much good. I really hope ""my guy"" can explain this tomorrow and hopefully like, believe my version, you know? I realize it's pretty much my word against theirs, especially since I did sort of ""take the blame"" when they knocked, but that was surprise and since I WAS watching TV I figured I must have had the volume on too high. They did ask if I had speakers on the floor or something which I thought was a bit odd (like ""it's THAT loud?!"") but I don't and well, like I said, the noise continued after I turned my TV off!

Gah, why did this have to come RIGHT NOW? I'm not going to be able to sleep well at all tonight, I'm just sitting here being all worried over this all :( Most annoying of all is that normally I don't watch tv after 9 pm (this was at 10 pm), I just did tonight because there was this super interesting show on! If I hadn't had my TV on, I could just have told them so and they could have found the real culprit *sigh*"

"event","...did I put the clicker O.o Seriously, why have I ALWAYS managed to hide it when I need it?!
But first thing's first.
I was supposed to arrive early at my internship today because they were going to a church. So naturally one of the buses was late, meaning then I missed the final bus, which only goes once every 30 min... I found anumber and called them and sait to go on without me, I'd be late, and then once there (at 9 pm - I was supposed to be there at about 8...) I had to run and find this damned church. I was there last year so I had an idea on where to go (thank goodness, otherwise I don't know what I'd done - I don't know the neighborhood well at all), and thank goodness another group from another preschool were late too, so the ceremony itself hadn't started. Apologizes to my mentor, she was OK with it at least... 

Had a half day today (always on the first wednesday of every month cause we've other stuff we need to do). Went home and called the vet regarding Dunder - as far as vaccinations go, she wasn't impressed with the last one being in 2005 and said we may have to ""start over"" with him ie next one will be given in a shorter period of time and stuff? I thought that was slightly odd considering that even that insurance company said up to every 4 years, but oh well. They also said there's a slight risk we can't vaccinate him today, depending on the meds and such for it ears, whatever happens there. I'm fine with that. Lmao - I also asked if they could empty his anal glands, only in my tired mind I suddenly couldn't remember the word for it! I was like ""and empty his anal... anal... you know?!"" - ""glands?"" - ""Yeah!"" XD Gawd I felt stupid then haha. Dunder does actually have a slight history with that. He's never had a real infection or something but we've had the vet empty them a couple of times, he's having such a period now, biting around the root of his tail etc, so I figured they may as well do it while we're there.

And the best part - she had an available appointment at 3:30 pm today! So I'm leaving in about an hour. And well, I want the clicker because at the vet especially but honestly also the area around it + the bus/tram is going to be MASSIVE training for Dunder. I fully expect him to act like an ass at the vet too, heh. Pulling, being worried and so on. I know this is a lot for him to handle. The clicker lets me give him his focal point and makes it easier for me to steer his behaviour... so naturally now I can't find it, ugh! I actually have two clickers - and both are equally lost... the most annoying is I remember thinking that the spot I left it in last time wasn't my usual one, but I don't remember what this new spot was... I'll just go ahead without one, I guess.

Speaking of vets and such, the smoney situation has been FAIL lately. I've just had SO many unexpected costs, like the fish tank, and the Wii (fine, I saw that one coming but I didn't know I'd get so many other costs afterwards!), naturally I just go my electric bill and a few others etc. So this vet costs is another addition on that... but obviously Dunder can't walk around with hurting ears. 

Because I've been kinda stressed and on the move all day, I can't remain calm now either. I don't have to go to the vet yet for a good while, but I'm like ready to go now anyway! I suppose part of that is because while I've been to that vet loads of times before, I've never gone there by bus/tram, so I don't feel I know 100 % how that portion will go, you know? I think I shall have something to eat (will have dinner when home tonight but I already sort of skipped lunch so I need to eat something... like I said, a bit stressed out so I'm not in a mood to eat) and then walk Dunder-man and then go. Oh, and brush his coat first. Can't go to the vet with an iffy looking coat now can we? XD

EDIT: Woot, I found A clicker! I didn't find THE clicker, I found my old crappy one XD and I just tested it and the sound is a bit different... but Dunder's worked with both, I think it'll work. This one lacks the sweet band around my wrist which makes the other one easier to work with but I'll live..."

"event","Trimmed Dunder this morning - funny what a huge difference it made! I even did a ""proper"" spaniel trim, ie I didn't trim his back smooth... normally I just shave down his upper body, easier to deal with. I should have pulled off the dead hair but I don't know where the trimming knife is... He looks fab anyway!
I also did laundry today and played Brawl... Lmao, so last night I decided to do All-star on ""Intense"" difficulty, which is the highest. I wanted to do it because you get one of the challenge rewards for it (the game has a bunch of challenges you can try to do). I had saved up lots of coins (you get them from winning fights etc) for extra continues etc so I was ready... Yeeeah it took forever, lmao. I think final time for all bosses ended at about 30 min - remember though that's for the times I WON a game - many stages I tried over and over and kept dying, so in total it's probably closer to an hour! And as you may remember if you read the last post, normally ALl-star takes 10-15 min on Easy difficulty. So yeah... And haha, afterwards you get a bit of music and screenshots and clips of the character you played as, and normally this voice says ""Congratulations!"" but when I beat it at Intense it said ""Wow, incredible!"" - Damn straight!!!
I only have 2 or 3 characters left at All-star now, then I'll FINALLY be done with that portion of the game, ugh! I still have Classic which is much the same thing, in that you beat stages... the fighting stages are easier actually but you get to handle this nasty boss at the end, I do NOT look forward to doing that at Intense setting...

Tomorrow we've a dog show! It's just a fun match, and we're just bringing Elsa. I'm actually nervous for once because Elsa, from what I've been told, does NOT like the table. So the story there... she used to be fine with it, I don't know why but she started to be a bit uncertain about it. Nothing happened that I know of, no incidents or falling off or anything. She has no problem dealing with people and no trouble climbing the furniture at home... Then mom and lil Sis took the dogs to a show because I couldn't be there that day, and Elsa for the first time freaked out on the table, did NOT like it at all. Maybe the rain and being with mom (who can't really handle a dog at a show) added to it. After that we took a pause showing her and I asked mom to keep training on keeping her on a table, according to mom she handles it just fine at home. It seems to be that combination of table + stranger + new place that she can't deal with. It's such a shame. I mean, if she was a large breed we wouldn't have to worry about it at all, but for a small dog, it can be devastating! Viggo's breeder have the same problem with a young dog they have. Gorgy dog, but freaks out on the table which ruins his whole gait etc because he gets so nervous. It's a big shame. So anyways, the other day Elsa was at the vet to get her vaccinations (1 year old now!). Mom told me she did NOT like the table there either. Plus she's been a bit freaked out by all the changes lately (Flizan gone, Saga has arrived etc) so quite frankly I don't expect her to even <i>behave</i> tomorrow... But at least I'm prepared for that?! It's good we're just bringing her too, I think, can focus on her then, would be trickier with Viggo, especially is she does feel uncertain and he catches on. So the plan is to basically go and try to make it a fun day for her, I'm hoping to ask the judge if they can be gentle with her on the table and maybe give her a treat etc... It's just a fun match, and a puppy show only for that matter so I hope they'll be understanding.
We've entered both cavs in the MyDog show in january, it's this big show. We want Elsa to have at least one official result, but it'll really suck if we can't get it, or she can't be properly judged, just because of that stupid table! Viggo I've no worries about, granted he can't stack worth anything (wish I could train him but it's hard to train a dog you don't live with!) but he enjoys it and he sure can gait when he's a mind to.

SO, wish us luck tomorrow, we'll need it!!!"

"event","So I've had a crazy week with lots to do, but you know what, I've finished it all! Or as well as I can, you know. SO WHEW life feels better haha. Still some things to worry about (like the next examination essay which ever creeps closer...) but I'm gonna try to relax this weekend. Internship begins on monday. Normally I live at the farm during that time but it won't work this time so I gotta travel from my apartment, which only takes 3 times as long (literally) *cough* At least it's just 2 weeks... And then examination, ugh!

Today I had a short day, just a seminary, then I cleaned the apartment (and did a good job too! So nice and clean!) and I bathed Dunder, which he didn't care for one bit (when I walked into the bathroom and called for him, he ran and hid in my bed lol!). Gonna try to try him tomorrow - I don't look forward to it one bit cause I'm gonna have hair ALL over my apartment when done but it seriously needs to be done...

Even though it's almost 11 pm I'm gonna play a bit of Super Smash Bros Brawl as soon as I'm done writing this. I've been working on finishing this thing called All-Star, basically you pick a character and beat all the other characters in the game, one by one or in small groups. It's like... 18 stages? 35 characters in total, takes 10-20 min usually depending on character, can take longer if you've chosen a harder setting too - I choose Easy just to plow through as quickly as possible. I've done maybe 20ish characters? I've not counted. More than half, but I've some left. Last time I played was as Ganondorf, he's made of fail because he's as fast as a drugged slug, ugh. Powerful attacks, though. At this point I'm not sure who my favourite is, according to the game stats I've played as Lucario the most, followed by Sonic X).
The reason I'm doing All Stars is that the game has a bunch of challenges, ranging from ""Unlock 50 songs"" to ""play as luigi three times"", ""finish target smash level 3 with 10 characters"" etc etc... and finishing all stars with all characters is one of them... I doubt I'll ever be able to finish them all because some are almost impossible but I've gotten fairly far now...

well, time to go play before it's waaaay too late!"

"event","So, after this morning's post *points down* life feels a bit better now that I'm home...
-Presentation went OK. Could have been better but it'll do. Teacher barely reflected over that she got our wok late, so I'm glad that we didn't get into more trouble for that.
-Mom's reserved Saga! She's an ickle roan cocker spaniel. So cute. But we need to drive roughly 283 km (about 3.5 hrs) tomorrow to pick her up... Me and mom are going. I'll be official puppy-holder in the car on the way home :P She's gonna be lil sis' dog. Mom told me her and the breeder chatted all morning nad it felt really right, the breeder and us kinda have the same view on things, you know? F.ex. she mentality test all her dogs, it's way harder to find that in a cocker breeder than it ought to be! And we DO have a problem with the temperament in the breed, so it's one of those things you truly wish more breeders worried about. But yeah, this breeder is all into that. After that chat mom also said to me she wants to mentality test Elsa next year. We've not been able to do it yet because the dog needs to be at least 1 year old and Elsa just turned that in october. And no point to do it in the middle of winter. Plus I wanna have Dunder done too for kicks and cause I think it'd be so interesting to see his reactions, so if we're lucky maybe we can get a chance to do 'em both this spring. Viggo already had it done as you know... I told mom maybe she should do it with Elsa, because she's very much mommy's dog and maybe if I keep her off leash she'll just run back to mom LOL. But I can handle her too if needed.

So even though I'm technically in the middle of semester, I've told myself I'm going to just relax and take it easy tonight, play the Wii and just enjoy life, you know? I think I need that because this week has just been so insane.

The fish are doing well btw. I actually removed one of them from the tank, one of my older females because she wasn't looking hot at all. I suppose the stress and well, everything that happened to her didn't work out too well. She had begun to grow a white spot and I feared it may be a disease and I really didn't want it spread to the others... Plus between her torn fins and being quite lethargic in general I thought it'd be best to get rid of her. I do miss the lil girl, she was pretty, blue/black spotted. The other girls are all doing fantastic though, large healthy fins and active and curious. I discussed guppies at the store yesterday when we bought the tank with one of the workers and we discussed how fun they are, they are so active and full of personality, you know? Curious about what goes on around them etc. Haha, sometimes when I sit and watch tv (tank's next to the bed) I'll glance to the side and the whole gang is staying as near me as possible!
I know it was a no-no but I actually bought 2 new males yesterday night... in my defense they are doing wonderfully. They are so pretty. I can't get good photos but they look much like this:
http://www.classycastle.com/guppies/better-blueboyyellowgirl.JPG (left one - not quite as large fins and a darker hue of blue, though)
http://zoology.okstate.edu/zoo_lrc/biol1114/study_guides/labs/lab14/guppies.jpg - See the one about in the middle, a bit to the right, that's mostly black with a white head? Much like that, only some blueish stripes on the front/middle as well. Very pretty!
Right now they are trying to convince the ladies that they should ""get to know each other"" so they seem content enough in their new home!"

"event","Yeah this week has been kind of crazy, honestly I'm all out of energy and everything just feels like crap right now. Though I think it'll feel better tonight...
So;
1) - Flizan put to sleep on monday
2) - Work with classmate where I (again) do 99 % of the work
3) - My fish tank gets a crack, water all over the floor, so I'm worried about mould etc in the floors
4) - Spend lots of money getting a new tank
5) - This morning when I am to turn on the computer, it won't start... I just get an error message... I very nearly freaked out, what with the schoolwork and all, called dad frantically at not even 7 am to ask what to do... eventually I got it fixed - the UBS memory was still plugged in, and the computer wouldn't start (like with old floppy discs, you know?). So it worked fine after that but I was still really shaken!
6) - Mini-examination today and I fear we screwed up regarding whom to send our work, so I don't know if the right teacher got it, or if I'll get chewed out, or we'll pass or not or what. I KNOW it's not the end of the world, but you know how that sort of thing can still make you worry? Especially with everything else going on, I'm NOT liking this. Add, just for kicks, that my classmate may or may not even go to uni today, as her daughter was getting kinda sick yesterday.

So, I'm feeling just... shaken, nervous and like nothing is going according to plan lately!
Tomorrow I study from home, thank goodness, just stay home and read (though I've not got all literature - next problem!).

The light right now is that my parents are talking about getting a cocker puppy. The breed is a pain in the ass 70 % of the time but the rest they are such fantastic dogs we just can't live without one. We've found a super nice kennel that have a bitch puppy available, and the crazy thing is, it's the exact colour, and even is nicknamed the name my sister had in mind when she described what she wanted! Like, the perfect match! The downside is the kennel is located across the country, but the breeder is going to a show (tomorrow, mom thinks) and if so we could meet almost half way (well, not quite, but better than visiting her in person, talking distance). If so, I'd like going with mom tomorrow to see the puppy. So right now I'm trying to think ""happy cocker thoughts"" lol. I'm SO glad we've only class for a few hours today, gah I need to go home and just rest from all the drama this week..."

"event","Last night Buddy came over after work (about 7:30 pm) and we had dinner (lasagna with garlic bread mmm) and played the Wii. It was lots of fun! It took a while for us to manage to synchronize the remotes, though - at first Buddy did it the way she thought one should do it, end result being that neither remote worked! But we found the manual and figured it out, heh. We only had time to play for about an hour and a half or so but it was a lot of fun. 

Just got off the cell talking to mom - she's made a vet appointment for Flizan on monday. As I'm sure you know she has some <i>massive</i> fear aggression to the point we can't groom her. Like, last time she was trimmed (maybe a year ago) dad helped out, and even now dad can't hold her without her panicking. And I mean, it's not like they were all violent and mean to her - we're talking cuddling and reassuring. If I try to hold her against her will, she'll scream, snap wildly and wet herself. She's really extreme, and while she's better than she used to be, any situation that requires her to be held still, or touched (beyond a simple petting) will have her freak out. So, on monday she's going to the vet, filled up with drugs until she's sleeping and then they'll trim her, clean her ears, clip her claws and all that. It's just the kindest thing to do for her - as little stress as possible. The vet said there's are meds that could help her calm down, which we are going to try, though they also said for a dog that's so extreme they may not help much. But like I said, my parents want to at least try it. Just this vet visit will cost $250... They're not sure how often they can take Flizan to have this done, it's a lot of money, and there's always a slight risk involved with anesthesia... I mean I trimmed Nellie every 2 months, not an option with Flizan. But like the vet said, maybe if we get her completely shaven down now, and the meds... maybe it'll make it easier next time. We'll see.

Day off today! Or well, study from home, but whatever, heh. I started the morning by walking 'round the whole neighborhood with Dunder. I've been pretty good at doing that, I've done it almost every day or a week or so? At this point it doesn't even feel like that long a walk, especially since I try to keep a good pace. I think I walk it in about 25 min atm. Took over 40 min when I started out - partly because I had to work so much with Dunder's leash training though, made it take longer!
Speaking of - both last times Dunder met another dog during a walk, he behaved So WELL. Like, yesterday we met an older woman with a phalene and a small crossbreed. The phalene was barking, both were pulling on the lead etc. Dunder walked past them on a loose lead, heeling, perfect eye contact with me!
Today - repeated the above situation, only a golden retriever. Not aggressive but interested and dominant body language. Dunder looked at it, then right as we passed it (and it was less than 2 meters off, more like 1 meter, at most!) he turned his gaze up to stare at me, perfect eye contact on a loose leash as we passed it! SUCH a good boy. Thank the heavens for the clickers, it's the perfect training tool for Dunder, he has responded so well to training with it. Not that he's perfect all the time, but compare with how we were doing a year ago and the difference is there for sure! I remember when I was almost afraid of passing another dog, now I tend to almsot look forward to it to get the chance to continue working with Dunder's behaviour. He has his moments where he ignores me, but those keep becoming rarer."

"event","Haha, yesterday was a bit crazy for sure!
I didn't write this here yet, but on friday I bought a Wii! I had been debating to perhaps buy one after christmas or so, and had looked at PriceRunner (a site that compares prices for different items all over the country) and such, but no definite plans. Then on friday when I went grocery shopping, the store (which has had a huge remodel done) offered Wiis - at a lower price than even the lowest PriceRunner had! So after a bit of debating with myself I bought one. I didn't think the <a href=""http://www.forgettherest.com/Media/images/Games/NIN89003.jpg"">nunchuck</a> was was included, so I bought an extra one. I debated buying an extra remote but they are PRICEY. Plus I figured, bot my fam and Buddy own Wiis, so if someone comes over, they can bring a remote you know? I also pondered whether I should by a game or just wait until <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx8QFKj421A"">Sonic Unleashed</a> is released and buy that, but I figured I could ask for Unleashed as a b-day gift, and the game that is always included with the Wii - Wii Sports - gets old lol. So I bought Super smash bros Brawl! Neither my family nor Buddy has it either, I figured the games they own, I can borrow if I want to play them.

So, brought everything home and plugged it in... and it wouldn't work! I even had dad come over after work to look at it, since he's more ""technical"" than I am, though I was fairly sure I'd done it right, cause I've plugged in Wiis before. But he couldn't figure it out either. He brought it home to the fam, to try it with their TV, just to make sure it wasn't an issue with the console itself. But it worked fine there. Lol - all afternoon I had a Wii, and all I could do was friggin stare at it because my TV (or so we presume) is so old/stupid it didn't know what to do with it! My grandparents had been debating changing TV and had said I could get their own, or I figured maybe my parents had an old one I could borrow.

Yesterday (saturday) I met Jake. I met him in the centre and we took the bus home to me - first time he saw my apartment. I made him coffee (and he didn't throw up or anything so I assume it tasted OK XD) and I had tea and we chatted and such... Dunder behaved pretty well. He did beg a bit while Jake ate - he doesn't paw at you or make noise but he'll sit and stare at you with a VERY expectant look lol. But Jake seemed to really like him. Then we took a walk around the neighborhood, and he went back to his place.
I saw I had a missed call from dad, so I called him back and he said he'd come over to look at the Wii/TV again. That did make me slightly surprised because he sounded surprisingly happy about it you know? He said he'd take about 20 min (though it took more like 40 haha).
I sat by my little table and read and kept an eye out for them. Dad told me later that they had seen that I was ""spying on them"" as they said!
So, what they REALLY did was that they drove to another parking lot, rather than the usual one, and entered from the other side of the building, so I didn't see them. Then dad drove back and parked where he usually puts the car, which I saw then of course. I saw him approach the building and thought it was strange that he didn't have anything in his hands, not even the Wii. I figured either he forgot it or he wanted to help me carry or something.
When he rang the doorbell I opened, he said Hi and then opened the elevator door again - I figured he'd put an old TV/the Wii there or something, but then he went on like ""Oh, well are you there! Hi!"" and mom steps out... and together they have this HUGE box... At first my brain doesn't quite comprehend it, so I don't say much, but it's a brand new TV... a brand new, flat screen, 37"" tv.... and it's MINE.

To sum it all up, they felt so sorry for me, having spent all my money on a Wii and then not being able to actually use it due to a tv made of fail. So they figured that santa could come early this year... And fully understandable, I won't get more gifts round xmas and smaller ones for my next birthday and so on... ""no more gifts until you're 43!"" as mom put it... but wow... I've NEVER owned such a nice tv, I actually have never owned a brand new tv, ever, I've always had ""hand me downs"" hahaha. It's absolutely gorgeous < 3333  And it has a remote, and I can now keep my dvd player, boxer (for the tv channels) and wii plugged in at once - no need to switch cables and and forth like the old tv! And obviously much nicer picture (which is MUCH bigger) and sound and so on... so happy!!!

So needless to say I played all afternoon. Brawl is funnnnn. I played the old super smash bros on the 'cube so I was familiar with it, though of course using the controls in a new fashion takes some getting used to. Speaking of - a nunchuck WAS included, haha. So now I have 2 nunchucks but only 1 remote XD But I want a 2nd remote eventually and then I'll need a nunchuck for it anyway so it's all good.
I played this adventure setting last night. funnn. You win characters and play stages and such - it's more or less a classic adventure game. It was, erm, interesting to see <a href=""http://www.wikicheats.com/images/8/83/Lucario_Screenshot.jpg"">Lucario</a><a href=""http://www.wikicheats.com/images/8/8c/Smash_Bros_Brawl_Mr_Game_and_Watch.jpg"">, Mr Game and Watch</a> and <a href=""http://gaygamer.net/images/ssbb_snake.jpg"">Snake</a> in a scene together LOL! Normally slightly different settings for those...
I told myself I'd play until I got Sonic added to my team. I had no idea when he'd appear. Cause you know, he's my fave video game character EVAR and I really wanted to try playing as him.. Well typicall he's the last extra character to appear, riiiight before the final boss LOL! I'd get that clip from the game but I can't find it... <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1l7X2F3lbw"">Here's his ""intro""</a> for Brawl though, that they used in commercials etc... Hehe that music brings back memories, it plays during one of the games' final boss stages... 
I did find this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zOQq2N3xA
lmfao < 3
Anyways so I finished the adventure setting... I think... kinda?! Cause I finished the final boss but it says I finished 80 % so I must have some left but I've no idea what, haha. Maybe hidden things during stages or something, I dunno. I think I finished all stages anyway. 
My favourite characters to play as so far (well, besides <a href=""http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/sonic.html"">Sonic</a>):
-<a href=""http://smashbros.planets.gamespy.com/ssbb/images/metaknight.jpg"">Meta Knight</a> - very agile (flies high), speedy and nice attacks
-<a href=""http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/pit.html"">Pit</a> - will someone explains how such an awesome-looking character has such a terrible name?! Like MK he flies fairly high and has some nice attacks with that knife thing of his
-<a href=""http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/pokemon_trainer.html"">Pokemon trainer</a> *giggle*
-<a href=""http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/pikachu.html"">Pikachu</a> - Was my fave char in the old smash bros so I know how to handle him pretty well
lol I play as many others too but I normally have those on team, or at least a couple of them, when I choose a set of 4 characters

So my main problem today is that there's so MANY things to do, gah!
-Play Brawl
-I got 3 tag commishes, so I want to finish those asap to get em done
-<a href=""http://woolly-hooves.com/"">WHILS</a> opened today! Well, for us who bought an early account, which I did XD it's a funnnnn game. I can really recommend it when it opens.

Gah, I've not even had breakfast yet, haha. My plan now is to eat, draw, then go play Brawl O.o I played some Whils already."

"event","So what's been up...
Well, we decided to wait with Tina for a bit longer. It's hard though, she keeps getting worse you know? But she still has good and bad days.
In other news! lol. 
Spent the weekend at my parents' - met Findus! She's sooooo cute! She looks like a miniature adult cat! For those who don't visit the PKC, a picture:
<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v383/Novablue/?action=view&current=findus.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v383/Novablue/findus.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
I also took Dunder to the woods and let him run around and got some photos. You can find em at my <img src=""http://novablue.deviantat.com"" title=""""  alt=""DeviantArt"">, or a few of them at least.

New class began this monday! It seems fairly interesting but fast-paced... like, lots to do right away you know? We copied books and stuff yesterday, plus I was at uni all day so I was about dead when I finally got home really late... Watched TV, had dinner, took a bath... had hoped to watch Simpsons and prepared with lit candles and all, but then they had friggin soccer, gah! So I read a bit then went to bed...

...Woke up at 5:30 am this morning to see how the president election went! Happy with the results, too. I thought he might win but I know you can never know for sure.
Today I've studied from home - did lots of reading this morning, then I cleaned up a bit in the apartment, was going to take out the garbage, but as I went to get stamps and shop a bit, naturally I forgot the bag... to come home and find that Dunder had opened it, and spread it ALL over the floor... my just-this-morningvaccuumed floors *dies* YEah I wasn't happy about that.
More studying, had lunch... then I went on to do more fun things, like hexing, hehe.

I feel really tired, and have all week. I don't know if it's because there's been so much information to take in at uni, or if I'm getting sick (I've felt kind of odd) or if it's something else. I go to bed early but I also wake up early, like this morning, and I got up the same time yesterday. So maybe I'm getting up a bit too early. But that's when I naturally wake up! gah lol.

Tomorrow we've a long but free day at uni, gonna work with a project for monday/friday, then on friday we've a lecture and are going to discuss these Qs we're to work with tomorrow. Then weekend, which I need x many right now!
Jake is coming over on saturday. He's never been to my apartment before and want to see it. It'll be interesting to see how Dunder reacts! I think I might bring him to the centre (where I'm meeting Jake) because it may be easier for Dunder that way, since they'll meet outdoors and so on? It has nothing with Dunder being aggressive or anything like that - rather the fact that he gets SO excited when I've visitors over, and won't calm down, it's like he's in constant greeting mood, you know? It's tiring for him and can get a bit bothersome for the guest in question, since Dunder won't leave them alone but rather will follow them around, greeting them whenever they reach down or anything like that. We'll see. Right now he's splayed out in the bed sleeping in the sun that reaches in through the window.

EDIT: Oh, and now I suddenly kinda remembered what I wanted to type about LOL!
1) FCI will no longer require working titles for an international show championship for any breed. I was worried this would go for ALL champions but from it won't affect the national championships. I hope the SKK won't drop them for our ""regular"" champions.
2) The Swedish kennel club have updated some of their rules. I doubt anyone but me cares but it's my blog so I'll list the changes anyway :P
- While a rule was, naturally, that you mustn't mistreat your dogs, it's been changed to ""dogs or other animals"". So if you, for insance, mistreat your cat, it's considered breaking the Swedish kennel club's rules (if you're a member)
-To not be rude/diss other specific members. Of course you can't control what people say, but this is about pointing out and completely dissing another kennel club member publically and openly, like on a website. The kennel club are however aware of the difficulty between free speech and openly dissing someone
-To not do something in order to affect the results/judging of a dog, not speak ill of other dogs, members of workers - before the rules were read as on meaning on the day/place of the trial only. Now it will also apply before/after the trial.
-Not register puppies in another's name, not use others as middle man sellers or act like a middle man seller or buy such a dog - before the rule affected ""breeders"". Now it affects ""every member"".

-The portion regarding ethical breeding has a new introduction and some rephrasing (there's lots more, of course - just quoting new additions, or updated phrasing)
""Dog breeding should be done in a way that benefits the offsprings' health and wellbeing""
""Only use dogs for breeding that do not have a serious disease, disability and have a good, for the breed typical, temperament""
""When brreeding avoid combinations that heighten the risk for serious disease or disability in the ofsfspring""
""As an owner follow SKK's health program. For breeds that require veterinary/genetic proof and/or passed mentality testing should have proof of such available before the breeding takes place""
""To not use dog for breeding that has proven through DNA-testing to carry double genes for a serious disease that is inherited reccessively. Dog that is shown to be a carrier of a single gene for serious disease that is inherited in a recessive manner can be bred but only when combined with dogs that are not carriers and providing this agrees with the breed's health program""
""To follow the rules of the country where artifical insemination is performed, but never by anyone but a certified vet. In Sweden the vet needs a permit from Jordbruksverket to be allowed to perform inseminations""

-More under breeder's ethics:
""To not use dam/stud for breeding until age where the dog is physically and mentally grown""
""Not breed a bitch at too high a age, which is dependant on breed""
""Not let bitch give birth to more than five litters. If a bitch has two litters within 12 months she must then be given at least 12 months of rest before next litter. Bitch over 7 years old must rest at least 12 months between each litter""
""A breeder should make sure that each puppy before being sold has an enivornment that stimulates the physical and mental development and a good socialization with both man and dog""

sounds good to me :)"

"event","Sooo I got 3 guppy fry (and I LUFFS THEM) - only 3 cause I couldn't catch anymore and I think the rest were eaten... they are in a floating breeder tank, much like this one:
http://www.petmart.co.nz/cart_product6966-1-2312.html?Title=AQUA%20ONE%20GUPPY%20BREEDER%20TANK
minus the lid and suction cups. It just floats around in the tank. The fry seem happy enough and the adults can't eat them. Problem has been though that the pump makes the tank go to the side of the tank and bump into the wall, occasionally. Very annoying when you're trying to sleep because that's the end closest to the bed... so last night I got up and changed the pump strength and direction so now it doesn't bother me. Haha - that was the oops moment, this morning, I was gonna feed my gang, and when I had released the food, I realized I had dropped it ALL into the breeder tank. Heh, oops. Fished up what I could... at least the fry won't need to go hungry now?!
For readers who have never had guppy fry, they are tinnnyyyyy. And adorable XD Big eyes. About 6 mm long when born... I hope they'll grow fast so I can release them with the adults - I have one female that looks like she's getting ready go give birth, but I don't want to put her in with the frey - she'd eat them! 
I dunno if I've shown my guppies off here, I don't think so. I have 5. Had 6 originally, one male disappeared during my internship. I think the others ate him... never saw a trace of him, and there is a lid so he couldn't have gotten out of the tank. The others are doing well though. I'm sure an expert could tell me a hundred things I'm doing completely wrong with my tank, but they all seem alert, colourful and curious, no torn fins (beyond what they had when I got them) or anything like that.

I haven't been able to get photos of my fish, but here are ones that look like them:
My male looks a lot like <a href=""http://msnbcmedia1.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Photos/051229/051229_guppy_hmed_3p.hmedium.jpg"">this one</a>. I wonder if he's the father of this litter of if the other one got the chance to breed! The other one was yellow/black striped.
I have one female <a href=""http://keysboroughaquarium.com.au/2008/images/guppy_female.jpg"">like this</a> though her blue spot is noticably larger and she has a few black spots also on her tailfin. She's a real stunner, very shining colours! I also have a female somewhat like <a href=""http://i136.photobucket.com/albums/q179/forguppies/NeonBlueRibbonFemale-1.jpg"">this</a>. Then I have a female like <a href=""http://animal-world.com/encyclo/fresh/livebearers/images/fe_guppy_s.jpg"">this</a> but with more noticable black spots. And finally, my pride and joy, a BIG female like <a href=""http://image.bizrate.com/resize?sq=160&uid=559389705&mid=121361"">this</a> but with bright green rather than yellowish. She seems to be the leader of the gang, or just in really nice condition - big, healthy fins without a single rip in them. She's the one that's preggers again - she had a first litter but that was while I was away and they were all eaten *sniff* Let's hope this litter does better! Again super excited to see their colours, I dunno who their parents are, but I think it was one of the blue gals, possibly the solid blue one. One has a few black spots coming in on the tailfins but the others are transparent so far..."

"event","Sent in the examination essay to this special email today (basically it will go through a process of being compared against others' work to make sure it's not stolen etc). The odd thing is I've not gotten a reply that it got there OK... Will wait until tonight, if no reply by then I'll try again tomorrow.

This morning I was going to check and make sure I didn't have any bills waiting. I get 99 % of them online. Logging in at my bank, it told me it was time to upgrade/update my license thing. No biggie, did that... and then couldn't log in. Tried and well, no ciggie. I ended up phoning internet support, and we got it figured out. Most likely the site cried because I upgraded and the system didn't catch up at first or something. After I closed the program twice and then tried again, it worked. You know it was nice to just be able to grab the phone and call a stranger with no worries. I mean, I used to HATE making phone calls, even to friends. I still will rather pick email than a phone given the choice, but yeah, I don't hate it like I used to. Mostly because no one will make calls for me now lol.

Today during Dunder's lunch walk I heard a scream, naturally miss Chihuahua (the neighbor's dog) came running up at DUnder once more... someone had forgotten to close the door to where you go into the building itself or something like that. She ran straight up to Dunder who was just finishing peeing, and she was actually nipping (over and over!) after his hindquarters! Dunder amazingly took it in stride, I pulled him towards me on the leash, he walked to me without even looking stiff or barely looking back at her! Owner came running and got her. I did get my heart beating though. Imagine if one day he gets enough and I can't pull him away in time.

Speaking of dogs there was a horrible accident in Gothenburg last night. A woman in her 40s was getting off the tram with her mixie, and the leash got caught in the tram, which drove off. The woman ran after it for 2 stops (1-2 km) before it was topped and the dog released. At that point, the woman completely broke down. The dog was badly wounded and even though an ambulance and rescue workers did their best, the dog's life couldn't be saved. Imagine seeing your dog pulled to death, stuck to a tram, right in front of you but unable to help it...

Today I've been lazing around for the most part. I'm kinda tired today. Been doing some hexing and dumdumdum drawing with watercolours. I need to get into that loop again! I enjoy it but I have no patience so I tend to rush and ruin it... been working on a cavalier head. We'll see how that goes haha.
Later today we're going to do loose jumping with the shetlands. It's tiring like crazy cause you run like a mad thing on crack to keep up (especially towards the end when the judge wants to see 'em trot!) but it's fun. Last time I had Pontus and I'd like to this time also though it doesn't really matter. We're hoping dad will film it all. Last time he took photos but they turned out like crap, filming may work better. Mom's picking me up in an hour and a half... gonna hex a bit in the meantime I think XD"

"event","OK, short day at uni today... we have a lecture but I skipped it, I need to check through my books for tomorrow.
The fail part then... this morning I was in a rush to the bus because I was all engrossed in a discussion online, so I just threw on my shoes and jacket and ran. Only to realize, later, that my shoes STINK. Fun times. Must have happened after I wore them last week and they got all wet in the rain. Hadn't noticed it... so, I've been walking around in STINKY shoes all day *cries* I tried to hide them as well as I could during the lessons but sometimes I could still smell them and I bet everyone else around me did also, gahhhhh. Fail fail fail. lol

Half-day tomorrow, on wednesday I'm going home to a classmate to work on the examination, then I suppose work on that from home rest of week. Also I somehow ended up promising another classmate I'll go home to her and help her with the computer because apparantly it says ""Please take up my time"" on my forehead. She lives in the same area as me, not sure on exact house but shouldn't take long. But still :P 

GOt home feeling all hungry, but now I feel all restless instead... Gonna have lunch, look through the books and write something together for the seminary tomorrow. Then I can do whatever. STill feeling restless even with that ""little"" to do... I think it's the examination essay starting to lurk in the back of my head... maybe I can put together like the title or whatever and feel better about it. And tonight I need to bath my stinky feet, ugh again!"

"event","Got up later today... like... 7 am? :P
Did some computer stuff (including hexing, yay! Working on a kelpie). I also bathed Dunder last night so today I trimmed him, big trim job in the living room. Suffice to say the whole floor had magically turned into a carpet afterwards... at least he looks pretty now!
I also did laundry today. They've switched to an electronic system which means locked doors and booking electronically and using a ID tag sort of thing... took a bit of figuring out but I got the hang of it now. One nice thing is that they switched the times you book, so you book 4 hours now - before it was 2 or 3 depending on time of day. Plus you can now book around the clock, before it was 8 am - 11 pm. So, even though I had lots of laundry today, I got it all done and with 30 min to spare!
At around 5 pm I took Dunder for a fairly long walk, he behaved very nicely. You know, it's sooo yellow outside now - with the trees and all, I mean. I moved to my apartment about a year ago, I think I moved in at the end of october. I remember saying that it'd be fun to see what it'd look like then next spring when it got all green. Well, now I've seen that... Hm... I wonder if I don't have a photo or two from the first time I saw the apartment (well, 2nd time, first time was a quick visit with the landlord)

Oh yeah..
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v383/Novablue/02-utsikt.jpg"">
The view from novemeber last year. Too lazy to get a new pic (plus it's all dark outside now) but it looks much the same, only the leaves haven't fallen off nearly as much yet, they are mostly on the trees still.

Speaking of darkness, it's starting to get darker and darker quickly now. It's not even 7 pm and fully black. During summer time, it'd be fully light still. A LOT of swedes get really depressed during winter - no big shock there, seeing how dark it gets, ugh! Like, the other day I was feeling such melancholy (what did I say about it being Sweden's national feeling?!) so I decided to look at some photos on DUnder's site from last year to prove to myself that it's not dark ALL the time... and well, they totally ARE all dark, lmao! So much for that... but see for yourself:
http://dunder.lokatt.se/foton-07vinter.htm

I think there was something else I was gonna write but I forgot what it was... oh well! I had really late lunch today, and wasn't hungry by dinner time so I'm just gonna make myself a sandwich and maybe some tea as supper, mmm."

"event","On my way to handling everything that needs to be done!
Let's see...
got home fine last night. One fish is gone O.o one of the males. No trace. My guess is that he died and the others ate him... scary thought but... still strange, you'd think the bones would be left at least? I do NOT look forward to cleaning the tank and stumbling upon guppy bones or something now, ugh!
I woke up at 5:30 am this morning (typical lol), got up and sat and did some computer stuff. I did finish my essays/exercises for uni/monday! Very nice to have that out of the way, fo sho.
So I'm supposed to go to the park today with Jake, but it's raining and is cold and windy - I'm going to call him and ask if we can't move it to next weekend. I think he'll be disappointed but really I have so much to do this weekend and with everything else and the weather and all... next week would really be much more suitable.
I took Dunder for his morning walk at 7 am this morning - cold and windy and rainy! I had him wait outside while I went inside the laundry house thing and booked a time. They've switched to an electronic system (not sure why... the old one worked fine I think!) and I've got a time from noon until 4 pm tomorrow. Would have preferred today to get it out of the way, but then again I need to shop groceries today as well... Though I don't have any clean pants (that I like) for tomorrow XD
Dunder did very well! Granted he only had to wait for like 1 minutes, 2 max, but still! Time was when he's go absolutely nutty a leash-length away from me. He's always been a needy dog, what can I say. Still is, but obviously/as just shown much better now!

I didn't have breakfast yet - plan was to get as much as possible out of the way first. Actually I think I'll call Jake (hope he's up!) after writing this post, and get that taken care of also, then eat and then go shop I suppose! I want to make a ""real"" breakfast though - I've felt at the internship and when eating with my family it just feels a lot more pleasurable if you do it right, a nice setup and maybe light a candle, vs just throw something together and eat while at the comp (classic!).

Well, I'm super hungry now so better get going! XD

EDIT: Well, called Jake and he was OK with moving the park-going... still promised to fix his computer for him but that should go quickly and is nearby the shopping centre, hehe."

"event","Yes, tomorrow is my last internship day, for this time!
Feels nice... So tomorrow I go from 7:40 to 3:30, then home, pack together the last of my things and go home in the evening. I would have liked to stay to saturday or so and just relax, but I'm meeting Jake on saturday so... then plan from there is to do lots of laundry... and on sunday (or better yet, saturday night?!) write together the last stuff I need to do for uni before monday. Then next week we've a few seminaries and such, and then it's time to work on the examination essay. Blah, doing it with this other person rather sucks. If it had been just me I would have been able to get started earlier, plus no need to ""double check"" with her etc. But there you go, not much to do about it. 
On the 21st (we think it is) it's time for loose jumping again. That day we're to work from home or such with the examination essay, so I'll have to talk about not being able to meet up with my partner - which I don't think we had planned to do anyway so no worries there! I'm kinda hoping to ask that we work from home and email back and forth, and perhaps meet up once or twice if needed, but I think it'll be easiest to decide what to do and how to split it up, do our parts, then combine and proof-read, you know? 

After the examination (which is on the 28th) we've a few days of relaxing and taking it easy, then begins the next class... Just checked the schedule (well, it may change, but the planned schedule so far) and I'll have more internship... but it's only 2 weeks (yay lol) and it looks like we've have ""project work"" rather than examination essay this time, which will be interesting. That class will end in january next year. After that comes a class I REALLY look forward to - a looong class (full semester, most are half a semester) named ""Nature, environment and outdoor life"" < 333

Back to more ""immediate"" plans, I'm going to pack together as much as possible tonight, I think, so I can just do the last cleaning of the room and such tomorrow.
I'm pondering getting some photos of the ponies... it's borderline late (strong yellow light due to sunset) but I want a photo of POntus at least... I got of the others... enjoy!

"event","Yes, quick (?) update before heading to bed...
last night I got into  bed late and just couldn't fall asleep! Normally I fall asleep easily, within 15-30 min for sure, but yesterday it took well over an hour. Even though it was much later than I'd usually try to fall asleep, I just wasn't feeling sleepy!

I was afraid I'd be reeeally sleepy at the internship today, but it was OK. Though then again I left at 2 pm today rather than 3:30 so... I went home earlier cause we did ""loose jumping"" with the shetlands today. Both did well! Pontus got a lot of praise from the judge - he really loved it! Beyla only needs to do it 3 more times now to get enough results to get a diploma, which will be a nice merit on her.
Loose jumping is this:
http://www.equine-training.co.uk/jumping.htm (under the ""loose jumping"" section)
Like the page says - "" tremendous fun for horses"" - yep, that was our duo! They LOVED it. I've never seen Pontus so lively, haha. I handled him - at the end (after lots of running already...) the judge wanted to see us trot, so I had to run him with him and gaaawd he was fast... I managed to keep up but I was like dead after 3 laps (well, 3 x half a lap), heh.

Oh! On sunday I was at Buddy's and had meringue suisse and played Wii Family trainer. Had a blast! Whenever I'm at her place, I feel a need to re-decorate and renovate in my apartment... everything is just so nice and new at her place! Mine feels so old and haphazard in comparision... though we've discussed, there's not a lot of point for me to spend lots of time and money fixing up my apartment too much - I'm not exactly going to live there for the rest of my life anyway!

I've also put up a new version of my petz forum Hexie Mania - was getting some big trouble with spam bots lately, mostly porn ones, ugh. I upgraded to PHPbb3, the newest version, it has a lot of great functions - comparing with the old forum I had was like comparing kindergarten with university, as far as settings etc go! So hopefully this new one will be better at handling the bots. They seem to have gotten extra sneaky lately!

Only 3 days left of my internship now... I actually miss my apartment... or rather, my things. And being able to have a bath whenever I want :P I suppose I wish I could have my apartment out here, so I'd still have access to the outdoors and all that, LOL. Maybe one day I'll have my lil house here...

Right now I'm trying to make myself tired... I finished re-reading Hobb's trilogies (the farseer, the ships one and the tawny man). I LOVE those books and they were great because I actually looked forward to waiting/going on the bus since that meant I could read them! Now that I'm done, I feel a sort of void, you know? I grabbed some literature for uni but it's not at all the same to read that :P Still, I suppose at least I'm getting a smidge done that way... I've another such book I can start reading tomorrow, though it looks incredibly boring. We'll see, I guess.

I'm in a sort of odd mood right now... It's hard to describe. It's like a combination of being tired, melancholy and annoyed, heh. I suppose I need some sleep! 
Speaking of melancholy (which, btw, is pretty much the national feeling of Sweden lol) I was reminded of one of my total fave artists, Bauer. He drew a lot of art from swedish folklore (< 3333333333 in itself). Just had to share... lovelovelove his art... How he draws his woods, the dark, looming, magical places, is totally how I picture ""sweden"" more than anything, you know?

[01] Do you have the guts to answer these questions and re-post as The Controversial Survey?
I would think so, given that I stole it and all.

[02] Would you do meth if it was legalized?
No way, I'm against illegal drugs.

[03] Abortion: for or against it?
I'm pro-choice, so I am for it. But I think you need to be very aware of what you're doing and not do it lightly. But quite frankly I don't think most people take it lightly. I doubt any woman would enjoy giving birth to her dead child (yes, that's what you need to do after a certain point). I also tend to feel that abortions should be done as early as possible, easier for mommy too.
Not to mention, say my little sister (currently 11 so perhaps a bit young, say she was 13 or so?) was raped and became pregnant. How could I possibly tell her that no, you can't do an abortion? Come on.

[04] Do you think the world would fail with a female president?
Haha that's stupid, of course not XD There are various female presidents in the world.

[05] Do you believe in the death penalty?
No, I'm not... from what I've been told, there are no statistics that show having a death penalty makes people less likely to commit crime, and I don't really feel any human being has the right to decide who gets to live and who dies (which I suppose could go against my answer on #3 BUT I believe that you're not a human being the minute you're conceived... you're a bunch of cells capable of <i>becoming</i> a human being. Not the same thing.

[06] Do you wish marijuana would be legalized already?
I wouldn't want more ""bad stuff"" available, honestly. I can see for medical use perhaps but then it'd need to be strictly regulated.

[07] Are you for or against premarital sex?
I think it's up to the individual person. For starters, not everyone wants to get married at all! I basically agree with Shan - if you're an adult, everyone involved is clear on the rules and agrees with them and you protect yourself, then knock yourself out.

[08] Do you believe in God?
No, I do not believe in any higher power.

[09] Do you think same sex marriage should be legalized?
YES. 

[10] Do you think it's wrong that so many Hispanics are illegally moving to the USA?
I can't comment much on this because I'm not american and haven't researched it. But I can use my own country as an example. We have a LOT of immigrants coming here, mostly from the Middle East thanks to everything going on there. Some of them come illegaly and such, but consider this - they might get killed in their own country, either for being in the way, or having the ""wrong"" political view, or something else. How could I possibly say ""no, you can't come here to save your life, go away""? 
Having said that, I think you should always strive to become a legal immigrant, either from the start or as soon as possible once you've arrived.

[11] A twelve year old girl has a baby, should she keep it?
Depends entirely on the situation. I think she should have her parents helping to back her up and care for the child - perhaps turning them somewhat more towards sisters rather than mother/daughter, if that makes sense. She has a lot of stuff she needs to do first to become a ""real"" parent, such as finishing school etc, so she'll need lots of help to manage.

[12] Should the alcohol age be lowered to eighteen?
If everyone felt the way I did, alcohol would be illegal all together lol. I've never had a sip of alcohol in my entire life and I don't think I've suffered any for it! Having said that, I know not everyone feels like I do so...
Actually the drinking age is 18 here already, you just can't buy alcohol until you're 21.

[13] Should the war in Iraq be called off?
Like Shan said, you should clean up your mess... But honestly I think this whole damn war has been a lose-lose situation.

[14] Assisted suicide is illegal: do you agree?
I'm more for assisted suicide then against. I think we'd need to be very clear on when a person is serious and wants to die (and aware) and when someone is perhaps going through a very dark period. 

[15] Do you believe in spanking your children?
No, I'm against using physical force to ""teach"". Violence gives birth to more violence.

[16] Would you burn an American flag for a million dollars?
Yes. Like Shan said, it's an object. To me as an outsider, the view some americans have on the subject of patrioism seems rather exaggerated, almost brainwashed, lol!

[17] Who do you think would make a better president? McCain or Obama?
Out of those two, Obama for sure, though to be honest both are way conservative for my tastes. I don't think I've seen a single topic where I agree with McCain yet though...

[18] Are you afraid others will judge you from reading some of your answers?
No, because I've a decent idea on who reads my blog and besides, it's just my personal opinion, it doesn't matter.

"event","Random Nova fact: When I walk next to a person, I strongly prefer for them to be on my left side. I think I've damaged my brain from owning dogs... I spent the first 10 years of my dog training on a working dog club so I've been drilled to always keep the dog on my left side :P Nellie, Tina and Dunder were/are all trained to walk on my left side only, haha.

And I wanna play guitar herrrroooooo. I intend to all night! I'm in my room now to spend some time with Dunder - hardly OK to leave him all day while I'm away and then all evening as well! So here we are... I intend to go and play in say an hour or so though."

"event","Because I've been doing so much this weekend, it feels like it's been longer than it really has! I mean, one could just has well have spent two days in front of the computer, you know? The whole going-back-and-forth to get things etc worked out more nicely than I dared hope;

Saturday - went with dad and younger siblings to a pet store, and another store, on the way back they dropped me off at the apartment, I fetched the things I needed and then took the bus home

Today (sunday) - Met classmate on my way to Jake, then off to him. Helped him install a printer and some other computer related stuff. Took the bus home, celebrated with grandparents, then Buddy came over, we had cake and played Guitar hero. We've had the game for a while, I've just not gotten around to playing it - it was loads of fun! First I was made of fail, then I did pretty well (at Easy level at least...) but then I guess I got tired because I got all sucky again, haha! I shall play more when I get the chance...

it really sucks that I have to get up early tomorrow, blah. I'm not in the mind to go back to my internship at all!"

"event","Yes, been meaning to make an entry for several days but it seems there's always something coming inbetween!
My birthday has passed as has that of my sister... it's been nice, calm celebrations with the family.
...and even know I keep being dragged off (mentally) to look at other things, haha!

Today was a bit of a crazy day. First I had to go to uni to buy this piece of paper - turned out I got the last copy! Then I went around in the city and shopped a bit, mostly gifts (something for Buddy's b-day, a few other things) and bought myself a few new shirts. Then I went to the apartment and had a bath, lunch and packed a few things I need for next week at the farm.
Then home, mostly sat by the comp, walked Dunder... 
This weekend will probably be a bit crazy. I borrowed a couple of books from a classmate. Originally she wanted them back on tuesday when we meet at uni, but then texted me and she wants them this weekend. But they are still at the apartment... just to spice things up I forgot to pick them up today ugh @.@ I don't even know where they are, haha. But then again I suppose come worst I can give her my copies of my books and exchange for her copies (she has them as copied versions rather than ""real"" books) but that's really a lot of hassle... I'm hoping she'll be OK with getting them on sunday. I'll have to go and meet Jake at any rate then - easiest for me would be to first go to my apartment, then to him and then go and leave her books to her in the city and then go back to the farm... gah, hardly the calm sunday I had hoped for! Lots of bus/tram time @___@

Well, tomorrow morning at least I'm going to try to sleep in late! Which in my case means sleeping until say 7 am lol (that's when I woke up this morning at least). 
As for next week, it'll be a bit of an ""eek"" week. Tuesday - uni, gonna do a presentation and a discussion. Then on thursday this woman I've never even met will check on me ""in action"" at my internship to see if I'm suitable teacher material and evaluate me and shizzle O.o;; Rest of the week calm? Then one more week of internship, then back to uni, one week of ""normal"" studying and then examination... 

*yawn* I'm getting tired, time to sleep soon. Oh, I'm gonna be active a bit more in the NCC, a club for cyberdogs, I've been active there twice before. I'm re-doing my cyberdogs website, I hope to change kennel name. I eventually settled on Korpberget. It has emotional ties to me but I'm too lazy to explain them all over again (already did to Shan today :P). I want to draw dogs now, I wish I had my tablet here and my scanner... Well, my parents do have a scanner so provided I can borrow it I can perhaps draw something but meh we'll see."

"event","You know, with the current temperatures and such, it's gotten to the point where it's cooold in my apartment in the mornings, which makes me think it's time to put on the heaters (they've been off since spring) but in the evenings, because of the sun setting outside my windows, it still gets soo dang warm in here...

When I woke up this morning, about an hour ago, there was some massive mist in the valley outside the window, and now it's slowly creeping out over the centre, which is kind of cool. Mist is cool, you know it is.

So, yesterday was one of those fantastic september days - really sunny, and the sun still warmed you, but not the extreme heat of summer. It's a bit crazy to realize that it's mid-september and still the trees are pretty much 100 % green still, not even tinted yellow! Only the birches have slowly begun to change colour but they are still mostly green! 
So, was time to meet Jake yesterday. First I met at his place to help him with the computer, he'd managed to do a few things that he wasn't sure how to change back, like the start menu was at the top of the screen instead of bottom and the clock etc gadgets (he has Vista) had gone missing. Then we were supposed to eat lunch at a place mom recommended, but it was closed - should have been open time-wise but there was no note or anything... We found a place called Blue which is new and looked rather ""hip""... more bar than lunch place really... but I figured it was as good as any. Oh! <img src=""http://www.angeredcentrum.se/img/blueeatdrink.JPG"" title=""""  alt=""Here'"">s a photo from it XD Once there though I realized this was some sort of hang out spot for men in the 50+ who enjoy drinking alcohol at 11:30 am on a saturday O.o It was me, Jake and a bunch of older men stinking of it lol. 
After that, we went for a walk around the area, there is a super nice ""park"" type (not quite, but best I can think of to compare it with) area around there. Oh! And they have made an ""outdoors gym""! First one in Sweden! Basically they've made gym equipment in steel, like children's play ground material? And you can go over there and use them whenever you want, like a playground for adults :P Here's a photo showing part of it:
http://www.vartgoteborg.se/prod/sk/vargotnu.nsf/1/kultur_o_fritid,sveriges_forsta_utegym_invigs_i_angered
So, that was fun!

I read in the newspapers yesterday that they're holding a ""culture day"" in <img src=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slottsskogen"" title=""""  alt=""Slottsskogen""> today, where they're going to basically pretend it's 1908, and show the time of entertainments they had in the early 1900s, so it'll have plays, music, food and all sorts of activities they had back then! I think it sounds really cool. It takes almost an hour for me to go there, so I'd only be able to stay a few hours before going back home, so Dunder isn't left alone too long. You're actually quite allowed to bring dogs there but I don't think I can do that, because I'd need to focus on Dunder rather than everything else going on. They want you to dress in old-fashion clothes too XD I don't really own anything that could be mistaken for clothes from 1908 (or at least I like to think so...) but I found a blouse that looks a bit old-style at least. I suppose I should have worn a long skirt but the only skirt I own is a jeans one, I don't think that'll work, haha. So I'll wear black jazz pants I think, at least they're discreet... And I've a headband and I'll wear one of my old-style necklaces. I'll bring the camera of course so you may get to see photos later XD"

The teacher was amazing. We've done all sorts of stuff... he had us singing in all sorts of ways, and improvising movements to music, and so on. Amazing. At first everyone was a bit shy as to be expected, but I felt us grow as a group and this afternoon, all he had to do was to start playing the, by then, well known melody on his guitar for us to begin singing and dancing - yes, dancing, without being asked to, just because wanted to. Not something most stiff reserved swedes would do just like that, let me tell you! Even I was dancing and singing loudly XD
I had such a blast... and I can't sing, but I enjoy to, but when our class sang... woah, it sounded GOOD. I wish I could have recorded it and shown you guys, it sounded like a freakin choir (of course, we didn have some really talented classmates too haha). On more than one occasion many of us actually got rather tear-eyed because it got so emotional - teacher included! And I think this was great for us as a group/class too, to help us connect and get to know each other more. We mostly talk with our own base groups, but in the last couple of days I've worked with pretty much everyone that was there. Amazing, really amazing, I've never done anything like it before. Now at home I'm sitting here wishing I had such music as we've been playing - I don't for the most part but I found a CD I'm about to put on my MP3 and see if I can't do some dancing myself, crazy as it sounds! I've just had so much fun doing it, without having to worry about looking silly etc. It's a balm for the soul, it really is. There isn't much of this for grownups, is there? The more... silly, not so serious things. I mean, if you're good at singing and dancing you can do it, but for us normal mortals most of us end up quitting both singing and dancing, when in reality it's so much fun - as someone said, when you hear good music, it's just impossible to remain still, it does something to the human body, you know? And as the teacher said, all humans have the right to enjoy music.

I wrote down the lyrics for the 2 songs we've done the most (we've also written a bunch of them ourselves as part of everything we've done!) so that I won't forget them, because I want to always be able to remember these 2 days.
Haha - I've no idea how to spell it, but here's one we've done so much; nonsense lyrics I suppose, means nothing (in swedish at least!)

Ah lo-weh, Ah lo-weh, Ah lo-weh
Ah lo-weh, Ah lo-weh, Ah lo-weh
Wah! Ah le-leh, Wah! Ah le-leh, 
Ah Rikki Tikki Tava, Ah Rikki Tikki Tava
Ah busha, busha busha
Ah busha, busha busha

For each line, we had to make up movements, they are quite silly but really fun! For the last one, you do that classic ""gorilla"" move of leaning forward, elbows out and hands by your chest and moving your arms up and down why saying it XD We've been joking we'll have to make sure to sing this song together in the class when we've f.ex. a boring lecture to get us all to loosen up and just have a bit of fun!

Might as well do the other song, a quick english translation;

I have no money
But I want to offer you a dance
(repeat)

Grab your guitar and your hat
Stand on the market-place and sing a song
if someone offers you a bit of money
Dance with me, keep going!

The 2nd last line makes little sense, literal translation would be ""if someone lightens their purse"", basically a playful way of describing someone offering you money, for singing well or such, not like paying you to dance for them as such :P

well, media player is done ripping music, off I am!"

Made two videos yesterday... nothing amazing, just wanted to work with clips and music for a bit.

Basic one on Lakrits:

Was a bit hard to phrase the last text piece cause dumping cats is horrible, but it may sound odd to post that alone, since if someone hadn't dumped Lakrits we wouldn't have her, and we love her. You get at what I'm saying?

"event","So, I've had a calm weekend for the most part. Went to the farm on friday night. Stayed indoors most of saturday because it was raining and stuff... was so nice to hang out with the dogs though. Mom says I'm clearly Viggo's favourite and it does seem to ring true, he follows me around the house and wags his tail every time I look at him, haha. Elsa is going through one of those lovely ""Omg everything in scary and needs to be barked at"" stages, ugh. On a nice note, Flizan is SO much better these days. She's really calmed down. She doesn't bark at me (or others, for the most part) anymore. I can't exactly just walk up to her and grab her, you need to read her carefully to make sure you're not taking things too far with her, but she enjoys cuddling and playing with me.

Yesterday we went shopping (me, mom, dad, brother D). I didn't buy food as such but I got some other things like a small calendar and some other items. We also went to a few shoe stores. First had nice shoes but GAWD were they expensive! It was like O.O Then we went to a store where they always have this offer of ""pick three pairs, pay for two"". The downside with that store is that I need woman's size 42 with our system, but they always have up to 41 only... Actually, as far as <i>length</i> goes I have like 39-40, but because of my stupid broad feet I usually need 42 for width. So all my shoes are too long for my feet *sigh* So I had to look among the men's shoes, but eventually found a few pairs that work. I needed autumn/winter shoes - I did find various ones that did fit but wouldn't have lasted a minute in the rain or cold, but the ones I eventually found where nice. Not to mention - for those three pairs, I paid less than what I would have paid for *one* pair in the first store!

In the afternoon we went to grandma and had dinner, whole fam minus brother D. He had wanted to go but was just way too tired, and had to go home to his home instead. It was nice and we got ino a nice story telling setting with lots of laughs. Once home I went to bed early, was tired after everything.

This morning everyone except brother M had gone to school, and me and mom had a really nice breakfast together. Growing up with 5 siblings, it's always been a luxury when you actually spend time with your parents and no one else, so I've always greatly valued those moments. And it's been a long time since it was just me and mom sitting there together. So that was really nice. We had porridge, eggs and a sandwich - I was soooo full though I couldn't finish any of it haha.
After breakfast we left and she drove me home - I'd love to have stayed, but I need to study today for uni tomorrow, le sigh. I was actually sort of happy about going back, but now that I ended with such a sweet note at the farm I wish I was there already!
I tell myself that in 2 weeks, I'm going to stay there for 3 weeks though due to an internship, so it's really nothing to miss, you know? But it's a bit hard to tell yourself that when you sit alone!

Dunder is, as always, super happy with being home. And like always, he began by checking and making sure everything is in order, then crashed in the bed. I don't think he ever sleeps as heavily as during these moments!
I'm going to finish packing up and then I should get studying I guess, ugh!"

"event","Woo friday!
Plan for today - first we've a lecture, then base group discussions. I'm hoping we can be done with those in a couple of hours or so. Then I'm going by Pandur, a hobby store, to buy some paints and signs. I talked to mom about such paints and she agreed they're friggin expensive - for 200 SEK (30 USD) I can get a grand total of 5 colours O.O I mean, they last forever but still! I think I'll get a few colours to get me started and we'll see. I'm also going to buy some signs - I've an idea to make one for Buddy for sure and perhaps one for mom/dad as an xmas gift, and maybe even one for myself. We'll see. Then once home... well, haven't decided yet if I'll go to the farm tonight or tomorrow, but we'll see.

Yesterday, poor Dunder had to be alone so much... I was at uni from 9-2:45 (plus traveling time, so 8-3:15 or so pm) and mom hadn't managed to come by and walk him during the day, but he had behaved so well, nothing out of order, no accidents or anything. I could tell he needed to go out quickly though, or rather he did his business quickly once outside. He's really very good with being alone. I mean... if there's something edible in his reach he WILL eat it, and go through trash if he gets the chance. But besides that, he acts like an angel, doesn't chew or anything. I believe he spends most of his day sleeping.
I had dinner (had friggin nothing at home to eat, ugh) and then I actually went down to shop. I felt bad about leaving Dunder again, but it didn't take long, less than 2 hours (more like 1 hour) and now I've restocked the fridge at least. I bought him ox ears to make up for being alone, he got one last night and I'll give him one before I leave.
You know, it's so cool how well dogs can learn to understand you. Since it's just me and Dunder in the apartment, I do speak a lot to him so he's picked up a few things. Like yesterday, I was laying in bed reading with him draped across me as usual when I've been away for a long time during the day (he gets super clingy then, and of course I let him get that contact he wants/needs) and I turn to him and speak to him - outdoors he's so caught up in everything often that sort of thing just flies over his head, but indoors it's almost scary how closely he'll watch you and listen to you when you speak to him. ANyway, so I ask him ""Hey Dunder, where's your ear?"" He looks at me, then wanders straight off to find what remains of the ox ear! When he looks at you like that, you can really see the gears turn in his head to figure out what you want him to do. 

I have to leave in about 10 min... ish, just naturally got some massive rain! I have no good shoes for this weather - I need new autumn shoes really bad, but I really don't want to go into the city and look for them. Because of my badly shapen feet (it's not something you may see looking at them... except they're a bit flat lol) it's a real pain to find shoes that fit, nevermind ones that look good *sigh* I'll bring my umbrella at least... it's from Liseberg, purple with lightning and says ""Dunder och brak"" (""Rumble and noise"" - makes no sense I know but it's a thunder term, I guess a better, though not literal, translation in english would be ""lightning and thunder"")

So back to Dunder, he'll be alone today but not for super long... 8 - 3 pm, possibly, maybe 2 pm if I can push it. Depends on how long the base group discussion takes, but everyone in the group wants to go home as quick as possible, especially on a friday haha. So yah, we'll see about that, and while I don't want to really, I'll hurry to get through the paints etc quickly. At least I was home tuesday and wednesday, and now we've the weekend coming up, so I don't think Dunder has suffered much, I just really don't want to leave him alone for so many hours with no walk. I didn't ""book"" mom today since I figure it's not too bad, but it's borderline."

"event","I've today and tomorrow off. Or well, not really off.... just studying from home :P I'm going to pick up my books soon, just not sure when that store opens (remember, no postal offices in Sweden anymore! You pick up packages in nearby stores and such) so I don't want to leave too early, it' just past 8 am. 
Plan is to study today and tomorrow (and I really need to do laundry too...) and friday I'm hoping will be fairly short, so then I plan to drop by the crafts store and buy some paints and such... I'd love to get it now but it's too much work to go into the city just for that haha. And I've not gotten my money yet either. But by friday it should have gotten here.

So in uni, we have a big class, split into 2-3 seminary groups, and then split into ""base groups"". The idea of the base group is to form a tight group to help each other with studying, discussions and so on. We were 6 people in our group last year. Out of those, we were 3 people that were decidedly active. Then we had two people who did some but mostly didn't help in the discussions, and one person who helped, kinda, but ALWAYS (seriously, every single time we had a meeting) ""had parking running out"" so ALWAYS left early. ALWAYS. Nevermind it said on the schedule we had time until 4, she still put in money until say 3 pm so then she ""had"" to leave. Gah, that drove me nuts. Now, this semester, 2 people have quit from our group - ms leaving-early (yay!) and one of the people that work less than anyone else.
Out of those that remain, two are really tight because they were in the same class before this one, me, and one that does a bit less. Now, for the exam in this class, you're to work 2 and 2. So naturally, the tight buddies will work together... and I was asked by the other person in the group if we could, and said yes of course (what was I going to say? Besides, I've no one else to ask either). I do feel a bit iffy though because thing is, last class, this classmate failed her examination, and asked me for loads of help to help her fix it up so she could at least pass the class... so yeah, I just have a ""hunch"" that I'll be the one doing most of the work this time around too! It's nothing personal against her, it's just annoying to know you'll be the one doing the majority of work... I keep telling myself that I can pretend it's a normal ""do it yourself"" examination and that if you see it that way, instead of doing it all myself, I'll be doing slightly less than I usually do, so it's still better than if I did it all by myself?! Dunno, we'll see how that goes. This class feels short... 3 weeks in uni, 3 weeks of internship and then 2-3 weeks of examination stuff, more or less. We'll see how it all goes..."

"event","I've more energy, but gah, my poor throat... still hurts, both when I talk and when I swallow. As soon as I get more money, I'm going to get some honey so I can make tea with honey. Tea without honey will have to do in the meantime :P
First day at uni went well, thought it felt like it'd never end... I thought we'd get lots of confusing info and papers and such but it wasn't bad. I think I'll get back into the swing fairly quickly. Plus both tomorrow and wednesday I get to study from home, so that's nice. 
I had very little energy though and was ready to drop once home. It's so nice to get home to a happy dog! Too bad Dunder can't also prepare a dinner waiting when I get home :P But I took him out and he was all crazy so I let him do a bit of obedience to let him use some of that energy. Mom was kind enough to drop by by lunch time and walk him too.
Last week I was home for a few hours, without Dunder (went home right after work and then had dad pick me up, as I needed to take care of some things) and I missed him so bad even though it was just a few hours! I mean, he's always following me around and keeping an eye on me. It felt so quiet without him. Don't know how I'd manage to live on my own without him. Nellie was quite velcro too, Tina not so much... no one can beat Dunder though. I've been re-reading my beloved Fitz books (the Farseer Trilogy, on the Tawny Man trilogy now) and I can't help but be put in mind of Fitz' bond with Nighteyes when I think of me and Dunder!"

"event","Yeah, I do... to put it gently. Blah. But, let's go in order...

Back from the farm! Got back last night. Like always, it's bittersweet. I enjoy having my bathroom and my own bed and see my fish and my stuff, but I miss my family after an hour or two and then I feel all lonely. Odd as it may sound, I suspect some may actually be because my MP3 is dying, dying, dying... First I had that thing when it got wet and the fast forward stopped working, then the headphones died, I put on my other ones I use for the computer occasionally, then one part of it broke off. I intend to tape it together but didn't do that yet. So walks and such, no music, no occupying my mind, you know? Just me and a lot of quietness.

Yesterday Viggo did his MH! I was nervous before because I didn't know what to expect or fully do or anything like that. But it was really relaxed and they took great care of me and Viggo. Haha  - he was FAR more interested in smelling though than he was of ghosts, loud noises and sudden movements! I was really happy to see how well he handled gunshot - lifted his head the first time then completely ignored it, he did better than I thought he might. Especially as he had actually never heard gunshot before! (Used to all sorts of noises though). So we wrote to the breeder yesterday (just a quick guestbook entry) and I'm going to put in the results as soon as I've the energy. You know, on the entire stud list of the cavalier club, only 3 others can brag about having done this test, so it's a nice merit. I mean, now we've got proof on his conformation and his mentality - just physical health left! Can't do that until he's 2 years old though ;) He'll have heart, eyes and knees done for sure, possibly also hips (depends on mom - it's not required in the breed but it doesn't hurt). And as far as syringomyelia goes... no good testing besides a MRI O.O So no one tests for that currently. But he's never given any symptoms (which they often do, though not always). The thing with syringo is that it's so common in the breed you can't just exclude all dogs that carry it from breeding, then you'd end up with a bunch of inbred dogs. Since inbreeding is what caused the heart and syringo problems in the first place, not the smartest thing to do!
Oh and off leash? No problem. I'm glad it was Viggo though. Elsa or Flizan (ha, that'd be interesting to test!) would probably not stay as near. Especially not Elsa. I TOTALLY want to test Dunder now, though! Maybe next spring. It'd be awesome to see what he'd get.

So, me feeling crap then. Began for real yesterday afternoon - my throat was beginning to feel kinda dry and hurt when I swallowed. Then I started to get SUPER tired - at the time I thought it was just relaxing after having been nervous (which I still think is part of the reason, but not the full one). Then I got all cold, which isn't typical for me - as a matter of fact, dad had teased me during dinner because I whined that the wind was chilly (we were eating outdoors) - something like ""You're cold?! This coming from the person who walks around in a t-shirt when it's minus degrees?!"". Which isn't too far from the truth, lol.
Kept feeling like crap and it kept getting worse - I took a bath last night and even sitting in the tub, I had goosebumps from feeling cold on the parts not submerged. And that was a hot bath! Needless to say I was all but shivering when I got out of the bath. I had an egg sandwich and tea (and cold water cause I still think it's odd to drink something warm, lol!) and all but crashed into bed at 9:30. Had a really hard time falling asleep though - head pounded, throat hurt and above all... soo cold... And at this point it was 24 C in my apartment (normally I prefer 20 C) and with the windows closed (I always sleep with them open).
Took ages to fall asleep, then I woke up at 2 am and had a super hard time falling asleep again, especially as someone was having a party - couldn't hear the music but I could sense the base/drums.
Woke up once more but managed to fall asleep a bit quicker that time.
Finally got up at 6 am. I feel a smidge better than last night but not by much... My throat and also my ears hurt a bit, tired still but now I'm not as cold, at least. I've not even dressed yet.... I think the fresh air will do me good when I take Dunder for his morning walk. Besides that, I'm going to try to spend as much as possible of the day resting. I mean, uni begins tomorrow - UGH perfect timing yeah?! Hopefully it won't be too demanding. I have to go though, no excuse, there will be important info and the likes *sigh*"

"event","Yes, I've done lots! Not so much today yet though (haven't even had breakfast yet...) but yesterday!
Let's see... I did vacuum, but more than that I went through and cleaned out two cupboards/closests and stuff, threw away a lot of junk and put everything in order. Now I know exactly where those things are which is good. I also put in lots of old bills and notes and important papers in their respective files. I hate doing that, so boring and I need more files now too because the ones I do have are getting so full...

I need to vacuum today again though before leaving, cause I did a half-assed job at it yesterday... ah well...
I wanted to give Dunder some real exercise because we've failed at that this weekend, so I went into the woods opposite of my apartment. It's super steep and has trails where I know people go, so I tried to find a more secluded spot where I could take off his leash without us having to worry so much about running into another dog. I found such an area... and it didn't take much pondering to realize why chances are no one goes there. Word to the wise - don't try climbing a combination of mountain and stream and good in crocs. My poor knee...
Well, Dunder enjoyed himself and came home super dirty and very tired. So much for that bath he had! I should really trim him this week at the farm too, to get that done and over with.

In the evening I ended up lightning some scented candles as well as well... I don't know what it's called even in english, haha. You know scented oil, like this?
http://www.justperfectgifts.com.au/images/candles/OilBurner.jpg
Like that, except not with oil but with a sort of piece that looks like candle wax. Smells a lot more than oil does, too! It smelled so nice... but unfortunately it was the last one I had. I have to ask mom where she got them (was a birthday (or xmas?) gift from her).
I also lit a few candles from IKEA, and sat by the window and read... Been re-reading The Farseer trilogy, at the 2nd book. I figured I'd bring a book or two for reading at the farm during the week.
Blah... work tomorrow :P I also ordered the first 2 books for uni (only got the ones we were recommended to start with for now - maybe I can find the others for cheap or loan from the library...) and they'll prolly arrive during next week, since I won't be home then I'll have to figure something out in terms of how to pick them up etc. I'll probably go right home after work one day and try to pay and then go back to the farm or something. I'll get a text message when it's arrived, so that's good! Maybe if I'm lucky I'll even get it on friday or so, then I can pick it up when I go back to the farm. It'd take 3-6 days it says but I know how they can be so I might actually get it after uni has started... but we'll see, we'll see...

PLan today is to go to the farm after lunch - gonna finish off the last of the lasagna and mom said they're gonna barbeque tonight.
Haha - I told this to Shan already (or most of it) but I may as well tell it here also...
Beyla's full name = Sollidens Beyla Bus, bus means mischief.
1) A few days ago, as they were checking on the ponies (which they do a few times a day) they realized Beyla had found a new spot... namely inside this triangle of fence that we put in around a kinda ""bad"" area (ie one where they may trip or get caught) - she had just crept under or through the fencing (we use this kind http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k6/homeisland/S5030537.jpg ) Since that little triangle has no electricity, she hadn't had any probs getting through, and was now inside there happily munching on the grass the others couldn't reach...
2 ) My parents remove her and remove the triangle as well.
3 ) A day or so later, a neighbor calls, Beyla is standing on the road... They had tried to put her back in the pasture, she was being herself (ie miss Mischief) until they got very firm and ""angry"" which made her go ""sorry sorry"" and they could get her back, even though she wasn't wearing a halter or anything. Turns out someone in the stable the pastures connect to had turned off the electricity... which meant ALL pastures around the area had none (well, minus our winter pastures, but the horses weren't in those now were they...). A cow had also gotten out and had panicked when it was on its own and gotten caught and hurt itself somehow :(
4 ) My parents took the horses to our winter pastures (the ones with gravel). Beyla crawls under and as my parents come home from a trip they see her happily standing and munching grass in the middle of the field...
5 ) She's put in a box, not impressed with that... While my parents fence in a new pasture on the smaller field by the farm (the one we got our hay from). Last time I spoke with mom they were still working on that, I'm guessing they'll use 3 levels of bands rather than 2... Let's hope she'll stay inside this time! Beyla Mischief indeed..."

"event","Made lasagna yesterday, mmmm... Turned out nice... But I had forgotten to buy veggies, all I had at home was carrots and half a red onion, haha. But that worked well too. Now I've something ready to eat today and tomorrow for dinner and/or lunch at least. I'm going back to the farm tomorrow night.
I feel so lonely lately... It's odd, I don't remember being this lonely before the summer. I think maybe it's because I don't go to uni now, yeah I spent many days studying at home but I had something I had to do and still met people a few times a week, you know? Now it's just me and Dunder doing not much.
Well, today I'm going to finish my conf. That's pretty much all I *have* to do. I also need to vacuum... 

Oh! My guppy gave birth! To a grand total of 1 fry O.o that doesn't sound right. I don't know if they ate the rest or if they are hiding... suspecting the first but hoping for the 2nd! I've only see one, but I've not seen it this morning. Hope they didn't eat that one too.... I got new tank stuff last week but forgot it at the farm, ugh. I'm bringing it home next weekend. It's more gravel, more plastic plants and a good decoration. Normally I don't care for those, I think it tends to look a bit tacky, but this one was a cool dino skeleton, head perched on a branch (hard to explain, I'll get a photo). It was pricey... but it looked so cool! ANd it could provide plenty of hiding space for fry. Hopefully this ickle one will survive until next week then... 
The other guppies seem alert and such though. They obviously associate with me food now because they come swimming at full speed whenever they see me, haha. Last night I was in my bed which is next to the tank reading, turned my head and saw six guppies staring at me like O.O all packed in the corner nearest me LOL

Blah, I don't feel like working... but the money will be sweet.I know I said I didn't need to worry about my money anymore this summer but as my typical luck would have it, I got a new bunch of bills and such JUST right now so I'm suddenly super-low again. Makes me wonder how I'd managed if I hadn't worked... I would have needed to borrow money from my parents, hands down. I've definintely learnt my lesson for next summer though and will start saving up even now in september for it!
Fortunately, it actually looks like I'll get paid in the beginning of september! I was checking yesterday on the student loan site and apparantly I've got one payment coming when I begin studying, which I do on the 1st, so 1st-2nd week of september? Mighty sweet for sure, especially since I get a payment at the end of september too! I'm quite sure I'll live until then, I'm just worried in case something does come up. I mean, it's not a SUPER crisis because I know my parents will help me, but I'm like worried what if money is taken from my account for something I've forgotten about, then I don't have enough my rent on friday you know? Cause I won't be home then so I won't even have access to my bank shizzle.

I ordered a thingie for my parents for xmas. Fantastic timing with the money and all, I know... lol. It's a sun protection for a car, like this:

But with this pic instead:
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v383/Novablue/3-8.jpg
Hopefully it'll turn out alright! I hope they'll like it. It'll take about 10 days to get here so I think I'll have it at the beginning of september.

Ugh, I need to order school books today. I've intentionally waited with it so I wouldn't get the bill too early. If I order today I think I'll get them next week which would be good. It's gonna be evilly expensive though, they're not cheap this semester... ugh I say, ugh."

"event","Haha, just had a phone call with mom that went something like this:
""So anyway I found a pony you should buy""
""O rly""
""Yeah, he's a one year old, chestnut with white mane and tail""
""Great, beause I need something so spend my countless money on""
""Exactly""
""What breed is he?""
""Shetland"" (well duh really but I had to ask haha)
""Sounds sweet, you know my money situation though""
""Still, just 5000 SEK, he's so cheap... And with that pedigree...""
And she told me a bit about his pedigree etc. I told her to send him to me as a birthday present :P
Haha, I've actually voiced the idea before to her that I'd enjoy having a little pony of myself one day. More to show, maybe do carting with and just cuddle with. Me riding a shetland would be animal abuse XD
Me coughing up that money is out of the question but the seed of interest has been planted *sigh* Here he is:
http://hastmarknad.hastnet.se/sok/annons.php?aid=187644
Mommy's elite class with several BIS wins, she's black. Dad's a champion, same colour as him... Here's daddy:
http://www.shetlandvast.se/bilder/grattis/esg_2006_kompisyrrol.jpg
 He wouldn't be ready to move until december but can be reserved/promised now, only to a home where he'll be staying for keeps though.

damn you mom for placing this seed of WANT!

EDIT: Oh and I think I know what I'm getting Buddy for her birthday (oct 1st) this year... I like to make/buy personal gifts...
http://www.fujidirekt.se/asp/_shop/bags/
a bag, with a photo of her dalis on there! Or one of them at least - I don't know if I have a good recent photo with both on there. Or I could make a graphic (like both dogs and saying her name on it?). I think that'd be neat. I'm going for the type of bag as the one with the cityscape on it. I'd love if someone got me something that personal so I hope she will too. For my parents (xmas) I'd like to paint a welcome sign, I don't have paints or one of those litlte wooden signs though, so I need to get that first and then paint it with mom's colours without her realizing it :P Unless I think of something else to put it on which is another possibility.... OOoo they let you order your own ""Book"" which I may do, and do one about hte farm you know? they are kinda pricey, though, but if it's a combined combo for mom and dad it'd be OK."

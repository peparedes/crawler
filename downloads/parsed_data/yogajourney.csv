"event","I'm not sure why the people I work with are so negative about most things.&nbsp; I've found that keeping positive around most of them helps them but, there is one in particular that I simply can not get through to...and he is very important to me.&nbsp; I used to provide joy and comfort for him, a friend and listened... but the situation now...I can't even break through to a slight hint of hope. It's a complete road block and when I try to talk about it...it sounds like I'm whinning for attention. 

It's hard wanting so badly to be there for a person who won't let you be there for him.&nbsp; Then I feel selfish for saying that ...he is acting that way because it is a situation that is very hard for him.&nbsp; I feel his pain mirrored in my heart and it's hard for me to smile knowing it. I want to show him that spring always comes back after a cold, barren winter. 

...but my lesson here, I suppose, is that I can't lead really a person to happiness.&nbsp; I'm wearing myself out trying, yet he seems determined to be miserable. I show him light and he closes his eyes.&nbsp; I smile and he frowns.&nbsp; I can't let him bring me down....how do I help him understand the things that I understand about life?&nbsp; Are there&nbsp; really just some people that just refuse to be happy?"

"event","Ok so maybe it's only the slightest change, and maybe I'm exaggerating...but I felt so alive when I woke up this morning.&nbsp; A combination of a good night's sleep and the fact that I've already lost 2.5 lbs in 3 days of Bikram torture? I know I should stay off the scale but I couldn't help it after I looked in the mirror this morning, just to convince myself that it's not all in my head that I feel a little better already.

Ok so the correct thing to do would be to smile at myself in the mirror, get dressed, have some fruit and maybe tea...and just be happy.&nbsp; Instead I have to go and get on the scale and measure up. How I feel is more important than the scale. Got to drill that into my head.


...but regardless, there are little rays of sunshine in my head today.&nbsp; Nobody's gonna steal my peace today."

"event","..but if it doesn't hurt, you're not doing it right.

I can't really call it my fourth day, the way I'd like to... the first two days my practice was interrupted in the middle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night was my second complete session, and I was in bed by midnight.&nbsp; I would like to get my schedule rearranged so I can do my yoga in the morning, but I'm usually at work late...and I know I won't drag myself out of bed early enough so I do it before I fall asleep.

I can't believe how out of shape I've gotten.&nbsp; My knees and ankles complain like an old lady. ( I have to stop wearing heels on this floor. )&nbsp; My balance isn't as bad as I thought it would be....but I have to put a wooden shelf-board under my feet for the balancing poses because my carpet is so thick it messes with me (Who invented carpet anyway?).&nbsp; 

This is a difficult business for someone like me to be in (the restaurant business). I have a love/hate relationship with it.&nbsp; I&nbsp; love that every day is different, and I get to meet so many people, and that so much responsibility falls on me because I'm trusted, and it's awesome to learn the details of fine service, cuisine, and wine....but I have some frustrations.&nbsp; Having every day be different keeps me on my toes , but consistency is nice every once in a while, having a lot of people around is good too,&nbsp; many people know my name, but I don't know theirs...and I'm so busy running around that I don't get to know who they are, I only have time to pretend!&nbsp; ""Oh hi so-and-so, how's your daughter..."" and it's all so fake even though many of them are wonderful people.&nbsp; As far as the responsibility goes, well...I operate the restaurant from top to bottom.&nbsp; The owner used to work with me but now I hardly ever see him and I am responsible for every tiny detail...he only stops in to check up on reports and whatnot.&nbsp; I stress about the business like it is my own, yet the pay doesn't match the responsibility or the hours.&nbsp; 

Also, the people that I work with are very high strung night-crawlers that I have little in common with.&nbsp; They complain about absolutely everything. You would think they are perpetually miserable.&nbsp; They drink every night, then complain even louder, and have heated arguments that make me want to cringe.&nbsp; ---Don't get me wrong, I enjoy having a glass of wine at the end of the night... but I get a headache just thinking about their lifestyle. I've been there and I grew out of it a while ago.&nbsp; (odd that most of them are older than me?)

Anyway...I'm sure one of these days I'll start making entries that aren't books...I started out talking about being out of shape and feeling the burn today and completely deviated.&nbsp; I should get back to work.

"event","I first discovered Bikram's Hatha Yoga when I was 15... on my sister's bookshelf.&nbsp; It was the first paperback publication, 1978 I think, a thick red and white book.&nbsp; I had never heard of yoga, and my sister probably hadn't touched the book since she bought it.&nbsp; I asked if I could borrow it, then went home and read the book from front to back.&nbsp; I always loved to read, but I had never paid much attention to physical fitness aside from my roller skating championships. (There were no ice rinks in Mississippi, not much of anything actually, so did what was within my reach and became a roller figure-skater...which seems kind of silly in my adulthood.) After I read the book full of promises and postures to heal ailments that I'd never heard of, I asked to borrow my father's space heater.&nbsp; He raised his eyebrow at me, considering the mid-July Mississippi heat...but he was used to my wackiness and didn't ask. For the next month I spent about 3 hours a day locked in my little bedroom, carefully reading and re-reading the instructions for each posture along with Bikram's quirky classroom chatter while practicing the postures and found myself completely absorbed. 

I hadn't been paying much attention to the health benefits really.&nbsp; I liked that I was limbering up and felt sleek, but I really didn't think much about it. I was 15 and still ate an entire bag of Doritos at one sitting. It was just kind of fun to me, and I never wanted to grow up...the book promised that I would be ageless.&nbsp; I believed it.&nbsp; :) If anyone asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up, I said I wanted to teach yoga. Everyone thought it was silly...but not unlike me so say such a thing.

School started again and I joined the basketball team.&nbsp; I had never really been able to play very well...but this year I got comments on how graceful I moved. My rollerskating improved.&nbsp; I got comments on the simple thing of how I walk..that I moved like a ballerina and seemed to feel everything I touch.&nbsp; It was true, and I thought it must be the yoga. &nbsp;

Late teens came around and with little true discipline I started getting rambunctious. I stopped my skating, it wasn't cool anymore.&nbsp; I got a car and was hardly ever home after school.&nbsp; I got a boyfriend, traveled, had fun...eventually got married..and forgot all about yoga for myself, but bought at least ten copies of the book to give as gifts to friends who were complaining of anything and everything. I got frustrated with them when they would put it on their bookshelf just like my sister did, and not read it or take it seriously...but in the past few years I had not done much more than that myself.&nbsp; How could I have this knowledge and not use it...not follow through, how weak was I? 

In college I had to pick a physical education elective, so of course I picked yoga. It was a class that I could not take seriously.&nbsp; The teacher was more out of shape than the students and made up names for made up poses...I knew it was wrong...but I had to pass the class so I kept my mouth shut. I graduated, got a job, realized my marriage was toxic, got a divorce, read lots of books, got depressed, moved back home, traveled some, moved again, decided to go back to school...but in an attempt to pay off my student loan bills and debts incurred from panicked travels during a tumultuous time in my life, I landed right smack in the middle of a fast paced,stressful restaurant business.&nbsp; Now I manage and operate a 150 seat fine dining restaurant.&nbsp; I have studied wines and fine cuisine, I know the details of service. I know how to wear high heels for twelve hours straight on cement and terra cotta tile floors.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...and I've gotten weak in the ways that matter.

The few things that have kept me sane and reminded me of the poetic, breezy person I used to be are my philosophy books and my journals and Sunday trips to the bookstore.&nbsp; Bikram's new book came out and I eyed it up on the bookshelf for at least three weeks. I even sat in the aisle floor at the store and read a few pages here and there.&nbsp; I had a difficult time buying it because I knew the commitment I needed wouldn't come from a book. After all, I already have two copies of the second edition and one of the first at my apartment.&nbsp; A book is NOT going to make me do yoga, I thought.&nbsp; So what did I do? I went to the gym...and to work...and listened to my boss complain that he's been going to the gym for months and nothing has changed except his knees hurt and he's pulled a few muscles.&nbsp; The whole time I'm thinking ""I know why...."".

The next Sunday I bought the book...and bought two mini space heaters (which blow the fuses at my apartment..nothing else can be on while I do my yoga) and I started once again my journey. As I gently submitted to the postures for the first time in years, I felt an unbelievable sensation.&nbsp; Like clearing an inch of dust off a beautiful antique table....or like a plant starved with thirst, re-opening it's leaves as water fills its veins.&nbsp; It was the most natural but difficult thing I've done in years.

It will take commitment. I am determined. It's a knowledge that I've carried dormant with me for 12 years now....and a goal that I never fulfilled because no-one really believed in it.&nbsp; Now I know that nobody has to believe it but me, and I know what I was meant to do.&nbsp; When you're on the right track, you know it...it makes sense.&nbsp; This is my mission statement...and this journal is to record my progress, accomplishments and failures.&nbsp; I'm trimming down my spending, paying off debts, and saving money for Bikram's teacher training.&nbsp; It will be at least another year or so before I can afford it..but in that time I have plenty to catch up on...and plenty of soul searching and self disciplining to do.

The new book, by the way, is way more in depth than the others were.&nbsp; It's well worth it, even if you own three others , like me.&nbsp; It tells Bikram's story and elaborates on many important topics that were merely mentioned in the original books.&nbsp; It is an inspiration to everyone who knows what yoga really is, a lesson for those who don't, and a reality check for every soccer mom in her designer yoga gear who THINKS she's doing yoga. I wish the world would read this book ."

Q's class without colleen kimmi or even david. 4th per was better than it was last semester and that was a total surprise. and 5th per was the worst, i offically have gym this year and i am like the lazyiest and unfit person ever. i guess it could be a good thing that i have P.E. this year cuz i definatly gained some weight since break let out. lunch was really boring cuz like everyone was gone. jessica and monica are no longer at our table. so now its just me kimmi david and colleen. 6th per was actually ok until she gave us all the work, 7 pages of grammar shit and everyone knos im not good with that one. 7th per was the only class of mine that didnt change and all of the ppl that were in it before were still in it with the exception of a few. i talked to zach a little bit about his car accident. i swear he has the worst luck ever, he just got a bran new really hott truck and he just totaled it this week. i felt really bad and told him i was so sorry and he looked really really upset. i mean who couldnt blame him i would be too if that happened to me. i was kinda happy tho cuz david apologized again buh i kno it was only cuz of steph and how bad she made him feel. thats ok tho, its too bad we still cant to our book swaps for van dora im actually gonna have to do work! ewwie!

"event","yea my house definatly got broken into the other day. its sucks ASS! me and kimmi were comming home from taco bell on wed and yea my house was trashed. my moms credit cards were all over the place, shit was thrown every where. in my room all of my stuff was knocked over and out of  place. all of my draws were open and gone through. i was soo pissed u have no idea. i wanted to hurt sumone. they stole our ps2, keys to the house and to our cars, my moms cell, her jewlery, $, our laptop and a video camera. and to top it all off the next night they made a bomb threat to the cops from my moms cell and the cops showed up at our house and were gonna arrest my rents ( parents). i was so horrified i came home from babysitting at midnight and there were 3 cops in the drive way. the first thing that came to mind was HOLY FUCKIN SHIT!!! i was like no not u guys again. and thats not the worst..... wow guys i feel like a lil slut! definatly hooked up with 2 guys in one week and i kinda have a ""friend with benefits""... when i was with one of them last night brian called twice and it was really weird, i didnt tell him that i was hangin out with sumone else cuz were broken up so it shouldnt matter and he was doin the same thing.buh it felt wrong not saying nething. he went on and on about getting drunk and shit like that. i uno im glad we talked buh i have a feeling we wont talk again for a while. i kinda miss him buh i kno we would never work out and we would be better off as friends. so hopefully we can atleast be friends. lets just hope it all works out.... im happy cuz i get to get my waffle maker tomorrow from target. its really cute its a tigger and pooh waffle maker. so i can have 2 waffles every morning one of pooh bear and the other of tigger. isnt that really awsome! well atleast i think so. wow i miss KK soo much, im going through KK withdrawl... and she wont be back for another 3 days isnt that horrible! im sad. some one help! quick!! im so confused. wow shit is really fucked up... buh then again when am i never not confused?"

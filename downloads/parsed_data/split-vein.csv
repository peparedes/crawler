"event","Him:  Speaking of tricks and all that, and because I'm such a dork, I thought of some excuse for this mark on my face.. I have no idea what it is or where it came from, but anyway .. People were asking and I was jus'like ""I dunnooo"" and then like.. 48 hours later I started thinking of what I shoulda said, cause I do that. And.. I thought of something.. like this:  I was rollin down Union when I saw one of my old girls playin tricks on the corner of 1st ave, so I went over and said 'Yo bitch, wha'choo think you're doin?' and she said some shit about makin bills for her new man, and I said, 'Wha's that? Is Daddy Rick gonna have to choke a bitch?' and her boy came up and POPPED me in the face, so I fed him some curb.

Me:  While we're on the subject of pimps and bitch smackin'. 
Could you imagine if there was a commerical market out there that sold consumer goods directed towards pimps?  Like...  ok, make believe commercial.

-- Two h0's standing on the street corner, a Cadillac pulls up, window rolls down, smoke billows out. --  ""Yo, bitches, got muh money?""  h0's walk to the car, lean into the window.  ""These mu'fu's ain't been actin' right tonight.  All we's got is a C-Note between us.""  Pimp gets out of the car, pulls on a black glove.  ""Bitch, you been actin' up?  You tryin' to steal my money?""  Slaps the hell out of her, with the gloved hand.  Close up on the glove, voice in the background.  ""Pimp Gloves.  When your bitches don't act right, and you gotta smack the taste out of their mouth.  Comes in Junior Player, Li'l G, and Pimp Daddy Deluxe.  Sold at Target."""

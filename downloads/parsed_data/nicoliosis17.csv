"event","So, I had applied a few weeks back for a position that I did not end up getting.  In retrospect, this was a wonderful thing if not a bit disappointing at the time.  Last week my manager pulled me into his office to tell me that CJ Media (a division of Commission Junction) had called him to ask if he could recommend anyone for the Media Development Coordinator position that was available.  My manager proceeded to tell me that Drew (the director of CJ Media) wanted to set up a lunch interview with me and his team later that week.  I told my manager that I would love to meet the team at which point my manager told me that he'd let Drew know.

That night I took a look at the job description and really couldn't see why they wanted to meet with me because I really didn't seem to be qualified for the position.  It seemed really technical.  Don't get me wrong, I know more than most people in our company about how affiliate marketing works and how our system works, but this was still a crazy awesome position.

The day of the interview, we decided on a great little restaurant and I met up with three of the team members.  We chatted, interviewed some and just had a fun time.  I felt like the meeting went really well but wasn't sure that I had landed the job.  Once back, I thank everyone for taking the time to meet with me and headed back to my desk.  

About an hour later Drew (the director) asked me to come meet with him. I headed down and Drew talked about how I know so much about out clients, the system and affiliate marketing and how he thought that I would pick up the position really quickly.  About 20 minutes into the meeting he said, ""So, I really like you and would like you to join our team.  I need to know if this is something that you are interested in rather quickly.... as in, right now.""

O_o  Of course I said yes!  Drew is going to be an awesome boss.  He basically told me that I could work any hours that worked for me and could work from home from time to time as well.  He also said that this position will lead to many great opportunities and that I will go far.  Pretty cool stuff to hear.

Today I got the official offer and they offered me an 8% raise which is pretty good so I'm excited.  He also said that I'd have a review for a possible increase in 6 months.  :)  My first day is Aug. 1st.  I could go on and on about what a cool boss he is and all that he explained but it would take forever.

Long story short, my hard work has paid off!!!  Yay!!"

"event","It feels like it's been forever since I last wrote in here.  It's been crazy busy lately with bagpipe band competitions, visits with family and our engagement party.

I guess that's where I'll start.  My mom came out to California for the weekend of our engagement party.  On that Friday night David and I took my mom to Aloha Steak House (where we got engaged).  It was a good time and the waitress that served us the night that David popped the question was working and yelled, ""Are you married yet?!"" when we came in.  It made us all smile.  I'm really amazed at how excited my mom is about all of this.  She LOVES David.  And she's never really liked any of the people that I have dated.  So, that makes me extremely happy.

The next day, my mom and I went to Camarillo Bridal where I got to try on bridal gowns.  :)  Here are a few links to some of my favorites:

This dress comes in a dusty rose color that is unexpected and stunning with my skin tone and hair.  It's princess-y too.  :) 

http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?line=m&pageSize=64&page=4&style=S8101 

This one looks so old Hollywood Glamour on.  And it's amazing in person because of all of the details on it.

http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?line=m&pageSize=64&page=3&style=A3112LT

And this one is very beachy and feminine.  I'm not sure how I feel about this one yet because it's amazing on and feels great, but it's a little less formal. 

http://www.thewhitedressbytheshore.com/MSfern.htm 

Anyway, so we had fun with that.  After that we picked up the cake and cake slices that David's mom ordered for the engagement party and headed on over.  Everyone had a ton of fun and got along great.  All in all, it was fun and easy going.  The weekend was wonderful, I only wish that my mom and I had gotten to spend a bit more time together.

Let see, after that David and I had a competition with the pipe band Memorial day weekend in Costa Mesa.  We did better than we expected in the competition which was a pleasant surprise.  We ended up staying in Costa Mesa an extra day so that we could check out Yachts for our wedding.  We ended up finding the most amazing Yacht for our ceremony and reception.  It has three floors that are accessible by stairs or an elevator which is amazing.  The top floor is all windows and is where our ceremony will be.  The Yacht cruises around the Newport Beach Harbor and out wedding will happen right at sunset.  :)  How romantic.

The first floor is the formal dining room along with a grand piano and full bar.  Each table has a full ocean view and the room is extremely spacious.  The second floor is where all of the action will be.  :)  It's a 1000 sq foot dance floor, another bar and about 25 white leather couches with coffee tables for lounging.  It doesn't get any better than that!  Not to mention the huge outdoor patio on the top of the Yacht and on the second floor.

There's also a bridal suite for getting ready with a full shower, chaise lounge and many, many mirrors.  To say the least, we'll be living it up in style for our wedding and we are looking to throw a party that no one will forget.  <3

If you're interested, here's a link to the boat:

So, we ended up putting our deposit down this week!  And the ever better part of all of this is that everything is included:  food, DJ, most of the flowers, wedding coordinator, linens, clean up and set up and the cake.  Pretty sweet.

I also asked my mom to make my dress so anything I find that I like my mom and I can tweak to make it perfect.  I'm going out to Colorado in July to do some heavy duty planning and visiting.  I really wish that my mom lived closer.  It's things like this that we have so much fun with.

In other news, I interviewed for my companies Marketing Coordinator position last week and I should be hearing back on whether or not I got the position.  :)  More on that later...

I really should get back to work.  I just wanted to post an update on life before I get wrapped up in something else!

Love you all!"

"event","I got my MRI results and I do not have a brain tumor.  This is awesome news.

My doctor has diagnosed me with something called Meniere's disease.  This is basically a degenerative hearing disease that effects the inner ear.  There are a few fluid filled areas in the inner ear which is very close to the brain.  Sometimes these fluid filled areas swell and the fluids mix causing vertigo, tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and nerve damange which causes hearing loss.  There is currently no cure or treatment for the disease.  Luckly it is not a fatal disease and the symptoms usually fluctuate.  Over time my hearing will lessen in the lower and middle ranges but it's gradual.  Right now, it's mainly my left ear that is affected although 50% of people with this disease develope symptoms in thier second ear.  I feel as if the same symptoms are starting to affect my right ear and have another hearing test scheduled for this next week.  There are other underlying health problems that could be causing the disease so I have to be checked for all of those as well.  As for right now, I'm fine with the diagnosis.  It sucks but it's not life threatening so I cannot complain.  David has jokingly said that we sould begin learning sign language.  Luckliy total deafness is not often a symptom of Meniere's but it may not be a bad idea.  This has all been heavey news and I don't fully understand the effects that this will have on my life but for right now it's just annoying rather than deabilitating.  I'm just glad that it's not a brain tumor.  I'm very lucky in that sense.  There's still so much to learn about this and it's been an overwhelming last few days and I'm going to stay positive about all of this.

For those of you that have expressed concern and who have been supportive of me durning the last week, I can't thank you enough.  My friends and family have made all of this information much easier for me to take.  David, you have been my knight in shining armor and I know that this has probably been harder on your than it has on me.  Ryan, thank you for your concern. You are a dear friend.  I'm doing alright and I'll still be able to sing, listen to music and dance.  And no matter what happens to my hearing, I will always be able to dance.

I'm keeping my chin up.  I think that it will take a lot more to slow me down than this.  This is just a small bump in the road and I'll learn to deal with it one day at a time."

"event","About two years ago I went to my doctor to have my ankles looked at. He made the suggestion that I have a chest x-ray to rule out a heart condition (which often causes ankle swelling like I have). I had the x-ray and later received a letter stating that I had some questionable swelling in the lymph nodes near my heart and that I should have a CT Scan for a closer look. I dismissed the note and forgot about it.

I went to see my doctor about 3 weeks ago for an ear infection when he reminded me of the notice that he had sent me 2 years back and requested that I have another chest x-ray to rule out a rare disease called sarcoidosis. My x-ray results came back and my doctor suggested that I have a CT Scan as the x-rays remain unchanged which means that I do have sarcoidosis. I am scheduled for a CT Scan tomorrow to find out the extent of the disease.
Sarcoidosis is basically a disease that causes grandulonas (clumps of cells) to form in the body. In sacoidosis these grandulomas can form on organs which can cause complications. The disease can be asymptomatic (which means that there are no symptoms) or it can be severe requiring organ transplants or result in complications. Only about 11 people in 100,000 have this disease so it's rather hard to say how it will or won't progress in me. It's usually discovered in individuals between the age of 20-29 by accident. Most doctors don't think to check for it because it is so rare. I'm just lucky that my doctor thought to check me for it. Hopefully the CT Scan will shed some light on where this is taking me but my doctor feels that my condition is stable and not something to concern myself with. It's something that I do need to be aware of though, to make sure that it anything does change that I have it checked out.

David has been very supportive of me. I can tell that he's worried but trying his best to look past the possible complications to be strong for me. He's the sweetest and I'm glad that I have him to share my fears and insecurities with. He's been taking me to my doctor appointments and wiping my tears when I get scared. I couldn't do this without him. He's my angel and I'm lucky to have such a great guy in my life. I only hope that when he needs me, I'll be a good to him as he's been to me.

So, keep me in your prayers and when I know more, I'll update to let you all know."

Ok, now I think that's it.

Tonight is the first SHP meeting of the quarter and we get to start planning for Jekyll and Hyde.  I'm not all that excited about this show, but I think that this is mainly due to the fact that this is Sarah and Elle's last show.  :(  And this makes me very sad as the directorial team that we currently have is phenomenal and should not be broken up.  *sigh*  Damn college kids.  I should move on so that I don't have to be so sad about the end of such eras.  I hate saying goodbye.

Anyway, moving right along, I've been recruited as the bass drummer in David's bagpipe band.  Now, I want you all to note that I have never played the drums and am in fact a dancer.  So, why did they ask me?  Simply because they couldn't find anyone else and need a base drummer in order to compete in upcoming competitions...  Mainly the one in February at the Queen Mary.  God, I hope they know what they've gotten themselves into and I hope that I don't let anyone down.  So, my first rehearsal for that is on Monday.  I'm a bit apprehensive about this, but I usually am with new things.  I'm hoping that I decide that I really enjoy it.

Other than that, Christmas was pretty good.  I got to see my mom and her husband (aka Papa Russ) and Russ' nieces (who are comparable to wild banshees).  Nonetheless, it was nice to see my mom.  David gave me the perfect gift.  He got me a stand up jewelry armoire that has a floor length mirror and allows me to see all of my shinnies!  :)  

Anywho, that's all I can think of right now...  just wanted to let you all know that I'm not dead!  <3

P.S. My new job is great!!!"

Don't know how much time has passed. 
Oh, God it feels like forever. 
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head.

How do you feel? That is the question. 
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer. 
When something like a soul becomes initialized 
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes 
You can't expect a bit of hope. 
So while you're outside looking in 
Describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me. 

How much is real? 
So much to question.
An epidemic of the mannequins 
Contaminating everything 
We thought came from the heart 
But never did right from the start. 
Just listen to the noises, 
Null and void instead of voices.
Before you tell yourself 
It's just a different scene 
Remember it's just different from what you've seen.

I'm looking at you through the glass 
Don't know how much time has passed

The stars that shine for you.

"event","Life has gotten so busy that I feel like I never have a chance to update.  I guess that there isn't too much going on that has changed, but I certainly feel like the pace of my life has picked up.  I think that this is mostly due to the fact that I commute an hour to and from work daily, started a new job that is challenging and that it is nearing tech week for the show.  I'm pretty excited with the show.  From what I have seen, it seems to be going well and I think that this may be some of the best choreography that I have done.  I'm not sure why I feel like it's the best, but people have been telling me that it is, so I will take their word for it.

Anywho, last night I picked up fabric to make the 10 dresses for ""Take Back Your Mink"" and fabric for their ""mink"" shawls as well.  If all goes well, the girls will look great.  Now, I just need to figure out how to make the dresses.  At least this time, I bought fabric that I know will work with my sewing machine (read: NOT sequin dot fabric).

In other news, I feel like I am starting to get a grasp on my new job.  The internet advertising industry (or Affiliate Marketing) is very technical and complex.  This makes for a steep learning curve that I am having a blast with.  the first few weeks were rather stressful, however, I think that I have managed to retain quite a bit of info.  Even David (who works for the same company) says that I now know more about our business model than he does.  This is largely due to the fact that I am in client support helping publishers and advertisers troubleshoot their advertising links and such, and David is programming the tools.  Pretty cool stuff.  I love knowing that there are so many avenues available to me.

Oh!  I have been rhinestoning my computer and am quite excited about it.  If you've ever seen my phone... imagine that.... only in fuchsia and on my laptop.  Pretty awesome (although impractical).  I thoroughly enjoy it.

I'm heading to Tuscan for Christmas.  Other than that, I can't think of anything else... Oh!  I love David.

That's all!  More later!"

Not only is the pay here so much better, but the people are all really driven and super intelligent.  I also heard through the grapevine that another SB Travel employee resigned just two weeks after I did.  They must really be hurting.

In other news, I got my new lap top and I have decided that I am going to rhinestone the whole lid.  :)  Yes, I know.  It has no practical application, but it makes me happy.  As David says, ""If it's small, shiney or has a bow on it, Nicole will like it.""  This is true, although, I think that David has decided to reorder the list to shiney, small or has a bow on it.

Other then that, there isn't too much new going on here.  The show is going great and I finally feel like I've managed to pump out some good choreography.  Everyone is great, the cast is fantastic and all of the directors seem to getting along quite well.

It's pretty amazing how much things can change in just a few years.  I remember when I was hired as a receptionist at $12.50 an hour and was so excited to be making so much money.  Two years later and $4 more and hour, I am leaving for better pay.  This company has taugh me a lot and I wish that I could say that they treated me well.  I won't miss the industry.

Current mood:  ecstatic 

I haven't much time, but I just had to say that Monday and Tuesday night's Dave Matthews Band concerts were AMAZING!!!! He played 27, Grey Street, Ants Marching, Tripping Billies, Two Step, Cornbread, Shotgun, Crash and many many more.

But the even better part of the evening? He had a few freinds join him for a few songs. The Marley Brothers came out for a song and sang ""Exodus"".

But the best treat ever? John Mayer came out, confessed that he would not be who he is today had it not been for the Dave Matthews Band and then he played electric guitar and sang 41 with the band!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Eeeeeeee!!!!!!!!! It was an awesome night.

Long story short, BEST DMB CONCERT I'VE EVER BEEN TO! And I'm praying that they'll make it a live album. How cool would that be, DMB Live at the Hollywood Bowl.... I'll keep my fingers crossed! 

Off I go, today is a big day! Guys and Dolls audtions are tonight and I can't wait.

Also, finished interviewing for a new job yesterday and feel great about how it went.  I'll find out in a week and a half if I got the job or not!!!

And last, but not least, today is David's and my 6 month anniversary!!!  I love you, Babe!  You're the best and I'm beyond excited to venture through life with you.  *kiss*"

"event","It's been way too long since I lasted posted anything and there are so many things going on right now.

Backing up to a week ago, David and I went to the Ojai Pirate Fair on both Saturday and Sunday of last week.  He's a snare drummer in a bagpipe band and they perform at this event every year.  I've never been to anything quite like the Pirate Faire before, but I managed to put together a piratesque costume and ended up having a blast.  I met the midget and the really tall black man from Pirates of the Caribbean, some of the costume/tech/makeup people who worked on the movies as well, and saw quite a few interesting people.  All in all, it was a great weekend.  :)  Not to mention that David looks super cute in his kilt and pirate gear.

Friday night David and I drove up to Sacramento for my uncles wedding.  The 6 hour drive wasn't too bad for me (although I'm sure that David might beg to differ as I played and sang along to Aida for 2 hours).  Saturday morning my Mom, Russ, David and I headed up to Apple Hill.  When I was young I used to live in Camino aka Apple Hill for about 6 years.  It's a quaint little area in the mountains between Sactown and Tahoe.  We drove down our old road, past my elementry school and through town.  Later we headed to High Hill Ranch for some apple pie and apple wine.  We headed back to Sacramento at about 2pm to get ready for my uncles wedding.

The wedding was very pleasant and in a very pretty location.  There was a lake behind the outside alter, a pretty grassy hill and tons of flora.  The ceremony was short and sweet.  After the wedding we went inside for a buffet dinner.  I sang for everyone (per my uncle's request) right before the cake cutting.  May I just say, I love my family dearly, but I am BEYOND happy that I never have to sing at another wedding...  In fact, I'm tempted to have my entire family sing ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" for my wedding just because I'd find it highly ammusing.  Anyway, as usual I burst into tears (because I get super emotional at weddings) and didn't get control of myself until about 1/4 of the way though the song.  After that, there was cake, a champagne toast and coffee.  It was pleasant and I was glad to have the family finally get to meet David.  Everyone enjoyed having him around and I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptionally warm reception that my family gave him.  I think that they all know that he'll be around for a long, long time.  :)

Anyway, in other news, I'm off to see the Dave Matthews Band at the Hollywood Bowl with David tonight and tomorrow night.  :)  David had purchased these concernt tickets the 2nd week that we were together and we knew that we'd still be together when it rolled around... and here we are!!!  What more could I ask?!  I've got my two favorite Daves in the same place!!!

I'm also looking forward to starting the shows up once again!  Auditions are this Friday and Saturday and (as usual) I have yet to decide what I'll teach for the audition number.  All I know is that this show will be 10 times easier than the last and just as much of a blast.  :)  I'm so ready to be teaching again.

Friday is David and my 6 month anniversary!!!  But due to my forgetfulness, we'll not get to celebrate until Sunday.  Oh well.  I'm happy.  :)  It feels like we've been together for so much longer than 6 months and I can't wait for the years and years to come.  

Oh, and I got another raise/promotion and I've got an interview for another job.  Oh, and I've been asked to model for a brooks student and I'm stoked about that, too.  More on all of that later.

Well, that's all (and by that's all I mean, 'I've regurgitated WAY too much information and should really stop typing now')."

David's bagpipe band plays there every year and I'll be tagging along for some sight-seeing and some possible beer.  Be you intaaaarrrrested let me know.  Perhaps you could catch a ride with David and me.  :)

The next weekend is my uncles wedding which I should be a lot more excited for than I am.  This is mostly because my family members all isist that I sing at their weddings.  I can't stand doing this.  Partly because this means that I have to learn songs that I don't like, I have to stress about getting them right instead of enjoying the event, I'm extreemly emotional at weddings, and (lastly) I feel like a performing monkey...  cymbals and all.  Anyway, other than that, I'm sure that it'll me a nice weekend and David gets to meet my family.  :)  I'm really excited for that.

The weekend after that, all hell breaks loose.  A.K.A. Shrunken Head Productions is holding auditions for ""Guys and Dolls.""  I'm super excited for this show and it should be a lot of fun and the show is really cute.  Not to mention that the costumes are super cool.  So, after auditions, my life is going to be consumed by the show.  :)

That's about all here.  I'd really like a new job, but haven't taken the time to really find a new one, so I'm stuck in the travel industry for now.  I'm sure that I'll have some interesting news in a the next couple of days."

Current mood:  excited 


I'm getting excited for my trip to Hawaii!!!  Friday the whole company is heading to the airport at about 3pm or so for celebratory beers and to catch our flight to Honolulu.  :)  We arrive into Honolulu Friday night at about 9:30pm and head to our beautiful resort (The Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort).  My plan is to book it to the beach for a late night swim in the ocean.= and then head to bed.

The next morning, the entire company has a site inspection of Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort followed by breakfast.  After that, I have the whole afternoon off until the 5:30 pm site inspection of the Kahala Resort.  After this, the resort is hosting a dinner for our company at the Plumeria Beach House.  Mmmm.....  After that, who knows... perhaps a night of dancing?

The next morning there is another company breakfast at our resort and then free time all day until our company hosted dinner that evening at 7:30pm.  The fantastic thing about the company dinner is that they always take us to some 5 star restuarant and let us order what ever we want.  Drinks, appetizers, steak, fish, more drinks, desert and coffee.  Mmmmm....

As for my free time, I would really like to go snorkeling, body surfing, shopping and perhaps visit my aunts company for a swim with the dolphins.  <3  Should be a blast!

There is a sad side as well.  I know that this may sound terribly sappy and pathetic, but I'm really goingto miss David.  Since we stared dating almost 6 months ago, the longest that we've spent apart is 24 hours.  I'm thankful that he's going to be in SF this weekend with his band.  That way I won't feel so bad.  He's the best.  Then, come Sept 8th I'll be moving into Casa de Ron!  :)  Yay!!!!!  It should be fantastic!  Things couldn't be better!  Well, perhaps they could...  If I get that job that I've been hoping for life would be perfect.

Anywho, if any of you have any requests of things to pick up while I'm in Hawaii, let me know!  Aloha!"

"event","Yesterday was beyond bizzare.  Perhaps it's because I had to drive myself into work or perhaps someone was just playing one bizzare and evil trick on Santa Barbara Travel.  Everything was going on as usual until about 10:30am when all of the power on our entire block went out.  After about 10 minutes of no power (and no work because everything that we do is through the computer) these two foreign exchange students come in and walk over to my desk.  The girl starts rambling on and on about how she wants to go to Canada or something and I say, ""I would love you assist you, however, the power is out and I can't check any airline tickets for you at this time.""  So the guy chimes in and says, ""When can you check the prices for us?""  I say, ""As soon as the power is back on.""  He says, ""well, when's that goingto be?""  So, I replyed, ""They're estimating between 4-6 hours.  You can come back tomorrow if you'd like or you can try us later in the day.""  He said, ""Well, if you aren't going to help us....  We just want to know when we can get a quote.""  O_o  I had just told him what the deal was.... sheeesh.

Eventually those two took off and we were still without power.  There was a full staff of us just sitting around waiting for the power.  About that time, this old hag and her husband burst into our office.  The woman starts hurrying (and by hurrying I mean shuffling quite slowly) towards the back of our office.  People aren't allowed past the frount desks in our offices, as with most businesses.  So I say, ""May I help you ma'am?""  And she says, ""I need to use your restroom.""  So I reply, ""I'm sorry ma'am, but we don't have a public restroom.  You'll have to use the one over at Kinkos, next door.""  She says (still moving towards the back of our office), ""Kinkos is closed and I need to pee.""  I say, ""I'm sorry ma'am.  You cannot go back there.  It's for employees only.  We have credit card info, the safe and other thing that we cannot have you around.""  At this point she turns to me and screams, ""Well, then I'll just yank my pants down and pee on your floor!  I have to go and you all are shitheads... so I'll just piss all over your floor!""  And she proceeds to begin pulling her pants down.  About this time, my manager comes storming out of her office yelling, ""Ma'am!  You do NOT yell at my employees!""  And her and this woman just start flinging verbal insults at each other.  Finally my manager says, ""Just go use the restroom and get out of my office.  You are never to come back here again.""  Meanwhile the poor husband is just standing there mortified.  The woman did her thing and then my manager escorted her out the back door yelling, ""You don't ever come back here.  You're an extreemly rude woman.""  It was insane.  The hag was seriously about to pee all over the floor.  I was going to let her do it and then called the cops to have her dragged out of here.  Ahhh, the joys of working on State Street.

After that, I took lunch and talked to David while sitting in my car.  He was explaining the joys of jury duty to me.  Once back in the office, I had an email from a woman named Marie.  I had turned in my application to Commission Junction (the company that David works for) a few months back.  I'd pretty much given up, when I get a message saying that they were interested in interviewing me for the Client Support Representative possition.  Long story short, I have a phone interview on Friday.  The company is fantastic with tons of room for growth and I'd be working in the same place as my baby.  :)  Could it get any better?  So, we'll see how that goes.  If I do get the job, David gets a $1500 check for recommending me.  Pretty cool!

Oh, and to top off the most bizzare Monday, two of my coworkers hard drives crashed, another fire was started just north of here and my manager has a flat tire...  To say the least, walking into work this morning was a little nerve racking.  But thus far, everything seems to be going alright.  (knock on wood).

Other than that, life is fantastic.  I have no complaints.  I'm just counting the days until Hawaii and my move.  :)  Life is good."

I think that this is due to the fact that I have been overwhelmingly happy and relatively stress free these last few weeks.  David and I are doing fantastic.  We finished painting our room a few weeks ago and it looks amazing.  We have this awesome deep blue, burnt velvet bedding from Z Gallerie that looks a little moroccan.  And we painted the walls a medium blue and really deep navy blue.  It looks great and feels very relaxing.  On top of that, I'm super excited for my move down to Camarillo.  Every weekend that we spend at the Casa de Ron as we call it, makes me more and more excited.  I've become so domesticated all of a sudden.  I've even developed an interest in gardening!  O_o

In other news, my company just announced yesterday that we are going to Oahu over Labor Day weekend!!!  Yay!!!  My air was ticketed Monday and I will be getting to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village.  If you want to drool a little you can check it out here:  http://www.hiltonfamilyhawaii.com/hilton-hawaii-village.aspx .  To say the least, I'm excited.  I've been needing a vacation and a reason to stick with this grueling profession.

SHP is getting ready for the next show and I'm excited.  It'll be nice to get back into the swing of things.  I've also heard that Ryan is planning on continueing SHP after this year and that there is a pretty amazing person interested in becoming director.  I've been saying that this is my last year with SHP and that I need a break and blah, blah, blah...  but who knows, if they'll have me perhaps I'll stick around.  David really hopes that I will as he's developed a great appriciation for the shows.  :)  Makes me happy.  But if not, perhaps I'll audition for some musical theater groups near Camarillo and perform for a change.  Who knows...  All I know is that I will need some sort of distraction and it better damn well be theater!

So the upcoming weeks are busy, but I'm excited about it all.  Hawaii, the move, Anna's birthday, my Uncle's wedding, Dave Matthews Band, the Pirate Fair...  and starting back up for another fun-filled year with SHP.  I can't wait!!!"

Normally this wouldn't be such a terrible thing, but there are a few aspects of this situation that complicate things.  A couple of years ago, my Mom and Russ decided to buy a house together.  This is the first house that my mom had ever owned and knowing this fact helps me to know that she's become very attached to the place.  My mom's work also just put her through two years of school so that she could earn her BA in business and she finally got the promotion that she's been working so hard to get.  Only, now she's had to think of leaving her job, taking on thousands of dollars worth of debt and selling the house that she and Russ just bought.  Well, My mom and Russ have been sitting on this topic for sometime and neither of them wanted to put their foot down to say, ""This is what we should do,"" and the time frame of the move is growing smaller.  I recieved an email this morning that broke my heart.  In short it said that after a lot of discussion Russ has decided that he is moving back to Sacramento in September and my Mom is staying in Colorado at least until March of next year.  They haven't even been married for a year and this all gets thrown at them.  The situation is terrible and I know that it is crushing them both.  My Mom's saddness is palpable as I am sure that Russ' is as well.  It crushes me.  My Mom has had such a rough life and about the time that she got married she said to me, ""I finally feel like things are goin my way.  I finally feel as if I get to do what I want to go.""  She works so hard and yet life never seems to give her the break that she is looking for.  Russ means the world to her and now they'll be spending a good part of the next year apart.  And on top of all of this, they have to sell their house and both of them will be moving into one bedroom appartments.  I wish so badly that I could give her a huge hug and let her talk about all of her fears and dissapointments.  It saddens me that I cannot be.  Oh well, I guess...  such is life."

"event","My life is fantastic!!!  :)  I have the best Man, am moving into a fantastic house (that said amazing man owns), am looking for a new job (possibly in the jewelery business) and am happier than ever.  Not to mention I have found the perfect peice of jewelery.  :)  I just want it to be September so that I can move in with David.  He's such an amazing guy!!!

This weekend, David and I started to remove the wallpaper in his room in preperation for new paint.  We've picked out the most amazing bedding (this really awesome burnt velvet duvet in a rich navy blue color) and are going to paint the walls in a medium grey blue.  Just getting peices of the terrible floral stripped wall paper is making to room look so much larger, I can only imagine how awesome it'll look with fresh blue paint!!!  Our room is going to be so amazing!!!!!!!  :)  After we finish that, I plan to work on the living room.  Daivd really wants an ""Indiana Jones"" feel to his living room so I told him that when he's ready I'll paint it whatever he wants.  I love moving into new places and I love decorating so this is gonna be a blast.  :)  To date, I've moved a total of 7 times since I first moved to Santa Barbara 5 years ago.  Crazy.  Now, I'll actually get to settle down for a while.  Or, at least for the next few years.  Hopefully, one day, we'll pack up and move some place outside of California... like Seattle or Denver.  But, until then, Camarillo is slowly becoming my new home.  I'm excited.  My life is beginning to settle into what I had dreamed that it would be.  :)"

"event","I remember thinking that I was going to be bored after 42nd Street ended due to a lack of things to do.  Turns out that this is not the case.  Between David's band/social obligations and my social calender, we've managed to stay more than busy.  Since 42nd Street ended, neither of us has had a weekend in which we had nothing planned.  July looked as if it were going to remain rather uneventful, but day by day seems to be getting more and more full.  August doesn't seem to have too much going on and September and October are already pretty booked up.  O_o  This doesn't even include the SHP rehersal schedule/auditions/shows/whatever else.  I enjoy having things to do, and David and I make the best of everything, but I'm hoping that there might be a weekend or two over the next 3 months that doesn't have much planned.  :)

My work just made an unofficial announcement that the whole company is going to Hawaii again.  As it stands, we are not going to Maui again (which is good, as it's an island I have already seen.)  However, I am not so certain that I will still be with the company.  I am growing tired of being misstreated in the work place and being taken advantage of and not paid accordingly.  I'm not sure if I stated it before, but, two weeks ago my manager pulled me aside and informed me that I would be getting a pay raise of $1.50 per hour.  Pretty awesome!  That is, until the same manager pulled me aside last Friday to inform me that she had made a mistake and I would only be getting a $.50 per hour raise.  That's a whopping $50 a month after taxes.  Bleh.  Long story short, I don't really have respect for the way that the company is being run.  I'm currently revamping my resume and have a list a mile long of places that I'm looking to apply.  Wish me luck!

Oh!  And I can't wait to move in with David come the middle of September.  I feel like once the move is complete, my life will feel a little bit more settled.  If I could move in this weekend, I would.  But, alas, I have a lease.  Only two and a half more months!  Eeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","I have decided that it is now time to begin looking for another job.  The one that I am currently in is not a career path that I would like to follow.  I haven't really taken the time to figure out what I think I would like to do instead...  I do know, that I would like to take a few classes at a community college in the near future to perhaps work towards getting a degree in sports medicine.  I've always been interested in becoming a physical therapist and now might be the time to begin looking into doing that.  Having been through more physical therapy than most 60 year olds, I know what it's like, I know how it feels to be injured and working towards recovery and I'm good with people.  Who knows, perhaps I could become a physical therapist for a dance company or an athletic team.  It's be pretty cool.  Anyway, I'm just trying to rack my brain to see what I might be interested in.  More on that later.  I'm not so sure that I will looking into classes until I've moved and have settled into another job...  Then I just have to figure out if I'll be working in Camarillo or in Santa Barbara.  Bleh......  Thank God David is around to keep my head on straight.  Where would I be without that boy?  :)  Well, keep your fingers crossed for me and if you have any suggestions on places to work, I would be more than willing to consider them."

"event","Last night was the open dress rehearsal for 42nd Street, and although there were a few hitches, it went amazingly well!!!!  We've never put on such a great show.  The cast is a blast, the acting is brilliant, and my dancers are better than I ever could have asked for.  On top of all of this, the band sounds fantastic thanks to a fantastic musical director (and of course my superb boyfriend!)  I must say, I've never had a boyfriend who worked so hard to help out with any performance that I've been in or helped to put on.  David's been to nearly every rehearsal (even though he didn't have to), helped me learned my lines and knows the songs from the show better than I do.  :) :) :)  Soooo, much better than fighting someone just to help me for one night.  Just one more reason I know this guy's a keeper.  No one understands me quite liek he does, picks me up when I'm not capable of picking myself up and puts me in my place when I'm being a little brat.  He's the One!!!  My one and only!!!  I could go on and on about how great he is to/for me but I'd rather not make you lose your lunch.  Anyway, I must say that it's nice to look back at the past 2 months of journals and see that I have been overwhelmingly happy.  No moredeep depressions, ""I Hate You"" journals, or ""How much more can I take?"" questions.  Life's as it should be, and will be from hear on out.  This is what happens when two hopeless romantics fall in love...  there's hope!"

"event","Yesterday:  Got through 3 minutes of intense tap choreography and still have about 40 seconds to go (about 30 minutes to an hour of work).  That's not to say that I am done as I still need to finish ""Young and Healthy"" and act II scene 6 ""blocking"".  It went quite well, and the cast is learning so fantastically quick.  :)  I have a little bit of frustration, but I believe that now is not the time to address it.  (If ever, as my frustrations with the show usually just piss people off).  Lesson learned: Scale back on how involved in the shows I am from here on out, or find a replacement and be done with them all together.  If it weren't for the cast, I'd have given up by now as I feel that I am in way to deep and not really getting any slck for how much work I've taken on this show.  But, enough complaining as it's never really directed at where it belongs, and therefore, is inconsequential.

Tonight:  Relax with David.  Go over my lines and perhaps pull together all of the costume pieces for the show.  Perhaps not...  who knows.  We'll just play it by ear.

Tomorrow:  Finish 42nd Street number and clean all of the other dance numbers that we've got finished.

Friday:  Head down to the House of Ron.  :)

This is the calm before the storm.  I'm hoping that the next week won't be all that bad as the cast is doing well.  Now I just need to catch myself up to speed and get all of my songs, lines and dances memorized.  Bleh....

Oh, and I love David!!!  Best boyfriend I could ever ask for.  Not to mention, he's a FANTASTIC drummer and will definitly help to hold our tapping together.  <swoon>"

"event","It's not quite tech week yet, but the mayhem begins.  Tonight I have to finish 4 minutes of intense tap choreography for the closing (and best known) number of the show.  Blehhh......  I get really overwhelmed by all of this, even though, I'm doing rather well for a little time as I have had to do all of this choreography in.  This is the most intense show that I have worked on. It has even more choreo than JC Superstar... although the cast is much more focused and therefore much easier to work with.  I have very little wiggle room this quarter on getting things done and now I am feeling the presure.  For the next show, I think that I'll ask to have choreo time scheduled so that it doesn't get this crazy again.  Thank God for the 4 months that I get off this Summer.  I think that it is much needed.  Anyway, besides finishing the finale of the show, I have to go over all of my lines and songs to make sure that they are stage ready (right now that is definitly NOT the case.)  Then Saturday begins tech week....  gah......  I'm actually thinking that it's not going to be all that bad.  The cast is on top of everything, the songs sound decent, all of the blocking is done and there are just a few small scenes here and there that need choreo work.  Should be rather smooth.  Well, at least I have tomorrow and Friday to relax before the storm hits!  After Saturday, there's no stopping me until Sunday morning!!!  Thank God David's in the show or I'd have to deal with severe David withdrawls.  In the past 2 months, there have only been about 3-4 nights that we haven't spent together... crazy.  We are crazy, and I love it!"

His Mom, Dad, Brother, Brother's girlfriend and Half sister are all going.  They told me that I had to go, and that I was a part of their family and wanted to have me along.  SOOO  SWEET!!!  They offered to pay, so in return, I decided to book the cruise for them.  I'm more than excited!  Not only is this my first cruise and my first time out of the counrty, but I get to go with 6 other amazing people (one of whom is my lover).  AWESOME!!!

"event","I am a very emotional person who tends to dwell on my past until I completely understand what has happened.  Some issues take years to resolve, others a matter of moments.  Today I was looking through my email account and deleting messages that I no longer need and ran across emails from J.  At first, it made me sad, but a split second later I realized how much happier I am now, how little stress there is in my life and how I finally have someone who truely understands, listens and appriciates who I am.  All of the feelings of sadness and failure that I felt for J. melted away and left me thinking that this all needed to happen to get me where I am today.  To a place where I can truely appriciate being understood and loved.  It's taken me nearly a month to step back from the mess that J. left behind him and take it for what it is.  A learning experience.  I'm not one to regret, as I feel we all learn something from any given experience.  My life has been a string of events that have gotten me to where I am now.  Had I not dated J, I never would have found out that we'd been cheating on me, which would have prevented me from being hurt, which would have kept me from joining a spacific website, which would have prevented me from meeting David.  In many ways, I own him a thank you for doing what he did, as I would have kept searching and missed my perfect opportunity.  All of the building blocks are starting to fall into place.  I'm sure I sound like a raving lunatic, and there's really only one person who can truely understand what I am saying...  but in laymans terms, I am happier now than I have been my entire life.  Everything just feels right...  even the tough times.  I'm finally content...  oh, and I'm in love.  :)"

"event","This weekend was fantastic.  Here's the break down:

Friday night I drove down to Camarillo to stay with David.  He's the sweetest thing ever.  I'd tell you about the gifts that he gave me, but I think that you would vomit from sweetness.  We now have decided on a song.  Watch out, because next it may be the names of our first born child.  O_o  Just kidding!

Saturday morning, we relaxed.  David purchased us ticket to see both Dave Mathhews concerts at the Hollywood Bowl in October.  :)  I am beyond excited!!!  Not only do I get to see my favorite band, but I also get to go with my favorite boy!  That afternoon I headed back up to Santa Barbara to work on choreography for the show and to clean up for the party that night.  I headed to rehearsal that evening which went really well.  I'm impressed with how well the cast is picking everything up.  There is soooooo much to teach, but I have faith that they're willing to work hard to make this a fantastic show.

Saturday night was the party at our house.  David showed up at about 8:30pm or so, shortly followed by Tee his roommate.  Later on, Jeremy Weiner, Paj, Whitney and her new boy Chris showed up.  I was a little apprehensive that my friends wouldn't click all that well, seeing that they are from various chapters of my life.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised.  David was perfect.  Social, interesting and sweet.  I couldn't have asked for more.  My friend, Paj drove all the way from LA to come to the party.  I haven't seen him in 5 years.  It was pleasant to see him again.  He stayed over and joined me for breakfast the next morning.  It amazes me how after all of these years, he's still the same guy I remember from when I was 12.  Pretty cool.  We promised that we would meet again for the decade is up.


Sunday, David took off to spend the day with his parents and I recovered from the evening before.  I took a brief nap and chatted with David that afternoon.  At about 5:30 Sarah and Elle asked if we could have a directors meeting since another of our cast members dropped.  We get there, and Sarah and Elle drop a bomb on me.  They say that there isn't anyone in our current cast that is capable of playing the roll that is now empty and that we haven't got the time to try to find someone new.  We open in 6 weeks....  So, they want me to play Anytime Annie (who happens to be the supporting lead female).  I say yes, although, I'm quite apprehensive about how much work this isging to be.  Between teaching, choreographing, learning lines and songs, I have no idea when I'll be able to breathe.  I'm flattered that they want me to do it.  I really am, but I need to get over feeling so overwhelmed.  David's offered to help me learn my lines and is going to help out with tech stuff as well.  He keeps saying, ""I just want to be involved in the things you care about.  It's important to me.""  <melt>  How could I NOT love him!!!

Anyway,  there are amillion and a half other things that I want to write about but not nearly enough time.  Lifes great, even though I am burried with the show.  OH, and I'm moving in October.  More about that later.  :)

It's fantasic.  I sould like a lunatic, feel spectacular and can't think straight.  I love every minute of it.  I've dated quite a few people, made a lot of mistakes and have scars so deep that I never thought they'd go away...  All of my fears are gone, he knows what I'm thinking and feeling and calls me out when he knows I'm shetlering myself.  I have no reasons to be afraid and it's the coolest thing I've ever experienced.

"event","I had my date with David this weekend and I can honestly say that I have never connected that well with anyone else on a first date.  He was the perfect gentleman I had hoped he would be.  We walked around the Camarillo outlet mall for a little while, went and saw a movie and then when to his place and just talked until 2am.  Had today not been Easter I'm sure that we would have chatted until much later.  I've never really met a guy that was just like me before.  Everything that he said I completely understood and vice versa.  It was so sweet.  He kept saying, ""I really like you.""  And at one point he said, ""Can I just keep you?""  Funny thing is, I know what he ment.    I had no intentions of getting involved with anyone for a while, but I'm quite certain that this is going to be the start of a great thing.  We're both incredibly empathetic, emotional and still logistical.  It was like having a conversation with myself.  I'm still in shock with all of the things that we talked about.  There are things that I told him that took me years to tell people that I've dated.  He would start telling me a story and say, ""I can't believe that I'm telling you this already...  and I'm comfortable do it too.""  To say the least, I'm very impressed and very excited.  He never tried to make a move, wasn't looking to get into my pants and gave me the sweetest goodnight kiss ever (in the fact that it was totally unexpected and very short and sweet).  In the car back to my house (he was taking me back home) we sang to Dave Matthews and just enjoyed the ride.  It was a perfect date...  I only wish that we didn't have to cut it off.  Oh!  And he even called me this afternoon just to wish me a happy Easter.  <melt><sigh>  Life is good.  I now give you permission to go vomit if you would like.  :)

Meeting someone that you have high hopes for is down right scary.  Anyway, he's awesome.  :)  Lunch was pleasant, he's a sweetie, he loves DMB, he's cute and I felt like we could have talked for a lot longer.

"event","I know it seems like such a short time after getting out of a relationship, but I've got high hopes for a boy that I'm hopeing to meet next week.  Let me just say, he seems to have it all: a great job, he's into the arts, loves music and (best of all) is a HUGE Dave fan.  He knows just as much about the band (if not more) than I do.  He can actually PLAY all but a few of the bands songs on drums (which is quite an accomplishment if you know how crazy Carter Beauford is).  We chatted all day and never seemed to run out of things to say.  Sounds lame, sounds fast, sounds a shit load of things, but let me just say that I'm excited to know more.  He's got a great sense of humor too with is something that I love in a guy.  If he can keep up with my witty comments, love for music and appreciation for the arts, the guy deserves a chance.  :)  Too cool.

In other news, we are holding auditions for 42nd Street tomorrow.  I'm both excited and nervous to  start this show.  I think of all of the shows that we've done, this will be the most challenging for me thus far.  It's entirely tap dance (which is awesome) but crazy hard to teach beginners.  We've talked about holding tap workshops to get all of the cast mates up to speed on the basic steps.  Of all of the styles of dance that I have learned, tap is by far the most difficult.  It's all about rhythm, and if someone doesn't have rhythm, there's really nothing you can do about it.  Not to worry, I'm pretty sure that we can pull it off.  It's a great show with a ton of energy and it holds a special place in my heart.  (I played one of the leads in high school.)

Tomorrow night, before auditions, I am heading to an art show with one of my coworkers.  Should be fun.  I love that I have the free time now to get out and do all of these things that I had previously turned down.  I was missing out on so much.  Oh!  And I won a raffle prize at the event that I went to at Dargans on Thursday.  Pretty sweet!  That's two raffle winnings in the past 6 months.  Speaking of, I still have a free two night stay at the Harbor View to use...  Perhaps for a future romantic getaway?  Let's hope!!!

I love how my life is changing!  Who would have thought that an end could bring about such fantastic things!!!

He's this tall, dark haired, dark eyed guy with an awesome tattoo and a great smile.  Well, a few days ago, I told my coworkers about this small crush that I've had for a year and a helf now and haven't done anything about it.  Today he was parked out front and I said, ""Aw!  There's my cute FedEx guy!""  and, of course all of the ladies in the office HAVE to see who he is.  So Tina says, ""He's cute.  Maybe I'll go ask him if he's single.""  Me: ""No that would be really embarassing.  I'm sure he could figure out who wanted to know.""  Brenda:  ""I'm going to ask him.""  So she marches out, right up to him and asks if he's single.  He says yes and wants to know why she's asking.  She says, ""Well, one of the girls in the office has a crush on you.""  He asks who it is...  and brenda says, ""I dunno... you'll just have to figure it out...""  how I love the ladies I work with, but oh how nervous I am for the next time I have to see him.  They're all excited to see what he does as it is OBVIOUS who's interested.  Sigh....  Even my boss, Mary Jo is interested to see this fella now.  She was joking about tripping him just so that I would be required to help him up.

"event","Friday night all of my fears, concernes and stresses walked out of the house, out of my life and out of California.  After which, my roommates and I went to Dargans to meet up with two of the grad students for a ""sigh or relief"" drink.  Aaron and Devin were so fantastic to be around.  Both funny, intelligent guys.  Arron expressed attraction to me to Anna who then told him, ""You can date her, but then you have to deal with me if you hurt her.""  Aaron was a good sport about it and kept up with his harmless flirting.  By 2am Kevin was ready to go home, even though Anna and I were hardly aware that it was closing time.  Devin invited us back to his place for a few more beers, but we declined as it had been a long week.  Nice guys, I really hope to hang out with them again soon.

Saturday, Anna expressed interest in getting the yard ready for grass seeding.  She was going to wait until Kevin came back to the house, but when I offered, decided that us girls could get the job done.  We spent all afternoon tilling up the yard.  It was hard work, but we were so proud of ourselves.  After showering and such, we went over the the pool at the Doubletree and layed out for about an hour.

Sunday we finished putting down topsoil and grass seed.  Now we olny have to wait 3 weeks for grass!  We're already planning all of the vollyball games and BBQ's that we want to have.  Also, last night our new roommate, Travis, moved in.  He's a really sweet, chill, down-to-Earth guy.  I think that this will be a really great living situation.

I can't tell you how much better I feel already.  The more that I think back at all of the things that happened over the last year between Jeremy and I, the happier I am with him leaving.  I feel bad for him in the fact that he's just made things harder on himself, but not bad enough that it keeps me awake at night.  I only hope that one day he'll figure it all out and be able to admit his faults and fix them as opposed to running from them.  Life can only get better from here!  I'm looking forward to all of my new found freedom and can't explain how much better I feel.  It sucks that it took violence to realize that I didn't want him around anymore, but now that he's gone, I feel like I have the whole World ahead of me.  :)  And I finally have time for all of my friends now!

"event","Living in a house in which 3 dogs and a cat reside, I feel that I can rant about this for a breif moment.  Two of my roommates are the BEST dog owners I have ever met.  In fact, these two are treated better than most childern.  However, there is a third roommate who never does anything for his dog.  Last night it was about 9:30pm and all three dogs were following me around because they were hungry.  The bed pet owner happened to be home, knew that they hadn't been fed yet and wouldn't take the 5 minutes it took to get them their dinner...  so I did it.  Not a big deal.  Half way through feeding them, he comes out scowles at me and walks off.  No, ""Hey, thanks for feeding Bella"" or ""You don't have to do that, let me take over.""  Whatever.  Doesn't bother me all that much...  He's pissed off at all of us right now (since we told him he needs to move) and just keeps to himself.  This isn't what upsets me...  What upsets me is the fact that he's neglecting his dog now as well.  Usually Bella sleeps in his room, but every morning that I've come out of my room she's waiting infront of my door or sleeping on the couch because the bastard has kicked her out of his room now too.  On top of all of this, he's moving all of his stuff either tomorrow or Saturday.  He's renting a truck, piling in all of his crap and packing up his dog... to go to Vegas for a while, and then on to Arkansas to live with his Mom.  He's the kind of guy that would decide to go in somewhere for an hour or two and leave the poor dog in the hot car all afternoon without food, water and a cracked window.  Pisses me off.  Pets are like best friends or children...  perhaps this is why he no longer has either.  The more that I think about it, the more I want to file a police report on this guy (and not for the pet thing).  Seems to me that he doesn't learn unless it's the really hard way. He's been walking around the house, shooting me cocky, dirty looks.  I can't tell you how nice it would be to wipe that attitude off of his face for good.  Well, looks like my rant has gone from bad pet owners to cocky, abusive boyfriends.  Sorry about that.  I think I'll get back to work and write later when I've calmed my mind down a little bit.

"event","OK, dustan and I, have been seeing each other off and on for about a month, I was confused on what he wanted and he was confused on what I thought it was, either a relationship or just friends.  Well I don't really care as long as I'm with him.  He decided just friends for now but friends with benefits so since then we kiss and hang out more but we haven't like fooled around. I want to, so on new years eve...me dustan niki shannon and jason and patric were all gunna go to niki's since her parents are out of town. We talked about it..nothing was ever final until the night before he's like im not going because jason's going out of town and he wont know a lot of people there....I started to get upset since he was like ditching me cause he thought of himself in my opinion that was messed up...well he could tell i was pissed so he called me and texted me until i talked to him..we talked..and he ended up coming..but i ended up drunk as skunk and he wasn't talking to me like i thought he would.  I mean i tried to kiss him, since it was new years eve and you're supposed to kiss, and like he wouldn't cause he said..""Your wasted I dont want to"" and I ended up kissing some other people like 3 other girls and triple kissing with him.  But still I don't know what to say to him either should I call him or should I wait for him to call me, I did talk to him after words like the next day. i called. he didnt pick up but called me back then we finally talked but I was kinda quiet and he was quiet as usual.  I honestly don't know what he thinks of me now.  Or am i just blowing it out of porportion, HHMMMMM"

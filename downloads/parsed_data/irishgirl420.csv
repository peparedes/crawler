"event","Life is carzy.  I was so mad yesterday!  It seemed like Mark was avoiding me- he owes me money, you see. But he ended up calling me and gave me half of what he owes me- he gave me an L tho.  I smoked this mornning- I'm still blazed.  I have concluded to tell Tim that i have to break this bad habit and move on.  We agree all the time. He does his own thing and i do mine.. theres no point in talking or seeing eachother.  theres no point in pretending that something will happen between us.  I don't know how to tell him.  I don't want to hurt him because he has feelings.  In another way, i want him to feel the pain of not having me around, not feeling my love.  He and I both know that no other girl will ever love him like i do.  He said it himself. only i care, ii'm a true friend to him.  hell miss me when i'm gone but when i leave it's ganna be for good so he better notice it noe before it's too late.  i don't want to leave him all alone.  I want to share my life with him, I want to grow old with him and have children with him. But i can not love someone who i can not trust, someone who doesn't appreciate me or make me feel needed, wanted and loved.  I will not be cheated on or lied to.  Tim can't meet those expectations, standards whatever the hell you call them. so i gotta shake it off. i will root for our love though."

"event","I am not looking forward to starting class in ten minutes.  i am so tired of school and people in general.   I am frustrated with my friends because they are always broke and expecct me to smoke with them.  WTF!!  So yea.. Mark is ignoring me.  I called four times yesterday and i know he was home!  I can understand that he doesn't want to call my house but at least call my phone.  I went to sleep so early last night- 830!  Tim said we were going to chill yesterday, no he never called.  Oh well,  i have to be understanding.  Hopefully i will see him today.  I will try to call Mark today, but i know that nothing will change.  I have no family now.  I mean my dad is my family but not like Mark and Kristin, my dad doesn't cook dinner, rent movies or take care of me when i'm sick.  I have aunts and uncles but now i don't have anything that feels like home.  I hate being all alone.  I started going tanning yesterday, hopefully i won't turn orange.  At least i only have five more weeks of school left and then... GRADUATION.  Summer is ganna be so much fun.  i have to remind myself to apply at the dinner by my house.  It is only 814 am and i can not wait for school to be over!  i'm out."

"event","This is my first journal entry.  I am excited to see how special this web site is beacuse the people in class rave about it!  Hi Meg, Laura and Sarah!  Anywys, i hope that this will be a good stress reliver because i don't think i can handle it all anymore.  It's like i have so much stuff to buy and spend money on but i have no money for it at all.  I am always at work but never am comfortable financially.  McDonalds sucks a@#.  Hopefully i will get a new job soon.  I tried to call my brother today but he did not answer the phone.  i hate how he ignores me and my father.  It is so immature, I will be heartbroken if he pulls another "" i don't want to talk to you anymore"".  i don't have a reletionship with my other niece, he is not ganna fuck this up for Arianna.  He is selfish and i am tired of it.  Thank God, I don't have to work today.  Timmy said that he wants to chill with me.  We'll see at 3.  i really do not want to go to gym class but if i miss another class, i can't graduate!  untill next time
Jessica"

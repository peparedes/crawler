"event","<b>Yesterday Me and shana and some of my family Drove all the way to riverside to watch Star Wars 3 at the drive-in movie theatre. It was fuckin awesome. Me and shana laid on the ground and ate pizza while we watched the movie. Thats the best way to watch it. The movie got over at like 11 and it was an hour long drive back to long beach to drop off shana and a 30 min dive back to downey, so of course my mom was really tired and she started to fall asleep on the road. We almost crashed it was actually pretty funny for some reason. Yup so obviously if I'm updating my journal at at 11:30 on a monday I didn't go to school, So there goes my 3 week streak of not missing school.
     Movie Tickets: $15
     Pizza and soda: $15
     Gas: $34
     Watching star wars with friend and hearing your aunt yell ""oh no! Yogurt!"" when yoda falls: Priceless

Haha that was pretty funny. Last night really was great."

Ya it was weird cause I called my mom and she was just like ""I got your guitars in the car with your amp and some clothes and a 2 liter and i called shana and I'm taking you to shanas house."" I was just like ok. Haha ya I opened my soda and when I opened it everything was fine but then it just started going everywhere and shana was just sitting there laughing her ass off. Ya she said I started yelling for help. It was great. Well I'm sure shana prolly wants me to get off so I'm out."

"event","<b>Well I got my progress report. Who is else is in trouble? haha. This was my worst report card in my whole life. I've never did this bad. Lets just say my highest grade was a D and I only recieved 1 of those. I thought my mom was going to kill me when I showed it to hear but sje was chill about it. I think she was high or something because obviously she wasn't acting herself. Usually I wouldbe cowering in fear as she yelled and took all my ""privledges"" away but she just told me to do better. I was very confused. I still kinda am.
     Somethings been wrong with me lately. I know evelyns noticed because everyday at school she keeps poking me and asking me whats wrong because she says I look like I'm going to cry and for those of you who know me, I don't cry. None of my friends have ever seen me cry. Nicole had the privledge of hearing me cry over the phone once though haha and she was scared. But ya theres seriously something wrong and I don't know what! I guess I'm just lonely or something. I have my friends and I'm grateful for them because theyre the best group of friends I could ever ask for but sometimes that just doesn't seem to be enough. 
    Ok well thats enough of my complaining. I've been starting to play guitar again becuase I went awhile without playing but its great playing again, music has always been my one emotional outlet. I'm tying to learn a black sabbath song and a metallica song right now, theyre both coming along great. Well I really don't know what else to say so I'll talk to you cool kids later.

P.S. Pray for Dannys(singer of NP) brother Dave who was in a bombing accident while in Iraq fighting a war that we shouldn't be fighting. Hes in critical condition."

"event","Well I didn't go to school today because I had a doctors appointment and that lasted forever. After that me and my mom decided to go down 4th street and check out the stores. We went to the little shop called Roadside Room and they had a sweatshirt in there that I wanted (i'ma go back for it :D). We also got Erics hair cut a few hops away from there and he looks like a pimp now. Then we decided we wanted some coffee and there was this little coffee place not to far called Portfollio (I think thats what it was called) and so we went there and I really liked it. Its a kinda place where you could just chill, I think I'll go back again sometime. After that we went to the $1 movies and saw MAn Of The House it was pretty funny. Thats all I did today, it was pretty fun. I got some new pants!!! I was so happy cause I've been wanting new jeans for awhile."

I got a ticket from school, yesterday me and Evelyn got picked up and taken to the Truancy center and because of that I have to go live with my Grandma for awhile. I was supposed to stay with her tonight but what happened you may ask? I woke up in a great deal of pain and my mom said she couldn't do anything about it because she had to go to school. So I spend a majority of the day in a lot of pain waiting for my mom to get home so I could go to the hospital. I go to the hospital and they run a bunch of fucking tests anfd keep me there for like 5 freakin hours but they still don't know whats wrong with me so they sent me home! What the fuck! They told me to come back if I become unconcious or the pain starts spreading to somewhere else. Why don't they try and help me now! why must I come back when its worse? They might as well just say come back when your dead! I'm still fucking hurting but theres nothing they can do. Arrg I hate hospitals."

Earlier this morning me and my mom got in our first argument in monthes, she was the one who started it though. I was trying to be nice but she just kept on criticizing me so I started yelling at her, I think thats why my throat got worse and she could tell that my throat was hurting because I could hardly talk anymore so she tried to be nice but I was too pissed off so I broke my mic she got me (it was a toy one haha).

I think it was becasue this time I actually got involved and talked to people. I did the water balloon toss which we lost because my mom can't catch shit, and I played bingo (I was always one away from winning) and we had a water gun fight which was between me and this one guy because he randomly just started shooting me so I took my little brothers gun and shot back until we got yeld at because the old people were getting wet. I also did the cake walk and I was the first person to win so hahahaha to all those who didn't

Today - I got up early (11am that is early) and I went to the 99cent store and got some gum for school and some arizona iced tea (yummy but don't have both of them at the same time I learned the hard way) then I went to wal-mart and got the folder I needed for evening school and T-shirt for joey(my puppy) some other crap I can't remember and then we took my little joey to Pet co. to get his nails clipped and the guy that worked there was sOoOoOo freakin cute and his name was joey too haha. Then after that we went to the Elephant Bar which was awesome cause I've never been there before and ya it was awesome lol.

Thursday Sept. 16 - It was the first day of practice which ok for a first day. I also had evening school and it was cool cause I met some knew people in that class and we had a really interesting conversation.

Sunday Sept. 19 - Me and Nicole went to raging waters. We had an awesome time until I got kidnapped haha ask me and I'll tell you about it.It was awesome because we got to ride there in one of those classic 50's cars.

Monday Sept. 20 - I went and ordered my glasses, and I found out we have to move because our landlord is a bitch.

Friday Sept. 24 (today)- I went to school which actually wasn't that bad at all and it was the first day I wore my glasses and I had interesting reaction when people saw me in them (Jose pointed and laughed). After school I had a doctors appointment to go get some tests done that my psychiatrist recommended to see if its ok for me to take zoloft or some shit like that cause he says I'm depressed. The blood test went fine (those fucking vampires taking my blood!) but I had no idea what an EKG test was so when the doctor told me I needed to take off my shirt I was like WTF?!? and ya I'm going to stop talking about that now. But anyways things have been going ok in my life for right now but I know that will change when it comes time to move which is going to suck ass because I finally have my room the way I like it. Oh well. Thats all for now."

Then we went to a uniform store to get some stuff for eric and then we went to tower record to get my ticket but now I have to get $8 to go to randalls show at the allen theatre.

Oh and the dude that threw up the gold fish was fucking nasty too, I almost threw up.

Yesterday I went to EPHS and found out I passed english with an A so I'm really happy about that but then I had to go to my grandmas house after cause I needed a ride to practice. Yesterday was the last practice and it was a lot of fun. It was great getting to see nicole, eddie, jason, ramon, and everybody again.

I also started talking to this really nice guy named Joe recently. He is really cute and he has the sexiest voice on the phone. I called him the other night but no one needs to know what we talked about. Well I guess thats all thats been going on lately. Oh i forgot to mention I'm leaving on sunday. I'm going to Stockton but I'll be back on wednesday, I'll updat again when I get back."

"event","<b>Yesterday was my second meeting with my therapist and she suggested that I see a psychiatrist to see if I should be on some kind of medication because I have trouble sleeping and she thinks I might be depressed. I also almost got kicked out of EPHS today becasue if you miss it 2 times they have to kick you out and i missed today but my teacher doesn't want to kick me out because I'm the only one out of her 60 students who have actually earned credits this summer and because I earned them so quickly that she thinks if I'm more dedicated I can earn the rest of them before EPHS closes which will be on august 13. So she wants me to come in tomorrow to take 3 tests and get a shit load of work to do cause I'm taking off on sunday to go to stockton to take bryan back home. So I'll miss my therapy session on monday so I have to call her and tell her I can't make it.

yesterday I finally went to the museum of tolerance after my therapy. It is an awesome museum. They did a mini model of Aushwitz. Plus they have you go through tunels that lead to gas chambers just like the jews had to do. It was so sad but bryan was being an ass becasue he doesn't really get what happened to the jews because he's a stupid ass jock. After we went to the museum we drove down Rodeo drive and stopped and asked some rich looking people in front of one of the stores where the nearest wal-mart was. It was funny as hell. then we went to hollyweird and then we went to downtown los angeles and went shopping. I got some nice shit down there and its so fucking cheap. well I gotta do i have homework to do.<b>"

You build up all these defenses. You build up this whole armor, for years, so nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They don't ask for it. They do something dumb one day like kiss you, or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so a simple phrase like 'maybe we should just be friends' or 'how very perceptive' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart.

Then I went to the store and bought a new shirt for the band concert which sucked cause I screwed up my solo. After I played i went to LBJCB which was ok cause I got to see matt. I'm really starting to like him alot. He was so sweet to me tonight. It would have been better if Nicole or Evelyn but oh well. There also not going to the parade on Sat so I don't know if I'll go cause I don't wanna be a loner. Well I have nothing else to say so i'm out.<b>"

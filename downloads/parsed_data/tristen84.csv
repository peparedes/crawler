"event","<p></p><p>So I think it&#39;s about time I updated my LJ with some of the fic I&#39;ve written over the past few years (not that anybody&#39;s reading, but I&#39;d like to have them archived here as well).

Young Justice is currently the fandom of my heart. I write predominantly hurt/comfort, team and friendship stories; most of them will be Robin/Nightwing/Dick Grayson-centric, and will usually feature Wally/Kid Flash quite heavily as well. I just really love their friendship so expect to see a lot of that in my stories (but I suppose you could also view it as (pre)-birdflash if you wanted).

<b>Devotion (Daddy!bats, team-friendship)</b>
Robin has been kidnapped and Batman races to rescue him, learning something new about the Young Justice team in the process. (~9000 words)

<b>Entrust (Dick/Wally friendship or pre-birdflash) </b>
Robin and Kid Flash have only recently become friends. While accompanying their mentors and Superman on a mission, they defy Batman&#39;s orders and go off on their own. Naturally, things don&#39;t go as well as planned. (~9000 words)

<b>Remembrance (Daddy!bats)</b>
Bruce goes to visit the site of his parents&#39; murder in Crime Alley but refuses to bring Dick along for fear of something bad happening to him. Dick, of course, goes anyway. (~4500 words)
<span style=""color:#444444;""><span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size:9.0pt;""><a href=""https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9972861/1/Remembrance"" target=""_blank"">ffnet</a> I <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/1109849"" target=""_blank"">AO3</a></span></span></span>

<b>Fear (Dick/Wally friendship or pre-birdflash)</b>
While on a stake-out together, Robin and Kid Flash have a frightening run-in with Scarecrow. (~19,000 words)

"event","Yay, <lj user=""fandom_stocking"" /> 2012 is live! For those of you not in the know, it&#39;s a sort of fest where you can submit your stocking (wishlist) so others can &quot;fill&quot; it. You can fill other people&#39;s stockings by commenting with fic, icons, holiday wishes, etc. You&#39;re not obligated to fill anyone&#39;s stocking when you post your own wishlist, but it would be nice, of course ;o) Also, you can fill people&#39;s stockings when you haven&#39;t posted a wish list of your own.

All stockings are tagged by fandom, which makes it easier to find stockings to fill. They&#39;re still posting stockings (mine&#39;s <a href=""http://fandom-stocking.dreamwidth.org/289198.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and sorting tags, so keep checking back. Rules, etc. at the link in case you&#39;d like to participate, and you can still sign up <a href=""http://fandom-stocking.dreamwidth.org/265217.html"">here</a>. It&#39;s being hosted on Dreamwidth this year rather than on LJ, but you can easily sign in with Open IDs.

I have no idea where I&#39;m going to find the time to fill people&#39;s stockings, but I&#39;ve been looking forward to this event all year because it&#39;s just so much fun to take a look at other people&#39;s stockings and see if I can leave them a present, even if it&#39;s just a tiny little thing :o) I&#39;m hoping to be able to write a few short stories or drabbles at least, but we&#39;ll see.

I&#39;m just excited that Christmas is now officially underway! :oD"

"event","I haven&#39;t been around in a while. I&#39;ve been very busy with school, teaching &nbsp;and other stuff lately to do much more than&nbsp;keep up with&nbsp;my f-list. But now I&#39;m finally&nbsp;on my autumn break (yay!), which means I&#39;ve got some time to catch up on things I&#39;ve missed.<br /><br />So, Flashpoint!<br /><lj-cut text=""Flashpoint and other stuff""><br />I&#39;ve been watching faithfully every week and the episodes are good, but...I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t really feel the love anymore :o( Pretty much&nbsp;every episode&nbsp;is still making me cry and I still watch the eps as soon as I get a chance, but I guess I miss last season&#39;s family feel. I suppose season 4 is just an extremely hard season to top for me, because there was so much team-y goodness and so much Spike angst, whereas&nbsp;this season I guess it&#39;s mostly going to be about the Ed angst.<br /><br />There have been some nice moments, of course. Eyes In was a great Spikesode and I&#39;ve loved the Spike and Greg scenes together. Also, Leah! I miss Raf, but I&nbsp;like Leah too, so I&#39;m happy she&#39;s back.&nbsp;But I just miss the team-y/family stuff.&nbsp;I&#39;m still enjoying the show; I&#39;m just not as invested in it anymore. I don&#39;t feel the&nbsp;mad urge to write fic, like I did last season. I really do think a long hiatus hurts a show, because viewers tend to find other shiny things to obsess about (okay, I realize the casual viewer doesn&#39;t obsess, but I do! ;o)). I have so many FP fic started that I do hope to finish some day, but I just haven&#39;t felt the urge to do that at all yet, so yeah...I guess I just need a major Spike angst or Spike in danger ep to&nbsp;get me back into the writing mood for Flashpoint. ;o)<br /><br />The past few months I&#39;ve been dabbling in an old fandom of mine (the Hardy Boys) and I&#39;ve been getting my feet wet in a new one: Young Justice. It&#39;s a cartoon (yup, I&#39;m such a big kid!) that basically centers around&nbsp;a team of DC sidekicks. I happened to catch an episode and was immediately drawn by Robin (the Dick Grayson incarnation), because the animation is just really pretty! And I like pretty ;o) So I know what I&#39;ll be doing during my autumn break, fandom-wise&nbsp;;o)<br /></lj-cut><br />"

"event","<p>Tomorrow it&#39;s&nbsp;back to school&nbsp;with me. *siiiiiiighs*&nbsp;I can&#39;t believe my 8 weeks of summer break are&nbsp;over! And what have I got to show for it fandom-wise? Nothing! ACK!<br /><br />Granted, it&#39;s not like I spent those weeks loitering about picking my nose; the fact that I didn&#39;t have anything college-related going on doesn&#39;t mean that I didn&#39;t have to work or anything. I worked quite a lot&nbsp;and then I also had a translation to do and some promo texts to edit. My free time I mostly spent reading (Hardy Boys fic -- my very first fandom) and catching up with friends who I&#39;d neglected for the past year or so. So it&#39;s not like those weeks&nbsp;weren&#39;t well-spent, but still! I had so many writing plans and they all amounted to nothing! *pouts* I just couldn&#39;t find the right headspace for it and I didn&#39;t have inspiration anyway. Chances are that once Flashpoint S5 kicks off (20 September - mark your calenders!), I&#39;ll find myself getting obsessed enough to start writing again, only I probably won&#39;t have time to work on much. It&#39;s gonna be a crazy first semester at college, so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be around much at all, but I&#39;ll try to keep up.<br /><br />Having said that, I&#39;ve decided to try and write at least 50 words of fanfic a day to get the creative juices flowing. Doesn&#39;t matter which fandom or what story, as long as I write <i>something</i>. Hopefully 50 words a day will prove to be an achievable enough target&nbsp;even when I&#39;m drowning in assignments and projects and stuff. We&#39;ll see!<br /><br />And now I will leave you with a few&nbsp;spoilers&nbsp;for the new Flashpoint season! Under the cut ;o)</p><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Spoilers!""><br /><b>Episode description episode 1:</b><br /><i>Broken Peace<br />Team One is in pursuit of James Mitchell, an armed man hunting for his ex-wife.</i><br /><br /><b>Episode description episode 7:</b><br /><span class=""formatting_i""><i>The broad daylight assassination of a biker gang&#39;s president and his family starts the clock on a race to prevent all-out war from breaking out on the streets of Toronto. The SRU must defuse not only the situation, but bombs in public places. In the meantime, a young confidential informant puts his life on the line to stop the gang&#39;s new leader from spilling more innocent blood.</i><br />(from IMDB)<br /><br />I think you can probably guess which description interests me more right now... I mean, bombs! That&#39;s gotta mean Spike&#39;ll have plenty to do, right? ;o) EEEEEEEEEEE!!!! *bounces!*</span><br /></lj-cut><br />"

Wow, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve posted! Uni&#39;s pretty much been eating&nbsp;my time&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;my brain for the past few...well, months, really. And I should be studying for my exam and assessment next week right now, but I decided to take the day off to try and do some catching up.

So, hi! :o) How the heck is everyone?

I&#39;m really looking forward to the summer hols, which, for me, start next Friday. Woohooo! There&#39;s SO MUCH I want to do when I finally get some time to relax! Most of all,&nbsp;I want to get back into writing and I&#39;ve even signed up for <lj user=""hc_bingo"" />&nbsp;in hopes it&#39;ll give me the push and inspiration I need to write and finish fic again.

*bounces!* I&#39;m excited! <span style=""font-size: smaller;"">(and also kinda worried that I won&#39;t be able to even fill one square...;o)) </span>Got a lot of different fandoms in mind, too! EEEEEEE!!

There&#39;s this 100 things meme going around that I&#39;d like to do something with too. Somebody on my f-list is doing 100 favourite scenes in books, TV-shows, movies, etc. and I&#39;d love to do something similar. Gonna think on that a little more.

Also, I have a new obsession: Dr. Spencer Reid from Criminal Minds ;o) I&#39;ve never been into Criminal Minds because of all the gore and gruesome murders (I like whump, but I draw the line at chopped off limbs and guts getting ripped out all over the place..), but then as I was working on one of my reports, I caught an ep where the brilliant, but awkward young Dr. Reid was kidnapped and tortured and, well, I was sold! LOL! What I love about Reid is that he&#39;s so vulnerable and therefore highly whumpable. Also, he&#39;s the youngest on the team and since the team&#39;s&nbsp; one big family, they all feel very protective of him, which, yeah, pretty much pushes all my buttons! ;o)&nbsp;

<lj-cut text=""Spencer Reid"">
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/tristen84/pic/0001e156/""><img alt="""" height=""316"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/tristen84/pic/0001e156"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" width=""367"" /></a>

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/tristen84/pic/0001fd1x/""><img alt="""" height=""344"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/tristen84/pic/0001fd1x"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" width=""458"" /></a>
</lj-cut>

Tell me, does he not just radiate vulnerability? ;o)

Anyway, I still don&#39;t like the gruesomeness of the show, so I&#39;m just going to filter for Reid/teamy eps and skip to the good parts ;o) As soon as my assessment&#39;s over, that is.

Of course, this doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve forgotten about Flashpoint (or RW, for that matter)! It&#39;s just that there&#39;s been too little in the way of spoilers and stuff for the new season to really sustain my obsession. And I suppose it&#39;s kind of a good thing or I would&#39;ve been far more devastated by the news of the show ending with season 5 than I&nbsp;am now. Also, having something else to fan on makes the long wait for the new season (and for New Ally in the case of RW...;o))&nbsp;so much more bearable ;o)

Next Friday is the start of my summer break. Expect to hear more from me very soon! :o)"

It&#39;s a great city with lots of cultural things to see and do, like theatre. Very friendly people, too :o) I hope to find an internship there next year, so I can spend a few months to explore the city further and to hopefully do a little bit more travelling. Well, and to work, obviously ;o)<br /><br /><b>Books</b><br /><br />Most of the books I love are books that feature hurt/comfort and friendship (so, basically, same as what I like to write about ;o)) in some way. I like fantasy, action/adventure&nbsp;and historical fiction, but enjoy mystery and a lot of other genres as well. As long as I like the characters and the characters care about each other, I&#39;ll probably love it ;o)<br /><br />Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t had much time to read anything for recreational purposes lately, though I keep buying new books. Which means I&#39;ve got about 30 books lying around right now that I have yet to get around to reading. Really looking forward to getting some time off so I can get started&nbsp;on some of them!&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Snow</b><br /><br />I love snow...when I don&#39;t have to go out in it ;o) It&#39;s so pretty and always gets me in a Christmas mood, but my country&#39;s usually totally unprepared for even relatively small amounts of snow, which generally means utter chaos.&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Water</b><br /><br />I&#39;m a decent swimmer. Which is good, &#39;cause I live in a country&nbsp;they say is going to be completely submerged by 2050 ;o)<br /><br /><b>Snakes</b><br /><br />Don&#39;t really have a problem with snakes, but that&#39;s probably just because I&#39;ve never actually seen one in the wild. They&#39;re pretty uncommon here and the ones we do have are <i>tiny</i>.&nbsp;Relatively speaking.<br /><br /><b>Writing</b><br /><br />I&nbsp;think I started writing fanfic when I was 15 (though at the time I didn&#39;t know it was called fanfic ;o), and my very first fandom was&nbsp;The Hardy Boys. Unfortunately, I&#39;m one of those people&nbsp;who rarely manages to finish&nbsp;a story, so for most of my fandoms I only wrote a whole bunch of scenes.&nbsp;Flashpoint&#39;s the first fandom I&#39;ve&nbsp;managed to actually write and complete stories for, and that in itself&nbsp;is motivating me to write more :o)<br /><br /><b>Plaid</b><br /><br />Uhm...no idea? Not very popular around here (as far as I know),&nbsp;so I don&#39;t really have&nbsp;much to say about&nbsp;it ;o)<br /></lj-cut><br />"

So very cold. His body was shaking and he wondered what the hell was going on. There was a buzzing in his ear, too, and beeping. He managed to drag his heavy eyelids open and panicked, for a second, when all he saw were white walls and bright lights. Then, a familiar face came into view. When he noticed that the lips were moving, he realized that the buzzing in his ears was actually a voice speaking to him.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Spike, it&rsquo;s okay. Go back to sleep. You&rsquo;re gonna be okay. You&rsquo;ll be warm soon.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Though he recognized both the voice and the face of the person who was talking to him, his mind was apparently too sluggish to supply a name. Yet, he knew he trusted this person and if he said to go back to sleep then that&rsquo;s what he should do. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">He was still shivering, but drifted off almost as soon as he closed his eyes. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">*</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;All right, here we go,&quot; Sam said as he swung open the door to Spike&#39;s apartment and stepped aside to let Spike enter.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;You know, I don&#39;t mean to sound ungrateful or anything, but you didn&#39;t have to walk me all the way up to my apartment,&quot; Spike told him as he walked in. &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">It had been two days since Spike had fallen into the icy waters of the Humber River and he&#39;d only just been discharged from the hospital. Things had been touch and go for a while and Sam was pretty sure none of the team had any fingernails left, including Jules. Only after long hours of uncertainty had it become clear that their team member was going to pull through. Sam could still see the relieved expressions on everyone&#39;s faces when they&#39;d received the news.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Sure you are,&quot; Sam replied belatedly, closing the door behind him. &quot;That&rsquo;s why you were constantly nodding off on the way here. And anyway,&quot; he added as he watched Spike clumsily take off his thick coat, &quot;Jules would kill me if she found out I <i>didn&#39;t</i> walk you to your apartment.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;She wouldn&#39;t.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam paused in turning up the thermostat to give his friend an incredulous look. &quot;Yes, she would. Have you met her?&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike chuckled. &quot;I meant, she wouldn&#39;t find out. I don&#39;t doubt that she&#39;d kill you.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Oh. Well, believe me, Jules has her ways of finding things out,&quot; Sam said. He was about to turn back to the door when he caught Spike shivering, despite the warm jogging pants and heavy sweater he was wearing. Sam immediately slipped into Team Leader mode. &quot;Okay, Spike, you go make yourself comfortable on the couch, I&#39;m gonna go get you some blankets.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Sam, really, I&#39;m good,&quot; Spike protested, though he did sit down. &quot;You don&#39;t have to-&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam didn&#39;t hear the rest as he was already making his way to where he assumed Spike&#39;s bedroom would be. He grabbed one of the pillows off the bed and stripped the bed of its blankets. Back in the living room, where he found Spike leaning back against the cushions of the sofa, Sam dumped the blankets in Spike&#39;s lap. The pallor of his friend&#39;s face startled him. There had definitely been some colour in his cheeks when they&rsquo;d left the hospital only half an hour ago. The short walk to Sam&rsquo;s car and from the car to Spike&rsquo;s apartment must&rsquo;ve really worn him out. &quot;Lie down, Spike,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&#39;m gonna get some hot cocoa going.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Sam, I&#39;m f-&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Spike, you almost died,&quot; Sam interrupted him. &quot;And you <i>still</i> look like death warmed over. Now, lie down.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike stared at him, eyes wide. &quot;O-kay, when you put it like that,&quot; he muttered, before slowly stretching out on the couch and arranging the blankets.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Satisfied, Sam purposefully strode into the kitchen and rummaged around in the cupboards until he found a mug and cocoa powder. Five minutes later, he carried the steaming mug into the living room. &quot;All right, Spike, now-&quot; he snapped his mouth shut when he spotted Spike curled up beneath the blankets, apparently sound asleep.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam smiled and quietly set down the cocoa on the coffee table. He made sure Spike was no longer shivering before heading to the door, intending to leave - only to almost trip over a pile of boxes in the middle of the floor. They were big moving boxes and he glanced around, wondering where they had come from.&nbsp; As he did so, he noticed more boxes, most of them tucked away in corners, lending the room a rather cold and lonely atmosphere.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">In fact, the whole room seemed kind of&hellip;bare. The furniture was there, but all three bookcases that lined the far wall were empty and so were the CD/DVD racks in one of the corners of the room. There were no pictures or paintings or any other personal mementos, and, now that Sam thought about it, there was a distinct lack of Christmas decorations given the time of year. Spike was a big fan of Christmas, but you would never be able to tell by the current cheerless state of the apartment.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">An uncomfortable feeling settled in Sam&#39;s stomach and as he looked back at the sleeping figure on the sofa, he just couldn&#39;t bring himself to leave his friend alone in a comfortless apartment like this. He slipped into Spike&rsquo;s bedroom so as not to disturb his sleeping friend, pulled his cell phone from his jeans pocket and dialed. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Hey, Ed, it&rsquo;s Sam&hellip;. Yeah, just got him home. He&#39;s asleep&hellip; Listen, Ed, we gotta do something about Spike&rsquo;s apartment.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">*</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">When Spike woke several hours later, it was to hushed voices and quiet Christmas carols. He slowly blinked his eyes open and was astonished to find himself the centre of all kinds of hustle and bustle. He spotted Jules decorating a Christmas tree &ndash; one he didn&rsquo;t remember getting &ndash; and Ed, who was hanging up Christmas lights all around his living room. Sam was arranging picture frames on a side table and then there was Raf, who was unpacking a box full of books and putting them away in one of the bookcases Spike hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to filling yet. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Wincing at the stiffness of his body, Spike propped himself up on an elbow and frowned. He had just opened his mouth to ask what on earth they were all doing in his apartment when his boss emerged from the kitchen with a tray loaded with&hellip;cookies?</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Greg caught Spike&#39;s eye and his face immediately lit up with a smile. &quot;Spike,&quot; he said, sounding both surprised and relieved. He set down the tray on the coffee table and pulled up a chair. &quot;How are you feeling, buddy?&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Good, I&rsquo;m good, boss,&quot; Spike replied automatically, &quot;but what are you-? Guys, what&#39;s going on?&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Ed had abandoned his lights to stand behind Greg&rsquo;s chair. &quot;Well, Sam here,&quot; he said, jerking his thumb at Sam and grinning, &quot;got us some valuable intel on the sorry state of your new apartment, so we decided to remedy the situation.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike stared, at a loss for words, and Greg chuckled and patted his knee. &quot;Come on, Spike, did you really think we were gonna let you spend Christmas Eve on your own?&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike slowly began to shake his head, but stopped when Greg&#39;s words sank in. &quot;Christmas Eve? It&#39;s <i>Christmas Eve</i>?!&quot; He immediately disentangled himself from the blankets and swung his feet to the floor, ignoring the light-headedness the move caused. &quot;Guys, what are you <i>doing</i> here? It&#39;s Christmas Eve! Why aren&#39;t you spending it with your families?&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;We <i>are</i> spending it with family, Spike,&quot; Jules said, pausing in her strategic placement of tinsel to give him a gentle smile.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike looked at her and then at the rest of his team. Sam and Raf were both smiling and nodding and Greg and Ed were grinning like fools. Spike swallowed hard. &quot;Thanks, guys. Really. Just- thanks.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Well, don&#39;t thank us just yet,&quot; Raf spoke up suddenly, holding a couple of books in each hand. &quot;We may have totally screwed up your filing system. I mean, do you alphabetize your books? &#39;Cause I can still change it around if you want, no problem. The DVDs may take some time though, &lsquo;cause, dude, you got a lot of them and-&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">They all burst into laughter, and Spike was grateful for the distraction. &quot;Raf,&quot; he interrupted his team mate, chuckling. &quot;Raf, you did an awesome job. It&#39;s perfect. Thank you.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you haven&rsquo;t switched to one of those e-reader things by now, Spike,&rdquo; Ed observed.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh, but I have,&rdquo; Spike replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in one of those other boxes.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Of course it is. Ed, how could you have doubted him?&rdquo; Greg remarked with a chuckle as Ed shook his head, grinning. Spike laughed, and Greg got up from the chair, rubbing his hands together. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who wants to try some of Marina&rsquo;s home-made Christmas cookies?&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">*</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Hey,&quot; Sam said as he sat down next to Spike, who was once again bundled up in blankets on the sofa. They had just finished clearing the table from all the bowls and plates they&#39;d used for dinner and Sam had been kicked out of the kitchen because, apparently, he&#39;d been getting in the way. &ldquo;You okay?&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You always say that,&rdquo; Sam said, regarding his friend critically. Spike still looked pale, but better than he had that afternoon, when his face had almost been white. &ldquo;But at least you don&#39;t look like the walking dead anymore.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike quirked an eyebrow at him and laughed. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Listen, uh&hellip;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind me calling in the cavalry.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike looked at him, eyebrows raised in silent question. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Well, I just&hellip;wasn&#39;t sure you&#39;d be okay with us going through some of your personal stuff.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike shrugged. &quot;As long as you didn&#39;t let Jules go through my underwear&hellip; You didn&#39;t, did you?&quot; Spike added, pretending to look fearful.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam chuckled. &quot;No, we didn&#39;t, though we were tempted for a minute there.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike smiled but quickly grew serious. &quot;Truth is I needed the help,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Between the job, keeping up with all the tech and stuff that&#39;s out there, and everything else that&#39;s been going on, I just haven&#39;t had the time to actually finish moving in.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Why didn&#39;t you say something? We would&#39;ve helped out.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;I thought I could handle it. And anyway, it&rsquo;s not like you guys have been sitting on your hands lately.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Riiight,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;Next time, Spike, just call.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You know, Sam,&rdquo; Spike said, suddenly regarding him with a raised eyebrow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been gettin&rsquo; awfully bossy lately.&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam raised his hands, feigning innocence. &ldquo;Hey, it comes with Team Leader territory.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not Team Leader just yet, Samtastic,&rdquo; Spike replied with an obvious twinkle in his eye, and Sam laughed, relieved that Spike was feeling up to a little banter. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Just then, an unexpected yawn popped Spike&rsquo;s jaw open and he glanced at Sam apologetically.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam smiled and got up. &ldquo;You should get some more rest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll finish up here.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah, go get some sleep.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;And again with the bossiness,&rdquo; Spike remarked as he lay back down on the sofa and made himself comfortable.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam chuckled and started to make his way to the kitchen when Spike&rsquo;s quiet voice stopped him. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Hey, Sam?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.

He glanced back at the quiet bundle of blankets on the sofa. &ldquo;Merry Christmas, Spike,&rdquo; he said softly and turned to enter the kitchen.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">A sleepy mumble was his reply. &ldquo;M&rsquo;ry &#39;mas.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />A/N: Surprise! It&#39;s a Christmas fic! ;o) An extremely late one at that (or early, depending on how you look at it). I started this story in December, but didn&#39;t get around to finishing it until about a week ago. And since I didn&#39;t want to wait 10 months before posting it, I thought, what the heck.

He felt a hand wrap itself around his ankle and glanced down long enough to identify its owner: Raf. Sam nodded gratefully at his team mate and quickly turned back to where Spike was trying to hoist himself onto the ice -- only to watch in horror as Spike lost his grip and fell back into the freezing water. &ldquo;Spike! Boss, he went under! I lost hi- there!&rdquo; he shouted, immediately adjusting his heading when he saw Spike break the surface again just a meter or so down the stream. &ldquo;Spike! Spike, hold on!&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike clawed at the ice, his fingers desperately scrabbling for purchase, and finally managed to dig the fingernails of his left hand into a tiny crack. Sam pushed himself forward, knowing how tenuous Spike&#39;s hold would be: he didn&rsquo;t just have to support his own weight, but about thirty pounds worth of gear as well. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Slow and careful, Sam, or you&rsquo;ll fall right in after him,&rdquo; Greg reminded him through his ear piece. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s good. Raf, make sure you don&rsquo;t lose him!&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, boss, I got Sam. Not lettin&#39; go!&rdquo; Raf shouted back over the radio and Sam felt the grip on his ankle tighten.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam edged across the ice as far as he could without dragging Raf with him, and reached out his hand. &ldquo;Spike! Spike, grab my hand!&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike kicked and reached out, but couldn&rsquo;t quite grasp Sam&rsquo;s outstretched fingers. He fell back and only just managed to keep his hold on the ice. Sam could tell Spike was weakening, the freezing water leeching his strength; his face was white and his lips were already taking on a bluish tinge. &ldquo;Raf!&rdquo; Sam called out. &ldquo;Raf, I can&rsquo;t reach him! I need a little more leeway!&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You got it!&rdquo; Raf shouted back and Sam instantly felt him give his leg a boost.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Go ahead, Raf, I got you. Slow and careful,&rdquo; Sam heard Ed say, and he gained another few precious centimeters.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Ignoring the chill that was seeping through his own uniform, Sam reached out again and stretched his arm as far as he could. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, Spike! Reach!&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike was fading visibly, his eyes becoming dull and unfocused. With a supreme effort he managed to pull his right arm from the water, and reached out once more. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&hellip;&rdquo; Sam encouraged, seizing Spike&rsquo;s icy fingers as soon as they came within his reach and clamping onto his friend&#39;s wrist with his other hand. &ldquo;I got you, Spike! Raf, Ed, I got him! Pull me back!&quot; Sam shouted down the radio. &quot;Hold on, Spike, we&rsquo;re getting you out. Hold on.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike&rsquo;s teeth were chattering so badly he couldn&rsquo;t even reply.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam felt himself being slowly dragged back across the ice and tightened his hold on Spike&rsquo;s wrist, struggling to retain his grip when Spike was shaking so badly. The added weight of Spike&rsquo;s body made the going extremely slow and Sam wondered how long Spike had been exposed to the bitter cold by now. It had taken Sam at least five minutes to even reach his friend and it was probably going to take even longer than that to get him off the ice. He noticed Spike&rsquo;s eyes kept threatening to close, but his friend was fighting hard to stay awake.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Spike?&rdquo; Sam said, digging his thumb nail into Spike&rsquo;s skin. &ldquo;Stay with us, Spike.&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike responded to the stimulus by opening his eyes a little wider, but Sam could tell it took far more effort than it should.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Jules, you get those blankets?&rdquo; Greg&#39;s worried voice crackled in his ear.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Got &lsquo;em right here, boss.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Winnie, where the hell are those EMTs?&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Almost there, Sarge!&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam tried to ignore the voices in his ear and focused all his attention on keeping Spike awake. In the space of a few minutes, Spike&rsquo;s violent shaking had subsided, leaving him shivering weakly. Sam knew it was a bad sign. &ldquo;Hold on, Spike. We&rsquo;re almost there. Stay with us.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Finally, they managed to pull Spike off the ice and safely onto the shore. The rest of the team immediately converged on their freezing team mate. Jules stood by with the blankets while Ed was already yanking down the zipper of Spike&rsquo;s soaked vest. &ldquo;We gotta get him out of these clothes!&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">As the rest of the team worked on getting Spike dry, Sam crouched down beside his shivering team mate to try and shelter him from the wind chill. The contrast between Spike&rsquo;s wet, dark hair and his white face shocked him, and it took him a few seconds to realize Spike&#39;s lips were moving in an effort to speak. Sam hastily bent forward, straining to hear. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike&#39;s voice sounded weak and hoarse, as though he&#39;d been screaming. &quot;S- Sub-ject?&quot; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam straightened a little and smiled tightly. &quot;We got her, Spike,&quot; he said, patting Spike&#39;s now blanketed shoulder. &quot;She&#39;s okay; you got her off the ice in time. The unis have her in custody. You just worry about yourself, all right?&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike nodded weakly and closed his eyes.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;NO!&quot; Sam almost shouted and Spike, startled, dragged his eyelids open. &quot;No, Spike,&quot; Sam said more calmly. &quot;Don&#39;t go to sleep, okay? You gotta stay awake.&quot; Spike just blinked at him sluggishly, still shivering as Ed finished peeling his soaked uniform off of him.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Sam kept talking and didn&rsquo;t realize he was shaking a little himself until someone draped a blanket across his shoulders. When Sam looked up, Greg had knelt on Spike&rsquo;s other side and was leaning forward. &ldquo;Spike. Spike? Are you with me, buddy?&rdquo; he said loudly, trying to get Spike to look at him. Spike was barely conscious, his eyes unfocused and wandering. Greg gently caught Spike&rsquo;s face between his hands and held him still. &ldquo;Spike, look at me. C&rsquo;mon, stay with me.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">Spike, who was now completely wrapped up in blankets, slowly met Greg&rsquo;s gaze, very briefly. Then Sam watched, horrified, as Spike went limp and closed his eyes. And didn&#39;t open them again.</span></span></p></lj-cut><br /><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p>"

Barely. Spike had stayed at his father&rsquo;s bed side the entire time, though he had come down from his adrenaline high just a few hours after he&rsquo;d arrived at the hospital. His head had been pounding and his hands had been trembling slightly, but he had tried to soothe his father&rsquo;s anxiety as best he could. They had talked a little but his father hadn&rsquo;t brought up Spike&rsquo;s job again and Spike was grateful for that. It meant that while his father still didn&rsquo;t approve of his line of work, he had at least accepted that this was what his son had chosen to do for a living and that it wasn&rsquo;t worth spending the precious few hours he had left arguing over. At 7.33 am his father had drawn his last breath, and then he was gone.</span></span></p><p><br /><span style=""font-size: 10pt""><span style=""color: #2a2a2a""><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif"">5.</span></span></span><br /><span style=""font-size: 10pt""><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif"">&quot;That&#39;s his car!

His head was pounding and there was a terrible crick in his neck. He groaned, but it sounded muffled to his own ears. There was something in his mouth, something soft but uncomfortable. When he swallowed, his throat felt painful, which told him he&rsquo;d been out for a while and he wondered what the hell had happened. His mind felt sluggish, but when he found he couldn&rsquo;t lift his arms, a panic seized him.</span></span></p><p><br /><span style=""font-size: 10pt""><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif"">7.</span></span><br /><span style=""font-size: 10pt""><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif"">&quot;Spike!

Flashpoint is a cop show about the SRU (Strategic Response Unit &ndash; sort of like SWAT) whose task is to resolve crisis situations with minimum loss of life. This is also what sets it apart from so many other procedurals: &nbsp;it&rsquo;s not a shoot-first-ask-questions-later kind of show. Most of the &ldquo;subjects&rdquo; are your everyday people who&rsquo;ve often just made bad choices or whose circumstances have driven them to take desperate measures. This frequently requires the team to try and negotiate or talk down the subject, but sometimes more lethal measures need to be taken&hellip;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify""></p><lj-cut text=""Read more, spoiler-free""><p><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri""><span style=""font-size: 10pt""><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif"">Which brings us to the other thing that sets this show apart from a lot of other cop shows: it shows the toll the job takes on police officers and other first responders. It&rsquo;s a character-driven show (though there&rsquo;s still plenty of action and suspense) and the characters have a memory. Everything they see, all the loss, tragedy and sorrow they witness and experience both on and off the job stays with them and changes them. These are characters that grow.<br /><br />The biggest draw to Flashpoint for me, however, is the affection the team has for each other. The main characters on this show really, genuinely love each other and aren&rsquo;t afraid to show it. The team&rsquo;s a family and there are so many wonderful, touching team moments that I often find myself tearing up because they move me so much.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify""></p><p style=""text-align: justify""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri""><span style=""font-size: 10pt""><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif"">The show&rsquo;s just finished up its fourth season and has been renewed for a fifth, which they start shooting in February, so now is&nbsp;a great time to start watching the show and get caught up.

Everything-&ldquo; Greg began as they entered the briefing room, but paused when he was greeted by the sight of his entire team sitting around the briefing table. &ldquo;&hellip;okay?&rdquo; He looked around at the familiar faces and felt his gut clench. &ldquo;Guys? What&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">&ldquo;Well, Greg,&rdquo; Ed said, and Greg turned to see him holding a large, flat, gift-wrapped package that was extravagantly decorated with green, gold and silver bows. &ldquo;We know we did the Secret Santa thing already, but we wanted to give you something from all of us to show you how much we appreciate that we get to keep you as our Sarge so&hellip;here you go.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">&ldquo;Whaaat?&rdquo; Greg sputtered with surprise as he accepted the gift from Ed. He looked around at the rest of his team and found all four of them grinning back at him. &ldquo;So you were all in on this, huh?&rdquo; he said, pretending to eye them all sternly, but unable to suppress another smile. Looking down at the rather heavy gift in his hands though, he hesitated.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">&ldquo;Come on, boss, open it!&rdquo; Spike urged impatiently.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">&ldquo;All right, all right!&rdquo; Greg said, chuckling. It amazed him how, even after the rough year Spike had had, he could still be like a kid when it came to opening presents. Greg made short work of the wrapping, and stared at what he&rsquo;d uncovered. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">It was a plaque. A large, chestnut plaque with names emblazoned on it in gold. There were some personal notes on it, too, and Greg swallowed as he read some of them. Featured prominently were a note from Haley, and another one from Marina. Greg stared long and hard at the words.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">&quot;Read it, Greg,&quot; Ed said gently. &quot;Believe it. That&#39;s a lot of names and these are just the people you saved in the past two years. Every time you start doubting yourself, Greg, you go home and look at this and know that you are saving lives.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">Greg looked up &minus; at Ed, at his team. &quot;How- how did you-?&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">Ed grinned. &quot;Team effort. Jules came up with the idea and Spike worked his magic tracking a few people down. Sam, Raf and I made some house calls.&quot;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">Greg nodded silently and looked down at the plaque once more. He fingered the smooth surface and was lost in memories for a moment as he recognized each and every name. Then he raised his head and took in the anxious expressions on his team&rsquo;s faces. &quot;Team One&hellip;&rdquo; he began, fighting to keep his voice under control. &ldquo;I am&hellip;lost for words&hellip; You are the best team I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of working with. This-&ldquo; he said, gesturing at the plaque, &ldquo;this means more to me than you know, but the best gift I could ever wish for is having you, all of you, as my team and as my family.&rdquo; He paused, struggling to keep his emotions in check, before he chuckled softly and shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I did in a previous life to deserve you all, but it must&rsquo;ve been something pretty damn spectacular.&rdquo;&nbsp; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">His soft laughter broke the spell his team had seemingly been under, because the anxious faces broke into relieved smiles and Ed put his hand on Greg&#39;s shoulder. &ldquo;Greg, buddy, a team&rsquo;s only as good as its Sergeant,&rdquo; Ed said, grinning. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">&ldquo;And its Team Leader,&rdquo; Spike added.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; Sam said and Raf and Jules murmured their agreement.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">Greg looked back at Ed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re right, Eddie,&rdquo; he said, patting his friend on the back.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">&ldquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s the sum of its parts,&rdquo; Ed replied, almost solemnly. Then he laughed. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s almost Christmas Eve, so who am I to argue? Speaking of Christmas&hellip; Raf?&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">&ldquo;Yep, got you covered,&rdquo; Raf said, producing five bottles of beer and a soda out of nowhere. He shared a conspiratorial smile with Ed as Sam, Spike and Jules looked on in surprise, and proceeded to hand out their respective bottles. When they all had their drinks and Greg was in the middle of chastising everyone good-naturedly for keeping this whole thing from him, Raf politely cleared his throat. &ldquo;Could I uh&hellip;say something?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">They all fell silent and shifted their gazes to Raf. For a very brief moment Greg saw Leah, not Raf, standing there. &ldquo;Sure, Raf,&rdquo; he heard Ed say. &ldquo;Please, go ahead.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">Raf looked around at all of them. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve only been with you guys for a few months, but I&rsquo;ve seen what you can do and I&rsquo;m incredibly proud to be a member of this team. From day one you&rsquo;ve made me feel welcome, so I just wanted to thank you for accepting me as part of the family.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">&ldquo;No, thank <i>you</i>, Raf,&rdquo; Greg said, &ldquo;for being willing to learn and for your willingness to put your team members&rsquo; lives before your own even though you&rsquo;d only been with us for a couple of weeks.&rdquo; At that, Spike nodded and gave Raf a grateful smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy and proud to have you here with us.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">Ed raised his bottle, the rest of them automatically doing the same. &ldquo;To the team,&rdquo; he said.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: calibri"">Greg shook his head. &ldquo;No. To family.

I&#39;d expected at least a reference to it from the other characters in the ep that followed Shockwave since it had been such a huge plotline for Spike, but there was nothing, so that was a bit of a letdown.

It was such a huge fandom with such awesome and prolific writers and I really miss having at least one new h/c fic to read every day. There&#39;s very little good Flashpoint fic out there, so I miss the good old SGA days where I&#39;d be all excited pretty much all the time because there was so much good stuff coming out. I also miss the discussions (not that I took part very often, but I loved reading them) and just generally squeeing about episodes.

"event","I&#39;ve been a little out of touch lately and it&#39;s not because there are&nbsp;currently no new&nbsp;Flashpoint episodes airing ;o) I&#39;ve just been incredibly busy: I have about&nbsp;50 reports to write and I have till 15 January to get them all done, so that&#39;s not a whole lot of time. It&#39;s my own fault, really, because I chose to obsess and squee over Flashpoint rather than to&nbsp;start working on&nbsp;all these reports, and I honestly don&#39;t regret making that choice. It just means I&#39;m scrambling right now, which is why I&#39;ve been a little quiet! Hopefully after Jan 15 I&#39;ll be able to kick back a little and get back to the fannish stuff.<br /><br />Speaking of fannish stuff, I still plan on writing at least one more fic(let) for <lj user=""fandom_stocking"" />, but am&nbsp;lacking inspiration at the moment. I want to write something Christmas-y&nbsp;and SHORT&nbsp;but everything I come up with ends up mutating into something really&nbsp;long, and I don&#39;t have time for long!&nbsp;So...would anyone&nbsp;care to prompt me? It can be Ed &amp; Greg friendship or team or something with Spike. I can&#39;t promise it&#39;ll get written, but hopefully it&#39;ll inspire me to write <i>something</i> (other than reports ;o)).<br /><br />Anyway, hope everyone on my f-list has a wonderful Christmas (or insert other appropriate holiday) with family and friends or just with a good movie or book or something else that makes you happy :o)"

When you first meet somebody, you give them your best self, and the more you get to know them, they get to see the rest of you and the love gets deeper when you start accepting the stuff that isn&rsquo;t the best self.

THIS, this is why it&#39;s my favourite show right now and why season 4 is my favourite season to date. So many wonderful team moments and team love and I really, really hope they&#39;ll keep that up in season 5 (and, hopefully, beyond!).

"event","A&nbsp;few days ago I was so jetlagged that I woke up at 5 in the morning and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.

"event","So, wow, I&#39;m only now getting around to writing down my thoughts on this ep!<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Spoilers and love! :o)"">I&#39;d kind of assumed this&#39;d be a filler episode &agrave; la A Call To Arms because there&#39;d been so little buzz about it and the ep descriptions didn&#39;t exactly enamour me either. Which is why I so totally not expected to love this ep. But I did, and I do!<br /><br />The team moments were absolutely amazing. Poor Spike! With his mom moving back to Italy, the team&#39;s really the only family he has left. I felt so sorry for him when Greg was totally oblivious and basically just told him to hurry up and get moving in the locker room. I gotta tell you that my love for Ed grew tenfold just for picking up on Spike&#39;s emotional turmoil and for pointing it out to Greg.<br /><br />Also, poor Greg :o( It&#39;s like he can never get away from the stress and emotional pain. I really like Marina, but she needs to realize that Greg can&#39;t keep being her therapist when he&#39;s just about reached his breaking point himself. As I said over at loisarah&#39;s journal, I wonder if she even knows what happened to him in Day Game. She needs to take charge and give Greg the support he needs right now. I understand she&#39;s been through some traumatic things, but she&#39;s got to be able to be there for Greg too if she wants their relationship to work.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the case, too. I guessed pretty early on that it was Kevin who had killed that kid, but my heart really ached for Chris and I cried for him when the truth finally came out.<br /><br />And then the team moment at the end...my God, that was such an awesome scene with Sam, Ed and Raf being there for Spike. Definitely one of my favourite moments this season. Also, Ed&#39;s got Greg&#39;s back. We already knew that, but he proved it once more in this ep. Ed was totally the team player.</lj-cut><br /><br />This ep was all about team, friendship and family, and that is why I loved it so very much!<br />"

"event","So I was a little too busy yesterday rewatching this ep every spare minute I had to post my thoughts on it, but I&#39;ve finally managed to drag myself away from all that angst and TEAM LOVE and TEAM-Y GOODNESS and just general awesomeness so here I am! God, I&#39;m so in love with this ep (and with Spike, but you already knew that ;o))!

<lj-cut text=""Spoilers 515 Blue On Blue"">I had such high hopes for this ep that, truthfully, I was setting myself up for a huge disappointment. But this ep totally surpassed my expectations! Yes, Natalie was involved and she was being used as leverage to get Spike to do what the bad guys wanted, just as I&#39;d feared, but it really didn&#39;t revolve around her, and there was so much Spike angst (and some whump - hee!) that I just couldn&#39;t not love it!

Spike was his usual genius self and I loved how he could still be a smartass sometimes even though he was under duress (&quot;Last chance, Scarlatti&quot; &quot;I can count!&quot;). Sergio Di Zio was once again amazing; he can convey so many thoughts and emotions just through his eyes and facial expressions, it&#39;s incredible. I sense another Gemini nomination for him... ;o)

Also, we&#39;ve finally gotten to see what happens&nbsp;when you push Spike too far. He&#39;s a gentle, easy-going guy but if you hurt his friends...wow! He was totally past caring&nbsp;about his own life, and I found it really interesting that he said, &quot;after what you did to my friend&#39;s sister and what you did to my team&quot; - he couldn&#39;t care less about what David had done to <i>him</i>. It&#39;s like Spike might&#39;ve forgiven him if David had hurt just him, but now that he&#39;d dared to hurt his friends, all bets were off. Really loved seeing this protective side of Spike. And Spike&#39;s total shutdown when he thought his team had been killed...wow. They clearly mean everything to him.

But what I loved about this ep most of all was the teaminess of it. It was wonderful to finally see Sam and Spike interact a bit more and I simply adored the friendshippy goodness between them in this ep, especially in one of the last scenes where Sam jogs up to Spike and throws an arm around his shoulder. It&#39;s great to finally see that Sam really does care about his team, not just about Jules.

And of course there&#39;s&nbsp;the briefing room scene, which I absolutely adored. I&#39;ve missed these briefing room scenes because they&#39;re usually good for some great team moments, and I&#39;m so happy we got one in this ep. It was perfect!&nbsp;The &quot;Spike, without you around...&quot; &quot;We&#39;d fall apart&quot; from Greg and Ed- oh, TEAM!&nbsp;I just wanted to&nbsp;hug all of them! And poor Spike, thinking he&#39;s cursed or something because people close to him keep getting killed or hurt (I do wish he&#39;d have mentioned Mac as well, &#39;cause that woulda made it even more believable).

I have to say Spike sorta breaking up with Natalie at the beginning of the ep did kinda surprise me. I wonder&nbsp;if he was already having these &quot;people who get close to me end up dying&quot; issues before the whole kidnapping happened and that that&#39;s why he broke up with her or that he really just prefers to&nbsp;stay friends. I hope they&#39;ll give us more glimpses into his psyche in the next few eps or in season 5, because really, it&#39;s pretty&nbsp;rare we get to see Spike lose it and open up like he did.</lj-cut>

All in all, absolutely brilliant episode! Definitely one of my top 3 favourites! Hee! :oD"

And ION&#39;s description for the ep:
<lj-cut text=""Spoilers for 415 Blue On Blue""> When Sam&#39;s sister Natalie is threatened by her drug-running ex-boyfriend, Natalie turns to Spike for help. Without telling Sam, Spike steps up to protect her and winds up in a trap that will force him to recover stolen heroine from a highly secure evidence depot. At the same time, he must square off against an even more dangerous foe: his own team. Putting the many losses (Lou, Oliver, his father) he has sustained recently, Spike deftly wins the confidence of the villains as he jams security frequencies, while simultaneously signaling the SRU where to rescue Natalie and himself.</lj-cut>

"event","Wow.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Spoilers 414 Day Game""> This was an amazing episode. I daresay one of the best this season. Gil was the perfect adversary and Aaron Douglas did a terrific job. So did Enrico Colantoni. I have to admit I don&#39;t like seeing Greg in danger or get hurt, but Enrico was superb in this. I&#39;m really afraid for Greg now though. I have no idea how they&#39;re gonna fix this. How the hell is Toth gonna let Greg stay on Team One as sergeant? And what about those secrets? Is Toth gonna uncover every one of them? And how is Greg gonna back from all this? It&#39;s a little depressing to think about.<br /><br />But SPIKE! Spike was awesome! Loved how he was the one to try and cheer Raf up (of <i>course</i> he would be - it&#39;s Spike!) in the locker room scene. Also loved how he was willing to put his own job on the line for Greg. He would&#39;ve had&nbsp;Greg&#39;s back, if only Greg&nbsp;had let him. Oh, and Spike&#39;s got the world&#39;s worst poker face! I honestly think the guy could never convincingly tell a lie ;o) Loved how he came out of the truck looking all determined and then totally failing to&nbsp;look&nbsp;casual and innocent when Ed catches him. The look on Spike&#39;s face when Greg told him to give him the audio drive...God, he totally is the pup of the team.<br /><br />Cannot wait for next week! Where&#39;s that promo?! :o) </lj-cut>"

"event","<p><span face="""">EEEEEEEE!!! Finally, FINALLY a little bit more info on Blue on Blue! (LJ&#39;s still not letting me use LJ cut, so I&#39;m using spoiler space again)</span><br /><br />S<br />P<br />O<br />I<br />L<br />E<br />R<br />S<br /><br />From TVGuide.com:<br /><i>Blue on Blue<br />Spike responds to a distress call from Sam&#39;s sister and suddenly finds himself held at gunpoint by her criminal ex-boyfriend. Meanwhile, Team One responds to shots fired at a metro depot where two men have broken in to rob it.</i><br /><br />Now,&nbsp;let&#39;s compare this to the following from Michael Shanks&#39; website I posted a while ago:<br /><i>The episode (at filming time) is titled &quot;Blue On Blue&quot;. Michael plays a character named David Fleming, who abducts Mike &quot;Spike&quot; Scarlatti (played by Sergio Di Zio) in order to force him into using his computer skills to aid Fleming&#39;s efforts to steal from the police evidence depot.</i><br /><br />So, yep, Natalie&#39;s definitely involved, and&nbsp;I&#39;m guessing the criminal ex-boyfriend is&nbsp;part of the gang that&#39;s trying to rob the depot. The question&nbsp;is&nbsp;where this&nbsp;is all going to be taking&nbsp;place. Is Fleming&#39;s gonna take Spike to the depot or&nbsp;is he going to force Spike to work his computer magic from some&nbsp;remote computer? And in the case of the former, is&nbsp;he going to take Natalie&nbsp;as leverage? And when&#39;s the rest of the team going to figure out Spike&#39;s in trouble?<br /><br />I really can&#39;t wait to find out! Looking forward&nbsp;to the promo we&#39;ll hopefully get after Day Game. Hee!<br /><br />Anyway, not quite the kind of kidnapping I&#39;d hoped for (I woulda liked to have seen a drugged Spike ;o)), but I&#39;ll take what I can get ;o)</p>"

On a&nbsp;scaffolding high above the ice, he holds Parker hostage in order to win his attention and affirmation. Earlier in the story, Raf is humiliated and angered by Parker&#39;s drills. Later, the newest member of the team realizes that the slightest miscue can put a teammate in jeopardy, as he witnesses how close Parker comes to death today.&quot;<br />"

"event","I thought it was an okay ep. It felt a bit like a filler to me, but it did have some nice moments.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Spoilers for 413"">First: GREG!! And DEAN! And: AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!! I really love how he&#39;s finally got good things happening in his life. First Marina, now Dean. Awesome! He deserves to be happy! Now let&#39;s just hope he stays that way... (Yeah, I&#39;m looking at you, writers).<br /><br />Second: Spike negotiating! Well, trying to. And we finally got confirmation of his dad&#39;s death. I liked that we finally got a glimpse&nbsp;of how Spike&#39;s been dealing with it, but&nbsp;to me it feels&nbsp;a bit like it&#39;s too little too late. His father being terminally ill was such an important character arc for Spike that it felt like a major letdown&nbsp;that they didn&#39;t revisit it until this ep.<br /><br />Other than that, nothing really jumped out and grabbed me, but maybe that&#39;s just because I&#39;m generally not too fond of gang/maffia plots.&nbsp;I may enjoy it more when I watch it a second time.<br /><br /><br /><br /></lj-cut>So did anyone see the promo for next week&#39;s ep?

She had just talked a guy down from a bridge and had been forced to dredge up the memory of her best friend&#39;s suicide in order to connect with him. It had shaken her a little more than she cared to admit and was rather disconcerted to find that her mind kept wandering back to the tragic event from her past. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Jules? You okay?&quot; Spike asked, his gentle voice interrupting her thoughts.<br />&nbsp;<br />She looked up at him quickly and gave him a small smile.&nbsp; &quot;Yeah.&quot; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;You did great out there with Cary.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Thanks. So did you. You should second more often.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Thanks, but I think I&#39;ll stick with bombs. Easier to negotiate,&quot; Spike said and grinned when she raised an eyebrow at him. &quot;They don&#39;t talk back.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Ah.&quot; Jules smiled again, but felt it fade quickly. Soon she found herself staring out of the window, her mind wandering once more. After a few minutes, however, she became aware that Spike was glancing at her.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;I&#39;m sorry about your friend,&quot; he said quietly.<br />&nbsp;<br />Jules dropped her gaze from the window and looked down at her gloved hands. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;What was her name?&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Jules looked up, her eyes on the car in front of them but not really seeing it. &quot;Kelly.&quot; She smiled a little to herself. &quot;I still have a picture of her in my wallet.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;I&#39;d like to see it some time,&quot; Spike said, his voice soft. &quot;How old was she when she died?&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Jules looked away. &quot;Seventeen. She was a few months younger than I was.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Must&rsquo;ve been really tough.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;It was, but-&ldquo; she glanced back at Spike and sighed. &quot;It&#39;s been eighteen years. It happened a long time ago.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Doesn&#39;t make it any less tragic.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;No, it doesn&#39;t.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Just a little easier to bear, right?&quot; Spike said, taking his eyes off the road long enough to give her a sympathetic smile.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Yeah, until you have to drag it all up again.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Now, see, that&#39;s another thing I like about bombs. You don&#39;t have to drag up any painful memories to-&quot; Spike broke off with a quiet gasp and Jules, startled, whipped her head around to look at him. The color had drained from his face and there was a sudden tightness to his jaw, but it wasn&#39;t until she noticed the stricken look in his eyes that she realized what was wrong: Lewis.<br />&nbsp;<br />Jules reached over to put a hand on Spike&#39;s arm. &quot;Spike, it&rsquo;s okay,&quot; she said, and waited until his gaze briefly met hers. &quot;Not so long ago for you, huh?&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;No,&quot; Spike agreed, his eyes vulnerable. Then he almost visibly gave himself a shake and Jules could actually see him pull himself together. He kept his eyes on the road but the pained expression on his face was chased off by his dimpled smile, even though it didn&#39;t quite reach his eyes. &quot;You know, I was supposed to make <i>you</i> feel better, not the other way around,&quot; he said.<br />&nbsp;<br />Jules gave his arm a little squeeze before she straightened, smiling. &quot;Hey, we&#39;re a team. You had my back with Cary, and now I have yours.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />The smile Spike gave her in return radiated both gratitude and relief. To her surprise, she felt her own spirits lift a little at the sight of it.<br />&nbsp;<br />They both jumped when Greg&#39;s voice crackled through their radios. <i>&quot;Spike, Jules, what&#39;s your ETA?&quot; </i><br />&nbsp;<br />Spike was the first to recover, his voice all business. &quot;Five minutes away, boss.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Jules adjusted her earpiece and sat up a little straighter. &quot;Duty calls.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Spike nodded. &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Jules was silent for a few seconds. Then she said, &ldquo;Spike?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Thanks for asking about Kelly.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Spike&#39;s cheek dimpled when he looked at her. &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;<br /></lj-cut>&nbsp;<br />"

Absolutely the best part of the ep for me! :oD<br /><br />Spike got to show off his computer skills again and Greg was once again suitably awed ;o) I&#39;m really loving the Greg/Spike moments this season.&nbsp;I think Greg&#39;s got a soft spot for Spike the size of Canada ;o)&nbsp;<br /><br />Sam questioning Ed was interesting and I can totally imagine it must&#39;ve been hard for Sam to take a step back and not be TL anymore after having been the one to make the tactical decisions for five months in Ed&#39;s absense. I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with ego, as some people have suggested, but more with the fact that it&#39;s hard to give up something that you&nbsp;enjoy doing and that makes you feel accomplished. And it&#39;s especially hard to give up control.<br /><br />Loved seeing how Spike was clearly bothered by Sam and Ed&#39;s disagreement.<br /><br />The scene between Ed and Greg at the end was really cute. Not sure whether it was scripted or not (though I&#39;m inclined to think it was) but it was a wonderful little scene. We need more friendshippy team moments like that! :o)<br /><br />ETA: Just&nbsp;remembered another great Spike line from this ep:<br />Raf: &quot;So what if it&#39;s a false alarm?&quot;<br />Spike: &quot;I dunno.

"event","So I was thinking about Blue on Blue and&nbsp;<lj-cut text=""Spoilers and speculation for 415 Blue on Blue"">was wondering what kind of incentive Spike&#39;s kidnapper&#39;s gonna use to get him to break into the police depot. Threatening to kill him wouldn&#39;t work &#39;cause I&#39;d imagine Spike would just say something like, &quot;Go ahead, then you definitely won&#39;t get your money.&quot; They could threaten him with bodily harm, which I&#39;d prefer (yeah, I know that sounds bad, but it&#39;s only for the h/c!), or they could threaten to hurt or kill someone he loves, which, unfortunately, seems more likely. I just went to check IMDb and I&#39;ll give you three guesses who&#39;s going to be in the episode.<br /><br />Yeah. Natalie.<br /><br />Soooo now I&#39;m kinda worried that it&#39;s gonna be more about Natalie than about Spike and I DO NOT WANT that to happen. I know, I shouldn&#39;t worry about an ep that hasn&#39;t even aired yet, but I can&#39;t really help it. It may very well be that she only plays a tiny part at the beginning or end of the ep -&nbsp;maybe Spike&#39;s kidnapped when they&#39;re on a date -&nbsp;but I&#39;d kind of hoped she wasn&#39;t going to be in the ep at all. I <i>really</i> hope they&#39;re not going to go the way of&nbsp;Spike and Natalie being abducted together and the bad guys hurting Natalie to get Spike to do what they want, because, well, that&#39;s been done to death for one and two, I want the team to worry about <i>Spike</i> and not about Natalie.&nbsp;But it just seems likely they will&nbsp;go that&nbsp;route as it would add another dimension to the team&#39;s angst given&nbsp;that Natalie&#39;s Sam&#39;s sister.<br /><br /></lj-cut>*siiiiiiiiiiighs* I should really stop obsessing over this ep. &nbsp;<br />"

"event","New Flashpoint ep Wild Card on&nbsp;CTV&nbsp;tonight!!! :oD<br /><br />But unfortunately there&#39;ll be a two-week break after that *grumbles*. I hate breaks between Flashpoint episodes. Loathe them in fact. Especially when it means that I&#39;m going to have to wait even longer for Blue on Blue to air (I&#39;m assuming it&#39;ll now air November 22nd instead of November 9th).&nbsp;Glah! There&#39;d better not be any more breaks before Blue on Blue airs! *eyes CTV sternly*<br /><br />At least Sergio gave us a pic to&nbsp;tide us over:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/tristen84/pic/0000gg7t/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/tristen84/pic/0000gg7t"" style=""width: 640px; height: 427px"" /></a><br /><br />What a cute pic! And really, I think I&#39;ve yet to see a pic where Sergio <i>isn&#39;t</i> smiling ;o)<br />"

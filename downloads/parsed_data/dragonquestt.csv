People are so funny, always casting judgment on one another. Why It&#39;s like a cruel part of life we, each of us, learn to deal with. I talked with a manager at work the other day, about&nbsp;several&nbsp;things, but mainly about my&nbsp;calling&nbsp;in sick. She eventually gave me an FMLA form to fill out. The topic I remember most though was about my roommate and good friend Justice. He also called in sick, many many times more than I, to have his teeth worked on. Only, he really only had his teeth worked on two times out of the week (going on two weeks) that he called out. She told me&nbsp;that&nbsp;the needs to come back to work or they&#39;re going to send him a&nbsp;notice&nbsp;that he&#39;s being fired. Now I find it funny that she says this, as he, Justice, informed me otherwise. He told me that she told him he&#39;s covered, he won&#39;t get fired.

Well I &nbsp;must not dwell on this as it is not my life, it is his, thus it is not of my concern.

I&#39;m not sure I will last much longer at this job, once you lose interest, or feel &quot;burnt out&quot; as my coworker put it, your quality of work done really falls down hill. I will sooner be fired from&nbsp;performance&nbsp;than attendance as I had originally assumed.If this were to happen, it would of course be for the best. During my time off, as well as after and before work, I have applied for other jobs. In fact I had an interview this morning at 11am. After borrowing my roommates car I left around 10:30am and arrived at the GSR and 10:45. I twas for a bowling lane attendant job. I was immediately turned off upon entering the human resources office.There were already two younger girls, appearing no older than 19, talking amongst themselves. From the clothes they were wearing it was clear they were also there for the 11am interview. I informed the IA that I was there and was directed to sit down. Shortly after, two or more&nbsp;gentlemen&nbsp;walked in. It only took a few minutes for me to lose entire interest and leave. There was not one part of my body that was&nbsp;ready&nbsp;to compete for the job I didn&#39;t really want.

On the drive back home, I took some time to think about why I left the interview. The dehumanization was one factor I thought about. Being treated like cattle when applying for a job is&nbsp;demoralizing&nbsp;and, in my opinion, unprofessional. I guess that for once in my life I would like a job where I feel needed, not herded. Is this truly a problem with our economy? A lack of job security, and less and less jobs allowing for an accumulation of experience. Most jobs require no experience which allows for very little pay. Maybe that was my reason for not staying for the interview. What will happen to someone like me? No longer able to stand society&#39;s poor cycle. I&#39;m sure soon I will find out. &lt;3"

"event","Well here I am again. Its is becoming slowly more and more difficult to find time to write in this journal. There are few updates for my life at the current moment.&nbsp;

My thoughts are still racing as they have been from the first moment I entered high school. It doesn't seem to worry me as much as it has been. The only real startling thing is that I am becoming more and more unaware of what other people are saying to me in the midst of conversation. I can muster the concentration just enough to say what it is that is on my mind, but the moment that someone begins to reply to what it is I have said, I lose complete interest and I am at a loss for what it is they are trying to say. That, I must admit, is beginning to worry me. I have taken it upon myself to look for a therapist with whom I can talk to. Hopefully someone competent enough to understand the problems I am attempting to convey. I am only worried that they will attempt to refer me to a&nbsp;psychologist&nbsp;so that I may be prescribed pills for any problems that they may diagnose me with. A very close friend of mine has began taking pills for her racing thoughts that she has had. She informed me that the pills seem to be working and that she has felt at ease the past couple of days, finally able to concentrate on one thing at a time.&nbsp;

I will say, having racing thoughts can be so utterly beneficial when it comes to doing certain things. My thoughts race faster than the average person, so I am able to come to conclusions, or reach certain intervals in conversations at a fast rate than normal. I can easily jump from one conversation to the next in my head and by the time it is my turn to speak, my mind may be on a completely different subject.&nbsp;

Well if I can steer away from the fact that I have racing thoughts for just a moment, and that my journal is a complete cluster fuck of facts about my life, I would like to talk a little about my level of depression.

Over these past couple of weeks my depression has not really sank to an all time low as it seems to have done in the past. Thoughts of suicide are drifting away from my life and I must say it feels great. I can't remember the last night that I sat awake, staring at the stucco ceiling, wondering to myself why I am still continuing to live the same dead end life that I have been. For almost a year and a half now I have been living on my own, I am worried that this is having a very devastating affect on my depression. Being alone for long periods of time can not be at all healthy for my mental state. I have allowed myself the luxury of surrounding myself with friends outside of my apartment. I am rarely ever home anymore which only makes me sad for my cat as she is at my apartment all hours of the day. Sometimes I am gone over 24 hours and she is to live alone until I come home to visit for maybe an hour before I find something else to do and leave once more. While I am not home, I do spend a lot of time with other people which is the great part. As long as I am around other people my level of depression seems to go away. I feel euphoric almost, knowing that I am surrounded by people who actually care about me and want to be around me.

For now though, I really must sleep as there is much to do in the morning before work.&nbsp;

"event","Brief recap on the past couple of weeks:&nbsp;<br /><br />I have recently found myself associating with a new group of people whom I would really like to call friends some day. It is difficult for myself to really open up to a particular person, let alone a group of people. I blame my shy personality primarily on my father and his forcing me to relocate my entire life year after year--I won't really droll on that too long, I've other things I would like to write about.<br />---<br /><br />The new group of people that I have been associating with I unfortunately do not see myself with in the near future. I find it hard to really imagine myself with any one group of people in the near or far future. Throughout the years I have found that i am really an independent person, not by choice but by nature. My father is a prime example of this. He has been married to my mother for a little over thirty years and they despise each-other ever so much. Am I assuming that such an inability to socialize is purely genetic? Quite possibly. Who am I to really make any assumptions on the matter though? I will never be a scientist on such topics. I must agree as well that any abilities lacking on such a caliber may quite possibly be a result of an isolated childhood. (I am a bit tired at this moment so a majority of this either makes very little sense, or is the most beautifully written journal thus far.)<br /><br />D&amp;D, my new obsession and new hobby. With vast requirements to utilize the imagination and forced social interaction amongst the current players, D&amp;D has to be the more healthy activity for me at this point. It would be so nice to believe that my quiet personality and lack of interest in interaction with other people is purely genetic and that is just the person I am, but that would be highly unlikely. Either I had a severely traumatizing childhood experience or I am just naturally a boring person. I have quite honestly always believed that I am simply a pensive person; I prefer to sit back and absorb all that occurs, instead of constantly running my mouth and saying whatever it is that comes to my mind I would rather remain quiet. By now pushing myself to participate in this game, creating a character that is a complete polar opposite of who I am now, I am allowing myself the chance to jump into a life in which I have always dreamed. Yes, I know, D&amp;D is a bit nerdy for my liking, but I am nerd. That is the person that I was growing up, thus that is the person that I have grown into.<br />---<br /><br />Ah...if only I had the ability to really organize my thoughts a lot better than what you see written above, but unfortunately my mind works entirely too fast for my little fingers to capture.&nbsp;<div>----</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Work has become more interesting, considering I have been working at the same place for a little over 2 years now. (Hooray work experience.) I have worked for ATT, as I can't remember if I mentioned this in my previous journal, as a customer assistant in which I walk people through (over the phone) how to fix their currently not working internet service, or how to install their new internet service with ATT. Our center hours of operation was previously (and still is for a little over another month) 5am--midnight. According to the new Area Manager, the new operations are going to change to help out the business as a whole, to 7am-11pm. This is going to drastically change how things are currently. Everyone is going to see everyone at one point in time, and there will be no more midnight shifters, which means that there is no more shift differential for any of the mangers (aw, sad face.)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>My job is a bit repetitive, and quite stressful with the constant, uncontrollable workflow. I have applied for a premise technician position (which actually pays a bit more, starting at 15 an hour) and I have already taken a trip to Sacramento to take (and passed) the technician test. The only thing that I am currently waiting for now is a call back from HR with the next step in the hiring process. Because of my applying for that position, this has been a stressful past two months. I am really worried that i may not get this new job and that I will be stuck working for ATT &nbsp;tech support for another two or three years. I really do appreciate that I have a job, but I would like more than anything to not come home every night wishing that I could end my life because everything has just become so stressful.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Back to the my work though. The current person that i actually play D&amp;D &nbsp;with works with me at ATT, starting only a month or so before I did. He is actually a really nice individual, whom I really enjoy talking to at times. Being as intelligent as he is, it can be a bit intimidating trying to explain certain things to him. Oh how I wish I was able to retain friends for a longer period than a little over a year....I find it to be a problem with myself, and not really anyone personally. It just begins to strike me that some people don't really want to talk to me anymore, or I read people incorrectly and ---- oh gosh I am ranting, clearly a sign that I need to sleep now.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I apologize for the most unorganized journal thus far, but an absolutely necessary journal still.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Goodnight...</div>"

"event","&nbsp;Well I've decided once again to try and take control of my life and really excersize like i have been trying. i have decided also that it would be a good idea to really look into moving up in the company that i am working for. The first thing on my list is to really strive for jogging every night after I get off of work, even if that means jogging around one in the morning until two in the morning. I already put in for the tech position that ATT is currently hiring for in Reno, I went and took the test. (which I passed!) now I just need to wait and hear back from HR about the position and what I will need to do next.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sorry that this journal entry seems really jumbled and if there is no flow or consistency. That is essentially how my mind has been working lately. After school let out, I have not known what to do with myself, trying to focus on the tasks at hand have become rather difficult. All the more reason that I need to take a trip to the&nbsp;doctor&nbsp;to verify that everything is okay and that there is nothing wrong with me.&nbsp;<br /><br />---<br /><br />Today at work we got to combine two of the teams here and actually work on project called the &quot;marshmallow&nbsp;challenge&quot; which was essentially something taken from TED talks,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is one of my favorite websites to go and watch videos. The idea is that you have 20 sticks of spaghetti, 2 yards of tape, 2 yards of string and a&nbsp;marshmallow. You have to try and build the tallest structure, which can of course hold the&nbsp;marshmallow&nbsp;in top without falling over. Now according to the&nbsp;speech&nbsp;given about the project, the project itself requires everyone to work together in a timely manner which requires ingenuity. There were three teams total out of the two teams that were split up, and our group of course was the only group that was not able to build a structure that was able to stand up.&nbsp;<br /><br />I quite honestly blame that failed attempt on my inability to really work with other people. All that ended up happening was me taking over and telling everyone what to do. I am no architect so of course my building structure was flawed severely. The better idea would have been to listen to my other teammates and build triangles and then structure those so that they stand more solid like. Instead we tried to build a T-P which collapsed upon trying to add the marshmallow. Hah. I did learn quite a bit from this project, which I must thank my manager for. It was a quiet reminder that I am not really a team leader, and that it will really be a long time before I will be able to work with other people. Would it be valid to blame my inability to work with other people on the fact that I moved so often when I was younger? That would certainly explain why I am so shy.&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;</div><div>Well this is a rather unorganized journal entry, and for that I apologize, there is really nothing more that I can think to add at this point in time...<br />&nbsp;</div>"

There have been times that I have lost any will to continue on with certain classes, as I'm sure we all have at one time or another, but I have not allowed myself to give up all hope entirely. i must continue to find inspiration to remain focused on my studies. Education is the most important thing in this world. The amount of information available is overwhelming and there are times I find myself staring at the class sheet unable to decide the next class to take for the upcoming semester.

I've begun to pay more attention to the complexity with which we as humans choose to live our lives. Are we pressured in any way to exist within society? Maybe even influenced? The dalail lama was wise in saying ""there is no need for temples, no need for complicated philosophies. My brain and heart are my temples. My philosophy is kindness."" Do we really require anymore from life than what it has already given us?

I am reminded each day that I am no more than a small cog in the machine we call humanity. It is my works ability to dehumanize which upsets me. My job which I show up to ontime every day, reminds me of the complexity we humans strive to live by. Is life so complicated that we must apply rules and regulations? If we are really a society and united as one, why am I treated like a number and not a name? I am only ranting of course....there are no answers to these questions....to which I am aware of. It will take years of contemplation before I understand this world and what it is really about.

"event","Recently I was introduced to the idea of going to New York for a week. For a friend's 21st birthday. I was very over joyous for this trip. It is been discovered that building something up in your mind too much can lead to a greater&nbsp;disappointment&nbsp;&nbsp;int he long run if that something doesn't go through as planned. Well I have just discovered that I don't actually have money to pay for this ticket. 

I feel awfully terrible for making my friend wait for my next paycheck just so that we can buy the tickets together. The longer that we wait the more the tickets will cost us out of pocket, and that means the less spending money my friend will have for her 21st birthday. The most important thing to me is that I have enough money for grocery shopping and bills. I had to make the very difficult decision of telling my friend that unfortunately in these tough times, even though I recently got my taxes back and my back pay plus the bonus from my job, I have no money to pay for the trip of the ticket.
 
I am not sure why this utterly depresses. It makes me rethink all of the expenses I have gone through in these past couple of months.&nbsp;

&quot;If I went to sushi less often and saved more money....&quot;
&quot;Maybe if I didn't give my father that money to pay for his truck...&quot;
&quot;I should have saved that money instead of loaning it to my mother...&quot;

Of course that would be rather silly of my to dwell on the past as these things have already come and gone. The most important thing in life has to be the present, not the past or future. The only time that is ever going to matter, no matter who you are, is the present. I need to begin to diminish the level of stress that i have been putting myself through. It is a very tough course and I can longer trek it. There is only so much stress I can take before it begins to take its toll and eventually take what's left of my life.

-----

I would like to break off from that point, and start a new topic while I am still here.'

School has been wonderful this past week! I am more then over joyed that I have started college, and I know in the future I will most definitely not regret this. I am taking anthropology, sociology, and english (preperatory). My english class is the only class that I am really embarassed to take. The fact that I placed into it is a little embarassing in itself. I have made it my goal to prove to my teacher that I do not belong in this class and that I have more than every right to be in the first level college english class. I need to be able to apply myself, I don't want to spend an entire semester simply reviewing what I learned in high school.

I don't really find myself to be the bragging type, but I would like to think of myself as a very well read person. I try to pick up as many books as I can whenever I go to Barnes and Noble. I always get this over excited feeling in the pit of my stomach whenever I enter that store. But that's beside the point.

My other classes are going rather well, as &nbsp;I am participating more than I usually do in my previous high school classes. There are so many goals I have set for myself this semester, and I plan to meet every single one.&nbsp;"

"event","Sitting here on a friend's macbook, I figure that I should at least post an entry instead of wasting time on facebook.

The other day (around 2 days ago) , I had my wisdom teeth removed. I am sitting here, of course, a little loopy on percoset, so forgive any bizarre statements or misspellings.

The surgery went quite well, to be perfectly honest. I&nbsp;was most of all afraid that after the surgery, I would have a sore mouth, as all of my friends have informed me that this surgery or operation, is one of the most painful things to be done in your lifetime. I don't really agree for the most part. It is more of a miserable process than a painful one in my honest opinion. I have somehow managed, though, to get two days off from work so that I can rest, before I have to go back to taking calls for ATT. Talking is most certainly the last thing on my mind at the moment.

I would also like to step back a moment, and explain what it is I mean by a miserable experience if you are not sure yourself...every morning I wake up I have a dry mouth because my jaw hurts enough to keep me from closing my mouth completely. Brushing my teeth has become somewhat of a challenge each and every day, and me being the hygienically inclined person that I&nbsp;am, prefer to brush my teeth at least twice a day. I have spent the past couple of days reading, and trying to keep in touch with the people in my life who matter.

This whole process should, hopefully, be no longer than 2 weeks. I am not sure if I can really stand the throbbing every morning when I wake up. 

---

Apart from my wisdom teeth operation, my life is quite droll really.

I still spend part of my day thinking about how lonely I am, and how I wish so badly to find the right person. It plagues my mind, and I'm quite frankly tired of it. I have always viewed relationships as a sign of weakness in a personality. To me, I feel that if you need someone in your life, to be there for you every moment of the day, then are not truly capable of coping with life alone, which is how we are brought into, and brought out of this world, alone. That of course, is just an opinion, and I know that in one point in my life, that will all change, and I will find the person who will make me smile every minute of the day, but until that day, I can only look down on love and shake my head."

Being a man who rarely goes out on a blind date, I would have to say today is a prime example as to why it will never happen again. I feel as though there is something about me: whether it be my&nbsp;demeanor, my intelligence, my philosophy, or my looks alone...I can't quite be sure, but it seems to push any and every man away that I fall for. Although...I suppose to say &quot;fall for&quot; is a little exaggerative, as I have never really feel the common &quot;love&quot; for someone other then a family member simply out of compassion for them being my family.&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear the worst for my love life today....and several years from now.

As life continues to drag on...as though I have no motivation for the future...consideration in quitting my job becomes more and more surreal. My &nbsp;job seems to be the only mentally framed requirement that is keeping me from an education. I have built it up in my mind that living with my parents is not an option, and paying for school through scholarships and grants is simply impossible. These facts that I have continued to tell myself over and over are not facts, absolutely not facts. They are&nbsp;inviable&nbsp;pieces of information that I have imprinted in my mind in order to make my life more difficult. It is things such as these that I need to eliminate from my mental state of being, so that I may continue on with my life, and further my education as I so greatly wish I could do.

"event","I feel as though lately my philosophical conversations seem to happen more often than usual. I have come to the conclusion that life is only as good as the people you are willing to let influence you. 

```

Recently I have come around to starting college. Furthering my education was the best choice that has been made in my life in a few years. I feel as though life is all about gaining as much knowledge as you are capable of retaining. I am only capable of taking one college class at this point in time. My concentration is broken between work, school, and striving towards my drivers license. I would really like appreciate the joy of independence from my family. As terrible as this statement is to make, my family has been more of a burden to me than they ever have before ever since I have moved out and began to rent my own studio apartment. My independence is limited to how often I have to grocery shop using their car, and how often I need their car to get to work. There is this small glimmer of light inside my mind that knows the very moment I am able to obtain my drivers license and purchase a car, my parents time spent in my life will decrease. It sounds utterly awful, this I know. I will always carry with me the looks, habits, and habitual trates that I have inherited from my mother and father, but carrying around the knowledge that I have gone through life with less burdon, and with less stress then they have brought upon themselves will bring me tremendous joy.

Although...that is not the primary purpose of this post. I would much rather not ramble on about my parents and the sad role they have begun to play in my life just recently.

This post is to ask myself a few questions that I may ponder about later in life when I read over this once again. 

My yearning for eduaction is a questionable desire....I fear that the only reason I really feel the urge to further my education is because of the basic human need to follow the herd. To be just like everyone else. It seems as though there is a sense of security in knowing that I am along side the rest of my generation. It is almost as though if I were to make a mistake in my life, it would somehow be reassuring to know that there is always go ing to be someone out there making the same mistake. I will continue to wonder how that is in the least bit reassuring...

We as humans seem to bring upon ourselves the stress that we feel throughout our existence. We set far off goals, and then spend our entire life trying to reach this goal. I know the moment that I reach one goal, there is another goal ready for me to obtain. I do not want to spend my life trying to reach these goals....that seems like a meaningless way to exist. Why burden yourself with these minute goals that have been set here before you? If we as humans were able to exist without goals, would there be perserverence to obtain the unobtainable in this life? 

There are so many thoughts that plague my mind, but I will never have the time to capture them all. It is as though I am swimming in a sea of curiosity for this world. The moment that I finally realize what it is I am here to do....death will fall upon me. There most certainly should be better ways to spend my time then bothering myself with questions about reality and the world that surrounds me. 

I will have to finish this post at a later time...my thoughts are too jumbled and I can't focus on an empty stomach....

If I can keep myself from darting into a relationship, it will presumptively lead to a something more than it has been. With all the stress of money-involved problems, i just can't focus. Gosh golly gee, life is supposed to be fabulous for me, not atrocious. how awful. I need to stop waiting for love to find me."

Perhaps what I need more than ever right now; more than coffee, new shoes, scarves, or pants, is an education. I have waited so long to further my education, and move on in my life that I feel any knowledge accumulated in the passed couple of years has somewhat diminished behind the massive wall of procrastination. After stopping by the community college in Reno, and taking the &quot;accuplacer&quot; (just as the name implies, it informs you what class will best suite your mental ability), I have officially been deemed hopeless. If there is any one person on the face of this planet who could have quite possibly scored lower than me, step forth now or forever hold your peace.&nbsp;

I have spent the past few nights just thinking to myself. I have to decide whether or not spending time with ""him"", is a waste of my time, or if I am actually going to get something worth while out of the entire situation. I know that I have wasted time with people before, hoping for the best. Hoping that maybe one day we would turn out to be the most adorable thing to hit Reno since Ashlee Stone, but that just hasn't happened yet. I grow more and more impatient. Will I ever find the right person? I'm sure that is what everyone wastes their time wondering. I just wonder if I have become the very thing that I used to hate ever so much. Have I become a selfish loser who will only go for the gold? ""He"" is the sweetest man, but there is something about this person that I find absolutely repulsive but I just can't seem to place it.

Maybe it's the utter attraction and admiration ""he"" has for me. Or maybe...maybe I am just too scared to have a true commitment with someone, so therefore I have become better and pushing someone away, rather than pulling them as close as I can. I feel as though I have built up walls in the past few years, around the people that I love. I have built walls, and whoever tries to get close to me, has to climb over these walls, and by the time they get close enough to me, they tire of climbing these walls and leave. 

I want to change, I really do. But what can I do at this stand point? I have never needed anyone's help more than I do right now. But who do I reach out to for help? I am alone. I have no one."

I was so quiet, timid, and non responsive to the outside world. I don't know this person I've become. I am open about my feelings to just about everyone, the way I dress is completely untrue to my inner personality. It's almost like I was born blue and I'm trying to merge into purple. I shouldn't pretend to be something that I am clearly not. This only gets me into the situation of creating friends I would normally never have. 
----
Of course that is only one of the many problems I seem to be experiencing these days.
---

I almost feel as though me not being completely open to my parents, is keeping me from being who I TRUELY want to be, need to be, even when I'm not around them. I feel barred in even when my parents are nowhere near me. I am completely independent and yet I have no control over how I act. I wish that for once in my life, I could finally be free, and soar through the air like everyone around me. I wish I could be the person I dream of becoming. The person that helps me sleep at night, that keeps me from crying, even through the toughest of times. I wish that I could be that person, I wish I could somehow find the power to pull that person out, and stop hiding him from the rest of the world. I know, just KNOW if I can do that, then I will truely find the happiness I have dreamt of my entire life.

Sitting here drinking this vanilla late isn't helping much at all. I have yet to sleep all night, and it's almost 7 in the morning. Oh my. I am absolutely lucky that there is no work today. Am I scared to be myself around people? What am I scared of? Their criticism? Their jokes? Am I scared that I will lose a friend I could've won any other way? Why am I so scared of these things? I don't understand! I wish I could find some sort of help through all of this, but this is surely something that I must overcome on my own....life is only so hard when it needs to be.

If someone really wants to be my friend, or something more, they shouldn't put such a big cloud over my life, I need some sunlight to live. Freedom isn't earned, it's something you were born with, and every living person born in the united states has some. I have never been this upset before, I wonder if maybe I go for another walk I will calm down? I can't even step out of the house without running into someone I don't want to see at the moment. 

Only a few more days before I can go drown my life back into my work, and forget about everything else around me. It's so absolutely depressing to even think that my life is going to continue on in this endless spiral towards the broken white wall at the end of the hallway. I was considering saving up just enough money and moving to washington to live with my best friend, but where would that leave me in life, I would be in the same spot I am now, the only difference would be that I'm two states up, and no money to do anything with. I am not even considering it anymore, I am going to do it. 

In less than 6 months, I will be out of this state, and this city, and on with my life. I can't sit here and wait around for the next exciting thing to happen in my life, I need something to happen now, before what little is left of my sanity explodes into a giant ball of fire infront of all the people who pretend they know and love me like I was someone they could rely on. 

Who am I kidding. Most of the journal entrys turn out to be long rants about I don't even know what, my mind races so fast that sometimes I just can't keep up, even with the speed that I type at. 

I will leave this city, and free my mind from all this chaos drama, I will find something better to do with my life than just sit here and wish that I was somewhere else like the rest of the world. I'm not a man of dreams, but actions, I can't sit around and think about something. If I do then I will lose my mind, I need to find something to do to occupy myself for the rest of the day now.

She surprised me the next day by showing up at my house, already there, and I told her that I didn't want to go back with her, I can't remember why. But I felt very strongly that I didn't want to go back with her. I think it had something to do with the fact that she was going to ""roll"" with her friends. That, and I don't really feel the same way for katie that she does for me.

She calls me her ""best friend"" constantly, but I don't think that she's really that much of a friend to me, she can be really mean. Blah...I don't know. So I decided that I was going to go to the rave instead of go back to dan's place, which is where katie wanted me to go with her, he lives right by her I guess. 

So I get to the rave, and katie finds me there in line, and she won't leave because I don't want to go with her, she was trying to convince me, and the two people that came with me were trying to peer pressure me into going, but I didn't want to leave, it was really bugging me. So she got pissed off at me, but I didn't care, I stayed at the rave. Besides it was my friend Rebecca's first rave, and she was already inside. I didn't want to leave here there, so I stayed.

Those are the only two things that flashed through my mind before the pill sank to my stomach and began to do what it was made to do. It only took me by surprise while I was dancing as it hit me. I could hear the dj's voice suddenly become something more than a voice, but a savior, a calling, something that I couldn't stop listening to, he suddenly sounded so interesting. 

The three people around me only looked in awe as they realized that mine had hit me faster than theirs had.

From that moment, the fear of dying had left my mind. I no longer cared about such things as death and injury, I only cared to dance, and to feel. I felt like a boat on the open water, except there were waves this time, waves bigger than any one person could imagine. I sat and drifted upon these waves, and let them take me wherever it was we were going. It was only when I fell off the wave that I realized something terrible was happening.

We were sitting on a couch in the back when I realized where I was, and it scared me that I couldn't remember how I had gotten myself over to that couch. Had I passed out and just now woken up? Or had I simply walked over and sat down, and truly just not remembered I had done that? These things started to scare me, and as I sat there scared, and depressed, I realized that it was coming down, and the mere fact that this thing could take control of my emotions so easily scared me even more. I couldn't help but sit up a little more and stop listening to what it was that was going on around me. I couldn't tell where I was anymore, suddenly it just didn't matter. 

I had been sitting alone for some time now and had only just now begun to realize that I was alone. All of my friends had left me, I was the only one left in the place called Bliss. The object of affection had suddenly worn off, and I was alone, and tired, and confused. I opened my eyes again only to realize that I wasn't alone, there were people around me, and I was perfectly okay. I turned to the kid next to me, I was holding his hand but I hadn't any idea who he was. I asked him his name and he gave me a puzzled look, ""Joey"", I only sat and stared for what felt like years at him, and then without a word turned back forward to  look at the dance floor full of people.

This had been an interesting day, only to get worse as time had gone on. The boat on the water was crashing around, dropping and rising on the waves, and I happened to be the captain...ready to go down with  his ship at any moment..."

"event","I've been contemplating lately, whether doing what I've been doing is okay. I was looking into it, and realized that maybe I should slow down, back up, take a few pictures, and move on with my life for a little, I can go back to doing all that stuff later. :)

"event","Hah, so guess what? Derek just got a new lip ring a couple weeks ago, and I just switched it out for a spiral ring, and I can't tell if it  hurts like this because it's retarded, or because I just need to get used to it. I can't drink anything because it hurts, and I can't eat really, cause it hurts when I touch it. Brushing my teeth hurts too. people tell me tojust get rid of my lip ri ng, but i refuse to, its something i really want, im going to give it more time before i finally get rid of it"

"event","So it's been quite a while since I've posted in here, lets start things off.

I first just want to ask; Have I really stooped so low down that I could go after someone as common as him? I remember that I used to live my whole life telling myself that if there was one person I would not be with on Earth it would be someone so changeable by society. I feel like I have become so desperate to be held that I would turn to someone that doesn't really even matter to me. I  need to just take a breathe and slow down, take my time, look at the sites as I pass them.

Work first, no play. Right? I should be more worried about living my life, not worried about where my life is going to be heading 20 years down the road. I have my whole life to go to college, and here I am, sitting here worrying about going right now, right away, right during the the time that my parents are having the worst financial problem in the world. Hah. I'm such a crazy person.

Also, I think that I need to start setting out and doing more things for myself. The other day I went for a walk, because I didn't want to be inside, but it was so cold outside that if I had stayed out any longer I felt that I would have died. Ugh, I just wish that life was easier on me, and that I had more people there who really cared about me you know? More people who would be willing to spend more time with me, instead of worrying about going to college and there jobs. God that sounds so selfish, yet, here I am saying it just because I know that deep down inside, no matter how selfish it may sound, that's how I really feel.

Fuck I can't go to college right now, I can't afford it. My friends keep telling me that I don't have to pay the money back until later, that I can get the loan now and do my classes. I'm thinking to myself, I don't even know what it is that I want to be, and here I am going to college. I think that that is an incredible waste of money. Also, the college is trying to tell me what classes I should spend my money on, it's like, I'll take the classes that I want, and spend my money on the classes that I need thank you. 

----

On another note. I was so worried a few nights ago after the incident with that faggot Brandon, if I would ever find someone out there who really cares, and if I did find that person, how would  I know that that person is the right person? Well I stopped myself, calmed down, and realized that I had completely forgot how I used to look at things in life, how I used to be happy even on the downest of days. I am a better person now of course, I remembered how I felt all the time, and that's why so many people used to like me, because I was never a down person, and I was never as retarded as I am now. I won't be doing the things that I have been doing, just to make other people happy, no, drugs aren't for me kids, they're bad for you. That's for sure.

"event","So, just speaking my mind here. I just broke up with someone I really just started going out with, and I felt horrible for it, but I mean honestly I didn't really know what I was feeling for this person at the time, and I realized that what I was feeling wasn't love, so I had to tell this person, and they said that they could sort of tell, so it was okay. But our friendship has sort of changed, they can say that it hasn't but the joking and everything has changed. He's just mean to me now but he says that he's joking, but I mean, I hear that way too often to even care anymore. The one reason that I really liked this person was because he was super nice to me, but  now he's not, now he's just an asshole. I don't even know what to think anymore, I think that I am officially done with people, I say that now hoping that someone will come along out of nowhere, but I know that that won't happen. Fuck, I don't know what to think anymore...I should probably just stop, because it has gotten me nowhere. I am seriously considering moving to Oregon with Anti and just living there, it would be a life away from the life that I have created here, something that I wish I could give up really. I need someone to talk to who can walk me through this, I feel totally lost, I need someone...anyone...but there never is someone, because I have found that my friends are so completely busy with their lives, and that's cool, I guess I'm the same way, I just wish I had one person who was there for me...just one person....this is not enough...."

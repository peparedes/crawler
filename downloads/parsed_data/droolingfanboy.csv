She was in the living room and noticed that there was a squirrel on the window ledge. then she looked over and saw that there was another one hanging from the screen. The first one suddenly jumped up and started ""Humping""(moms own words) the one hanging from the screen. when he was finished he jumped down apparently to have a cigarette. Keep in mind the whole transaction occured while one was clinging o a piece of nylon mesh suspended several feet from the ground and the other was clinging to her. Squirrels just wanna have fu-uunn."

O.K. enough of that. so Christmas happened, it wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either. I got good stuff. new sheets, a new table lamp and an ott lite with a magnifier for painting miniatures and the like. I wish it came with some motivation but alas... 
    The best part of christmas was the fact we didn't have to run willy nilly from one family gathering to the next.Ususally we spend the eve w/ both sides of the family who unfortunately choose to schedule their merry making at the same time.  

    This year since Dad had to work we skipped his side. This no doubt caused some hard feelings but frak them they can take it. We risked life and limb for years getting from one place to the other since invariably ol'mom nature whistles up a blizzard on the evening of the 24th.

    New years was almost non existant. i had invitations to two different friends but chose to stay home and watch the 4 disaster movies i got from netflix instead. My friend Tom came over for a little while and we ate pizza and drank PBR while watching criminal minds. 

   Then I called my friend Kelly, who is technically still married to my friend James even though he left her to go shack up with some girl in Jackson and get her pregnant. That is a whole different story, but suffice it to say she called because he was trying to talk her into getting back together, mainly because girl #2 had just thrown him out, although she did let him back.


   Anyway we talked for a while them emailed for a while and then it was midnight and I watched the sad remains of Dick clark and went to be after consuming a whole bottle of really cheap sparkling wine (andre strawberry fresa, it was dreadful but they had no cold duck which is my traditional poison of choice.)

     On New years day I had dinner at my aunt's house and we watched Michigan state loose and penn state get whomped and i dozed off on her couch and then went home. all in all i would pronounce the holidays satisfactory, Especailly since by burning a few vaction days i have only had to work 5 out of the last 14 days. So, in closing, a belated happy hollidays to all."

    It has a voice prompt system to tell you when it need assistance, but other than that it just goes on its merry way ricocheting off the furniture and brushing away the surface dirt. Coolest of all when it starts its cycle, backing up from the charging dock it has a little beep beep beep back up alarm like a tiny delivery truck. Too cute.

    Yesterday's cleaning also included a sighting of that most rare of all indoor wildlife, the Spooky. Spooky is one of moms brother and sister cat pairing. both of them are fairly aloof to non residents of the house but spooky is down right anti-social. not a bad cat per se just, well spooky.

    I came upstairs to do the bathroom and he jumped down fron the railing where he had been lounging and regarded me for a moment and then growled at me. I made a few vain attempts at making friends but he really has to be in the mood for it.

     So alas once again we were unsuccessful in our attempts to gain the trust of the wild Spooky. we'll see you next time on mutual of Omaha's wild Kitties."

At this point I would welcome being thrown into said pit as being digested slowly over a thousand years is preferable to another 2 month of campaigning. I honestly don't think i can vote for either of these guys. and its not the lack of experience on Obama's part. I think someone who isn't a Washington insider could be advantageous to us all. My biggest fear is that he will, to quote a west wing episode ""drive us to the middle and stay there. That is to say that he will be too afraid of offending anyone to make any real changes. Hillary wouldn't have had that problem. McCain is a republican, that's reason enough for me not to vote for him. One of my friends said something about sarah Palin ""sticking to her conservative values"" what exactly does that mean? I'm not a liberal by any means but it doesn't seem to me like the conservatives value much of anything other than short term gains for the upper 5% of society. i am sorely tempted to write in mayonnaise for president as my friends at work and I have been discussing. at least it has some value as a condiment.

    My great uncle was in the great 1937 sit down strike in Flint MI. these guys took a great risk to get the right to bargain for a decent wage. The big production companies are screwing the little guys in the writers guild out of a fair share of royalties on DVD sales. Not quite the same but close enough.

THe new Jeff Goldbloom show where he hallucinates about the dead people is pretty cool but I am afraid they will have a hard time keeping up the premise for too long. fortunately the crime drama tends to be more durable than the sitcom which the networks seem to change out once a week. Apart from that about the only new first run show i enjoy any more is Battlestar Galactica. The Office is cool but I almost never get to watch it because I have to work thursday nights virtually without exception, this also leaves me out of Scrubs but I can watch the re runs on comedy central.  I guess the point, if there is one is that the networks should make more procedural crime dramas, hopefully they will squeeze out the vile disgusting reality crap and make T.V safe for people of nominal I.Q.s again"

"event","So I was driving home the other day with my fish dinner from LJS when I spotted an interesting license plate number. A little background, i take inordinate pleasure in spotting plate number/letter combo's that have dirty implications. Even ones that suggest the possibility that another plate later in the series might be naughty. For example a plate with the letters BEG and numbers 462 offers the possibility that somewhere in the great state of michigan there is a person driving around with the plate BEG 469.(Oh yes, PLEASE!!! really not going to get taken up now!)So the other night I saw a plate which bore the numbers 7ftK00. On michigan plates the zero looks the same as the letter ""O"" so theoretically there is a plate out there the proudly proclaims 7ft POO, actually there could be a series of 1ft to 9ft out there. This makes me happy to a degree which is worrisome."

"event","So I spent the weekend with my friends Kellie and James being Best man at their wedding. Simultaneously my friend Amanda got married(justice of the peace w/ no reception)Sadly due to bad timing I couldnt attend both ceremonies. Originally Amanda and Tom were planning to get hitched on thursday, but because of the holiday they had to wait until friday, at which time I was racing around the back country of Gratiot county getting tuxedos, helping get the hall ready and rehearsing the ceremony in hopes of staving off a major nuptial faux pas. The wedding went off without a hitch everything was beautiful and I managed not to cry too much.( I am such a girl when it comes to these kinds of things. There was no alcohol at the reception and yet we all stilkl had a good time. For reasons I still can't full explain I carried James' sister Lisa,the Maid of Honor, into the hall in my arms. (Kellie's brother Chris carried his girlfriend over his shoulder like a firefighter so I guess it was peer pressure.)Lisa is a petite girl and is smokin' hot but she's engaged to a guy she's never met in person before who is currently stationed in Alaska. Anyway the whole experience was great, except for the fact that now that they are wed James and Kellie are moving to Wyoming. They say that they're coming back, in fact they promised me they would but I have serious abandonment issues so I'm having a hard time with that.I got them a phone for their wedding gift so I think they will get the hint that I want them to stay in touch. Oh and by the way even though the reception was dry we still managed to get a little tipsy. once the party broke up at the hall we went to a little redneck bar and got hammered and sang Karaoke. A fitting end to the day."

It also notes that in the middle ages young men who had little work to do, the harvest being in by now went from door to door singing threatening songs to coerce friends and neighbors into giving them food and drink. this is the beginning of the tradition known as ""wassailing"".
So I don't feel quite as bad about current crass commercailism because at least it doesn't include extortion.

"event","So Black Friday has come and gone without significant damage to my soul or self respect. I really don't look forward to the day after thanksgiving since I work in retail. I don't think anybody really does look forward to it. I sincerely hope they regard it as a necessity to gotten over with. On CNN or msnbc or one of the other money worshiping networks the other day I saw a reporter saying that people see christmas gift purchases as neccessary ratther than optional. I feel that way too, I am ashamed to admit due largely to the guilt I know I'll have if I don't produce copious gifts on Dec. 25 to celebrate how jesus came to save Wall-mart. 
    the retailer I work for (I wont mention the name but it rhymes with ""Gears"") likes to use the word mandatory in conjunction with a lot of the unreasonable expectations they place on us at this time of year. I work on a commission basis, if you don't sell you don't eat. The store mangement has been pulling a lot of, You have to do this extra task, crap lately and using the ""M"" word in association with it. Now, correct me if I'm wrong but isn't compelling someone to do something essentially without pay against the law? My great great great grandfather fought in a war about that particular isssue. anyway if you haven't guessed I'm ticked about that. 
    It probably doesnt help that I am missing my friend Amanda who ran away to Holland to get knocked up by a guy who, under other circumstances I would probably be friends with.Or that my friend James announced he was moving to Wyoming, apparently to be a cowboy. But the real center of all this is that , no matter how I try I can't reproduce the feeling I got at this time of year when I was younger. I know we idealize the past but it just seems that life at this time of year didn't seem to SUCK so bad when I was less than say thirteen. 
 anyway, I was thinking of sleeping through the rest of the holidays but people talked me out of it. Woe unto them if this year sucks just as much as previously."

The number one contender for my time are people who may give me something such as money, food, candy, beer or sexual favors (sadly far too little of the last one in recent times.)
Next are the ones who are doing something I want to do. for example my gaming friends. After that are people who are doing things I don't want to do but I feel obligated to so I participate to asuage guilt.

A.weird dreams. I have been taking naps in between job A ath the loacal cider mill/bakery and job B at Sears. The quality of dreams is quite bizzare when they happen at all. I dreamed a rather complex plot to a Star Trek DS 9 episode involving quark wanting to get a printing press to print money. Then I dreamed my grandmother, who has been gone for over a decade now had taken in one of my co workers at Sears as a border.
B. Video game tournaments signal the end of society. Look in revalations, its there I tells Ya. Actually, its not, but when people can win 50 grand for playing age of empires can the end be far from nigh? I Have never made 50 grand doing any of the things that I vhave done. Not in a year's time anyway. Yeah sure I'm jealous but it doesn't make it right. 
C.Grandpa-isms. My maternal grandfather had a rather colorful mode of speach. He was an intelligent, litterate man and was knowledgeable in a number of areas. He, however had quite a short temper and tended to voice his opinion in rather picturesque ways. My favorite phrases of his were as follows (as regards something dropped on the floor ""it O.K. don't pick it up i'll just find it later with my bare feet."" (when something he didn't want to watch was announced as ""coming up next"")""Not on My T.V."" When he thought something was useless he would say it was""not worth the powder it would take to blow it to hell""
He reffered to the Beatles as whamity bang music and he would often say he couldn't set something down becase every flat surface in the place was covered."

I worked on the the back yard today. I cleared out the leaves which collected in the window wells and around the screened in porch. The work revealed many surprises. A race of hydrostone turtles once thought to be extinct, the elaborate system of wiring left by a previous civilization to power small garden lights and most significantly the tender shoots of the violets which will soon spead a thick green robe over the ground surrounding the back porch. It was somewhat like archeology. The plan for the near future is to dig out, then grade and level the area next to the porch and place conctete pavers to make a patio. then i think Mom may finally give in to the pressure i have been exerting to build a water feature in the front yard.

(my state is the only one in the union that you can show where you come from just by holding up your hand and pointing I grew up in a town that was near the webbing in between the thumb and forefinger.) Anyway some hunters spotted this critter about a year ago. since hunters in michigan drink a lot there was scepticism at first but they produced a significant quantity of video some of it very close up. i assume they used a hidden camera or a godly zoom lens because you just don't get that close to a wolverine. They are not cuddly!! take my word on this. gulo gulo would just as soon rip your eyes out as look at ya. However the uproar that this ONE wolverine has caused is fairly amusing. Yeah they are fierce and ill tempered and they can threaten poultry and livestock but this is one animal. There was a special report on one of the local news programs that purported to speculate about whether or not to kill the thing! Its one bloody wolverine guys,slow news day?? Now I could see if it was some sort of wolverine terrorist cell with tiny weapons of mass distruction, but the evidence presented so far suggests only one animal. coyotes walk the streets in most residential neighborhoods in michigan after dark but the White House hasn't placed them in an axis of evil with bears and stoats. Any way the point of this is that we should embrace this creature (not litteraly) since it is the return of a species long thought to be vanished from the area and not try to ethnically cleanse it."

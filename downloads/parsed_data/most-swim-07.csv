"event","whoa update time.

yesterday was the busiest day of my life.

district swim meet at the rockwall Y. did really well.. i'm going to regionals for my 100 backstroke. :-D. 

left the meet, and went to the hair place. me and katelyn got our hair done, and ate taco bell. and then we went back to my house, and went up to albertsons to buy cameras, and killed like, 45 minutes there playing in the toy aisle. we're so raw. then we came home, got dressed and everything, and took pictures. tori got here, and we took more pictures.. and then we went to winter ball!!! it was soo fun. it seemed really short though. and everyone looked sooo pretty. :-D. i got alot of compliments on my dress, which is always fun. so we all went and danced the night away. i ended up dancing with holden, and cody, and carter, and andrew for like, 2 seconds. and of course, with all my lovely girls. all in all, i had an AMAZING time. 
ended back up at my house, and we ((me, katelyn, and tori)) just hung out and ate pizza and talked. it was a really fun night. we ended up crashing at like, midnight or so.

woke up this morning at 10, and just laid around watching comedy central all day. eventually, katelyn and tori left, and now i'm about to go take the longest bubble bath of my life to try to get un-sore and start homework. boo. 

later, loves!"

"event","okay. first update of the year, guys.

looking back on 2005, there are a few things that stick out to me. my dad's accident, my family issues, my amazing friends, my relationship with carter, an amazing summer, my hospital incident, and the start of one of the hardest school years of my life. even though some of those things really sucked, they've all helped me to grow and mature and become a better person.

dad's accident: taught me to value every moment with my family and friends, because you never know when that will be taken away from you. he was so close to dying, and that scares me, and its has definately taught me to appreciate every moment spent with him-and everyone else.
family issues: yeah, those really suck. the fighting, the stress, and all that jazz. its pretty terrible. but, it's helped me to speak my mind, and tell them the truth about how i feel about everything, which is something i never had the courage to do before.
amazing friends: wow. you guys kept me strong throughout this rough year. i wanna thank EVERYBODY who was there for me through this year. you all mean the world to me. and yeah, i've lost a copule really good friends, and gained a couple more. i miss the old ones, but love the new ones. 
carter: wow. where can i even start? such a stressful but utterly amazing time. you still seriously mean the world to me, and you've helped me through so much, and still help me to this day. even though we've said we hated each other, we both know we really don't. i can't think you enough for all that you've done for me.
summer: freaking rocked. and thats all i have to say about that.
my hospital incident: definately taught me not to overload myself and try too hard to make everyone happy. also taught me that some people are gonna talk crap about you,even though its totally not true. even though it was like, the scariest thing thats ever happened to me, it still had some positive influences, right?
and this school year: has wiped.me.out. but hey, its definately preparing me for college, right? and believe it or not, senior year is just around the corner.

even though alot of this stuff has sucked and upset me, its all turned out to be okay. and 2006 is gonna be an amazing year. with that in mind..

RESOLUTIONS!!
-eat healthier.
-exercise more (and i'm actually gonna do it this time. lol)
-swim harder
-study harder/get better grades
-become genuinely happy with myself.
and goals
-pick a college, once and for all.
-find out what i wanna do with my life
-get into modeling (i don't care what you say, it's always been something i've wanted to do.)
-not let things bother me or people walk all over me.
-actually keep my new years resolutions.

2006 is gonna be better. i can feel it.

que sera, sera...right?"

"event","its really hard to believe that today is the one year anniversary of my dad's accident. one year ago today, life at the jones' changed forever. 

one year ago today, i was sitting in the hair place with sara, getting my hair cut, when my phone rings and my mom says we have to go to the hospital, cause my dad fell and broke his wrist. i wasn't too worried about it; he had broken things before, and from all indications, we didn't think it was serious. so we drive to st. paul, and finally find him, and begin to realize how serious things really were. he was lying on a backboard, strapped down, with a neck brace on. they had an ace bandage on it with a splint to keep it in place, and took it off to take x-rays, and it was so bad i passed out. literally out cold on the floor. then they come in and tell us he broke his hip too, and they'd have to transfer him to parkland because they weren't equipped for the stuff that needed to be done. and thus began the ten days at parkland, the surgeries, and the therapy that have continued on to today, one year later. and things haven't gotten any better, they've only gotten worse. 

its just really hard to believe that one year ago today, i was just a normal 15 year old teenaged girl, sitting in the hair place, getting a haircut, talking to my best friend, dreading practice the next day,  and thinking about the new years party i was going to have that weekend and hoping i would get to talk to carter that day. its just hard to believe that so much has happened in a year."

You hardly ever read this, but:

I miss you.

I miss just talking to you, and being around you.

I don't even miss dating you at all. This isn't about that.

I just miss being your friend.

And all I ask is that we can have that back.

Because you mean the world to me, and I don't know what I'd do without you.

Just please...can we work this out?

"event","Real update time, maybe?

Yes. I think so.

Well, let's see. School is finally starting to wind down a little bit. And by a little bit, I mean a very little bit. Since next week is final week, there's the usual rush-to-get-everything-in-to-bring-grades-up thing. And for once, I'm joining in on the rush. I'm not failing anything, but I'm really tired of C's. So I've been rushing around trying to make 100's on everything we've done since like, last week sometime. I'm so ready for Christmas break, it's unreal.

Well, yesterday it was all sleeting and everyone got all excited because it was supposed to snow. And it actually did snow for like, 2 minutes during 2nd period, and then it went away. So today since the roads were all icy and what not, no school. Good thing, right? Wrong. It's really boring being stuck in the house all day. Don't get me wrong, I'm totally glad we're out of school, its just that today isn't a very good snow day, considering there's no snow. So, December 8th, 2005 is officially the worst snow day ever.

Tomorrow, swim meet in Duncanville against Cedar Hill. Friday night swim meets=noooo fun. Hopefully I'll be in this one though, because I've been out for like, 6 or 7 meets. It's definately time to get in again.

Yeah, this was a relatively boring entry, but then again, being stuck in the house for forever on a snow day is REALLY boring.

Better update later, loves!"

"event","even though everyone and ther moms are doing this, in the spirit of thanksgiving, i 'm making a list of people, places, things, etc. that i'm thankful for.

-for god- the only person who truly listens to me and understands me completely. and for his only son, who died for me to make sure i am free from sin.
-for my mom, a person i can trust with all my heart and soul.
-for my crazy father, even though i fight with him at least once a day.
-for my loving southern family on my mom's side.
-for my loving yankee family on my dad's side. let's just say we've had many arguments over ""why the south is better than the north."" they definately bring diversity to the family.
-for my best friends in the entire world: sara, nika, tori, crystal, kelly, carter, katelyn, audrey, nick, bryan, johnathan, cynthia, and all the other ones i didn't name. you guys have been there for me through so much, and i'm so thankful that i have such amazing and supportive friends to help me through everything. i love you all!(please don't be offended if i didn't name you)
-for music. and movies. 
-for that crazy garland high school. 
-for having a roof over my head, food on my table, warm clothes, and the best friends and family anyone could ever ask for.
-for everything i've been through, all the friends i've gained and lost, and all of the drama that's come around- without all of it - even though it sucked at the time - i woul;dn't be the strong person that i am. and i'm thankful for all the mistakes i've made for the same reason. without all of these mistakes and everything, i wouldn't be the same person i am today.

pretty sure there's probably more. but that's all i can think of for now. real update later, guys!"

"event","whoaaa today was a loooong day.

woke up at 6 this morning and headed to the TISCA non-qualifiers meet in McKinney. that sucker lasted forever...but then again, when do swim meets ever not last forever?

pretty good meet though.. pretty sure we got like 4th.. 5th... something like that.. which is pretty good, cause there were like 15 teams. so yay, go MOST!

playoff game started at 2, and of course, i was still at the meet.. and by the time we left it was already 20-7. and that blew, cause i really thought we were gonna lose. and so i was just like fine, i'll go home, but i'll stop at sonic first. so i stop, and i'm sitting there, and my phone rings, and when i pick it up, all i hear is sara screaming ""WE WON!"" so i'm like freaking out, and i rush to the square, and EVERYONE and their mom is there, which is amazing. the band played, cheerleaders cheered, bellguards did their thing, and it was great. best time i've ever had at the square.

went to sara's for a lil bit, then came back home, and now i'm here, watching forrest gump, and about to go to sleep, cause 6:00 is really early for a saturday morning.

i realized today that exactly one year ago today, i broke up with drew. exactly one year ago, at this very meet, i started dating carter. it's just crazy how things can change in just a year. and i'm not saying this to make it seem like i wish we still were or whatever, cause i don't want that at all. so don't take it like that. but it's just.. crazy how things can change in a year.

and i've realized that i'm sick of being treated like i'm nothing. sick of being treated like i don't matter. just sick of it all. i'm tired of letting people walk all over me, and i'm sick of people who treat me like that when i haven't done anything to them. as of right now, things are going to change.

and as of right now, i give up on something else. if you don't know what i'm talking about, then oh well. but if you do, as of now, i'm through. it's time to move on.

i just wanted to thank everyone who was there for me last night. that was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me, and i'm so glad i had so many people that cared enough about me to stay there and make sure i was okay. i saw so many people with looks of complete concern on their faces, and i saw people there that i've never seen look that worried...ever. it's so good to know that so many people care that much about me.

if you don't know what i'm talking about, last night at the swim meet i hyperventilated so bad that i couldn't move or breathe. my entire body was numb and tingling, and my hands and feet contorted and got stuck in wierd ways. i couldn't breathe, my heart was racing, and i couldn't open my eyes. i couldn't move at all, and i was so scared and i didn't know what was happening to me. i was breathing like, 40-something times a minute and you're only supposed to breathe 16 times a minute. my pulse was super high, and i almost went into shock. they called the paramedics, and they rushed in and tried to regulate my breathing/heart rate, and eventually took me to the ER. i was stuck in the ER for 3 and 1/2 hours, cause it took them a while to get me back to normal, and then they had to monitor me and make sure i didn't do it again. they did all these tests, like for blood sugar and what not, because they thought i was diabetic. they finally let me out, and when i got home, crystal and aaron were waiting for me. that made me feel so much better, it was unreal. and so many people called here, and called my mom, and just wanted to know if i was okay. so thanks to everyone, it's amazing to know you all care.

when i actually could open my eyes, i remember seeing crystal, and emily, and carter, and mrs. kelly, and a few other people who i can't remember looking at me with such concern it's unreal. i just... am really touched to know i actually have people in my life that care that much about me.

and my mom told me today that i actually made my dad cry. she said he called her freaking out and crying because he didn't know what to do. and that, out of everything, touched me the most, because we never get along, and the fact that he was that upset and worried really hits me hard.

and now, after it all, i'm exhausted and still a little shaky. i'm going back to school tomorrow though, so i'll see you all there.

school's going well. passed economics--i really don't know how. but i guess the point is that i'm amazing and i pulled that 74 out of my ass. lol. 80 in algebra. 80-something in spanish. 80-something in history ((i hope)). 90-something/100 in choir and swimming, duh. 63 in english--thank god for waivable classes. it's all because i didn't get my IWA accepted. but i'm writing my first one for the second six weeks like, tonight to turn it in on monday. i WILL get them both accepted this time. no way around it. 

it's so wierd that i failed a class. i've never failed anything...ever. it's just crazy. all because of those damned IWAs. eh, oh well. first six weeks is officially over, and it's time to step it up. no more slacking.

i have a feeling that swimming might just kill me. being in morning and afternoon is kinda throwing me off. i hate waking up at 5:45 one morning, and then like, 5:15 the next. i'm literally dead on A days. all i've gotta say is if i'm not in damned good shape at the end of all this, i'm gonna be mad. lol. but things are going okay. i'm getting better at running, and improving slowly but surely on fly. besides the lack of sleep/energy, everything's cool.

choir is amazing. i hate the after school rehearsals, but hey, who doesn't. but it's amazing to hear how good we are, and it's only been like a month. we're gonna kick ass at TMEA in february.

i have amazing friends.

"event","wow. last week was fun.

nothing really interesting til thursday, actually.

thursday--battle of the bands. most were good, a few weren't. *cough*creepygothband*cough*. but clang, always my enemy, and pigskin were all good. and holden's band was good too, but i don't remember their name. lol sorry. but always my enemy won, and they played sugar we're going down and the best of me---two absolutely amazing songs. so i was fine with that. afterwards, sara and i hung out for a while, and saw a bunch of people. went outside, waited for sara's mom, talked to andrew. and puckett. sara's mom came, and we left, the end.

friday--school was pretty boring. as usual. and then, after school, crystal came and picked me up, we got aaron, cynthia, and carter and headed out to ennis. what an absolutely awesome game. except for the stupid nazi cops that wouldn't let us stand on the fence. it's just what we do--i mean, who doesn't stand on the fence at football games? whatever. still had a good time anyways. won 24-20. left, got lost coming home. lol. went to the square. hung out for a while and talked to chrystal, and holden, and sara fitz, and puckett, and ryan, and lauren, and andrew. had a pretty good time. there were people sitting on crystal's car making out though, so that was kinda gross. but besides that, a good time. left, dropped cynthia off, and me and crystal came back here and hung out, and eventually fell asleep.

yesterday--nothing really during the day. around 3, sara came over, and we hung out and got ready, and went to lauren's party. it was really fun... it was kinda wierd at first because i didn't really know many people, but it got better and i ended up having a really good time. i miss all my middle school friends. alot. :-(. but nick brought me home, and i went to sleep.

today--homework. and homecoming shoes/jewelry/etc shopping. maybe. we'll see. 

but for now, homework like crazy.

i really wish i could say ""eh, it's just a football game."" but everyone knows thats a lie. lol. a garland football game is waaaay more than ""just a game"".

wow, its great how i got so into this game, and i didn't even go to it. lol. but i'm definately finding a way to get to ennis next week. for sure.

well, not much going on in the life of mandi except school. and swimming. and choir. as usual. no big surprise there.

random thing i found and thought was cool.

ten random things about me
1. sometimes, i completely lose track of what i was saying, like, 2 seconds before. i just kinda stop, and i'm like...wait, what was i saying?
2. i am deathly allergic to that chemical they put on lettuce in salad bars. like holy crap, if i eat like a tiny piece of anything with that on it, i get sooo sick, no joke. 
3. i love elvis presley.
4. i am the biggest hopeless romantic in the world.
5. i'm addicted to law and order SVU
6. i'm scared of singing in front of people, like by myself, but i love karaoke. wierd, huh?
7. i was in drill team/dance 1st-7th grade.
8. i love garland high school traditions with all my heart and soul.
9. my back bruises on its own all the time. i honestly have no idea how or why.             
10. when i was little, i had a golfish, and when it died, my mom would just go get a new one while i was at school. she did this every time, and i thought i had like, an invincible goldfish.

nine ways to win my heart
1. make me feel like i'm the apple of your eye and that nobody comes before me 
2. make me laugh
3. be smart.
4. be sensitive
5. make me feel like i can depend on you for anything, anytime, anywhere. i need to know you're there for me.
6. support me, my dreams, my ambitions, and my goals.

"event","oh wow. it'd been forever since i've updated this thing, as usual. no big surprise there.

well, lets just say, junior year has definately come at full force. being an IB junior is not a pleasant experience. and yes, i realize that i'm not full IB, and i pity those of you who are, but that dosn't mean that i don't have a heck of a lot of work to do and things to stress over, contrary to popular beilef. but yes. i really think it'll all work out for the best in the end. i'm still sooooo unbelieveably(i'm pretty sure i spelled that wrong) thankful that i went to garland. if i went anywhere else, i don't know what i'd do. honestly.

swimming is pretty hard when you didn't practice all summer. oops. but it'll get easier and easier as time goes along. and acappella is absolutely amazing. and that's all i can even say about that.

but i'm kinda frustrated about a few things. like, i'm the kind of person who wants to be really good at everything i do. and i know that's impossible for like, 99.9% of the population. but i don't like not being good at things. for example, butterfly. i'm so frustrated that i'm so bad at it. i really don't understand; i can drill it perfectly, and kick it almost perfectly... but it's like add in that second arm and it's like whoa no. you suck. and i know ""practice makes perfect..."" but i've been practicing for like forever and i'm a very impatient person.

i'm frustrated about my dad's doctors. they're all stupid. they don't do what they need to do, and when they finally decide what they should've done, it's too late, and it won't work any more. like, at first, my dad couldn't straighten his elbow because of the cast. now, he can straighten his elbow, but he can hardly move his shoulder. and his hip is still completely screwed over, and they've not done anything about that at all. they're all just effing stupid.

and boys frustrate me to no end.

i really hate it when people pick on me, my faults, and my shortcomings... just to make themselves seem better. it's totally rude. it's nice to be confident, but to be arrogant is a totally different story.

but yes. on another note, this year is gonna be sooo hard, but i have a feeling it's gonna totally be worthwhile. i really think it'll be an amazing year.

..and i already have my homecoming dress and my winter ball dress. now all i need is a date, and i'm totally set. ;-)

well, leave me comments...and i'll love you forever! :-)

much love

inititation was tuesday. one word-GROSS. 
mustard, ketchup, mayonaise, relish, hot dogs, buns, popcorn, peanuts, soda, cocolate syrup, ice cream, sprinkles, etc etc all over me.
umm eww.

swim team party was that night too. it was pretty fun.
bailey's wallet got stolen though, so thats not fun.
but other than that, had a splendid night.
had waaay too much fun.

spent the night with tori last night.
kelly came too.
uniform checkout was yesterday too. it's kinda fun having people oooh and aaah about how skinny you are. lol. that doesn't happen to me much, so when it does, it's great fun.

today i have to do the little bit of history i have left, the color-marking for english, and answering the questions on the bookmark for english too.

damn carter and his sudden houston-going.

well, we just found out my dad can't go back to work for at least 6 more months. this is getting ridiculous. i'm sick of living like this, my mom is sick of living like this, and i know my dad is sick of living like this. i hate texas. this state is like the worst at taking care of its injured workers. texas workman's comp should just go kill itself. its the worst feeling in the world when you can't pay your bills or buy groceries... i've had to live like that once, and i'm absolutely terrified of having to do it again. when they just randomly take away your medicine and your pay, its horrible. we can't live on just my mom's salary alone. i'm scared i'm gonna have to like quit everything to go get a job. i mean, i'd do it if i needed to, but swimming and choir are such huge parts of my life, and i don't know what i'd do if i had to quit. and i know it sounds selfish, but its true. and i feel bad because of all the stuff i'm involved in.. a cappella and swimming are like huge money guzzlers. and we don't have the money for it. and i feel horrible for having them spend so much money just for me to be involved in it. and yeah, everything just kinda sucks right now.

but i gotta go do school stuff..

comment, pleeeeeeeeeease.

much love

well, the beach with sara was fun. it was really actually a pretty bad trip, considering the beachhouse was falling apart, it rained, there was a shark attack on our beach, the red tide came, and our toilet broke halfway through the week. there were no boys, and i got sick. and umm... yeah. but we walked on the beach alot, and tanned, and we played in the rain on the beach. that was probably the highlight of the trip. but yeah, we made the best of it and had a pretty damn good time if i do say so myself.

got home from the beach, left 2 days later for illinois. so, now for the day-by-day account of my trip to illinois.

tuesday-left, drove to blytheville, arkansas- a very dull city- and stayed the night. 

wednesday-left blytheville, and drove in to decatur. just relaxed and watched t.v. and stuff for the day, cause we were all exhausted from the ride.

thursday-woke up, went to breakfast, and went around downtown decatur for the day.

friday-left for chicago. my god, how i LOVE that city. picked up my cousin matt and went to the shedd aquarium. it was really fun. i saw a dolphin show, and the whales, and sharks, and sea otters, and penguins, and yeah. it was great. then we went to my cousins michael, sue, sophie and milo's new house. it is gorgeous. and my new little cousin milo is adorable. and yeah. we just hung out and celebraated my uncle's birthday.

saturday-helped the cousins put up all their stuff in their new house. went to Ikea, and then out to dinner. came home, hung out, and at like 11, sue and i decided we wanted dairy queen. so we made a dairy queen run. came home and went to sleep.

sunday-sophie came in and woke me up at 6:30 to play. *grr*. went to breakfast, and then to oakbrook mall, and then headed back to decatur. got home, watched tv, went to bed.

monday-went to breakfast, then went shopping. got 4 new shirts, a pair of jeans, a pair of shoes, and my homecoming and winter ball dresses. great shopping trip. that was all that day...

tuesday-went swimming at the Y and did some laps. went home, took a nap, and went to mattoon to see the grandparents. went out to dinner, then back to their house, and kinda just talked about alot of things. it was a good visit.

wednesday-went to the new abraham lincoln presidential museum, and it was actually really cool. it had like all the stuff he was wearing when he was assassinated, and alot of other really cool things. spent the day there, had a really long history lesson, and came home.

thursday-umm. don't remember what i did during the day, but that night, went to sullivan to see fiddler on the roof. it was amazing. literally the best play i've ever seen.  

friday-went and swam some laps again, went to lunch, and my daddy came and got me. went back to the grandparents so he could see his daddy. then went and spent the night and randy and sandy's. saw austin (3 year old kid who calls me his girlfriend). he's adorable. hung out till about midnight, and went to sleep.

saturday- drove. all day. kill me.

and that's my trip. i missed you all terribly.

well, i still haven't been initiated. kinda getting nervous about that.

baileys entry made me sad. the one about losing her best friend. it made me realize alot of things. i realized that i've tried to be in the ""popular"" group my entire life, like many kids do, and i cared too much about what people think of me and how they percieve (sp?) me. i realized now that none of that matters. i don't want to be popular or anything. i just want to be me. i'm so glad that i've got amazing friends and i wouldn't trade any of them for anything in the world. i'm glad that i've realized that what everybody else thinks shouldn't and doesn't matter. my way of thinking is if you don't like me for me, tough. i don't want to be around you if you don't like me for who i am. and i really miss all my middle school friends. it makes me sad cause i'm never invited to anything, and nobody ever really talks to me anymore. i doubt most of them even read this. but if you do, just know that i miss you, and i want to get together again sometime soon.

well, that's enough for my mushy part of the entry.

and i also have alot on my mind about something. i'm really lost, and confused, and i don't know which way to turn. grr. everything is so difficult.

i'm gonna go.

much love.

i just have stuff going through my mind that i need to write in here.

i am... frustrated. i'm finally over carter, and i like 2 other guys... one that lives so far away that i don't think it would work, and the other is right here, but doesn't feel the same way about me. and then there's this guy who's absolutely amazing, and he likes me that way, but i don't like him back. what the heck is wrong with me? it's just like nothing can ever work out for me. i find this amazing guy, totally by chance, at a swim meet, and i really like him, but he lives sooo far away, and i honestly don't know if i'm a strong enough person to make this kind of relationship work. i mean, i talk to him every day, and he seriously is awesome. and then there's this other guy that i like, that just doesn't like me. and then, like i said, i have this other guy who actually likes me, who is awesome and has always been there for me, and i don't feel the same way about him. and it's just like ugh. how annoying.

well, on a brighter note... my birthday's in 3 days. yay! sweet sixteen baby!

well, i guess that's all for now.

"event","ah, such a fun weekend. lets see

friday, bailey and her parents came and got me around 5, and we hit the road. we plugged in blue collar comedy tour, and watched it on the way there. we stopped at dairy palace in canton, and oh man. it was GOOD. and we got like 7 fake tattoos. haha cause we're still like 5 years old. but yeah, we got stuck in traffic for like an hour... and it was lame. but we finally got there, and we went into our room, changed into our swimsuits, and headed straight for the hot tub. haha. it was like 5000 degrees though, so we got into the pool, which was really nice, and played on the lifesaving devices. haha. then we checked out the exercise room, and went back to our room and went to sleep.

saturday, woke up, ate breakfast, went to the meet. met nick, and kelsey. kelsey's really cool, and nick was okay. haha. and bailey did pretty good in the meet. and while i was sitting on the bleachers, watching her last event for the day (the 200 IM), these creepy guys came up and started talking to me. one was named eric, and he had his left nipple pierced.. and one was brandon, and he was so sunburned he looked like a lobster. haha. so they talked to me, and then me and bailey left, got back to the hotel, took a shower, and got all hot for the dance. so we go to the dance, and its like 7 year old paradise. so we're like ugh. lame. and we walked around for a while, and then, we went into the place where the dance was, and we saw this guy.he was really cute. and he kept looking at us. so what do we do? that's right. we grabbed him and started dancing with him. haha. so his name is brent, and we exchanged numbers, and yeah. we went back to the hotel, changed into swimsuits and met up with brent and meg at the holiday inn. met mr. antisocial (matt) and he was pretty cool, except for the whole antisocial thing. but yeah. the cops came and kicked us out of the hot tub, so we went and sat in this hallway and talked for awhile. then we left, went to mcdonalds, and slept.

sunday, woke up, ate, went to the meet. hung out with bailey and brent. brent left, and i was sad. but he said he's gonna call me, so yay! and we left, ate in canton, and came home. slept.

monday, started summer school. not too bad. carter's in my class, saw ernie and maggie. yay. went out to sali's with sara and then saw the sisterhood of the traveling pants. sooooooooo good. yay.

today, boooooooring. gave a speech, wrote one more, and writing another one on eleanor roosevelt. whooooooooop.

well, later guys. COMMENT!!!!!

wednesday, woke up at 7, took a shower and got ready, and went to summer school registation. it took waaaay too long if you ask me, but hey, i'm impatient. then my dad took me to my grandparents house, and we went to lunch with my aunt kristie, and then we went shopping for a little while. went back to grandparent's, took a nap, and then as soon as the across-the-street neighbor found out i was over there, she came over with pictures of her grandson... she's been trying to get us to date for like ages, and i haven't seen or talked to the kid since i was like 8. so yeah, i'm thinking no. so after that, i helped my memaw cook dinner, and we ate dinner, and we watched a movie, and i went to bed.

so umm, yesterday, i don't think i did like, anything until 4-ish. cause at 4-ish, bailey came and picked me up, and we went back to her house. and like as soon as we got there, she was like ""let's go get katelyn!!"" so we went and got misky and went back home. then we changed clothes, and did our hair and makeup, and went to chili's, and ate queso, and had the mean gay guy for a waiter again. so that was no fun. so then we decided it'd be fun to go bowling again, and on the way there, all these guys flagged us down and were like ""wanna go to the track?"" and of course, lovely bailey was all for it, and so we followed them for a little bit, and then we were like... wait. wtf are we doing? so we turned around and tried to lose them, but they turned around and follwed us for a while. it was scary. so we went to the bowling alley, and didn't bowl. we played the arcade games, and i must say i kicked some ass in air hockey. ;-). we then left, got gas, and went to my house to get my stuff to go stay at baileys house. and on the way, i saw dominick, alana, cody, chris, and ricky in a car. so i was like heyyy i know them! and then they turned around and we talked for like 2 minutes, and in that 2 minutes, cody decided he was in love with bailey and they should get married. haha. so yes, cody + bailey = engaged. so then we went to starbucks, and saw trina. and then we went back to baileys and just hung out and watched movies and talked online and stuff. and me and katelyn are ""married"" now... lol. it was fun.

woke up this morning, and bailey's dad was like ""go put gas in the jeep."" so we did. and then i had to come home. and yeah. that's pretty much been my day.

i might be going to SHREVEPORT with bailey this coming weekend. i hope i can..it'll be awesome.

and i'm okay now, i swear. i just hope things can go back to normal between us.

and um, yes. i think that's all.

birthday countdown:28 days. go buy me things. :-D.

COMMENT PLEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEE!!

..i'll love you F-O-R-E-V-E-R, i swear.

"event","wow... i haven't updated since april 28th. that's a hell of a long time. i guess i'll try to remember all the stuff that's happened to me since then..

well, i can't.. so the things that stick out the most are that fact that carter and i broke up, and that i made acappella. that's pretty much all the important stuff.. well, and the fact that we are now HALF WAY THROUGH with high school. that seems totally unreal to me. other than these things, the past couple of months have been a blur.

i'm going through like.. alot of wierd feelings right now about a specific dillemma. i don't know how to put it into words... i tried to sit down and tell sara how i felt about this specific problem.. and i like couldn't get it out. all i know is that i feel attached, and jealous, and betrayed, and... i honestly don't know what else. oh wait, yes i do... i think the word miserable sums it up. i'm just really effing confused and upset..and i really shouldn't be. i should not feel like this, or let this get to me.. but it does. and i don't understand why. i'm just really lost right now. and i think the only people who know what i'm rambling about are sara, bailey, nika, and nick.. but i'm pretty sure it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out.

gaaaaah. but anyway, i think i'm gonna start that history assignment today. and i have to mow the yard. and clean the bathroom. so i suppose i should go start on that...

sweet sixteen: 33 days. and don't you forget it either.

i have absolutely no idea where i left off.. so umm.. i'll start with... friday night!

i went to school, and i don't remember what happened there, probably not anything too important. well, we went to the park, and i tanned while everyone else played soccer. and then me, and sara, and her mommy went to taco bell, and then we went to my house, and me and sara hung out till i had to go to drivers ed, and then after drivers ed, i went to saras and spent the night, and we had chinese food and yeah.

saturday, i woke up and went to drivers ed, and then i did my first drive time, and i did really good. :-). and thennn i went home, and i mowed the yard for the first time in my life.. everyone be proud. and then i went back to saras...and her parents left, and we were about to go walk up to braums cause we really wanted some ice cream..and all of a sudden, we heard the music from an ice cream truck. soooo i go running down the stairs and out the front door, and chase this truck all the way down the street.. and might i say that truck was hauling ass.. and so we got ice cream and were very happy. so then we just chilled out and watched an SVU marathon, and yeah.

sunday... i don't think anything important happened.

i don't remember anything until yesterday...so here we go.

wednesday.. school was boring. so i came home, and got ready for banquet. went and picked up my memaw, and went to the place, and it was really nice. and we all just hung around and took pictures for like 8 years, and then we ate, and then it all started. and so we all got introduced, and then they started giving awards. i got... the academic acheivement award, the hustle award, and my senior award. so now i have 2 new trophies and a paper plate. hahaha. and i gottttt....... JUNIOR REP!!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAY!!! and then the seniors gave their speeches.. and man, it was sad. i got some awesome pictures though. i'm excited. then we dropped my memaw off, and we came home, and i went to bed.

today, nothing really happened, except that they want me to do beta club next year. me, carter, ana, and crystal were supposed to go see kung fu hustle.. but that fell through. so i'm sad. that would've been me and carter's like what, 4th date? lol. it makes me sad. but oh well, i'll live.

i gotta go.

leave me comments. i don't understand why you people leave everyone else comments, but not me. if you LOVE me, you'll leave me comments.

tuesday...taks day. blah. at practice we just gave our speeches for leadership positions next year **everyone wish me luck for jr. rep!!** and went home. went to drivers ed, and the burger king guy hit on me and gave me a free drink.. lol. it was cool cause i got a drink, but creepy all at the same time. annnd yeah. drove home again.

today.. review day. blah. english was boring. at practice we just listened to more speeces, and coach was like when i call your name, you need to stand up and you have 5 seconds to say why we should vote for you. so carter had just gotten done with his speech about how he is ""the perfect jr. rep"" and coach called my name, and i stood up and said ""i'm mandi. i'm running for jr. rep, and you should vote for me cause i'm better than carter."" and everyone was like ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo and it was hilarious. i was greatly amused. and now i'm here.

haven't updated in like 8 years, so yeah. i can't remember everything thats happened since forever ago, so whatever.

ummmm well, not too much has really happened... but i did raise my chemistry grade 20 points in under 2 weeks, cause i'm super awesome like that.

yesterday was me and carter's 5 month anniversary.. :-D. it seems longer to me.. but hey, its all good. so yes. very happy about that.

today, i woke up like really sick this morning... i wanted to die. but i got better, and its all okay now.

went to the park for swimming and played soccer. and by ""played"", i mean i watched while everyone else played. hahaha. it was fun. and then i went to taco bell with sara and her mommy, and she's spending the weekend with us, and its gonna be super awesome.

annnnnd randy and sandy are here, and randy an my dad left for the races today, so its just me, my mom, sandy, and sara, and tomorrow my aunt kristie and uncle dave are coming over to spend the night, and we're gonna have a hella awesome time.

and yeah. i've decided i need to change some things about myself. i need to take better care of myself, and not do things i've done before that could come back to haunt me in the end, and i need to sever ties with people who don't bring out the good things in me. i need to stop falling victim to temptations, and i need to just be a better person. so yeah, i just need to find out who i really am, and what i really want. so - no more drinking ( i didn't do that very much, and i never got wasted or anything, but i still need to stop.)no more cutting people down. no more slacking off in school. no more getting depressed over little things. no more eating till i'm about to explode. no more, no more, no more. i'm done with being a bad person.

okay, so thats all. i gotta go get ready for drivers ed.

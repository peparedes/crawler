"event","This is a final post to let people know where on the web they can find me.  This journal ran its course and became not much more than a mirror for my flickr account and I have far too many things I struggle to keep up with.  I will keep the account so that I can read my friends' journals and comment non-anonymously.  I can be found in these places:

<a href=""http://tuesdaymeetingdoodles.blogspot.com/"">Tuesday Meeting Doodles</a> - where I continue something I started here - posting my doodles from my weekly staff meeting at work.  I moved all the ones from here over to there and have started posting new ones and old ones that hadn't made it here yet.

<a href=""http://danmacholdphoto.com/"">Dan Machold Photo</a> - my very out of date photo website which I hope to turn into more of a blog format soon so I can update it more easily.

<a href=""http://www.showlistaustin.com/"">ShowlistAustin</a> - still going, still growing.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mybloodyself/"">Flickr</a> - where I post anything and everything photo-wise, whether it be good or experimental or my cat.

<a href=""https://twitter.com/mybloodyself"">Twitter</a> - where I post only about music - short record reviews and reports from and about shows I go to.

<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/machold?ref=profile"">Facebook</a> - yeah, you know what facebook is.

And after five years, I still play <a href=""http://www.kingdomofloathing.com"">Kingdom of Loathing</a> every day.

See?  I told you I have too much to keep up with!

-Dan"

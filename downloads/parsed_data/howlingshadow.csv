"event","Its been over a year since I have written in this.  Since I wrote in this connor got very sick with emcephalitis, I have not really lost weight.  Pat moved to Florida, my mothers condition has worsened. Work still sux.. When I first had connor, I did not feel an instant bond, but I was very happy with him, it took a little bit but it did happen, I think it was all the hormomes and stuff.  When connor got encephalitis I thought my life was over, They told me there was a good chance he might die  Sometimes I still look back at that and remember the feelings and just start crying.  He still has lesions on his brain but there is a little improvment. We have to go back in September for what I believe will be another sedation MRI.  Everyday I thank God that I have my little boy, I would have killed myself if soemthing had happened to him,  I really honestly believe that.  I had a mental break down and no one seemed to care about me, it was what they could do for themselves or get out of the situation.  Everyone except for Pat broke my heart, including my mother.  I write this in order to hopefully relieve some of the pains.  The panic attacks I get now are horrible, anytime my son runs a fever I freak out.  I have to take him to the ER about once every week or every other week.  Now that Pat, my best friend is gone I have to go alone and it gets very tiring...  His father still has not shown up, or tried to contact him... IF he ever did I would slap his face for sure.  Its hard being a single mom, but sometimes I feel I would not have it any other way.. I get all the kisses, I got to see my son come back to life.. I get all the hugs and I am becoming quite accustomed to that.  I have no vacation up here at the office, I have not had a real vacation in 3 yrs, the first year, my father died, second year, I had connor and this year, I had to use my vacation for his illness.  The ER doctors treat us like crap when we go in, but I still smile cause I know in my heart I am doing right by my son.  He is spoiled rotten because he gets everything he wants. LOL.. Sometimes, I just cry because I feel so completely alone...Sometimes I feel I just need a break, even if it were for just one night.  My co worker Crissy is a back stabbing gossiping queen bitch.  needless to say I am really not getting along with her.  I have been ""thrown"" out of the club, LOL."

"event","Well, tonight I am very depressed.  I am so fat and I am not used to being fat, I am used to being skinny and cute.  I tried so hard to lose the weight before the baby and now my mother says It will be even harder.  P said that too.  I am ashamed to show up at work, being so fat and ugly.  I feel completely out of control and I know this is gross, but, I had to have a level four epesiotomy (sp) and it hurts and no one seems to understand.  p tries to understand, bless his soul.  I cant crap and stuff and its making me miserable.  All I want is to have fun with connor and I cant, because I dont feel well at all.  I just feel strange, I think I am fighting post partum depression.  Not sure though.  I will just start crying and crying because I want to be the best mother I can but feel incompetant at the moment.  I tried calling my mother so I could spend some time over there tonight, but she did not answer the phone.  That kinda hurts cause she knows I need her.  I am worried she is mad at me or something.  She stays that way though.   Right now I just feel really fat and ugly, I need to work on that.  Work on my self esteem a little.  Start working out.  I am going to start a slow work out and diet tommorrow.  I will keep the progress in this journal.  I will be writing again tomorrow, I think this is very theraputic.  Watching American Idol tonight.  Tonight is connor an my first night completely alone.  Wish us luck.  I know we will be ok, because we are loved."

"event","Well, today is the day and I am filled with many different emotions.  I have never been in a hospital before so I dont know what to expect.  I am home now, I stayed the night with P.  I have a lot going through my head, like having a baby for instance, weight loss, work.  I will probably be in the hospital alone for a while and it makes me even more nervous.  I am sure once I get there I will be ok, I hope.  I think during this whole pregnancy I have gained 20 regular pounds.  So I will be trying to lose the weight soon, hopefully before my aunts wedding.  I am annorexic so its hard for me, to keep  a balance.  It was very hard for me to quit being annorexic for the baby.  I will try to post a  pic of how skinny I was.  It was pathetic, but I do not see it at the time.  Right now, though my butt makes J lo look skinny.  Well I finally decided on the last name, since the father kinda left, its going to be my last name and if he wants it changed later he can pay for it.  I guess I pissed P off yesterday, but I really didnt mean to, he said I was talking rude to him.  It could have been my frustration showing through and stress.  so it really hurt me bad when he started yelling at me, I guess because in my head I was not yelling at him.  I must have cried for an hour or so, just cried and cried.  I try my hardest to help everyone out, make sure they have what they need, car, food, whatever, and I am just stressed beyond belief.  Work was really hard on me for taking time off, I only get two weeks paid vacation and it frustrated me even more that I couldnt be induced yesterday because I have limited time to recover.  I am happy about one thing though, its supposed to snow Thursday and Friday.  Not to mention I am still recovering from the flu.  So I am still not 100%.  Well I am going to take a shower and rest some more, check the batteries that I am going to need for the swing.  I guess I will not write in this  until after Connor and I get home."

"event","So much for my planned out Saturday!  Left my car and Mum and Dad's, so it'd be there for me to get straight home after tea, before going on to get my car tax and post my parcels and some stuff from the supermarket.  Got that done pretty quick, and was just about to have my dinner before going onto the match when my Mum rung and told me she'd heard the kick-off was at 5.15.  Checked on the net, which confirmed this, so I had to go and pick up my car then came back home, finally got my dinner, and did some DVD watching and copying before going to the match.  Saw John at the match, which was really nice.  It used to be great when he, Carol and I used to have seats together.  He gave me a hug and kiss before we went our seperate ways.  The match was fantastic - our first win in the Premiership and won by a fantastic goal by Jags!  Had a celebratory McDonalds.  Thought the crowds might have dispersed by the time I got the bus, but I was wrong.  Vegged in front of the telly when I got home.

Suzie and Tony were at Mum and Dad's for Sunday lunch.  It was nice to see them for the first time since Uncle Alan's funeral.  Was there 'til quite latish in the afternoon, then just caught up on stuff I had to do at home.

A parcel from Liz arrived yesterday.  Stupid bloody postman trying to cram it through the door!  We had a right job trying to get it out.  Don't know when I'll get round to putting those Steph Shows on DVD.  She sent me some chocolate too - those Cadbury wildlife bars we have, but we Aussie animals on the wrapper, and another brand I haven't had before.  Oh, hang the diet!

Neighbours = Crap at the moment - even Kusan.  This stupid pet therapy storyline, plus the other storylines they've got coming up for Karl.  Bet Fletch will be glad not to renew his contract."

"event","Not very nice stuck at work on your birthday when it's been such a beautiful day, but here I am.  Got some lovely cards and pressies from friends and family, plus money.  Think I will buy one of those chrome kettles I've been after from Sainsburys.

Ooh, My Fame DVD arrived today - will have to watch some when I get home tonight.  Hope they are released all on DVD eventually, but at least I've got the majority on tape.

Found out today that you can put down to work 0900 x 1700 during the Christmas pressure weeks.  Am seriously thinking of it - as I can make up the lost money by working at the weekend.  It'll be like having a normal life for once!  Knowing my luck, though, I'll not get it, as they'll give priority to those with kids."

"event","Was feeling really nervous about the match on Saturday.  Didn't get down there as early as I planned to see he Liverpool players arrived.  Just had time to call at the chippy before going on to the ground.  I couldn't beleive how well we played in the first half.  I love where I'm sitting now, so close to the pitch.  You feel so involved in the action!  Mind you, it was horrible when Riise(sp?)got injured right in front of us.  We more than deserved to take the lead.  The way Liverpool came back at us, it looked likely they'd score, but the penalty was very dodgy.  Well, at least we've got some points on the board.  It'd be fantastic if we won against Spurs tonight.  Can't wait to get a programme from Paul.

It was nice to see Suzie and Tony for the first time in ages on Sunday.  Tony's going to try and fix my mp3 player when he gets the chance.  I didn't mention I'd bought a new video ipod.  So cool, but I shall have to get some software to convert my vid files to play on it.  Don't know as yet if they are coming on Sunday so Suzie can watch the Wednesday match.  I hope so.

The Neighbours tape from Marie arrived today.  So funny that she lives so near to me.  She'd have been better just putting it through my letterbox.  Watching atm - some Open Air stuff with Anne, Craig, Elaine and Stef - top stuff!"

"event","It started off a bit of a frustrating weekend.  I was sweating over whether the postman would come before I had to go out - in case my goodie bag had come.  He did come, but the goodie bag didn't, or that DVD I ordered for Liz.  This means I've been tied in all morning, and no post has come today so far...

When I went to town, I couldn't see the CDs I was wanting, then when I got home the DVD I'd set burning hadn't worked.  I panicked and wasted the money ordering some new software, but that didn't work either.  By the time I'd done messing, I was in rush to get ready to go over for my Mum and Dad's for tea, and then on to meet Karen.  We saw the animated film Cars, which was funny.  I couldn't guess who was doing the voices, though.  I shall have to try and arrange to meet up one lunchtime with Karen to see her Bakewell/Chatsworth House snaps.

I was messing about with my computer again, first thing yesterday, and thought it wasn't working properly.  After rebooting it a few times it did, thank God! I converted those avi files to wmv, and they burned off okay using my original software.  Wish I'd not been so hasty and saved my money now.  At least I managed to see those CDs I was after online, and probably cheaper than if I'd seen them in Virgin or HMV.  I managed to record to DVD the two series of SMASH!, which I was pleased about.  Only about another million video tapes to convert to DVD - lol!  Don't know if Chris will want a copy, or not.  So, all in all, a fairly productive weekend."

"event","Hey, I was on the radio yesterday - how surreal!

I'd tried to get through to the quiz on Real Radio last week, when I heard the question about Royal Mail.  The woman who answered the phone said she'd ring me back, but someone got the question, so I switched my mobile off as I didn't know any of the others.

Yesterday I decided to get through and answer the Eurovision question.  I had a feeling it was Jessica Garlick's Come Back that was the last song to be given 12 points by a jury, but it took me a while to confirm this on the net.  When I got through, and the woman said she'd ring me back, I wasn't too hopeful.  At least I was working with Susan, so I could explain to her why I might have to suddenly dash off somewhere quiet.

When I was rung back, I though I would be the next caller on, so went outside.  They went to another caller first, so I had to go back in case I'd been missed.  When I did get on air, I could hardly hear what Lee - the presenter - was saying.  With it being Yorkshire day, they asked, as an aside, what my favourite thing was about Yorkshire.  I said Yorkshire puddings (should have said the Blades!) and we talked about that for a bit.  When he finally asked me the question, I was glad it was right, and that the person setting the question hadn't got it wrong, as I think has happened before.  I was asked to leave as question, as expected, so I asked who plays Dr Karl Kennedy in Neighbours. - lol! I expected that after I went on air, they'd take my details to send me the goodie bag, but they cut me off.  I sent a text in, but I must have heard the number wrong because it wasn't sent.  I managed to email Lee though.  I'll give it 'til the weekend, then get in touch if it doesn't show up.  After humiliating myself on the radio, I bloody want my prize!"

"event","Finally got my season ticket this morning! I couldn't believe it when I found they'd called when I was at work on Tuesday, then Dad couldn't get it from the ticket office. I thought she wasn't going to turn up when it got past 11 o'clock.  So glad I didn't have to try and get through on the phone to complain.  Just checked the fixtures, and there's home matches on the day I go away, and the day I get back. Maybe they might get changed for TV. At least it's only Blackburn or Reading. I doubt I'll get back for the Reading match with having to change trains a few times, unless we could set off earlier."

Went to the cinema with Karen on Sunday to see Superman Returns.  Not bad - certainly better than POTC 2.  Brandon Routh looks so like Christopher Reeve.  I did think the idea of Superman having a kid was a bit weird.  I'm glad I didn't read any reviews beforehand, so wasn't spoiled on this.  Better than the film was the air condition in the cinema - bliss!  Karen told me she's having work problems, and is currently off.  Hope she gets them sorted.

Got a parcel from Liz last week.  It only took 4 days.  I don't know why I thought that Paul and Gail were on the cover of the TVW for the wedding/CamRob.  Oh well, some excellent cuttings as usual, though no extras this time.  I posted my parcel to her on Saturday, and couldn't beleive it when she emailed me to tell me she'd got it today.  And people have the cheek to complain about the post!

God, how much am I loving the discs that Chris has been sending me!  Tiswas, Swapshop, Runaround - 70s ads and YTV continuity.  Just wish I had the time to watch them straight away.

Well, in ""N"" Karl can't get Izzy's passionate embrace out his mind - which not better be in the way that sounds - there'll be trouble if it does!  Also, he spends the following night at Susan's as her official boyfriend.  Sweet, but it's bound to be really awkward and inhibiting.  I've got visions of Rachel and Zeke listening at their bedroom door!"

Had a good weekend last weekend.  Went with Karen to see Pirates Of The Caribbean 2.  There were some funny individual moments, mainly from the excellent Johnny Depp, but half the time I didn't have a clue what was going on!  Also, I went out for Sunday dinner with my Mum and Dad.

Work was better, compared to last week.  We finished early every night.  I was pissed off that yet another road on my way to work was shut off, making my journey even longer, but now they've finally finished the road works on the Parkway - only about a month later than scheduled!

Went round to Mum and Dad's for lunch on Thursday, instead of the usual Friday.  It was certainly a full house, with Dad and Suzie being there too.  I didn't know that Suzie had got the same week in September off as me.  I'm sure we'll get to do something together that week, even if Tony does get it off as well, and they're doing stuff in the house.

Am just loving the TOTP stuff I'm getting from Chris.  He's also going to send me some Tiswas and Swap Shop stuff.  To add to this nostalgia-fest, I got an edition of Wacady off UKNova.  Absolutely hilarious!

Finishing with ""N"".  Can't believe that latest spoilers that Karl is going to (accidentally) get Izzy pregnant.  FFS, can't they let them be happy for once!  I'm starting to wish they'd left them apart, rather than this.  Still clinging to the hope that it's not going to be his sprog, even though I doubt it'll split them up.  Not heard from Liz yet, but I bet I'm right in thinking this definitely make her stop watching.  The upside of this is that A&J are filming in London.  I'm going to try my best to get the week off, though it would help if I knew when it was going to be!  I've got to get a week booked soon, no matter what."

"event","I'm absolutely fuming with Debbie, and with Christine too for that matter.

Debbie was in one of her usual moods at WTL.  Christ, you'd think there was only her who ever did any work!  As if that wasn't getting my back up enough, then Christine had to make a point of thanking people who'd stayed behind on Monday night, having a dig at those of us who had every right to walk out at 10.00.  When I asked Christine what happened if someone had an accident after 10.00, Debbie just went off on one.  She asked me what would happen if I'd tripped in the car park, running to my car, as if that had got anything to do with it.  Then she was going on about how disgusting it was, people walking out.  Talk about bloody rude.  I made it clear it was Christine I was asking a question to, not her.  It would've been nice if Christine had have backed me up on this.  I couldn't believe it when she was trying to make out that what Debbie was saying wasn't an attack just on me.  I said ""It doesn't sound like it!""  Anyway, Christine was trying to make out as though it wouldn't be a problem, in regards to a claim, if someone did have an accident.  There didn't seem much point me saying anything after that, so I just thanked her politely for answering my question.  It's a load of crap, anyway.  People have a hard enough time getting accidents put in the book as it is.  There's no point asking the Union, as I know what they'd say.  That aside, if we start staying behind, they'll start pushing us more and more.  It'll be a few minutes one night, then 20 minutes the next.  It's alright for Debbie to go off like she does, because she can't go 'til Terry does, anyway.  It soooo pisses me off the way she swans around like Queen Bee because she's married to one of the managers.  Well, maybe today will show that I'm not going to let her boss me around."

"event","Can't believe how pear-shaped it went at work tonight.  I know Monday's are usually bad, but they haven't been too bad these past couple of weeks.  We seemed okay on packets.  As all the business stuff was done, I thought I'd get a head start on the missorts.  I thought things had wound down for the bags coming off about 9.50.  When Mark asked me to sort on Road 6, there wasn't too much there.  Then I heard him radio the flats area, and realized there was still some more to come.  Then Kate said there was still a load of letters round on OPS.  When we got the bags off at 9.55, it was obvious they'd not get them all tied up in 5 minutes.  Saw Kate sneaking round the other side out of Mark's way, so followed her.  It was 10 by then, so most people were walking out, along with me."

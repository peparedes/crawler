Billy put in his two weeks notice about a week ago, for about an hour, before taking it back out of the turn in box. A couple managers knew he'd put it in but none of them are responsible for scheduling or for taking him off the schedule and arranging his leaving the company. However one of them took it upon herself to tell the head manager that even though that paper was no longer in the box that Billy had turned in two weeks notice. Result, Billy has no hours next week and may not have a job.

I'm really close to feeling like I should just file bankrupcy, which is hilarious since I have a job that pays me about 1,400 a month. I'm going to start canceling things I guess, get rid of all the extra shit. I need to go and drop my car insurance down about a million dollars...I have the best fucking coverage ever but I'm going to have to make it a hell of a lot cheaper now.

I keep babbling about money, it isn't really all that's been on my mind.

I called the therapist, waiting to hear back from her, although now I don't have a clue how I can afford it at all. I just feel like everything is going to hell. I talked to Billy about figuring out what we need for ourselves in life, and then seeing if those things can really go together for us to build a life. I already know they can't, I just don't know how to tell him yet. I know I'll be fine, but I worry about him. I want to leave this fucking state, I just want to go away and go to school. Funny thing is you're doing everything with your life I always wished I could do with mine, and the onyl reason I never did it was myself. Just when things started seeming clearer now new problems have come up.

My family always jokes about being cursed....then they always joke about me have the worst of it. Maybe it isn't such a joke after all.

I'm just down today, tomorrow will seem better. It has to, I can't see things being much worse.

Not being able to pay the bills, not knowing if Billy has a job or not, having a debt collector after me for my old apartment, a law suit that's been going on for over a year for thousands of dollars that I don't fucking have to pay my medical bills, not being able to afford health insurance, my car has something horribly wrong with the allignment.....the only other thing that could possibly happen would be for my car to explode, my apartment complex to burn down and my cat dying.

At least I have my cat.

He loves me even when I can't. Yet I don't know what I will do with him if I go to school like I want to next year. I still haven't figured out how to get the hell away from Billy by then. I'm going to go call Jill."

"event","In my journal entry Monday August 29th, 2005 (12:40 AM) I first posted this quote by Vincent van Gogh.

""Love is something eternal, the aspect may change, but not the essence.""

In that same entry I wrote, ""I love you differently now, or maybe I just grew up enough to put my love for you into perspective with my life and yours, but I still love you just as much, and I always will.""

I put both of these things there in reference to a particular person.

This is something that's been on my mind for days now...long before I let it come out. It is the reason I came back to your party. It is the reason I came back to talk to you at the bar only nights before then. It's the reason I came back to the Orange Blossom all those times, the reason I met you for lunch, the reason I've always followed you around and put anything around me on hold to make space for you, to have you be a part of my life.

I wouldn't say I am in love with you, although I know I've said it before. I'd like to retract that statement, as unlike me as that seems. I was never ""in"" love with you, and still am not. However, I do love you very much. Enough that I can't talk to you or even write to you without rambling on about stupid subjects that don't even make a difference to my life or anyone's life. Enough that I can't ever seem to actually say what I called you to say, or what I sat down to write. I spent a lot of time NOT being around you, and it was as much about me not putting forth an effort as it was you.

You shake me up, you turn my life upside down, you make me think....really think. And no matter how far away I get from you, even now that you're half way across the country, I can't get you out of my head.

I'm not going to say I'm in love with you, I'm not going to say I want to have a relationship with you...because both of those things are unreal and unattainable anyhow.

This is so much not like me at all. But I don't often feel like I know myself to much anymore except for when I act like someone I don't know at all. 

I simply desire you. Physically and mentally. I don't need your emotions, we have our own way with those...and I don't want you to be in love with me, I like what we have and what it can become over time. I am driven insane by the way you set me off though, my head reals after seeing you for days. I haven't thought as much about my life in months as I have in the last week since we had lunch, or the last two days for that matter.

I haven't had a desire to do anything with my life, but intellectually you put me there. You always have. You know you have. I can do it on my own, but there's just something about you that feeds my mind.

I'm sure there is more to come over the next few days, or weeks...or months...who fucking knows with me. This is just where my mind is slowing down for now. This was to much thought in to small of a space. To limited of words, and as always...to far away from you.

I wish I could have talked when you were right in front of me. I just freeze up for some reason, when I realized you were going, when I realize that you're gone....everything just froze for me."

"event","Been drinking a little, and doing some other things I should dabble in, like coke. Starting to hit the point of the night where I sink. I notice so much more when we're doing drugs all the ways that Billy hurts me and annoys me. I love him but jesus fucking christ. One person can only be so fucking needy and attention oriented, I don't know how I or anyone else ever delt with ME when I was still in that place in my life. I can blatantly tell him something bothers me, five times even, and he still will do it and then apologize after for ""accidently"" hurting me or my feelings.

I don't know what to make of our relationship some days. Sometimes he's so there and so sweet and so loving, and other days he's just off somewhere in his head in this world, without me, ignoring me to an extent even. I don't mind if he needs his own space but he doesn't ask for space, he just sits in front of you like a bump on a log who can't control himself when you ask what's wrong. Sometimes he blows up, sometimes he acts like nothing is wrong. I can't read him, I can't connect to him. When I do he changes.

I feel so lost right now, probably the fact that I can't think straight when I'm on this shit. I shouldn't do it. I shouldn't drink like this either. I should join AA or something. I've been drinking non-stop practically for a few weeks, I only don't drink when I'm at work.

I want to be alone so much. Not just to be depressed, although I definitly want to let some emotions out. I just want to be alone. 

Alone.

I can't think here, I can't be me here....I can't let go and be me. I'm so trapped in this life where I come home and he's here, I go there and he's there. I go to work and I'm Lindsay. I come home and I'm either overflowed with attention or ignored...it depends on the day. Even when he pays attention to me it doesn't feel about me. He over looks the things I ask of him, he ignores the things I say I need.

Tonight when I was really fucked up earlier he kept talking to me in Spanish. I told him about 5 or 6 times to stop it, that it messes with me when I'm fucked up because I don't understand Spanish. He still kept doing it. Then he ignored me, I had to have the 4th and only sober person here back me up for him to even believe me. I call his name for minutes and he ignores me to talk to his friends or whatever. He will stop in the middle of sentences to me and talk to other people. Or stop listening to me in the middle of sentences to talk to other people.

Why is it like this? If he loves me so much why is he like this?

I point out to him the problems, I tell him I'm not sure what to do. He just sits at my feet and cries, tells me he'll be better...he promises. He always promises. Promises for two years now, a year off and on and a year straight through...and still promises, none of which have ever been kept. Promises about loving me, saying he needs to treat me better....promises that are never followed through.

Promises about drugs, about work, about sex, about love, about talking...about caring.

Empty promises.

Why can't I leave him...why do I feel so trapped?

So many questions right now, and no time to answer them, to think them through...and no ability to even if I could.

I hate drugs."

"event","""i like real Seth.  i like the Seth that strips away the ramble and deals with reality.  i like seeing people in reality and how they deal with it rather than see someone create a false reality for others and hold a mirror up to reflect any analysis or intropection.""

I like real Seth too. I'm beginning to realize that maybe I haven't been him in awhile. I've always surounded myself with other people, always built my life along side someone else's. Now I've reached the ultimate high and low of that situation, I'm getting married. Why am I getting married? I don't know. It's not about loving Billy, because I do love Billy and I would marry him...but am I ready to now? For awhile now I've been waiting for him to get to this point too. But he's to scared, he's to afraid of what it means to let go. Can I really wait for him to be ready to part ways too? I hold on to Billy because I'm afraid to be alone, not because I don't think he'd still be part of me life, but because I'm scared to be alone, by myself being myself thinking about myself...some days I still hate who I am. Other days I hate who I used to be. And still sometimes everything seems like it's turning out good when things go wrong and bad.

It was this fear that seperated me from being able to live a life where I am simply myself and feel that it is good enough to just be me. 

I could build myself back up with Billy, I know that....but he isn't ready to build himself up too and because of that I stay down with him. I know we could pick up and find a happier life, even a life together somewhere that would be wonderful for us. If we could both deal with our issues. As long as we are together though we are the exact thing that will make both of us happy and both of us miserable. Happy to be together. Miserable because it gives us an excuse, a reason...not to be Billy or Seth, but all the more reason to be Billy and Seth.

Who I am doesn't depend on him, and who he is doesn't depend on me. So when will we both be able to see far enough ahead to correct this mistake. I could point it out, but I'm scared that he won't be able to deal with it. Or maybe I just know he won't want to. His sadness in the times that we've fought and almost seperated....his depression makes me scared for him. I don't want to live my life knowing I'd be happier if I was on my own but then feel bad for what it's done to his life and to him....but I know that it isn't my fault.

I know I have a complex about blaming myself, about other's blaming me and judging me. It's all I've had most of my life. I never was a very judgmental person and I never understood why everyone else had to be one. If I broke up with Beca and she was sad, so what, why is it my fault? Why can't my friends be my friends because she's hurt....even though we BOTH agreed to go our seperate ways? Why is it when Kat tried to kill herself everyone blamed me, how is it my fault? She is the one who fucked around on her girlfriend, made lame promises to someone else, fell short of her promises and then just wanted to bury the problem and pretend it didn't happen. I'm sorry I won't be burried and forgotten. And Higgins, Drahota, and Schmidt, what a fucking mess that turned out to be. Met all of them seperatly and had to deal with all of them being in the center of a collective of people who for some reason can't make their own opinions if the other's are with in fifty feet of them. Why can't you be my friend because she's there or he's over there?

I look back on all of my relationships in life and I'm so frustrated with them. The way I let people make me feel, the way I let them walk on me to hold themselves up, to keep their own heads over water while forcing me down. Blaming me for your short comings, trying to make even ME feel like they are my fault. And yes, I played my fair share in all these things and more, but you played your part too. You made your bed and yes I folded down the sheets, but I take responsiblity for being there....why can't you?

Why do I often feel like the only person in my life who actually cares about anyone else?"

"event","A lot has been going on here recently. At the same time...nothing has been going on here.

I've seen one of my friends more times in the last week than I have in some years since we met....and we've known each other for many years. It feels this way more often now than before.

Everything I love about this town....everything I miss that is somewhere other than here. I'm torn, I always have been. Between staying here or moving there, feeling complete and feeling trapped, everything in my life seems to go back and forth. Some days I don't know how to live without Billy, some days I don't know how to live without me...other days I just don't know how to live at all.

I'm not saying that I'm suicidal or anything like that, I'm very much the oposite. I'm worried about the way I live my life, I'm worried about what I could lose if I change the way I live....I'm worried that I'm only 20 and I worry about losing things, even though I completely realize that in time they'd either work out or something else would fall into place. Time doesn't heal all wounds...however I do believe that life will always find a way, a way to happiness. No matter what road you travel.

I'm a carefree person who is insanly up tight. I seem like an extroverted person but I'm actually extremely introverted. All the things I know about myself, that I know to be true seem some how diminished some how overlooked by others. That's what I love most about Billy. He gets me. Some days I don't know where I would be without someone like him, someone who really cares and understands. Other days I wonder what I'm doing with anyone at all when I'm such a mess on the inside. Giving him lectures about opening up and dealing with his problems when I can't deal with my own...can't even admit my own.

I feel like I'm falling apart a little bit. I've known you forever it seems...and although I've almost never come to you for help I've always known you were there. And although I know you are still there, will still be there...being there half way across the country just seems so far away right now. Now that you're leaving I realize I never got as close as I should have. You told me you didn't want me to shut myself away from you and although I didn't hide, I didn't come around either. I see you now, and I see what other's do, how you're different...the ways they think you are different. All I see though is you. The you I always have known. Maybe I always did know. You aren't changing who you are, you're finally becoming you. Maybe others didn't realize it, or maybe you just didn't let them see it.

I feel like I'm rambling. Because I am. Words, I don't have enough, but I don't need them with you. All of this, it was left here for you. And for me. Sometimes it only comes out if you direct it. And sometimes I wish I was good at talking to you, face to face, like I am at writting to you. But as good as I am at talking latly I seem to come short with words when I'm around you. At least short of the ones that matter the most.

""Love is something eternal, the aspect may change, but not the essence."" - Vincent van Gogh

I love you differently now, or maybe I just grew up enough to put my love for you into perspective with my life and yours, but I still love you just as much, and I always will. In ways you're my best friend, in ways you're my hero, I respect you more than any other person and I know that is part of what will always mean the most to you. No matter how few words or encounters happen between us in our lives, I will always feel that you know me in a way no one else does.

By and by though, the final thing I can think of is simply that I'm proud of you. I'm so fucking proud of you. If I love you differently it's only so I can love you more. I can see that you're ten times the person you seemed to be before. Happier, stronger, more caring and so much more of yourself. I don't know how much you thought I saw in you, but you're finally becoming the man I always knew you would be. Always. You're growing into the you that I fell in love with long ago. Maybe someday you'll really understand that, maybe you already do.

I need to sleep now, I'm emotionally drained, overworked (weekends are my worst time for work), stressed out, and I didn't get much sleep anyhow the last few nights. Life would be so simple, if I wasn't so hard on myself."

Today looking in the mirror I realize that with my shirt being completely unbuttoned, folded over a bit in the middle you can't tell at all that I have breasts. In fact I look like my shirt is hiding an awesome chest.

In a year I'm going to take out a loan and get chest surgery. Brownstien will do it. Once I know for sure about my loan I'll set up a date with him...that could take a long time.

"event","It's been awhile since I updated my journal but things have been busy around here. My boss was out of town for a week, leaving me in charge of the store, she finally got back yesterday...I couldn't have been more relieved. 

I forgot how dramatic stupid high school kids can be. Plus one of our new employees is a theif, we have it narrowed down to two people, now it's just time to seperate their shifts (they've both been on shift each time money went up missing) and wait to see what happens. We also had another employee steal money while Jean was gone but she got out of it because we didn't have enough proof, we all know it was her, but we have to give her the benefit of the doubt if we don't have proof. 

She also waited till after she got busted to start telling our bosses things about me, saying I sexually harrassed her at work and that I let Billy come into the store when we are closed and go where ever she wants to go. She brought up the Billy thing because Jean told her that her boyfriend couldn't come see her at work anymore, she's to dramatic about him, brings her social and love life to work to often. While Billy really was behind the counter, I never did sexually harrass her, to her surprise when Jean came back into town to find out about this stuff she has already heard from me, weeks before she left, that the girl was in fact hitting on me and asking me innappropriate questions about lesbianism and telling me how she wanted to have sex with a girl. Thankfully I reported that to my boss or my ass would have been on the line with her false acusations.

Monday was my mom's 50th birthday, we went out to lunch and I brought her over to show her our new couch at the apartment. I need to go over there and smoke her out for her birthday, she's love that. My mom the stoner. Her father and step-mother were in town for a few days, they left on Sunday. My grandfather had lots of things to talk to me about, he'd never met one of my girlfriends before and he had lots of little talks with me about how he didn't care I was gay and he told me stories about things that happened to him in his life relating to gay issues. For example when he was young a guy hit on him and his friend, his friend and him beat the guy up and threw away his wallet. Now my grandpa says he thinks about that every day and regrets it, he said he can't hate people for being gay because he has me in his life and he loves me.

Things are going really well for Billy and me, with the exception that he lost his antidepresants today, he can't remember where he put the bag he had them in. Other than that things are awesome. He stopped talking to his family again, reducing the stress in his life dramatically, his doctor agreed to take him on as a free patient since his parents had been paying for his antidepressants and what not.

I'm starting to look into things like T. I don't know how much I want to transition, but I know I want to do it to a certain extent. I'm also looking into moving out of Omaha, not soon, but in the next year or two if I'm lucky. I want to find somewhere that is more trans friendly than this town. Plus I need somewhere with more opportunities for someone like me, more of a community, more jobs, more therapists and doctors. More of everything. I love Omaha but there are things I need this town doesn't seem to be able to supply me. I guess we'll see where it all goes in time."

Not doing much but working and spending time with Billy. I work 6 days a week now but it's fun. I like my job a lot more, I like how it's more structured for me now. I have things to do at specific times and shit like that, it helps me feel a lot better. I'm being such a stereotypical bipolar person today.

I keep noticing stereotypes today too.

For the most part things are good, I am having gender problems recently, I've begun searching for a therapist.

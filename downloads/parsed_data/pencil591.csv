"event","Hey! man, this thing hasn't seen an update in about a year.  i don't really have much to write at this moment.  i visited my sister in center city today and we did some christmas shopping.  we also went to this place near her apartment to get this poster matted and framed for my brother.  the cool thing about this place is that you do all the work yourself. obviously they have people there showing you what to do, but you actually get to do it.  so my sister and i matted and framed this poster for him. it was pretty cool.  although, alyssa did get a little testy when we got to the one step and she couldn't get the thing lined up right to cut it...then she yelled at me for trying to help. ok, so she didn't really yell, but she did get testy. then she was all anal about there being the most miniscule piece of dust being on the glass or on the poster.  it was kind of funny actually..so i was of course making fun of her.  after that we got something to eat and then went shopping in center city.  it was fun, quite cold, but fun.
    
i have to finish my xmas shopping tomorrow. blah. i think i also have to take my little bro shopping cause no one has done that yet and i'm pretty much the only one around who can.  hopefully i can do that early tomorrow night and get it out of the way...cause i really don't want to be shopping anytime this weekend.  not much else is going on here.  i want to get my grades...but then again i don't.  they'll probably come in the mail right before the new year.  it's like some cruel joke.  they send your grades and then they print a little note on the bottom telling you to have a happy holiday.  it just make you feel so much better.  anyway, i'm tired of writing, so i'm going to go watch some tv. mmmm...tv.  ok, bye."

"event","Tonight Colleen told me something that got me thinking about my roommate.  Last night, this kid Chris (he lives down the hall) came into her room looking for some food.  Susie and Chris went to high school together and Susie always made it seem like they were friends.  She didn't go to a big school, so we always assumed they probably were.  Well, Chris told Colleen that he was never really friends with Susie and he thought that most of her friends were pretty dumb (not as in stupid dumb, but kind of ridiculous dumb maybe).  He didn't ever want to be friends with them and that's why he hasn't really made an effort to be friends with Susie this year even though he lives down the hall because he associates her with those people from high school.  I don't know, it just made me think of how different Susie and I are sometimes.  I mean, we get along really well and we do have fun together, which is why I am planning on living with her again next year.  I guess we just had very different high school experiences and sometimes its really hard for me to understand why she acts the way she does and says the things she says.  From my experience, her life is filled with drama,drama that from my perspective, isn't drama at all.  She makes a big deal out of things that really aren't that big a deal, at least not to me and for the most part not for colleen either.  Its hard to explain.  I don't want to say that I am more mature than she is, but I think the fact that I went to a huge high school helped me put things into persepctive a bit better.  I mean, sometimes I compare the way Colleen and I think to the way Susie thinks and it is a lot different.  Colleen and I both went to large high schools, where as Susie went to a school where every one knew every one else and she can name every one in her graduating class.  I think it has had an effect on the way she reacts to things in college.

This is going to seem a little odd, but for instance, Colleen and I sometimes can't understand the things that Susie has on her wall.  She puts some weird stuff on there.  I mean, she has some pictures of friends, but she also has pictures of what appear to be patterns that she made out of beads sitting on a table.  She always complains and gets depressed that she doesn't have a boyfriend, yet she makes collages that are all about love and soulmates and stuff.  When she talks to her friends on the phone or online, there is always some huge drama going on and a lot of times she goes out in the hall and talks for hours.  When she tells me what is going on...I always look at her kind of like ""oh...that's all?"".  One of the biggest things that confuses me and I don't know how to talk to her about it, is her relationships with guys.  From what Susie has told me, she didn't really have many male friends in high school.  So once a guy sort of shows interest in her, even if it is just as a friendship relationship, she kind of latches on and doesn't let go for long periods of time....long periods. She has a friend Matt back home who goes to school in Georgia.  He had a girlfriend, but for some reason, although he and Susie are good friends, she was convinced that he had feelings for her.  She would write about how she loved him in her profile and stuff and call him all the time.  Then she would get really mad and upset when he didn't call her back or if he didn't talk to her online.  Ever since I have met her, all the guys she has developed fairly decent relationships with, she has assumed that there is an element of romance there and it is nearely impossible to convince her there isn't.  I don't know, I don't want to make it sound like she is an idiot, its just hard sometimes because I don't know how to tell her what I am thinking about a situation without hurting her feelings.  For awhile, she was convinced that she was going to have a relationships with one of colleen's friends who is a drummer in a punk band.  Colleen kept trying to tell her that he wasn't interested and that perhaps she wasn't his type (he really wasn't...at all)  For months we tried to convince her of this, but she just couldn't understand.  In the meantime, colleen had to try to avoid interactions with him and had to try to keep the band's shows a secret because she didn't want Susie to come and get all wrapped up in the relationship she thought was going to happen.  She couldn't have him come visit because she was afraid Susie would be hanging all over him all night and try to sleep with him.  The fact of the matter was that he had a girlfriend and told colleen that he was not interested in Susie at all.  It took her months to get over that, but now she is having the same trouble with her friend matt.  I don't know, I think maybe its easier for colleen and i to really see whats going on because we have had more interactions with people and more interactions with different people.  It's hard for me to understand how Susie can't see whats really going on.  And I'll admit, sometimes it bothers me.

Sometimes i just want to sit and talk with her and tell her that life doesn't have to be filled with such insignificant drama and that there is a difference between a friendship and a relationship.  Don't get me wrong, I like Susie and I like being her roommate and friend, I just can't understand why she acts that way she does sometimes and how she thinks the way she does.  It bothers me when she walks around the room totally pissed off, not talking to anyone, putting up grumpy away messages and won't talk to me about what's going on.  And then when she finally does, I find out she is mad because Matt told that she didn't need to respond to an apology letter her friend wrote her over winter break for not inviting her to the beach 2 summers ago.  I don't know, it all seems so ridiculous to me and sometimes I just feel like I can't relate to that.  

Anyway, I just needed to vent a little bit of my thinking somewhere.  Maybe I'll talk to Susie sometime about all this. Of course maybe its really none of my business.  Anyway, I gotta go do some more work now.  Perhaps I shall return.  LAter dudes."

"event","So yeah...i realized I haven't written in here in a way long time.  But then shannon wanted to start an account, and you have to pay unless someone invites you, so i invited her. So yeah, that was a pretty bad story, but I decided to tell it anyway.  Not much is going on here.  Pretty much just doing the whole second year of college thing.  My schedule is pretty good.  I am getting fit monday, wednesday, and friday at 10 and I have a study of jazz class which is pretty cool.  My other two classes are actually really hard, but I think I'll survive.

I think I am going to try (key word:try) to write in this more often.  It would take me forever to play catch up, so I am just going to write what happened today.  I had a nice workout this morning, and then I went to lunch with some ho's (susie and shannon). I was supposed to have my study of jazz class, but my prof. was out so it was cancelled.  So I came back to my room and susie and I watched a lifetime movie.  It was a good one.  Then I sat around and copied music off the network.  Then I went to dinner with some ho's (susie, colleen, and shannon).  Shannon had to leave and she managed to leave right as her ""boy"" was coming in.  She thinks this kid is a total dork, but he has nice hair and she has this weird crush on him.  Of course, she doesn't know his name or anything, but...eh...it doesn't matter.  We saw him sign up at the frat rush table....so maybe he is trying to un-dorkify himself, however, it could result in him becoming a total jack ass.  

We went to the mall tonight.  It was nothing really exciting, since the mall closes at 9.  I didn't find the shirt I was looking for, but oh well.  Right now we are looking for something else to do. As you can tell, we live the wild life here.  But actually,we have a lot of fun so I'm not complaining.  

Alright, that's enough for now.  I think I am going to do something else.  Later dudes."

"event","Howdy folks!!  not much is going on here,  but i thought i would post.  so yeah...about nmy dysfuctional family (the ones in maine).  so my cousin's internet boyfriend who is 3 years older than her is moving back to utah....and my cousin is going with him.  thank god she has a 9th grade education.  yeah...we figure we'll never see her again.  she'll get pregnant and that'll be that.  i just feel bad because my grandparents have given them so much money over the years.  they freakin' bought their house for them...and now look at them....they are white trash and not doing a damn thing with themselves.  i don't know how my cousin thinks she is going to survive with a 9th grade education and a boyfriend who installs cable.  when my grandfather was alive, he used to get angry at my aunt and try to make her see all the bad decisions she was making, but now that he is gone, my grandmother is too afraid and she just keeps her mouth shut.  i mean, my aunt and uncle are on the verge of divorce because my aunt is a fat, lazy slob who sits in front of the computer all day playing cribbage.  she doesn't shower and she is very overwieght.  meanwhile, my cousin had her internet boyfriend move in with them from utah without even ever meeting him...and now she is moving back to utah with him....she is only 17 and my aunt doesn't seem to realize that she has the authority to make her stay.  but then again, my aunt doesn't really give a crap.  the sad part is, i don't really care if i ever see them again.  they make me angry.  my grandparents seriously gave them money for everything and then my uncle had to sell this land he had in order to pay off my aunt's $12,000 credit card debt.  i feel bad for my uncle.  hopefully after my cousin moves out, he'll be divorcing my aunt....i can only hope.  my mom doesn't even really talk to her...and its her own sister.  i just hate them because they make my grandmother so upset and ashamed.  she cries over them all the time and about what's happening.  grr...i just hate them.
    anyway, that is what i'm thinking about right now.  work was boring today...but i made it through.  maybe we'll all get together and hang out tonight...that would be stellar.  anyway...today was not too shabby.  i talked to colleen online.  we had a good talk.  i miss that girl...but i'll be seing her soon!! SU the sequal is just around the corner.  later dudes!!"

"event","yo.  well, i know i haven't written in here in a long time, so here it goes. not much has been going on except work....its boring as all hell...but i get $10 an hour so no complaints here (actually i complain every day, but i always go anyway).  Susis came to visit on friday and she left yesterday...we had a blast...and i finally made it to the jersey shore!!!!!  it was everything i ever dreamed....exceot for the extreme sunburn that has crippled me.  it really was a lot of fun though...now i want to go back.  anyway, the firday night that susie got here we pretty much just hung out...mike joined us.  it was fun, but we were driving around and i sort of got upset.  i didn't want to get upset while susie was in the car, so i eventually had to take him home.  susie decided to stay at my house and just get ready for bed. so i had pretty much gotten over it, but mike was angry about something. so i asked him what was wrong and for some reason (i couldn't really get him to explain it) he was upset because i had been so excited about susie coming and i guess he felt like i was ignoring him or something like that, but i'm really not sure.  then we got to talking about me and him in the car together.  i get upset alot when mike is in the car with me because he tends to criticize the way i drive.  i know i'm not the best driver in the world...but it has gotten to the point that i get so nervous when he is in the car with me that i do stupid things and then he just criticizes me even more.  i just wish he wouldn't be so critical of the little things that i do differently than he does.  i just always feel so stupid when i am in the car with him, i feel like he is my driving instructor or something.  anyway...we got into a big argument about it and we were outside. we haven't argued in a long time and we actually got pretty loud. we were outside until his mom came out and told us to quiet down and come inside.  so we did and we tried to talk things out, but we really weren't getting very far.  mrs.z was sitting there trying to help us. i'll admit it, she was taking my side pretty much because she knows the way mike can be sometimes, especially when it comes to driving.  mike get so angry really fast though, so sometimes it is hard to just sit and talk with him about things like this.  he does recognize that he sometimes has a problem with anger management though and he wants to get better.  after about 2.5 hours of talking, we finally worked things out and came to an understanding of what each of us was saying.  it ended on a good note.  i really hate when we argue, and i admit that sometimes it is over really, really petty and stupid things, yet i think this was something that needed to be talked about and i am glad that we finally were able to talk about it even though we had to yell at eachother first. 
like i said, i really don't like when we argue sometimes, but we are always able to talk about it and that is really important.  we have been through a lot of stuff after the past 2 years, especially with me being at college and us being away from each other for months at a time.  i think it only makes us stronger.  there are a lot of people out there who would probably brag because they're in a relationship where they never argue, but i am glad that mike and i do argue from time to time.  it makes us stronger and it makes us better at dealing with the things that are destined to come up sometime in the future.  the fact that mike and i can argue, talk something out, and make it better, just makes me think that what we have is something really, really awesome.  anyway, things are better now and after driving to the shore with mike sitting next to me and not hearing one critical remark makes me feel even better.

so yeah, susie was here and we had a good time. our room is going to be so awesome this year.  we were making all these plans and thinking about our schedules and stuff.  all the talk about school really made me want to go back.  its not that i don't like hanging out with all my friends here (you guys rock!), but i am just ready to do the whole college thing again for awhile (well...except for the whole class thing) i think i am juist ready for school again.  yet, there are plenty more good times to be had here at home and i am planning on taking full advantage of them.  school will be here before i know it.

so as far as today...i went to work (i had to stay a little late to play catch up since i took monday off to hang out with susie)...then i came home and talked to mike for a few mintues...then my sister came over so i was hanging out with her...we ate dinner...and now i am here (dinner + talking to the fam took quite some time).  i think i might hit the sack early tonight so i actually feel rested tomorrow. well...hopefully i'll remember to keep writing in this thinger.  leter dudes!!"

"event","wow...i haven't written in this thing since april...i figured i'd drop a line.  not much is going on...if you want to know what all has gone on in the past few weeks since i have been home, just read beth's journal.  we've had some good times.  i've pretty much been doing everything that she has...we've just been hanging around a lot with the gang.  if i am not with beth, kelly, etc...than i am usually with mike.  well...minus the hours between 9 and 3 that i spend at work coding bills and putting them in the computer (ooo thrilling).  the summer has been rockin' so far though.  the fez is this friday!!!!!! and i just got tickets to go see weezer and dashboard confessional at the end of july!!!!!!!! like i said though, if you really want to know the details of my social life, just read beth's entry...we pretty much have done the same things...well...except i didn't go to see her crotchety grandmother :).  so i'll write about something that wasn't already talked about.

things with mike and i have been a little hectic lately.  i don't know if hectic is the right word, but thats the best i could do for right now.  we seem to be getting in stupid arguments all of a sudden.  i came to the conclusion though that we are both just frustrated.  i am frustrated because i missed him so much while i was away at school, and now that i am home, i just want to be with him, but i can't because he has to go to school ecvery day.  he is frustrated because he just doesn't want to be in school anymore.  its just frustrating for both of us because we want things that just can't happen right now because of our schedules.  i mean, things aren't horrible or anything.  we see eachother a lot and for the most part, things are awesome, we have just been getting more testy than usual the past few weeks.  but he only has a week and a half before graduation so things are going to be better.

i guess thats not the whole story though.  i get frustrated a lot about his job.  i work a simple 9-3 weekday job and he doesn't, which makes it kind of hard to plan things.  its not that i can't deal with that though, its not the working in retail part that really bothers me...its the place that he works that bothers me.  He has been working at aero for over a year and half now and he is treated like crap.  he is pretty much a manager, but he only gets paid 8.25 an hour, while some other girl who is just a regular clerk person makes 10...why you ask?...just because the main manager likes her more.  half the time, he gets called in when he is not supposed to be working, he gets scheduled to work when he requested off, he doesn't get more than a 15 minute break for a long shift...and he is usually there for at least an hour and a half after the store closes.  it just makes me mad because he works hard and all he gets is crap.  i went to see him last night at work and instead of his usual 30 min break, he only got 15. he was already tired and  he hadn't eaten anything all day.  he was angry because of work and i could tell that he was way stressed out.  he told me he would give me a call when he got home.  i heard from him at 9:15...over 2 hours after the mall closes on sunday.  i'm sorry, but there is no reason for him to have to stay that long.  he has finals coming up this week and he is not sleeping or eating right, and he has about double the amount of stress that he should have.  i'm just really worried about him.  i just hate the way work makes him.  it stresses him out so much and he doesn't need that crap.  i am just worried that he is going to get sick or something.  like i said, aero just sucks...they always screw him over and i hate what it does to him.  he told me about a month ago that he was tired of it too and he was going to try to find a new job...but then he didn't say anything about it.  he kept working and putting up with all kinds of crap.  now he finally seems to be looking for a new job.  i don't care if he gets another job in retail, i just want it to be somewhere that he doesn't get screwed over all the time and doesn't cause him so much stress.  i am just really worried about him right now. 

anyway, enough about that.  today was a usual boring day at work...of course its $10 an hour so i'm not complaining.  other than that, nothing is going on...but THE FEZ IS THIS WEEKEND!!!!!!!! woohoo..i can't wait!!! just as long as i don't have to deal with tim and andy acting like complete idiots and smoking up...if they do...they can find their own way home because i don't want to deal with it.  well...i think i am going to go to the awards thingy tonight for mike... but i have no details so perhaps i should give hime a call.  later kids!"

"event","I really only have about 5 minutes to write at this current time, but i thought i would post something really quick.  So things sort of suck right now.  Susie, Colleen, and i found out yesterday that we didn't get the triple we wanted next year so we didn't really know what to do.  we had to apply early, but by now pretty much every one has decided who they are living with even though the lottery isn't until next week.  So colleen spent that night searching for anyone reasonable who doesn't have a roommate.  Finally she talked to one of her current roommates friends and they decided that they are going to live together next year.  It was good that we worked it out, but yet it sucks like a mother fo that the three of us aren't going to be able to live together next year.  So anyway, susie and i are going to live together and colleen is going to live with this girl shannon.

Other than that, i just have a out a billion things to do in the next few (but final) weeks of school.  I have 2 major papers, 1 project, and 2 presentations.  plus i am working on a literary magazine and planning a seminar that is next weekend.  I have had no time for anything but doing work.  oh and...i got a 48 on my last calc test, luckily she drops our lowest grade.  I feel like i have been doing work forever and it sucks.  I don't get to talk to anyone anymore.  I just keep telling myself that i just have 4 more weeks.

But....my boy mikey is coming this saturday to see me!!!!!  I have been working way hard this week so that i can get things done before tomorrow.  He has bene planning top come for a long time and it is the only thing i have to look forward to until the end of the year so there is no way i was going to let school get in the way of that.  I worked my ass off this week and tomorrow is going to be my mikey break.

anyway, i have to go see mrs,harrison for help with my calc lab...blah...and then i have to go to the library...so i'll catch y'all later.  i miss you guys.  see you in a few weeks!!!"

I have meetings all the time because now that we are coming up on the end of the year (woohoo!!!!), we need to get things done.  It kind of sucks, but i guess its better than being bored.  Anyway, other than being busy, things are going alright.  I have come to the comclusion that Mike doesn't know how to mail letters...or else his mailman hates him.  Only about half of the stuff he sends me actaully gets here.  His mom sent me a card yesterday and it got here today, he sent one 2 days ago and it hasn't gotten here.  if it doesn't get here within 2 days, than it won't come.  Seriously, only half of the things he has sent me actually get here...it just sucks because i always get disappointed.

Anyway, nothing else is really going on. last night colleen and i really wanted donuts so we made susie take us to dunkin donuts.  it was yummy...but i didn't go to bed until 1.  I have to go see mrs. harrison this afternoon because our lab makes NO sense. I am totally lost about it...and i hate calc.  Thats about it..perhaps i will write more later, but right now i have to get some stuff done.  talk to you folks later!"

"event","If there is one thing that I will share with my kids when I have a family, it's that life never works out the way you plan.  You can try as hard as you want to make things work out the way you want, but they rarely ever do.  Instead you are left feeling shitty and crappy and like you have let down the best friends you have ever had.  You cry for awhile and think that you'll never get over it, but then you realize that crying does you no good because it can't fix or change any of the decisions you've made.  So you stop crying and if you are like me, you write about it...well, at least you write about how you feel.  I'm not saying that life sucks, I'm just saying that sometimes being optimistic doesn't pay off.  I wish life was easier, but it's not.  I'm just glad I have people around to help me make it through."

"event","I know I haven't written in quite awhile, but I have been extremely busy.  Last week I felt like I was always working.  I felt like I got a lot accomplished though so I guess that's good.  I also had like a gazillion meetings last week for different clubs and stuff.  Yeah....I had a calc test too...and I lab to do which took about two million years to do.  That's right...two million years.  Anyway, things are going alright here I guess.  I got a letter the other day telling me that I made Dean's list this semester and I found out that I am in the top ten percent of my class.  So that made me feel good.  You can call me a nerd if you want, but I don't care.  My parents are paying lots of money for me to be here I think the least I could do is do my best.  Not to mention the fact that I want to do something with my life and be successful.  I guess that fact that my roommate is a total waste of space makes me want to work a little harder.  She makes me realize how stupid it is to sit on your ass and not to anything and watch your life waste away.  There is no way in hell I want to be anything like that.  Plus, like I said, I want to be something.  Anyway, I have a good Lesley story to share.
     
Okay, so Lesley has kind of been seeing this kid jeff.  She randomly leaves late at night to ""go for a walk"" with him.  She has been hanging out with him a lot lately.  This is the same kid that I found laying on our couch inder MY blanket the day I came back from Penn State with Mike.  Well..then she decided that she didn't want a relationship with him because she would rather have sex with her ex-boyfriend Darren.  After she told Jeff this, she kept hanging out with him all the time anyway.  Well...eventually they mnade out and became a couple.  Well...she didn't even tell us they were a ""couple"" until they she broke up with him 5 days later.  Then last night she went to talk to him...and she ened up going to his frat and getting totally trashed.  When I woke up this morning she was not in our room.  I woke up my computer to find a message from jeff telling me that lesley was really messed up and she was spending the night with him.  See...but here is the kicker...Jeff's frat house is literally like right across the parking lot from our building.  Jeff is only a sophomore so he doesn't live in the house, he lives basically across campus.  If Lesley was so drunk, why didn't she just have jeff walk her back to our building?  What I am trying to say is...Lesley is a drunken whore.  Oh...and here is the other funny thing.  We went to friendly's last night and there was this group of like white trash townies at the table behind us.  They were being really obnoxious.  If I was the waitress I would have told them to get out.  But anyway, we were making comments about them being white trash and talking about how one of the frats was having a ""white trash mixer"" last night where you had to come dressed as white trash.  So when Lesley was getting dressed for the party she was going to, she put on this really tight, ugly, whore shirt and told us that she ""wanted to stay with the whole white trash theme"".  So pretty much she told us that she looked like white trash..and she wasn't even going to the mixer.  Man...she is such a loser.  

Other than that, I don't really have any good stories.  I have just been really busy with class and stuff this past week.  I am on the planning commitee for the sleeping bag seminar that we are holding here in april and I am also on the staff for a new literary magazine that we are starting this year. It should be fun.  Plus I am working with the rest of the english club officers to put together our valentine's day fundraiser.  We are making poetry grams that people can send through campus mail to their friends and significant others and stuff.  Hopefully we'll make a decent amount of money.  Also, despite the fact that I can't meet with my study buddy this semester, I am still involved in the program so I have to go do different stores in the area and try to get donations for door prizes for the study buddy spaghetti dinner.  It should be a good time..the spaghetti dinner that is.  Yeah so between all this and getting my work done, I am pretty busy. It's good though.  I would rather have a lot of stuff to do than sit on my ass all day.  Plus, being busy makes the time go faster.  

Yeah...so anyone who is curious about my Nancy Drew quotes, I got this really awesome book 2 weeks ago called ""Nancy Drew's Guide to Life"".  It is so funny.  It has all these quotes from Nancy Drew books...they are just so funny.  My brother was said that he reads them every day and thinks they are hysterical.  He wants to see the book...so does my mom since she grew up on Nancy Drew.  She thinks it sounds funny.  My mom is weird sometimes.  Every time I call her, she talks for SOOOO long.  I mean, it's not that I don't like talking to my mom, its just that she talks FOREVER!!!  I guess I shouldn't be complaining though because I do miss my parents in some weird way.  Sometimes I wish I was closer to my mom, but I'm just not.  I look at Mike and how close he is to his mom and how he talks to her about almost everything.  Sometimes I wish I had that, but my mom isn't really that kind of person. I just don't feel comfortable talking to my mom about a lot of stuff.  I guess maybe the fact that my mom had four kids makes it hard to get really close to all of us.  And then there is my dad.  My relationship with my dad is just really weird.  Sometimes I really hate him for the way he acts, but then sometimes he is really cool.  Like sometimes he will scream at me for spilling a glass of milk at the dinner table and then other times I will come down for breakfast on the weekends and he will give me a big hug.  Mrs. Z said something one time about me being my dad's favorite.  I thought about it and I didn't really know what to think.  I mean, sometimes I think that maybe I am, but sometimes I don't.  I am the only one of my siblings who has a nickname.  My dad has been calling me peaches since I was a baby and he still does.  Not all the time, but pretty regularly.  It's weird.  Sometimes I think my dad talks to me more than he does to everyone else.  But I really don't know.  My dad is just weird.  He called the other day and was talking to me about Lesley.  It was odd.  

Anyway, enough about my parents.  My brother's girlfriend had the cutest away message up the other day.  It said ""at the movies with the cute boy from room 402"".  I thought it was the cutest thing.  I am really happy for them. That is one thing that my brother and I have in common.  We have both been lucky enough to find someone really special.  I will never forget the time Alyssa made a comment about it being ""disgusting"" that Audrey and Jon have been going out since their freshman year.  Yeah...I think she is bitter.  She likes Audrey though and she likes Mike too.  She thinks he is ""alternative"".  But I remember that Jon was pretty mad when she made that comment. I was too.  Sometimes she can be a real bitch.  Geeze...whats with me and talking about my family.  I'll stop now.

I really miss everyone from back home.  This week I was going through a lot of crap from Lesley and there were a few days when I just wanted to come home and get away from her.  I got through it alright though.  Thanks to everyone for helping me...you guys are the best.  And I have to thank Mike for putting up with me getting upset on the phone. I don't know what I would do without him.  I'm in love with him and he means the world to me.  I've been realizing lately that I am really the luckiest girl in the world.  I have an absolutely perfect boyfriend, the most awesome friends that anyone could ever ask for (ones that I wouldn't trade for anything in the world), and I am getting a good education so that I can go out and be successful doing what I love.  I don't think anything beats it.  I just can't thank all the people in my life enough for being so amazing.  Thank you.  I miss all of you guys so much, but I know we'll be together again before you know it.  

oh...and to all of those who are interested...I managed to find the elusive ""Hidden Spring"" for a second time!!!  Actually..I just saw a stand of ""hidden spring"" water, but it made me think of you guys.  I miss you!!"

"event","I'm am taking some time out from doing all my work to post tonight.  All I have left to do is write a 1.5-2 page paper on my observations of people eating.  It'll take me about 5 minutes.  Anyway, this weekend was pretty exciting.  I had to get a lot of my work done on friday because I went to Penn State with Mike and his mom to stay with his sister.  Mike had an audition at SU on saturday morning so thats why he came in the first place.  He got here at about 9 in the morning...he told me he was going to be here at 8 so I got out of bed and everything...thanks a lot Mike....;)Then he had his audition at 9:30 so Mrs. Z and I went to get some coffee at the caf.  We sat and talked until a little after ten.  It was a good time...we talked about all kinds of stuff.  Then we went downtown to go to this really neat store.  I have bought mrs.Z 2 things from there and she wanted me to take her...so we went.  We were there until around 11.  The store is pretty big and there are definitely a lot of things to look at.  She definitely found a lot of stuff that she wanted.  We went to some other stores too.  All in all, it was a really fun morning and I got to spend some time hanging out with Mrs.Z...she told me some stories about Mike...it was funny.  Then Mike called to let us know that he was done his audition, so we went back to SU to get him.  After getting something to eat, we headed to Penn State.  Mrs.Z was really worried because it was snowing pretty hard here and she thought the roads were going to be really bad.  Mike felt that his audition went really well and considering that was the whole reason he was here in the first place, it made me feel really good.

Well, the roads weren't bad and as we got closer to Penn State, it was actually snowing less.  I guess I never really realized how much Mike talks until we were in the car...you would think after all the trips we have been on together I would have realized that...but he made things entertaining and we definitely did a lot of laughing.  When he got out of the car to pump gas....his mom talked about him...she is so funny.  They both cracked me up.  Once we got to Christy's apartment (Mrs.z didn't really know how to get there...it was amusing)...we just sat and chatted for awhile.  Mike made himself look really stupid when he asked ""what's a bookmark?""...we all got a good laugh out of that one...hehe...I love Mike.  Then we went shopping around state college and ate dinner.  It was a really fun afternoon.

After dinner, we went back to christy's and chatted and such.  Eventually we decided we waited long enough and it was time to celebrate Mike's birthday.  Christy had made a cake and she and I gave Mike our presents.  Christy made him a big, warm blanket to match the pillow she made him for christmas....and well...to put it simply..I gave him comic books.  We pretty much just hung out the rest of the night...watching football and talking.  It was a lot of fun though.  Everyone went to bed around midnight, but Mike and I stayed up and talked for awhile after that.  I just really wanted to talk to him about some stuff.  I dunno, I just wanted to let him know how much I love him and miss him when we're not together.  After we said goodnight, I went to bed while Mike slept on the couch. He gave me his eagles blanket to sleep with (I love that blanket). I came back about a half hour later though, just because I was thinking about him...and because something in the other room was making a really loud chirping noise...and because I needed a tissue.  I walked in and stood looking at Mike sleeping.  He woke up and I scared the crap out of him.  It was pretty funny.  We talked for another 2 seconds...I don't really think Mike had any idea what he was saying...he was pretty much still asleep.  Then he fell back to sleep and I just sat down and watched him sleep for awhile until I got really tired.  I went back to bed and slept with my pillow over my head.

The next morning, Mike woke me up and laughed at me because my hair was all messed up.  I was all warm and I didn't want to get out of bed.  It was nice to have Mike wake me up...a change from the usual alarm clock.  He looked really cute in his pajamas with his hair all messed up...I was amused.  Once I finally got up, we went and sat on the couch while everyone took showers and stuff.  I fell asleep on Mike's lap again...I seem to do that a lot.  Of course, after I took a shower, he fell asleep on my lap...so we're even.  Of course all good things must come to an end and we had to leave.  I fell asleep on the car ride home, but Mike woke me up just as we got to ""Puff"" my favorite cigarrette outlet next to the christian bookstore.  I started crying because I had such a good weekend and I knew that I won't be seeing Mike again for another month.  Once we got back to SU, we went to BJ's for some food...it was fun and I managed to flip my soup spoon out of my bowl and onto the floor...yay me!!  Then we walked back to campus and I had to say goodbye.  That is always the worst part.  I cry every time, even though I know I will see him again.  Its just hard when you have so much fun and then you have to say goodbye for another month.  Although Mike did give me his eagles blanket to keep me warm and remind me of him.  That blanket is magic...no matter how cold it is...that blanket will keep you warm.  

Eventually I said goodbye to Michael and he and his mom left.  Man...I hate saying goodbye.  As soon as I got back to my room I wrapped myself in the blanket.  I don't think I can even put into words what this weekend meant to me...I really can't.  It was just an awesome weekend.  I love Mike so much.

Anyway, needless to say...when Mike and I walked into my room when we got back on sunday...this guy jeff was laying under MY STRIPED BLANKET!!!! on the ""couch"".  Susie informed me that Lesley got totally smashed saturday night and jeff spent the night.  Yeah...talk about being pissed off...yeah...i can never use that blanket again...good thing mike gave me his.  If she ever pulls that crap again I'm going to pull out a can of whoop-ass.  She still doesn't do work...surprise, surprise...and so much for her not drinking and not going to parties...she sure is a star student.  We don't think she will be here after mid-term.  

Other than that, nothing is really going on here.  Classes are going well and I am looking forward to reading Nancy Drew in a couple of weeks.  Sorry for writing about all that mushy stuff that you guys probably don't care about...it was my weekend and it was what I am thinking about right now....I just wanted to write about it.  I miss all of you guys tons. but we'll be together again before you know it!!  Goodnight!!"

"event","Bonjour!!  Well...not much has been happening lately.  I was really worried about Mike the other day because he was in a little accident and he was really, really upset.  He backed into someone (hmm...sounds kind of like someone else I know ;))  He was really upset about it because he thought his dad was going to kill him and his parents were going to think he was irresponsible.  He was afraid it was going to cost him tons of money and his insurance rates were going to go way up.  I was very worried about him.  I tried to assure him that things were going to be ok and that his parents were not going to hate him. Accidents happen and as much of a cliche as it is, nobody is perfect.  Mike is under a lot of stress since auditions are coming up and its the end of the marking period, not to mention he hasn't been feeling well for a few days and he hasn't been getting a lot of sleep.  I think it just all caught up with him.  Things like that happen to everyone though and I tried to assure him the best I could that things were going to be alright and that I love him.  Well...he didn't get a chance to talk to me until later that night...at like 11:30.  Everything is ok.  His parents weren't mad at him and the accident was not bad at all. They are just going to give the other guy some money to pay for it and not get insurance involved so its all good.  I was so glad to hear from him and know that things were ok.  I was really scared for awhile.  So things are good now and Mike is a bit more relaxed now.

Other than that, not much else is happening.  We went to wal-mart the other day and got a cheap air mattress, some sheets, and cheap pillows to make our pseudo-futon.  It is really cool and comfy.  Our room is definitely the hot pad.  My  classes are alright.  Detective Fictiona nd Film is probably my best class.  Its a lot of reading, but the books are actually entertaining so its nice.  We also get to read a Nancy Drew book!!  Mike asked me why we aren't reading the Hardy Boys and the only reason is simply that girls are better!!  Hehe...anyway, calc sucks my ass and my other classes aren't too bad.  I get to to go NY for Thought and Civilization.  We are going to Chinatown to eat at a chinese restaurant and then we are going to the metropolitan museum of art to see and exhibit on asian art.  It should be fun.  We are starting the semester by learning about food and how it relates to culture and stuff....it made me think of you beth ;)Next week we are going to the susquehanna valley mall to waldenbooks to look at different cookbooks...it should be a party.  Anwyay, I have to get ready to go to class.  Not much else is going on here, but I miss everyone immensely.  I get to see Mike this weekend because he has his audition here and then we are going to hang out with his sis at PSU.  I can't wait...its going to be a blast!!!  Later!!"

Michell's furniture was gone when I got here yesterday and Lesley set everything up and got a carpet.  We have so much room!!  We definitely have a hot pad.  As for Lesley..she seems to have realized that she needs to do work.  She told me she can't go to any parties and she doesn't want to because she could get busted and because when she goes to parties she sleeps all weekend and doesn't do her work.  So far things have been good and we've been having fun...and our room looks totally awesome.  We are going to get a cheap air mattress or inflatable couch or something to put on the floor and cover it with a sheet and some pillows so it is kind of like a couch.  It'll be cool.  I just can't believe how much room we have...everyone wants to come hang out in the hot pad 231.  Anyway...I miss everyone, but school is nice.  I like having a schedule and feeling like I have a purpose.  It is kind of nice.  Of course...I have calc homework already...boo...I don't even have my book yet...I should probably get on that.  Well...I have to go prepare myself for the best class I have: Detective Fiction and Film...it should be pretty cool.  Perhaps I will check in again later."

"event","Hmm....much like Beth...the weather blows so I have been quite bored.  Although I did have a dream...I don't remember much about it and it wasn't nearly as good as beth's...but I'm sure beth will love to hear who made an appearance in it.  Yeah...so I was with some people, but I don't remember where we were or even who I was with...but we were at some restaurant and Heidi Wilson came in and sat with us.  Now....I haven't even thought about her in months so I would like to know how the hell she appeared in my dream.  She looked exactly like she did last time I saw her back in 8th grade...so in other words she looked like an overused prostitute.  All I remember is her stringy blonde hair gettting all over my food and making me want to vomit.  Yeah...Heidi Wilson was quite a whore.  I just remember when gregg and I were in Europe we met some girls who went to her school and they asjed if we ever knew here.  Gregg couldn't even talk about it because she used to stalk him and she always though he was in love with her.  Haha...Heidi...she lied a lot.  Man...she was good for a laugh.  well...that was a pretty bad story...but anyway....I thought Heidi appearing in my dream was somewhat amusing.

Anyway, today was def boring. I woke up...watched some tv...took a shower...whatched a movie.  Then Mike called and asked me to come over so I did.  It was fun...I hit him with a snowball to pay him back for hitting me in the face with a ball of ice last year.  Of course that was supposed to be repayment for the time I hit him in the ""unmentionables"".  Yeah...good times, good times.  Well...I am babbling about nothing now, so I am going to stop typing and talk to Kelly."

"event","Well, well...this is going to be a long one.  Anyway, last night I went to Kelly's for a good old fashioned game night.  It was a lot of fun and catch phrase could possibly be the best game ever...well..except maybe for Racko.  Anyway, we all had a good time and I'm with Kelly...Trivial Pursuit always makes me feel like an idiot...especially when you play with a kid who is almost getting a free ride to Penn.  But then again...I guess I have better things to do than fill my head with useless trivia...no offense to anyone who is really good at that game.  I'm getting good grades in college and thats good enough for me.  Well anyway, before we Mike and I got to Kelly's house we had kind of been in the middle of a discussion about what my plans are for ASP this summer.  I know I want to go, but I have a decision to make and I don't know what to do.

See, here is the problem.  I can go on the college trip or I can be a crew leader for the high school trip.  If I go on the high school trip, I would get to be with Mike and Hilf.  That would be cool, but Mike isn't even sure if he will be able to go at all because he might have to go to school during the summer.  Other than those two, I'm not good friends with anyone else from my youth group because they kind of have their little clics and stuff.  I mean I talk to other people, but I can't say I'm really friends with them.  Yet if Mike can go, I want to go with him because well...ASP is something that I have done with him for the past two summers and it would just be weird without him.  I would still have Hilf though and that would be nice.  The other thing about it is that I would feel out of place in a way because I would be a crew leader, yet I would be hanging out mostly with Mike and Hilf.  I wouldn't really fit in as a youth or an adult...I don't know...I just think I would feel a little bit uncomfortable.  

On the other hand, I don't really know who is going on the college trip.  I mean if it is just people like Carol Crimmons and Rob Hettel...I think I would kill myself.  Christy isn't sure what she is doing yet either.  So I don't know really who I would hang out with, yet I would feel more comfortable simply because of the age of the people on the trip and the fact that I wouldn't be a leader.  Of course...if I had the opportunity to go with Mike and Hilf I would want to take it, but there are no guarantees.  I just don't know what to do and I got upset about it last night after I left Kelly's house.

Mike and I left at about 11:30...and we sat in my car talking until about 12:45.  I was crying...not just about ASP...but about some other stuff too.  I don't know...I lost it last night.  I felt horrible for putting Mike in such a bad position because I really did lose it last night.  But he was awesome and he talked to me about everything.  I was still upset when I left, but I went home and stayed up until 2:30 writing because that's what I do when I'm upset.  It helped a lot, but I still didn't sleep very well because I thought I was going to have to make a decisiona about ASP this morning.  I still wasn't sure what to do about that.

This morning Mike had to do the soundboard at 7:15, so I got up and met him there.  We talked some more about everything and he read what I stayed up writing to him last night.  Don't fret...we're not having problems in our relationship...there were just some things I have been thinking about that I wanted him to know.  It was nice just to be able to sit there with him.  

After the service we both went home, but then I had to go back to church to get my registration papers for ASP.  I realized that I didn't have to sign up today, I just had to get the forms.  While I was there, I talked to Christy and Mrs. Z, along with Tim and Lisa.  Tim is planning on going on the college trip, but he isn't 100% sure...oh...and I talked to Kristin Webber who is also planning on going.  I talked to Lisa for awhile and she said that she is trying to get Jerry to come again this year, but that she herself isn't all that sure who all is going to be there and she doesn't want to go if she isn't going to have anyone to hang out with.  So perhaps today's conversations at church didn't really help me all that much.  Sign-ups are next week and Lisa and I decided that we are going to stand by the table and see who signs-up.  So when I left church...that was my plan.

Then Mike called me today and said that his mom came up with the idea that Mike and Hilf could come on the college trip.  Technically they will be old enough and the college crew is always in need of more people.  Hilf is going to talk to our pastor about it tonight and call Mike at work to see if it is ok.  I don't know...I mean that would be awesome if the two of them could come, but I don't want Mike to do it just because of me.  Of course, I have to admit that he and hilf are better friends with the people in college than the ones in high school.  I guess I just want them to make the right decision.

Yet...the more I think about it...the less it matters who I go with. I just want to go and help because thats what it is all about anyway.  I know I will make new friends no matter what so this decision should be easier than I am making it.  Oh yeah, but what I forgot to mention is that the college trip is the same week that my family is going to Maine.  I mean, my parents leave the choice up to me, but I don't really see how it makes any difference what I choose.  I am going to be working this summer and I don't really think its plausible that I will be able to take 2 full weeks off to go on the high school trip and go to Maine.  So I could go on the high school trip and just stay home the other week...or I could go on ASP while my family is in Maine...either way...I can't go to Maine.  Of course that doesn't really disappoint me too much because I have been there just about every summer of my life (its not that thrilling) and well...the family I have there is just dysfunctional.  I would rather go on ASP then to Maine because what I do on ASP is more important to me.  Like I said...my decision thus far has not become any clearer.

I am doing better today though.  I slept for awhile and I talked to Mike while he was on his break.  Plus...my sister came home because we are having spaghetti for dinner..mmmmmmm.  Mike might stop by after work, but the way the weather is looking I'm not so sure that is going to happen.  Its ok though...heck...maybe he won't have school tomorrow and he can stop by then!!  Anyway...I'm going to watch the Eagles game tonight even though the game doesn't mean anything.  I want it to snow...but if all this rain freezes under the snow...it is going to be hell in a handbasket to shovel it tomorrow.  Well...I think dinner is ready so I am going to go get myself some spaghetti!!"

"event","Well...I don't have that much to write today, but I just thought I would post something.  Last night Beth and I met up with Jon, Oscar, and Casey to see Ocean's Eleven.  Beth thought we should get there pretty early since it was sold out the last time she tried to go see it so we got there about 30 minutes early. Well, there was pretty much no one there...but we got a good laugh out of it.  The movie was excellent and it was fun to hang out with Jon, Oscar, and Casey...it was a good time.  

I was extremely unproductive today.  I think I spent my day doing absolutely nothing...but its ok because I am on break and I am allowed to do nithing...its ok if I keep telling myself that.  Anyway, Mike came over at about 4 to pick me up so we could go to the jeweler to get my ring sized.  It wasn't all that thrilling, but at least I got to spend some time with him.  We couldn't really hang out though because he had to work tonight.  We're going to do something once he gets off work tonight unless something else is going on tonight...but I really have no idea.  

Other than that, nothing new is happening so I am going to go read my book now...or maybe I'll talk online...its a toss up....later!!"

"event","Wow...I really haven't written in this for a long time...of course maybe that is because my 12 year old brother is always on the computer talking to his potty-mouth girlfriend.  Anwyay, now that he is at school during the day, I have so time to type.  Well, christmas has come and gone.  It was a good one, but different nonetheless.  College makes life a little different, but its ok.  Anyway, I got some good stuff, including a swingline stapler...woohoo!!!!!!!!  Mike actually found a rotary phone!! It is the coolest and I couldn't stop laughing when I opened it.  He also got me a gorgeous ring (I was definitely blushing considering his entire family was there when I opened it) and a monkey wearing boxer shorts....ha.  I got some sweaters and other odds and ends.  The guy sitting behind Alyssa and I at church on christmas eve kept snoring his wife had the most horrible voice ever.  The little kid trying to give stickers to his parents was cute though.  My grandmother cried at christmas dinner because it was her first christmas without my grandfather.  It was sad, but she was alright.  All in all, Christmas 2001 was pretty good.

I am so glad to be home...even though I only have a week and a half before I go back to school. It has been so nice to be with old friends again.  I just found out the other day that I will be living solo when I get back to school because lesley's parents aren't letting her come back to school since she is a waste of their money...and that is putting it nicely.  Anyway, Susie and I are going to see if she can move in with me because that would rock like nobody's business.  

New Year's Eve was pretty lame.  This year we will have to actually plan ahead so that we don't leave disappointed.  it wasn't too bad though...Erin, Kelly, Beth and I had fun with peanut M&M's...alright...so that is pretty lame.  Anyway, the new year is looking promising so everything is alright.

Well, last night's adventures led us to a major sale at Old Navy and a ladies night out at Xando's.  It was a lot of fun.  I got this awesome retro jacket for ten bucks and Mike got a retro zip up shirt...hehe...he looks really cute.  He stopped by to see me today and he was wearing it.  At Xando's, we ran into Sumit and Jordana...it was good to see them again.  Kelly, Beth, and I just talked for awhile...it was a lot of fun...good times, good times.  

Well, who knows what exciting things are going to happen tonight, but now that I have time to use the computer I will try my darndest to keep up my journal.  Later!!"

"event","Life is pretty good right now...excpet for the fac that I am sick.  I don't know what is wrong, my stomach just hurts really bad and I don't feel like eating very much.  I hope I get better soon.  Anyway, since a few people have been wondering what it was that made me so mad last wednesday, I will delight you with the tale.  Alright, so last wednesday, Michell was supposed to go to New York for one of her classes.  The bus was scheduled to leave at 5:30 in the morning so that they could make it in time for their tour of chinatown.  Michell, knowing that she had to get up at quarter to 5 decided not to start doing any of her work until 11:30 and talk on IM instead.  I wasn't feeling the greatest so I went to bed early, but it really wasn't to easy to sleep when someone is typing and opening drawers all the time.  So anyway, I don't know what time she went to bed, but she had assured me that she was going to set out her clothes ahead of time so that she wouldn't wake us up with her drawers in the morning.  So she set her alarm for quarter to 5.  I woke up when her alarm went off and I heard her reach over and turn it off.  On a typical morning, har alarm will go off at quarter after 7 and then she will hit snooze every ten minutes until 7:55 when she will jump out of bed, run around, slam the doors several times, and run off to class that she is already late for.  But on wednesday morning, she turned her alarm off and did not wake up again until 6..in which case she had missed the bus to New York.  She woke Lesley and I up as she jumped out of bed and proceeded to run around slamming the doors.  Then she went over to Colleen, Marissa, and Ashlee's room where she stood banging on the door for about ten minutes.  Since noone got out of bed to get the door at 6 in the morning, she decided she would use the phone in the hall to call them.  So the phone rang in their room for about 5 minutes..all of them wondering who the hell was calling at 6:15 and none of them wanting to get the phone.  So after michell didn't get an answer, she decided to call again.  Finally Marissa picked up the phone and got all bitchy at Marissa who gave the phone to Ashlee.  Now Ashlee is the only one of us who has a car on campus and well...she is an interesting character.  It takes her a long time to wake up.  Colleen and Marisa have told some interesting stories about her being half asleep.  So anyway, Michell started bitching at Ashlee and asking her for a ride to Harrisburg...now keep in mind that it is 6:15 in the morning. Ashlee was apparently falling over while trying to talk on the phone because she was pretty much asleep, but Michell continued to bitch at her.  Ashlee tried to tell her that she couldn't take her to harrisburg because she was tired and asleep and wouldn't be able to find her way back on her own.  Michell continued to bitch and finally Ashlee asked Colleen and Marissa what she should tell her.  Marissa knew that Michell was in the hall so she yelled ""just tell her NO!!!"".  Ashlee got back on the phone and told Michell she couldn't take her and hung up the phone.  So Michell starts flipping out literally running all over our building with her huge-ass, clunky wooden sandals.  She must have come in and out of our room 20 times and most of those times she let the door slam behind her.  Lesley and I were fully awake now and were royally pissed.  The other thing is...we live on the second floor and when the doors slam they are very loud and you can definitely hear them throughout our floor and the first floor...especially when there is no other noise.  Also, Michell was wearing her clunky ass sandals and was running up and down the hall so there is no question that she woke hals=f our dorm up.  Anyway, she then proceeded to call at taxi and bitch about how she needed  a cab to take her to harrisburg immediately.  Lesley and I could hear her and she was being a royal bitch.  After a few more times running up and down the hall and slamming our door, she finally left at about 8:15...that was after I told her to take off her shoes.  We couldn't believe that she would sit and bitch to Ashlee for not taking her when she was the irresponsible one who overslept.  She oversleeps everyday.  You think she would learn by now.  We just couldn't believe it.
     So anyway, we were all kind of wondering how she was plannning on finding her class once she got to New York.  She was planning in taking a bus to New York from Harrisburg and then finding her class there.  Smart.  Well...we didn't find out what really happened until she got home and told Ashlee.  Get this.  Michell payed $230 for a taxi from here to PHILLY!!!!! and then who knows how much she spent on a train ticket from philly to New York.  Then once she was in New York, she bought a subway pass.  Man...she is a genius.  But money is really nothing to her so it doesn't matter how much she spends.  It would have been cheaper for her to take a taxi straight from here to New York, but like I said, money means nothing to her....she spends whatever she wants.  So yeah...then when she got home, she tried to apologize to everyone except Lesley simply because she doesn't like her.  Lesley certainly was not too happy.  Yeah...so that is the stupidity of Michell.  Man...I think I am living with the two dumbest people on campus.  One is failing out of school and doesn't care, while the other is just an idiot.  Aren't I lucky?
    That is all of my story.  I feel like soiled underpants, much like my current away message states.  I just want next week to be over so that I can go home and have some fun.  Once I go home I will only have two more days before winter break!! I can't wait.  The winter ball is going to be fun and Mike is way excited about driving the new car here to pick me up.  It'll be a lot of fun.  I can't wait.  I keep telling myself that it is just one more week.  School is great...but it would be perfect if I lived with other people.  These two drive me absolutely batty.  Alright well...beth just got back from dinner so i am going to talk to her.  Later."

"event","alright...I think I got over my frustration...last week was just a rough week.  Of course, it's almost thanksgiving now and I get to go home in 4 days!!  I was home last weekend for champs.  It was awesome.  It is so weird to watch the competition from the stands after three years of being on the field.  Anyway, Dan, Tony, Jen, Amanda, and I drove to Altantic City together...it was quite an adventure.  We had some good times...especially with dan's radar detector.  Of course, who could forget tony's wonderful singing.  It was just good to spend some time with old friends since college has kind of gotten in the way over the past 3 months.  The competition was awesome and NP walked away with the 5 championship in a row.  Watching Mike up there was the best feeling in the world.  Knowing how hard he has worked and all the crap he gets from people all the time, it was just good to see him succeed...not that he hasn't succeeded in the past.  I know how much this meant to him.  I told him he had nothing to worry about.  Sometimes I worry because I don't think he has enough confidence in himself.  Mike works harder than enyone I have ever met and I was so glad I could be there on saturday to share it with him.  It was just an awesome feeling.  Anyway, Mike and I spent the day together on Sunday and saw Monsters Inc....go see it...it was a fine film.  It was funny cause the whole theater was filled with little kids.  They were cute though.  Of course, eventually I had to go home.  that is always the hardest part.  Before I left, I spent some time at mike's house.  I finally got a chance to look at the picture boards mrs.z made mike for champs.  I have to say that the picture of mike when he was little playing on the snap, crackle, pop drumset was one of my favorites.  Then mrs.z made me eat a piece of pizza before I drove for the 3 hours to get back to school.  I always have so much trouble saying goodbye to him.  I knew it would only be a week before I got to see him again, but it was still hard.  I just love him so much and despite the ""stuff"" that goes on here at school, things are always good when I'm with him. I guess another part of the reason it is so hard to say goodbye is that he is that he always serves as a reminder of the way things were last year...a time when we were seniors and our group of friends was always together.  I haven't seen some of my friends in 3 months.  Mike always reminds me of those times and it makes it even harder to say goodbye.  I am just in love with Mike.  
    Anyway, I can't wait to go home.  Like I said, I haven't seen some of my friends in 3 months...including my best friend Beth.  I miss her so much.  I look at all my pictures I have around my room and think about all the times I would just call her up and we would go do something...even if it was something stupid like search for monster cereals.  I miss that so much.  There have been so many times I have just wanted to dial her number and drive over to her house...but then I realize that I can't because well...she is in Boston and I am here in central PA.  Being away from the people you love just sucks.  I've started a countdown...much like all my other friends...of how long we have until we all get to see eachother again.  After today...it is a mere 4 days!!!!  I can't wait.   It is going to be the best!!
     And there there are unfortunately those rough spots in life, when you want to be with your closest friends, but you just can't be.  I can't say I know exaclty what Kelly was going through this week, but I know I wanted more than anything to be there for her.  You can try as hard as you want to be there for someone with words of support, but its just not the same as actually being there.  I wish I could have been there to give her a hug and sit there and eat a whole carton of ben and jerry's with her.  It hurts when you want to be there for the people you care about but you just can't be.  But we will all be together again in 4 days and although it may hurt at times, things will be ok because we will all be together. Like I said, being away from the people you love just sucks, but you can never tell someone too much that you love them. I can't wait to come home.
    Alright well...I am starving because I didn't eat lunch today.  I opted for the nap instead...I had a big breakfast this morning so its alright.  Anyway, I may not post again before I come home so if not...then I will see everyone at home!!!!"

"event","Things have been a little hectic here and well...Lesley is definitely failing out of school.  She doesn't seem to care either.  Her dad has told her that if she doesn't have a 2.5 by the end of the semester he is taking her out of school.  The way it looks now, she won't be here in the spring.  That is just going to be weird. I mean, Lesley is messy and she drinks a lot, but when she is not drunk she is fun to hang out with and things are just going to be weird without her here.  Of course, nothing we say makes a difference so if she wants to screw herslef over then so be it.  
     I guess I should clarify some of my recent away messages.  Everything is ok.  I just get a little depressed sometimes because I miss everyone so much.  Lately I've just needed someone to talk to and I haven't had that.  Mike calls as much as he can, but he is just so busy that he doesn't have time to sit and talk to me for an hour.  It's not his fault and everything is fine with us.  I've just been particulalry lonely lately.  I've been feeling better though.  I think I just need a break.  My stress level has been extremely high lately.  This weekend I should get a chance to relax a little.  
     I can't wait to go home and see everyone.  I'm going home for champs, but I'm not sure how many other people are going.  It's thanksgiving that is going to rock!  I can't wait.  I just miss everyone a lot.  My new friends here are great, but they just don't measure up to my friends from back home.  I miss you guys.
     So that's about it for now.  I have  a lot of funny stories to write about, but I wnt to make sure I have tons of stuff to talk about when I get home!!  I may write later.  Nothing really exciting is going on right now.  I am very tired.  I think I shall take a nap.  Enjoy your evening everyone."

"event","Okay so here is the deal...in about a half an hour I have to have a ""roommate mediation"" meeting. It is going to be a meeting from hell.  Lesley is just making me sick and angry.  She is generally disgusting, but on top of that it is the mid-point of our first semester at school...what should be the perhaps the easiest semester of our college lives...and she has a GPA of 1.4.  She has tp keep a 2.5 to keep her scholarship.  Not that I should be concernced about how she does in school...because frankly its none of my business if she wants to fail out of school, but she sits and complains about it.  I don't think I have ever seen her crack a textbook...all she does is play computer games....ALL DAY!!!!! She thinks that I am a nerd because I do a lot of work...yeah well...in about a month when she loses her scholarship I'll be laughing really hard.  I have no sympathy for her at all.  She keeps trying to change her major because environmental science ""wasn't working out for her"".  In other words...she wants a major that requires her to do no work...aka a major that is non-existent.  She drinks from thursday night to saturday night and sits on her ass at her disgusting computer desk in between in the middle of all her shit. Yeah...she is a stellar roommate.  I have a feeling that after this year she is going to find herself kicked out of SU...serves her right...she should be.  She has 3 classes and she can't even keep a 2.5...what the hell is going on.  You'd think with all the extra time she has from not doing any work she could keep her 3/4 of the room clean...but no...that's not happening.  I'm just tired of all her shit...literally and figuratively.
     I know that awhile back I was complaining about Michell...but I've learned to deal with her.  Lesley is just plain disrespectful (with her mess and the fact that she takes my stuff without asking).  Michell at least respects me.  I have learned to deal with the way she is and things are ok.  It's kind of hard to get over the disgustingness that is Lesley as soon as you open the door to our room.  This situation has gotten to me so much that I'm making myself sick.  I can't take it anymore, but in about 15 minutes all hell is going to break loose.  I'm extremely nervous about what is going to happen.  I've cried myself to sleep for the past week and I'm just tired of it.  Wish me luck."

Her pile of shit and digustingness just grows everyday.  I don't understand how she can live with herself.  I can't live with her anymore.  It's just too disgusting.  WE put my dresser in the closet so that we could have more room...well...that new space isn't OUR space...it's just more space for lesley to dump her nasty shit.  Michell and I live in 1/4 of the room..which is kept pretty neat and orderly...while Lesley lives in the other 3/4 which is just disgusting.  I used to hate living with Michell...but I've learned how to deal with her.  I can't deal with the nasty smell and the disgust I have each time I step into our room.  It's just nasty. I never thought anyone could be that messy and gross.  Not to mention that she comes in drunk off her ass all the time.  I'm afraid she is going to break something or set the place on fire because of all her shit.  She always leaves her curling iron on...while its sitting on a piece of paper.  Her nastiness is just overwhelming.  You wouldn't believe it until you see it.  I get disgusted everytime I walk in the room.  Not to mention it smells...probably due to the Chai tea (it has milk in it) that has been sitting on her desk for three days.  She is just gross.  I can't take it anymore.  It's nasty...I feel nasty just living here.  I hate this.  I love SU and I like the people here and my classes.  Things in general are going well, its just that she is so damn nasty.  Michell and I are going to get lunch...I'll vent more later."

Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find me, unafraid:

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.

"event","Well...it's another day.  My back hurts...I think I pulled something in kickboxing yesterday.  I can't wait until fall break...I just need a break.  I have had tons of work to do over the past few weeks and I just want to take a break.  Plus I want to spend time with Mike. By the time I go home, it will have been a month since the last time I saw him.  I've never been away from him that long.  Of course...I guess I shouldn't be complaining because by the time I see Beth it will have been 3 months since the last time I saw her.  It's very hard to go that long without seeing my best friend.  I miss Beth a lot.  Of course, we do talk online just about everyday, so that's a plus. The other day we were talking about how we hope people aren't too much different when we come home.  We want things to be the same as they always are.  The scary part is, they probably won't be.  It's college.  I mean, I know that I haven't changed and that I'm still going to be the same around all my old friends, but I'm not sure everyone else will be.  It's a scay concept.  When I was home for Knight of Sound, everything seemed pretty much the same, but we had only been at school for less than a month.  By the time we all see eachother again, we will have been at school for 3 months.  I just hope that things don't change too much. Living here is enough change for me.  I want to be able to go home and have all the old things just as they were when I left.  It's more comforting that way.  Some things are better left the way they are.  I'm looking forward to all of us hanging out just like we used to.  If that ever changed it would be really scary.  Well...I'm sounding really pessimistic so I think I'll stop talking about that now.
     I'm doing really well in school, so that's a bonus.  I got an A on my paper for Moral Conflicts, and 91 on my french test,and a B+ on my American Women Writers paper. Other than that we just have a lot of little papers to write every week that only count as homework.  I got check pluses on those so I'm doing pretty well.  My mom was worried I was going to slack off, but I watched my sister screw up...I learned a lesson from that.  
     Other than that, not much is going on here.  Homecoming is this weekend so there is all kinds of stuff going on.  It'll be fun hopefully...it'll probably be rather crazy also. I'm not stupid though so I'll be fine.  I'm pretty tired...and I'm hungry. I'm going to go see if Colleen wants to go get dinner.  later!"

"event","It's sunday afternoon and I should be working, but once again, I'm procrastinating. All I have to say is that WEEZER ROCKED!!!!  It was an awesome concert. I went with Colleen and 5 of her friends.  We got a late start and her friend Nate was driving the Suburban. Well, since we got a late start, we were driving kind of fast.  Apparently we were driving 89 in a 65...needless to say Nate got a $160 speeding ticket.  We felt bad.  He was so upset because he has never gotten any sort of traffic violation before.  We all gave him some money to cover the ticket though.  Anyway, it was a 4 hour trip to Fairfax, VA.  We had a good time.  We got to the concert right before Weezer came on.  The tickets were general admission so we made our way down to the floor. Of course there were hundreds of people there and Colleen and I couldn't actually see the stage.  Everyone was all sweaty and gross (that's to be expected at a concert, but this was beyond anything I've ever experienced). We were basically being trampled.  Colleen's friend Andy wasn't comfortable staying there so he went up and found a real seat.  Colleen and I stayed on the floor for the first three songs and then joined Andy.  It was good to actually be able to breathe and see the stage.  The show was awesome!!  Weezer definitely puts on a good show.  It was just awesome.  So anyway, after the show we had to wait in the parking lot forever.  Nate had parked the car in a space in front of a grass divider.  By the time we got there, there was already a massive line of cars so we couldn't pull out.  Nate looked in front of him and just plowed the suburban over the divider. It was great.  We were the hit of the parking lot!  Of course we still had to wait though.  For some reason we started talking about squat-thrusts and Lara didn't know what they were so Nate got out,walked about 20 feet in front of the car in the headlight, and did a squat-thrust demonstration.  There was this hippy-guy there with a hackey sack and he was like ""what are you doing?"" and Nate just said ""squat-thrusts"".  It was hysterical.  Then when nate got back in the car, Lara yelled out the window to the hippy guy saying ""do something funny!!""  He yelled back to her ""if you were me, everything would be funny!""  Lara rolled the window back up and turned to us and said ""well, i don't really know what to say to that"".  It was amusing. 
     After that we drove to the hotel and well, there were seven of us but we didn't want to pay for 2 rooms so we were   just going to cheat. Colleen, Nate, Lara, and I went in together.  nate had made online reservations, but when he told the guy his name he told him the it wasn't registered.  So Nate went to the car to get his confirmation paper and when he came back the guy told him it wasn't valid.  The thing is, Nate had used his credit card to pay for it, so if it was a scam, then someone out there has his credit card number.  So now he has to cancel his card.  Then the guy wouldn't give us a room because he said we had to be 21.  After arguing with him for like a half hour, Nate convinced him to let us have the room since he is going to be 21 in April.  Once we got the room, we had to sneak everyone else in thru the fire exit.  It was an adventure.  I slept on a chair. It was a party. In the morning, we just went to the continental breakfast and took all the food.  We were on the road again by 11.  So everything was cool until we missed the Altoona exit and had to go all the way to Jonestown, which is like another 2 hours out of the way.  I was supposed to be back to meet my parents for dinner at 5:45, but we didn't gat back to state college until about 5.  It takes about and hour and a half to get back to SU from state college.  So I called my mom and told her to order a chicken salad for me and that I would meet them around 6:30.  Well, I got there at about 6:40, right before my salad came.  It was perfect.  My parents weren't mad either...another plus.  So everything worked out.  It was a good day.
    Colleen showed me the ""refridgerator graveyard"".  It's pretty much just a MASSIVE pile of old refridgerators and microwaves.  One sort of has to wonder about what that's doing to the environment.... anyway, I did a lot of thinking on the trip.  It was good thinking. 
   Today we had a picnic down by the river. It was a bit chilly, but still fun.  Now I'm here and I really should go do work.  Yeah...I'll check in again later."

My french professor is really weird...I dunno...she is just weird.  Today we were talking about football and she did a demonstration...it was hysterical.  I got an A on my test!  I got a 91! and yes...she actually wrote the exclamation point on the test.  Weird...Anyway,not much else is happening.  I have to go to the computer lab tonight to take this stupid practice test for computer class, but that's all the work I have to do so I suppose I shouldn't be complaining.  Lesley went to go get her tatoo today...she is going to be in pain.  Not to mention her ex-boyfriend/random hook-up kid is coming this weekend.  She admitted to me that they are going to hook up...but I told her that there better not be any BS while I'm in the room. I'm not going to be here on friday night anyway.  The thing is...she is going to be in a lot of pain so it might be hard to ""put out"".  Just as long as I'm not in the room......
Well...Mike told me today that the weekend I have fall break is the weekend of Homecoming so I am going to get to see homecoming!!  That's pretty cool.  I can't wait to go home...only two more weeks.  I guess it kind of seems like I'm not having a good time here, but I really am.  I love it here and I have made a lot of cool friends, but I just miss a lot of things from home.  I guess the only people I'm really going to see when I go home are Mike and Steve.  As far as I know, Steve is the only one who has break then too.  That'll be fun though.  Mike and I are going to spend the whole day together on Sunday and I'm going to see the show at Hofstra on saturday.  That'll be fun too.  The highlight of the weekend though will be getting to spend the day with Mike.  I can't wait for that.  Then when I come back here on the 16, I don't have to get up at 7 for my stupid computer class anymore!!  Woohoo!!I won't have college 101 anymore either!!  My schedule will be so much better...that'll be exciting. 
Nothing else is really going on here.  There is an open-house sort of thing here on monday and I have to talk about the french program here from 12:30-1:30.  Hilf is coming, but I don't really know if I'll have a chance to see him.  I really hope so though.  I haven't talked to him in long time...I miss Hilf.  So yeah...thats about all.
Well...I don't know if I wrote about this before, but living here is kind of like living in a wildlife refuge.  There are animals ALL OVER THE PLACE!!  I mean I knew that beforehand, but they're just all over.  I think our campus contains half the country's population of squirrels, rabbits, and chipmunks.  Plus we have random cats that walk around.  Anyway, the other day I almost stepped on a chipmunk.  It was on the sidewalk and I figured it would move by the time I got to it, but I didn't and I almost stepped on it.  The animals here are very used to people.  It's cool though. Well...I have stuff to do and I have a massive headache, so I'm going to go. bye"

I can't wait to have everyone together again at thanksgiving.  It's going to feel good, just like old times. We'll all be together again.

We decided to rearrange the furniture yesterday and somehow m dresser ended up in the closet.  So now I have no personal space whatsoever.  Lesley and Michell each have a nightstand and a dresser in the room...Michell also has two windowsills.  I get nothing.  I have my desk and my top bunk.  I can't even just sit on my bed because I'm on the top.  I have to climb up there every time.  I have part of a window sill, but I can't see the pictures I have there anyway because I'm on the top bunk.  All the stuff that makes me feel comfortable:the pictures, and other stuff, is now in the closest where I can't even see it and have to struggle to get to it.  I have never felt more alone in my entire life.  I feel like I have nothing. I can't live with Michell anymore.  She is always here and she always has to have evrything her way. If she is cold, she turns the heat on so that our room becomes an oven.  I layed ion my bed last night suffocating because she doesn't want to turn the as on and is too cold. If she wants to watch tv, she turns it on even though Lesley and I are trying to get work done.If she is ready to go to bed, we have to turn every light off so that she can sleep even though we're not ready to go to bed. If I'm on the phone and she wants to use it, I have to get off right away so she can make a call.  Since she still ahsn't realized that there is a reason they told us not to bring IBM Aptiva's to school, I have to listen to her complain about her computer NON-STOP!!  I guess maybe if she had actually paid attention and not been an idiot she would have realized not to bring it.  She is just so damn fake and superficial.  Not to mention she doesn't washe her hair.  Lesley and I can't listen to the music we like, we can't live the way we want to without her all over our cases.  I can't take it anymore.  Now that I don't have anything anymore it makes me feel even more like crap.  I hate living here.  I want to go home.  I want to be able to have some time alone...some space to myself.  I'm never alone anymore, yet I just feel so completely alone. I can't even talk on the phone without someone listening to my conversation.  All my stuff has been shoved in the closet and I have nothing to make me feel at home.  Everyone else does...and the fact that I don't doesn't seem to bother Michell.  All that matters to her is that she has enough space to put on all her damn makeup.  It doesn't seem to matter that I don't even have room to put a picture of my best friends.  I can't stand living like this anymore.  I have nothing and I feel like nothing.  I just want to go home."

I finally got to talk to him and he told me that his eye really hurt for some reason.  I got worried.  But we kept talking and well, he couldn't talk long because he has school tomorrow and a football game and stuff.  So I didn't really get to talk to him at all.  I started crying like I always do.  Then he told me he probably wouldn't be able to talk to me until after KOS on Saturday.  That made me cry even more.  I really hate myself when I get like that.  I act so stupid and selfish.  I hate it.  I really, really hate it.  I don't know what to do though.  I miss him so much and I look forward to talking to him everyday and now that band season has started I definitely won't get to talk to him very much anymore.  Its not his fault, but for some reason I expect him to be superhuman and talk to me anyway.  I hate myself for that.  Its so stupid.  I worry to damn much.  I'm worried that if I don't talk to him he is going to forget about me and not want me around anymore.  I'm afraid that he is going to go to penn state next year and I'm never going to see him again.  I just get so scared; scared about the future.  Mike came into my life at an odd time, but I wouldn't want to change that for the world.  I can't imagine him not being here and I can't imagine not having him around.  I love him and I'm in love with him.  I don't ever want that to change.  I know I have nothing to worry about, yet I worry anyway.  I think there is something wrong with me.  Why do I always act so stupid? I cry every night so much that it hurts.  Sometimes I sit down at my computer typing him and e-mail and I start crying.  And for what?  He is still there when I call him at night...maybe not for long, but he is still there.  I have no reason to be upset, yet I am. Why am I being so selfish? I hate this feeling more than anything in the world. I want it to go away.
 I just want to be with him.  I don't care how long it takes, I just want to be with him.

sorry about all this guys.  It was just on my mind and I had to write it somehwere.  I probably shouldn't have even written it.  I'm a nerd."

they're crowded into the smallest spaces
while outside all of nature cries
it's known to be cruel and unfair
but there is no place to hide
oh I've seen a part of people that I never really want to share
oh I've seen a part of people that I never knew was there

(chorus)
shelter - give them shelter from the coming storm
shelter - give them shelter from the coming storm

I can't sleep haunted by their faces
the sadness in their eyes
it hurts so much to see them helpless
it makes me want to cry
but still there is so much left unanswered
for so many innocent lives
they close the doors and are letting nobody in
and only the strong will survive

I've seen the anger and I've seen all the dreams
and I've watched an existence torn apart by the seams
and though I may seem helpless
I will do all that I can do
oh I've seen a part of people that I never really want to share
oh I've seen a part of people that I never knew was there

chorus

Well, today will be a day that no one will ever forget.  Much like our parents remember where they were when they heard that JFK was assassinated,the people of my generation will remember where they were when the heard that the US was under terrorist attack.  You live your life trying to do good and trying to make things better in the world and then something like this happens and makes you wonder if all your efforts are worthless.  I can't even fathom how people could be so cruel, how they can take human life without a thought...in fact even with a cheer.  What happened today was the most disgusting and disturbing thing I have ever witnessed in my entire life. What is this world coming to? Suddenly killing becomes a way of self-expression and the scariest part of that is that some people in this world are ok with that.  Thousands of innocent people died today...and for what? Well...who knows.  People can search and hypothesize about reasons for this attack, but no matter how many answers they find, there is really never going to be an answer.  There is never an answer for anything like this.  Nothing was gained today, but everything was lost."

I tried to sleep last night, but I just couldn't.  I have a lot of work to do today, but as usual...i'm procrastinating.  I should really get working...alright, I'm making myself feel guilty.  I'm going to go do some work."

"event","Hey everyone.  I'm feeling a lot better today.  I guess drugging myself up and using 3/4 of a bag of cough drops helped.  I'm not 100% yet though.  I was really lonely last night, but then Mike came online and we talked for a long time.  He made me feel better.  We talked about next weekend and the future.  I can't wait until we can just be together.  It's hard to put into words the way I feel about him, but when I think about the future I want it to be with him.  He is the best and I love him so much.  I can't wait to see him on Saturday.  Hopefully this week goes by really fast. Plus I get to see all my other pals on saturday.  I can't wait! 
     Anwyay, this weeekend pretty much stunk.  I was sick so I didn't really do anything. Colleen went to a Jimmy Eat World concert in DC so she wasn't around.  Lesley and Susie went to a party last night.  I could've gone, but I felt like crap.  Plus, I don't really know if I want to get into all that too much.  Lesley said they were only at the party for like 20 minutes and then they just went to go hang out with Nile and his roommate. So I guess it wasn't that good of a party anyway.  I'm very weary of going to parties though.  I don't want to screw up my life.  I don't want to do anything stupid.  I care about my future too much, especially my future with Mike.  I love him too much to do anything that would put me in a bad situation. I'm in love with him and well, that will always be more important than any party.  Colleen and I are in agreement on the whole ""party all weekend"" thing, so we're going to stick together. Colleen is the best friend I have made here and I'm glad she is around.  We like to act stupid and weird together.  But of course she will NEVER replace all the friends I have from home.  They are always going to be the best.  Anway, I should really go and try to get some work done.  I really can't wait until this weeekend!"

"event","Well, here I am, sitting alone on a saturday night feeling like crap.  It sucks when everyone around you is out having fun and you're stuck inside sick with no one to talk to.  I don't even have anyone to call.  I keep hoping maybe the phone will ring and someone will tell me a funny story to help me feel like less of a loser.  But its almost 11:30 and I don't think that's going to happen.  I'm lonely.  Colleen went away for the weekend and everyone else is out. I hate being sick.  I've been getting sick a lot lately and I don't know why.  I know that something is going around campus, but I still feel like crap.  Anway, I guess I'm gonna go to bed."

I'm mad though because I got up early and everything.  What a waste of my energy.  Well, now I'm awake.  I know my entry last night was a little somber, but I was upset last night.

"event","Alright so I've been keeping this journal for a couple months now and I've usually just written about typical things that have gone on in my life.  I'm not the type of person who gets all mushy and writes about Mike all the time. But today was one of the best (and hardest) days of my life..pertaining to Mike that is.  So for the first time, I'm going to get mushy.  Mike came up to visit me today and while he was here I came to one conclusion, I'm in love with him.  I know that I'm only 18 and well...that's kind of young to be saying that I'm in love, but I can't find any other way to describe it.  He got here today and we walked around campus for a little bit.  Then we went out to lunch at this restaurant called BJ's. It was fun.  After that we came back to my room and just layed around watching TV and talking...and no..there was no ""pitching woo""...my roommtes were there.  Then we decided to go take a walk down to the river.  It was an absolutely beautiful day and the river was gorgeous.  There are benches all along it so we picked one in the shade and sat down.  I think that will be one of the best memories of my entire life.  It was more than perfect.  We just sat and talked.  It was beautiful.  Then we walked back and went to dinner at the encore.  Then we came back and just chilled.  I cried...yeah I'm not going to hide it.  I've never felt this way about anyone before.  He makes me so happy.  We've been through the bad times and everything always turns out ok.  I think there is something to be said about that.  I didn't want to let him go.  I cried a lot.  I can't imagine him not being a part of my life and I don't want to not be a part of his. We've been dating for just about a year. Even though things haven't always been perfect, we've made it through and we've learned a lot. He is the best.  It was so hard to say goodbye tonight.  I didn't want him to leave.Yeah...I'm in love with Michael."

"event","Woo...well..here I am again.  I'll tell you...this is one crazy place!!  Not really...well...school is awesome, but Selinsgrove isn't exactly the ""hot spot"" of PA.  Anyway, Yesterday Lesley, Michell, Colleen, Suzy, and I went to Value City and Wal-Mart.  It was totally hot.  We had to take public transportation...it was an adventure.  The bus drivers are all kind of sketchy and well, we got a schedule, but that didn't seem to matter because the buses are never on time.  You pretty much just have to guess.  Not to mention that the drivers can't really drive.  It was kind of scary.  But hey, we got great deals at Value City and on food stuffs at Wal-Mart.  It was a good time.  We had a lot of fun, except when we had to drag our bags back home from the bus stop.By the time we got back, we had missed dinner at the cafe and so we went to the encore to get some food.  Some kid dropped his soda on the floor and Colleen burst out laughing and said ""that really sucks"".  It was pretty loud...something reminiscent of Beth, but not quite so bad!!(I love you Beth!!)  Then she felt bad and offered to go help him clean it up, but he said one of the ladies working there was going to do it.  Needless to say, we had a good time at dinner.  After that, we went to Colleen's and put highlights in her hair and in Lesley's hair.  I wasn't there the whole time because I had tons of work to do before Mike comes!!!  I stopped by to take funny pictures though.  It was a good time.  We didn't go to bed until almost 2 am, but it's ok..we had a good time.  
So anyway...Mike is coming today!!!!!  He should actually be here really soon, but he is going to call me when he gets closer.  He doesn't really know where I live.  I tried to explain it to him, but he wasn't really listening.  Anyway, Colleen is having one of her guy friends up today too and she asked if we wanted to go see a movie with them.  That would be cool, but I guess I'll have to see what Mike wants to do.  Alrighty well...I'm going to go because I have to finish getting ready!!!"

"event","Well, since lj is actually working today I can actully post an entry.  So far I'm enjoying college life.  My roommates are the coolest.  We get along really well and I consider myself lucky because I can picture us all being friends throughout the next four years.  Two other girls I've gotten to know are Suzy and Colleen.  They are both really cool.  Suzy has to live with the whore and the nerd though and Colleen has to live with Barbie.  They often find themselves in our room.  Things are going well here.  I'll just enlighten all of you with one story:
So the other day Lesley and I wanted to go swimming.  Lesley has contacts and can't see without them so she needed goggles (she left hers at home).  Suzy asked Janice (computer nerd)if she had any that Lesley could borrow.  She said yes and Suzy brought them over later.  At first glance they were normal black goggles, but we soon discovered otherwise.  Each lens had a hologram shark in it.  Lesley put them on and walked around the room with the sharks highly visible.  They were hysterical.  We couldn't stop laughing.  In any event, we decided not to go swimming because we would like to have friends.  We got a good laugh out of them though.
My classes are alright I guess.  I should be doing work right now, but I wanted to post an entry.  Like I said, I'm having a really good time here, but I'm definitely missing everyone back home.  It scary to pack up your life and move it somewhere else where you don't know anyone.  You have to start making friends all over again and it's not always easy.  It's good to know that you always have your old friends to count on.  I miss them all so much!!  I'll be seeing Jen, Amanda,Tim, and Hilf soon though! Hopefully Beth too!!  It's definitely weird not having them around all the time.  At times, you can't help but get depressed.  But then you realize that they're always going to be there and everything is okay.  Then there is Mike.  I talk to him every night on the computer at least, but I still miss him so much.  I miss having him around all the time.  He always made everything okay no matter how scared or stressed I was.  I didn't think it was going to be quite so hard to leave him.  Sometimes when we're talking and he gets upset, I just want to give him a hug and tell him that everything is going to be ok.  I know it is and I hope that he knows that.  He is coming to see me on Sunday and I can't wait. I love Mike.  
Anyway, to Beth, Hilf,and Kelly who are like the only ones who read these...I miss you guys!!  I feel like something is missing.  I can't wait to see all of you again!!  Feel free to visit me anytime!!  Well, I really have to go read.  I'm procrastinating already."

We get along really well, even though we don't have much space.  Lesley is going to try to start a swing dance club and Michell and I are going to be her first members.  Umm...okay one of the toilets just overflowed and there is water all over the floor on the hallway. It's not gross water, just water. Yesterday some girl left a lamp too close to a pad of paper and started a small fire.  It wasn't serious, but I had my robe on and my roommate was in the shower when the alarm went off.  It wasn't fun.Tomorrow there is going to be another natural disaster.  But really...our dorm is one of the nicest ones on campus...we're just having trouble right now.  Anyway, I have soe stuff to do.  I'll probably write more later.  I miss all of you guys very much.  Feel free to visit me anytime!!"

"event","Well...my time here is done for a little while.  Tonight I said ""see you later"" to my the best friends anyone could ask for...well...Kelly, Steve,Jen, and Erin were yesterday.  Beth and I went to band practice so I could give Tobias his baseball gloves back and I had a gift to give the Z's.  Of course that was only a tiny portion of the reason I wanted to go.  I wanted to say goodbye.  Mrs.Z opened the gift and well...I almost lost it.  She is the sweetest, coolest woman in the world and throughout this year she has always been there when I needed to talk.  And then there is Mr.Z. who's hair is awlays messed up and he can't go a minute without cracking a joke.  I found that that trait got passed down :)  Anway, Mrs.Z and I shared hugs and she let me know that she is always there if I need anything.  Then she made sure that I promised to study hard and eat while I'm away.  I also promised her that I would get vitamins with iron.  I'm going to miss that family very much, but I know everytime I call I'm gonna talk to more than just Mike.  After that I said goodbye Rich...definitely a funny guy...Ken and Elyse.  Then it came time for Hilf.  That was a really hard one.  I'm going to miss him so much.  Who is going to tease me about stupid stuff all the time?  Hilf is the best...he better come visit me ;)  Then came Beth...words can't even describe what it is like to say goodbye to your best friend.  I started bawling.  I'm going to miss her more than words can ever say, but I know our friendship is going to last a lifetime.  It was hard.
Finally Mike and I went out for ice cream at Friendly's.  We played more sugar packet football, but we had to change the rules after I flicked the packet over the table and against the wall.  He won this time, but not by much.  He drove me home and we sat in my driveway talking and laughing about all sorts of stuff.  It was exactly the way I wanted to leave him.  I started crying when I actually had to sat goodbye. It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.  I love Michael so much.  He will always be in my heart.  
Then I went inside and just sat and cried for about a half hour.  Then I read the book Beth wrote for me.  I found myself laughing and crying at the same time.  I'm probably going to read it everyday.  Friends are the best.
So...this is my last entry...hopefully not for too long.  Thankyou to all from the bottom of my heart.  You'll always be on my mind.  I'm out."

"event","For some reason I am wide awake right now.  I spent most of my day packing.  I went out with my mom to get a few final items.  Then I came home and packed some more.  Tonight Kelly, Beth, and I tried to go to the ""grandslam"" theater again.  Yeah..it's closed.  Then we went to wal-mart to get some more college stuff.  I got a really cute poster.  Kelly tried to get the same one, but she accidently picked up a different one.  It has a half-naked cowboy on it.  That sucks, but it's still kind of funny.  Anyway, then we went to Beth's house to make ""poo cookies"".  I managed to melt Beth's tupperware.  I feel really bad.  I'm not really much of a chef.  We had fun though.
Tomorrow afternoon is the last time I'm going to get to hang out with Kelly for awhile.  That stinks, but I know I'll be talking to her online.  My mom bought me a microphone for my computer because she figured I'd be calling people a lot...especially Mike.  That way I can save on phone bills.  My room is becoming very empty...it's kind of scary.  I packed up all my pictures today.  I'm going to need those a lot.  I can't believe I'm leaving in 2 days.  It's the start of an adventure."

"event","I haven't written in awhile, but I've pretty much been hanging out with Beth.  We've definitely had some good times, but she just finished writing about them so I won't bore all of you with the same stories.  Even though Beth putting her hand through a glass cabinet is still funny no matter how many times I tell it :) Anyway, Let's see...On Saturday I went to Plymouth Meeting with Beth and that night Mike and I rented a movie...go figure.  We were going to go out to the theater, but by the time he got out of work it was already late and there was nothing playing that we wanted to see.  It was fun anyway.  My dad told me not to stay out late, but I didn't come in until 2:00...although he didn't know that until my mom said something on Sunday morning.  At this point I don't care what my dad has to say.  I only have 3 days left and Mike is pretty busy so I want to see him as much as I can.  Then yesterday I spent the day packing and talking to Jon and Oscar online.  It's weird that they are actually at school right now like 9 hours away.  We definitely had fun though...computers are the best!  Then I went to the mall with my brother.  He had to get a birthday gift for his girlfriend.  A little while after we came home, my sister came in.  She decided to come for dinner last night.  As usual, she was acting like a bitch.  About 5 minutes after she came in my brother turned to me and asked when she was going to leave.  She likes to make rude comments about the fact that my brother and I have relationships.  My brother and his girlfriend are celebrating their 2 year anniversary on sept. 1 and when my brother told her that she said ""That means you guys started dating like 2 weeks after school started. That's really sick"". My brother then called her a  bitch and refused to tell her what he got Audrey (his girlfriend).  Alyssa makes comments like that a lot.  She likes Audrey and she likes Mike, but she tends to make rude comments about our relationships.  My brother and I have pretty much concluded that she is jealous because we've had longer, more meaningful relationships than she has ever had and we're younger than her.  When it comes to relationships, my sister is pretty much just a bitch.
Anyway, Mike and I went out to dinner at like 8:30 last night.  We played sugar packet football while waiting for our food...how mature.  It was fun though I must say...especially since I beat Mike by over 15 points.  There were times when we lost control of the football too....funny stuff.  We had a good time at dinner and then we decided we would hop over to the theater to see if anything good was playing.  Well, it wasn't so we went back to Mike's house.  His parents were watching ""Gladiator"" (not the one with cuba gooding jr.)  It was almost over though and they had rented two other movies...well actually mrs.z rented 2 other movies (yeah chic flicks!!)  Mike's parents are hysterical.  I'm going to miss them.  At one point his dad asked me to tell them what I was going to do to sarah.  At first I didn't know what he was talking about, but then I realized he was talking about how I told Mike that if sarah l. was hanging all over him all the time I was going to punch her in the face.  I denied it when his dad asked, but then I started laughing and his dad was like ""well..that's not what Mikey said...""  Then I sort of admitted that I told Mike I was going to punch her in the face.  His parents got a good laugh.  I really am going to miss them.  They've always been so good to me.  Who else is going to call me ""miss emmy""?  Anyway...after gladiator was over his parents went upstairs and Mike and I watched ""chocolat"".  Mike was VERY reluctant to watch it to say the least.  It was a very good movie.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Even Mike admitted that it was pretty good.  By the time I got home it was a little after 2.  All the lights were off in my house and everyone was in bed.  Before I went inside though, Mike and I sat in his car talking about saying goodbye.  He said that one of the people at work told him that it would be easier if we didn't say goodbye, but we just said ""see you later"".  That sounds really good to me.  Mike and I have already spent time crying over saying goodbye.  I've come to realize that I shouldn't be calling it a goodbye either because it's not.  See you later is much more appropriate because well...I know I'll be seeing him later.  For the first time Mike and I talked about me leaving without getting upset.  Then he started being really weird because he was so tired.  I haven't seen him like that for awhile...it was very amusing.  It was definitely a good night.
Well...like I said, I only have 3 days left here.  As with Mike, I'm going to stop using the word goodbye with friends too.  I know I'll be seeing all of them later so that's what I'm going to say.  Anyway, I think beth and I are going to get together to make ""poo cookies"" tonight since we're going to serve lunch tomorrow...woohoo!! It's going to be weird serving lunch instead of eating it.  Beth and I making cookies will definitely be crazy!  I just realized something though...we don't have the recipe...hmm.....we may have to call mrs.uehling.  Other than that I'm going out with my mom to do my final shopping and I'm working on packing my stuff.  I've realized that I have so much to do and so little time."

"event","Hmm...I don't really have that much to write about.  Well, today Beth and I went to breakfast with Mrs. Simeon.  We had a lot of fun talking about Disney and English class. Mrs. Simeon was definitely one of the best teachers I've ever had.  After that, Beth and I went to the mall.  She finally got her shoes and I got this really awesome Rainbow Brite shirt.  It's really funky...a throwback to our childhood :)  Anyway, then i came home and just kind of chilled out.  I talked to Mike, but that was about it.  Tonight we're going to see the mk performance and probably to get ice cream or something.  It'll be a good time.
    Last night I went with people from church to play bingo at a home with elderly people.  It was a lot of fun.  I got to pick and read the numbers.  At the beginning I was reading them really slow because I figured I should.  Then one of the residents told me that I was reading to slow and that they were going to be there all day.  Later two ladies and a man accused me of telling them to clear their cards.  I tried to explain nicely that I never said that, but they strted yelling, insisting that I announced to everyone to clear their cards.  I couldn't help laughing...it was amusing.  Overall it was a good time.  Hilf and I got ice cream afterwards.  It was fun.  We also spent time trying to convince Mrs.Z and Mrs. Hilferty that Mike and Hilf coming up to Penn State and stopping to visit me was a really good idea.  They're not quite all for it yet, but they're getting there.
    I'm really mad right now.  I got this letter in the mail from SU yesterday telling me about a retreat that the honors program students go on.  Guess what weekend its on...sept 14-15...go figure.  That's the weekend of the KOS and I was going to come home because I really, really want to be here to see it.  Not to mention that Mike and I will be celebrating our one year anniversary on the 16. I want to be here more than anything.  It's really important to me.  I'm hoping that maybe the retreat isn't mandatory.  If it is, hopefully we will get back fairly early on the 15 and I can still come home to catch the show.  If not I'm seriously going to cry.  That is the one weekend that I want to be here.  If there was only one weekend that I could come home, that would be it.  I'm very upset and worried right now.  I told Mike that no matter what I would be here and now I'm not so sure I will be.  Why do things like this always happen to me?  I want to be home that weekend more than anything. I guess all I can do right now is wait and see.  I would give anything to just be here that one weekend."

"event","There's some friction lately in our household. See, Steve does not like Obama, not one bit, and I'm excessively pleased to have him as ou new president. It's really bringing to the front the schism between our political views. And I do not have the vocabulary to deal with it. 

You've probably heard of Obama's lift of the <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7847651.stm"">""ban on abortion funds."" </a> I was elated to hear about this. It was a stupid, stupid ban. Alright, so it isn't the Top Priority among the huge mess we're facing here in the US. Still, it's something small and immediately accomplishable. Pleasing to see Obama taking such a decisive step in his very first days in office. 

Steve's response? ""Great, just what we need to be doing. Sending more money out of the country."" Oh, so freaking negative. And this is different from the money we're funneling into an endless war, murdering and destroying? How? How is it different? And don't give me any of that bullshit about ""safeguarding the freedom and security of our nation."" 

But of course that's exactly the kind of crap he would start spouting.

"event","On a new medicine. I don't know if it's the medicine or not, but I've got my old motivation back. 

Yesterday I sewed nearly my entire skirt for the wicked faire, did all of my homework for the next three days, shot through some laundry, made play dough for Nate (awesome stuff, homemade play dough) and... well, I managed a whole bunch of little domestic things, too. I haven't felt this productive and driven since college. 

Is it the medicine? Or did something just click into place? Or maybe it's two days of bed rest from a nasty cold. I <i>was</i> home sick Wednesday and Thursday. Wicked cold. I still have it. 

Anyway, I'm babbling; the REAL reason I'm writing is to let you know I have several more videos of Nate up on YouTube. Including some charming gems I discovered on our old hard drive.

"event","This is the subtle sort of danger posed by stupid people. 

You probably know about the <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7614083.stm"">Chinese infant formula scare</a>. Or maybe you don't. Very recently, reports hit that a brand of Chinese baby formula was severely contaminated with melamine, a toxic substance. It's been causing kidney stone in infants, and at least one baby has already died from drinking the stuff.

Well here's a bit of Golden Stupid from my co-worker. I'll paraphrase, but it's pretty close:

""You know how there's that bad baby food that China's been making? Well, what about this. What if, just bear with me for a minute, what if they'r trying to <i>kill American babies.</i> 
""Think about it! Seriously, what if this is some terrorist plot--I'm not saying that all Chinese are terrorists, but... but, think about it! Killing American babies with this bad formula! They're sending it over here to, like, <i>kill</i> us! It could be true! Just, what <i>if</i>?""

Right. Now this went on for a bit, and I didn't know whether to laugh at her, yell at her, or just cry from the st00pid. 

First off, the infant formula wasn't exported, except a small amount that made it to Taiwan. Second, all of the affected babies have been--big shock here, considering it's a domestic product--<i>Chinese</i> babies. 

I didn't know these details at the time, so let me point out some other points of Dumbness. 

One, basic practicality: destroying the United States by poisoning it's babies? Um, highly impractical from so many angles. Too long term, too exclusive, and what about all those babies being raised on breast milk and formula produced domestically and/or in countries that are not China? It isn't like China's the only country that produces baby stuff. I think, from the way she was talking, that maybe my co-worker momentarily forgot that.

Two: consider the amount of subtlety and control necessary to orchestrate a plot of this scope. The food--and, as she pointed out, the toys and other baby products--exported to America, and only to America, are poisoned, while all other export products are pristine. Does China, of all places, have that kind of quality control? This country's manufacturing regulations and controls are <i>known</i> to be shite. They don't  have the infrastructure in place to ensure quality production, and that's an old, well-known problem. Most likely, someone made a grave mistake, or was trying to cut corners, and it went badly. Human incompetence is <i>almost always</i> the more likely answer. 

I could go on, but why beat a dead horse? Besides, Nate's growing restless. 

Look, prejudice comes in many forms. This girl isn't ""racist,"" certainly. <i>If they're American.</i> But she says things, sometimes, about other countries, people who don't speak English, and immigrants, that make me cringe. Xenophobia--fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign--is a form of prejudice too. 

Sorry, but when something like <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7614083.stm"">this</a> triggers a nonsensical rant about The Big Bad Chinaman Killing American Babies, that's xenophobia. 

It also happens to be a prejudice that we seem to <i>encourage</i> in this country. Something bad happen? Irrationally blame another country for terrorism! And we have cause, too: Remember What Happened ONCE Seven Years Ago And Has Not Been Repeated Since!!!! It's like 9/11 is the perfect excuse for xenophobia. (Yes, she made the 9/11 *wink, nod* connection, too, even though I still can't figure out what China had to do with the Twin Towers.)

And it's st00pid, too."

I'm still not on medication. We just do not have the money. I got to the psychiatrist's Tuesday, but only because mom gave me a blank check to pay the doctor.

<lj-cut>
Yesterday I get pulled over, three blocks from my house, on the way to work. Complete confusion. <i>Why</i> in the  world am I getting pulled over? I was going the speed limit, I didn't break any laws, I didn't do anything wrong. 

The police officer tells me that my registration expired two months ago, and my inspection expired last month. Well, that came as a surprise. See, this is what happens when your parents try to ""shelter"" you from the world and don't let you have a car in your name until you're twenty-eight! Yes, it's <i>nice</i> of them, always buying cars for me and taking care of all that stuff for me--even though, mind you, I never asked them to, in point of fact have asked them <i>not</i> to, maybe that makes me ungrateful, wanting  to do for myself instead of always having mommy & daddy step in and swoop it out of my hands, but then you get to be twenty-eight and you don't know little things like ""the vehicle's registration needs to be periodically renewed"" and, I don't know, <i>when</i> and <i>how</i> to do things like that. Twenty-eight and I need  a cop to tell me that I have to register my vehicle! Damn it! 

Now that's something a lot of people are going to think is just stupidity on my part. And maybe it is. But it's the same idea I try to dig in to my coworker's heads about the kids: if you don't teach them, they don't know. True, I'm not a three-year-old, but neither was I born with the entirety of the Pennsylvania Vehicle and Driving Laws plugged into my brain. Do I feel stupid? Yes, I do. And poor. I feel very, very poor. Because between the ticket and the registration fees and the cost of inspection, I'm going to be broke for a good long time. So, I feel poor, and stupid. But it would have never occurred to me to look at that registration sticker, or to ask about whether or not it had to be renewed; so help me, I thought it was something the state did automatically for you; I didn't <i>know</i>. Maybe that makes me dumb. It certainly makes me annoyed. 

The inspection, that was just me not paying attention. I simply didn't realize that it had expired. My bad. 

While we were on the subject of Things That I Was Doing Wrong, I told the officer that there was a problem with my license and would he <i>please</i> tell me what the problem was. He started to get an attitude with me--probably thought I was trying to BS my way out of yet another ticket. Once I explained the situation to him--the short version--he agreed to check and get back to me. Some of you may not know that there's a situation with my license, so allow me to explain. 

The License: We moved back to PA nearly 2 years ago. I went to the DPW to get my NJ license transfered to a PA license shortly after we moved. PA tells me that there's a ""problem"" with  the license, and they can't do anything for me. They can't tell me what the problem is, and direct me to New Jersey's DOT. 

Two years later, I still can't get a hold of a real person on the NJ end of things. I've tried internet, phone, fax, and snail-mail. I would gladly show up in person, if I had the time to jaunt over the border and spend a whole day--or two, or three, or however many it would take to move up the rungs of incompetence and find someone who could help me--sitting around in various NJDOT offices digging up the problem. But I confess it's a Low Priority for me. I've got a job, a home, and a son, and those three things keep me plenty busy. NJDOT just doesn't even make the Priority List, beyond what phone calls &etc I can squeeze in here and there.

So, no PA license, and the problem with my NJ license remains unresolved. 

I explain all of this to the officer, and ask him to <i>please</i>, for pity's sake, get me some information to work with, even if it means another ticket, because I'm at a loss and I just do not know what to do.

The officer comes back from doing whatever it is they do in their cars when they've pulled you over, and he tells me that, according to New Jersey, <i>I HAVE NO LICENSE.</i> Now, the damned thing is <i>in</i> the officer's hand, with another two years before it expires, and NJ is saying that it simply doesn't exist. 

Well, what am I supposed to do now? That's what I ask the officer. He tells me that I'm going to have to go through the whole process again in PA: learner's permit, written test, all of that. I'm actually relieved. At last, an answer. I was thinking that I'd get in some kind of trouble going through all of that nonsense for a brand-new license when I already had one issued to me--like some kind of fraud attempt or something, you know, claiming I didn't have a license when I clearly did, trying to fake out the system or whatever other nonsense, because really the State makes no sense to me and I honestly thought there was a rule somewhere about that sort of duplicity. ""Trying to get a second license, when you already hold one, eh? We don't go easy on your sort, you know..."" 

But if the NJ license--against all evidence to the senses--just doesn't exist, then that does simplify things, doesn't it? 

The only problem is that I have no car and no license and no money, so I'm now completely dependent on Steve. 
The whole thing has me very nearly non-functional, overwhelmed, ill, and despairing. It doesn't help that I'm off my meds--a debacle that  I just don't feel like getting into right now--and the chemical crash certainly isn't helping my situation. I was out sick yesterday and today is a legitimate day off. Writing this is my Attempt at Mental and Emotional Catharsis for the day. I just can't bring myself to <i>do</i> anything else.

Steve doesn't seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situation. He's been having mini-hissy-fits about taking Nate to school. Today he gave me his paycheck and told me to cash it. 
""HOW?"" I asked. 
""Go to the bank and cash it,"" he told me. 
""In what car? With what license?"" 
""You have a car. You'll have to risk it."" 
I was dumb-struck for a moment or two. ""Can't you go on your lunch break?"" I finally managed.
""No,"" he said, as if it was the dumbest question he'd ever heard. ""I don't have time.""
This went on for a while. It got quite ridiculous. 
Finally, I snapped, ""do you realize that I could get thrown in jail for driving that car? Unregistered? With no license? Jail, Steve, <i>jail</i>! Take it on your <i>lunch break</i>!"" I then locked myself in the bathroom for a good five minutes, and when I came out, I went straight to bed. 

I still don't think he <i>got</i> the <i>point</i>. 

So now I have to convince him to take me to the DMV tomorrow, even though we have visitors coming, and yes, it really sucks, but I'm going to have to miss hanging out with his aunt & uncle so I can get this pesky license & registration thing taken care of, but I'm sure they will understand that I'm not <i>avoiding</i> them and given the choice I really would not <i>like</i> to be spending my whole Saturday at the DMV. And then I have to convince him to take me <i>back</i> to get my driver's license, and that's provided that I manage to  get the permit and registration tomorrow, which may not happen if they're too busy. And I'm sure he's going to have a fit when he has to drive me around all week, until I have my car inspected and my license in hand, but that's really too bad, because I'm not going to <i>jail</i> just to make his week a little <i>easier</i>.

This whole thing has me really, really stressed out."

<i>""I can tell you right now why John McCain has twelve fucking pets, despite spending all his time on the road and campaigning and being an awful senator and trying to come up with something so ridiculous that the press won't call him on it*. You want to know why? Because his wife's a bajillionaire and they have SIX FUCKING HOUSES, that's why. When you have six fucking houses, you need a lot more pets to make sure there are pets in each one.

""It's funny how that part never gets mentioned in fellatious press pieces like this. John McCain loves animals so much he has twelve of them! He's such a regular guy! He must REALLY love houses, then. I bet that makes him even more like the rest of us. Hey, with the foreclosure crisis, maybe Cindy can pick up a few more houses for them on the cheap. Then they can get a few more cats, a komodo dragon, and an ocelot. And we can identify with them even more.""</i>   --from http://www.youaredumb.net/node/1111

In other news:

PA has a professional web site for Child Care Professionals (aka Underpaid Diaper-Changers): www.pakeys.org

I've been on it quite a bit lately, trying to figure out how to get me some free continuing education. Wouldn't you know? PSU has come to the rescue. They have a program called ""Better Kid Care"" that offers supplemental instruction units as web-based training. I've signed up for three of them: ""Biting and Sharing"", ""Supporting Stressed Children"" and ""Violence, Kids, Discipline, and Keeping the Peace"".

They became active yesterday, and the site is down for maintenance today. Bummer. But I did download the training manuals as PDF files, so I've been reading through  them. They're a hefty ten pages each (ooooh, aaaah) and offer such world-shattering information as ""children bite when they are angry"" and ""stressed children may have tantrums.""

I paid $5.00 a piece for these lessons. I'm wondering if I've overpaid. :-P

Maybe the instructional videos will be better. Have to wait until the site comes back online before I can find out, though. In the mean time, I'm left trying to rummage whatever useful advice I can from the training manuals. 

And I got up at 5:30 in the morning to do it. YEY."

"event","<b>What I Do All Day
or,
My Job</b>


I am an ""Assistant Teacher"" with a chain daycare company. I ""teach"" the 2-year old class. The class consists of 5-13 children between the ages of 22 months and 2.5 years old; some children come five days a week, while some come three or two, so the number of children depends on the day of the week.

<b>Some Basic Facts About 2-Year-Olds
or 
Things You Need To Know</b>

Children this age generally aren't toilet trained. So, I change diapers. We change diapers every 2 hours or more. The head teacher and I swap diaper-changing duties, so we each change a minimum of 10 dirty diapers a day. I almost never have a day where I change the minimum, and that 10-diaper mark gets passed well before 11 o'clock in the morning. 

Children this age have greatly varying abilities of speech. Some of them have mastered 3 and 4 word sentences. Most of them are still working on single words. We're still working on using forks and spoons; most of the children can't drink out of a regular cup; many of the children still need bibs. Psychologically, they won't be able to grasp the idea of ""sharing"" for another year or two, so we try to teach them to ""take turns"" and ""ask nicely."" They have very short memories, so they need constant reminders of simple things: ""keep your feet on the floor,"" ""walk, please,"" ""gentle touch,"" ""we eat food; crayons/dirt/bugs are not food."" 

Children this age, for the most part, simply do not understand negatives. This is probably the most difficult part about working with them. Saying ""don't run"" means nothing to them; what are they supposed to do, if they aren't running? An adult can make the leap of logic: don't <i>run</i> = <i>do</i> walk. Most two-year olds can't make that jump. To them, don't run = ""?"" They just don't know what to do. So you have to say everything in positive terms. ""Don't run"" becomes ""use walking feet, please."" Instead of telling them what they should <i>not</i> do, you remind them of what they <i>should</i> be doing. ""Don't eat crayons"" becomes ""eat <i>food</i>, <i>color</i> with crayons,"" a reminder of what one <i>should</i> do with crayons, and of what one <i>may</i> put in one's mouth. ""Don't hit"" becomes ""use gentle hands,"" and ""don't climb"" becomes ""feet on the floor,"" and so on. It's all so very <i>not how we're used to speaking.</i> 

I've gotten pretty good at it. My co-worker, the head teacher, isn't so good at it. She keeps saying ""no"" and ""don't"" and getting frustrated when they don't understand. Rather, when they don't obey her. Well, duh, most of them <i>can't</i> understand and obey yet, and it's not their fault. Tell them what they should be doing, and they'll usually do it! And be prepared to tell them <i>often</i>, because their memories aren't so good yet. And stop taking their childishness so personally; it's not like they're being purposefully disobedient! (Trust me. When they are being purposefully disobedient, you can tell. Toddlers have zero subtlety.) Frankly, I had expected better from a psychology major. (-.-)

<b>How I Justify My Title
or
How Do You Teach Toddlers?</b>

Anyway, all of this merits putting the word ""teacher"" in quotations; we do far more damage control than actual teaching.

We do have a curriculum, lesson plans, mapped out schedules, the whole nine yards, just like a Real School. You might think this is silly, giving two-year-olds a curriculum. Let me tell you, it's brilliant. Really, what do you do to occupy rambunctious toddlers all day? A curriculum and a schedule help answer that question. Without order and routine--not too much, mind you, but just enough--toddlers go a little bit crazy. No, scratch that. They bounce off the walls. They're out of control. You know that old bromide, ""kids crave discipline""? It's true, I swear it. I'm not talking about a militaristic regiment, just a fairly ordered and predictable day. It turns a wild mob of savage, vicious little heathens into a semi-manageable mob of adorable, precocious little heathens.  

The nice thing about the daycare chain I work for is that they've already got a comprehensive curriculum and teaching materials already set up for you. Every season, each class gets a box of curriculum materials and a bin of special toys. We have books that walk us through all of the lessons. Everything is there for you, you just have to read it and implement it. And with the basic lesson already handed to you, coming up with daily supplemental activities (art projects, song and story times, outdoor play) becomes a pleasant creative exercise instead of a burdensome chore.

While it's not rocket science, we are teaching them important lessons. These little things we're coaching them through are the foundations for the rest of their lives. Can you imagine the time a child would have if they went to kindergarten ignorant of the most basic classroom rules? 

We teach them that lunch will be served at lunch time, that we sit and listen in circle, that we play nicely during play time. We teach them to walk inside, to use quiet voices, to ask permission and wait their turn. All of this stuff actually has to be learned. 

Their parents can't do it; they're at the office all day, they see their children for an hour in the morning and an hour or two at night. When can we expect them to make time to teach these things to their kids? During those precious two or three hours? Can we begrudge them a bit of coddling and spoiling in those few moments they get to see their children? No, I don't think we reasonably can. 

We are the ones who see their children for six to eight hours every day; we are the ones with the luxury of time. The lessons might be small and simple, but we are the ones who have to teach them.

Still, it's a hard job. The kids are very difficult to handle at this age. It's termed the ""terrible twos"" for an excellent reason."

In other news, went to a wedding this weekend. Still hate weddings, but I have to say that this one was IMPRESSIVELY orchestrated; very lovely indeed. It was a nice weekend retreat in Fredrick, MD; good food, good company, and a bed that I didn't have to make. 

Congratulations Dean & Mandy! <3


Steve starts his new job tomorrow. I have a new job possibility on the horizon. More about my current job is being written, but it may take a few more days for me to finish putting together anything particularly readable."

"event","I am thinking that it's time I started taking my craftiness seriously. So, I'm going to invest in some good water-based theatrical paints and start face painting at fairs and cons. Several things have inspired this decision; first, I've been told  that I'm pretty good at it; second, I've been told that you can make good money doing it; third, I saw what they were doing at Disney and it inspired me to a whole new level of artistry. Mostly though I'm sick of being bored, unemployed, and missing out on all the cons and fairs. 

Two question:

<ul>
<li> Would anyone like to pose for me? This will require <ol>
<li>Coming to visit</li>
<li>Sitting for long periods of time while I mess about with your face;</li>
<li>Consenting to have a photo taken of your finished face;</li>
<li>Consent to having this photo displayed at various cons and fairs;</li>
<li>MAY require you to put up with, possibly hold for a short period of time, my 13 month old son.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>Know any fairs or cons at which my talents might be appreciated? I know that I could have made a bundle at Wicked Faire, and that most Ren Faires already have face painters, but I'm definitely in need of suggestions.</li></ul>

Eagerly awaiting responses."

"event","Some of you may have noticed the CRAZY electric bill I mentioned yesterday.

For those of you who didn't, let me reiterate:




This month = $40.00

Usually = $200.00 +

This is a HUGE savings. What did I do differently? Not all that much.

First, understand this: our heat and stove are electric. 
I'm home all day, so I cook three meals and make tea two or three times, so the stove is in frequent use, and that's not going to change. The heat also stays consistently set to ""2"" out of ""5"", except on days that are above 50, when I open the windows and shut off the heat for a few hours, so the heating didn't have anything to do with the bill change, either. 

Also remember that I've got a conservatory's worth of plants in my apartment, and the lights stay on all day. 

<b>Changes I made:</b>
<ul>
<li>Unplugged the toaster when it wasn't in use.</li> 
<li>Unplugged all of the chargers. This included
<ul><li>Cell phones
<li>PSPs and DSs
<li>IPods</li></ul>
<li>Flipped the surge protector ""off."" This disconnects
<ul><li>Computer
<li>printer
<li>speakers</li></ul>
<li>Flip the surge protector for the TV, cable, router, and phone when no one is going to be home.</li>
<li>Switched to energy-efficient lightbulbs. More expensive to buy, but they take, literally, years to burn out.
</ul>

I unplug everything when Steve leaves for work. When Steve gets home, I plug everything back in again. 

The biggest energy saver is probably switching off the computer's surge protector (which is essentially just like unplugging it.) 

<b>The whole unplugging process takes about 90 seconds,</b> more if Nate's hanging off me. That's less time than it takes to make the bed. And when I get a chance to use the computer during the day, which isn't that often, I just remember to shut it down and ""unplug"" it when I'm done. 90 seconds of minimal effort a day, and <b>we've saved over $150 this month.</b> 

""They"" say that your electronics suck more energy plugged in and off than they do when they're switched on, so this month was a sort of experiment to test that theory. Tentatively, it looks like ""They"" might be right. 

I'm continuing the experiment this month, and if we see another drop (it should be more substantial, since we were on vacation for 10 days) I'll make it a continual habit."

"event","Last two days I've been very sick. Throwing-up sick. Luckily, it's over now, and I've been able to get on with the important things in life, like Packing for Disney.

Checked the weather forecast, and all next week we've got highs in the high 70's and night-time lows in the 50's. A spot of rain here and there, but that's OK! The lowest low they're calling for all week is 51F, so I'm expecting to be a happy camper.

I've got the tent, sleeping bags, diapers and baby food packed. Still working on the laundry, so packing the clothes isn't done yet. 

My biggest fear for the week is my plants. I don't have anyone to water them, and we're going to be gone for 10 days. I'm hoping that they'll be OK with a thorough watering tomorrow, if I clump them all together in the living room. Clumping them helps them retain water, sort of like making a tiny biodome. It's worked before, but 10 days? That's a long stretch, and I'm nervous. 

On the plus side, I've got more videos up on YouTube. Nap time is my most productive two hours of the day!

"event","I've changed my mind, yet again, on having this journal public/private. I'm going back to public. Now that I've gotten the hang of the privacy controls, I'm pretty confident that I can filter out the trolls and arseholes. Besides, I don't see the point in blogging if no one can read it, it seems sort of whiny and juvenile to me, and hell, I just don't want to run my journal that way. ""Boo hoo, someone was mean to me on the internets, I'm taking my blog and going home."" No, I just can't do it. So, back to public.

Making the entries public again is going to take a long time. There are certain entries here that are very definitely friends-only, which means that I have to hand-change the security on each one. Which, in turn, means that this may never get done. Making all this public again is just one more thing on my growing to-do list. *shrug*"

"event","Really really quick updates:

I've finished two more books, ""American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War on America"" by Chris Hedges and, haha, that's funny, I can't remember the other one atm. That's what I get for trying to rush. Anywho, the reviews will be coming soon to literaryhos.I don't think you have to join the community to read the posts. Could be wrong though. 

Nate's birthday was this past Saturday. Mom threw him a party, and she didn't go terribly overboard, which was a nice surprise. When she asked me what theme Nate might like, I suggested pirates. ""Isn't he a little young for pirates?"" she asked. ""No,"" I chided her, ""he's just the right age. For mommy to pick what he wants. And I say he wants pirates."" I don't know if Nate had an opinion on the decorations--he seems to like just about everything--but everyone else liked them, and mommy got to have Johnny Depp on her cake. (^.^)

Sleeping: I slept poorly all last week. The party was crowded and went on FOREVER, and it was truly too much of a strain on my nerves. Then I had less than an hour to clean the apartment and shower before the game on Sunday, and while I love gaming, it's not as much fun when you have to be the hostess and the baby-sitter too. I also slept poorly this weekend. So it's no surprise that I've got a cold now, and generally feel like crap. But since I'm trying to put a positive spin on things--new year resolution and all--I'll say, ""at least it's not the flu, and I still have all this lovely housework to keep my occupied.""

There's more I want to write, but Nate won't nap and he's wailing in his crib right now so I have to cut it short. Maybe I'll get a chance to write more later."

<b>I Am A:</b> Neutral Good Elf Druid/Wizard (3rd/2nd Level)
<br><br><u>Ability Scores:</u><br>
<b>Strength-</b>12<br>
<b>Dexterity-</b>11<br>
<b>Constitution-</b>14<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>15<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>13<br>
<b>Charisma-</b>12
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Neutral Good</b> A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them. Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means doing what is good without bias for or against order. However, neutral good can be a dangerous alignment because because it advances mediocrity by limiting the actions of the truly capable.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are known for their poetry, song, and magical arts, but when danger threatens they show great skill with weapons and strategy. Elves can live to be over 700 years old and, by human standards, are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. Elves are slim and stand 4.5 to 5.5 feet tall. They have no facial or body hair, prefer comfortable clothes, and possess unearthly grace. Many others races find them hauntingly beautiful.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Druids</b> gain power not by ruling nature but by being at one with it. They hate the unnatural, including aberrations or undead, and destroy them where possible. Druids receive divine spells from nature, not the gods, and can gain an array of powers as they gain experience, including the ability to take the shapes of animals. The weapons and armor of a druid are restricted by their traditional oaths, not simply training. A druid's Wisdom score should be high, as this determines the maximum spell level that they can cast.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Wizards</b> are arcane spellcasters who depend on intensive study to create their magic. To wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art. When they are prepared for battle, wizards can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. The wizard's strength is her spells, everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. A wizard can call a familiar- a small, magical, animal companion that serves her. With a high Intelligence, wizards are capable of casting very high levels of spells.

I can't complain about this one. Yes, it's short notice and exemplifies my mother's typical lack of consideration: ""why <i>wouldn't</i> anyone be able to pick up with two weeks notice and cavort down to Florida for a ten-day vacation?""

But really, how can I possibly complain? We're going down on the first, coming back on the tenth. We're driving down in the RV, which kind of sucks, but once we get there I get my own camp site (have to share it with Steve, but--oh noez! sleep with my husband for a week? The inhumanity--whatever!) Mom & dad are taking care of Nate and paying for everything except souvenirs.

So that's the news. I feel bad that we're not going to the Wicked Faire; I had my heart set on it. But it's DISNEY. I can't feel <i>that</i> bad. 

YEY!"

"event","My mom got back from the hospital yesterday.

Yes, I was rather surprised, as well. No one told <i>me</i> she was going to the hospital, either. 

Apparently she needed her thyroid taken out. All that talk about  thyroid problems--""oh, it's my thyroid making me fat,"" and ""oh, I'm so tired all the time because of my thyroid,""--were partially true. Mom did have a severely swollen thyroid. Now, what <i>caused</i> the thyroid problem? What came first, her poor health habits or the thyroid problem? I know the answer to that, but I'm not about to remind her that she was grossly unhealthy before her thyroid enlarged, not right after she's gotten out of the hospital. Mom wants an easy solution. She's wanted an easy solution for years and years. She waited for an easy solution for so long, she developed thyroid problems, and now she's had it removed. There's her easy solution. See, God does answer your prayers, mom. Never mind that she probably won't see the irony in the answer.

Now she's got no thyroid, but she's still fat and unhealthy and in complete denial about how bad her habits are. Nothing's going to get better for her from here on out, not unless she takes this as a sign and starts changing her ways. But  she probably won't. She hasn't in twenty years, so why should she now? Especially now that the ""source"" of her ""problems"" has been removed?

I'm really sad and really disappointed, and that's coming out in a torrent of bitter snark. Still, I don't know how else to react. The woman could have taken care of herself, eaten right instead of going on crazy diet after crazy diet, exercised just a little bit every day, watched her water intake and popped some multivitamins, and never even developed this problem. And I can say this with absolute conviction, because, frankly, I pay attention, I've been to the professionals, I've worked through these problems, and I've watched her avoid and stall and get further and further into the sinkhole of denial and disease. And it <i>is</i> a disease, when it's gotten so bad you wreck your thyroid! She'll be diabetic in a few more years, you mark my words!

I am so, so, so upset by this whole thing. I can't even express how upset it has me without getting angry. 

And you know the ""best"" part? They nicked her larynx pretty badly, and now she can't talk above a whisper, <i>and</i> the doctor thinks it might end up being permanent. Which is fine, since women shouldn't be permitted to speak in public anyway, or some junk--isn't that what her God says? So there. He's taken away her ""problem"" <i>and</i> her voice. I hope she's happy! Damn it, and she'll never appreciate the irony, the, what should I call it? Divine chastisement. And I do see this as the Fates being a bit, well, Wyrd, Fate-like. Give and take, and with a lesson in it for you, and yes, a touch cruel; They can certainly be cruel. 

So my mom's out of the hospital, and recovering from the nausea, and unable to talk. And I'm upset and unable to express my hurt. And that's how we start our day today."

This is probably where the root of our clash lies, in fact, because I am patently <i>not</i> thoughtful, and I've grown callused by years of living with exceedingly <i>not</i> thoughtful parents, and standing in the light of actual selfless thoughtfulness makes me feel a little like wilting, or hiding in shame. So their Niceness makes me uncomfortable. That's not their fault. It's mine. And now that I've come to this minor revelation, I'll be making an effort to be more reciprocative and less of a humbug. 

For all that they occasionally come up with ...odd?... gifts, they're unstintingly generous. And not ""generous"" like I grew up knowing it. You know what I mean? The kind of ""generous"" that you never wanted, especially because it repeatedly gets thrown back in your face? No, they're actually, truly <i>generous</i>, the kind of generous that doesn't <i>want</i> anything back. Not that kind that just claims to want no reciprocation, but the kind that actually doesn't want reciprocation, doesn't look for reciprocation, and doesn't ask for reciprocation after the fact. My in-laws give because they want to. I suspect that they even <i>like</i> to give, and not because of the attention or gratitude it may garner them. Now that's the kind of generosity I've aspired to all my life, and here they are being that way naturally. I find that to be sincerely impressive. 

Finally, they're still the only set of parents I've got that's ever wished me a merry Yule. And they did it again this year. Sent us no less than <i>three</i> winter-themed cards, each one with a nice, sappy, non-religious Hallmark message in it, and on one of them actually wished me, in black and white, best wishes for ""The Winter Solstice (Yule)"". Now that's just about the best present any parent could give their kid: unconditional acceptance and respect. I can't say how much that means to me. The words elude me. 

So Number Three on the grateful thing: My Parents-in-law."

<center>by Garrett Eisler</center>


There's a war being waged against our sacred winter holiday, people. Centuries ago, our forebearers at this time of year began exchanging gifts, decorating trees, and welcoming the winter solstice with the return of light and end of darkness. All in the name of our beloved God. Yes, you know who I mean. Even in these heathen times, I'm not ashamed to speak his name: Saturn. There, I said it. Let's stop denying who this holiday is really about.

What has become of our holy Saturnalia, fellow pagans? I go into my local Wal-Mart, greeted by all the familiar holly and ivy of yore, and am welcomed not with the rousing ""Io, Saturnalia!"" of simpler times, but with some made-up newfangled, supposedly ""non-offensive"" substitute: this ""Christ-Mass"" thing.

Now about these ""Christians."" (Is that okay? ""People of Jesus""? What's the acceptable term now?) I know they have come a long way since we used to feed them to the lions in (let's face it) the good old days. And I've personally apologized and atoned for that. Many times.

And I don't begrudge them one bit their hard work, cleverness, and control of all media. Not to mention Congress, the Supreme Court and the White House.

But do we all have to bow down to their holidays now? I mean, it was bad enough when Yom Kippur and Rosh Hoshana got on my desk calendar somehow! And who is this ""MLK"" guy, anyway?

I'm sorry, but when your faithful still don't make up a majority of the world's population, and you've only been around less than 2,000 years, you gotta take a back seat to tradition. We don't want to offend you and, hey, you're welcome to come share in a finely roasted boar's head at our table and sing tuneful Saturn-carols any time. You see, you don't have to be pagan to enjoy Saturnalia! In fact, you're not, and yet you still use many of our rituals. Why don't you just call them by their right names?

And who knows when this guy, Jesus, was born anyway, right? I mean, isn't it just a little coincidental your story says he was born on ""Christmas Day""? Duh!

I know I'm going to get emails now saying I'm ""intolerant"" and all, but you have to stand up for the values that have made Western Civilization great. (And what's more Western Civ than good ol' pagan Ancient Rome?) You can't just give into these arrivistes. Next thing you know, they'll be appropriating our regeneration-of-spring festivities for the ""resurrection"" of their ""lord."" How are they going to fit the fertility bunnies into that, huh?

So to my Jesus-loving friends, I say this in the yuletide (oy, another appropriation!) spirit of forgiveness and peace on earth. No one minds what you celebrate in private. Just remember: it's Saturn's world and you just live in it.

So to all and to one, Saturn bless us all. Everyone."

""I cannot stress this enough. If you surprise someone with a car for Christmas, there is something seriously fucking wrong with you. Doubly so if you go with the giant bow...

""<b>Cars should be chosen. Picked out. Thought about. They are a major purchase, not an impulse buy.</b> If you're making that kind of financial decision and not telling the other person in your life about it, either you're a complete moron for whom all the Christmas morning glee will bite you on the ass when the bill comes due, or you have too much fucking money and shouldn't be flaunting it by parking CARS WITH BOWS ON THEM in your front yard."" (bold added by me)

<lj-cut>
Seriously, having gotten three--yes, three--cars as gifts, I think I have an indisputable right to comment on this sentiment. Am I grateful for the cars? Yeeeeees, because I couldn't afford them on my own and anything's better than shelling out all that cash for what passes as ""public transportation"" in this country. 

HOWEVER--and I realize that, yet again, I sound like an ungrateful bitch for saying this, but--these were decisions on which I should have been consulted. Two of the cars I received did not suit my needs at all, and the one I'm driving right now was not only, IMHO, too expensive, it's also a hulking monster and a gas guzzler, both of which I can afford almost as little as I can afford relying on public transit. 

While I appreciate, to a point, the sentiment, I can't help realizing that the decision to ""surprise"" me with a car was made less for my sake, and more for the self-gratification of the gift givers. After all, I wasn't consulted at all in the decisions, and the cars didn't match my needs or my wants. Sort of flies in the face of the very idea of Giving A Gift. But it <i>does</i> make my mother look awfully generous, doesn't it, having bought her daughter <i>three</i> cars? 

I'm grateful that someone, somewhere, would agree with me on this. And that is Grateful Thing #2."

A Nativity scene goes up at the City Hall. There's a general stir: some folks love it, some folks hate it. The mayor says, Look, anyone wants to put up <i>their</i> religious holiday symbols, fine, because this is a free country. 

So Circle Sanctuary takes them up on the offer. They put a lovely wreath, with a pentagram in the center--very tasteful, very simple--on the roof of City Hall, next to the creche. 

Of course,  some guy decides to vandalize the Yule Pentacle.  

The council decides that NO other religious symbols will be allowed to go up, until they can work out some ""guidelines.""

The Nativity scene, however, will remain until then end of December.

The White House holiday cards quote the Bible. Presidential nominees are ignoring the real issues to argue about who loves Jesus the most. Christian religious symbols festoon our government buildings, paid for and maintained by our tax dollars. Yet Christians still scream that <i>they</i> are being persecuted in this country."

"event","Finished <u>The Saint</u> omnibus by Dan Abnett. The four novels--<i>Honour Guard</i>, <i>Guns of Tanith</i>, <i>Straight Silver</i>, and <i>Sabbat Martyr</i>--hook us back up with Abnett's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaunt's_Ghosts"">Ghosts</a>, the Tanith First-and-Only regiment that's become a perennial favorite with sci-fi and war novel fans alike. 

As you may know, Abnett ranks as one of my all-time favorite authors, so obviously I'm going to praise him.<lj-cut> 

<u>Setting</u>

His grasp of scene, of place, which comes through powerfully in this particular collection. Each novel is set on a different world, each world strikingly unique. On the beautiful pilgrimage-world Hagia, troopers slog through resplendent rainforests to battle their way to the tip of the snow-blasted holy mountains. On chemical-scorched Phantine, above a deadly sea of billowing poison gas, they drop blindly from city-sized dirigibles onto the embattled decks of mountaintop biodomes. On feudal Axegary, the war is entrenched, both literally and politically. On insignificant, obsideae-crusted Herodor--hundreds of thousands of pilgrims choking the ancient, unfortified capital--no one can believe that the enemy would bother attacking, until it's almost too late.  

Yes, you can tell that Abnett draws inspiration for most of his settings from the real world. Hagia reminds one powerfully of Tibet, while Axegary has a definite Bavarian flair. Herodor, in some respects, resembles a nightmarish Siberia, and Phantine's domed cities are full of fabulously dilapidated Steam-age grandeur. Describing it this way may seem to imply that the locations are shoddy rip-offs of real-world cliches, but don't let my own lack of literary flair fool you: Abnett has yet to succumb to the shoddy or cliched. 

<u>Character</u> 

In these three novels, we get to know characters that up until now have been sitting quietly in the backseat. With the first three  books in the Tanith series so masterfully executed, there's no risk of ""forgetting"" about one of the main characters as we get to know the secondary ones; much like real life, you don't forget about your old friends when you make new ones! Further, every writer who deals with more than a handful of characters runs a serious risk of having some of them turn out cartoon-like and ""typed."" For the most part, Abnett avoids that. It's a relief, too, that he's good enough of a writer to pull this off, because there are a <i>lot</i> of Ghosts. 

There <i>are</i> some weak points, at least initially. Ban Daur, the fourth ranking Ghost, never really fleshes out, remaining rather a bland slice of white bread, even though he's been with us for seven novels now. Caffran, a major-minor character, while likable, seems a touch too much of a ""typical good guy."" John Cusack would play him in the movie. Tona Criid, who shines when she's first introduced, seems to flatten out by the fourth book. And Lijia Cuu, who becomes, by the second book, arguably one of the most disturbing characters in the 40K universe, <i>starts</i> as a cookie-cutter meanie-pants, vaguely threatening, but mostly just, well, predictable.

<u>Style</u>

I have to give Abnett one thumb up and one thumb down here. 

Some parts of these novels are so well written my heart started racing. The dirigible drop on Phantine was superbly written. When describing the trench fighting on Axegary, he blends in the statistical and tactical data in manageable chunks that actually enhance the feel of the dramatic scenes. I've yet to read another war novelist who can do that (though please, if you know any, make a suggestion.) 

Some parts are not written quite as well. <i>Sabbat Martyr</i> revolves around a series of bona fide miracles. Yet I wasn't filled with awe. Steve's opinion was that Abnett just doesn't write divine revelation well. I think I agree. While he does a good job writing clergy and laymen, be they devout, disillusioned, indifferent or downright hypocritical, he just doesn't do well with... I can't say much about this without giving some serious plot away, but his handling of the ""divine"" leaves much wanting. 

On Cursing: The first Tanith trilogy was, as far as I can remember, completely devoid of any common curses, saving the safe-for-prime-time ass, damn, and hell. Each planetary culture has its own system of slang, and Abnett was nearly unerring in executing each patois. In this quartet, the word ""shit"" is used freely, and it seriously jeopardizes the books' atmosphere. Where did these guys pick up the word ""shit,"" when no one in the entire Sabbat starsystem uses that word? It may sound like a small detail, but good writing is nothing <i>but</i> small details, and this one is actually a glaring faux pas.
</lj-cut>
Overall, on a 1-10 scale, The Saint gets a hearty, solid 8.5."

I don't wish to sound ungrateful for all of the nice things you've given me, and all of the other mainstream American children, through the years, but I have to put my foot down and insist that you <i>not</i> include religious materials with those that you give to my son. Please be advised that this sort of thing calls into serious question your years of unstinting generosity. Further, if it continues, I will have to put a stop to your once-a-year visits, goody-bag and all.

I was unaware that you were a devout Christian. I was also unaware that you are on an aggressive campaign to convert people into your group while they were young, impressionable, and easily bought with mountains of candy, cookies, and toys. The first quality is, I grant, admirable. I can personally relate to feelings of deep spirituality, and I congratulate you on finding your personal path to the Divine. As to the second quality, I confess that I consider it frankly unethical, and I must remind you that in this multi-faith country proselytizing is considered bad manners.

Finally, allow me a scholar's conceit reminding you that December 25th is not, in fact, the birth date of Jesus of Nazareth. According to the New Testament--considered by most Christians to be the definitive source of information pertaining to Jesus's life--this date would be some time in spring or summer, not winter. I would further point out that even this is conjecture, since the precise date of Jesus's birth is not noted within this text. I will not ask you to refrain from calling Jesus the ""Christ,"" as I recognize that this is a matter of faith for your religion. However, I must insist that you do not pepper my child's head with blatant literary falsehoods. 

With sincerity, and, above all, wishing you a cheery and bright holiday season,

Me."

"event","Two years ago, when we were looking into buying a house (some of you might remember the string of fiascoes that caused) we were mostly working off of hopes of a sort of mortgage I'd never heard of before. They didn't need ""proof"" of income, just my husband's word about what he made, and we'd have a nice two year grace period with low payments. 

I didn't like the sound if it, at the time. I didn't trust Steve's ""sure thing"" projected income; you probably remember all the complaining I did about it at the time. I didn't trust that we'd be ""fine"" in two years, able to take whatever they threw at us. I was very unhappy with the expense of the houses, which I felt was ridiculously inflated. These were tiny bungalows, and they all needed a lot of work, and yet we were getting ""deals"" at 300K. I was secretly glad when the deals fell through, one by one. Clearly, the Fates did not wish us to own a house yet.

Now. Well. You have to know what's going on with the housing and mortgage markets. The newsbots are calling it ""a crisis,"" and I think they might be right.

"event","A bunch of my friends have been asking me lately why I don't just (fill in the blank) to solve some of the problems I've been having lately: the job search, the boredom, and so on.

Short Answer: Finding time to string two sentences together is very challenging. If those two sentences have to sound good and relate to each other, well then forget it, because sustaining concentration is just not going to happen. 
<lj-cut text=""Beware the bitching."">
For a job as mind-numbing and idiotic as baby-raising, it eats up a shocking amount of time and brains. 

Do I have help? Yes, I do. Steve helps a LOT. 

But here's the complicated part, and, also, the bit where we hit the ""Long Answer"": by the time Steve gets home, the truth is I'm so depressed I just curl up in bed and cry. It's burning me out, doing this day after day. There's a lot adding to the problem, a lot that I just don't have the heart to go into, and being unmedicated doesn't help. 

And this is where I sound like an ungrateful bitch, but it's my blog and if I'm going to be honest well then I ought to be honest all the way. 

All the well-meaning advice, frankly, makes it worse. I feel like everyone thinks I'm a complete idiot. Do you all really think I'm not smart enough to think of something as simple as asking my husband to babysit, or checking Monster.com for jobs? And then I wonder, if my friends think I'm this dumb, how dumb, really, in fact,  *am* I? And that truthfully does <i>nothing</i> to help my already abysmal self-esteem. 

Explaining just exactly, precisely, <i>how</i> wretched I've been feeling lately is probably causing me more stress than it ought to. Mostly because every time I try to explain, I'm bombarded with a crap-wagon of well-intentioned rubbish that just reinforces the impression that no one is <i>listening</i> to a word I'm saying. 

I don't want to <i>hear</i> that this mindless never-ending drudgery is the Epitome of what I, as a woman, Should Be Living For. I don't want to <i>hear</i> that this private hell of idiotic servitude is the Most Noble Job Any Woman Could Hope To Have. And I don't want my very real, very painful, very hopelessly deadening situation reduced to a handful of low-calorie soundbite solutions. 

Maybe that comes out sounding whiny and shallow, but what the fuck? My whole existence has been reduced to a menial and demeaning string of pointless, thankless drudgery. I am shackled to the most hellish labor I could have ever envisioned. Forgive me for being a little pissy. 

So whatever. I'm stuck where I am. A job just doesn't look like it's coming. I doubt I'm even employable anymore. I certainly don't <i>feel</i> employable, and when you're trying to find a job they really amount to the same thing. Plus I'm nearly suicidally depressed, and the only doc I've been able to make an appointment with--in two months of searching and fruitless unreturned phone calls--is going to be charging me $200 a session until I meet some ridiculous deductible. Which we don't have, so I'll probably be canceling that appointment. 

I'm not going to curl up and die. I'd like to, but I'm not going to. Just don't expect me to be too fucking cheery and sociable for a while."

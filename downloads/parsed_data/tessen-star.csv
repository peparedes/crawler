"event","Ow... I'm sorry, you guys... I just woke up and I'm in a LOT of pain... and I mean a LOT. I think-- my dad said I'm in the hospital and it makes sense because my room isn't white and clean and tidy like that... man, it's kinda hard to breath... and my leg's itchy.

What happened was, as far as I can remember... well, I put on my swimming trunks in the morning because I wanted to go swimming with Arashi and everyone... and then dad needed help with a new batch of kunai, so I helped him... and then I went out and-- well, I don't remember... my parents say that it looks like something fell on me and smashed me, but there were no witnesses and-- owwwww...

*sniff* Pain. And it's lonely here and smells like old people.

((OOC: in real life, I just got my first temp job and in the first two days, it totally killed me. I should be a little more awake from now on, though. XD;))"

"event","I bought a new pair of swimming trunks! They're dark blue with a yellow stripe on each side. Very simple, but they're good for me!

It's a shame I missed a trip to the water park... the guys went just when I was buying my trunks. oh well! I'm going to swim on Thursday anyway. Arashi, you're coming, right? And everyone is invited! We're going to celebrate the fact that I have a puppy now! Subaru likes water a lot so he'll come too."

"event","Hooray~! I had so much fun today!

I went on a stroll in the morning because I had nothing better to do, and then I ended up in the Ninja Academy! I joined Iruka-sensei's new class. They had a substitute teacher from Suna, Hakusen, and I met Arashi and Michiru in person! And all those other new people! Michiru is actually Hakusen's cousin! They were both so cool! And Arashi is sweet.

Then I went to eat yakiniku and dango and I found out I have a lot in common with Arashi! That was really great. Rena showed me some cute pictures of him when he was small! He was so adorable. Oh, Arashi bought me the dango! I didn't have enough money, so he was nice and bought it for me! Hooray~!

We sang karaoke and danced and stuff, and then Hatake Kane and Shiranui Daiki came, and then this guy, Tsugai, arrived, and he was all weird and Kane and Daiki had to hide from him... that was weird. And the others mentioned that I look like an Uchiha... they're not the first ones to say that. Weird... Oh, and Rena and Kitari kept talking about swords but they were really... and apparently I was a couch or something. What...?

OHH!! But Tsugai threw this puppy at me and he is SO CUTE!!! I named him Subaru. And my parents are actually letting me keep him! I pouted my best for it. I HAVE A PUPPY NOW~!!

And I'm going swimming with Arashi and the others on Thursday! Gotta buy new trunks! My old ones are all small...

<lj-cut text=""Locked, can't be read by Arashi"">

Rena and Kitari said that Arashi has a crush on me. Is that true? I really haven't noticed... what should I do about it? I mean, I like Arashi, but... like that? I dunno...</lj-cut>"

"event","Yaaaaay! I like being a Chuunin! Okay, so I haven't really done anything as a Chuunin yet, but people are already showing me a lot more respect than they did when I was a Genin. That's <i>awesome</i>.

Dad closed his weapon store yesterday morning and took me to the Hokage to get me all my Chuunin things in order. And to get my vest fitted! I have a Chuunin vest~! Of course, I'm not going to wear it for missions and stuff. It's ugly and bulky, and I don't like this shade of green at all. I'll wear it on official meetings and stuff like that, but that's it.

Then dad took me to eat yakiniku, and after that he bought me dango! YAY!! And he kept saying how proud he is of me. That was <i>really</i> nice.

But he still won't get me a puppy. <i>C'mon.</i> No fair. I'm a Chuunin now and I want a puppy and I promised I'll take really good care of it and no one in our family is allergic so why can't I get one? Bwaaah. Sometimes I wish I was an Inuzuka because they have dogs. But then again, they fight with the dogs, and I don't want to hurt my puppy, so I guess I don't really want to be an Inuzuka. Being Tessen Hoshi is okay by me, anyway. But I still want a dog.

But I don't have time to feel bad (I'll get a dog eventually for sure, anyway) about that 'cause I'm a Chuunin now! So happy~"

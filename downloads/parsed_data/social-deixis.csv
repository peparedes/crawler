"event","Well, this explains a lot:<br /><br />  I<em>n conclusion, this study provides further evidence that experiencing<sup> </sup>allergic reactions engenders fatigue and depressive feelings.<sup> </sup>Research in psychoneuroimmunology and medical genetics provides<sup> </sup>support for the argument that <strong>experiencing allergic reactions<sup> </sup>induces biochemical changes that affect the central nervous<sup> </sup>system directly and produce the vegetative symptoms of depression:<sup> </sup>emotional and social withdrawal, mental fatigue, malaise, decreased<sup> </sup>activity, and loss of interest in usual activities. </strong>These allergic<sup> </sup>reactions are usually not producing all the symptoms present<sup> </sup>in major depression. For the great majority of individuals with<sup> </sup>allergic rhinitis do not report having been treated for major<sup> </sup>depression (</em><a href=""http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/64/4/684#R8-098059""><em>8</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/64/4/684#R9-098059""><em>9</em></a><em>). Rather, it appears that, when present with<sup> </sup>other factors such as chronic stress, allergic reactions might<sup> </sup>very well contribute biochemically to onset of depression in<sup> </sup>some individuals. Epidemiological and other studies suggest<sup> </sup>that having allergies does contribute in some manner to the<sup> </sup>development of depression (</em><a href=""http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/64/4/684#R5-098059""><em>5</em></a><em>&ndash;</em><a href=""http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/64/4/684#R11-098059""><em>11</em></a><em>). Therefore, research<sup> </sup>to clarify the relationship between these illnesses is clearly<sup> </sup>warranted.</em><br /><br />From:&nbsp; http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/64/4/684<br /><br />"

"event","""There's something that happens around the 20-mile mark.""&nbsp; A lot of people said this before the race, but no one could really articulate what it was.&nbsp; Some called it a wall, some said it was something magical.&nbsp; No one could articulate with much precision what ""it"" was.&nbsp; I'll likely have similar trouble describing the actual feelings, but I can tell you about what happened.<br /><br />So, I come past the 20 mile marker, and think, ""Huh.&nbsp; I don't really feel any different.&nbsp; Maybe 'that thing' is really nothing.""&nbsp; Then, as I'm closing in on 21 miles, I come to a water table staffed with volunteers.&nbsp; Some of the groups of volunteers along the way had taken it upon themselves to dress up for the event.&nbsp; For example, one table had a bunch of guys in identical ""Risky Business"" type ensembles--white shirt, underpants, sunglasses--and they danced the water cup into runners' hands.&nbsp; Another group had multi-colored wigs &amp; pom-poms.<br /><br />I didn't see that there was a ""theme"" at the table between miles 20 and 21.&nbsp; All I saw, through my sweaty haze, was a tall man in a full Lucha Libre (Mexican Wrestler) costume--mask, tights, cape--the works.&nbsp; He raised a fist in a ""Viva la raza"" salute, and I saluted him in return.&nbsp; I shouted, ""Viva La Raza!"" as I high-fived him &amp; passed his table.&nbsp; Then, I laughed and laughed and laughed my way through the next two miles thinking about ""that thing that happens around mile 20,"" and how, for me, it would involve a luchador.<br /><br />I realized much later that he was dressed as ""Nacho Libre,"" the Jack Black character, but that's O.K.&nbsp; He was my hero luchador between miles 20 and 21, and he got me through to mile 23.<br /><br />Here he is (he wasn't holding the baby when I saw him):<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Pic""><br /> <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/social_deixis/pic/00038wdy/""><img width=""265"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/social_deixis/pic/00038wdy/s320x240"" /></a></div><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/social_deixis/pic/00038wdy/""></a>"

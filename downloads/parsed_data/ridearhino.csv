And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only i will remain"" (p14)

Typing away and the sensor light goes on outside. who's there? no-one of course, not at this time of night. it is generally a cat. yet every time it happens now i get a panic rush. nerves so tense - readying for anything. it is not easy for the mind to control the instincts."

the realisation gave a sense of relief and peace. there is someone that i don't have to worry about what they know and what they don't. i have trusted them more than any other person so do, but don't, need to worry about what i say - if you know what i mean."

went to canberra for the last few days. the manager, greg, took me for a 5km run around Lake Burley Griffin (i've never run that far in my life so felt pretty good about making it). apart from the wind being icy cold off the water (got down to -4 overnight), the sunset was gorgeous with the red streeking through the clouds. canberra is a lovely city and the lake area is supurb with the court couse, parliament house, anzac parade and other landmarks sprinkled amoung heaps of parkland and the lake.

greg and his wife live in queenbeyan. their house backs onto vacant land with rolling hills. The grass was covered with frost in the morning, lots of trees out in blossom, a number of kangaroos feeding just over the back fence and crimson rosellas feeding next door.

"event","read an article commenting on how society in Australia is changing. i enjoy that type of thing where one stands back and looks at the big picture. 

Said the 90's were a time of personal depression with job insecurity, unemployment, continual change, suicide (though to me this is an effect rather than a cause). Said lots of big issues around the world with wars, economic rationism, poverty and so on and that people felt powerless to have an impact. The current decade he says has seen a more positive change in people. They are happier which he saw as a good change (which it is). The reason though is people have largely given up on trying to deal with the big issues and focus on what they have control over. People stopped watching the news and now watch reality tv. they spend for now rather than saving. what video they will hire for the week has a much higher importance. 

i have felt powerless myself quite often and finding a way to live life more posiively in good, but is cutting oneself off the answer?

it just didn't work for me though. not sure why. maybe in the back of my mind i was worried about whether katrina was ok with it all seeing the other person was female, not that she's given any indication of a problem - i've just seen in the past how jealous people can get and consequences get all out of hand.

maybe it was that i fell over heaps. i have been up a few times this year and was getting quite confident and feeling good about myself getting better. then reality check. there is so little in life that say i can do well, particularly sport where i get to mediocre and that's it. that eye hand co-ordination thing just doesn't seem to happen. i think it needs to be learned when really young. i played my new x box against david a couple of days ago. the winner was the first to kill the other 25 times. he gave me so many chances but still won by 26!!! i managed to kill myself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your first name of Stephen creates a serious, thoughtful nature, shrewd, efficient, and business-minded. You are one to make your own decisions, and not be influenced by others. You desire independence and freedom from the authority and interference of others. You are not overly ambitious, preferring instead just to seek stable, settled conditions which are adequate to meet your responsibilities. In your personal relations with others, you are inclined to be rather serious, and not to see the humour others see, or to respond spontaneously. Your positive manner and outlook can make others feel that you are imposing your will on them and even interfering in their affairs. Weaknesses in your health caused by the influence of this name centre in the head. Head colds, sinus conditions, hay-fever, and weak eyes are relative conditions. Also, your tendency to worry can lead to insomnia and other overwrought conditions.

"event","today was a good day. for 3 years i've been working on linking our 7 depots together electronically and its just about finished. the co-ordination and cutting edge technology has been a pain but at the same time it's been a challenge and fun.

With our phones i've taken about 40 separate phone bills from five different companies and put them together as one and linked the depots with a permanent phone and data connection so calls between them are free. The last stage is to make the system smart enough to know if i want to ring someone in Melbourne from Albury that the call goes for free to Melbourne through our line then out as an untimed local call in Melbourne. That means calls pretty much to any capital city in Australia for 15 cents. We now have all the answers on how to do it and within a couple more months can be finished. yeah!

It's great to have a vision and make it happen

You might think ok, sounds no big deal. think about it though - not only have we technologically linked everyone but it is changing the culture from self centred local operations to a unified like minded organism. being a part of changing how a few hundred people act and think (even if in a small way) and making their lives different is pretty amazing. people now do things - whether they know it or not - because i came up an idea"

Tracey's instinctive response was ""I'm going to get Daniel!"" - not so much because that way she could tell him - but rather i must drive him home myself, i must protect my son, i can't let this happen to him.

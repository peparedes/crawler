"event","This overwhelming failure.
The inability to move on. 
One step forward, three steps back.
The vicious cycle turns round and round.
Open minded with nothing to say.
Close minded with no purpose.
Keeping  your distance but still too close.
Every turn is one for the worst. 
I feel it climbing back inside me, I thought that I had escaped it.
I know now there is no running, only tumbling.
Rolling downward, collecting it with every spin.
A bigger mess now that it has ever been. 
No help will be provided, no words of wisdom to hear.
Having to do this on my own, I have to conquer this fear."

"event","So today has been pretty good so far. I'm still really nervous about my class tonight but I'm sure it will be fine...I checked the site I bought my book at and it says estimated arrival date isn't until 8/27! ugh! I hope this is ok...Hopefully I'll be able to use someone else's book until then or something. 
So, my buddy at work was telling me about his marital problems a few minutes ago. It's sad. I can't really offer too much of an opinion because I really was shocked when I found out his situation. His wife is not at all what I picture him with physically or personality wise either really...and she has 3 kids that are not his and he has been supporting them all for the last 3 years until 2 weeks ago she finally got a job. Anyway, none of my business really but it is a shame to hear his problems. I wish there was something I could do to make him feel better. :-/  I'm pretty sure I'm over the whole Matt thing, the other guy at work....
I'm not sure that I have a crush on anyone really. I think I crave a lot of things I don't get from my own relationship and that is why I keep searching for someone new to fill the void. 
I mean I don't feel right in the head here lately. I have been very stressed out more than normal. I need to go to the damn Dr and get my meds again for my anxiety and adhd but I just don't have the money right now. ugh.
Anyway, I'm going to smoke countless cigarettes for the rest of my lunch break!"

"event","So, last night we went to Crowley's to see our friend's play. It was super fun while we were there but on the way home I was texting a friend and Mark flips out on me asking me who the hell I am texting and tries grabbing my phone from me to look through it. Well before he had went all flipping out on me my phone wouldn't let me reply to the last message I received because my texts were too full. So, I deleted all my messages and send the reply. So the only message in my phone was the one I sent last and he thinks I deleted all my messages so he couldn't see who I was talking to, which is ridiculous. I have nothing to hide. So he is all yelling at me and driving like a maniac, in my new car by the way, while drunk. not a fun situation. so anyway, he keeps saying he wants to see my phone bill when we get home and if i dont have one we could go online and look at it. I was perfectly fine with this because as I said I have nothing to hide. But, when we got home he went straight to bed. I went in there and was like I thought you wanted to see my phone bill and he was like whatever I'll look at it tomorrow. So, I had my paper version of my most recent phone bill sitting on the counter top all day, still up there, and he has not once looked at it. He had to work today so he left at about 7:30 this morning and forgot his cell phone here so I didn't talk to him until he got home at about 5:00 in which I asked if he was hungry, he said no, then he avoided me and stayed in a different room of the house until he went to ""the store"" and then he left for band practice and all he said while he was walking out of the house was ""see ya later"" I hate when he acts like this. It is so childish. 

On another note, I start my math class tomorrow. I'm nervous. 
I don't feel very good right now. I hope Mark is over this shit soon because it is one thing to be mad when you have a good reason but to be mad at me when I did nothing wrong...thats just annoying. I hate that he always tells me how I lie to him when he has never had a reason to say so but yet he is the one who lied to me before and it took him a year to come clean, I still stuck around! UGH."

I didn't realize classes started so early or that tuition was due today by 3pm! So, my mom, being the fantastic woman she is paid by credit card over the phone. I overdrew my bank account today so I could get my cell phone turned back on and buy the book for my class and put gas in my car. I won't get the book until 4 to 7 days from now so I won't have it for the first 2 classes...:-/ a little nervous about this. I really hate I have to go to the class without my book, I hope it will not be a big deal. 

Mark and I went to see pineapple express tonight. We got stoned before we went. It was pretty damn funny but not as funny as I thought it would be. I'm not much into slapstick comedy so some of it was really cheesy to me.

""I've got some real estate here in my bag""
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies
And we walked off to look for America

""Kathy,"" I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
""Michigan seems like a dream to me now""
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said ""Be careful his bowtie is really a camera""

""Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat""
""We smoked the last one an hour ago""
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

""Kathy, I'm lost,"" I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all gone to look for America
All gone to look for America
All gone to look for America


The above song is one of the many things that made me smile today. I have fabulous conversations with this really cool guy who is friends with a couple of my friends. He is gorgeous on the outside and I'm starting to find out he is pretty cool on the inside as well. No, I am not searching for a replacement for my current boyfriend. I know it seems I always have a new man to talk about, but I am starting to realize it is what you make of it. Mark and I have had some amazing times the last few days. He has been really nice for some reason and it feels like old times again. 

I have to register for my math class on Thursday and I don't know how I'm going to do this. ugh. I have no idea when I am going to be able to fit it in to my schedule with work. I'm praying maybe I can take a night class or online but I don't think either is an option for this class. :( I guess I will figure something out, I'll have to. 

Well, lunch break is almost over so I'm going to finish my chicken tendercrisp sandwich and smoke while enjoying my vanilla iced chai and then head back to work....where I will probably actually be on my laptop for because I am ALL caught up! haha"

"event","so i got paid today and went to deposit my check into my bank account and found out that my account was in the negative massively. i have $18 of my $300 paycheck left. My car insurance is due by the 14th and i don't get paid again until the 15th. my car payment is due on the 17th and i will not have enough to pay it by then. (insurance is $134 and car payment is $343) AND my cell phone bill was due a long time ago but i called and had them keep my phone on today because i was planning on paying it today so now my only phone is going to be cut off. im not happy at all about any of this. 

so i go back to work after spending my whole lunch break at the bank arguing with them about my account since i am used to bank of america's online banking and bb&t's is totally different and that is why i overdrew my account, and im so upset and stressed out that i am crying. I go into my manager's office and tell her what happened. I had one cigarette left and my gas light was on in my car and the needle was right at the bottom of the line. she advanced me $100 from next week's paycheck thankfully but that doesn't solve my bills being due. it got me gas, cigarettes and i had to buy some bathroom products. I now have $17 left until next friday. 

I start a part time fucking job next week working for my boyfriend's sister at holiday inn working the front desk. This means I will be working 7 days a week and I will have absolutely no days to sleep in. I can't even make it to my regular job at 8am and I will have to be at the part time job on Saturday and Sunday at 7am. I really need the money right now though so I will have to do this atleast until I get caught up and I would like to get maybe 2 months ahead on my bills. 

Friday night and we are not doing anything. We went to the grocery store. What an exciting night. I'm really sleepy. I think I may go to bed early tonight...but I know I'm fucking sleeping in tomorrow dude...it is my last god damn weekend not having to work. BLAH!!!!!

Whatever. I'm over my life as it is right now."

"event","So, I brought the laptop to work with me today. It was a fantastic idea because I piggy-backed off our work's WIFI and downloaded new music all day while I worked. Also, I actually had something to do during my hour lunch and when I finished everything on my desk. 
Today was pretty good I guess. The ONLY thing that <b>really</b> pissed me off today was the fucking dumb bitch Carol I have to work with.
I wish everyone could have the chance to meet this cunt. She is the exact definition of everything I hate. She is like 60 something but tries to act like she is in her 20's. She is shorter and not too unattractive in the facial area and not too thin but not overweight at all...but she has the most disgusting legs on a person that I have EVER seen. Her legs look as though she used to weigh about 1,000 lbs and lost all but 130 lbs. She has spider veins and cottage cheese lumps all over them...kind of elephantitus looking. I know, you are probably thinking damn, you are so shallow and such an immature bitch to be talking about some older lady like this...BUT, you would have to be around this lady to understand.
As I said before, I do ACCOUNTING among other jobs for a car dealership...like I'm also the dealer trade clerk...you know when dealerships buy and sell cars from each other's inventory. Anyway, the office I work in there has me, 3 other girls who do title work, post the deals and do some other internal accounting and then there is our office manager. Carol seems to think that since we are women in an office that we are nothing more then secretaries and janitorial staff. There is a receptionist that has a desk out on the sales floor who does some other things like filing, making car stickers, purchasing cars into our system and so on and also prints the letters for the service department and sales people. When the receptionist goes to lunch or steps away from the desk the phones are switched back to our office and we answer the phones while we continue to do our hectic jobs. Why am I ranting about our job duties? Because Carol continuiously comes back in our office and talks to us like we are below her. Our jobs could never be done by this woman as she is an idiot. The postage machine is in our office and everyone runs postage on their own mail, not hard to do right? Carol kept laying her stack of mail on top of the postage machine and would never put the postage on it herself. We would all joke about it because it was one more thing she did that got on our nerves. Every time a salesman would come in and run their postage they would pick up her stack and run hers too since it was just laying there to be done and all of us girls refused to do her job for her. One day one of the salesman finally asked us why there was always mail laying up there to have the postage ran on it. I told him it was because Carol refused to run her own mail and all of us left it there to teach her that her mail would go out sooner if she did her job right. This salesman is one of the funniest men I have ever met. He said ""I'll fix this."" He walked out and walked back in with Carol and said ""This is how you do it."" as he was running the postage Carol said ""I know how to do it. I was told to leave it in here for the girls to do!"" We all laughed and asked who told her that and she said that Jimmy the general manager of the store told her that. We then replied that he would never tell her that because even he runs his own mail and we are not her personal secretaries. Everyone dislikes this woman because she is rude, says inappropriate things all the time, steals sales from other salesmen and she's just plain gross. She wears short skirts with her nasty legs showing all the time and when she sits down she spreads her legs WIDE open so if you were walking by you would see everything! Anyways, the point of my story is that there have been countless situations with this woman that have made us all fislike her and today it took all I had not to punch her in the face. I had a really cute top that is bunchy up at the bust and real flowy everywhere else, you know a lot of tops out now are like this style and they are comfortable. I am not skinny. I know I am not skinny. This is my number one insecurity but I have been working out everyday for 3 weeks now and trying to change this about myself. I mean I'm not disgustingly fat and overweight...I wear a size 13 jeans. Anyway, today as I was walking back inside from smoking a cigarette and I was walking around the corner to our office door past Carol's desk she stopped me and said, ""Michelle, is that a maternity shirt!?"" She's very loud with everything she says so there is no telling who heard this but I was outraged. I was so pissed off all I could utter was um no. She then stated she didn't know because with the style of shirts out now they all look like maternity shirts to her. I just turned around and walked into our office. When I walked in all the girls could tell I was really pissed off and instantly asked me what had happened. I started out with oh my god I am so going to punch her in the face. They all laughed and asked oh god what did Carol do this time. So, I told them exactly what happened and they were all in shock and just as pissed off as I was. They all said she must just be plain evil because to say something like that knowing it would obviously hurt my feelings was just mean and uncalled for. I'm jumping around a lot with all of this because there is such a never ending story about what all this lady does and says that there is no way I could type it all out! 

Anyway, I told my manager and she was just as mortified as I was. I told her the next thing Carol says to me I am going to turn to her and plainly state to please not talk to me because  I do not care to associate with her or hear anything else rude and uncalled for she has to say. My manager agreed this was probably the best way to handle things. Unfortunately my manager is not Carol's manager or Carol would already be gone.

So, muffin. My boy at work. We started into a conversation today about dating people solely on looks alone. I don't really remember how the whole thing got started but we didn't get too much into it before we were interrupted by his manager. I just walked back inside because I was starting to get a little upset. I like him. I don't think he has any interest in me other than just friendship. I'm ok with this to a point but I don't want to hear it ever come straight out of his mouth. I have a feeling the only reason he isn't interested in me other than just friends is because I'm not thin. I hate this. This is why I always date guys way older than me. Guys my age or around my age are so shallow that they could care less what kind of connection they have with a girl as long as the girl was hot and by hot I mean has a good body. 

This society makes me sick. You watch TV or look at a magazine or even get on the internet and all you see are girls who have ""perfect bodies"". I don't hate girls like this. It isn't their fault that I'm fat and I don't think that they are dumb or boring just because they are pretty. I long to look like that. I long for guys to see me and think I am hot and then want to get to know me but I would be the one who had the deciding factor of wether or not I wanted to go any further with a relationship because I would know that everyone found me attractive and this was not IT. I'm sad. I have been working out and feel as though I am getting even larger. How is this possible?! I used to walk for months at a time and lose weight like over night. As soon as I did ANY form of exercise the weight would just melt right off of me...not anymore! I wish I had the will power to starve myself or something. Geez. 

I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about all my tattoos. I have a reason and meaning behind every tattoo I have on my body. I didn't get any of my tattoos to look cool...well that wasn't my main objective when I got them. Obviously people who are into tattoos think they are cool..but anyway, now they limit me I have come to find. Guys who are not attracted to modified girls rule me out immediately and I'm always sterotyped...not to mention the whole having to wear massive amounts of clothing to cover them up for work and family functions with my boyfriend's parents...since he is against my tattoos and his parents would probably have heart attacks if they knew I had a giant tattoo on my chest. 

I hate how the whole world and everything that exists is like one big oxymoron. Think about it. If you really sat and thought about one thing at a time you could probably see all sides of the issue and you would be just as confused as I am.

I was so excited to start using this journal again and now I'm just kind of like...wow I'm just rambling on and on for now. 
I guess I just haven't gotten back in the groove of my writing again yet.
Soon I will have my shit back together and my head on straight and something interesting and poetic to say....until then."

"event","So since I used to use this journal things have changed, a lot. I live in the middle of nowhere out in Wayne County..Pikeville, NC to be exact. I live with my boyfriend of two years. Yes, if you glance through some old entries of mine you are probably just as shocked as me about a relationship lasting two years...especially living with the man for two years. Well, things are stressful like always. My boyfriend is fifteen years my senior. I love him dearly but things are definitely rough. We are at two different points in our lives, as most people would imagine since we have such an age difference. We've known each other for a while..funny story actually. I met him through a band in which he used to play with and I was at first messing with the singer. Sounds terrible I know. But, the singer and I were hanging out from time to time and I thought it was going to maybe progress into something more but then I find out the bastard was married with children! Yes, so amazing, a man who lies to get in a girl's pants. Anyway, we obviously stopped talking but we did remain somewhat friends and he introduced me to my boyfriend. Things were amazing for about the first year but afterwards things got and continue to get worse. 

I hate how when a relationship starts or you figure out you like someone you do everything you can to show how much you care and you try to impress that person any way you can. After you develop real feelings for the person they show who they really are...they start to do whatever makes them happy and could care less how it makes you feel. When they start acting like the real them most of us stick around..for different reasons I guess. My reason is complicated. I am a hopeless romantic. I also have this bad habit of rationalizing things and making excuses for things I really shouldn't put up with. I work full time at a car dealership doing accounting and only make $10 an hour. I have a $343 car payment and my car insurance is $200 a month...yes, I got a DWI last year and now am paying out the ass for insurance...my cell phone bill is never less than $90 a month and I am negative in two different bank accounts. I feel as though I will never get out of this money slump. I do not pay any of the household bills or rent towards our house payment. This sounds like I leech off of him. BUT, I would rather pay half of the bills around here than put up with the abuse I have to endure living here. I hate how reliant I am on him. I do not want to be dependent on anyone. I feel like such a loser being so in debt. I am going back to school. Well, that's the plan. I have to register for the math class I have to take on August 14th and classes start on the 18th. That is the only class I can take this semester since I am planning on applying to the Dental Assisting program in April. I need this class to be able to apply for the program and this is the last semester before the application process begins for the program. I'm not sure how much the class is going to cost or the book yet but it can't be too expensive for just one class! I hope not. 
Anyway, the Dental Assisting program is one fall, spring and summer term and then it's over. Starting out pay is about $20 an hour and most dental offices only work 4 days a week. I should be ok with money by then. I want to take a loan out large enough for me to pay for school and my living expenses since just the first semester alone is 21 credit hours and it would be impossible to work full time and go to school. This would be great so that I could move out on my own.
Here's my life in a nutshell:
I wake up go to work for 8 hours or more where I make nowhere near enough money to make a dent in my bills.
I come home...
walk in the door and he starts in on me to go work out. ""Why are you so lazy. You need to go work out and stop sitting on your ass.""
we argue some more. He calls me some name usually with fat in front of it or some form of it.
I cry. 
I reluctantly go upstairs and work out. Kill myself working out so that I can feel even more disgusting because another day goes by without losing any weight. 
I come downstairs and clean a bit, cook dinner.
I take a shower smoke some cigarettes and go to bed.
I crawl in bed with the ceiling fan on because it gets too hot in there without to me. 
""Lose some weight and it won't be so fucking hot."" is what I hear when I beg him to leave the fan on so I can get some sleep.
I cry myself to sleep.
Wake up late.
Start all over.
Can't go anywhere because I am broke all the time. Can't go anywhere because I can't drive except to work and home with my limited driving privilege license due to the DWI. 
Things aren't real good. 

Don't get me wrong some days are good. Sometimes he looks at me like he still cares. But it has been months since we have had sex. It has been so long since he's touched me like he actually loves me still. It kills me to be around him. Instead of anything to impress me, it is anything to annoy or piss me off. But I'm a bitch, a fat bitch at that. 

I like a boy at work. We are always together. It started out slow. We spoke sometimes when we happened to be outside smoking at the same time. Then we started getting each other to go smoke together. Now he has the nickname Muffin and everyone thinks there is something going on. We talk about everything. He knows my situation. We had this work function and it was my time to hang out with him outside of work so I went. I fought with my boyfriend and stayed at my friend Kim's apartment. Work boy and I exchanged phone numbers at the work thing and then after we left we texted each other....he came and picked me up from Kim's. We and our 3rd partner from work who is always with us all went to the pool hall then we and some other friends of theirs went to a nasty strip club, ridiculously fun shockingly. We went to our friend from work's apartment and hung out with his wife and 2 of his step children and drank some more and then he drove me back to Kim's, it was 6am when I got back. Nothing inappropriate happened. It was the most fun I have had in a very long time. 
We haven't hung out with him outside of work since then obviously since I am in a relationship and he can't know about us hanging out...I feel guilty even though nothing happened. Anyway, he doesn't like me as more than a friend I don't think. He gives me such mixed signals. I'm pretty sure I'm completely not his type. I don't know if I'm anyone's type. 
He has my self esteem so fucked up worse than it ever was. UGH.
I'm sick of this already. I can't get my thoughts out like I am having them. Everything is all mixed up in my head. I'll write something worth a shit after I get myself together."

I have been seeing a guy for the past few weeks and as much as I never thought I would ever want to get married or have kids...I can see myself having a LIFE with this guy. He is amazing and I can't get over how he treats me or how he makes me feel. I also got a new job finally after losing my last one for missing too many days, since I was living with psycho bitch and she kept getting me sick because she was constantly sick! I hate her and hope she dies. Seriously, that girl ain't right in the head. So yeah, I'll be making $10 an hour, a dollar more than I made at the last place and the most I've made at any job. So hopefully I will be able to save up a good amount of money and move back out on my own. It's very depressing to live on your own for so long and then hit hard times and have to move back in with your mother. I'm finally 21 so that's nice...I lost my job a week after I turned 21 so I haven't been able to enjoy it as much as I could if I had money...but the boyfriend and my 2 bestest friends (Amanda and Stephanie) have been amazing and take me out like 5 times a week and pay for me to get plastered. Always fun. All my bands have been awesome about not making me pay (though I rarely did before) too so I'm lucky to have such great friends. August 9th I start my 3 weeks of training for the new job at www.eros-guide.com at the call center. It should be interesting, as always when I'm entering new territory I'm nervous, but I'm sure I'll do fine. I've been really extra emotional lately and I'm not quite sure why. I think I might be PMSing but I have never been this whacked out before. The tiniest things have been making me cry, whether it be happy or sad tears....or a mixture of both since I have been so wacky here. I'm sure I'll be fine, it's just I have a lot going on I guess. Anyway, I just felt the need to write some shit out before I tried to go to sleep, sort of try and clear my head...sweet dreams everyone. xoxo"

the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away

my sweetest friend
everyone i know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt

i wear this crown of shit
upon my liar's chair
full of broken thoughts
i cannot repair
beneath the stains of time
the feelings disappear
you are someone else
i am still right here

my sweetest friend
everyone i know
goes away in the end

Heather Viens is going with me to South Carolina to see my baby's band and Isabelle's Gift play at Headliners...atleast she said she'd go...I couldn't find anyone to go and I asked her thinking she'd say she had to work like everyone else but she said she could go!

I'm ""seeing"" Mark, the bass player for Automag. Well, we aren't exactly ""seeing"" each other. We are doing something, we just aren't exactly sure what that is yet. We care about each other and that's all that matters right now. Things have been good I guess. All I've been doing is working and going to shows and hanging out at the practice space with they guys. (MagnetHead, Age Of Despair, and of course Automag) Jessica and I went to Fayetteville saturday night and saw Motograter and Dope! It was an awesome show. All the Motograter guys are great, always so nice. Their second drummer (the one I was so excited to see) missed the show though, he had a baby...well his wife or girlfriend or whatever had one! lol So I forgive him for missing it. I've made a few decisions these last few weeks and I'm excited to see that I may actually make something of myself. I am working on doing things by myself and not depending on other people. I have so many good ideas but I always feel I need someone to help me and to be there with me to do it...well I realize that I am the only one who can make my ideas come to life. 


November 19---Jester's Pub, Fayetteville, NC----
This will be one of the saddest nights ever. This is Twan's last night playing in MagnetHead. I support him in his decision, I just wish there was a better way. He is leaving to concentrate on school so he can finally finish...I hope he achieves everything he has ever wanted to...god knows he is/was in the best band ever. :*( I'm going to have to get the club to allow me to take my camera in though, because they don't allow them...but I will not miss taking pictures of his last show..hell no"

I have always lived through other people. yeah, i said it. I have my own dreams and ideas and everything..but instead of going and doing what i want to do or trying to get somewhere on my own i try to cling to people who are where i want to be...or like i want to be. i see someone who is cool and i want to be friends with them and its stupid. i am going to become me. i want someone to see me and decided they want to know me, not the other way around. i just finished reading the rules of attraction. i loved it. yeah maybe im stupid for liking it? but it really made me think and it made me realize a lot about the way i am. along with all the terrible things that have happened lately. whenever i feel like something is the whole world to me or even someone it all comes crashing down and i feel like i could just die. i dont understand how i can take things so seriously but not take them seriously at the same time. this shit going on...yeah i wanted to kill my fucking self over it...really i did, and if i wasnt so big of a pussy i would..down a damn bottle of pills with a beer or something i dont know...but then i would sit and think about everything i would miss out on if i did and how much it would kill my mother and how much i love my mother and want nothing more than to make her proud of me, which is why i have decided to take that part time job with chris and go back to school and try real hard to get the fuck out of here. 

i cleaned my room today. it looks pretty nice actually and i did my laundry which is amazing. im starting a new book tonight too. the dharma bums by jack kerouack. i hope its good. im sure ill like it. i keep starting to write this story i want to tell but i cant seem to get it out right. and i end up erasing everything and being depressed about how shitty it all was. ive been watching cold mountain a lot and it makes me sad but in the happy sad kind of want to feel that depressed way. i cant explain it. i feel so weird lately and all i want is something new to happen. i think tomorrow ill go back to the gym finally and ill go to starbucks and read. i dont know yet. i was supposed to go pick brandon up in wilson but i havent heard from him and i dont know if im still having to do that. im hoping so because i really could use the money for gas and i wouldnt mind talking to him about the shit that has been going on lately. man i dont think i have wrote a ""real"" post in forever. and now im done"

"event","i'm sitting up here at r&r. its braden's day alone, well rocky is here, but he is the only tattoo artist today. i'm so pissed off..his wife came in here the other day and saw my ""michelle loves you"" sign he had hung on his mirror in his room and made him take it down and gave him a bunch of shit about me and him. i mean i dont blame her...but still. i hate this. i hate having to pretend i dont want anything to happen between us when thats all i want. i hope he doesnt walk over here and see me typing this, that would fucking suck. oh well. he is cleaning his tubes right now so he probably wont come over here. i went to leave and he told me to stay...i dont know why he wants me to stay...he hasn't been acting as though he is happy to see me lately. i dont know. we got into a conversation about my father. he said that when he did my dad's tattoo he told him the whole story with our family..how he left and me and wendy hadnt talked to him...and how i just started talking to him recently. we discussed this shit for a while and nothing was really resolved. i didn't really say much because i didnt want to get too emotional. i wish i wouldve been here when my dad got his tattoo...i wouldve heard everything that was said..but no, now i dont know exactly what all was said between them about me or anything at all..and it pisses me off. i'm depressed now and i dont want to be up here for much longer...i dont know why he asked me to stay. god damnit i dont know why i fucking love him like i do but it is killing me and i wish it would just end all ready. i keep trying not to not to cry but its not working too well....rocky just asked me why i look all teary eyed. i told him i had just yawned. im a bad liar."

"event","ok so he gave me a hug good bye like always as we depart, but he once again (second time) acted like he was going to kiss me, but this time he actually puckered his lips and went towards me...i shoved him and said stop you retard! why he keeps playing with me i dont know. it is killing me. i may be working on tuesdays with him, those are his days alone. it would be me and him all alone all day long. oh god. i'd die. there is noway we could be together that much and nothing happen with us. married or not. i love him"

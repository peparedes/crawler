"event","It seems that most of my friends left before me, so this time I didn't feel so left out.  I'm glad that all my friends are going to college, they'll be free when I am when I come home from college and they are also done with the silly high school things.  Prom, college applications, graduation, all done, for us all.  
Friday night before leaving there was no one to hang out with so I decided that I should take a trip to Worcester to see Sara.  It was a lot of fun and I will definitely have to go back up sometime to visit her.  She left for school less than 2 weeks prior but I was shocked by the amount of friends she had and how close they all seemed to be.  I'm glad she's really happy there.  I just hope that all my home friends don't forget who they grew up with :-)
Saturday was spent with Scott at a beachtown where we sat on the rocks for a while, walked by some stores and got ice cream.  Came home and had a wonderful dinner with a romantic set up thanx to my mom, haha.  She put a candle out with dim lights for us, cute...  Gave him his birthday gifts and my parents bought cake for him.   We watched Seven cuz I gave him that movie.  Tried to get coffee but Colombo's is always fucking closed!   At least when we go...they closed a little early :-(.  It was a sad goodbye....
Sunday morning I moved in but was so tired!  We just dropped everything off in my room.  By the way, I LOVE MY ROOM.  It's so big and spacious.  I set up a cute little table in the middle of the room with candy in a little bowl and fake flowers set up next to it.  The window sill is big enough to put plants on.  I have my own little space with a lofted bed and I love all  my decorations.  WE HAVE AN ARM CHAIR.... and AC.  I love AC, I sleep right next to the vent and wake up freezing, it's sooo wonderful.  I live on the top of a hill, it's not too bad because it gives me exercise, no late freshman 15 for me.
A week of classes has passed, i'm on top of all my work and have worked some hours at the lab too, don't want to fall behind and I wanna actually earn money and experience this year.  My boss is awesome and actually put me on a research project.   It's gunna put me ahed of the other people in my major.  So happy.
It's the weekend, Thursday night we went to see east campus again and I saw the people who live in my room.  Kinda miss Hicks, but I really do love it here.  Saw the old RA Thursday and Friday, we all miss Brenda.  Our current RA kinda sucks.  

By the way, I am in Hanson's new video for Lost Without Each other

43 seconds into it the camera stops on me and another girl for just a second then moves over to Taylor.  

I'm out."

"event","It's time to say goodbye for a few months to all my friends and watch them all go off to college.  This week I've been running around trying to make sure that my last week is incredible, and it has been.  Monday I didn't do much because i'm stupid and blew off Scott and ended up with nothing to do.  Tuesday plans got changed around, Scott stopped by because he had a one day job that was close by and on his way home was my exit.  It made me incredibly happy to see him for just a half hour or so.  He called me and said he was outside, I love surprises.  He left and I went out to lunch with Carolyn and then we walked around the lake.  Carolyn and I talked the way we used to, openly about anything and everything that was on our minds.  God I miss those discussions with her, but it was so comforting to know that we could not see each other for so long and then go right back to the way we were.  Later that night, I decided I needed to get out of the house after my father made an embarassing comment to me and I went over Scott's.  
Wednesday was filled with fun activities like going to the beach with Jenn and Lauren, going out to dinner with family and going over Carolyn's house.  At dinner we met my cousin and his girlfriend who we all know he's going to end up marrying, wow, I haven't see him in forever and he's sooo nice.  At Carolyn's house I said goodbye to her and I won't see her again until Thanksgiving, but the good news is that UConn gives us a full week from classes, yay!  Unfortunately, most people don't have a full week so I might have to drive around to see people.  
Yesterday Scott and I planned to go to the mall so I could help him look for clothes, not that he needs help.  We wandered around malls for about 6 hours, but it was fun.  He decided to tell me that he changed his mind about the cologne he said he liked, not knowing I got him that cologne for his birthday.  That's alright cuz we had a really fun time choosing a new one together.  At night we saw a really messed up movie, I forget what it was called but it was creepy as fuck.  The idea of the movie was that they cloned a little boy after he died, the family moved far away so that the old town wouldnt' suspect anything.  When the boy reached the age of his death he started acting very weird...and extremely creepy.  It wasn't bad, it kept me amused but crept me out when I went to bed.

On the agenda for today, laundry, packing, return movie, find someone to hang out with."

"event","So Friday was my last day of work...HELL YEAH! My grandfather decided he wanted to take us out to breakfast tomorrow morning, luckily my father didn't really want to go and cancelled, though he blamed it on me and Matt.  I'm so excited about not having work because I feel so bad that I didn't see friends nearly as much as I would have liked to this summer.  You always feel like summer lasts so long and you have all the time in the world, but it never works out that way.  I really don't want to separate myself from them.  Now everyone is leaving for school... 
I saw Becca, Willams and some other people the other night when we went candlepin bowling and I got a 51, pretty pathetic.  I'm good at 10 pin though, I swear!!! So why must I suck so much at candlepin?  Ah well, that's life.  I wasn't in last place though, someone else got a 30.  As long as we all suck then it's okay.  After bowling they decided to kidnap a friend of theirs for an hour or so and drove to his girlfriend's house and just hung out outside for a while, it was pretty dull because I was tired as hell.  Got back around midnight and then went to work the next day.  Work wasn't too bad cuz Fitzy joined me and we actually had stuff to do.  I skipped out early the day before because there was seriously NOTHING to do.
Last night I spent with Scott and we were up to our usual activity, watching Family Guy, it never gets old.  ""He...he..he...hey, when you pull your car into your garage, does it ever say back 'is it in yet?'""  Hahaha.'""
Today I went to the mall and I got myself some new clothes on sale, including a denim skirt which shocked my mother.   I also got some gifts for Scott's 21st birthday next week.  Tonight I hung out with Michelle again and we went to Richardsons for icecream.  I got chocolate peanut butter and got 2 GIANT balls of peanut butter in it, you don't even undersatnd...oh man.  We came back and relaxed for a little, wathed America's Funniest Home Videos while we waited for Carolyn to come over.  Michelle left shortly after Carolyn came and we put in Edward Scissorhands.  Good movie, but I fell asleep.  I think my sleeping pattern will never be back to normal, I really want to be able to stay up late but I keep getting tired SO early!  Carolyn and Michelle both gave me belated birthday gifts, I was happy.  I got a star-light thing from Carolyn that was cool and some Bath and Body works stuff from Michelle, ooooh la la.

A little stressed because I still have to sign up for another class that I couldn't get into and I hope I don't have scheduling problems and end up screwing up my awesome schedule, yikes.  I'm ready to go back, but I'm never ready to leave the awesome people that I know at home."

"event","...with the acception of going back to work.  Monday and Tuesday weren't TOO bad because there was actually stuff to do and Fitzy was with me, makes the time go by faster.  Wednesday I had off and today I was ready to kill myself because there was nothing to do and I had to be there alone for a whole 7 hours...except I went home at 12 because I got out of it, since I had ""stuff to do at home"" ;-).  Hey, my grandfather admit that there was not really much to do.  I think tomorrow he might actually need me and Fitzy might come in, YAY! Let's pray for a quick day.

Monday night Scott was supposed to come home and I wasn't sure what time, around 7 PM I was like ""fuck it"" because I didn't want to spend the night alone.   So I called Michelle and we had a good time together and watched 50 first dates.  I don't know how I feel about that movie, it's kinda depressing but supposed to be happy.  The point of the movie is that the girl had damaged part of her brain and couldn't remember anything after her accident.  I don't think I could deal with being with someone like that.  

Tuesday night I finally got to see Scott, I cannot describe how happy that made me.  Plus I broke curfew, by a lot...my parents knew and kept asking me in the morning what time I got home at.  Since I got Wednesday off I spent the day with him and we just lounged around, it was a lazy summer day.   I wanted to go out to coffee with Scharr and possibly Carolyn and Luddy before he left for school but I ended up falling asleep really early.   I feel bad, i'm going to miss Scharr.  But...good old karma comes around again because I was supposed to do something with Carolyn but she ditched me.  hmph.  Oh well, hopefully I can get in touch with Becca so we can do something tonight.   So sad how people are starting to leave for school again.  sucks."

"event","Back from Germany.  Wow.  Nothing too exciting that I can remember before Germany, just saying goodbye before my trip.  My birthday wasn't too eventful, visit Youth Group for a little, saw Sara, Carolyn and Scott.  Went out to eat with the family.   

So, Germany.  The plane there we had separate seats so we asked to sit next to each other, they said the flight was booked but then he managed to get us seats next to each other.  The seats we got you can't buy because it's actually the rest area for the flight attendants.  We had this little compartment with a curtain to ourselves, 4 windows of space (more than first class), full reclining seats and a nice footrest.  It was...amazing.  We got to see Paris for about 2 hours.  We saw Notre Dame in passing and ate at a resturant called Les (?) Quasimodo.  
The plane ride back we got seats in the front row of economy class, which meant more space than the seats behind us but it could not possibly live up to the seats we had on our other plane ride.  Plus taking 3 flights in one day SUCKS.
I saw lots and lots and lots of churches in Germany, about 15 or 20, no lie.  Silly Dominik and his churches.  We also went on a hike, saw a cave, saw a castle, went to Munich and a few other ""cities"".  Where Dominik and Christian live, Reading would be considered a city.  Munich is beautiful, they have an amazing city hall building, definitely my favorite building.  Germans like to eat lots of meat, beer, bread, butter, cheese and chocolate.  Haha.  They're all thin too.  Sausage, cheese and bread is an acceptable meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Dominik and Christian payed for me and Matt, they were awesome and I will miss both of them and their families.  I took Dominik's family out to eat as a thankyou, though I cannot thank them enough.  His mother did my laundry practically everyday and ironed it plus always had breakfast ready for us when we woke up.  His family is sooooo nice.   I felt bad leaving them, Dominik and Christian were so sad, but it won't be the last time we see them.  It's their turn to come back to America. ;-)

When I got back I went to Sara's goodbye party.  About 9 PM I went home to go to sleep.  You'd think I'd be more tired after only 4 hours of sleep the night before, being awake for a full 24 hours, with 18 of those hours being the time it took to travel back home (without any sleep.)  I ended up waking up at 4 AM and staying up for about an hour.  Now at 11 AM i'm a little tired b ut I must get ready to see Sara before she leaves for school."

"event","Wow, so recently work has been going around my schedule.  I last worked on Thursday and Fitzy came with me which made it much more bareable having some company.  Friday I got the day off because my aunt came here from California and spent the day with my grandfather.  I spent the day doing chores like cleaning my room since my aunt was staying in it and packing for camping.  Then we met some family for dinner at a chinese place.  My grandfather's ""girlfriend"" was being a bitch, as normal, especially to my mom, which really pissed me off.  Apparently she was really mean to my brother at a family party and now the whole family is ready to tell my grandfather that either he comes alone to family things or he doesn't come at all.   Yes, she sucks that bad.  So after dinner Scott came to pick me up to go camping.  We got a little  lost on the way to the cape.

The camping trip was filled with fun times.  I am always designated driver.  We went to the beach at night, ate s'smores (it's not a camping trip w/o s'mores), went to the beach during the day...had fun.  I cooked a couple times, other than that I felt kinda useless.  Everyone kept talking about sex a lot, it was tons of sexual inuendos and everyone jokingly hitting on each other.  Apparently this girl Allison and I really want each other, she kinda reminds me of myself in ways.  Sunday I came home really tired and after a short nap went to pick up Erin in Framingham.  We came back to my house, ate some dinner, figured out plans for the next couple days and then went to get a movie.   We got Mona Lisa Smile.  I fell asleep at the very beginnig (big surprise) but Erin told me that it wasn't that great.  I'll probably end up watching it again anyway.

In the morning my father all of a sudden told me that we had to go to the bank to set up an account for Germany, I felt bad cuz Erin was there and was mad that he all of a sudden sprung this on me.   Shortly after leaving home, my 91 Honda Accord finally hit 100,000 miles.  I was excited, Erin and I wawtched all the numbers change at once, it was insane.  On our way to the cape we got lost around the bridge (it always ends up that way, damn those bridges!).  We also got lost later, apparently mapquest sent us onto this road that doesn't exist, fuck mapquest.  In the Cape we were staying with friends of my family and we asked what there was to do.  So we decided to hang out at Mashpee Commons, it was actually much better than we expected.  Erin and I found these adorable boxers in Gap Body and they were one sale, 2 for $30.  So now Erin and I have matching boxers.  The print of my boxers is the print around the wasitband of hers and vice versa.  

So, the concert.  yes, we went to see Hanson.  We pulled in the parking lot and realized they were parking cars so closely that you couldn't get out til everyone behind you got out.  Aye.  So we forgot about it and went inside and immediately it was so exciting.  This band that I downloaded a couple songs from, Ingram Hill, opened for them.  Quite a nice surprise, they're good.  The next opening band was Ben Jelen who was also pretty good.  The fans were so excited for jsut the opening bands, how often does that happen!?  The entire show was amazing, the energy of everyone made it so amazing.  Not to mention that the boys are way more tallented than they get credit for.  I'm so happy that i'm going to see them on Thursday night as well.  I saw them at a radio show on Tuesday and it was only okay, it's so much better in every way when it's their own concert.  Everything sounds better, they play better, play better songs, make things more interesting, etc.  They played songs from all their albums and it was just amazing.  I love them.  I called Scott after the show just because I was hyped up, he probably thought I was on crack.  

Which leads me to this morning, we got up, ate breakfast and set out on our way to Erin's house.  It took us 3 hours, she drove.  When we finally arrived in Rocky Hill we chilled for a little and ate some lunch then I got the tour of the town.  The tour ended with the Dinosaur State Park, it was actually pretty good.   There were little kids everywhere and then there was us, 2 teenage girls.  We took the time to read everything and actually learn stuff, pretty cool.  This little boy came up to us, he was so cute.   He started pointing up and was like ""dinosaur"" so we talked to him a little.   Then he pointed to his shoe and was like ""I have sneakers!""  Next he points to his mom and is like ""that's my mom"" then he says ""bye"" and waves goodbye to us.  Haha, such a cute little kid.  Can we say ADD?  On both my part and the little kid's, haha.  

After the park I drove home which took me about 2 hours.  Some traffic right before getting home, grrr.  Went out shopping for a bday present for Carolyn which she loved, it was a really cool magnetic dry erase board with tiki faces for magnets.  The marker had a magnet on it so it would stick to the board and the eraser had a string that held it to the board.  So cool.  I also bought a small table for my room and a small vase for some fake flowers and maybe some real flowers if I ever get some while at UConn.  Last year when I got flowers I had to put them in this ugly jar :-(.  I'm determined to have the coolest room next year and make it feel very homey.  I spend too much money.  I wanted to save lots of money.  Oh well.  It's easier said than done.  I then went to youth group where I gave Carolyn her present and hung out.  Apparently I missed my bday cake which Dave brought for me, Carolyn, Sara and Matt Tinney.  Birthdays July 25, 17, 28 and 24, respectively.  And here I am, finally at home...work starts again tomorrow :-( But luckily Fitzy is also coming! yaaay Fitzy!  

Wow this was a LOOOOONG entry...  Soon to come...my birthday and Germany! YESSS! Can't wait."

I'm looking forward to school a little more.  I think this year would have been better if I had a better roomate.  Christina wasn't horrible, I just couldn't connect with her.   Having friends for roomates will be much more fun.  Not to mention I have a feeling that some of the negativity will be done with."

"event","So today I was listening to the radio and ""Sonny Came Home"" was on the radio.  It's a song from 1997, I doubt anyone remembers it, I dont' remember who sang it.  I just remember so many songs from that summer because I listened to the radio so many times so that I could maybe hear mmmbop or where's the love.  There are so many songs that I relate to that summer and when I hear them it reminds me of good times and I instantly feel happy.  Matchbox 20 is another one with ""push"" and Natalie Imbruglia's one hit wonder that i've been hearing a bit of lately.  Isn't it funny how you don't hear a song once for like a couple years then all of a sudden it seems to always be on the radio?  Yes, it's very weird. (hey, it's my journal, I can answer myself if I want to.)


So yesterday I didn't go to work, it was very lazy of me but I felt less than wonderful when I woke up so I called my grandfather and said that i'd work on selling stuff on EBay instead.  My brother's girlfriend (or, ""plaything"" as Scott likes to call her, since they're together every day since the beginning of the summer and he still doesn't call her his girlfriend) also has stuff she wants me to sell for her.  Her Louis Vuitton fake bag and wallet are already at $30 in a little bit over a day, 8 bids already.  Wow, stupid Louis Vuitton and his ugly bags.  But hey, money for me! YAY!  If only everything could sell that well.  Haha, that rhymed.  Scott came over yesterday and I fell asleep for like two hours while he was here.  Oops, I was tired.  He's not boring at all, just comfy :-)

So there has been a change in flights.  Scharr and I now have 7 hours in Paris rather than 6, I want to go out and see Paris cuz it seems like 7 hours is enough time...we'll see.   So yeah, that's all for now.   Tomorrow is Friday which means the weekend is coming.  Weekend=lobster.  Mmm, lobster."

So here I am, once again.  How long has it been since i've last updated? over a week? Yeah, I can't remember that long ago.  Who did I see? what did I do?  No wait! I do remember.   Tuesday, June 29, I went out to dinner with my mom, brother, Pat and Scott.  Later Scott and I went bowling.  First game we tied, aw, how cute.  It was a pretty low score, I think in the 70s.  The next game I beat him by 10 with a score of 110.  It feels good to win.  just kidding.  Wednesday I can't remember. Thursday I went over Scott's and also saw some of his friends where we watched a wonderful baseball game where Jeter flew into a crowd of people while trying to catch a ball.  That's dedication, but couldn't he at least hurt himself in the process?  I can't remember Friday, i'm not sure if I did anything.  Saturday morning I called Scharr to see if he wanted to go to Boston.  We had a lot of fun looking for gifts for the Germans.  We got them both lobster hats and decided to wear them ourselves when leaving the plane, haha.  I think Christian would go along with it, he's a funny guy.  I'm not so sure about Dominik, haha, we'll see.  I'll make him wear it anyway.  After that I went to Sara's house for a bbq but was really really really late and all the food was gone.  It's okay though, I still got some food.  Later we watched some TV and saw trading spaces because Sara is a dork like that and loves the show.  My mom wants them to do a room in our house but unfortunately the rooms in Sara's house are apparently too small for the show.  Screw trading spaces, descrimination against those who can't afford mansions, sue em!  There was also this funny show on that makes fun of celebrities, haha, celebs suck.  

My mind is so scattered.

So, Now we are up to date til July 4.  Scott came over and we went rollerblading around the lake in Wakefield, unfortunately there was a parade going on so it was hard to park our car and we couldn't go all the way around.  At least they blocked off the ugly part of the lake.  Then off to my house for a bbq, I think he didn't like it there very much.  We were seculded from everyone else, not that i think he minded about that.  My family was there and some family friends, first time he ""met"" most of my family and they didn't even talk.  Oh well.  Then off to his friend Murray's house for another bbq.  We went to fireworks in Acton and got eaten my mosquitoes.  Fucking bugs.  Then later that night...some boozin'.  I got drunk.  I was kinda giddy and giggly.  I abused his friend during Asshole.  He had to drink a lot because of me, it was fun :-)  The next morning wasn't so fun.  After I got over my sickness we went out for breakfast and i got harassed for eating just toast and water.  ""Oh my god the butter is going to go straight to your hips""  After that was some spiderman, I fell asleep for part of it, apparently through the best scene.  That night i was tired and went to bed really early.

So...yesterday...  Only 5 hours of work and then to a travel clinc to see if i'm alright to go to Germany.  They offered me a vaccination or whatever for Hep. A but said that it wasn't completely necessary.  My response was ""no thanx.""  If you don't need a shot, then why have it?  Oh and they made me take off my shirt for no reason, perverts.  That night Sara came over to give my parents $ for the clambake this weekend and then we went out for some ice cream.  After that we went to Jesus Christ Superstar rehersal at the church.  I saw Erica, there was an awkward ""hello"" and that's it.  Even if she was there, I was happy to see some other people like Sara and Carolyn.  Laura doesn't go to youth group anymore because she doesn't want to see Erica, I can't blame her.  I also want to patch things up between me and Laura, she kinda lost touch after last summer and the whole incident with Erica.  I'm proud of her now though for realizing what really is important to her.  I love you Laura!  

And tonight is Emily Rand's party.  I don't know if I'll go but she's mentioned it to me.  I'm hanging out with Scott tonight though and he doesn't really like any of my friends that were involved in the ""Erica group"" last summer.  Snow was also invited but I don't think anyone wants to go with him.  We'll see what happens.  Maybe i'll stop by for a little.  Erica will be there, it's just awkward with her now.  Oh well, i'm out."

I forgot most of it, Saturday I forget most of.  Actually, I think I just have a short memory.  Saturday night I went shopping with Carolyn and got some nifty jeans.  I really need jeans seeing as I (now) have only 2 pairs.  My new ones have a red belt, stars on the back pockets and were on sale ;-)  Carolyn was falling asleep on me, everyone falls asleep on me, am I really that boring?  Oh well, yesterday was awesome.  I went to the beach with Scott and he was being a wuss about going in the water.  Apparently I harassed him too much because then he decided to throw me in.  We came to my house, ate dinner and then went to Richardsons for some ice cream.  We got incredibly lost but sang Dashboard while on the road, yay Chris Carraba!  I had so much fun, Scott and I harass each other all the time, haha.  I love my relationship and how it he's become an amazing friend as well as a boyfriend.  :-) :-) :-)  Never a boring time.

At night Becca, Willams and I hung out and played some frisbee.  Then some high schoolers came and started having a water balloon fight where we were, we didn't get hit.   So then we went to the video store and got the movie Secret Window with Johnny Depp, it's really good.  I love suspense.  On the way to the video store my father saw me pull out onto Main Street and he followed my car til I got to One Video and called me over to tell me that I ""flew out on to main street"" and that I ""have a lead foot.""  Funny, because my friends thought I was driving quite well.  Fucking uptight father.  Anyway, i'm over that...grrrr....  But not really, cuz I know I was driving well.

It just means that i'm going to have to be busy twice as much.   Nothing wrong with being social.   So the rest of the plans for today are to take a shower then clean up the room (and maybe the car) and do laundry (which is very much needed). I'm guessing only the clothes will get done though, haha.  Tonight (it all goes well) i'll see Becca before she leaves for Trinity, why does she have to spend so much time there?  I hate when friends go to school for the summer, I miss Rachel too.  Reading is a good place, everyone should want to stay here for the summer :-).  Who knows what we'll end up doing but it's not hard to have a fun time with Becca.  Willams might come too, awesome.  



well, off to take that shower."

"event","OMG I didn't update yesterday! the Livejournal gods will be mad.  I wonder if anyone will read all this nonsense, honestly, who cares about my life?  Does it matter, because this is a journal, therefore it is for me to express my thoughts.  But I can't express my thoughts completely because I know people are reading. I think, in the end, i'm just showing everyone that I suck at writing.  Ah well, c'est la vie.

Yesterday I hung out with Scott, can always count on him for a good time and for lots of laughs :-)  Tonight Michelle and Laura will hopefully come over and we'll eat dinner and swim. I'm pretty excited, haven't seen nearly enough of them recently.  And tomorrow, I don't have to go to work! (hence the good mood)

Off to make food for dinner.  




P.S. mmmmmm, chocolate."

"event","Today all the Hicks Girls (and Chris) met in Providence then we went over to Newport and finally to Becca's house in Somerset, Ma.   In Newport I got some cool hemp things and a pin for a special German ;-).  I haven't been shopping in forever... amazing.  Not really though, cuz i've never been a ""shop-aholic.""  It was great to see everyone though, all the suite-mates!  Unfortunately we didn't get to spend much time in Newport and couldn't go to the beach.  And next time they're all coming to Boston cuz it's a much better city than Providence ;-).

And back to work tomorrow... :-("

"event","So I was thinking that maybe I should join the latest craze and just get myself a journal, it might be fun.  Maybe i'll start to become a better writer after I allow myself to express my daily thoughts...or maybe not. Most likely, i'll just type how I normally talk, like right now ;-).  So, be my friend so we can read each other's journals! yay! Then I can get lots of friends and feel popular.

Tomorrow I get to see my suitemates (and Chris) in Providence.  I'm a little worried about the drive and my tendency to get lost, but if I leave really early and leave myself about...an hour of ""lost time"" then maybe (just maybe), i'll be there on time.  So tomorrow should be exciting.  Unforunately it seems that break is going by wayyyy too fast.  Once mid July hits i'm going to constantly be busy!  concerts, birthday, Germany....then back to school.  Should be full of fun.  I don't know if it can live up to last summer though ;-)"

"event","ARGGGHH.. DAMn BEST BUY....
Preordered Warhammer Online collectors edition ($80) with special in game items and head start access.  Been playing Head Start for couple days now and get email saying your item is backordered and we expect to ship it within 1 - 2 weeks... Needless to say I'm PISSED OFF so I call Best Buy online up and cuss them out.  Now I can't play anymore until I enter a game key. soo pissed right now...  I guess on a good note I already claimed the special ingame items.. so maybe I'll just cancel that order and get the normal edition and keep those special items...  Bah... this sucks."

"event","well... another slow and frustrating day for me... can't understand why business isn't picking up as much as it should.. it was pretty warm outside today ;;

Been getting into WoW more and more recently.. just got BC expansion and 22 Dranei hunter right now.  Hopefully can take it to the cap within the next couple months.  I am eagerly anticipating Warhammer Online.  Already preordered collectors box edition of the game when it comes out.  Can't WAIT...

these 13 hour days are killer on me but I hope they pan out into a money paved road to riches :)
that's all for now.. got some ice to sell  :P"

"event","Ok.. been a long time since updating and I can now say that the store status is.... a little lower than my expectations.  But. Summer is here, and with the 90+ degree weather soon arriving.. business should skyrocket.  I mean, come on, who wouldn't want a huge cup of fat free, cholesterol free Italian Ice on a hot sweltering day?  NO ONE!!
not much is going on with online game time right now.. but I am truly missing FFXI right now.. I'm stuck on WoW at the moment but I am not paying for that so I am ok with it.  It still in NO way compares to FFXI.  Hopefully I can get Sassy back, but.. I'm getting worried about them deleting her completely.  That would be a serious blow to me.  Well, anyway that's all for now.  I 've got more time on my hands and I keep telling myself to keep everyone who cares updated.  For now.  Take care :)"

so soon and im back to where i started, back in brisbane alone. lost and sad. it would be easy to just let the waves push me over the edge, let my body bob on the surface to and fro. i  have to use all my effort to hold on through this storm as i have more to do"

stepped on a rusty nail last night, been back in brisbane two days with kathrin, we were in childers picking tomoates then down byron lismore way looking for more work and went to a mullum doof.
scored a job at uber washing dishes. its not too bad but it could be better, did one shift and then stepped on the rusty nail and now i cant even move my toes. fucking hell. but its all good kathrin is going to do all my shifts for me until i can walk again.
very very broke, sitting at bys in brisbane waiting to see a doctor, waiting , waiting in pain, need painkillers but have no money.

but i will look forward and try not to dwell in the shit day i am being put through. cant wait to get over to germany for summer, crazy germans and massive festivals, fuckyeah. probably making pizza in an italian restraunt.

"event","well everything that seems to disposition itself from time to time in my life seems to also slide back into place again.
ive been fretting for the last few days as i told kathrin she could come and stay with me when i got back, before i asked john my landlord about it. then when i asked him about it, he said no. and i have spent the past 3 days fretting about what to do and whats going on. and just when i thought id never find a solution to my problem. one little text message solves it all. a message from brownyn's little sister emily asking if i want to move in with her into a unit on the backstreets of innerish cairns. shes more than happy kathrin come and stay as it makes the rent cheaper, and theres a double bed in the room already. beats the hell out of the single im sleeping on at johns place.
i swear that evil single bed is the single root of all my sleepless nights. its on wheels you see, so you push it into the corner but you cant lean against the walls because the bed will just slide out from under you and leave you on the floor. i hate it but theres nothing i can do. a couple times during random nights ive slid down inbetween the wall and the bed and woken up jammed between a bed and a hard wall. freaks me out allright.
haha kathrin has to come back on a boat from the island, a 3 day boat ride, shes going to hate it. she leaves wednesday and makes it back into cairns friday or saturday night. yay ill be working. but ill meet her wherever and take her back to the dig to dump her gear.
well i have 25 mins before work id better head off and start getting ready for a glorious shift at work.

"event","wow these past days have dragged on and on. i havnt been to work for 5 days because i ripped cartalage in my knee at the skate park on saturday night, that put me out of work for two days, then when i went to go back to work the restraunt was closed because the 6 story building ubove us was 'becoming unstable' and engineers ruled it too unstable to have people working underneath it. it was front page news, two days after the incident happened. so villa has been closed for the last two days but i have work tonight thank god. my pay cheque next week is looking thin. 
i proposed to kathrin a couple days ago in an email to let me come away travelling with her. ive sat down and figured out i can afford it, but ill have to pull some strings to make it happen.
oh i miss her and i want her to come back to cairns and off that stinking island, its driving both of us insane. and i just want to get an email from her saying , yes come travelling with me for the summer. that would be awsome. so im sitting in a cairns internet terminal and its stinking. and its not even summer here yet and all i want to do, is gather all my gear and take off south for the summer with katrin and try and escape the heat."

all i know is the next 4 weeks are going to drag on like no other, i cant make them go any faster, its taking its own pace. it would be better if i could call her and hear her voice but there are no phones to reach her on and her mobile is out of range. come back kathrin! im bored without you. tomorrow is get a fucking job day, yeah! and im going to get a day job, fulltime and save my  money or atleast this is the plan. i just need to take my mind of kathrin, but it very rarely works. i just take my mind off everything else leaving more time to think of kathrin. i got an email from her today saying shes still wearing a particular pair of shorts i slept in before she left and she still hasnt washed them, so im going to send her a dirty tshirt so she can wash those fucking shorts. and maybe a letter explaining the dirty t shirt. heheh."

before kuranda fest i was in town getting drunk after a job trial and going to frequency fridays! but i left shortly after i arrived as i had no drugs, money and kathrin was on my mind more than the beats were. lately ive been a shadow of my former self, quiet and closed these days, no intrest in whats going on around me. no intrest in being social or partying. no intrest in anything at all. just a constant pain at the bottom of my heart where kathrin left her mark and walked away. i am too impaitent for this waiting game, 4 more weeks to go, sounds like a year to me.

"event","i wake up one saturday morning about a two weeks ago in a backpackers in cairns. the story of how i got there blurry but still quite fresh. after a friday night celebraiting my friends 18th birthday i checked into the backpackers at about 1 am after i realised i was too tripping to go home. i paid up and collected my sheets and key and went up to my assigned dorm. shoprtly after fighting a war to get the sheets on my bed i coma'd out for the night. 
only to awake the next morning wondering where i am, i open my eyes but dont move a muscle for about two minutes contemplaiting my next move, i foucus on the bed next to me to see another woman asleep still. i sit up to take a better look. I didnt know her yet, but as soon as i saw her lying there i knew that i would never be able to know her enough to satisfy the sudden lustful urge i felt. somthing i had not felt in close to 6 months. so i lay back down on my bed closed my eyes and laid next to her in my head. as i was day dreaming away i heard the woman get up and go to the bathroom. so i sat up waiting for her to come out. we exchange hello's, and i start thinking about the rest of my day. like how im going to get home and if im still tripping at all. i get up, put my pants on and start packing my things back into my bag. i see the nameless girl reach for a cigarette and walk outside. i ask her for a cigarette, she gives me one and we stand on the balcony debaiting the importance of a morning cigarette. we finally exchange names, hers is Kathrin, mine is Mais. she asks me if i can get any weed, i say give me 20 mins to an hour. i finish my cigarette and walk downstairs without my bag, pay for another night in the backpackers and walk over to britts house to find some weed. no one was home or awake so i went back to kathrins room. we spent the whole day sitting around playing cards, chess or poker dice. and smoking joints smothing i had not done in a long time. 
i knew i had a big crush on her, slightly shorter than me, dirty blonde long ringletted hair, deep brown eyes, tanned skin, german accent. and i knew that there was somthing more in her eyes when she looked at me. i was captivaited by her, by her pouted smile, her stare. but as usual i knew i was only ever going to look and i would never make the move to show my intrests, as that would mean possibly facing rejection which is a hard thing to face after a night of LSD tripping. so i stayed another night and we talked and talked and never left eachothers side. the next morning i left early to go to work. i got her number and called her later that week for a joint. we had a joint and started playing hackeysac, then walked down the road to the cairns high school field to play soccer. running circles around her with the soccer ball i could read the look in her eye of, oh my god you can play soccer.
we then went over to britts house and sat and watched a movie. then after work on friday i went to britts house with a box of nos but no one wanted any so i downed 10 and started playing with my new mb phone, realised i had kathrins number so i called her and then headed over to the beachhosue for drinks, downed a litre of red wine and started on a jug of beer when we both decided we wanted some weed, so we stole the jug and glasses and walked to britts to pick up. we were going to go out but i got too drunk, then got stoned and passed out on the couch. i awoke the next morning with the mother hangerover, went to the shop and got foor to eat, smoked a kone and msg'd kathrin to see when she wanted to go riding in the rainforest today. then i walked over to the beach house backpackers where she was staying and we got our shit together and got on a bus out to the beaches. grabbed the bikes and headed for the tracks. we got so muddy and had heaps of fun. german girl comes to carins and hasnt been out of the city the whole time she was there and is leaving tomorrow morning for a job for 5 weeks. at this point i still had a mad crush on her but knew nothing would ever come of it as i found out she has a boyfriend of 4 years. after the ride we got back to my house and swam inthe pool and listened to jack jonson, i managed to convince her to take half a mr incredible with me. and as we were starting to come up. my parents came home. so we left shortly after that starting to feel the acid. we waiting and waited for a bus and finally one arrived, kath had lots of energy and was all smiles but i could still feel my hangover from yesterday morning, so i laid down on her lap and closed me eyes. she started to stroke my hair and arms and then we ended up holding hands but i thought nothing of it as we were both in the midst of half a trip each and it was her first one. we got off the other end and went back up to her dorm and sat on the balcony where we first met and smoked cigarettes, then she leaned over and kissed me. and i melted into the floor and a giant wave of warmth filled me from my lips. i could feel he licking my lips but that was all i could feel. after almost falling backwards and regained my strangth and kissed her back. i couldnt believe that she kissed me. basicly from that kiss at about 8pm till 6 am the next morning we didnt stop kissing. we had the dorm to ourselves to do as we pleased, and as we pleased we did. until the other girls came back and we had to keep and quiet and on a single bed. the whole night neither of us slept we just lay side by side in eachothers arms, lapping up the warmth the other was projecting. and it wasnt in the morning that i realised that after a week and somthing of lusting after her, she kisses me, we have one awsome night, but now i dont see her for well over a month. she left me with a final kiss at 6am ish 29th august 05. shes not coming back until 3rd oct 05. and im left alone, pinching myself wondering if all of this ever ahppened.
i for once let all my gaurds down and let kathrin into my soul, now shes gone but she left somthing behind, stuck in my heart"

"event","oh headfuck, 
why does this happen, slightly amusing now that i know the whole story but oh so confusing being in the thick of it last night. got home from work and tym my flatmate invited me to come to newfarm park for his friends birthday. then i invited nigel because he saw me getting ready and wanted to come. at the party loocy was there, loocy is the woman that nigel is seeing. she been coming round to our hosue all the time so nothing unusual. i pull out some booze and me and tym and nigel start drinking. nigel and loocy went for a walk. when they came back a while later nigel grabbed my hand and asked me to come for a walk with him. we sat down by the waters edge in the dark and he spilled out this whole story about how loocy is convinced that im trying to come between them and im really jelous and this explains why i have been so mean to her. and the story was long and twisted and i just sat there agasp that loocy and nigel and fighting over me, of all people.
basicly im not jelous, i was a bit at first because nigel was always playing with loocy and i had nothing to do. and nigel got really angry at loocy becuase as he explained to me, shes jelous of all the time me and him spend together because we are best friends and we tend to hang around eachother 24/7. that and i have offended loocy quite badly a few times, she thinks i hate her. really shes quite nice, and i dont mind her. but takes offence at very small things. and i am one to say things that will offend and i dont think about it. i have just been myself around her. but every time i open my mouth she gives me dirty looks for the words i say. shes totally high strung, and very jelous. wich makes her a hypocrite becuase ive heard her speels on radical loving, and then she acts like this? loocy you dont know what radical love is, or you are still trying to wrap your head around your own opinions. 
so yeah basicly loocy hates me now, because in the park when nigel dragged me off to talk to me, he dragged me right in. because to loocy and everyone else it looks like ive taken nigel away and talked to him, and when we went back to the rest of the gathering, i decided i wanted to go home. so i told nigel i was going and asked if me was coming. he said he was going home with loocy, fair enough i then walked to the bus to check the time and ended up coming back because there was 40mis until the next bus. so i sat down and nigel came over from talking with loocy and told me he wanted to come home on the bus with me. so im like whatever you want to do. so i started to walk towards the bus and nigel followed.
basicly the whole night looks like i went there and caused a riff between them and then took nigel back home with me on the bus. 
but really, i had no idea about the shitfights nigel and loocy have been having about me, and as forthe sabotage and jelously thing. when nigel and loocy are together around me i leave them alone. i usually go sit in my room or go to a mates place to give them privacy. i had no problem with it. but now i do because im screwed. loocy is going to go around and tell people that i ruined this wonderful thing they had, whereas infact if people actually knew, she ruined it with her hystrics over mine and nigels relationship.

so yeah, ive kept my best friend but i think ive now got myself a bad reputation within my social circle for somthing not only did i not do. it was somthing that up until last night when nigel dragged me into it, i did not know what was going on.

so once again, i have been scapegoated by someone, and no one will ever believe my side of the story because they all like loocy. so i give up, fuck everyone who knows me and the people im talking about, (cept nigel) becuase im sick of it. it has happened to me a few times. becuase my best friends are usually guys and their girlfriends get jelous of the time we spend together. happened before, itll happen again. and now i just dont care."

Thalidomide was nicknamed ""chemical shrapnel"" becuase of its mutlaiting effects on the fetus in the womb. 
and then a read about the 2CT family of psychedelics. the 2CT family has 25 different variations on the chemical makeup of the first 2CT (5-dimethoxy-4-methylthiophenethylamine), i learned that 11 of the 25 different variations of 2CT have never been synthesized. so nobody knows what they do. The man responsible for synthesizing 2CT reasearched extensivly and tested the effects of the 2CT family he created. but he abandoned his reasearch on the 2cp family before synthesizing all 25 to return to his research and investigation into the 5 different types of mescaline. 

so yeah im not doing any work but im learning alot about psychoactive substances and thalidomide babies! yay for the internet! well im going home to eat and smoke, then ill be back to read up more about random shite."

my mother accuses me of abusing drugs. and she treats me like some sort of junkie. im fucking sick of it, its my choice and my body. i like taking drugs and i will continue to do so. this is a problem she has as she cant accpet the fact that i use substances. its fucked. becuase i get up every morning, i go to work, i play my part in society but somehow im the untrustable scum of the earth because i take drugs. she reckons if she gave me money i would spend it on drugs. which is crap again. im saving hard at the moment for a van. why on earth would i spend money on expensive drugs?? thats throwing money down the drain if i need a van and im not saving for it. yes i take fucking drugs but thats only some small part of my life. it does not rule my life. it is not what a solely live for and i am not an addict. 

but try telling that to my insane mother. she is actually going insane because shes working herself into a fucking mind soup. she drinks about 40 cans of diet coke every week. shes constantly pumped up on painkillers and anti depressents. shes a walking fucking cocktail. and she accuses me of drug abuse. she has been self medicating since as long as i can remember.
she says that shes a doctor and shes seen it all with drugs. shes just seen the, junkies and the fuckups. she would have never met a wellrounded person who also uses drugs becuase they would never walk into her practice, or admit that to her.
i have seen more than her when it comes to drugs, i have not seen everything, nor would i want to. but ive seen enough to know that what she see's is too much.

so last night for the first time ever i wrote a long and uncensored email to my mother that spelled out what i thought of her and how dare she treat me like somthing im not. i basicly said she was just as much as a user as me, ifnot more becuase she uses to self medicate. i then told her i wanted no more contact with any of the family. and if she tries to call me ill barr it and if she tries to find me ill move. 

im very serious with this as accusations about my so called ""out of control drughabit"" are getting out of control. and its gone on for years and years now. and last night id had enough as i was taking the shit she was saying to me becuase i needed the money she was giving me. then she takes that away and then tells me i will get nothing for my 18th and i snapped because i realised the only reason i was letting her say these things was because i was financially dependent to her.

hard thing now is that i have to try and get to to sign the contrelink forms to delare me indipendent. and if she refuses to sign the forms, then i will be moving on to drastic measures which might take me back up to cairns to force her to sign them so i can forget about my vile family and move onwards and upwards.

at the same time im glad i wrote her the email, i know it will hurt her alot, but she needs to hear it, whether or not she can cope with what ive written is not up to me to worry about. but i still am sad that im cutting off my family and my mother at that when shes starting to lost her marbles faster these days. but there is nothing i can do now except move on."

"event","almost lunchtime, i have half an hour to wait until i can go and do nothing for an hour in the city. but unitl then i shall type away on my lovely livejournal. yesterday i realised its a month and a half until my 18th birthday. i dont know if im going to celebrate it or not. i might just put aside $200 and go to the valley and get really really super drunk like everyone else does on their 18th. But im really not that bothered about turning 18, its not a big thing for me because i do everything now that i want to do. but the good thing is i can get a job behind a bar in a club and earn some cash working nights and get my van quicker. 
but yeah ive beenthinking more and more about my birthday and the thought i keep getting is, 'fuck ive only been alive for 18years, thats a really short time. but it feels like my whole life' and then i realsied my life has only just begun and that really i know nothing. and im a child of this universe.
so ive been spending the last few weeks in my head, just thinking about things that have happened and things that will. not to mention all the things that havnt and wont happen, like going to the olympics or being a firefighter or a druglord. but i have started to think what sort of life i want for myself, and this is the hardest question because there is no one answer. 
but i know what i dont want my life to be. i dont want to be rich and i dont want to be sucessful, because those are both capitalist constructs created as a way of measuring the drive and worth of a worker. my idea of rich would be rich with people around me who all love eachother. my idea of sucessful would be raising kids who wont hate my guts or disrespect me or people around them. and i reckon i can raise kids like that. anyone can but you cant do it with money, if you raise a child with money they will end up hating you. thats what my parents did. they didnot have the time, so they gave me money instead and i grew up as a very demanding and aggressive child.
so in my weeks of musing before my 18th birthday i have made the decision that i will never have lots of money because it is evil and breaks so many things around us. i will have kids, but not for a long time. and im going to spend the next howevermanylongyears until im bored travelling australia and the world insearch of the greatest underground dance party on earth. and i will not stop until i am standing with the dirt between my toes, and a could of dust rising up around me as the dj drops another kick'in beat and i look up towards the sky amidst a sea of sewaty hot, stomping bodies to realise my mecca is my mind the speakers speak my mind"

"event","another average day really, 
woke up, got up, rode to work ripped. but its friday so im semi content today as i get to go home at three. 
im working on this bullshit job at the moment, its a giant group project on designing a festival, you know.. posters, writst bands, logo, concept, signs etc. and the project manager of the group gave me photography. i guess its not so bad as i get to wander over to the riverstage and take photos, so i get out of the office with it. but what makes it bullshit is that they decided on a old style ninja film concept, so i have to take photos of the riverstage then make them look like theyve been drawn in the mid 60's with coloured ink. bastards! some things are just not possible on photoshop. i can do it but it would take so long. so i got in a fight today with shae the project manager and told him what i thought he should do with his ninja theme. then i told him that he's ovbiously got more vision for these photos then i ever will so why dosent he do it instead of bitching at me to do it different. ahh im just in a shitty mood today.
i feel a little sick, but i had a good couple games of pool at lunch. that made me feel a little better, until i had to go to work.

apparently there is a bush doof on tomorrow night out in the sicks somewhere, i might be going but i dont know it depends if my mate gus is driving or not. otherwise im hanging around west end for the festival or im going into the valley for tribal eyes at the shamrock hotel to dance to some psychedelic trance!

but for now i have 50 more minutes to sit my arse through before i get to go home and have a session. yay, i think."

"event","mmm wednesday, ive been through two t-shirts today trying not to smell. but its a bit hard when the temp is more than that of my body. its probably not, but thats how its feels after riding a bike on the road in the sun. waiting for the weekend to arrive, but i have to sit through the rest of today and thrusday which consists to QANTM which i am currently failing. Julian my tracher is trying to encourage me to cram and do the work need to complete the course in 6 weeks. i mean really, i couldnt compltete the work on the day it was due. do you really reckon you can motivate me to do it all in 6 weeks?

so i sit at QANTM every thurday twiddling my thumbs waiting for 5pm so i can go home and get stoned, thats if i show up.

i found new clothes yesterday, well theyre not new, but they look new. in the gutter running down the side of my work i found a new levis' demin jacket in my size and 5 assorted skate t-shirts. i dont usually wear clothes with big brand logos on them but im making an exception for these t shirts as they are my size and comfy. yay.

west end festival this weekend, local band bertha control are playing at 11.30 on west end' state schools' field, locaited on the conrner of jane st and hardgrave rd. rock on down and listen to them play! im planning on getting up late that morning and wandering down the road from my house and checking them out as west end school is 30m from my house.

well right now im sitting at work, typing and thinking about going to the bathroom, i just got back from lunch. i went to the valley to open doors today to see nerida, as usual she was busy. oh well one of these days ill get the help i need, hah hah.

well ive decided to move a motion that i get up and go to the toilet, and because im the only on here i carry that montion and write it in the meeting minutes. and im not the only one moving a motion right now so im going to dash off to the loo.

"event","Well i arrived back in Brisbane last night at 8.30pm. What a trip!

Getting to Cairns, as usual i left everything to the last minute including working out how i was going to get to the airport. So i ended up calling a friend, who gave me the number of her friend who was on the same flight. So he came and picked me up from my house and we drove to the airport, got on teh plane and i waited with my eyes open in a giant air-tight metal tube until we landed in cairns. Yay i made it to cairns, i was so excited that i was about 1200km closer to Audiogasm! My parents pick me up at the airport at 8pm and take me back to their hous where i proceed to get ridicliously drunk with my little brother, bad idea as the next morning i wake with a throbbing head to remember chucking straight vodka shots down my gullet. Oh im so mature! Saturday morning i realise, tonight is the party. Now all i have to do is find out where it is at (secret bush locaition), find out where my drugs are at, find out where my friends are at, and find a way there.
Well it was like i was ment to go to the party, everything fell into place, not without some stressing on my part but in the end everything came through.
at 9pm i left trinity beach and started to hitch hike to jo falls, 75km south of cairns. first car that picked my up was the random drunk dude who i rolled some spliffs for and we had a session, he let me off at the start of the bruce highway. so i waited there thumbing a lift for about 20mins until i big black souped up kingswood pulls over. i jump in and almost shit my daks when the driver turns out to be what looked like the hardest man alive. he was for sure a gangster, the car, the clothes and looks, tats and scars. then he mentions 16 years of crime and sydney and he's living here as an escape, and for a moment i thought id never get out of that car. so how happy was i when he dropped me 4km down the road. then i waited 1hour on the side of the road, to get picked up by a car heading to the party, yaya!
were drivign along and we spot a poliece roadblock, one of the women in the car hands my a condom and says if im carrying anything then ive got about two mins to conceal it or lose it in a search. so i did that. bit umcomfortable, until we stopped at the block and i see dogs and d's swarming over cars. the uncomforttable feeling vanished almost instantly.
yay we get though the police road block and onto the party.
pay our money, park the car and i start walking over to the dancefloor. 
i was almost high on my own chemicals, i had saved the money and made it to the party, waiting ages for this moment, i can now see, hear, and almost touch it infront of me. wondering who will remember me from when i lived up here i stepped onto the dance floor just as soul drops a beat, wait for it.. wait for it.. ahhkickit  
within 10mins im holding 3 brown amsetrdams, i sqallow one, rack one and save one for later. the best e trip ive ever had. 
audiogasm went off with a really good set up, 35k!! euro standard speakers. SUN CONTROL SPECIES LIVE! oh i could go on for days about it. i dance all night until about 6am then i took a break and went back to gregs van to take my last brown A. after that i sat around for a bit waiting until 7am for suncontrol to start his set. 
sunday during the day was a blur, the heat came on and there was no real shade and march flys were eating me alive. i didnt dance much during the day at all as a was scattered to the max, so i just smoked buckets and eventually passed out at midday under a semi trailor as it was the only shade i could find. i awoke close to 4pm and decided to head to teh dance floor and find jess. we left shortly after that and i got home and crashed after a few jays. monday and tuesday were blurry as i was and still am now scattered a bit. 
travelling home was shit, i fell asleep ont eh flight and awoke to teh tyres touching the tarmac at brisbane airport, i then caught an airtrain to roma st and went to find a payphone to call a cab, i found two one witha jammed coinslot so i had to wait half an hour while this euro tourist was calling long distance, and all i wanted to call was a cab. i ended up crying on the side walk because i was tired and scattered and just wanted to go home.

but the trip was awsome, and this is a brief over veiw that misses out alot of detail, because if i was to write in detail about my trip i would be writing a novel. and like thats ever going to happen."

well for all of those millions who flock to my fantastic live journal(insert sarcastic tone somewhere around here), and who live in australia listen up.

END THE LIES- howard out troops out. 

anti howard rallies all around australia in all major cities i think. SEPTEMBER 26 11am roma  st forum, brisbane. bring your angry faces and large voices lets tell john howard where to stick his liberal party. 

for all the info on the brisbane rally and others around australia go to http://www.endthelies.net

yay, ive had enough of howard. fucking liberal scum, the people of australia deserve to live in a society where they dont have to put up with people being locked in cages in the desert because they didnt follow ""legal"" means of entering the country. thats bullshit, people are people and society is fucked. we should be helping these people not locking them away. but john howard thinks its fine to do this. well its not. john howard needs to learn respect for working class australians because at the moment he is showing us none. he scapegoats minoritys, and wriggles his way out of desprate situations with a bullshit press confrence. i want him gone, australia needs him gone. another term of the liberals in power and john howard trigger happy in bed with bush and i think ill sink into a depressive rut.

i know latham isint much better at all, but atm im on an anything but howard mindframe.
this so called ""democratic"" two party system. is bullshit. i have no confidence in it whatsoever being a system that represents the voices and needs of the society that live under this system. 

come october 9 i want to see howard out, and so do so many other countless numbers of people all over the world who have been, screwed over by howard and his liberal party. 

and another thing, why would you call a political party that is conservative as fuck and so far right there almost falling off the wing the liberals?  why? hypocrisy! i tell you

lots has happened in the little world of punkposterchild,i moved house! my new house is great. in a stinky old queenslander rental house sort of way. but hey im not complaining ive got the 2nd biggest room in the stinky house. 
barbie acid tabs floating around brisbane at the moment, are worth picking up if you come across them. i double dropped barbies two weekends ago. they produce heaps of visuals, quite intense, and some halucinations. i dropped them 10am saturday and sat in my back yard painting, as they started to come on i would look at an object and see it being made up of fractals, 100's of tiny fractals all moving in sync to give the impression of a dead still object. 
they are a little bit intense and alot of people and me included have reported a slight saddening effect and crying for no reason. i was drrawing away and put one wrong line on my page and started crying. so i went to the toilet to dry my eyes and sat on the toilet seat. i watched a dripping tap start to fill up the basin sink and flow down the side of the cabinet to a puddle on the floor, i watched the watch slowly fill the bathroom, i could see and feel it climbing up my legs, the water filled the bathroom till over my head, and i was swimming around the bathroom for a while, then i started to panic a little bit so i reached for the door handle and suddenly i was standing two meters from the bathroom door with my back to the bathroom with wet feet. 
i love tripping
so i reccmend barbies, theyre intense and will leave you a little bit scatterd for a whiile after but the comedown is not that harsh. wicked visuals and intense waves, for a while i was watching my friend melt into a tree, then burn infront of me. wicked."

"event","Yes i know i wont learn my lesson, because i sort of knew this would happen. Swim in the Brisbane river, and you WILL get sick.
I feel like crap, but also because i cycled to herston from west end and back to score a cue of ganja, with a sore throat. Its a bit far for my cycling habits these days but i still managed to get there a back with a stop at maccas in between in 35mins. not too shabby! Im still semi fast. But last night's little escipade made this morning's ride to work that little bit harder. It felt like my legs were going to drop off my body and rattle down the street, then the rest of me would career into a semi and 3 seconds later im a 20ft long red smear with bits of bike mixed in would magically appear out the other side.

i feel as if im turning into some vast slug infront of my computer. forever vegitating infront of a cathar ray tube. RGB will be all i see. I sit on the internet for 8hours a day, 7 days a week. So as you can see my journal is always going to have new material in it because its not like i actually do any work anyway. Allthough i am employed as a designer, i only do that sometimes.

What my job actually involves and why its sort of cool:
1. get to work at 9
2. sit on computer for all of the day
3. talk on msn or update livejournal of surf the web for whatever floats my boat
4. i have headphones on all day and dont talk to anyone
5. because i am a smoker i have to go outside to smoke so i take about 25mins a day in 5min smoke breaks, sometimes wanddering over to king george square to sit and have a smoke
6. scooting around the office on chairs, while coming up lyrics and music
7. decorating my monitor and desk with intresting little trinkets
8. hour for lunch head to a bar in the city to play pool
9. back from lunch i make some food and eat it at my computer
10. 5pm i go home
11. some times i cough up an excuse for a design piece when asked. its like learning to bark on command. i am also the master of never doing any work but always looking like i am. but that plan falls short when you have nothing to pass in for deadlines. 
im so fucking bored the world is so round."

Most of us would never admit it, but at one point or another we all have trouble taking a shit. If youre like me and you gotta go and just cant then try this handy tip next time youre a sitting, but you aint shitting.
                             whistle!
I know its crazy but it works really well, just whistle a tune, and if youre in a public loo or you cant whistle just try to without the sound. Purse your lips and the other end seems to loosen up.

Now some of you will be thinking im crazy. Well yes i am but not as crazy as you fuckers straining to take a shit. I whistle to pass the gristle! whey!!"

"event","What a weekend. 
I did nothing, for the whole weekend. Im exhausted from sitting, smoking and drinking. It all started on Thrusday when i got paid, first thing i did was go and buy a 1/4 of ganja and sat at home and smoked myself into a stupor. Promising myself a weekend of no social contact with the outside world, and to properly move into my not so new house. I have been at Rogers St for 1 1/2 months and i still have not moved my bed up from downstairs. I also had to do my laundry, as i have not washed i single item of clothing in 2 months. It has been on my to do list for this weekend but instead i sat around a smoked until i knocked myself out instead. I got as far as the supermarket and brought two boxes of washing powder. That was about all i did as far as washing goes.
I am the most lazy person i have ever met.
Well that was Saturday, on Sunday i went to a queer picnic in New Farm park. I rocked up way to early and way too ripped to handle the heteronormativity going on all around me. So i sat in the corner of the park and smoked jays all arvo until i spotted people i knew. Familys were looking at me funny, my and my jet black mohawk, sitting in the sun rolling up jays. I knew people knew what i was doing, but im not one to care because i know no one is going to have the balls to come up to me and say somthing because people just dont want to get involved. 
Then after i had sat on the riverfront greening out for a while and watching the Citycat's go past for a few hours everyone all rocked up in seprate groups at the same time. Typical queer picnic, fuck all food. Heaps of grog. So we all proceeded to drink ourselves into a drunken mess and familys were moving away quite fast when couples started doing their thing. I had a good time i think but by this point i had been continuliously stoned since Thrusday so everything was pretty glazed over in my head. Drinking goon got my all hyped up and we started playfighting and playing soccer until some idiot kicked the ball into the Brisbane river. So Candice swam and got it. Skull Bitch! Shes was alfuly keen to get into that river, dont know why though. Anyone who lives in Brisbane can tell you stories of things in the Brisbane river. Then later on me and Candice, Nick and Tim all stripped off and took a dip in the river. The rocks were so sharp i have deep cuts on the soles of my feet. I ended up taking a mouthfull of the river, when i was gasping for air because its winter and it was freezing. Its awful brown in colour. All i could think of when i was swimming around was about the people who have been killed by bull sharks from swimming in the river here. We were all bleeding into the river, we all got cuts because the rocks were so sharp but none of us knew because we were too drunk to notice the pain. So yeah im now sick from swimming in the river, i will do it again. That wasnt the first time ive been in there. Allthough last time i jumped off the Victoria Bridge.
Im in the shit. 
I am a sucker for not keeping track of my finances. Especially when i am stoned. I decided i was going to go shopping stoned, and result was spending all my rent money on food. So i have lots a food but no rent money and my rent is due in 5 hours. Im counting down!
But my friend James who is good at saving money is loaning me some cash so i can pay my rent. He's so nice. If he wasnt gay i reckon we'd have some sort of queer thing going on.
Well for those of you who read this, which i imagine is no one. But on the slight chance i have a person reading my diary i will put a little about myself in here. Just this once so people have a vauge idea of who is typing this utter crap onto this online journal.
I will do that next time
Sometime
Whenever"

"event","Yay what a fantastical present from my boss!
Me and my workmates came into work on monday to find the whole office decked out with new carpet, its great. I got all excited and got down on the floor and made snow angels, then the carpet burn started to set in and i stopped.
Im doing a merchindising project at the moment, its not too shabby. It was keeping me busy but one of the servers went down Sunday night and 4/9 computers arent hooked up to the network and wont be for the next few days. Which means i cant get to my work on the server.
Im not that bothered because its not like i really care that much. Ill just sit here and play internet pool and have some fun. Well as much fun as i can have at work.
The only way im on the internet is because another workmate is not here today so im on her puter, so i can get to the network and the internet. But i cant do my merch job because its on the desktop of mine because i started it yesterday arvo when the server was down. Oh well.

Im turning more geek everyday, im reading a book as thick as my arm on web publishing, im going to learn Java-HTML-Javascript-CGI-Stylesheets  but my problem is that i dont have a problem with it, my life over the last year has really dont a complete turnaround.

picture this:
1 year ago i was hopelessly depressed and living with my parents, dropped out of school. using narcotics among other things. going out to doofs every weekend. hated myself, had friends but they didnt know me. and i just needed a change. 
so i moved to brisbane with a bag of clothes and a guitar. 
now im full time working, as a graphic designer for speakout, www.speakout.com.au  going to uni part time, have friends who know me and life is generally not too shabby.
just before i moved i started reading some of karl marx and came across this quote

 it is not consciousness of men that determines their being, but on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness

i took from karl marx's quote and decided to test it. if infact as marx said it is your social being that determines your consciousness. then, if i got out of my social situation and moved to somewhere where i had a better social being then my  
consciousness would change. so i moved away from my parents and all the things that made me so mad and depressed. and things did change.

im pretty happy go lucky and so far it has worked, one day i think itll stop working but until that day ill keep going the way i go. i didnt choose to come to brisbane i threw a dart at a map of AU and it landed on the gold coast. so i picked the nerest capital city from there.

blah blah my boss is coming over i better get to work

have a nice day
Mood- caffineated
Music- requiem for a dream soundtrack"

"event","Why do i slack off at work? Im up to my eyeballs in jobs and well over deadlines, yet im choosing to sit here and create a live journal instead of doing somthing productive. Working as far as im concerned is counter productive. 
I spent last week at Queer Colab, it was fun and blurry. I was drunk most nights and telling my faction where to stick their party line most days. Best thing i did at QC was to tell Bec Baragoss that she was a puppet for Socialist Alternative's master plan. Then i told SA that i was going to leave the faction because i was sick of watching my own faction playing wedge politics with the rest of the left. So now im a free from SA and not wanting to get involved with any organised faction again. Now i want to talk and listen to other people who are not involved in factions and will speak their mind and not just tow the party line."

So I moved again, but this time just down the hall. I'm now in a big room with a girl named Mati.

<lj-cut text=Diary>

Matilda actually, but I guess it's always about nick-names. Not that anyone has ever called me ""Sal"". They had more creative names I guess...

ANYWAY, I have a roommate now!

She's the same girl that I met when Rogue and Piotr were sparring my first full day. Not sure what Rogue's going to think, but I like her. And she can apparently stop time or something like that. She said she gets delusional though, which is a little scary.

And it turns out she's kind of afraid of the dark, which sort of sucks because that means she uses a night-light, which means the room is super bright for me at night. She had a mask thing though, for sleeping and stuff, that she gave to me to use as a mask though, and so far it works ok, though it's been tough to get used to.

She's nice though. And pretty (though a little thin). And super-girly. I mean I though I had a lot of pink, but she's like a pink-explosion!

I think it'll work out though. Neither of us have had roommates before, so we're both learning, and I think she's genuinely nice.

Another new friend! And this time one my age!

Sooooo, the biggest news is that I have a new home. One that's not a hotel room. I finally made it to the ""School For Gifted Students""!

<lj-cut text=Diary>

I ended up with this appointment with Ms. Munroe, who seemed pretty cool, really sort of... elegant? Stately? I don't know, but she seems to have her shit together. Anyway, I ended up with this meeting with her, and I thought it was about the creep in the woods (more on him later!), but it turned out they were offering me a place here.

Kickass! Rarr!

I haven't got a proper room yet, so I've been staying in the guest room, but oooooh wow, it's gorgeous. I don't think I've ever even seen a place like this on TV.It's huuuuge, and according to Rogue has like 8 sub-levels, with all sorts of weird stuff.

Speaking of Rogue, she gave me part of a tour, and we got to talk. Yay! She hadn't heard about the night in the woods yet either, so I told her about that, and she was piiiiiissed.  I thought she was mad at me at first, but she was mad at him. She's pretty sure she knows who he is, and he goes by the name ""Juggernaut"".

I'm noticing everyone seems to have some kind of extra name around here...

Anyway, he's apparently bad. Like killing kittens and puppies bad. She told me he tried to bust open a dam to flood Bayville. CLICHE! But it's true. So I guess I really did get lucky getting away from him.

There are some other people my age around too, which is nice. There is a boy named Chris who seemed nice, and a guy who looks like a gargoyle, who is named Duke I think, but he's married to Amara! She's here too!

Though I guess I knew that already from when we met, Anyway I haven't had a chance to see her yet, but I can't wait. She was really awesome.

There was a girl around my age too, a year or so older maybe, but I didn't have a chance to talk to her. She can stop time. Fucking stop time!!! I heard she's not very good at it though. It was funny to watch when I could see Piotr and Rogue stopped, but really weird when I got caught up in it too. Disconcerting.

It's been weird being around so many kids again, but I'm making myself be social. No one's made fun of me though. Not for being a mutant, not calling me ""Saliva"", no canned tomato jokes... It's like they don't know anything about what Jennifer and all those other kids used to do.

Which I guess is stupid thing to say, since they don't. They'd have no way. I guess in a way I'm waiting for the other foot to drop. Or is it hand... or... I hate it when I fuck up my metaphors.

Anyway, everyone's been really nice, and I really love it here, and not just because there's a TV bigger than I am (though that's pretty cool!). I feel welcomed, and liked.

I get sorta teary just thinking about it... =)

So... catching up from before (I've been too busy and excited to have a chance to write) what else happened:

I ran into Dante in the mall and talked to him (did I tell me about this already?). I even hid us so we could talk without people staring. And I said I was sorry for freaking the first time and being so selfish.

Speaking of freaking (rhyme!) I also ended up running into Lilith. We had a really good talk actually. It was right after the Juggernaut thing, and I was still freaked out. It was the day after actually, if I remember right. 

Anyway, I ran into her at the mall, and she took me somewhere we could talk, and she helped calm me down some and agreed I should tell Rogue and Piotr. It turns out she knows them, and used to be in the same group with them.

She also admitted that she had used her power on me. 

I... sorta flipped out... It's a little hazy, but I think I turned everything off for her, proving it wasn't very funny. I also told her that it really messed with me because I was freaking out about feeling gay, and she felt really sorry. She also said... well... I think mom would call her ""worldly and traveled"" as far as a topic like that. she didn't find the thought freakish though.

ANYWAY... OH! Shoe! Other SHOE to drop. I knew I'd remember!

So I went running out towards the school, and ran into Piotr outside, and we found where Juggernaut had been camping that night (and the trail where he chased me and ran through the trees, and the BOULDER he threw at me), but there was no sign of him anymore. 

Ummm... I'm trying to think of anything else, but I'm super sleepy. Foood coma. Everyone here eats really well, and I'm not used to eating so regularly. I'd tell me if it was any good or not but... I know, haha.

Oh, I hear the school (high-school, not mansion-school) might have a gymnastics team!

That's it for now, little diary! I'm heading to bed. A huuuge, soft, gorgeous bed!

I just made it back, and I'm so terrified. I don't know if I should go to the police, or what.

<lj-cut text=Diary>

I tried to go back to that place where the firework were, where we watched them from, and I got lost. And it was already late. Stupid I know. And then I ended up stuck in the forest, like way stuck.

I thought I was heading the right way, and ran into this guy. He was HUGE! I mean FUCKING HUGE, like Piotr big, but different, more barreled. And he was wearing some kind of... armor or something.

I asked him how to get back, and he told which way to go, and I thought everything was fine. And then out of nowhere he yelled at me and then RIPPED A FUCKING BOULDER OUT OF THE FUCKING GROUND! And then THREW IT AT ME!

A FUCKING BOULDER!

I ran, and he put on some weird hat or something, then started running after me. I was so glad I could see so well, 'cause it's the only way I didn't break an ankle, running in stupid sandals. 

And him? He just ran through the trees. THROUGH the trees!!!

I made it to the road and headed for town, and he stopped following me, but I ran as long as I could before slowing down. I'm so glad I've been running.

I'm shaking, and freaked out, and I don't know what to do. I think tomorrow I'm going to have to talk to Rogue, or Amara, or Piotr, even if I have to show up at the door of that mansion to find them.

Yes, a smell! Aroma! Odor! I haven't been able to smell anything in 2 years, but thanks to my new hero I could!

<lj-cut Text=Diary>

I could smell, and I could hear, and I could taste my mouth, and... I get teary just remembering.

I was out wandering for the 4th, and ended up by the Bayville Conservatory. There were tons of families, and it was a lot like home. A little too much so... I've done really well with not being lonely, but at home when I was alone I was at least surrounded by things and people I knew. Girls like Stacy Harden might have been a bitch, and mean to me, but they could always be counted on to be seen sneaking off to smoke in the park. It was familiar. Sucked big sometimes, but it was familiar.

So, it got a little overwhelming, and I snuck around to behind the building there to just be alone for a few minutes (I'm getting more used to my ""power"", and found a new trick, but more on that later). So I was sitting there and Rogue was out running.

~happy-sigh~

Anyway, we were talking, and I told her about Piotr trying to get me in to visit their school, and she said she would check too. And she said there was this great place to see fireworks that she would show me.

We were talking about this and that though, and I reached up to put a hand on her arm...

So... apparently her ""gift"" involves touching others and ""borrowing"" whatever they do, cause when I woke up she apparently had mine. And I say ""woke up"" because it also knocks you on your ass and puts the lights out for a while.

But when I woke up... She was having some of my troubles with the brightness of light and stuff. And she was talking kinda fast, like I do when I get excited. It gave me an idea though, wondering if I can stop people from seeing me, if I could maybe just dim things for her a bit. Counteract it. 

She had the same idea though, and since she could do what I do, it seems to work, and in good ways too!

So this wonderful, pretty, feisty girl let me see and hear normally for the first time in years, and taste, and smell.

And we were in this little area of woods, so it smelled so green. I had forgotten what green smelled like... fresh, and musty, and wonderful.

And she smelled sweaty from running, but also... I'm not even sure how to describe it, except I guess she smells like Rogue. I can still remember it too... It's sort of a phantom smell (I get them occasionally, and tastes too), but it's such a wonderful memory. 

She said we could do it again sometime if I didn't mind the headache, but the thought really scares me. I mean it could be something really special, but I think it could be addicting... But it would be a way to spend time with her, too...

Which, as I reread what I've written, makes me sound like I'm love-struck (I wonder if anyone else besides my parents use that term). I hope it's just because of what she did for me. I think... life is complicated enough all of a sudden. I don't think it needs to get THAT complicated. And I know the thought of it would probably freak her out, too. I mean it really sorta freaks me out just writing to MYSELF about it.  

Hero-worship! That's it, hero-worship. I just have a new older friend and role-model, I've never had a role-model... Not a live one anyway. Yay! I was sort of getting worried. This is why I love to write things out, it makes it easier to getting your thoughts straight.

I wonder if people with older siblings feel the same way? Though... I doubt it sorta... I don't think people remember how their big-sister smells...

Let's stick with having a new hero...

I know resolutions are supposed to be for New Years, but I guess I'm making one for the 4th of July. A resolution that I will come to terms with becoming a mutant.

<lj-cut Text=Diary>

I talked to Piotr again today. I ran into him while we were both out running. We talked, and I said I was sorry for freaking out on him the last time we were both there.

When we talked though, I found out the gothy girl who convinced me to start running is named Rogue (I know, sort of a weird name considering how nice she was), and ALSO lives at that mansion. He said it was called the ""School for Gifted Youngsters"", which is really ironic I thought; gifted with powers.

I also... tried mine on him... And it worked, which scared the fucking bejesus out of me. I think I've done the invisibility thing a couple times by accident, but I've never completely shut someone off before. He seamed impressed, which considering he said he can turn himself into a steel-person seems like some sort of compliment.

The big thing though is that I asked him if he could show me the school. He was going to try and do it tonight, but it fell through, so maybe tomorrow. I want to do it though; I want to learn about what the fuck has happened to me, and how much I've changed, and how many are like me, and how not to shut other people down accidentally, like the first time.

And I want some friends.

So I'm going to try. I'm going to try to embrace my inhumanity. I'm going to try to be honest and open about it. I'm going to try to see it as some sort of gift, and not a curse! Hooray!!!

And I'll start right after I change the batteries in my hearing aids and decide what texture I want for dinner...

I keep meeting older people... it's kind of funny. I don't think I've actually met anyone my own age. Not that that won't change in the fall when school starts.

<lj-cut text=Diary>

I think it changes you though, to have to think on their level. Or try to think they way they do, but I know things get different when you get older. Like love...

I was flirted at last night I think... I know I have been a few times lately. I wish I could say it felt natural, but I'm only now starting to realize how truly fucked up my world was at home. It's weird that I was so different there, and it took becoming more different to get out of there. Bizarre really. I've wondered lately what it would be like to go back and visit in a year, and I can't even imagine it.

But I think I'm stalling, which considering I'm stalling so I don't tell something to my diary is kinda sad.

So, I've had some guys flirting with me, and last night... I think there was a girl who was. She was really friendly though, so it's hard to tell, but at one point she touched my arm and...

I thought about it all night, and I realized nobody has ever touched me. Like more than just a casual thing, or family, or just something incidental. No one has ever TOUCHED me. The guys who have flirted or been friendly have all been kinda shy, and since I'm as bad or worse, nothing's happened.

But so she touched my arm, and it was kind of casual, but there was something in her eyes, and it felt... Good. 

It felt SO GOOD.

She was cute, but... I don't think I looked at her like that, or had. I mean I don't know if I find her attractive, but do I? Am I that different from normal people now where I would even be different about... sex?

The problem is she's not the first girl I've caught myself staring at...

Confuuuuuuuuuused!

I'm going to go for a run I think, and see if that helps. I've been stretching 3 times a day, plus pretty much any time I'm just sitting around. I'm finally starting to get some of my flexibility back! OH MY GOD I was SO SORE after running the first day though. Stretching helped a lot for that, but OWWWW. Yesterday was better, and today I think I'm starting to get used to it. I should probably start doing sit-ups and stuff too, but I'm working my way into it gently.

I haven't met that girl again about the martial arts stuff, but I really want to talk to her about it. She was... 

Must. Run. Now.

(I think I'm going to start running, to get in better shape)

Clever title huh?

OK, I know it's super-dorky, but I'm in a good mood. 

<lj-cut text=Diary>

I still haven't heard anything from Amara, but I left her a message. 

My dad always said sleep cured ""most ills"", and I felt way better this morning. I think I've had too much time on my hands. I started stretching already, not that I've done any gymnastics stuff in a couple years now, but I miss being flexible. Besides, it would always be good for dates right?

OK, pervy, yeah, but it's weird. I haven't thought much about love and all that (except all the trashy bodice-rippers I read) for a while now, but... I keep meeting really cool people. Maybe I have a thing for older guys? It seems like some of them have a thing for me at least. I've met a few. I've also... nevermind, I don't want to worry about that now, I'm in way too good a mood.

So, running... yeah!

I met this girl at a coffee shop I went into to get out of the heat for a bit. She was a few years older I think, and totally gothed out. Well, I guess not totally, like she wasn't in vampire fangs or anything, but she had purple makeup, and a white stripe through her hair, and this kinda cool mesh top that looked cute, but I could never pull off. 

Anyway, we got talking, and talking about how her clothes would keep someone from touching her, and how she said when they do that they get hurt, and I said how I had been thinking about karate or something so I could protect myself since I'm in a city and all now. Well it turns out she is all into martial arts, and might start teaching. How cool would that be? A total ""girls kicking butt"" theme for sure!

She said, though, that one of the best things you can do is run. Cardio and all that I'm guessing. But totally good for your legs too (though I've heard bad for your knees). So since there are a couple parks around here I think I'm going to start running. Get my fat ass in shape before my thighs explode! OK, so I'm not anywhere near that, but still.

I'm totally psyched now though. Purpose!

I wonder if the high-school here has a gymnastics team?

I feel so horrible!

<lj-cut text=Diary>

I was sitting in front of a cup of tea across from this little college, and just watching people, and thinking of home, and this guy showed up. He was a little older than me, but definitely a mutant. I mean he had smoke coming off his skin, so it wasn't hard to guess, and when he caught me looking I think I flashed, 'cause he saw it and asked to sit down.

So I'm sitting there, and there's this older guy, and he's asking me my name, and it would have been really cool (and flattering!) but I can feel everyone watching us. I mean I could just FEEL their eyes. And.. so... I was kind of a bitch... I mean, I wasn't mean, but, I wasn't exactly... nice either. 

I was sort of hoping I had covered it, but he knew, and he could see them staring and pointing, so he got up and left.

I knew at the time I shouldn't have cared, and I should have told him to come back, or gone with him. I should have said that if he wasn't welcome there, than neither was I.

Nope, I didn't. I mean until he started asking questions they thought I was normal. I don't have any horns, or green skin, or smoke coming off me, so I was fine, right?

Am I really that stupidly shallow?

I mentioned that school, so that he'd have somewhere to go to talk with other people like- 

Oh God, I was about to say ""him"".

WHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHY??? FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!

I think I'm going to call Amara...  I think if I don't start coming to terms with all this soon I'm going to lose it, and I'm just going to hurt more people around me.

I can't even remember his name, just how sad he looked. And how shitty I felt.

I'm off to look for her number...

Something happened in the park...

<lj-cut text=Diary>

I found this great little park, and ran into Piotr there, but then... We were talking and something happened with some girl. She screamed and my hearing aids went all weird, and then he was dragging me away.

He started telling me all this stuff; that there's this group of evil mutants, and Magneto's (I need to look him up, I keep hearing his name) leading them and trying to kill normal humans, and that Xavier has this school to teach people to control their powers, but there's also a group of them to fight the bad guys, and it all sounds like something out of some stupid comic book.

What am I getting stuck in the middle of? 2 weeks ago I was at home, and if everything wasn't happy then at least it was normal. Now?

Now some giant hulk is trying to get me to join up with some weird vigilante freak squad, and it's all supposedly for my own good. And if I don't? Then my ""powers"" can go all out of control and I could hurt people. I don't know how I would, unless they're cooks and I kill their business, but whatever. This is all just freaking me out.

Now I don't know what to do! I had so much hope, and now it's gone. I thought this hotel was cool, but now it just seems cold. It's not my room. It's not my home. I want my mom and my life back. I want to go home. I'm so tired of crying myself to sleep. 

I feel so alone...

I seriously slept most of the day. I feel much better now, but like I've been being lazy. I should be getting something done, or doing something, or... I don't know... I'm antsy I guess. School is out, it was raining all day, and here I am sitting in a hotel alone trying to come to terms with everything. I guess I want to be busy just so I don't have to.

<lj-cut text=Diary>

I went out exploring though, after I finally got up. When I was unpacking I remembered I needed to get some spare batteries, so I wandered a bit and found a 2 story place with almost EVERYTHING. It's like the one in Sioux City.

So I found some batteries in this little electronics store, but the guy who worked there was a total dick about thing. I was looking in the wrong spot and he copped this serious attitude, getting all sarcastic. Really not what I needed at that point, lemme tell ya. Some other people there, including his coworkers got on him about though and he stormed off in a huff.

So once again I was near tears, standing in the middle of all the attention. I really, really wanted to try... disappearing.. but I was afraid they'd freak out, or think I was stealing stuff.

But one girl there, Amara, left, and then the girl behind the counter said that she should be careful of protesters, and so I asked what was going on. It turns out that since some mutant killed some people a little while back there have been protesters out at that school, the one Piotr (I found out his actual name from Amara) told me about. The one I think I'm supposed to be visiting later in the week.

I chased her down, and it was true, and she new Piotr, and guessed that I am... yeah. She was really nice though, kinda cool in that self-assured sort of way, and pretty. And she invited me to go there and visit. She said there was a get-together for a BBQ or whatever, and wanted me to come.

I made myself say yes, so, it looks like I'm going to meet a bunch of new people, and that they're probably all different too. And Piotr should be there, it would be nice to see him again. Come to think of it I was kind of babbling when I mentioned him, and asked her to say hello for me. I hope she doesn't think I'm crushing on him or anything like that...

3 days on buses. I'm so done with buses. Eating on a bus, sleeping on a bus... I HATE BUSES!!!

<lj-cut text=Diary>

OK, I'm done really. But the trip here was fucked. I spent the first 5 hours crying, and I think the second 5 hours I spent in tears. At least it was mostly empty, so no one noticed, or if they did they were cool enough about it not to say anything.

By my count I was on 8 different buses. Weee. I read like 3 books, and killed the batteries on my player 3 times. Batteries... I need to remember to get spare batteries.

On the last bus there was this totally creepy guy who kept staring at me. I think he was in his 20's somewhere, and he was way slarvy. His eyes were black, like all black, so I'm guessing he was one of- I'm guessing he was a mutant.

Fuck, that word is still hard to even type. 3 days on buses and you'd think I would have gotten over that much at least, right?

So I need more spare batteries because I lost my backpack. I kind of have a feeling the weirdo took it, but I don't know for sure, I finally fell asleep. I just know I couldn't find it when I had to get off. It didn't have much; the books I had finished, one I was in the middle of (I'm such a sucker for trashy romance, I know, even though... well, that's a later post I guess), the batts for my aids, and... all the fucking notes for where I was supposed to be going.

Yep, Salvia the Great strikes again. I travel hundreds of miles, then lose everything I need for my destination an hour away from it.

Soooo... I was pretty sure someone was supposed to meet me, so after I got off the bus I waited nice and conspicuously (after reporting my bag to the bus company). It turns out I was wrong about being picked up, but I got way hella lucky.

This HUGE guy named Peter (wait, no... Petor, or something like it, he sounded Russian and was a little hard to understand) found me. And I mean huge! He had like 2 feet on me, and I swear his arm was bigger than I am. He was really nice too, but older. He was cute though.

Anyway, he found me, and it turns out he's from the same school I'm supposed to be going to. He took me back over to the bus place to check on my bag, and gave them the number of this hotel I'm staying at now.

Yep! A hotel! Cool huh? And I've got a room all to myself!

It's sort of like a dorm in a way (or like the ones at our college), but still, it's fucking kickass I'm staying alone at a hotel. I'd tell everyone how the food is, but well... haha... I know, I use that joke every time I write.

Anyway, I'm waiting to hear back from this school now. A new life, and all that... I hope this all works. I'm so scared. At least my parents should be safe now without me around. Daddy should be able to find a new job, and mom always makes friends easy, so... I have good hopes for them.

I've made a new friend I guess, or at least have a knight in shining armor. He didn't ask any questions or anything, which was cool. I don't know how much of this I can face right now, let alone with a strange guy.

I'm going to try and get a little more sleep, and then see if some careful makeup can hide these ugly bags under my eyes. I need to do less crying...

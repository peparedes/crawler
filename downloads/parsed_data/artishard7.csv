"event","hello? hello?

it's been darker, but... 

i'm writing from the laundromat down the street.  i've forgotten coins so i'm just sort of sitting.  waiting.

it's currently 11:48 but i know my wristwatch is wrong.  i havn't fixed it because i like living in this sort of ""limbo""; this non-existent place that is very real, and though there are other guests around me- i am alone, in this place, in this time...  

i've been thinking out loud and by now people have noticed.  if i could write straight without looking, i'd be watching them, too.  we could mirror awkward glances and cold eyes.  but i am smiling, so we couldn't.  

i cut my leg pretty well today, on accident or not- i'm still deciding.  since the railing busted i havn't quite remembered every time i take the stairs.  this is the eighth time that i've cut my leg.  i guess i am perpetually forgetful.  i could take the elevator instead but the door-man makes me claustrophobic.  my coffee has just grown cold, but i will drink it.  there are people down the street paying extra for it anyway.  paying for their lack of patience.  i am not patient, either...

my mother hasn't called me in three weeks, i think she may have passed but i'm too afraid to find out.  i'm too afraid of something contageous, like being swarmed with a shortness of breath when i open her front door and suddenly my limbs are as cold as my coffee- my eyes bloom, my heart racing through my whole body and then suddenly i'm lying still, shrunken and discouraged in the wake of disease. though, i am already infected.  i mean, in this non-existent, exclusively mine place in time.  and everyone on the outside of my realm, they are all infected, too.  we are all dying.  

but that, that is not the point.  and i hope she calls soon.

well, i am alone now.  i've got about forty-five minutes to wash my clothes on someone else's quarters and leave.  i think i might give them one of my old t-shirts as a token, or a thank-you, or a joke.  i'm not too sure yet.  but maybe they'll think of me when they see it has appeared and i have gone.  maybe they'll remember."

"event","it's hard to remember days, mornings lost in a chronic haze.  breathe is fast and the trains are slow, i barely feel it though.  all day long i fantasize, in the dark behind all the people's eyes.  and then they disappear, words get lost in the atmosphere...

the truth, i tell-  i'll tell the truth, sixteen on a summer roof.  you ask for the facts?  well i'll give you proof.  hot sun on skin, that crimson dress too thin. for a winter of his words- i touched it, it felt good.

he speaks in a voice i know, a sound like sand when the tide is low.  we kissed to that voice each night, bathed in pale reactor light.  i cry when the morning comes, count my blessings and my funds.  say, ""thanks, God, for whatever comes"" and quickly cross my fingers.  all i want is a room somewhere, far away from the chemo air...

if i am lost for a day, try to find me.  but if i don't come back, then i won't look behind me.  all of the things that i thought were so easy, just got harder and harder each day.  december is darkest, in june there's the light, but this empty bedroom won't make anything right...

i dreamed i was dying, as i so often do.  and when i awoke, i was sure it was true.  i went to the window, threw my head to the sky and said ""whoever is up there, please don't let me die.""  but i can't live forever, i can't always be... one day i'll be sand on a beach by the sea.  the pages keep turning, i'll  mark off each day with a cross, and i'll laugh about all that we've lost.  


---

these songs have stolen what's left-
i wonder if you saw this, 
if you'd forgive.
and maybe let me look inside...
but then again,
you're my pristine and shining light
so please don't let me see your dark tonight.
but it'd be nice to see your face
withouth that haunting, too-sharp gaze.
wide eyed and cynical, you laugh at my quick wit,
but i don't ever get to see that grin...
it's casket closed, by the promises that broke.
it's life, 
and its quarter crisis.
are any of you buying this?
don't you miss it,
even, just maybe, a little bit?
with your perfect charm
and sudden escape-
makes me deny the posibility of fate.
i'm just waiting for the day i wake-
this can't be real,
we're all so fake.

...i didn't miss the bus,
i let it pass without me.
so i could stay by the sign,
where we kissed to say goodnight.
just so i could say goodbye 
alone, to the night i give this hope
for i no longer can keep you close.
and it's a shame the way the tide rolls in...
religiously claiming all of our sins,
to wash anew the shore we sit,
where our footprints no longer fit...
and that bottle with my message,
floating aimlessly, it's mission's missed.
but maybe if it reached its goal,
it'd be enough to bring you home.

that elusive cure i search to find
is just out of reach,
lost on the tide.

You're so clever with the way you push and pull,

And if these bedroom walls could talk,
they'd be haunting us forever.

Because I love it when you bite,

Where eager hands hold you close,

When you hold me just below the window,

We'd be basking in our lovers' sweat,
soaking hair sticking to our glistened skin.

I love it when you grin.

"event","we watched the cars pass from between spread blinds and shelter.  it was midnight and cold and wet.  we were not holding hands tonight, rather we stood a bit apart and watched the streets in silence.  you turn with a grin and i realize you aren't as deep in thought as i was.  i went to say something but couldn't.  you stepped forward to touch me, but didn't.  looking down in unison before sharing a laugh and me taking your grin...  then you fell so suddenly and i almost bent to catch you but it was the moment previous that made me so stiff and before i could wonder what you were thinking i felt that light, reassuring tug on my sleeve.  so here we are, as we've been many times before.  your head on my shoulder...  no longer keeping score.

you are my speckled indecision, nestled close i hold you just below my chin- arms wrapped around your waist.  is it not honesty that's falling from these cheeks? i hope you know i loved you.

---

these walls are spinning as i'm lying on the sinking bed upon the sucking floor and the falling ceiling regards harshly with spit that tastes of chalk and mint and i've gripped the sheets to pull myself away from what i'm about to obtain but tonight it's no dream and i will not wake.  comfort eludes while perfection resumes its place on the pedastle i've never graced and it's nights like this... 
that don't mean anything.

"event","Was it not the calming tide that brought you to my shore?

I waited, long and patient, for you to come around.  You did, and with eyes of the purest blue we started off in waves.  Our heart with thunder splashed and quaked 'til our body was no longer an appropriate shell.  We floated out to where the horizon deceives us and it's safe to say we are alone now.  Years had passed, maybe.  But now I feel my denial slip with comical knowledge, delivered in packaged regret.  I make the long swim home, no longer drifting on that bouyant passion.  The trip is hard and tolling.  

The shore does not welcome me kindly; every shell we picked so neatly placed to taint my steps and taunt my memory.  It's then that I realize the tide has long washed out your footprints.  The sea does not look so comforting anymore, and the night we fought so hard against patrols with scorning winds. Your body beckons from capping waves but your smile is not that of a friend's or lover's.

There's no way to begin. 

I always lose my socks,
except on 
certain occasion.
And since it's getting warmer,
I've been losing all my blankets.
What happened to the sheets, 
of fleece, 
that lined my pillows?
My window stays open,
for different notions.
And I don't mind 
at all.

If it rains, it pours,
and the smell floods
every sense
in this room.

So I'm captured.

And between the questions,
and the answers,
and my great epiphanies
and revelations,
that line my walls 
in chalk.

And between the stereo I never use,
the worn out guitar,
my thought-littered floor.
Somewhere, 
in between...
I'll be resting,
eventually.

If I had the motivation,
I might take out 
the black lights
that conveniently shine 
deep purple.
And if you look 
close enough
you can see all my 
confessions,
hidden in highlighter.

But I doubt you ever will,
because some
closed doors
just 
should not
be opened.
So don't come knocking,
while I'm fast asleep.
I fear that maybe,
I might sleep through
your time of need.

They say ""friendship""
can withstand the times,
but what if,
really,
you aren't a friend
of mine?

So proceed with caution,
because conversation
is more than just 
fun and games
when the benches we sit
are etched with our names.
...But you weren't there
when I added
the heart.

Collide?
We crash with summer-songs
and innocence,
yet we're both too intimate
with sin.

I'll miss your scent,
smile,
and the casual way 
you defeat all of these
defenses.
Don't say goodbye,
I'd rather we just leave.
We won't ever 
have to deal
with another terrible
ending.

Don't look back,
I'll miss your laugh,
and getting lost in 
summer-songs.

There's no way to end.
This is future love
without regrets

---

the bitter wind 
shakes the trees...
you depart, 
my heart you leave.
quite violent and 
most suddenly,
my body breaks 
with the tumbling leaves.
and dimming lights 
caress the street,
its warmth not reaching 
out to me.
instead i'm blinded,
-silent screams
pleading with this
unwanted tranquility.
...the bitter wind
shakes the trees. 

---

with a stereo that sits 
silent on the floor 
in the corner. 
littered in 16's 
and deeper meanings 
we lean against 
a bedroom wall caressed 
with absence and prison- 
we speak with cheap intention 
'bout the way the light shines through 
this one window room 
and we focus 
on the stains 
in the carpet. 

---

Pieces get lost somewhere between serene and complicate.  We paint over the light switch because theres never any bulbs, anyway.  Sink into an unmade bed where down from the pillows leaves our heads at a level best described as sunk.   I drown in thoughts of comical depression, lofted with grace in the faces embed in the textures of the walls.  A token of dignity lay strewn across uprooted floorboards and shattered tiles.   We touch like cold mornings in June, wide-eyed and curious. 

---

We talk like the spring time, in words that bleed revival and growth; the sun bleaching our hair into august, while we lose our shoes somewhere with butterflies in mid-july.  Weather-worn hands made for climbing trees lay in rest while we pick apart the faces in the clouds.  We tan from lazy afternoons dashed with lemonade and card games, only to turn red for a moment when the evenings' bonfire catches us in highlights of laughter.  We forget to close the windows and set clocks, preferring the tide of daylight to guide us.  Autumn takes us by storm, while we spend time analyzing how our bodies fall in leaves.  Tokens of remembrance are left in footprints made by cleverly painted feet- we talk trash with the neighbours and then grin behind their backs, pulling off our socks.  You write the sunset while I photograph your shadow.  We leave the letters and pictures in mailboxes, finding revelation in tall grass along the way. 

---

""Crazy!"", you would call me as I lept from love-seat to couch.  You were sitting so neatly I couldn't help but disrupt your concentration.  The T.V. was not my friend today as it faught for your affection.

Your feet had found their way into my lap, and your sigh had cued a massage.  Rather, with my finger tips and not my palms I pursued your pleasures and in turn you wiggled away with a look of silly exhaust.  Atleast you were smileing.

So I stood and took your hand- with a kiss you came tumbling over to rest with me on the floor.  Too original for the couch and not daring enough for kitchen counters, here is where I'll brush your shaggy hair back and pretend to have fallen asleep while you try to pretend you're not impressed. 

You wave your white flag in secrecy as you move a little closer.  And because I'm sleeping, I'll make like I hadn't noticed as you sneak your arm around me.  You smell good without cologne, and your silence tells me you've taken my lead and have closed your eyes.

This isn't war, it's retribution.

Storming minds of power love.
Forbidden romance taking dove.
Crazed and mad, yet full of truth..
Lonely girl finds pills and dilutes.. s o u l

Forgeing mothers signature,
Perscription filled,
Insomnia blurrs.
Bottled up for all its worth,
Breaking points are limited to earth.
Falling deep with entrancing hope,
body failing to reminisce and cope.

rain drops shatter the open mind,
enclosing fears further inside.
soul-described from futures passed,
lonely girl, thirteen years new..
Drowning in this mass of blue.

Blowing candles for fire strikes the burn,
Kiss me now to fight the hurt.
Empty love is what we find..
Arrogant boy, with deceitful eyes.

Such a couple maintain prosperity..
If only lonely girl could see.
Blind eyes focus on their life to be,
Leaving hope leaves all to bleed.

Haunted, matched, broken-mast..
Sail boat aching wind to blow..
Lonely girl chanting the world moves to slow..
...
the world moves to slow.

"event","well... life has been interesting lately.

there was alot of drama going on between two friends of mine-  i have a sense that it's not completely sorted out but atleast it's in the past.  that's all that matters now- because drama is fuckin retarded.

i'm over scott now... completely.  this was decided (realized, rather) when we hung out the friday before last and fooled around.  when we were dating i used to get the most incredible feeling when we were together. i've been in love before, three years inevitably takes it's toll but with scott it was so much more than that.  i can't even find a word for it, so we'll just stick with incredible.  sooo whipped over him, period.  so he dumps me and theres alot of bullshit... forgive him and move on.  then he decides he wants me back, and i'm such a sucker. so we hang out that friday previously mentioned and we fool around-  and i just didn't feel it.  my mush line for the scenario is "" i forgave him for what he did to me, but i guess my heart just wont forget "" lol.  

well that's all the boy drama i'm going to talk about.

On the other end of the scale, work is going alright.  my paycheck was 270.  i dont even remember the last time i had a paycheck close to 200.. wow.  lol.  i'm getting more hours because of the holidays and it's fuckin awesome.  buuut that'll change next week.  i've only got 13 hours and i bet it'll start to decrease further from there.  awwell.. Katelyn Knight might get fired.  YES! lol.  she's an all around shit employee...  i won't even get detailed about it- but she never does any work, she books off way too much, she gives away too many shifts, she complains she doesnt get any hours....     the last time she worked (which was supposed to be yesterday), she closed deli 2 hours early and refused to serve customers. so yesterday when she came in Carla (bossman) was going to write her up for that, but she had called in sick and bossman hung up on her.  Lol.  then her mom called back.  ohhh geezeeee!  so anyway, bossman calls me and i go in to work to save the day.  hrayyyy.

i'm SUPER pumped for xmas!  SUPER pumped to get my guitar amp, to xchange gifts with shayne, to see the family.  ughhhh sooo exciteee :)

with love,

"event","There's times when I question the solidity of redemption and wonder how far the stars can spread my fate.  One washed up bridge holds my feet but my heart falls passed my soles and through the weathered wood to rest below sea level.  For days I lay between mossed rocks, letting myself slip over and under waves, crashing into ugly colours so reflective of the moments leading up to this.  And when I saw you resting at my knees, I didn't see you at all.  Rather, you faked your way through my eyes and layed a costume, ball and chain in the depths of my imagination.  It's cold nights like this when I stray from my respective place at your side, watching an eletrical storm rave the sky with a glitching spike of sad and anger.  It's when I talk to you without saying a word, my fingers pulling back my palm from yours.  For one divine, splitting moment I realize our silent truth, flooding every sense with a panicked heat. One divine, splitting, truth disrupted only by the crash of my dropping heart.  I stay quiet in disbelief, searching for an answer.  The absence of your reply speaks volumes, and I dissolve unapologetically with our future.

Green Eyes,
you fool yourself with a masquerade to tranqulity.  All you find are land mines along the way.  So tip-toe yourself over the wet grass and pretend no one sees you wipe the shrapnel from your face. Green Eyes, what am I to do with you?  ...you lost your shine miles ago. 

---

I remember being articulate with words of embodied sentiment; whistling tunes to match the wind.  But now I've got nostalgia and sin, these lips can't reach the perfect pitch... Regret hangs stale above my head- right below the halo.  

---

You disregard your yesterdays with a cynics grin and ask yourself questions you know there aren't any answers for. Early morning sunshine won't cure the broken cough and tumored head, but you insist on seeing it anyway. Cigarettes and coffee for breakfast wasn't as promising as gin, so you took the bottle to forget. Finding accomplishment and new friends you contemplate with the voices on the wind. A clear horizon blurred the present and the beaten path you marched has long forgotten your name. Trees can shade the sun but they won't save you from yourself.

---

you find me hidden on the backs of leaves, 
carried on the wind like a well-kept secret; 
pleading to be written in cyptic messages 
only fit for bathroom stalls 
and park benches. 
the rain delays our trip 
and you're left standing drenched. 
holding on to my scent you breath me in 
as if it meant redemption. 
you depart your benedictions to the pavement 
with the saddest smile a boy could spread, 
empty hands being your only companion.

2) i really liked you.  genuinely.  but time has been corrosive, i think.  i cant see you being more to me than what you are right now.  but i change so often, tomorrow i might feel differently.  i dont think so though.  a certain turn of events has me believeing that i dont hold much for you.  i say things that are mostly lies.  and i act in falsehoods.  atleast, thats how it's starting to be.  i wouldnt give it a second thought.

3) i cant say much about you other than that youre really freakin confusing.  but i love you just the way you are.  i bet the future will be brighter than we anticipate.  you have crazy sex-appeal.  cant explain what you are even if i tried.  no words can do you justice.  just have to wait and see.  you and me, we wont be unhappy.  but i dont belong in anything you dream.  and i've never really gotten back up.

without will my lips parted to a shaking cigarette pressed between nerve-shot fingers. the lack of humidity from the outside rain had made it harder to breathe and colder than usual. but there wasnt much heat left anyway.

The Epitome of Romance 
it's spring, now. we keep our curtains drawn after it rains because the rainbows still make you cringe. the stars are out at night, though, after clear evenings that wait and stick. you explain constellations to me because i never read the books. our bed is always left unmade because whenever one of us walks by it, we like being reminded of hungry hands and hungrier hips. you leave me shower-steam messages on the bathroom mirror. you make us dinner and i watch you stir, secretly using extra ingredients to spell out our initials near the sink. we watch a sad movie and i can't find the tissues, so you let me use your sleeve. ""i bought you this."" ""i know."" and then you sneak away, coming back with crackers and a british accent. 

in the summer you wake me up with ice cubes and your tongue. our windows stay open all night and you nudge me when the neighbors whisper as they pass our house in the morning, so sure that they heard me the night before. you tell me about how you used to wait for me to climb through your window when we were children, when we relied on envelopes. the heat reminds us to buy popsicles on tuesday. we sit with our legs crossed on hot pavement at three in the afternoon. we go swimming in a pool that doesn't belong to us. you watch as i clumsily climb over the chain-link fence, grinning and waiting for me to notice that we could've simply walked through the gate. i do handstands underwater and you kiss my ankles. later, we leave our shoes at home and buy mangoes from a man in a straw hat. his skin reminds me of wax, his fingernails are clean. he thanks us with four teeth and a firm handshake. once we hit the corner, i pull you into the shade. we feed the fruit to each other, every sliver giving us reason to slip our fingers further and further into each others mouths. you don't wait for me to swallow and we make urgent love against a brick wall behind a grocery store with beige canopies. my skirt has loose threads on the bottom where lace should live. you grab onto these strings and curl them around your fingers and i make myself remember to cut them off later and leave them underneath your pillow to remind you of the way i sounded, scraping against brick. we walk away holding hands, laughing to ourselves. i take a shower when we get home and notice marks on the small of my back from your nails. always deeper you try, and always deeper you get. the next day i go back to photograph the canopies.

i try to bake you a cake in september but i'm not the cook, and you'd rather eat rice. sometimes when we can't sleep, we sit in the dry bathtub and drink wine. you tell me jokes that make me cover my face with my hands and we both write out a grocery list that somehow seems funnier because the bottle is almost empty. the days feel wrong to me because we are not buying school supplies, so you give me a pencil case and tell me i can use it for marijuana and tobacco. because it is october and we are not in california, the orange leaves are foreign and beautiful to me. you pick up the small ones as we walk and put them in my hair. on the twenty seventh of november, i dance because you are typing. you say, ""it is our poem."" and later, as you read it to me, i am moved by the tone of your voice, the delicate force you always use when the words mean something extra to you. i click my tongue and close my eyes. i don't realize you've stopped reading and fallen to your knees until i feel your shoulders underneath the backs of my thighs.

winter means you button my coat for me and i pick which scarf matches your socks. we discuss ringlets and mittens over hot chocolate, playfully kicking each other underneath the kitchen table. i shiver more than you do in the snow, and you wrap your arms around me, asking the sky why you got stuck with a girl who thinks that fifty-two degrees is cold. you sigh, ""that's it. i want a refund."" and smile a smile that warms the ice right out of me. in february, the skies begin to look less threatening. before the sun comes up, we hold each other in front of the fireplace; you whispering into my collarbone, me touching your hair and wanting to kiss your chin. i play with your hands and talk about the wallpaper, the way it's peeling, how i think we should take it all down, paint our world red. it is there, in front of the fire, where we will turn into something else. something wet and alive. there will be wrists and there will be shoulder blades. 

in the spring, we are pale. in the summer, we are barefoot. in the fall, we are poets. in the winter, we are safe. but we are always touching. moving as mouths at a train station, a french restaurant, a library. you pull away from me, for a split second, sometime in mid-december. just to smile. because that's really the only reason to break a twelve month long kiss."

as seasons change you drift away, the sweetest smile painted upon that face of yours. for i know you are content, spilling off the edge in pieces. i'll always wonder where the wind has left you, if it has ever left you at all. we admired you, beautiful as you shaped the world with soaking hands. you always loved to clutter out your body, said ""being free is liberating. disarray, the sun is warm even on the coldest days."" and just like always your words would hang in my head for days and days... while i tried to see what you did. tried to feel what you believed in. tried to understand how such a busy being always became so serene in conversation- so sure of themself even when the moment has lost you. you were never barred by society, Young Timeless. never afraid to be who you wanted... to see truth, and speak honest. so close your eyes for one last time and forget you ever had the purest blues. breathing easy, you would drop in from somewhere up above, only to disappear just as soon. you were the epitome of love, and we loved you. where wisdom pours out to meet compassion and grace, we could find you basking knee deep in your heavenly veins. you were called an angel... beautiful, as you shaped the world with soaking hands.

Where Lovers Sigh

where lovers sigh, love set aside.
amidst thread-bare sheets that kiss
upon the skin, dressed in regret
lonely nights have gave way to this.

and i'll love you for everything you promised,
while knowing it'll never be achieved.  
never a faker, i took you for the dreamer
you so badly wanted to be.  

so kiss me, boy.  
dont let this waste.  
without the world in your palms, 
you can still hold my hands with grace.

"event","so i could write another pointless blog about how pissed/upset/whatever i am about the shit with x-dave.  but w.e, it aint worth it.  alls ill say, is that i wish we never met... cus in the end, there isnt even a friendship left to save.  disappointed?  yah... is that life?  yah...  can i do better?  yah...

but i do need to move on... like im over him, but i havnt moved on.  i wanna find someone new... im lonely, but dont mistake that for desperate.  although im deffinitly anxious and excited to see whats gunna happen next.  Twitcheroo is sposed to come over today n stuff.  I doubt she will tho.. she never does.  awwell.. ANTM is on tonight.  UFC is on tomorrow. and friday is well, friday.

I think ill call josh soon.. I havnt talked to him in a while.  Prolly chillen with dan bond and ike sometime this weekend.  deffinitly no progress there, btw. Dave doesnt know what he wants or w.e so im not wasting my time.  hes sweet as a friend tho.  btw, happy birthday ikonov!!

OH, and i go for my lung shit tomorrow.  im kinda nervous.  i hope its nothin too serious... actually, i hope its nothing serious at all.  hm..

i feel a fight and i think i want to die so baby boy if i lose balance catch me when i fall."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Loooongish"">Well.. Been fightin with the mums lately.  Now that I dont go out as much I do stuff around the house.  I do laundry, I watch the kids, pick them up from the bus stop, i clean up the living room once in a while, i do the dishwasher, i do the cat litter... and i never get a thankyou. ever.  so im pretty pissed about that because she treats me like i owe her this shit.  She bitches about he she never gets a thank you?  thats bull.  Besides, she sits at home all day and does nothing.  She doesnt have a job, and i hate to say it but shes supposed to do laundry every so often and keep the house tidy.  she can sleep all day cus my lil brothers in school and my sister is every other day, and yet she needs naps?  

whatever..

So david doesnt hate me, atleast i hope not.  I was feelin pretty shitty about saturday.  I lead em on n crapola but he told me he was ok with meeting as ""Friends"" when really he wanted more.  and i tried to warn him.  but w.e  we talked yesterday/last night which was nice.  I wont be calling him every day or anything but ill be sure to keep in touch.  It kind of sucks, being alone and such.  and part of me does want him back but i know better...  Besides if its meant to be then one day it will be, right?  Well anyways.. I think hes starting to understand himself a little better now and hes been making friends which is good.  I still care aboot em tonnes.  But when we talk now, its a bit different.  he said some hurtful shit last night which shouldnt have bothered me, but it did.  but im a big girl, and what can i expect really?  we arent dating, he doesnt need to sugar coat anything or w.e

So today im sposed to be having ppl over.  which is nice cus shit i need to make new friends.  Had a nice talk about that kinda stuff with Josh.  we're alot alike.  We both started grade 9 getting into the wrong crowd, and as the years went on they got worse and we got stranded.  So he did what ive been wanting to do, which was switch schools.  but he said it was the worse mistake he ever made because he didnt really know anyone else and everyone already has their ""clique"" and thats aboot it.  which i can relate to... like i have ""school friends"" but they never wanna do anything after school cus of their own little ""cliques"" its gay so yah.. but on another note, this boys got me pretty confused cus when were together he acts like he wants to be with me... we joke and flirt n get close n stuff, there still hasnt been a kiss (even tho we both admitted we would go for it, were just too nervous and no, knowing that doesnt help the situation cus ur still friggin nervous)...  but theres the whole friendship thing and is it really worth risking it?  ugh.. oh well.  

So i need to concentrate on school more, i guess.  as well as get out more.  start doing things with ppl and crap like that.  anyway yah i know this was long well w.e its my journal for a reason.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Weeekend"">Ooook... So i'll start from the beginning.  Friday was a quiet night, i wanted to go party but my mum was against it. so rather, i just stayed in and kept a quiet night.  oh, and i had lost my purse with my drivers license in it, and i swore to all shit that it was my stepdad who hid it somewhere cus ya hes a raccoon sometimes.  and my mum didnt believe me cus he swore to all shit as well that he didnt.  so she spent all friday tripping out hard core on my for it.. and then oh, guess what, my stepdad conveniently finds my purse behind the coffee table in the living room.  which, we had already checked prior to his amazing find.  geeze.. raccoon strikes again.  Oh yah, then i went to travs and i watched Prime which was a good movie.

Saturday i woke up and i was a bit jittery.  Hangin out with josh(which wasnt jittery) but i was sposed to go out with david (x david), and well yah.. weird much?  So, i just want a friendship with the boy and i really thought he was ready for it.  I guess i was just being selfish because although he told me it would have been fine, i knew it wouldnt.  i mean sure he was a perfect gentlemen, but whats going through my head the whole time is how long is this gunna last befor things go back to how they were?  Because everything is golden in the beginning, right?  and he even said himself he was trying to make a good ""first impression"".  ugh.  im a confused 16 year old girl and i onno what the shits going on soooo... i cant be that girl for him and it killed him just trying to be friends and i wished it wouldnt but yah.  thats what happened on my saturday.

and well its the sunday morning after, and not to mention i called dave in tears last night choking out apologies.  i hope he understands.   i know he hates me now but one day he'll see.  other than that.. well its almost 11:30 and i need some breakfast and a tea.  who knows what the day holds, as Matt Sotera's latest entry would elaborate.

"event","<lj-cut text=""dave"">Sometimes I wish I said ""let's take a break"" rather then ""let's break up"". She's no good for you and I know that but you put me in this position that's like ""I know you care about me, so i'm gunna do the worse that I can to myself so you feel terrible about this. So you feel like the only way i'll be the best that I can is if you're with me"". omg... im so fucking lost and im so fucking scared and im so friggin lonely that im dying in my own crazy, lovely, little way. 

I need you like water in my lungs. 

I never quite understood that line but now I fully understand it 100%. I need him like water in my lungs. I'm repeating it over and over in my head as if it were the answer to life. I feel like i need you. When you brought me the roses, we hugged befor you left. and for an instant you fit back into my arms so perfectly that I could have just rushed you back into the seat at my familys table that will forever be waiting. because no matter how many boys, they'll never take your place. And although I dont agree with alot of shit like who your with or what your doing I know she'll treat you fine and the day she doesnt is the day I fucking whoop her ass. 

But then I think like why the hell should I still care, right? Like fuck. Well.. I love you. there, I said it. but im not IN love with you. I dont know its fuckin fucked up. Why is everything so complicated. Why dont you do the million little things that you could have done in these past years? Why couldnt I ever be shown your love and only expected to feel it when half the time we we're cold as ice. 

I want you back so bad but then I think about all the b.s in our relationship and i remember exactly why this happened. And dont think that I just forget about the good cus i dont... I remember valentines day and you telling me we werent doin shit cus it was just a dumb fake holiday... and then showing up with this giant ass card n flowers, to take me out to dinner. 

Ok, i remember it all. I miss you like crazy. I wanna call you and talk for hours. I wanna lay with you and discuss our life plans, while i joke about the future and ritzy lifestyles while you modestly assume the most likely. but your gone now... and the only way to get you back is if i drop my world and run back to you and that aint gunna happen... if only i had some sign.. if only i knew what to do. 

Maybe in the future something will happen because shit if this is meant to be it will be. If i could see you again i would crash but i dont want to do something im gunna regret. Boy o boy... 

I really needed to get this off my chest. 
i need you like water in my lungs..</lj-cut>"

Updates in the life of Ashley

Monday marked the 3rd week of my new single life and I'm not gunna lie, it's goin pretty good.  He's brought my roses and we've had a few small conversations but... too little, too late, ya know?  Although, I do miss some things about our relationship.  I miss the jokes, the laughs, the play fighting, and over-all I just miss my best friend.  It's ok though i'm doin fine.

I havn't chilled with my clone since a few weeks back. Which is ok, I think it's best if we stay friends for now anyways.  maybe the future might hold something more, but i aint sweatin it.

Joshua, on the other hand.  ugh hes a cutie.  We hung out four days in a row, and I don't think we ever stopped laughing.  pillow fighting, joking, laughing, flirting... Makes me feel like I did a month ago, just without all the fighting.

Do I like him?  12 years of friendship puts alot between us and I onno if im ready to chance it with something more.  In honesty though, I think we would still be friends even if a relationship didnt work out.  We get pretty close but there hasnt been a kiss...  yet, anyways.  only time will tell. 

I got Lung Xrays today and the Doc wants to do this other test, i think its for asthma maybe.  but my lungs are fucked up and I find out on thursday whats wrong with me.

... I worry about David."

Lol.  i was ready to say goodbye.  hes takin it real rough, doesnt think our relationship was as bad as it was.  guess he felt like without me there wasnt much else.  i think hes starting to see now, and i know he'll he fine eventually.  in the mean time, ill still be around to talk to him once in a while.  just gotta make sure to keep it platonic and that he understands, so's not to lead em on.  I still love em, im just not -in- love with him.

On another note, I hung out with dave ikonov last weekend and ugh i really think im starting to like him.  his friends think im the coolest ever, cus i whooped em at poker n can play n64. Lol.  we're hanging out again this weekend and maybe i can open his eyes to all i have to offer.

"event","<lj-cut text=""brighterthanyouwishyouwere"">Because I can't sleep when everything feels so blurry...  And I'm slipping and slurring through choked words that bend the mind let alone a verse- to make it some how seem more personal to mean something to me.  So i'll catch my breath and try to forget as I cling to what was and future regrets- that I won't admit to 'cause im too proud to stand down and hang my head to rest in bed; for one more night just to wake up again and to start a fight.  Against this mainstream living and all the dreams that individuality has strived for.  Yet we're all wanting the same things- and I can't help but feel like were drowning in our own sweat, as we strive for something better while being too blind to see the end.  

Where do we go when there's no where else left?  If only I could fly myself out and into the blue, to reconnect with me and you.  To try and revive the things let slip and burn our knuckles white with this ambitious grip.  And it's
all right at the end of the night when there's nothing left to say, no more guessing to be made.  ...And I'll still wonder and question and pry and guess till my mind splits from this never ending test; to recall what it was that made me smile and I'll remember your face every once in a while.

I can't say I'm honest when I don't want to admit, even to myself how deep these feelings fit.  Right into my veins I'll never get away from what I am and who you are and where we're gunna be.  I want to circle the globe and never look back because the future is now and as we move on the present is packed- into a nice neat box labeled yesterday's news and we'll all look on to the next world issue of peace, love, and what ever else we'll never see.  every one knows we're failing, falling to tragedy.  It's just a matter of time befor history repeats and we'll be back hand in hand, striving for releif.

So with this kiss I give you my world, and I hope you'll understand that I'm still just a girl- whose confused and lonely yet I have you by my side, to keep me strong and to live for my life.  Would you die for me?  I wonder and yet I know the truth.  As you deny any bonds I know im still kept close to you.  So hold my hand and dont you dare let go 'cause without you I'm
afraid I won't be much more</lj-cut>"

Forgetting names and faces

As if they could erase it

You never get caught in the rain
When I'm drenched to the bone every time
You're the first one to swim across the Seine
I lag behind
You're always ahead of the game
While I drag behind
The call to arms was never true 
Time to embody here's to you 
I'll tell you stories bruised and blue 
Drum machines and landslides 
Bite the hand that feeds, tap the vein that bleeds,
Down on my bended knees, I break the back of love for you
I break the back of love for you!

Going camping on tuesday, till the 21st.  It's gunna be booommmmbbbbb.

Now that that's out of the way... As for myself?  Well, my summer has been kind of slow.  Only one outrageous party which wasn't even -that- outrageous.  We were just really drunk.  Lmfao.  What a kickass time tho.  Here's a little recap.

KINGS!!!
""Mmaaatthhheeewwww!!!!  Get over here NOW!""
Paddle boat, anyone?
Nicky menge les pleut!
""Pphhiiilllliiipp!!""

GEeeeze. Well..  a quiet night tonight, a lil bbquing and some bonfireness late on.

Hope everyone else is as relaxed as me.  Remember, summer isn't about who you spent it with and what you did, it's about self preservation and enjoying the time rewarded to close our eyes and embrace life...  self exploration.

Its hard to feel anything but abandoned when we're sitting in silence, and your cold glare lets me know that youre still aware of my presence.  its hard to say anything when your screaming through closed lips... lucky for you i can see whats written all over your face, and i wont reply with anything but the shut of your door... you can put to rest your ""why hasnt she left yet"" and know that if its what you want then i wont be coming back.

Where is the love in your closed hands and heart?  Even at our worse i cant hide mine... although, somtimes i wish i could.  I wish i could take these feelings and bury them some place deep within me, so that maybe you might not be able to see them so clearly, as if i wasnt constantly spilling my heart out for you.  And if we're too lost in anger my love still bleeds through me, staining your blankets and pillows with my soul.  Sometimes i wish that i didnt wear my heart on my sleeve so well... Sometimes i wish i couldnt show you exactly how i felt.  yet, its not as easy as id like it to be, i cant ever deny you what i cant deny me.

Sometimes i want my hugs and kisses back...   To make you realize that i might not be here forever.  Sometimes i just wish you could see that im not the little girl you make me out to be.  Im sick of always having to tell you how i feel, and im sick of feeling like i always have to.

At times i can proudly admit that you constantly pop up into my head, about a bajillion times a day.  yet sometimes ill fight my thoughts because im sure that im not in yours.  Or am i?  fuck.. i dont know.  and im sick of wanting to know.  and im sick of being plagued with does he or does he not because your too.. whatever, to ever tell me.  but its ok, i spose...  cus when im with you my doubts fade and ill blame my worrys on my own bad habit of over-analyzing.

"event","Well, I've come to the conclusing that I seldom update...  And if in fact I find it within my largely cramped and confused mind that I may have something to say to post down in this thing, that it's more likely to be a poem than anything you'd actually want to read.  

Thus, my goal of this little speil is to -not- submit a poem.  Instead, if I may, search to find the words to express my visions and emotions that cause the above stated symptoms and possibly free my mind from these riveted, entangled wires.

I've been contemplating alot lately about a number of topics that, more often than not, lead me into the depths of wonderment till im lost in deeds unfathomable yet oh so pure.  True, is it not?  That the utopia and well of wealth that goodness brings is as unreachable as an honest lawyer.

Love? What is ""Love"".  It's the bond I share with [you], not of this world and nothing of material... Yet it can grow, be seen and touched, as well as broken.  What's more wordly than the one thing that, technically, isn't there?  I mean, isn't there like you or I is here.  You can't -really- reach out, grab it, hold it or break it.  Yet, -really-, you can.  

Is it crucial or critical? ...To analyze what I already know first hand to be the most pure of all things, to know that if all the world shared this feeling, that you and I share; That we can build a bridge to that unreachable utopia that is so close, yet so far.  We're all good people, some where deep down inside.  As long as we can hold on to what he have, and know well enough what it is exactly we have (without having to wait till we loose it to really acknowledge its value) then we can repair this blue sky back to the golden radiance it so rightfully deserves.

You and I, we'll be just fine.

But yah, I wouldnt let that fly.  its already too old and full grown so yah. -thumbs down- So!  There was another add in the paper for 6week old puppys.. 50 bucks.  So dave called cus we wanted to find out what kind they were.  Turns out, they were Bullmastiff(huge ass dog) and a golden lab mix.  Then we went to the petstores n what not, lookin at other puppies which were extremely over priced,along with their kittys.  100bucks for just a regular, plain black cat..  how shitty is that?  

So we call the chick with the bullmastiff/lab pups, and asked if we could see them.  cus we wondered what the hell that would look like.  Shes like ""well, theres already two people on their way.. and theyres only 2 puppies left, soo.. first come first serve"".  We ended up getting there first, and OMG THEY ARE SOOO CUTE!  So we got one  :D:D:D  She looks -exactly- like a rottweiler, except with a cuter face.  and she wont be as chunky.  But aww.. shes sooo pretty.. We named her Quinn

Ive just let all my days build up to compile one medium sized spiel on my recent life.  so lets get on with it
--
Well, for starters, I lovers my david.  2 years in 10 days.  Im sooo excited.  
Kort and I went to sign up for boxing.  well, we just got our papers n what not.  we gotta get the moneys and actually go join.  itll be sweet.  i just baught new guitar strings, ernie ball custom gauge.  oh, and i baught some.. uh.. GRS? GHS?  something like that.  turns my fretboard/strings to butter... its just great. Lol. also, on my recent trip to L&M, i learned that price means shit.  I played a 3grand gibson acoustic..  meh.. wood was really pretty, golden flamed everything.  but it didnt play or sound as nice as it looked.  Then, the same day, my buddy Patty mc Beef brought over his new acoustic.  a 300 washburn that sounds amazing.  he showed me some crazy tunings, like open d (prison tuning) which could even make -dave- sound like a guitar-gawd.  

Uhhm..  daves gotten alot of new furniture for his room n such.  and this new bunk-bed type thinger..  im afraid its gunna break when were.. yea..  anyways, when i started this i had alot more to say but now i cant think of much.  city and colour on friday.  booze friday night, can anyone say st.pattys? hells yes mother fuckas.  OH! i played a crazy ass electric at L&M too.. a -lime-green jackson.  didnt sound as pretty as my schechy tho.. i think im in love. o.o

so maybe this is getting kind of long?  well, Good.  for everyone elses posts that i read, when they post like.. religeously.  im just making up for lost time I guess.  i just got my ass kicked in poker...  blah.  Im sooo sleepy.. but i dont wanna go to bed.  i stayed up till like.. fuck i dont even remember.. talking to chris e (he was smashed).  i miss that kid sometimes.  but, good news, he quit smokin weed.  so proud of him.  :)

alright, last paragraph, i promise.  I guess pneumonia is going around, so be careful all you dumb ass smokers.  my aunt is like really sick with it right now, and i guess its contageous.  i hope i dont get it.. i hate being sick.  specially when i have soo many beers to drink :D  alright tho, im peacin out i need some sleep. and its like what, 3:12 a.m..?  ill be seein my babes in aboot 11 hours.  yes... im a loser.  

btw...  no offence to anyone, but im so fuckin sick of drama.  im so fuckin sick of hearing it, reading it, every where.  ""my life sucks, God hates me, did i mention my life sucks?  excuse me while I wallow in my pain because my life is so shitty shit. let me go listen to my favorite song, stab you rip stab stab""  Haha.. jokes, anyone? anyways..   blah blah fucking blah. ya know what.. youre never gunna get to where you want to be, which would be happiness, atleast thats what ive been led to understand.  considering, everyone hates being so depressed and alone.  yet, i cant figure out why everyones so prone to being stuck in their own self-made ruts.  Fuck.  im SO SICK OF EVERYONE HATING EVERYTHING.  Life is awesome.  hey, mine isnt perfect either, and i have my shitty days just like everyone else.  cus were all teens, all cliche, all going through the same bullshit. if you want to be different in society, then fuck the piercings that everyone has, fuck the ""rebellious"" hair that everyone has.  fuck fads.  be what you are.  and im finding it hard to believe that everyones the same.  want to be different?  be happy. fuck.  k..  that thing about last paragraph, i lied.  my bad.

ponder the pointless of all thats lost and remember not to forget the pulse that beats within these hearts concealed through malicious hopes held high on heels that carry feet attatched to long legs in boots, connected to a body whose soul is confused and trapped within that leather vest, holds a heart thats beating with sin. 

scornful lies buckled the hopes that once embraced this young girls loathes but as time went on and reality hit that girl shrunk down into the deepest pits.  upon realizing the world for what it is and being abused from the most demeaning exits of being seen as just another worthless comodity  

so with those tears that shred the skin with the darkest affections of smeared contemporary red lipsticks from married men and broken homes crawled out this little girl from the blackest of holes and into the light reflected from redemption in the purest form a hand reached out to repair the worn.

I'll jump from the tallest building with the courage that you give me, transferred from your soul through your bodies finger tips, which happen to be locked into mine as this transfusion of mental strength becomes complete.  And although I have the trust that as I fall my wings will spread and I'll become the angel you claim me to be...  I can't leave this edge unless you promise not to let go of me.  And although you've never let me climb down from your pedastle, I'll show you in this downward spiral that you're as great to me as I am to you.  So let's leap, with faith.  For it holds this love together and as long as I can feel you, I know It'll make us unstoppable, even to this rising concrete whose arms are spread wide to meet and greet our bodies in malicious spite.  But oh, no.  Not today.  Today, we will fly.

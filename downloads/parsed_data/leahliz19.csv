This weekend was pretty fun besides me breaking my ass in Durban's jeep...ouch.  After that Jen and I went out to Nicks for a fire, it was a great time.

Tonight Kate, brit and I are going to a cookout over at phils house.  Then i have an exam at 8 tonight and then maybe back to the BBQ to have some brews...haha.  Not to many though, i have another exam at 10 tommorow, but I guess I could always go back to bed.  Only like one week and a half until Jen and I drive to Arkansas to see Suggy.  Ahh it should be a fun time, i am definatley due for some sug time.  I've been talking about visiting her forever and now i get to finally go see her...ahh what excitement."

"event","Well I decided to update my journal cause some people were giving me some grief over it.  Spring break was nice and relaxing till Matt and I broke up and then i found out one my best girls was sick again:(   So that was a little depressing.  Oh well about Matt, life goes on.  Kate and I are going to GR today to visit Lindz so that should be a good time, I know she needs some company...especially my company:)  Then Kate and I might go on a secret visit in GR.  So everything can only get better from here on out and plus the sun is shining.  Oh and you know how in one of my last journals i was excited to hang out with Kendy?  Well I was a retard and thought her Spring Break was the same as mine so i didn't get to see her...ahh that sucks.  Hopefully I will see her soon though.  Well all see ya later."

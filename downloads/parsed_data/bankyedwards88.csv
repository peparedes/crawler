oh my god, so denise took one of the worst spills i have ever seen.  We were at a halloween party and as we were leaving she slipped on the steps.  she fell like the whole way down, i can't get it out of my head it was just so terrible.  she really lucked out, had she not been dressed up as pregnant britney, it would have been much worse.  her fake belly took a lot of the hits, it's all dented to hell, we should have it bronzed or something.  so, she pretty much just walked away with a bad split lip and maybe a chipped tooth (we're not sure yet), which in my opinion is a way better than being paralyzed.  i know some of you will argue for paralysis, but i'll take a bloody lip any day.

it's hard to even think about though, and i just can't get it out of my mind.  all i could think about is trying to catch her or trying to do something, but i wasn't fast enough to do anything.  we just really lucked out."

i didn't get much done this weekend.  saw some movies and i had a ton of reading to do.
fantastic four was like the worst movie ever... marvel should hire me now, someone needs to start putting in some quality control.  it was like a two hour sitcom, and not even a good sitcom.

oh and transformers the movie still rocked a little.  the last time i saw it, i was six and it blew my mind.  it didn't blow my mind this time, but watchable.  i didn't remember the rock sound track though, or all the dead robots.  it was like a vietnam movie, but with robots.  i remembered the fight scene between megatron and octimus prime though... still one of the best robot fight scenes in cinema."

i was reading ""Killer in Drag"" by Ed Wood.  Just an awful book, but good compared to his movies.  it's sort of sad knowing that he had some talent... not that he wasn't sort of sad before, but i don't know.  i mean knowing that he had a little talent just makes his movies that much worse.  and i know some of you will fight for ed wood... but come on!  the only thing really good about his movies is that there's nothing good about his movies.
but his book was like his movie realized.  all the crappiness he couldn't capture on film he captured on the page.  it was his angora dream come true.  anyway, read it and i'm not quite as dead inside as i thought i would be... pleasant surprise."

oh, and weezer was awesome!  rivers was all over the stage like michael j. fox in back to the future, he was like on his back and jumping off speakers and sliding on his knees.  he was even dressed like marty mcfly... little suit coat that i'm sure he got at the boy's section at jc penny.  at one point he disappeared and popped up in the middle of crowd, it was sweet, plus they played like a ton of old stuff.  and hearing their stuff off the new album live was great, i wasn't really digging it until i heard it live.

everyone got me great stuff too, even though i told everyone not to get me anything because we were going to drop money at dave and buster's.  ann and barry got me a family guy poker set, nicki got me both chasing amy and jay and silent bob strikes back (the movies that were stolen from me last year!)... i was very surprised and excited to have those movies back.  erin got me super monkey ball 2 (p.s. she's totally addicted to monkey ball now).  and denise got me a really nice ipod case, which i wanted and needed pretty bad.
cooper made pot cupcakes... and after a couple of those things got pretty fuzzy, but i think everyone had a pretty good time."

i saw that movie sky captain and the world of tomorrow the other day.  it was so awful, just horrific acting.  the effects were good enough, but it was like, no matter where the movie took place, everyone seemed like they were in the same room (because they were).  like they're on a freezing mountain... but you can totally tell that they are in a blue room of modest to warm temperature.  i guess being in actual places and interacting with real things still counts for something.  at least with those bad actors it does."

and you feel so bad because i want to like his movies... i remember his good movies, and you really have to think way back to remember one (unless you caught big fish--but i don't because i didn't like that movie either).  he's like the mel brooks of being weird because you remember his classics and you want to jive with him but it just isn't there anymore.

but that rant aside, i'm going to arizona tomorrow for my grandpa's 85th birthday.  it's gonna be at the american legion, so you know it's going to be a blast.  but my entire family's going, so it'll be fun to see everyone again."

i just hate having it because even though i have it so often, i always think it's for real.  sometimes you know it's a dream, and even though garfield is about to shot you with a sawed off shotgun you say, ""it's cool, this is a dream, i'm just gonna fly around.""  then you fly.  but this one always gets me.  i always wake up thinking i really fucked this one up... if only i paid attention in driver's ed.  and sometimes i have to take my high school classes in a really bad inner city school with chain link fences and metal detectors everywhere.  and i just know they're going to make me squeal like a pig.  and i don't want to go back to high school, man."

"event","so, i read the electric kool-aid acid test and i really want to try acid.  like just once... once is good enough for me.  no need to damage my brain any more than it already is.  but i'm sort of scared of it too. like all the horror stories just freak me out.  like it stays in your system and just fucks you up a little bit forever.  FOREVER (that was the voice of doom just then, you know, with the echo and everything).  so, i don't think i want to try enough to actually seek it out.  but if it was sitting there in the middle of the street, who knows?  
and everyone says, i should just drink more and not risk it, but i want a vision dammit!  i want to see a bear juggling in the corner!  i want to be stranded in medieval times (the actual medieval times, not the dinner and show)!  i want to have a vulcan mind meld with somebody! and booze just doesn't do that.
the book was only ok though, it had some real lags.  like there was a lot of hippie acid poetry, and i think hippie acid poetry is only good when you're on acid.  reading it sober i would think that these people would realize how truly awful it is, but they don't.  another reason not to try it, because maybe i'll up like them and think dopey shit is really good (like star wars episode III).  but all the super hero mythology, and group mind stuff, and the histories of everything were pretty fascinating.  like i said, an ok read, nothing special though--except of course for the desire to try acid, which is gnawing at my bones."

at the very same time though, my ego has me all bent out of shape.  i shouldn't care if someone questions what i do, but i do. i haven't eaten beef, fish, or poultry in quite a while... long enough to say, ""hey, i'm a vegetarian.""  and no one should be able to take that from me.
a little definition time, i would fall in the Lacto-ovo-vegetarian category.  probably the laziest of all vegetarians.  but i never claimed to be wonderful.  it's not like i seek out animal fat either, like i don't have lard sundaes or anything like that.

p.s.
glutens rule!"

"event","so, i finally saw episode III this weekend and how much of a let down was that?  everyone's been going on and on about how wonderful it was.  people have been cutting it way too much slack simply because it's better than the other prequeals... that's really not a difficult feat and doesn't make a movie good, it just makes it slightly better than the complete disasters that are episodes I and II.
the effects and the fighting were nice enough, but it doesn't really make up for a fairly horrible script and hayden christensen's patented wooden acting.  lucas has an elementary school understanding of dialog and human emotions.  and i really don't know how you can say a movie is good when every dramatic scene is laugh out loud funny (i.e. when darth vader clenches his fists and screams no... possibly one of the funnest moments in cinema).  padem's and anakin's relationship is ridiculous... obviously just lucas knows nothing of real love or he wouldn't have a character die of something as corny as a broken heart.
yoda was great and as always ewan mcgregor does a fine alec guinness imitation.  but besides that, what was good about it?  it doesn't even do a good job connecting the movies.  i mean, doesn't leia say she remembers her mom in return of the jedi?  and i assume she meant her real mom (why else would luke give a fuck), but how can she remember someone who died?  and didn't obi-wan say that darth vader hunted down and killed the jedi order... he didn't say, darth vader killed a bunch of babies.  and as great as yoda's fight was... what's with him giving up?  wasn't he on luke's ass about giving up?  yet he basically goes, ""well, i'm gonna go hang out in a swamp now, catch you guys on the flip flop.""
i just don't think the prequels should have ever been made.  now they just distract from his previous three good movies... and in my opinion, makes them all a little crappier.  now episode III wasn't lousy, but please let's not call it good."

"event","the prom party went off without a hitch.  a good time was had by all.  and yes, my shirt did come off at one point.  that's got to be gauge on whether a party was hot or not... if a shirt comes off.  and i guess the thing to have is picture of me tweaking my nipples (i hear they're on ebay).  oh well, how many retro 80's prom parties do you go to?  if the answer is more than one, then perhaps you're more messed up than me :P"

"event","so, denise graduated this weekend.  SAIC has the worst graduation ever... so boring.  i just wanted to shoot myself the whole time.  the speakers were lame, they just talked on and on and on... no one tried to be witty or anything.  the graduates were even worse though, most of them were all artsy kids crying out for attention, so each one of them had to do like a special walk to get their diploma, it took like 10 minutes per kid.  it was so bad, i don't even want to go to mine next year.

i also met her parents, which was ok.  they seem like good people, and they took me out to eat, and you can't not like that."

"event","i don't know if anyone is considered with the state of cracker jack besides me.  i mean, they used to have some really great little plastic prizes.  like compasses and rings and shit like that.  those were some good prizes.  now it's all paper... tattoos and worse.  i mean the occasional tattoo is great, but now like the tattoo is the BIG prize.  the last crack jack prize i got was a paper pencil caddy.  it was a little piece of paper with a cut out slit for your pencil.  how cheap is that.  i mean i know they're saving money with the paper prizes but how much could the plastic crap possible cost?  my point is i'm more than willing to pay the extra 20 cents or so for a piece of plastic.  so, if any cracker jack execs are reading this, please, bring back the good prizes.

in other news, my semester is over and i'm off for the summer.  i think a girl for one of my classes was sort of hitting on me.  like she wanted to read my novel in the worst possible way... maybe, she wasn't ""hitting on me"" hitting on me, but i do think talent can be a powerful aphrodisiac.  she's married and all, but i really got a vibe that she wanted more than just a reading... maybe, just friendship or whatever.  still even though things with denise are great, i do ejoy when a girl shows me some attention.  now i have a whole summer ahead of me... and i need it.

later gators."

"event","so, i was thinking about skipping my film class last night, but i'm glad i didn't.  It was performance video of this guy David Kodeski.  it was spoken word/monolouge stuff, and i really liked.  i liked it so much i'd love to do a monolouge myself.  now if only i didn't have to speak or have people look at me... that's really the only thing i have a problem with.

i helped denise set up for her exhibition today, it looks real swell kiddos, simply swell... that's right, i'm saying swell now.  pass it along, i think it might catch on."

"event","i don't really have much to update, i just wanted to skeet a little bit, hope i didn't muss you up too much.

saw a wes anderson double feature this weekend: life aquatic and royal tenenbaums.  i love wes anderson movies, he makes the movies of books i would have liked to have written, if that makes any sense at all.  i liked life aquatic much more the second time, it really has it's charms.

the semester is almost over, just a couple weeks and of course the crit panel.  where a group of professors get together and take a collective dump on your work.  last time it went all right, this time i don't know.  oh well.  we'll see. 

well, i just got back from film class... and now it's smallville time!  oh clark... he's so dreamy.  skeet, skeet, skeet.  (and yes, i just learned what it meant)"

"event","you know, i'm a big fan of these judge shows.  it's like the litigates go straight from the COPS set to the judge show set.  i like the people's court and judge mathis... those are the best two without a doubt.  now marilyn milian is your runofthemill sassy red head judge.  although what's interesting about her is that she's cuban, and her latin blood starts to boil to the show.  you can actually see it it simmering throughout.
judge mathis though is more interesting... and why you ask?  because of the homo erotic relationship between him and his skinny white bailiff, doyle.  there's a lot of awkward katie couric flirting going on between the two of them. but in this country their love is still a love not spoken.  of course all that potent sexual tension goes into good judgin', but i imagine after a hard day... some difficult cases... that the two of them retreat to the judge's chambers for a nice long snuggle.  that's when judge mathis lets his guard down and cries a little, and he whispers, ""just hold me, doyle.  just hold me.""  that's what i imagine at least."

"event","so fist black mamba knocked my glasses off the dresser.  no big deal, cat's knock things off dressers, it's what they do--they're cats.  but next she's meowing all night, but not just meowing... she is going to town celine deon style, banging her chest and everything.  this goes on for like a half hour.  finally i get up to get my ear plugs, and what i do i hear... CRUNCH.  i broke my glasses in two.
i have a spare pair (they're almost identical style wise and prescription), but it's just not the same.  i really liked my new pair.  bastard cats.  the lesson?  if anyone ever tries to give you a cat, just say no."

"event","so i saw ringu the other day (yes, i know... i just got around to seeing it) because EVERYONE said it was SO much better than the remake.  wrong... dead wrong.  not only was it not better than the hollywood remake, it was barely watchable (really the only reason it was watchable at all was because it was only an hour long and i knew the end was coming).  just terrible... and boo to all you who told me it was good.  i think you're just being pretentious.  just ass kissing japanese snobbery.  there i said it, and it feels good.
the ring had a better story, better effects, better acting, and no psychic detectives.  i know there are some of you that want more psychics in movies... but i want less.  and yes, ringu was first, but so what, that doesn't make up for all it's crappiness."

"event","apparently on a train from dc to new york, my sister, becky, saw someone who looked just like me.  so much so that she was convinced that it was me.  and that i was secretly in new york doing some sort of undercover mission.  he walked like me, he dressed like me, had glasses like me... must be me.
now my parents haven't called me once in 4 years, the entire time i've lived in chicago.  zero times... they've never called.  my mom's afraid of phones and my dad has better things to do than call me.  and of course the one time they do call, i'm not home.  i spent the weekend at denise's.  i came home to like 8 messages on the answering machine.  they totally thought they busted me in new york.

but they even called my neighbor, and because i wasn't home, everyone thought i killed myself or something.  so in short, i'm not dead, i'm not in new york, i am behind in my work though.  entirely too much drinking saturday night."

"event","Right now my leg is PAIN FREE from the nerve block*! YEAH*&nbsp;
After the nerve block my migrains started to come back!
I stayed in bed for a week and didn't barely come out of my room except for the bathroom and food*!
I went back to my neurologist and he up my Cymbalta and gave me somthing else for emergencies!

I absolutly love my doctor he&nbsp; is very good and helpful!! He understands what I have been going through for the past 3 years. He always tells me that he doesn't want to hurt me more then I already hurt, so, instead of doing the nerve block while i'm awake he puts me completely out so I don't stress myself!!!</font>&nbsp;<br /><br /><font size=""3"">I didn't get to drive there because 1) We had my 2 year old niece with us and i'm a new driver and 2) I am only aloud to have 1 person and an other in the car with me while I have my permit!!!<br /><br />I am going to go lay down because I didn't sleep all of my meds off, so, i'll probally fall asleep!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Then i'm going to try to do some math homework!!!<br /><br />Love all,<br />Ashley Nicole</font>"

I am in a wheel chair when going out. I can manage to walk room to room. I have been taking alot of naps. Yesturday my mom, Katie, Jordyn and I went to khols, Target, and went out to lunch to pizza hut by the time we were done I was&nbsp;so exhausted that when I got home I passed out in my clothes and everything I was wearing. I am just trying to hang in there till my pain management appointment on the 14th.&nbsp;

I know that the worst thing for RSD is putting it in splints and everything but when I walk&nbsp;it feels unstable. So, a brace would stablize it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctors were the same ones I had a few weeks ago when I went to the hospital for my arm. They are very nice and understanding and did the best they could for me and didn't judge me! I can't get an appointment with my pain management doctor until&nbsp;April 14th till then&nbsp;I will be in a wheel chair going to the stores and everything. My arm is doing good since it is getting warmer outside. Well I will update more later. Love, Ashley</font>&nbsp;"

So, Heather's boyfriend who is an EMT told us to call the police station and have them send out an ambulance to the house. So, we were on the way home and the ambulance station is right by our house so we stopped there and they followed us home and put me in this special chair and got me upstairs.

I can't take not sleeping anymore. You would think it would catch up to you after awhile but it hasn't. 

My leg is only getting worse and now that it is cold out I can't get outside and my arm and side hurts worse. My leg is not yet sensitive to anything (it feels better to rub it) and hopefully it stays that way! 

I am just getting over being sick. That was the first time with RSD that I got sick like that. I am still cough just alittle.

I am now baby sitting Jordyn 4 days a week so my mom can go to work.

I had an orthodontist appointment today and he put chains and other things in my mouth but that isn't bad and doesn't hurt.

December 3rd I have an appointment with a doctor I went to in the begining of when my RSD started. He couldn't do anything because I didn't have any physical therapy but now I have had it, So, hopefully he will help and if not then we will probally be going to Boston.

My social skills are so0o horrible. I was doing good (there was about 8 kids) until the group doubled its size. Then I just completely freaked and got scared. So, we came home and I just broke down in tears! I just feel so0o alone! I want to meet new people and make new friends that know what I am going through but I don't know how to!

I am in so much pain it is unbelieveable. I slammed my bad arms finger in the bathroom door! So, that is swollen and hurts!

"event","Well yesturday was a rough day.

First we had to go to the doctors which he said I just pulled ligaments and muscles that I have to do 2 weeks of physical therapy.

Then after we had to rush bear to the animal hospital because monday night we saw he had these&nbsp;2 puncture&nbsp;wounds one his front upper leg and&nbsp;one on his groin area. My dad made a vet appointment but they couldn't get him in until 10:30 today. Well when we got home from the doctors there was blood all over the kitchen(it looked like someone was murdered) so, my dad called back the vet and said that he was literly bleeding to death so, they said to bring him in. Well, all they could to for now was give us an antibiotic and pain meds to keep him comfortable till it will stop bleeding.(they would not give him stiches because they could cause more problems on a dog his size(He is 3 pounds). He is still bleeding pritty bad but it is starting to slow down!

Tomarrow I start physical therapy at 1:00. ughh. I hate physical therapy. ""I think I did my share.""

I will update you later on Bear and physical therapy.!"

So, now I thought I had no friends to begin with now I really have NONE. I know I have friends on the internet to talk to but it is not the same as people coming to the house to visit! It is so hard for me to make friends because 1. I have RSD and trying to explain to them what that is, is very hard for meand they don't understand and get freaked out because of it&nbsp;,and, &nbsp;2. I had a hard time making friends with people to begin with because I am very shy. All I want is for 1 friend that lives close to me that is home all day that I can hang out with.</font>"

But when I woke up at 2:00 my ankles were killing me for some reason and they are still hurting but not as bad!

The weirdest thing happened today my sister called me upstairs and told me my neighbor was over talking to my mom and he said earlier this morning he was diagnosed with RSD. What a weird world we live in?

"event","Why do people do the things they do? Im saying that there has 2 be a reason why people do stuff. EVERYTHING happens for a reason. why do people get drunk, and and say stuff, they dont mean, or do things they dont mean 2 do. Why do people lie about stuff? There has to be a reason..mostly to impress people, or so sum one wont find out. I hate that every one around me lies, or tires too hard. Why cant people be them selves, and who gives a shit about what any one else thinks. Why do people get high? Its pointless, but what gets me the most is when i just sit here and think about how people mess up over and over again..especially the ones i care about. This worls sux, but i try to make the best of it, and try not to get mad at dumb things, and try to always keep a smile on my face, but when things go the wrong way u cant help but cry.."

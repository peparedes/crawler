"event","Omgosh, what bad news should i start with? I'll jus start with this. Me and my Seceret (kyle Lyons) started going out yesturday. I got all excited then Janelle got mad at me. It was a bad fight, i always yell at her when she tries to tell me whats right. Well she was right some-what. Anyways, I dont really want to get into the fight thingy. So yeah me and Kyle were going out! Well i say ""were"" cuz He broke up with me. I went to Bed cuz ya know summer school, n then i guess he told Hannah to tell me that i'm dump. So Janelle told me this morning..So i'm single. Then another thing that happend is Samantha Dobson and Brandon Dickens got into a car accident. Samantha died, and Brandon is in a comma..isnt that the most horrible thing ever? Then something else jus happend. Kyle's baby might be Dead..Why is everything colliding, and fucking up?! God its so stupid. Then i talked to Kyle and Asked him why he broke up with me, and he told me he had his reasons. I mean god..its so messed up. I jus dont know what to say anymore.

 

I Love You Kyle"

"event","Wow..Okay..so this is all confusing for me. I switch guys so much and i need to stop. Well I found out scotty don't even like me. So i supposed i moved on? if you wanna call it that? Well Anyways, Austin called Janelle asking her to go to the movies, so i was ok..lol and Kyle Osborn wanted to see me again, so we all like went to the movies. lol it was fun, it was like idk..weird cuz Whenever Austin and Janelle go to the movies they are going out..and now they're friends..which is cute lol. But anyways..Yeah..me and Kyle ended up holding hands and he told me he liekd me..so i was like thats cute. lol. But then we all got home and he called me and asked me out. Its weird cuz it seems like i'm moving on from guy to guy and UGH i hate it. So anyways Janelle told me to tell him yeah..so we are going out now. I'm happy cuz we always wanted to go out..but i'm sad cuz I dont kno who i like. So i guess i need to stop..even tho i have a seceret. Kyle Lyons <-- my seceret..i've always liked him and he asked me out yesturday and i told him idk..so now i cant tell him yeah cuz i'm going out with the other kyle..and its horrible. What should i do? 
  Well another major thing happend..I guess someone told Aaron some rediculas story about Janelle kissing some random guy which is totally not true..Anyways..so Now aaron is all mad at janelle and he wont effin believe her that its not true, then he is saying she lied..so i dont kno. And even if she did cheat..if she wanted to be that stupid..Aaron cheated on Janelle..and it was so horrible for janelle..and i still cant believe she took him back..o-well. He's being a Jerk. 

Well I'm gonna go Help Janelle with her issues..lol Jk i love you Janelle

"event","Thursday-..Well i went to summer school, it was fun. But then..when it got over i waited and waited for my lazy sister to come get me. Well she never showed up..so then i was waiting for my dad..or somebody to jus..come get me. I was there for a half hour..so i was like well screw this..and i walked all the way home from the high school!! it was horrible. I got home at 1:00 and Summer school ended at 11:20! It was aweful..so then my sister woke up and i was like hey hannah..i jus walked all the way home, and she started crying haha and saying sorry. It was really funny. Later that day i was bored..and janelle went to church w/Aaron and Alica, and Lisa, and idk who else..so I didnt have anything to do...so i was like ..pfsh..i'm going shopping. So me, Hannah, Michelle, and Ashley all went to the Mall..it was so fun. Me and Michelle got hit-on so many times by ugly guys..nah jus kidding..they were hott. One time..we walked outa Pac-Sun, and Two guys that were selling stuff in the hall stopped us. They wouldn't stop saying how beautiful i was...i jus sat there like ..ew i'm ugly. So anyways..I told them to stop saying im pretty jus so i can buy shit from them and they said that they arnt bribing me, they really think i'm pretty. So then they asked me for my name ..and i was just like..Heather, and the one guy was like oooh my god...how gorgous..so i was like so what do thease necklaces look like ((cuz they were selling jewlery with names on them)) so they showed me and i was like thats sooo cool..and they were like so you wanna buy one, i'll sell one to you for 10$ ..so i was jus like..ahh i gotta go. lol It was fun. So that was Basically my Day..lol

Friday- When i got out of summer school, i had a ride lol. My dad picked me and Jenny up, and then me and her went to her house to hang out. We havnt hung out forever. lol. Well anyways, it was really fun. She told me about this guy, Justin, who shes totally obsessed over. And its really sad too, cuz he wont give her a chance. I feel bad for her tho. But then we jus played Tony Hawk's underground lol, well she played it lol. And we listened to ""her music""..but i liked it, so now shes burning me cd's lol. Well i only hung out with her for like 2 hours. Well i went home and got online. Then i kinda finished planning my night. But ..nothing really turned out as planned. I wanted Janelle to come over early..but she of course was with Aaron, but i can understand that. And Kenny couldnt go to the movies w/me..so i was by my little self again. But then it was cool cuz Janelle spent the night. lol. We went 4-weeling, but then we ran outa gas..and it was funny. So then we jus chilled online. lol. Then we watched movies..and idk..had fun lol.

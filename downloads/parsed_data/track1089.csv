"event","hey...Today is a pretty boring Tuesday, as always.  We had some more fitness testing in gym today.  Which I am really mad at myself for.  Last time I got 18 pull-ups, but this time i only got 11(ARG!!).  For my sit-ups, I got 71, which is good, better than last time.  Yesterday, Monday, was okay... We had a basketball game in Ramsey, which we lost (arg, again).  I barely played at all.  Then i came home, took a shower, watched TV(csi:miami), then went to bed!(thankfully).  Sunday, was fun.  I went out sledding with my family for a little while.  Then came home, watched the superbowl(boring).  Then watched survivor:all-stars, which was better than the superbowl(lol).  Well, thats it for now, tell u more later! bye -Kelly"

"event","I know, I know!!! I didn't write in a while...sorry! Okay, we had no school last monday which was cool...umm i don't remember what i did that day though... OOHHH yeah lol i went skiing with my sister and my dad.  It was soooo extremely cold at the top of the mountain, omg.  Then i came home and got warm, finally.  Then i watched American Idol...wow i can't believe some of those people think they can sing!?  Anyway, the next day i think i had basketball because i missed american idol.  Then, on wednesday was boring, we had mid-terms for science and french.  They weren't as bad as i thought they were going to be.  Then i watched the O.C. which was really good.  The coming attactions were really suspensful and i have to wait 3 weeks to find out what happens!! *arg* Then thursday was okay, just studing for the mid-terms on friday, history and pre-algebra.  Friday, of course, i was sick.  I missed the mid-terms, and the class pictures.  The weekend wasn't good either because i was still sick but sunday was a little better.  Then on monday i came to school.  It was an okay day.  It was kinda annoying because everyone was talking about mid-terms(the ones i hadn't taken yet).  Today wasn't a bad day i had to make-up the math and history exams though which was okay.  I was done by the end of third period *thankfully!*  We are supposed to get some snow tonight but who knows how much cuz they change it every minute, just about!!  I hope it is a lot so there is no school, but whatever, i wouldn't mind if there is, suprizingly i really don't hate school that much so w/e.  And now im sitting in my basement freezing...*brrr* well bye bye for now! -kelly xo*xo    AHH SOO BORED!"

Tthey were throwing popcorn at everyone!(poor john...lol) I liked all of the effects and the scenery though. After that i played basketball with some good friends-John, Brianne, and Chien that was fun(lol)! then after that i went to the dance...we met at mickey house then walked over, and before everyone came it was just me and michelle and we got freaked out by this quiet beeping noise(lol...it was a car alarm but we didn't find that out till later.) Then at the dance, wow that was umm an ""interesting"" dance.  I danced with John twice---i was really really shocked, but happy. And saturday was ""okay"" we went to go get a christmas tree(i know like 5 days before x-mas...were not that smart) but we found one! and now it is sunday(another boring one) school tomorrow and still have to do homework and im not feeling too well!...ta ta for now!

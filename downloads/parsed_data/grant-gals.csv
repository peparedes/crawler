"event","Yeah so today marks one month since My family and i lost someone close to us.  For you guys who are just tunning in. On October 9th and 10th, our friend Daimien commited suicide. I have never felt a pain like this in my life and i hurts so bad. Daimien was an awsome person and there isn't a memory I don't have that he isn't smiling. He was so full of life and always would hepl in anyway possible. His brother Jamie comes to our house practiclly ever night to talk to my dad about hting s and ask advice about what to do with Daimien's stuff. I don't know about you but it scares the shit out of me to see a grown man cry. I hate everything that has to do with suicide and i can't watch thing that have guns in it (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASACRE). 

   So besides that whole thing my da was pretty good.  I am gettin my braces off in a couple of months YAYAY!!! Audrey is spending the night tonight and we are going to crossgates tomarrow to pick out stuff for the Famous perosn's thing! OH man I am so HHHUUUNGREEEEYYY! Dieting sucks Butt! O well talk to you all later!"

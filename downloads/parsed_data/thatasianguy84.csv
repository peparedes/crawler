"event","Waiting for World of WarCraft to patch itself with a minor patch so I figured i'd post here.

Been working, spending time with my g/f and playing a bit of WoW here and there.  My Guild is gonna expand into the next server that opens up that is a RP server so hopefully we can get a low population server.  

If anyone cares to join the guild when we expand you're free to do so, we have an Alliance guild on Argent Dawn and we will have a Horde guild on the one that opens up so let me know and I can get you hooked up."

"event","So I feel about 80% ready to take over the job of the mighty Nate at work.  And I only feel that way when there is another person to watch over me while I do it so more like 60% when you take an actual MOD away.

Sleepy. Gonna throttle Ben for thinking of even making me use stickers...bastard hehe."

"event","Well this is my first post in my ""Journal"" so we'll see how it goes.

Not much to say right now, been playing lots of games lately and rented Drakengard today so we'll see how this goes.  Gonna watch War of the Worlds and hopefully Batman Begins and Howl's Moving Castle.

Also the webpage that is listed in my profile is for my Guild Website for World of Warcraft. I have a 60 Paladin on Argent Dawn and I am the leader of my Guild."

"event","koori-chaa~n, i am still unable to comprehend how that file-splitting program works - i tried it out and managed to split a file successfully but alas, I can't play them *dejected* Did i do something wrong? curses! Why didn't this program come with a detailed tutorial? Help.

On other news, final year exams are approaching. The tension, anxiety and fear is draining me. Slowly and surely. Will I survive the oncoming months? Answer: Negative."

"event","<u>Bad thing(s) that happened today</u>

The sudden and unpleasant discovery of strange markings and whatnot on the underside of my CD (that stores episodes of one of my favourite animes) and thus rendering it un-playable. curses. This prompted an immediate action of rectification ie. re-downloading the said episodes. With reference to a guidebook, it wrote the following: To clean the underside of a disc, use only a non-abrasive cloth and non-abrasive solution (what?). Non-abrasive cloth? Gyah! How troublesome. It got me thinking: Can tissues be used as an alternative to a ""non-abrasive"" cloth? *wonders*"

"event","*yawn* finished watching the first few episodes of ""scryed"" - ho hum, losing interest, not sure if im gonna continue watching though i'll give it a few more episodes before i reserve judgement. seeding ""scryed"" at the moment to bring up my download/upload ratio. also finished watching ""KKM"" till th lastest subbed release. all i can say is - <3 yuuri's onii-chan (too bad he only appears in one episode; ep 40 something). hopefully, shori will appear again in later eps.

hm, now having trouble deciding what to watch next - something yaoi/shounen-ai i guess (blame ""KKM"") i can only think of ""gravitation"" and ""sukisyo"" - i lost the motivation to continue sukisyo after the first few episodes; i guess i wasnt fond of the character designs. ne koori, any ideas? (you must have watched loads of anime of this genre)

My favourites (complete)

Azumanga Daioh - humor, humor and more humor, one of the funniest animes ever 
Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan - the main char's numerous facial expressions are just too hilarious for words
Chobits - i want a persocom too!
Chrno Crusade - one of the chars is voiced by Mingawa Junko (yay)
Elfen Lied - full of blood, nudity and angst, highly recommended, the op theme is simply ...beautiful
Fullmetal Alchemist - <3 most of the chars and the op and ending themes
Getbackers - subtle shounen-ai hints everywhere (if you know where to look)
Midori no Hibi - weird; i still cant grasp the concept of a person replacing the hand of another 
Rozen Maiden - great character designs, great music
Samurai Deeper Kyo - absolutely <3 the opening theme and the main character is just so lovable 
Samurai Champloo - strange characters but i <3 them all the same
Shaman King - the main char is such lazy bum but i <3 him anyways; twincest anyone? 
Soukyuu no Fafner - tear-jerking, beautiful music, memorable characters, recommended

ne koori, just curious - what are your favourites?"

"event","wow. more than 2 LJ posts on the same day? i must have loads of free time - that or im merely procrasting the need to study for upcoming mocks >.>; oh well. that's what i should be doing - STUDY. but instead im playing with my LJ and downloading animes. hopeless. 

question - what is the average size of a hamster's privates? anwer - unknown
i swear, there's something very wrong with my sister's male hamster. its privates are freakishly engorged / swollen. it looks like that damn hamster has a constant boner >.> truly, im speechless. ive been trying to convince my family that that hamster should pay a little visit to the neighbourhood vet - but so far, they're firmly resisting my attempts. ashamed much? <.<; more info on that lech hamster later.

anyway, im downloading ""mai hime"" at the moment. Will be watching ""scryed"" now. sore ja"

"event","*teary-eyed* ...koori, you were right. it really was worth watching SnF to the very end - no matter how bittersweet the end is. now i really cant wait for SnF II. but im confused - will the sequel be another tv series or an OVA instead? and do you know when the sequel will be subbed and released? 

*nod* yes, i firmly believe kazuki and soushi will meet once again. their LOVE shall prevail *weep*"

"event","LJ Update - removed several colourbars (bio was getting a little crowded), edited my interest list, change the general layout and colour scheme of LJ (though it doesnt seem to differ from the previous one >.> -except for the colour), ah -finally named my previously nameless LJ (i think the name is quite apt), deleted all my old entries, changed my mood icon

I have yet to watch the remaining 2 episodes of Soukyuu no Fafner. I feel reluctant to do so because i'm pretty sure there wont be a happy ending. And this will inevitably make me depressed. >.> Im still waiting for the sequel though, am also waiting for FMA movie to be subbed and available (i heard that it should be released around december?)

*gritty-eyed* oh well, past 3am here. And i have morning classes today/tomorrow. <.< I really must stop this habit of going to bed in the wee hours of the night. *yawn* sore ja.

p.s - ne Koori, have you noticed -PoT is just an episode away from being completed. Yay."

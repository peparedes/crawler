"event","Today is December 7, the 64th anniversiary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor. What most people don't realize, or selectivly choose to forget is that most Japanese auto makers were in the business of making Japanese warplanes that bombed Pearl Harbor, and killed Americans throughout the war. The most prominent of these was Mistubishi, mkaer of the Zero. Thats right, if you drive a Japanese car YOU SUPPORT THE BOMBING PEARL HARBOR, and YOU HATE AMERICA. So do the American thing, and burn you Japanese car. USA MOTHER$%^&*#



The above bit is just in jest, the Japnese have become one of America's greatest allies, but still you should never forget to remember what happened 64 years ago. So take time today to remember those who gave thier lives on this day so you wouldn't have to grow up speaking Japanese, Italian, or German."

<P>Yeah I get bored, so I find the most inane stuff there is to find on Al Gore's most wonderful invention known as the internet. So anyway, according to the article above, foil helmets will not protect you from supposed government controlled radio waves. The study shows the foil actually AMPLIFIES invasive radio waves. So now a whole bunch of conspiricay theorists who belive the government invade their minds with radio waves/satellites heave done nothing but to help transmisions enter their heads. I'm not saying I believe in the theory that the government invades peoples minds, but this article proves that all the conspiracy theorists are complete idiots.</P>"

"event","Well today was Columbus day, or if you are Canadian it was thanksgiving. Why do we only celebrate columbus day, The Continent of North America was discovered by Leif Erikson, and he was a viking. Columbus was just a lame Italian navigator, who sailed under the Spanish Flag, and like all fashionable males of the Renaisance wore riduclous pataloons. Vikings on the other hand pillaged Europe from Britain to Constantinople, and ran around with battle axes killing people because they felt like it. They were better seamen than anybody of their day, and sailed to America the hard way, through the north Atlantic which is filled with icebergs. Face it Columbus was a pansy compared to Lief Erikson. We should be celebrating his day instead of Columbus (who got lost on his way to China, smooth move). So write your congressman, riot in the streets, and demand we celebrate the accomplishments of a real man, not some fancy pants looser who cant find Asia on a map."

College life is great and all, but  I have a strange feeling I am not going anywhere with my life though. I have been thinking a lot about enlisting and going to Iraq. I want to do something with my life, and be a part of history. I suppourt the war to a certain extent, and feel It is my obligation to put up or shut up. Other people are over there putting their life on the line for me and the rest of America, maybe it is my time to do the same.

My grandparents were nice enough to give me $450 for this semester to spend, and well after today I have enogh of that left to eat at Taco bell. Apparantly it's really cool to make each student buy 5 textbooks for a class, all of them printed brand new so you can't get used ones. Probably I'll get $10 back at the end of the semester, because a new edition of all my books just came out that had a total of two sentences changed in it, and a new picture on the cover.

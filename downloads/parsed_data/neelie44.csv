Okay so ive procrastinated for weeks and weeks.. Now I have a shit load of work and studying to do for school.. I need to write two essays.. an essay for each of my humanities classes.. Two research papers.. one for sociology and another for humanities.. I need to do like 8 chapters of sociology notes.. I need to study for my CIS and humanities final.. I need to prepare for a presentation for sociology and a presentation for humanities.. Damn I have soo much to do.. And what am I doing? Journaling.. haha no good! I really need to get off the internet and get back to work now.. Gosh the internet is soo distracting! Its no good for me.. I sign online and then I hear sounds of people signing on and off and it distracts me and I keep checking.. Then I start visiting websites to check stuff out and it takes me away from getting my work done too.. Just like right now for example I am on here and should be working.. Also a big distraction is myspace! I go on there waaaay too much.. Im a freakin mySPACE cadet! I thought about deleting my account but decided not too cuz im almost done with school anyway.. I only have 9 more days till I graduate! Yeah Boy! I can't wait! =) BACK TO WORK foreals this time!"

Why am I sooo freakin emotional??? Ughh.. I freakin hate it.. The littlest things get to me! My eyes are tired of it.. Why can't I just hold it all back? Im tired of all the drama.. Im tired of fighting.. shit thats all thats seems to be going on these past few days.. I gotta stop being soo stubborn and freakin just let things go sometimes.. I gotta learn to stop instead of keep going on and on and on.. that goes nowhere.. But fuck, I need to voice out my opinions and how i feel about things.. But whatever.. Unless things are really bigger than they are imma just keep my mouth shut and let things go.. I can't let bullshit get to me since i ALWAYS seem to be at fault for everything anyways.. I shall start today.. La la la.. I hope my night is good and doesn't turn out to be another shitty one!"

classmate, ""What is it like to be a Christian?""

The 10 year old little girl replied ""It is like

being a pumpkin. God  picks you from the patch, brings 

you in, and washes all the dirt off you. Then he cuts open 

the top and scoops out all the yucky stuff. He removes the 

seeds of doubt, hate, greed, etc., and then He carves you a  

new smiling face and puts His light inside of you to shine 

for all the  world to see."""

1. I love you not because of who you are, but because of who I am when I am with you. 

2. No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry. 

3. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have. 

4. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart. 

5. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them. 

6. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile. 

7. To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world. 

8. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you. 

9. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful. 

10.. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened. 

11. There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around. 

12. Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you. 

13. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to. 

REMEMBER: WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON."

"event","<font color = blue>So yeah.. I went out Thursday night.. I went to the block with Krista and Laura.. We went to Alcatraz and met up with Jessica and some co-workers.. So we were chillen drinking and some guys walk in and come where we were by the bar..and are like all up in our area.. It was soo not appreciated! This one guy was like ""whats up ladies"" like all up in my face.. I was like backing up like WHOA! He was all trying to say HI about it and shaking my hand and then he bust out with this ""yeah I just got out of prison"" I was thinking.. OHhh shoot! Sorry to hear about it.. but he did look like it.. with his wife beater and a bunch of tatoos.. haha but they were soooo on attack mode.. Like no other.. I was like seriously thinking.. Go Away and get up out of my face!! SO yeah.. Eventually they went away and went bowling.. So then we hung out there at Alcatraz for a little longer cuz two of Jess's co-workers were singing.. It was karaoke night.. and then we went to Dave and Busters and met up with Jessica's other friends.. So we are there and Laura sees some guy shes knows and starts talking to him.. And too bad they freakin wanted to talk about fitness the whole night.. We were so burnt out from the stupid conversation.. its cuz Laura is a fitness trainer and this guy works out at the gym she works at.. He was trying to get free tips from her and stuff.. He was cute though.. Anyways.. So Jessica finds her friends and me and Krista go with her.. To bad Jessica didn't introduced us.. but its all good cuz her friend came up to us and was introducing himself and talking to us and stuff.. He was coolio and yeah he was a cutie too.. haha.. Then after D&B's we went to Fridays.. Met back up with her co-workers.. I was tired by then and wanted to go home.. but we had to wait around cuz Laura(prostitute looking girl) was hooking up w/ Jess's co-worker.. They were kissing and stuff the rest of the night.. And the guy wanted to take her home and stuff.. He was kinda irritating.. Cuz he knew me, krista, and laura came together and we were parked on the other side of the block.. And he was gonna give Laura a ride to the other side and he said ""did you guys want a ride too?"" Krista was like ""wait what?"" then he played it off and said.. ""well yeah you guys all came together right"".. he was being stupid.. and just wanted a one on one with her in the car.. I was like ohhhhhhhhhhh k.. Everyone thought he was cute.. but i was like Uhhh no hes NOT cute.. He is too Fem!     

OKay.. I am sick of writing for now.. So Peace!"

"event","<font color=""9900FF"">Wow.. Today was a bad day for me.. Well up until I got home from school.. Started off by waking up late! So I was running wayy late.. I had to put my shoes, socks, and make-up on in the car.. I didn't even get to take a shower.. I had to brush my teeth and wash my face and do my hair real quick.. I felt like I was all dishoveled and a mess.. So the first thing I did when I got home was showered.. Now I feel so much better.. =)

So then I go to my first class feeling like shit.. I had a headache.. Felt like throwing up.. But had nothing to throw up.. I really didn't wanna sit there in my management class and listen to my professor talk about absolutely nothing.. She freakin rambles on and on about the same ish over and over.. Like we will have a whole chapter to go over and she will talk about one section for like 2 hours straight.. saying the same ish! Gets annoying.. So instead of sitting there for 2 hours.. I left at break and went to the lab for an hour to get some work done.. Then I was getting really freakin annoyed! I was printing out a bunch of crap for me and MWat.. For our lab and homework that was due today.. I printed like seriously a book.. It was a grip of papers... and some were wrong so I had to reprint the fixed ones.. I was getting annoyed cuz I was sitting there doing the work and MRob was helping me and freakin MWat is just sitting there the whole freakin time just watching.. She could have been getting the print outs and seperating them cuz I was printing her a copy too.. And the papers were getting all mixed up with the good ones we were gonna turn in and the screw ups.. But no.. she just sat there and was getting on my nerves.. I pretty sure she knew I was pissed cuz I kept  saying shit outloud.. And I was not in the mood for anyones crap.. I felt like shit.. Looked like shit.. and did NOT appreciate her not freakin helping! Then I finally finished all the work and went to get the print outs since MWat couldn't! But it was time to go to my next class.. SO then I had to take the freakin large stack that I printed and seperate it and figure what was good and what wasn't.. It took a little while.. but shoot this wouldn't have happened if some people could just help the F%#k out! Yeah.. I was PISSED! Shit.. Seriously.. I am helping you out here.. The least you can do is.. HELP ME HELP YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So I am in my next class pissed.. Seperating the papers and my professor hands me back my test I took last week.. Then I was more ticked off.. I did NOT appreciate that test at all! I freakin failed it like no other.. So I was freakin so burnt! I was suppose to be taking notes and I wasn't even doing that.. I was jotting misc. stuff down.. I didn't even care.. I was irritated to the MAX by everything and anything that came about! Even professors stupid jokes weren't making me laugh! I was falling asleep about it instead.. 

But yeah.. This Tri freakin sucks big time! I mean my grades are good for now.. But this is only the start of it so.. its fine.. I am just not in a real school mood I guess.. I didn't even go to class yesterday.. But its okay.. I got the stuff done.. But its like I get tired and start dozing off in class.. that is soo not good.. I need to stay awake and take notes and listen! I do but.. Shoot my eyes start closing on me.. It cuz the classes are later in the day.. I can't do afternoon classes.. They drain me out.. I been coming home and taking naps after school.."

<b>SMILE, GOD LOVES YOU!</b>
A smile is something nice to see; 
it doesn't cost a cent.
A smile is something all your own; 
it never can be spent.

A smile is welcome anywhere; 
it does away with frowns.
A smile is good for everyone to ease life's up and downs"

<b>IN CHRIST ALONE
<i>Adrienne Liesching and Geoff Moore</i></b>

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This conerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

Hmmmm.. Whats been going on lately...

Well... 4th of July the cops scared the crap out of me.. I was chillen at my neighbors with Josh on the comp since our keyboard wasn't working at the time.. I was checking some info for my cell phone out.. Then I decided to go back home.. So yeah.. I go back home and I cut through the grass.. And I see some cops up on my front entry way and on the porch.. I didn't expect anyone to be standing there.. So I got scared.. And the cops flashes the lights on me.. And this is how the conversation goes:

me: ""ohh shoot you scared me"" 
cops: ""no.. you are scaring everyone in your neighborhood.. lighting off fireworks"" 
me: ""what are you talking about? I was just chillen at my neighbors""
cops: ""well where do you live?""
me: ""right here""
cops: ""well go get someone inside thats doing this.. I got 2 calls that it was this house""
me: ""ok be back"" 

I went in and shut the door.. Since there were fireworks right in the entry way when you walk in my house.. The cops can see if the door was open.. So I told Alex really quick.. Then we moved the fireworks away from the entry way before he got the door. It took a few minutes and the cops were still waiting.. Hahaha they got mad.. They knocked at the door all hard.. So we were done moving the fireworks and Alex got the door and they said: ""we dont have all day you know"" and then Alex said something like.. ""I dont know man.. but there were kids running up and down this street setting off fireworks""

Anyways it was funny...



I had Monday off of work.. So I went down to the beach w/ my dad, volmir?, josh, beej, sarah... meg and cha met up later.. I tried surfing.. it was coolio.. I couldn't get up on the board though.. Josh kinda got up.. That was cool.. EWWWWWWW saw some black crack.. haha 


Anyways earlier today at work I heard something that really creeped me out.. I had the chills running down my body like crazy.. The freaky wiered guy (Efren or Al) that came and worked for one day... I guess he picked up andrew (another worker) from his house.. and Andrew has been missing since Monday.. Thats what his wife said.. She said some guy named Al picked him up and he hasn't returned since then..  Ewwww creepy.. I was like ewwwwwww thats sooo scary.. and I was pissed also cuz this guy Bruce from work said that freaky guy said I liked him and I was trying to take him to the movies.. Umm NOOOOOOOOOO! I was like ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh k thats soooooo burnt.. hes such a liar!!!!!!!!!!

But yeah.. I got a new phone today... Its soo coolio.. I am w/ verizon now.. Ohhh shooot movin on UP.. 

I'm tired and I gotta get up early tomorrow.. So I guess and I will do everyone a favor and go take a shower.. JK .. Shoot.. You know my ish don't stink! hahahaha"

Man o Man.. My freakin computer is acting up again! Someone spilled water in the keyboard now its not working.. Sucks how people dont even care.. I wasn't even home and I go up to my room and go to the comp and its not working.. I turn the keyboard over and all kinds of water comes out.. Its kinda irritating after a while when people keep messin up the computer.. If you dropped the water in the keyboard at least try to drain it before it gets all up in the situation.. So yeah now we need a new keyboard.. So right now I am at my neighbors chillen cuz im waiting to go out and check out the fireworks.. 

Anyways.. Today was pretty coolio.. I went to a family picnic.. I got to see some fam from up north and some from colorado.. So that was cool.. I got a little burnt.. I ate soo freakin much.. Eeeh! Everyone played softball but me and div just chilled.. I played with Mc Kenna, Katie, and Payton.. They are so cute.. It was fun.. We just rolled down the hill in the grass and then played tag..  

Went to Tower Records.. Bought a Fiji and another Hawaiian CD.. So tight! 

Well thats about it for now.. I will get back.. Gonna check the fireworks out.."

It wasn't my fault.. I square..haha.. I wasn't doing that job.. I'm pretty sure f<b>RED</b>die is getting fired tomorrow.. He messed up! He's been throwing labels away like no other.. Shoot you can't be doing that.. So I guess hes gettin the boot! ""John John"" wants him out! I was finally starting to get along with him today too.. haha.. He was zooming around all day though..

So yeah.. I finally got to the beach yesterday.. I skipped work.. PASLC!!! I said I wasn't feeling good.. But yeah.. I Got a little burnt(litterally).. I still need some more sun though.. The beach was fun.. It wasn't that warm though.. Body sufing was fun.. Catching the waves.. Oh yeah.. We saw a jelly fish too.. I can't even remember when the last time I went to the beach was.. I'm glad I finally went though.. It was fun.. I gotta get back there for sure.. I need some warmer weather though.. Gosh I wish I could surf.. That would be awesome.. Or even body boarding.. I get scared though.. Being out there by myself.. Sharks wanna know why.. haha

Ewww Sunday I went to Wallmart and some lady was on drugs like crazy.. She was freakin talkin to herself getting all mad and stuff.. and she kept on rubbing her face and stuff.. I noticed her when I was looking at the CD's I was like ""oh my... whats going on??"" Then I was looking at light bulbs for my lava lamp and she came down that section with me.. She was like getting mad and freakin kept moving around and throwing her hair back and forth.. I was scared.. I was like peace out.. I dont wanna be down this aisle with this freak.. She might start yelling at me or something for no reason.. No really though.. She scared me! AHHHHHH!

Anyways.. I need to cash my check! I want to go shopping!! I want to go to Melrose! Too bad we been busy with fixin up the house.. I been in a shopping mood lately.. I actually havn't been shopping in so long.. Probably cuz I never have money.. I need a devry check! Its been a while since I have had one of those.. At least I got some money from working.. 

Zoom Zoom Zoom.. Dudadadoot...(out of nowhere) Josh finally heard it..Hahaha.. That was too funny! We got the GOOgles (Goo-Gone) Like Crazy.. haha 
Kimiko finally heard it too! We talked about it and lunch today to see if she has ever heard it and she said ""no"" .. So we were working in the warehouse and all of the sudden out of nowhere.. ""Dudadadoot"" We were crackin up! 

Well this is it for now.. I'm tired.. I have to be at work at 7:30 cuz of some screw ups! So I gotta get up early.. So peace out.. Gotta catch some ZZZZzzzz's"

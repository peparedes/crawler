"event","Holy hell, I haven't updated this journal since <i>March</i>- I- wow. I'd like to offer my neglected flist a mea culpa; life's been beyond crazy and all sort of things have fallen off the to-do list. Having said that, summer is finally here bringing with it the lovely promise of heat waves and books to read. Ah, yes, that magic word: books. Thanks to spring quater's comparative lit. class, I've got the stangest yen for science fiction books. 

Yes, you did read that correctly; I'm reading sci fi. Actually, I'm reading pretty damn good sci fi. <i>Solaris</i> by Stanislaw Lem, the novel, not the film, is an excellent novel. I'll come back and write a full review of it later this week, but briefly: the novel is really hard to pin down to any specific theme or meaning but works on a couple different levels. As a quick, light read, summer read, it's not really a great choice. But it's still enjoyable even without pouring hours into trying to decipher the symbolism of the ""ocean."" And if you are one of those types who likes to poke and prod and examine every nuance of a book? This is a <i>fantastic</i> novel for that kind of examining. 

And now, I think I'm going to go back to poking and examing and maybe-- just maybe, getting some writing done."

"event","So, I found this on my f-list and thought I'd try it. This is a thirty drabble/ficlet meme. Pick a number and I will write something between 100 and 300 words of the character or pairing of your choice. I'll do the best I can.

"event","<lj cut text=""So silly of me to think I wouldn't be back.""> I was seriously tempted to delete this journal, just fall off the face of the earth and never look back. I should have realized it just wasn't in the cards. So here I am, back again and trying to smile. Of course, should I suceed it might unravel the fabric of the universe so... we'll just work on not permanently disfiguring the little idiot sitting next to me who keeps sneaking glances my way. ::sighs:: I knew I should never have hacked off the talons.</lj cut> 

Yesterday was rather touch and go, all things considered. My relaxing bath turned into a breakdown and my razor was annoyingly dull. I really hate the Venus blades. ::pouts:: But, maybe its a good thing. Got it all out of my system. Maybe. ::sighs:: Whatever. 

Anyway, going to go see P & P today. I still maintain, quite adamantly, that Colin Firth <i>is</i> Mr. Darcy and any remake of the BBC mini-series is absolute folly. ::grump:: But, having said that, I still want to see version, even if what I've seen of the casting has left me cold. 

Stayed up way too late last night watching the <b>Brokeback Mountain</b> special on VH1. The movie is going to be amazing, I wish I was going to see it today but alas... off to watch Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet. ::headdesk:: Oh well. I'm seeing my movie next week for my birthday, so its not all misery. Although, if little Ms. 'Well Nikki was screaming about it so I want to go see it even though I don't know a thing about,' goes to see it and pings me again we may have a problem."

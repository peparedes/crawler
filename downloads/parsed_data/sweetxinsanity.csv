"event","yup. 
thats me right now. 
that fat pink thing...

my right eye has been twitching everyday since my car accident. 
no joke. it really has been.

and ive had several driving dreams. 
some where im driving bad. and some where im driving good, but i get really nervous cause i have to complete like these obscene obsticles with my car. such as a really narrow tunnel. then escalators...???

i dont kno. 
i just miss my car and being able to drive. 
its such an amazing privledge to have, and then to have it taken away from you is the worst thing in the world.


the first quarter of senior year is over. 
so fast. 
just three more and im out of here for good. 
nahh. ill be back. 
i'll only be in the city at Parsons. HOPEFULLY!!
if not. perhaps new paltz? with justine!? thatd be amazing. 
too bad i love her and wed be the most awesome roomates ALIVEEEEEE. 

in PIG we're watching farenheit 9/11 and we got to the part where they show footage of us bombing Iraq for the first time in march of 2003. 
and i just got to thinking about what exactly i was doing that day. and i remember it so well. 
andrew was over my house and i think it was after school one day. and when i turned on the tv thats all i saw on the news channels and we just sat and watched. and talked about what it would be like in the months to come. and if there was a draft. 

and i also remember not understanding why we bombed them. 
and i still really dont. 
and i hate this whole war. 


a friend who i havent talked to in quite a while because i thought they wanted to rip my guts out and burn me alive talked to me today.
and i was quite shocked. 
and we talked about old times. 
and i realized how much i miss that too. :-/




erika hates change. 
and not sleeping after school. 
and monica loves it when erika talks in the third person. :)

no school tomorrow. 
horray. <3"

"event","man oh man.

so as some of you know, i was in a really bad car crash last thursday.
someone drove into my drivers side. 
the cars totaled.
but surprisingly im fine. 
i dont kno how, but all i got was some whiplash and an achey body. 
funny how things work out. :-/

and...while my car was in custody of the towing company, some assholes decided to go in there and steal my sterio and cd's....<b>AGAIN</b>!!!!!
awesome right?
and the assholes at the towning company wont even give me back enough money for it. only like half of what my sterio cost. 
he said its the same as if my car was sitting in the street. 
-umm no i dont think it is. 
first of all my car was your responsibility, you towed it and are being paid to watch and take care of it. if it was just on the street, my windows wouldnt have been blown open and my doors unlocked. 
not to mention, i dont understand how you dont expect things like this when your oh so wonderful barbed wire gate has a 12 inch gap between it and the ground that the fattest person alive could crawl under. plus your gate and yard are shit in the first place.

so that pissed me off very much so.
but i hope justine is correct in saying that things happen in threes, cuase then maybe all my car trouble is over. 
1-sterio and cd's stolen.
2-crash.
3-sterio and cd's stolen. again.

but i have a feeling i wont be having a car for a very long time. 
and if i do, i have to pay for it. 
therefore im starting to work with my mom after school everyday. 
$9 an hour baby. 
so in time ill have more money in teh bank and maybe ill be getting places on my own. 

and thats my story of me. and crashing. 
i hope you enjoyed.


but everything else in life seems to be as good as can be. 
the whole car situation just brings me down. 


oh yes. 
and sphincter boy is president of the US again...
i was really hoping he didnt win. 
but what can you do. 
no young people, who will most likely be democrat, didnt vote.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, WHY NOT USE IT PEOPLE. COME ONNNNNNNN!

i need to move now.
i think im going to australia.
with a certain patrick. :)
and some kangaroos. <3

college apps....BAH!.
sisters coming home this weekend. 
shes going to help me and we are going to see SAW. 
so im excited about that. 
and not gonna lie - i laugh whenever someone says 'go see saw'
cause of see saw. like the little playground thing. yea. im done.

so thats that. 
have a good week kids.
stay safe. 
especially on left turns. 

night<3"

my lungs just exploded and it hurt like no other.
i took a sip of water and a breath at the same time i guess? 
and kaboom! and ouch.

...that was a good explination...

brooklyn was so awesome. 
saturday night was a little creepy with your average 'carlos' knocking on my sisters apartment door at 3:30 in the morning claiming to be looking for ""uhhh...sabrina?"" sorry asshole...wrong apartment.
and then later pulling on the doorknob. 
thank God for those several massive locks they put on the doors.
::sigh:: brooklyn :)...

sunday i went to the city for some lunch and an attempt to look at parsons which didnt go over to well with mr. angry security guard. and then coney island which i have never been to yet until now. i took some awesome pictures which i developed today. so i cant wait to make prints :D
then that night we went to Avalon. this club thats in an old church. 
my sisters best friend, vito, is the DJ so thats how i got in. 
i dont think ive ever had more fun in my life. :D
i shook my ass all night long until 4 in the morning. 
it was soooo amazingly fun. 

so yes. happy 25th birthday corinne. <3

for once i have no desire to go to bed any time soon.
im not sure why. 
thats mainly why im updating. 

me and jill went out to get more things for our holloween costumes today.
we're nothing really.
we just wanna be glittery and fun. 
and im really excited for it.
horrayy!

im almost in debt. 
i think i need to get another job because 28 bucks a week isnt doing it for me.

i feel bad, but i cant say im not happy.
im glad shes one of the officers tho cause she has a lot of great ideas for the club. 
i think its gonna be a good year for photo club so im excited to work with her, laura, and pasco. :)

i went to go see every time i die yesterday at the downtown with everyone.
what a greatttttt showwwwwww.
oh my goodness.
the first band was ehhh. and i wasnt too fond of zao.
but i enjoyed misery signals and etid was just wonderful. 
i havent enjoyed myself/sweat so much at a show since norma jean.
so it was a good time.

ive been trying to rent eternal sunshine of the spotless mind all weekend long, but no luck with that.
i wanna see it so badly. 
so on friday we ended up getting session 9 which is a favorite of mine and i wanted pat pat and laura to watch it. and after the show yesterday since i was disgusting from the show, me and pat just stayed in and got the virgin suicides, cause i wanted to see that too. it was interesting.

today was st. james day. 
it was a nice day out so me and pat went.
but it wasnt all that interesting so we went to the beach.
it was nicee :)

i find im writing in this thing alot more than i like to. 
i dont kno why.

another field trip tomorrow. 
last one until spring. 

this weekend coming up, me and my family are going into brooklyn for my sister, corinnes birthday.
then if the mother permits, me and my sister allison are going to stay over corinnes apartment saturday night, then sunday night corinnes gonna take us to a club in the city and attempt to get me in somehow cause she knows everyone in the world. so hopefully my mom will let me do this. 
it seems like fun and i love my sisters friends soooo yea. 
thatd be an awesome time. :)

about a time in my life that has had the biggest effect on me. 
which was my first trip to VA beach with my youth group. 
and its making me sad thinking about it.

but now i have writers block and dont know exactly what to write so im just updating.

i went canoeing today. 
god it sucked. 
i really only enjoyed the last hour of it when we got the giggles and laughed at everything ever. like duckhuggies....yea...

me, kristen wallner, and mallory must have hit about every salt marsh out there.
our canoe like veered to the left for some reason. 
and not gonna lie...i was a miserable steerer.

but whatever. it wasnt school so thats good.
and oh gee golly. we get to go on another field trip next monday...

photo club is tomorrow. 
with elections and all. 
and im going to try to run for the president of the club which i could really use for my applications to schools and such. so hopefully that works out.
and good luck to everyone else whose running too.

everytime i die is on saturday. 
and im rather excited.
a good show could make my hatred for school so much less...agressive??
hmmmmmm.

this is gonna be long.

+today was the last day of vbs. 
sorry to say it was not as good as past years. 
i dont think any year will beat the year we did 'gods werkus circus.'

no one knows what im talking about.

but i still had fun. and i cant express the awesome feeling i get when i see a thousand little kids singing about how God loves them. it makes me happy and makes me feel like they have hope now. and for some reason wont be corrupted by the hideous world out there.

yes im a church nerd.
bite me. :D

+this one family that works in the church is hosting this little girl from harlem. like real harlem, NYC. and she was so happy to be at vbs. she even went up and prayed in front of everyone by herself. and she was only about 10. that also made me really happy. im glad she can see that there are much better things in the world then what she might be growing up in.

+next weekend im pretty sure i get to go to stay with my sister in brooklyn. 
oh god i cannot wait. i miss her so much its unbelieveable. and i seriously cant wait to get the hell out of this town and away from all the stupid people in it.(<--excepting the few kids ive been hanging out with almost everyday. i love them. :D ) not gonna lie. i hate about three quarters of the class of 2005. but yes. a weekend away in the city with fun people is just what i need to clear my head and revive myself.

+ive also been very mean and aggressive lately...? i dont kno why. and i feel really bad about it. like i punched jill in the face yesterday. not on purpose of course, we were wrestling...but i never really thought id end up punching someone like that. sorry jilly<3<3<3<3. and ive also been really mean to eulau. and i dont mean to be. just mean comments come into my head and pour out my mouth and i really dont mean them. hes a great kid and i hope he knows i dont really mean to be a bitch to him. 

im writing alot. but its all just coming out so bare with me if your even still reading any of this.

+i need to stop being such a woose. honestly. i need to get balls and just not be so scared of nothing! otherwise if i wait any longer im probably gonna lose someone that is starting to really mean alot to me. and it doesnt help that their just as shy as i am. but i really hope everything goes well. cause i think i might be starting to fall for them. ooooooh lust. crazy crazy. raar raar. :)

+OH! and you know what really! pissed me off. 
when you fucking liked someone. and yea ok i knew nothing was ever gonna happen which is why i never acted on it. and then a couple months later you find out they knew. but they STILl went along and flirted and did what they did. well FUCK YOU. if you knew whyd you have to go and give me big hugs every time you saw me and all the little things along those lines. you know im sensetive and that youre a flirt and that shit like that could ruin me. whatever. you dont talk to me anymore anyway and i really couldnt care less. go drink your life away with every other shit faced kid in smithtown.

i friggin hate writing in here.
and i hate that i do it. 
whatev. no one reads it anyway.

night. <3

<b>edit:</b> oh yes. and the parents have really been pissing me off lately. its one of those cases where my mom is trying to relive her younger years through me. she doesnt know what i know about certain people and she needs to let me make my own mistakes, if they even are mistakes. shes too closed minded for me to handle. >:O"

<b>3</b> this girl. oh man. ive known her MY WHOLE LIFE! and i dont think... i dont even know. lets just say my new favorite moment of her is killing negro spider in my basement with her yesterday. <3
<b>4</b> i think i saw this kid in the photo lab almost as much as i was in there. even if he wasnt doing any work.
<b>5</b> umm this girl...this girll... she doesnt like many people. but i hope i am one of the ones she does like. even though we dont talk that much and just happen to see each other all the time at starbucks or the beach at night? shes a good kid :)
<b>6</b> my mother fucking asian brother. you may not know it, but hes too awesome for words. 
<b>7</b> me and this girl lost touch this past year and i miss her alot sometimes. i guess its partially my own fault? i dont really know what happened. but i do kno that 9th and 10th grade were so great for me because she was involved 95% of the time. 
<b>8</b> umm i spent a couple months hanging out with this girl alot with gang seshes and all. but that stopped. shes crazy for the starting line and has an awesome personality. 
<b>9</b> pshh my best friend who i could not live without. !!!!!! shes cah-razy!
<b>10</b> i dont kno this kid really. but he was standing in front of me at the early november show.he seemed like a good kid haha :)
<b>11</b> this boy. he doesnt use his LJ anymore but hes still friended. hes a beast. a good one. we were really close for a while but that kind of faded. and he makes me laugh constantly. and he made my jr. prom a very very good one. 
<b>12</b> wow. ive known this kid since preschool! well there was quite a gap in between preschool and 8th grade but thats ok. i love him. but not that turkey noise he makes during ratscrew. 
<b>13</b> this girl made 10th grade french a blast. i wish i got to hang out with her more often. 
<b>14</b> this kid made 11th grade french a blast haha. oh man 95% of the time i was laughing at things him and ilana would say. hes too awesome. and we peed in back of starbucks together >_< haha. 
<b>15</b> i also met this boy in photo club along with #2. hes tall. had a fro. and is about one of the sweetest kids ive yet to meet.
<b>16</b> i dont like you one bit.
<b>17</b> i had writing lab with this girl and shes the nicest person EVER! ive yet to sign her yearbook :( and wish i got to see her more often. shes such a good person and i know shell do wonderful in college and everything she does. 
<b>18</b> umm this little man has lived in back of me his whole life and he does AMAZING impressions and i love him. 
<b>19</b> my asian brothers brother! 
<b>20</b> i not too fond of you. you try to be so original and you end up exactly like the rest of them. you cant be everyones best friend cause you end up hurting the best of them all. 

mwahaha. guess who you are. 
its probably not even that hard damnit. <3"

it was an awesome day. and we saw the best fireworks with USA's and smiley faces and everything. 

monday was a waste. 
tuesday i hung out with walsh-face and there was alot of political debating going on in his house. i was a little intimidated so i kept my mouth shut. haha im not very big on politics anyway. couldnt really care less. is that wrong?
it was fun tho and momma walsh makes a mean dinner.
after we went to jills with pat1 (moore) and pat0 (pasco), dan steve and thats all i think. it was fun. some poker, kill marry do. you kno how we do. 

i got two free hairdryers in the mail this week. 
they were a complimentary gift from conair because a while ago while i was blow drying my hair, umm sparks flew out and these parts went flying but luckily got caught within the hairdryer and didnt fly into my face. it was a little scary.
but i have an even better hairdryer now so its all good. 

speaking of. i need to get a hair cut. 
i want it short but not the same as what ive been getting. and not the same as everyone else. 
i dont kno. im open for suggestions. 
i also wanna dye it or do something. 
i hate it always being the samee ::shakes fists::

blah blah. im so sick of this town. 
i really wanna go in the city and stay with my sister for a few days. 
just to get away for a bit.

you end up in starbucks parking lot at least once every night. and i feel soo...i dont kno. the fact that everyone hangs out there everynight annoys me and yet there i am doing it. so i really shouldnt be talking. 

today i went to L-rods grad party and then matts college grad party. 
that was nice. 
then tonight i went to see dodgeball with jill pat and brendan. it was such a funny movie. and we had a good time. 
then yes...afterwards ended up aimlessly driving. 
pat always drives me. 
i need to start paying him gas money cause i feel bad.

i never see ashley anymore :-/ 
i miss her. and we need to hang out more often cause this is dumb that we're best friends and never see each other.

and im going to fail both. blahhhh

but summers been good so far. 


today to cheer me up cause i was feeling like poop, i went to pats and we went out for ice cream. but ended up having a meal at the brookhouse. 
and since they didnt have cakebatter flavored ice cream we went to carvel instead. 
then watched donnie darko. 
i still dont understand it. 
i get the main idea but its the little things that are bugging me. 
like how exactly did donnie travel back in time? he didnt have any big metal object. 
and if frank went back in time, how come he ended up dying anyway. 
and even tho he went back and died, how in any way would that prevent his mom and sister from dying in the plane crash? its still gonna happen right? 

i think. 

i dont know. im really confused haha.
someone please explain it to me.



this summers gonna be good. 
im gonna try and stop having these stupid little fits i keep having. 
i just need to move on thats all. 
and honestly im starting to not even like the person as a person anymore. 
or that might be just me trying to get over them. 
shame shame.

i wanna meet new people and make new friends. 
not lose the ones i have now tho. 
just make new ones. 
so i hope i can do that. 

dress rehearsal on wed.

then ended up going to starbucks to meet kevin, justine, eulau, arthus and all these kids. 
it was nice cause i have not seen kevin in forever and i love him dearly. 
so we sat drinking and talking. 
matthew showed up randomly.
and we all decided to go to pats for poker.

i learned how to play pretty quick.
and my beginners luck came and i won two rounds and then lost miserably. 
i hate you beginners luck. :(

more kids showed up. 
matt left. 
and we all decided to go to shep jones. 
we all got pumped and scared each other with stories.
now i was flipping out while going through but shep jones was kind of cheap.
i was expecting more. like a old run down house or something. 
we should have gone down one of the side roads. 

laura ended up sleeping over. we watched most of the movie Monster. 
it was really good. and really sad actually.
it was a very fun night. :)


i was getting really fustrated at one point tho.
im so sick of myself and these stupid feelings.
they were almost gone this week until last night. AHHHHHHHH!
bleh. i cant talk about this. 


6 more days of school. 
and if i pass all my tests...
im gonna be a senior. thats the weirdest thought.
we're all in 9th grade to me. not soon to be seniors. 
and im gonna cry alot the last day of school i think. :-/ 
im such a baby.

i finally got the pictures from the early november show and the pictures from the show with jesse lacey developed. and they're wonderful. im excited. :)

i went with matt. 
and it was really a good time. i had alot of fun dancing and eating and everything. :)

except i broke my toe...by stubbing it on someones shoe?? what the hell? :(
and when i woke up this morning it was purple out of its mind. 
its really gross. 

after prom me, matt, and everyone else in the world went to macevoys house in south hampton. 
oh goodness it was glorious! 
our reaction when we pull up to the driveway:
<b>matt</b>: wait...is that his house?
<b>annie</b>: ...oh my god!
<b>me</b>: !holy shit.
<b>scott just waking up</b>: I HAVE A BONER!

the kings game was hillarious. 
i had no place to sleep. and couldnt anyway so i just kind of wandered around in the morning eating popcorn in random spots. only a few of us were still awake. 
then after scott woke everyone up, i wound up sleeping for about 4 more hours with matt and justine was in the closet?? haha. 

then we cleaned up and left. :( 
it was the best and only prom ive ever been too haha. <3<3


i came home and made quick plans to go to the moneen show with christoph. 
jillian couldnt go cause of her weak ass imune system :(
but i bought her a shirt. cause she was really looking forward to this whole weekend and it got ruined for her. i love you jill. <3
i felt like it was gonna be one of those boring shows where ill only end up enjoying the band i went to see. 
but it was fine.
moneen was fun and exciting and i love them. 
we met up with steve and pat so that was awesome. :)

last dance competition this weekend. 
and for the seniors it was their last one ever. 
:(

umm we somehow ended up winning top best intermediate dance studio...???
i dont kno how but we did. 
i think its cause the little kids did really good. so props to them. :)
it was funny. no one expected to get it so we all went back to the audience and got ready to leave and as my dance teacher is like out the door they call her name. it was so random.

but it was a pretty good weekend. 
a little too much drama. 
but i love those girls and im so sad that the seniors are leaving. :(


anyway.
last night was jills birthday party. 
shes 16 and i love her. 
of course people had to be a little shady but whatever. 
you should always expect that when having a party. 
but it was pretty fun. i enjoyed myself :)

i made her a saves the day 'through being cool' shirt.
cause thats her favorite album. and they dont make shirts for it. 
or none that we could find. 
then i got her a disk holder to hold her masive amounts of cds. 
made her a mix. 
and got her a bracelet. i hope she likes it.

this is such a good song. <3<3

ive been a little <i>ehh</i> lately.
a bunch of reasons why.
but thats nothing to discuss here.

"event","wow. 

last night i went to the hot rod circuit show at the downtown. 
the special guest = jesse lacey. :D

im so happy i went. 

i went with Jon and Jill. 
i really liked Lux Courageous.
and kevin devine was good. except the whole crowd was talking during his set. 
i wanted to punch every single person there. they put me in such a bad mood. 
hot rod circuit was ok. 
and then jesse came on and holy crap. 
i dont even kno. 
ive always wanted to see him and/or brand new live. 
and i finally did. 
and he was sooo good. and i took about 478295738274382 pictures. that need to be developed now!

im such a teeny bopper for him. 
and i dont care :)

before he played me jon jill and kristin went to the VIP area so jon could talk to him. and he told us to stay after and hed find us. 
so we did and hugged me and jill. signed my bag, her shirt. and took a picture.

awesome. <3<3<3

and we also met the guitarist from glassjaw. 
and jill shit her pants cuase she praises them. 
she was such a little girl it was so cute. :)

it was so wonderful. 
and then we got lost on the way home. 
but it was fun haha. 

thank you jon for you wonderful connections and going to church when you were little. :)"

"event","competition all weekend long. 
too bad it sucked. 
i hope we never go back to USTD again. 

fri - ashley and scott came to watch me. then bryan came too. and we went to applebees afterwards. 

sat - jill came to watch. and then laura came and we went downstairs for scotts surprise party. it was pretty fun. his friends are all really nice and fun. 
we ice skated and did laser tron for free. GOD i miss laser tron. it was sooo awesome and i definately wanna do it everyday of my life. 

today after i danced i went to the downtown with my mom cause we thought you could pick up the tickets for tuesday but you cant. the e-mail lied to me. 
but i bought tickets to moneen and northstar anyway so it wasnt a total waste. 
and the guy working there told me that brand new's not playing tuesday night. 
but i couldnt tell if he was just kidding or not. i dunno. but he said he thinks whoever is playing is better. so hopefully i like them. plus kevin devine is playing and hes really good so yay. 

people need to not be sketchy towards me just because im friends with people they hate. i have no part in it whatsoever so just leave me alone. 

im sooo tired. 
nap time. 
have a good week of school kids. <3"

that was really nice. 
i hate math and i hate the sub.

my favorite part was dancing with jill and steve to ghetto music in the darkroom. 
they are so fun. and i was sweating. and it was great. :D

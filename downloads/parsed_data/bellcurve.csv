</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">Freshman year I lived in a <a href=""http://bellcurve.livejournal.com/29026.html#cutid1""><u>dorm room</u></a>. Sophomore year, I had my own <a href=""http://bellcurve.livejournal.com/36865.html""><u>little apartment</u></a>. Now, and for the rest of my undergrad college years, I&#39;ll be residing in a townhouse with <strong>four </strong>other<strong> </strong>girls. Luckily, I got my own room, and for the summer, I don&#39;t have to share my bathroom. So here&#39;s a little tour of my space, let me just say that I&nbsp;adore my room, a little more so than the one I got back at home.</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><lj-cut text=""it's all pretty much from Ikea and U.O.""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bellcurve/pic/000xbe7t"" />
When you enter, this is what you&#39;d see to your right. I love my quilted comforter and little circle rug, and new poster, &quot;Keep calm and carry on.&quot;

A zoom onto the bookcase. Eww to the bottom shelf. Most of the textbooks I&#39;ve accumulated, I decided not to sell them back like most students, because I&#39;m a pack rat, and who knows when I&#39;ll need them again.

<img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bellcurve/pic/000xda16"" />
Atop my bookcase is a framed picture of Boy&#39;s and mine adopted panda. His name&#39;s Billy. We took him from the San Diego Zoo.

A surprisingly dramatic shot of my bed. It&#39;s a Serta, meaning it&#39;s so damn comfortable and therefore so hard to get out of bed for my 8 &#39;o&#39; clock summer classes. For those not familiar with my Irvine stuffed cohabitants, the gang consists of Ollie (the bear with suspenders), Polliana (the Russian doll), and Melville (the monster.) And yes, I&nbsp;am 4 years old.

And to the left is where I&nbsp;study. My desk. It&#39;s so cool, haa. On the right there&#39;s a whiteboard, and my chair is so cute. It spins and leans back. I decided that I didn&#39;t want a manly leather chair, or a cheapy looking Office Max-esque chair. If you can&#39;t tell by now, I was very particular in decorating my room.

<img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bellcurve/pic/000xgpx8"" />
By the door is my TV. No cable :( The roomies and I have decided it&#39;s too expensive, and there&#39;s nothing really on in the summer, but come fall we will re-evaluate and hopefully we&#39;ll all agree to cable. In the stand I put my mags and in the drawer is my small collection of DVDs.

<img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bellcurve/pic/000xpq9b"" />
I have the &quot;master bedroom&quot; which included a bathroom. Here&#39;s the sink/mirror, a little messy, I say.

<img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bellcurve/pic/000xh4re"" />
To the right is my walk-in closet. I finally organized and unpacked everything. Es nice.

<img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bellcurve/pic/000xk0xa"" />
And to the left is the shower/toilet. Same fun shower curtain as before. Hee.
And that&#39;s all, folks.

Twas the living room, I have no television set, yet. Polaroids and doodles on the wall.

<img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bellcurve/pic/000rsh91"" />

Framed pictures of me and the Boy, San Francisco, and this year&#39;s trip to Canadia.

The rarely clean kitchen.

<img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bellcurve/pic/000rw7cp"" />

Plates and sort for two. And if you can&#39;t tell by now, I totally snagged a lot of things from the lovely Ikea.

The bedroom. It may not look like it, but my bed is a full, my pals who are in the same complex as I have twin size beds.

<img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bellcurve/pic/000rzqsh"" />

Pollyanna and Melville are stuck with me for another school year.

I love my kick ass headphones from Urban.

My shower curtain is all kinds of happy.</div></div>"

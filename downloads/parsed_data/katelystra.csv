"event","Well hello.
I always hate updating my livejournal after being away for so long. I LOVE to tell all my stories and relive each waking moment...I love memories more than life...wait...ha ha memories are life. Anyway, I will attempt to do some updating, and possibly even keep this thing up-to-date as the year rolls on. I am mostly doing this because Krystal wants me to...
One month exactly. That's nuts.
Let's see.
One month ago, I went on my first ever (ever is the correct term...very first) coffee date with a boy ha ha. Like...the first time I ever did anything just me and a boy...how hilarious is that?! I love it. And pretty much from that day he fell hard-core to the Katie Charm and finally got around to asking me out last week...October 25th...sometime around 1:00am ha ha. So there you go...first boyfriend for this girl. Apparently it's this huge shocker...to me mostly! I seriously had NO anticipation of dating this year...the funny thing about life is that you have no idea what to expect. I have always been totally cool with not having a boyfriend, I QUITE enjoyed my single life. But as much as I enjoyed it, I think this year I was finally like...alright, I'm content. The summer was soooo good for that, just a lot of focusing and stuff...and then, when I was finally like...I'm good, God's humour kicks in and I got bitten by some sort of&nbsp; ""this boy is cute and fun and loves God and I want to spend lots of time with him"" bug. Oh life.
Other than that, school is pretty nuts. I don't have any midterms, but lots and lots of projects. For instance, I just handed in a lesson plan portfolio thing that was 27 pages long. And that was only 8 lesson plans. I have a few more of those to do as the weeks go on, a bunch of book reports, presentations, teaching class things, and then a big 20 lesson plan thing for art due at the end...plus lots of weekly homework. So, that is always good times.
I LOVE my roommates...way more than I ever imagined. The 4 of us get along SOO SOO well, it's sweet. At the beginning of the year, we had to make an apartment covenant...we dodged that bullet by summing everything we wanted to say into ""Let's Be Friends""...and that is seriously our covenant. And it works...we are great friends! ha ha Impact group is amazing as well...all the impact groups are focused on prayer/accountability/holy living this year, and it has been amazing. Jenny is an awesome leader for us, and we just have some incredible, encouraging and challenging discussions and times in prayer. Sometimes we go over the set time by a half hour or an hour and no one cares, it is just so cool.
Still working the old Basics. Not too many old men lately which is nice. But there are always the Timmy's creepers that we randomly meet when millions of us go over from school.
Volleyball is sweet. We lost pretty hardcore last tourney...well, we actually took a game from Redeemer, and almost beat Emmanuel, definitely lost good to Tyndale. But we have a great team (we got Baxter to come back :) ha ha) and things are always fun there...somehow I ended up co-captain again...that's just weird. I don't really like the title actually. I like having the responsibilities, but I could go without the title...I just like being on the team.
Thanksgiving was awesome - hanging out at Grandma's with Jay, Jackie, Loran, and my family. Tossing the football...trying to keep it away from Indy. Eating up food hardcore. Oh, and speaking of hardcore food eating...Just did a pie eating contest with Natalie. Well, that was our team. We got schooled in eating - though I held my own I will say!! Oh team Flusselman...or Coal Shaft...we totally dressed like people from Signs...we are such losers and I love it. So yeah, that was two days ago...and after that I was SOOO hungry...I had two burgers, two pops and chocolate for supper...you know, because I only had a whole PIE for lunch...and then yesterday I had NO appetite at all and definitely felt nauseous enough from the food I did it to throw it right back up...sweet eh.
Kyle...that would be the cute boy who's hand I hold sometimes ha ha...is coming to my parents' house on church on Sunday for some lunch and probably some UnoSpin, that is fun. He has already met my parents and brothers, and Loran...I think Grandma, Jay and Jackie will be there too...ha ha, that sucker doesn't know what he's in for! ha ha jokes jokes. Then on Remembrance Day weekend, I am heading to Chatham with him to meet his family. I have already met his younger sister (she starting going to Heritage this year as well), and have been ""myspacing"" his older sister...and I guess his mom loves me from Kyle and Katie (his younger sister, weird I know) talking me up. So pretty much I'm not nervous. And our families seem similar, so that's cool.
But yeah, that is my month update in a nutshell.
I have been experiencing what I think might be a slight mental breakdown lately ha ha.
Just really not thinking straight! Today I was sitting at my computer talking to Krystal. I had one of my huge (1.5 L) water bottles and it was like half full. I picked it up, and was going to tilt it back and forth - you know, water sloshing, it's a fun noise. Well....I didn't realize at all that the cap wasn't on, so I tilted it down and didn't realize until a couple seconds later, when I heard the noise of the waterfall hitting my carpet and had it finally register, that I was pouring water ALL over my floor ha ha ha. You know how sometimes you begin to realize you are doing something, but it takes your hand a few seconds to catch up with your brain and stop being lazy? yeah, I've lost it.
And it wouldn't even be that bad, except for...yesterday, I was on the way out the door to class...I went to grab my water from the fridge, and in doing so, I knocked the milk onto the kitchen floor. It took awhile to register. I put my water on the counter, dropped my bag, and then was like...""Crap, the milk is going to keep pouring out until I pick it up."" So yeah, I had a big mess to clean up and that resulted in being just a few minutes late for class. What a spaz.
Anyway, now I am off. To do homework. Lucky for me, my homework day landed on the same day as my mental breakdown day...hmmm...we'll see how that one goes...
Peace out."

"event","<p>So, it's been about a month.&nbsp;<br />Who knew I could go this long without talking to myself on the internet...(we all know that that is the truth behind blogging)<br />To say life has been crazy would be a rather large understatement.<br />To say that life has been amazing would also be an understatement of great proportions.<br />School is well underway, new friendships forming, stories of old being rehashed...it's beautiful.<br />The school part is pretty hectic actually. I only have four classes, but they are all Christian School Education classes now - no more general stuff, so it can be pretty intense at times...getting into writing objectives, lesson plans, etc. Got to teach (with a partner) a gym class for a homeschoolers group yesterday. That was sweet. SO easy ha ha. We had the grade 7, 8, and 10 group...loved it! Definitely more nervous for my little kids groups than this one...went really well. I am also in an art class...wow, that is a humbling experience!!<br /><br />Enough of the depressing talk. Just kidding really - the more practical stuff I do, I do realize that this is what I am meant to do, it is just a hard process. And a rather frightening process to be quite honest. I mean, soon enough I will be going out and doing EA placements and teaching and stuff...woah...hold onto your grown-up horse, I don't feel old enough to do this yet! Maybe it's just my baby face...<br /><br />But yeah, so many new friendships. It is truly incredible the people God continually brings into our lives. I mean, you think that there can't be any way that you will meet people of the same caliber of those you have already met and boom...a new batch of amazing people to add to your acquaintances list. My roommates are amazing - Krystal, Kaitlyn and Carolyn - love them greatly, we have the best apartment ever :) All of girls' dorm is wonderful. There are honestly SO many girls of amazing integrity and love and generosity...it blows my mind. I am truly blessed to be here and to learn from everyone. And my volleyball girls...you are like no others...gotta love volleyball :)<br /><br />Had a fun little injury awhile ago. Playing intramural volleyball, took a really, really, really quite hard spike and my hand exploded! Hello Puff Daddy, welcome to Heritage. Had a spontaneous tumour growing out of my hand...it looked like I stole the volleyball, stuffed it in my hand, and tried to run away...ha ha...did the emerge thing from 12:30am-6:00am, that was a great time. Chasity and Krystal...your patience and love astounds me! Got home, an hour of sleep and then class and from there things stayed crazy. Somehow 3:30 or 4am is a regular bedtime...don't know how that happened. But I am surprisingly not too tired...weird. I did crash a bit the other night...the constant laughing...the inability to remember what oatmeal was called...it was good times.<br /><br />Learning so much. Well, trying to anyway. The themes in Impact Group this year are on: prayer, accountability and holy living. And surprisingly (ha ha or not), I have been really trying to stretch myself and grow in my prayer life lately, so that is really cool. Really trying to learn to listen, to actively seek out opportunities, to pray, and then the constant struggle of communication and compassion. I am such a disastrous work in progress. God's forgiveness and grace just amazes me. Oh, and the sky of course...ha ha...<br /><br />Went on a bag lunch run to Toronto a week ago today. Oh my goodness. Such an incredible experience. I don't have the time to tell all my tales, but it was so incredible. Ask me about it sometime when you see me, I love to talk about it - God is SO amazing. So many opportunities to pray with people and just seeing how everything fits together, how God works in all situations, and it was really just a huge strengthening for myself and my faith seeing God work and just as He revealed Himself to me constantly...so incredible.</p>
<p>Anyway, working tonight and tomorrow morning. I only work Fridays and Saturdays, so that is nice. I didn't give Sundays as an option during the school year. It just makes life too hectic with wanting to go to church and 3:16, doing homework in the afternoon, etc. I really just appreciate the opportunity of church so much. </p>
<p>Anyway, doing&nbsp;a lot of rambling. Pepperdine, here is my blog finally...sorry for keeping you waiting, I hope it was worth the wait :)</p>"

"event","Wow. Training Week has been a blast. Tres fun.
Hanging out with Chasity and Krystal (ROOMY yeaaaaah) a lot plus of course Jenny, Chantal, Laurie, Megan...whoever wants to join really. Talking some French :), remembering when, and just being psycho maniacs. Seriously, I laugh A LOT, but this week I have been laughing practically non-stop. Three nights in a row, me and my girls have just been playing cards, mowing down some scrumptious treats and laughing it up...pretty much my favourite!!
Yeah, very excited for the year. Very excited to meet my roommates, all the freshman, and the two people who will soon join STUCA. The Leadership Team is meshing incredibly well I think, staff too, which is stellar. We just have a good time, but we also get a lot done which is great of course. Very happy with our progress and teamwork, and the whole Leadership team is so encouraging and positive so far...tres wonderful. Oh, and Exec (Me, Krystal and Jon what what) we have a blast...can't wait to have the Business Manager join our Exec fun.&nbsp;
Led a devo on Tuesday on the book of Esther - focusing on Mordecai and his constant integrity throughout the book, no matter his situation, circumstance, or the relationships. Definitely one of my big prayers for the year. I love that book and his example. Such an encouragement to me because God will use anyone willing and besides that, God is just tres amazing. But it is also very challenging, because there is that step I need to take personally of being like - okay, here's everything...but yeah, definitely been really challenged and encouraged lately.
Missing that Kristine girl a lot. Got to talk to her two times on the phone this week though :) that made me tres excited. But I hate having to tell her how much fun we are having because I just feel bad and wish so much that she was here! But she isn't, she has something else for her right now...just hoping she can visit in the next couple of months!
ha ha ha okay, we did a personality test thing today. And let me just say, that for whatever reason, every time I do one of these things (or something like it), there is one that PEGS me to a T!! So I don't know if I am a ""stereotype"" or what is up with that, but yeah...I obviously have traits from the other descriptions, but this one is definitely me. I am going to include it because it is just hilarious how on it is...
GOLD:
I am conventional. I am the pillar of strength and have high respect for authority. I like to establish and maintain policies, procedures, and schedules. I have a strong sense of right and wrong. I am naturally parental and dutiful.
I do things that require organization, dependability, management, and detail. I need to be useful and to belong. I am the sensible, stable backbone of any group. I believe that work comes before play.
I value home, family, status, security, and tradition. I seek relationships that help me ensure a predictable life. I am caring, concerned, and loyal. I show concern through the practical things I do.

Needs: to belong, to be responsible, dutiful
Values: bonding relationships, stability, security, conforming to rules, organized
Abilities: supervisor, protector, rule maker and enforcer, sequential thinker, stabilizer, provider
Behaviours: economical, authority centred, structured, dependable, responsible, fatalistic, detail-oriented

How to Relate with Golds
Do: carry through with what you say you're going to do, be on time, acknowledge them when they do something well, give them time to plan things

Don't: expect them to be spontaneous, force them to take risks, demand too much immediate change, expect them to challenge established rules

Anyway, I thought it was funny. We were in a big group when Cheryl was reading all the descriptions&nbsp;to us. She started with Gold and in the first few seconds, Krystal and Megan (who were on either side of me) and Chasity were all like pointing and laughing at me ha ha because it was me so much!! And then everyone else did too ha ha.
More planning, meetings, and grunt work to come. A super fun week, but the long days and socializing (aka, last two nights of 5 hours sleep each...) makes a Golden Girl like me tired :)"

"event","You know, life sure is crazy.
At the beginning of summer, I was sitting in my newly furnished bunk bed room of 122, wondering about the fall and desperately wishing it to come quickly, as well as dreading the long summer ahead. And now, here I sit...momentarily at my parents' house before I move to the small window room of 122, which will be furnished by sweet 44 year old furniture (the greatest kind), so completely thankful for my summer and wondering how it ever passed by so quickly. I am also amazed, again and continually, at my Saviour, who is constantly renewing my trust in Him, even through crazy things like watching the sky change. What a marvel this world is. Oh, and I am also extremely grateful for my grandma, what a sweet, wonderful woman.
The summer of surprises. Appropriately named from the start, but the surprises never ceased. The biggest surprise of all, I think, is that I will actually miss this summer. The more it progressed, the more I realized how incredible it was. It was the perfect summer, given to me by the perfect God, and my schedule was constantly being arranged in such a perfect notion that I could do everything I needed, make a little money, visit some friends, relax a bit, but mostly...take TIME. Time to have fun, time to think, time to ponder, (I consider thinking and pondering two separate entities) time to pray, and time to learn. It came to my attention as I watched my summer draw to an end that everything I started to learn last summer (taking time for God FIRST, pray as one of the most important factors, etc.) could be perfectly executed given my schedule. Granted, I didn't take advantage of this very often, but the chance was mine, and I sure did learn a lot in my summer of surprises.
Besides that, greatly looking forward to the year!!
Training Week in...T-minus 36 hours...that is almost the precise time I will be moving back into dorm :), shortly afterwards I will be re-united with many people near and dear to my heart :)
Girls' dorm attendance is down this year, but still very excited...only have three roommates (besides myself of course) - Krystal (!!), Carolyn and Kaitlyn (Kate...and one of my cousin's bridesmaids...WEIRD), but yeah...3 K's and&nbsp;a C...very WEIRD...thinking of slogan's now :) Carolyn joins the kkk, come see what the kkk's up to...you get the picture...
OH, and I watched three movies with my family tonight...When a Stranger Calls, Chicken Little (which I had seen of course) and Hoodwinked. All quality. Luckily, we watched the scary one first and not at 11!! Man, it was good.
Ahhh yes, a little pillow time approaching now...
Family picnic tomorrow with my whole dad's side...he was one of 11 kids...you get the picture...CHAOS and lots of loud, Dutch people!! ha ha
Cheers."

"event","Alright, so, here I sit...just finished putting the five lovely children to bed...but it is a slight relief because I can feel myself wearing down and don't wish to be short with them! Tomorrow I will need patience straight from God...I wake up at 7:00 to work 8:00-1:00pm and then babysit from 2:00ish until...well, probably 11:00 or so. Brad and Shelby are at the wedding rehearsal tonight and then wedding and reception tomorrow. Plus, they are good friends of Brad and Shelby and Brad is the pastor and MC...so yeah, it will be late.
HEY, wonderful, fabulous news! I got a letter today from the school, and I got a 600 dollar scholarship (split between semesters) and a 260 dollar bursary!! THANK YOU GOD :) Man, is He the greatest or what? I was definitely not counting on the bursary and I got the full scholarship amount, so that is amazing!! I might actually break even for first semester! Second semester is another story, but that's a ways off...
I am almost finished packing my stuff up. Every time I have to move/pack, I always anticipate that there will be less than there is...a bad idea! But, I am mostly finished...gotta pack up my computer before I go to bed, plus some miscellaneous kitchen stuff...and then there will be a few things to do in the morning BEFORE work at 8:00........yikes! And then I get to do it all again in reverse in 9 days!! So crazy...oh, and I have to clean the apartment quickly again tonight before bed...it's going to be another late one I think!
Last night I was up until about 3:00...I was doing well with the packing and cleaning after I worked until 9:00...and then I got talking to some new students...I had talked to two guys and was just about to do more packing...and then I got talking to this other guy...and let's just say that he is talkative and I am too...plus we are both really excited for school ha ha and yeah...somehow we talked for like 3 hours...woah. So yeah, had to finish packing after that...and by that time it was somewheres around 1:30...
Not much else is new. Living at my parents' next week. I have five more shifts of work until I get a three week break as school is starting and it's going to be crazy! I am actually at that point where I know that deep down I am excited for school to start, but I have been waiting for the start of school for so long that I feel like I have used up all my excitement! ha ha I know that once Training Week starts and everyone is moving in, I will get excited again. I will get to see people!! and will be reminded that there isn't as much going on as maybe I had thought, that I have a team working with me, and just the constant reassurance I have had that God is going to something amazing this year!
Actually, that is what one of the new guys, Joseph, and I were talking about last night...how this summer we have both felt so relax, and both having this crazy feeling that we are waiting for something, anticipating something...just feeling at peace&nbsp; you know. And it's crazy...talking about that last night and for me about finances and how I still just feel great about the year...and then today I get 860 bucks!! How great is God?!
Alright...people are moving upstairs...
Later days..."

"event","Yes indeed, it sure is the summer of surprises...

Please pray for STUCA. We have lost one more ha ha...oh man. Petra has decided to resign. I completely support her and trust in her judgment. I know she prayed about it for a long time and wasn't careless with the decision. It just means things will be different than planned...but is that not the theme of the summer?
I have been praying for the leadership and stuca and the year so much and just feel like that momma's boy Satan is trying to wear me down. But you know, God is good...in fact, He is great!!
So yeah, things like the budget will fall to me and Jon (and since Jon doesn't know what he is doing yet...me), so I will be presenting the budget in that beloved chapel...and yeah, she was going to do food for the retreat too, so that will be someone else...me? ha ha
So yeah...went on a walk tonight, just to clear my head a bit, pray and chat with the Big Guy...probably looked crazy talking to myself :) and yeah, crying a bit ha ha. The year just makes me so nervous...well, a healthy nervous I say - I know that God's got it, and I am absolutely certain this year is going to be amazing...I just really want it to be amazing, and it scares me to death that it won't be. We have such a great team, but the one thing, now that Petra is gone, I am the only person that has been on STUCA before so yeah...that will be a weird adjustment. Anyway...I could ramble on for hours about the things I am nervous about and worried about and the things that I am SO excited for...so I will just leave it at that...
I would love and greatly appreciate prayers for the year and for the leadership. I SO desperately want the students to have a year that just draws them so close to God in their personal walk. A year that glorifies Him. A year in which we have SO much fun, and build SO many great relationships, but one that avoids cliques and the stupid issues of boy/girl dynamics (now I am dreaming!!).&nbsp;I am actually excited to have the apartment to myself for the next 12 or so days. I desperately want these 18 days before Training Week and this perfect time of solitude to just really help me get my mind and heart focused and prepared for the year. So yeah...just a really great time of chatting it up with God, being honest about my fears and just rejoicing in His greatness...
So yeah, there I go again.
I cleaned basically the whole apartment tonight and I think I will pack just a little before bed :)"

"event","<p><font size=""2"">Hey Hey Hey</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">It's the time of the night when I should be sleeping, or at least thinking about being tired...and yet...here I sit, typing away. Actually, all three of us are still awake. That is a VERY rare occasion. </font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">Kala and Chelsey are packing up as they move their stuff to their house on Monday/Tuesday. Then they are there for a few days before they both leave for New Brunswick (on separate trips). So I have the apartment to myself!! PAR-TAY :)</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">BUT, them packing has REALLY gotten me into the packing mood!! Like tonight I started sorting some things to take home to my parents' to leave there, threw some stuff out, took a few decorations down...etc. But I refuse to take my pictures down until a few days before. That would just make me too sad! So yeah, I feel like school is tomorrow!! Like I am going to wake up and it will be training week...that isn't good, because now I will be excited and then sad for 22 more days. BUT, it is only 22 MORE DAYS :) That is very exciting.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">In other news, I bought the stupid wrong top-up card for my cell phone. I was really tired and coming home from work but I figured I would pick it up before going home. And then I bought the 25 (plus tax), non-refundable card and it was the wrong stupid one!! I couldn't believe it. What an idiot I am. BUT, and thank You God!! My Grandma uses that kind!! Seriously, not many use top-up cards, so to find someone needing a Bell top-up card, what a miracle! I was so happy!!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">Kala and I went to Walmart tonight. Walked on over. It was so beautiful out! Got a fitted bedsheet because mine was crap. And pens and the funnest and greatest binder ever for STUCA. But it is only a 1-incher. Oh well, it is the greatest, so I will make it work! Shades of pink, brown, green and white in stripes on the outside and polka dots on the inside...It's a Hot Chocolate brand binder&nbsp;:)</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">Yesterday was a WONDERFUL day :) I thought I wouldn't really be doing anything...I went to work, and was on my way home at 1:30 when Pepperdine and Michelle Mack picked me up! Mack was in town for the day, so the three of us hung out. Hit up the mall for a bit, then we went to Chuck E. Cheese to play games and get our pictures down on the sketch thing! It was my very FIRST time there! What a deprived childhood I had ha ha. But yeah, it was hilarious. </font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">Then, when I came home, Shelby had emailed asking if I wanted to have supper with her and the girls (Brad and the boys are at camp this week). I figured it was too late as I got home at like 5:40...but...(thank You God!!) the girls had had late naps and had gotten up around 5:00, so they hadn't eaten either!! So, Shelby, Delaney, Addison and Carmen picked me up and we went to Pizza Hut. I love those girls!! Some of my very favourite people in the whole entire world :)&nbsp;&nbsp;It was&nbsp;like a belated birthday dinner because things got Hectic with the end of Forward/East Coast trip around my birthday. And I got my gift&nbsp; - a nice book and a nice journal :) yay. So yeah, loved it. The kids are cute and well, Shelby is my life partner so...ha ha. But seriously, I always think that some people assume we are actually&nbsp;'together' when we are out...ha ha funny story about a&nbsp;dimly lit booth at Fifty's Diner one time ha ha. So yeah, we had dinner and then went to Zehrs. Yay for time with the Somers Girls :)</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">Next week I have all early morning shifts, which is actually okay...then I have my whole day left. The only problem is that it messes up my system - because I never go to bed early, but I have to get up early. It isn't good. And it messes up my eating kind of - I eat breakfast before work...like a muffin or a banana or something. And then an apple (or banana) and a Diet Coke on break. And then I get home and it is usually about 1:30 or 2:00...so I'm not really hungry for lunch...so I kick around for a bit and then eat an early supper and have like applesauce later for an after supper snack...but anyways...nothing of huge concern.</font></p>
<p><font face=""Trebuchet MS""><font size=""2"">It has been SOOOO nice to have my relatives here from BC. We really only see them maybe every 1.5 years, and we probably see my uncle less than that...and they are so great! My uncle Darrin&nbsp;(mother's other brother) is SO hilarious, and my aunt is fun too, plus Emma is just the sweetest thing!! ha ha the other day I was swimming beside her (she is getting really good...and just 4) and she was trying to get to her mom, but her mom was on a raft and the jets were pushing my aunt Karyn away. Emma, trying to get to her, shouted out (not panicky, just jovial like), ""aren't you going to save your child?!"" HA HA oh man, she is so cute. And then her and my uncle were playing Little Mermaid and he would lift her up and she would stretch out her arms and legs and tilt her head back and hum the Ariel song (it was like a Titanic pose) ha ha. And then she made us all join the story. Curt was Scuttle, I was King Titan, mom was Sebastian, Grandma was Flounder, and Emma would tell everyone what they were supposed to be doing, it was funny. So yeah, I have actually been able to swim with them...like 5 separate afternoons? So that has been great (and that is without taken days off of work...God just arranged my schedule so I would have times to be able to be at Grandma's when they were there!! God is So great!!). My uncle left Tuesday morning and the girls leave next Tuesday. Emma phoned me today telling me she made me a bracelet. It was SO cute :) She wanted to tell me and tell me she loved me in case she didn't see me again!! So sweet!<br /></font><font face=""Trebuchet MS""><br /><font size=""2"">I was the ""guest speaker"" at youth group on Wednesday. We play sports or go swimming every Wednesday in the summer and then a leader gives their testimony with a challenge sort of thing. I think it went well...who knows really :)</font><font size=""2""> In giving my testimony, I basically just summed up the first 19.5 years with- I was born in Cambridge and have lived here ever since, I have attended Forward since I was 14 days old and I accepted Christ at age 4...that about sums up that. ha ha And then just talked about these past few months and how it has been a crazy bit of surprises. I told them about the raccoon story with the dumpster and how that symbolized my&nbsp;whole summer because it sure has been a summer of suprises! -&nbsp;with the whole living situation and then my job and then did the Esther 4:14 wrap up and talked about how my roommates and I have been looking at Esther this summer and discovering a story of God's redemptive plan using ordinary, screwed up people (well, that part was worded different ha ha) and then the whole using whatever circumstance you are in for God wrap-up for a clean ten minutes (I think). So yeah, there you go. I didn't have any notes, I was pretty proud of myself for that :) I like doing stuff like that...but at the same time, I almost feel like I don't know whwy I am because there is someone else that could easily say it better than I could...but I do like it or whatever. And it is good because I know a lot of the kids and have built relationships with many of them, so I do want to be able to talk to them about this stuff. It was fun.&nbsp;<br /><br />I think I finally hit my tired stride. And of course, I am the last one up, even though I work at 10:00 tomorrow, the earliest of the 3 of us! Oh man, maybe I should try and CATCH UP on my sleep before school!! That sounds like a good idea...<br /><br />Oh, and I really just want to know my roommates...right now!!</font></font></font></p>"

"event","Shortly after my last entry, my keyboard did indeed stop working altogether. I had to go with my mouse and copy and paste individual letters, spaces, numbers&nbsp;and periods to form an adequate MSN name ha ha. Thankfully my dad is really great and paid for the new one for me - it was only like 17 bucks though, such a great deal and it is simple but perfect and was the only one left in the store!! Thank You God.
Actually been fairly busy lately.&nbsp;And am subsequently tired sitting here. Just had a short nap at my parents' and then came and read/laid down on my bed...just made me more sleepy and soon I have to lead Bible Study.
Friday I worked 10:30-4:00 and then went straight to babysit for Brad and Shelby. That was great of course, though by the time I got home at 1:00am, I was pretty tired! They came home when the wedding at 12:00ish, but of course Shelby and I chatted a fair bit before I headed off...and even so we always have to say goodbye at least a couple of times because&nbsp;it just always seems like there's something to say! Went swimming with the kids, ate some dinner, watched a VeggieTales...Delaney played with my hair in her little ""salon"" (she even brought me magazines to look at! ha ha) And Addison said she loved my ""hair-dude"" ha ha. Then there was the bed process and singing the goodnight song (a song they always sing before bed...their parents made it up). When we were getting ready to sing it, Seth was like, ""Do you know it, Katie?"" I was like, ""Yes, I know it, I have been babysitting for you guys for a long time!!"" (they have sung it basically since their first kid...and they have five ha ha) He was like, ""Yeah, like three times!!"" ha ha no Seth, since Delaney was about a year and a half...so about 5.5 years!! Too funny.
Saturday I had off. One of my first Saturdays off in a LONG time (I requested it off, or else I would hav ebeen working). So I slept at my parents' on Friday, chilled at home, then went swimming with everyone. Been swimming a fair amount with Darrin, Karyn, and Emma - SO nice to have them here!! Then had a nap in the afternoon (swimming with a 4 year old...catching her, swimming with her, catching her) is very fun but quite tiring! I love it though :) Then Saturday night was Jay and Jackie's after-wedding reception. They got married in Jamaica at the end of April so they had a reception and dance Saturday at the Police Club (where my mom and dad had theirs too). It was an Island theme. Very fun. The food was really good. BBQ chicken, roast beef, 4 kinds of salads, veggies, etc...lots of good food. And tons of desserts. Chocolate mousse, cherry cheesecake, black forest cake, lemon meringue, apple pie, cherry pie, banana bread...lots!!
And then there was the dance of course!! ha ha so funny!!! Surprisingly, basically none of the drunk people danced. Jackie's family danced and then us Baptists danced a fair bit. It was SO fun ha ha. We just like being really weird and goofy WAY too much to not get out there! ha ha Oh man, and I am so naive or something ha ha it was funny. I kept getting really paranoid that they might accidentally put something in my Coke/Diet Coke (all beverages, even water came from the bar) it was hilarious! And everyone thought my Uncle Darrin was HAMMERED because he likes to dance with one foot planted and then just jerk his body around in any which way...he is HILARIOUS!! It became the joke of the night that he was completely sober!!
We took Sunday off and just relaxed. Watched the videos of us dancing. Had some lunch. And then everyone (including the BC clan, and Jay and Jackie) stayed and went swimming, had supper, played games - but I had to work. Which was a shame, but I need money so, oh well. But I only had to work 8:30-12:30 today so I could go swimming this afternoon with Emma and Karyn and Darrin. Plus, this was Darrin's last day as he leaves tomorrow morning back to Hope, BC (the girls stay one more week).
But, I had the next two days off, so that is nice. And I get to/have to give my testimony on Wednesday for youth. Well, like a five minute-what God has been doing...so pray for that!! Just praying for what God wants me to share, how to communicate it, etc. So that is that.
Oh, and I have been really thinking a lot about prayer lately. I was walking home from work on Sunday and witnessed what looked like a possible family feud of sorts. A boy, Mike (I heard the other guy say his name), walking and this truck pulled up and the kid just ignored him. Then he started shouting at him, throwing out some curse words, and threw his hat and stomped off.&nbsp;
I hated seeing it. I felt so helpless. And like, I didn't know them, I didn't know the situation, I just hated knowing that it was happening, that there was this stress for them. So I just prayed for them. As I watched the older guy (his dad maybe I thought) drive after him, call out&nbsp; ""please just stop and talk to me for a second"", drive after, pick up his hat, etc. and the kid (well, probably 17, maybe older) storm off, curse, bang his fists against the wooden pole...I just hated it.
But seeing that, and praying for them, desperately wishing I could pray for them by name, I just felt/remembered the awesomeness of prayer and just realized how rarely I take advantage of its power. Prayer can seem fruitless - we can't measure its power, we don't know if it's 'working', but it is SO important. It helps us communicate with God, learn to lean on Him, talk to Him, take everything to Him. It shows our trust in Him to work in people's lives. There is a quote and I know I have it written somewhere, but I can't find it. A visting pastor said it once when I was younger and it stood out to me. I am definitely going to butcher its eloquency by paraphrasing it but it was something like: Prayer is the only weapon that can be used at any time, can be used against all forces, and can be sent to any part of the world just with a thought. That was the main idea anyway. Prayer is unstoppable!! I can't believe I don't use it more often. So anyway, that is what I am trying to do lately. Really, just to pray. When I am bored at my till, pray. For my coworkers, for my customers...and with prayer, just listening to God's prompting. It is cool to just sit and listen and then have a name pop into your head...and who knows, maybe my brain brought that name to mind, but maybe God did and they need prayer. In a summer when I don't feel I can accomplish much in my job,&nbsp;I think it's time to start taking advantage of something I can do 24/7 and that can have a lasting impact.
That is all.
On a less serious note, I picked up the STUCA shirts today and I like them."

"event","<p>Okay, so this weekend was the very unexpected Heritage Reunion weekend!<br />It was crazy how many people I got to see (yay) and definitely some wicked sweet times!<br />So Saturday I worked and it was death! ha ha not really, but it was SO busy. We have this crazy huge ""One Dollar Sale"" on right now...so many things for a dollar, so it was nuts. Got home tired (I had to wake up at like 8:15) at like 3:00. At 3:30, I went to Jacob to play soccer with Heritage people. But only me, Jacob, Brendan, Jackman and her friend Judy showed. So 2 on 2 anyone? SO TIRING!! ha ha But it was fun, and it sprinkled a bit which helped the old ""it's so hot I am going to die"" factor.<br />Came back. Saw Dallas' short hair. Got ready. Then Cliff, Lindsay and myself took off - went to Walmart so they could get pop and I could get a sweet pool toy :) ha ha I am SO cool!! Then we were on the road again...and we made it there in one piece without even getting close to lost, we were so good!! ha ha<br />But, we did get stuck behind this stupid transport for a bit. I was being patient and waiting to see if it would speed up (it was seriously going 80 on the 401), but it didn't. Stupid Werner (it had WERNER on the back of the truck...weird...so now, any driver you don't like, call them Werner :) ha ha).&nbsp;<br />So yeah, got to Brady's. And by the time the last person came there were a whole bunch of us!! Woohoo. Brady, Krystal, Cliff, Lindsay, Me, Ben, Dallas, Julie, Kristine, Laurie, Jess, Hence, Ben, Jared. Yeah, good times! So we swam, we played the animal game, we played colours, we hot-tubbed it, we ate hotdog, hamburgers and other things of deliciousness. We chatted, we listened to some wonderful musically-inclined people sing and play, the girls played cards!! ha ha ha SO FUNNY. If anyone ever wants to have a good time...play cheat with Lindsay and Laurie...or any card game with them as a matter of fact! But yeah, good times. So fun. Chatted some more. Headed out around 1:00. Basically everyone headed back to Heritage so the party could continue!! ha ha All the girls bunked in my apartment and the guys in Cliff's. I always thought I had a lot of blankets, but spread between 5 people, not so much!! ha ha So yeah, got back at 1:30, went to get eggs for breakfast and then Julie, Kristine, Krystal, Laurie and I talked till 4:00ish. Well, Kristine fell asleep...but she worked all day in the sun and had to get up really early on Sunday. Julie ended up sleeping on the recliner, Kristine on the couch, Laurie in my bed, Krystal in the spare and I took the floor with the bean bag as a nice head rest. It was lovely. Krystal and I chatted till about 4:30 and then she fell asleep. I never do well falling asleep at sleepover. I am always so excited or something and I can't sleep. So I just started praying for everyone and then fell asleep around 5:00ish. </p>
<p>Krystal and I&nbsp;got up at 8:00 to make breakfast...coffee was already brewing for us :) Poor Julie had switched to the couch after Kristine left and then&nbsp;we told her she could take&nbsp;a bed while we made breakfast...apparently she slept alright though, so that's good! So we all ate breakfast and&nbsp;got ready and then this&nbsp;HUGE crew of people&nbsp;went to Forward :) Me, Krystal, Julie, Laurie, Naomi, Noelle, Craig, Kala, Chelsey,&nbsp;Jacob,&nbsp;Dallas, Brady, Ben and Cliff. Woah. Just like old times! And BRAD, SHELBY AND THE KIDS WERE THERE!! :)&nbsp;Yay. I almost started crying when I hugged Shelby. Theme of the weekend...tired people cry ha ha...it happened far too often - coming home Saturday, singing about Heaven and you know...got sad ha ha...Sunday morning with Shelby...<br />And then I drove the girls back to Heritage, they grabbed their stuff and headed out to lunch and from there home. I had to get ready to work. Cried when they left, I don't even know why...I mean, being tired and like a realization our fun weekend was ending? I have no idea ha ha. Work. I was SO tired and it was SO busy. And had a tired headached. And was sore from soccer. And was sore from sleeping on the floor. But those are my fault, so I can't complain ha ha. And one of my managers, Cheryl, almost made me cry at work. ha ha oh man. Who would've thought eh? Katie...almost cry...at work. It just doesn't happen. It has happened once before - the almost cry at work. It was at the library :) This one not super friendly lady told me the pants I was wearing that day (the same pair/style I had been wearing there for at least a year and a half) weren't allowed and I wasn't allowed to wear them again blah blah. And I got so teary - I am not here to make trouble and I just didn't understand, I always wore them! And she wasn't nice...boo...ha ha<br />But yeah, today - it was SO busy and that means Cheryl was stressed of course and whenever we have voids of a certain amount, we have to get the person with the key to come key off on the purchase. Anyway, I had two within a couple minutes that needed to be keyed off on and the first time she was frustrated and then when it happened again (like sorry, but it's the rules...the customer seriously can't check out until it is keyed off on if there is a big void...sorry the customer is stupid and changed their mind ha ha) when I called her at her till, I looked at her and she was so mad. And I she comes over, didn't really say much, but she is just real moody and not over friendly and just made me feel like I sucked at my job (plus I was really tired) and yeah, almost cried. Oh man ha ha. But yeah, like this Cheryl, can be so friendly and nice and then switch so fast! But she is mostly nice to her friends, and not to just new people who she doesn't know...oh well. Like she didn't mean anything, it was just frustrating because it was busy and whatever, but yeah.<br />And then I got an email from Shelby tonight and teared up again ha ha.<br />Oh yeah, and another WEIRDEST DREAM EVER the other night. Can't be described on blog though...FAR too confusing. Ask me sometime. What I will say, and it was hilarious, was that when my alarm went off (in real life), I was driving a car (in my dream) and I was awake because I knew it was my alarm, but was still kind of dreaming, because for a minute, I got REALLY confused because I was like, ""Well, I can't turn off my alarm because I am driving!! I can't just take my hands off the wheel!!"" ha ha ha it was so funny.<br />Alright, surprisingly, I think I am heading to bed. I may be sleeping by like 10:30. Woah. Woah indeed.</p>"

I forgot about my dreams...
The first one is FAR too confusing for any sort of comprehension...I will just tell you there was a huge textbook burning party at Heritage which was also Food Basics and at Food Basics (which was also Heritage ha ha) I had to sell oil cigarettes to this girl...but first of course I had to figure out how much oil = one pack of cigarettes...that was hard! ha ha...and there was a freak snowstorm but it was almost more inside than out because the grass was green...and yeah, that is just the start, but I won't go any further :) ha ha I am so weird!
The second was just after I had talked to Laurie on MSN and she had mentioned she got her bathing suit at Giant Tiger...
So, in my dream, Laurie and I were at Giant Tiger looking at bathing suits, but they were ALL ugly and ALL of them had a skirt with it...like a long skirt! ha ha Then we went to this back corner where the winter stuff was, and we were looking at belts ha ha. I wanted to buy one for my jeans, but Laurie said - you can't wear a belt with jeans! I wouldn't ever wear one with jeans even if they were way too big! And then this girl Laurie knew came over and told her she could have a free lunch on her mall card or something. So we went to have lunch. There were now some more people with us I think. But before we left, we looked in the storage room at the very back, and every single thing was RED. Weird. So yeah, we were walking towards the Food Court when we saw my Grandpa and Grandma. Yeah, that made me really happy in the dream, and really said as soon as I woke up :( But I got to see them and talk to them for a minute and I got to hug my Grandpa and hear his voice (and yes I am tearing up right now ha ha). And that was about it.
As a side note, I have had at least three or four dreams this summer where I have seen my grandpa. So weird."

"event","Another grand week in the life and times of Katie...
Today marks 37 days until Training Week.
Tuesday night was the arrival of my uncle Darrin, aunt Karyn and little 4 year-old cousin Emma from BC.
Tomorrow night is a pool party at Brady's.
In a series of wonderful events, I got Wednesday off and could hang out with the BC arrivals at Grandma's all day. Mom, Curt and I headed over around 11:30 to join Jay, Grandma and the BCers around the pool. Curt and I were quickly motioned in by Emma. Curt and I had the pleasure of playing Polly Pockets: pool style, with Emma and everyone had the pleasure, numerous times of hearing: catch me's and I'm going to swim to you's...a very eventful afternoon. Also, as Emma tells us, ""white butterflies are really popular around here"", ""icing is very delicious"" and ""the water is very refreshing""...quite the words coming from a 4 year old. I spent my fair share of time in the water. From about 12:00-1:30 and 2:30-5:00, most of the time centering my attention around our little bundle of joy - though I did manage some time for laying on the boat and tanning :) Emma and I did some pool dancing, A LOT of swimming, reading some books...lets just say I was tired after!
We were also informed of a little phrase Emma made it. We have no idea why, but instead of saying ""a little bit"" she always says ""a slinch bit"". So weird! But quite hilarious, and it caught on quick...I dare you all to try and not say...it has already snuck into my vocab :) And, she is ready to show you the exact measurement of a slinch bit - shown&nbsp;by using your thumb and second finger, in my words, it is about one finger's height - or about 1 cm. So there you, a slinch bit.
And yesterday, Emma called my parents' house and my mom told her they would be over to swim right after they dropped me off where I live. And in the background she could hear Emma yell to my Grandma, ""Aunt Sanny (well, that's what it sounds like anyway) and Curtis are coming swimming after they bring Katie back where she belongs!! ha ha I love that kid.

And for more excitement, last night I won a Warren Barfield autographed t-shirt on myspace.com. ha ha. Seriously. He posted this contest and you had to post this one song of his on your profile and then if by chance he clicked on your profile and it was there, you won. And apparently I was the first of the winners. So there you go. Weird!

And tomorrow, after work, Jackman is getting a bunch of people together to play soccer at Jacob. So that should be great - good old fashioned intramural fun! And then tomorrow evening is the pool party. Not exactly sure everyone who will be there, but at least me, Kristine, Krystal, Brady, Jess, Laurie, maybe Julie, Cliff, Lindsay, Ben?, other Ben? so yeah - very excited. Swimming? LOVE. Friends? LOVE. Good times all around."

"event","Here ants, come feast on these scrumptious sausages...oh wait! Those are Katie's legs!!
Did I tell you this was the summer where animals strike back, or did I tell you?
So this morning I woke up to the phone - a co-worker, Lora, was hoping I could take her 2:30-8:00 shift at work today. I initially said no because Petra and I had planned a date tonight and I didn't think I would be able to tell her in time (she works today). I automatically regretted my decision, but decided I would take today and really just relax - read, pray, swim :) then hang out with Petra before our roommate bible study. About twenty minutes later, Lora phones back. I guess she had a dentist appointment and no one will switch and our boss is being less than fun (a trait that we have become used to seeing...she isn't always the most enthusiastic and joyous person), so I said I would switch. Thank you God! 5.5 more hours in this very low week of just 20 hours, He is good :)
So I got up, got ready, made some rice and then decided to go outside to eat, read and soak in a few more rays. I started on the benches with my yummy lunch and equally yummy book :) enjoying the gorgeous weather. After a bit I moved over to the hill, resting against one of the flagpoles. After some time I noticed the large amounts of ants in the area...I check for an ant hill...nope. Oh well, no harm, no foul. As they made their way across my fleshy terrain (ha ha), I simply picked them up and threw them away. I felt some prickles, but don't you always when sitting on grass with shorts on?? After awhile though, the number of ants was rather ridiculous, so I decided to call it a day and come inside. It was only after arriving back in the cool of my room that I looked to the back of my legs and...covered in ANT BITES. And yes, I mean that extremely literally. Covered. In ant bites.&nbsp;
This confused me a bit, all the ants were black. Were we not told as children that only red ants bites?? Oh, how we were led astray...
So there you go. Katie's Summer Where Animals Truly Hate Her continues..."

"event","<p>It seems that all I can seem to blog about is the things of seriousness lately. Oh well, being serious is grand. I enjoy pondering life.<br />So today was great. Did the old swim 'n tan at Grandma's with Naomi, Chantel (McDonald) and Jackman...plus like my whole family was there. So good times all around. Out there for about 3 hours - trying to catch up to Kristine :) And at the end, after already swimming laps and such - we had a treading water competition. Jackman and I lasted 45 minutes before Naomi made us stop and go home. Then, Naomi, Chantel and I, plus their roommate Tiffany and her fiance Tim went to the Embassy. A lovely ""church service"" if you will for college-aged students held at the Waterloo Rec Centre. Oh memories. Oh my. It was the first time I had been there (on Father David Bauer Drive!! ha ha love that street name) since the afternoon of many accidents. Oh the flashbacks. So we went there and met up with two friends of the group - Curtis and Luke. Well, Curtis' last name is DeGraaf...a cousin of people I went to school with. And Luke's last name is Devos...who I went to school with. And Luke's brother&nbsp;Mark was there - who was in&nbsp;my grade and went to school with for elementary and high school. Plus, David Purkiss, Nathan Graham, Spencer Dougley, and Dave DeGeir were there (all from elementary school - the first&nbsp;3 in my&nbsp;grade). Plus good old ""Super"" ha ha Richard Baverstock (church) and then Shelly's Tay. So yeah, pretty much everyone ha ha. After that we went to Dairy Queen -&nbsp;Mark and I&nbsp;caught up an old classmates, etc. Turns out he is switching from more business-oriented to becoming a pastor! Very excited for him. And I was happy to inform him that I&nbsp;now talk to people and am not so obsessive about my grades!&nbsp;Double yay :) But yeah, so fun - he is such a funny guy. ha ha<br />But yes, the serious stuff.<br />I love the&nbsp;Embassy. Such a great outreach and they do&nbsp;so many great things.&nbsp;<br />I am sure this has happened to everyone,&nbsp;but I will still ask, has&nbsp;any of you ever been sitting in a church service and get so wrapped up in everything because you are SURE that the message is solely for you? You know, you are sitting there ""amen-ing"" (maybe out loud, maybe silently), nodding your head, everything is clicking - you are writing notes&nbsp;like crazy and get so tuned in to the speaker that&nbsp;in that moment of coming out of the daze you are actually surprised to be sitting next to someone because you have become so convinced it is simply&nbsp;the speaker talking&nbsp;only to you? Well anyway, I had that moment tonight.<br />The words in the songs we sang were perfect. I&nbsp;almost couldn't keep my hands down. Let my words&nbsp;be few, God of wonders - a lot of really powerful lyrics. And then the guy (Dom - for Domenic - Ruso)&nbsp;got up to speak.&nbsp;They are doing a series called ""Unconscious Living"" and attempting to show us how little things we do, usually without realizing it, greatly effects the way we view God, the way we worship, etc. Tonight was on the sin of efficiency.<br />I always get a little&nbsp;iffy about subjects that don't seem directly related to Scripture. I love to hear messages on passages, that show&nbsp;us&nbsp;Christ in new ways etc,&nbsp;but this was really great. He attempted to show us how everything in our lives is fast, how we have stopped just trying to listen. He began&nbsp;with Mark 4:24-25, ""Then He said to them, ""Take heed what you hear. With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given.<sup> </sup>For whoever has, to him more will be given; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.""&nbsp;If we are not intent on listening, we will not only not get what He is trying to say, we will miss out on other things.<br />The speaker used a lot of good illustrations, but one I really like was the fact that a lot of us have day planners, or at least schedules of sometime, and often, anything that doesn't fit, we consider to be a waste of time. His illustration was that often he will be sitting in his office with this great to-do list when someone will come in for what seems to be a quick question. He says often the interuption is unwanted and he really just needs to get back to work (a feeling I know I, unfortunately, have felt before) After answering the question he will realize that there seems to be a deeper issue and he probes as to the underlying issue. Sometimes it will be an hour later when this person leaves. Upon their leaving, he is embarassed to admit that he thought that would be a waste of time. I know I can relate. I so often elevate my to-do list above so much else. Well after this I will have time for prayer...and after this I will have time to email them and after...Does this happen to anyone else, or is it just me?<br />The speaker continued with some really great quotes. The first two are by Eugene Petersen, the author of The Message, ""The question I put to myself is not, 'How many people have you spoken to Christ about this week?', but 'How many people have you listened to in Christ this week?'"" Is that not the ticket? In this fast-paced world, we forget the importance of listening. Listening has no value (which will be discussed), so it is often forgotten. The next quote says, ""We live in the Trinity. Everything we do has to be in the context of the Trinity, which means personally, relationally. The minute you start doing thigns impersonally, functionally, mass-oriented, you deny this very purpose.""<br />He then introduces the second half of the story introduced by Mark 4:24-25. Mark 4:26-29 says, ""And He said, ""The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,<sup> </sup>and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.<sup> </sup>For the earth yields crops by itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head.<sup> </sup>But when the grain ripens, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.""<br />It will only ever be in listening that we truly understand. He starts to introduce the apsect of time with this quote: ""As soon as we start to parcel up time, the tables turn and time takes over."" (Carl Honore) and then continues with this brilliant (I feel), quote by Einstein, ""Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted, counts.""<br />Take prayer for example (and he talked a lot about this). Prayer can't be counted. We will never know how much our prayer was worth, or what good it did. We will never be able to say, well, it was 36 hours and 10 minutes from the time I prayed till the time the prayer was answered. In the eyes of efficiency, prayer is completely worthless. And in a world that is moving towards efficiency, and as we seek to accomplish more, do more, earn more, know more, etc. prayer gets forgotten. The more we live in efficiency, and the less we allow ourselves time to ponder life, to listen to God, to pray, we are denying God opportunities to break into our life. As we live in efficiency, we demand to know why changes in our life are taking so long, why situations take so long to change, when will the money come, when will the pain end...we demand time but refuse to listen and WAIT.&nbsp;Another quote used was by Neil Postman that says, ""The engine of technological progress worked most efficiently when people are conceived not as children of God but consumers.""<br />The speaker finished with this thought from Isaiah 55:8-9, ""For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,"" declares the LORD. As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts."" How are we to know God and His will? LISTEN.<br /><br />So anyway, you could say that it hit me tonight. My summer. It hasn't really been what I expected. Less money, less hours, less fun, less friends...A LOT more TIME. I realized this right away. From the beginning of summer I said - you know, there is a lot going on, but I really think this summer is really just meant for me to grow closer to God. He has blessed me SO much with a job and a place to live and now, all this time. My plan was for this summer to really just learn to depend on Him first, listen to Him first for everything.&nbsp;<br />And then...the excitement started to wear a little bit, and even as I kept trusting He would provide money and all that, there starting to get some doubt, and I started to miss people more...and then tonight I was hit with a pretty big load of some pretty haeavy bricks.<br />I started to think...you know...I have been really considering my summer for these last few weeks and really having this ache in my heart for my summer to mean something...I felt like I wasn't doing anything. I thought this ache was because I wasn't working with kids or because my job doesn't really allow for much impact...but it is only, and seriously right in this very moment, that I have come to realize that this ache is simply because I am not doing what I set out to do this summer - KNOW God and LISTEN to Him. Simply put, that is it. I don't need to be changing the whole world right now, I really believe I just need to learn to listen.<br />And while I have been thankful all along the road, it is in this moment, as I eat my chips and dip and ponder,&nbsp;that I am truly thankful for this summer.&nbsp;<br />Consider what I believed was my ideal summer - Popcorn House/Food Basics. Lots of hours. Lots of stress. Pretty good money. No time. No time for road trips. No time for friends to visit. Very lonely. Very stressed. No time for swimming. No time for relaxing. No time to help out with youth group. No time off. Getting little sleep. Getting a lot of stress. Getting pretty good money. Concentrating on God during my nightly devotions but most likely not having much time to think about him during the day. Concentrating on lack of sleep, lack of time to visit friends, and lack of time to relax.<br />However, I have received God's ideal summer for me: Food Basics (part-time). Not too many hours. Not too much money. Lots of time. Lots of time to swim. Lots of time to visit friends. Lots of time for exercising, personal growth and making new friends. Time for family. Time for youth group. TIME FOR GOD. Hardly any stress.<br /><br />The difference? My summer gave me money and stress. God's summer has given me a chance to trust in Him for my future and given me LOTS of time to get to know Him more. I think it is finally time to realize what an amazing summer God has given me and to start making the most of the days instead of complaining or worrying. I think we all know I could use a break and a lot of God time...especially considering the fall will bring: School, Work, Volleyball, Youth Group, Living in Dorm and Being the President. Yeah...pretty sure I should take this summer to rest up :)<br /><br />For those who beared with me and actually made it to the end of this entry...may the Lord bless you for your patience...goodness knows it takes a lot with me! :)<br /><br /></p>"

"event","Okay, so obviously I have been thinking a lot about relationships...for the last...long while. This question has been one that has really caught my attention:<br />How do you love someone you just don't get along with?<br /><br />I mean, let's just be real for a minute. You aren't going to get along with everyone. That is life. But there is that finer than fine line that goes between&nbsp;loving someone and simply giving someone the respect and love they deserve but not going out of your way for them.<br /><br />Every single person deserves respect and love. Or, think about it this way, every single person deserves all the same things you deserve. What do you wish for yourself? Happiness, love, peace, prosperity, friendships, joy, a great job, a loving family, a nice house...<br /><br />Who knows who these people are to you, to me...those people that you love because you need to and they deserve it, but not because you necessarily want to. Or, in many cases, you simply just don't 'mesh' with that person - so you do what you need to do to ensure you are respecting them, but don't bother to go out of your way.<br /><br />All of this is quite natural. No one has enough time, energy or resources to go out of their way for every individual they come in contact with. And sometimes, personalities just don't mix. But then there's the ticket - how in the world do you make sure that you are loving them? If these people are those who you don't necessarily mesh with, it is likely you will become easily agitated around or with them. I think that is simply human. But how does one suppress those feelings of frustration and continue to conduct oneself in a way that is full of integrity and love? And where is that line between loving someone and going out of your way for someone?<br /><br />There is that phrase - unconditional love. UNconditional Love. Now that is a toughy. And you know why? Because every single person deserves it. Everyone deserves to be loved unconditionally. Humanly speaking, sometimes we just suck at loving people. We always have to criticize. Or hold grudges. Or judge people. Or choose not to forgive people. I suck at it all the time. All the time I blow it. And here I am talking about sucking at loving people who I truly love with all my heart. And if I can't manage to love those who are close to my heart, how is it possible to love those who are merely acquaintances or friends of the past...<br /><br />We were talking about this at roommate bible study a couple weeks ago. We were talking about if there have every been people who you just can't stand - and how are we called to treat them. That is when I brought up the unconditional love vs. you can't go out of your way for everyone thing. The only example I could think of was something along the lines of:<br />--Say someone you really don't get along with comes to your apartment. You let them in and they start spilling this sob story of heartache and sorrow that is present in their life. It is only right, if they have come to you and desperately need your listening&nbsp;ear, to listen to them, to show them love&nbsp;in their time of need. However, it isn't as if you need to go out and buy them flowers and a gift card because they are having a crappy week (which you might do for someone else). You simply&nbsp;can't do that for everyone.--<br /><br />However, I now go back on my previous position. Did Jesus not love everyone, unconditionally and as much as He possibly could, that came into His path? Is this not the example we are to follow?? Granted, we are humans and simply seeking after the lifestyle He has presented. So, in this already but not yet world, we will never achieve perfection, and thus, our relationships or our attitudes towards our relationships will never be perfect. But I don't think it is right to simply accept that they will never be perfect and move along making the best of things...we are to constantly seek after Christ, know Him more, become more and more the image of our Creator. So does this mean we seek to love every single person to the best of our ability, even go out of our way for them? I guess I am greatly persuaded towards saying yes but knowing that prayer and my Saviour and going to be going along with me as I seek to even attempt this.<br /><br />And that's all I've really got. I mean, I could honestly talk about this, or talk about anything really, forever. I love just thinking through stuff, contemplating, hearing&nbsp;other people's views...it is really quite fascinating - how one topic can be viewed in so many different perspectives...what an amazing God we have to give us such imaginative and creative minds!<br /><br />These aren't all my thoughts. Simply the thoughts that came&nbsp;out&nbsp;before my mind decided I didn't have&nbsp;enough energy to continue. Maybe I will come back to it at a later date.<br />To close: 1 John 4:7-21<br />7 Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:8&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">8</a></sup></strong>Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:9&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">9</a></sup></strong>This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:10&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">10</a></sup></strong>This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:11&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">11</a></sup></strong>Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:12&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">12</a></sup></strong>No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. <br /><strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:13&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">13</a></sup></strong>We know that we live in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:14&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">14</a></sup></strong>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:15&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">15</a></sup></strong>If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him and he in God. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:16&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">16</a></sup></strong>And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. <br />God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:17&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">17</a></sup></strong>In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him.<strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:18&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">18</a></sup></strong>There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. <br /><strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:19&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">19</a></sup></strong>We love because he first loved us. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:20&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">20</a></sup></strong>If anyone says, ""I love God,"" yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. <strong><sup><a href=""http://www.studylight.org/desk/?query=1jo+4:21&amp;sr=1&amp;t=niv"">21</a></sup></strong>And he has given us this command: Whoever loves God must also love his brother.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;"

"event","<p>Okay, remind me never to wait this long to blog again. Not like I haven't blogged twice in the last half hour...but you know, it's been almost a week since I actually wrote something for real.&nbsp;<br />So, now it is time to recap and tell all my stories.<br />Before I start, Krystal, I love you, and am going to email you as soon as I finish this...I have to wait until I can concentrate, and I simply can't until I tell my stories...so in the slim chance that you read this first...I am emailing soon :)<br />Alright, so basically I had the best week of my summer. For real.<br />Monday and Tuesday was the after-weekend weekend with Kristine and Friends. How wonderful :) Kristine came Monday after lunch and I definitely couldn't wait! Like, it had&nbsp;been 10 weeks and I miss her like crazy! So yeah, we hung out that afternoon and were trying to figure out what to do that night. I mean, we had a car, so like she said, ""the whole world is on our shoulders"" ha ha. Pretty much. So anyway, we were both in agreeance that we needed to road trip it somewhere, anywhere really...I was like...what about Waggles? Because neither of us had seen her and I knew she would be super stoked to be surprised! We discussed the London and/or Hamilton possibilities, but Baxter had originally said that she would come up and we would see Krystal tomorrow (plus she was working and would only be able to visit for a couple of minutes), so we were London-bound. We called up Baxter and Chantal and then booked it to London in Kristine's dad's sweet car.&nbsp;<br />So yeah, we had talked to Waggles on MSN earlier all non-chalant and knew she would be home, so the 4 of us went over to London. So funny. Planning on how to surprise her...Baxter, ""we could phone her and at the same time call her and ring the bell"" what? ha ha...or we thought of just scaring the living daylights out of her ha ha...after running around with our hoods on, we went to the front door, rang the bell and then Waggles came...she was SO surprised!! ha ha I have never seen her mouth go that big before!! ha ha Anyway, we chilled for a bit. Did the Dairy Queen thing. Just good old chillin' with the girls time.&nbsp;<br />Drove back to Cambridge, without stopping the car the whole time...it is true...Kristine the pro driver ha ha...it was mostly just busy there were like no cars on the road...</p>
<p>Anyway, Tuesday I got up early to make sure I heard the buzzer when Krystal came. So yeah, got up and made some breakfast in case anyone wanted some. Pancakes, Sausages, Eggs, and Coffee :) Krystal came and the three of us chilled for a bit which was good stuff. These two days of chilling with my Heritage buddies definitely will tide me over for another couple weeks and then before you know it, it will be training week :)<br />So yeah, we chilled, went to the mall which was funny. In every store you go to, you really just have to find something to laugh at. It's like mall rules. So in Zellers we discovered some very nice sleepwear options to scare your new roommate or in Green Earth there were hanging beads that were put there to run under and hit your head on...or so I thought. Then we came back and played Apples to Apples. Hard to explain, but a fun game. Mostly just a laugh at stupid stuff game. So, my favourite :) Then Krystal had to leave, which was too bad. It was so good to just chill with 3/4 of the Fab Four :) If only Chasity wasn't in Dominican...<br />Anyway, Kristine had to leave shortly after, but we managed to fit in some sweet sweet swimming at Grandma's. What a beautiful day it was. Had a boat party...well, an under the boat but above the water party :) ha ha And we played colours and I discovered how bad I am at concentrating on both calling out colours and listening for splashing! ha ha<br />Anyway, so that was wonderful.<br /><br />I worked a bit this week, but not too much. Had some interesting experiences though of course. I met a lady named Ragwinder at work. Yep. No spelling mistakes. RAGWINDER. Crazy stuff. Not sure what else to say about that one. Oh, and this wasn't this week but I don't think I ever remembered to say it...but a couple of weeks ago, this guy comes to my till, buys some stuff and then a few minutes later comes back and is like, ""Katie...your name is Katie? hmmm...in some countries that means death."" and then walks away...WHAT?? Katie does not mean death!! It means PURE!! ha ha what a wacko...way to scare the living daylights out of me creepy old man!<br />Oh man, and tonight...it was really slow...except for like this one period of a half an hour or so...and of course, just when it got busy, everything fell apart! ha ha. I was in the middle of ringing someone threw. I had one other person in line...and it seemed that at this point in the store, no one was there with less than 20 items. I look to the person across from me (not beside me, but like one till down) and she is like, ""I think I am going to faint, can you finish up this order?"", turns her light off (which means -&nbsp;don't come to this till) and walks away...<br />Woah.<br />So I finish the lady I was dealing with, and then run over to hers and finish that order. Meanwhile, at MY till, there is a lady loading up a full cart. Oh no. So I finish at HER till and run back over to mine. Oh man. I figure no one else will go to her till because the light is out. Nope. As I am ringing through the lady at MY till, I see someone loading up at the other girl's till. Oh crap. It is one of the lady's that is always grumpy. Oh crap. I didn't see her in time and sure enough, she has loaded everything on the other girl's till. Oh no. So I am in the middle of the order at MY till, excuse myself for a second and run to the other till. Oh no. The computer at HER till wasn't touched for too long and now her password must be inputed for anyone to continue. Great. So now I can't even ring through grumpy lady even if I wanted! Oh crap. So I phone the office and inform them this girl has gone and possibly fainted somewhere?! And they are like, well, tell the people to go to MY till. What? Oh man. So, I get up some courage to tell the grumpy lady.<br />""Ma'am? I am really sorry, but this cashier had to leave because she felt really sick. I am sorry that you didn't see that her light was out and that I didn't catch you in time.""<br />""WHAT? Are you serious?"" (I seem to get the 'are you serious?' phrase a lot!)<br />""Yes, I am really sorry ma'am.""<br />""You could have told me before I put all my groceries down!!""<br />""I am really sorry.""<br />I don't have any more time to spare on apologies/telling the grumpy lady she should have seen that the light was out!! I run back over to my till and continue ringing in my customer (and of course the store is crazy at this point and there are at least two or three just at my till).&nbsp;<br />The grumpy lady continues to talk angrily to herself, her daughter, anyone who will listen really...she even was telling other customers around her that I didn't tell her she had to move until she had stood there a long time and blah blah making me sound super bad, but yeah. What can you do, eh? It sucked because it was super busy and now we were down a cashier, but like, I love the grumpies...they make me laugh!! ha ha<br />Oh, and I got to go shopping this week...at Old Navy :) on someone else's dime!! Yeah yeah...I got a gift card this week from a buddy, so sweet deal! Hooked up with two sweet polo t-shirts...a Charlie Brown one :) not really, but I feel like him in it...red and blue striped and then a navy one with thin green, purple, white, etc. stripes. Very fun. Ooh, and sleep shorts. Yeah yeah Old Navy!<br /><br />Anyway...so this is turning into my longest...and I have written some long ones!!<br />But, we can't forget VBS! Yes, I LOVE VBS :) And it was VBS Fiesta!! Jesus is our Saviour (VIVA), Jesus is our Friend (VIVA), Jesus is our Helper (VIVA), Jesus is our Life (VIVA), Jesus is our Healer (VIVA)...ha ha...singing sweet songs!! Oh man, I could only help out Thursday and Friday, so on Thursday I came and just like same the songs and did the actions like I knew them right...but then, we were singing this one song with crazy actions, and then all of a sudden they switch to singing it in Spanish!?!! Oh man! I was SO lost...I had no idea it was coming so I was standing there trying to learn and sing Spanish plus do the hand motions! ha ha that was fun!<br />But yeah, there is something so amazing about VBS. I love it so much. Seeing like 400 kids, 100 volunteers and like 50 moms (we have a mom's program that runs at the same time so they can do stuff and relax while their kids are at VBS...completely evangelist, very cool) singing songs about Jesus and having a blast! Totally breath-taking (I find) if you just sit back for a second and watch/listen.&nbsp;<br />But yeah, since I was only there two days, I just filled in where they needed me. So Thursday I was with Yellow B...hey, ho, Yellow B, ho...that is my nice cheer :) So yeah, they were grades 1-3. Anyway, it is crazy how quickly kids warm up to people eh? I joined that morning and by story time I had this one girl on my lap, her twin sister (they were SO cute!!) on one side nice and tight and then on the other side this girl was sitting on a chair but leaning over so that she could put her head on my shoulder. How cute is that? Who knew I was so desirable??! ha ha ha And the story was 'Jesus is our Saviour', so we were talking about his death and resurrection...so they had transformed the room into a cave!! SO COOL. To get into the room, you had to crawl through this cave entry thing (not built for 20 year olds, but I held my own! ha ha) and it had like fake snakes and some pads that were wet and all this stuff...so cool! And then of course a separate entrance for the scared kids...but yeah, we were in this cave talking about how we get lost and scared and stuff...and so we heard a lot of nice stories...and then near the end all the stories start to sound the same...one kid will tell a story and then everyone else decides it is a cool story so they all decide to have that same experience too and tell us about when it happened to them ha ha. And then they were saying how they put a seal on the tomb to lock Jesus in...and this one boy (SO CUTE) was like, ""A seal like I see at the zoo??"" ha ha<br />But yeah, and then Friday I was with Aqua B...hey, ho, Aqua B, ho...and they were ages 4 and 5! So cute!! I secretly wished the first day that I had been put with the older kids, but I always love the young kids too...they are just too funny!! So anyway, we were talking about 'fishers of men' and how Jesus is our Friend (VIVA). The leader was asking what we do when we are scared (looking for...pray! ha ha) She gave the example of being scared during a thunderstorm.&nbsp;This one boy goes, ""Go inside your house!""<br />Well, what if you are still scared?<br />""Hide!""<br />And what if you are still scared?<br />""Run Away!""<br />And then this other boy, (both so cute!!) says, (and my apologies...this will only be truly funny if you are familiar with VeggieTales...though I am sure you can still find remote hilarity in the absurdity of his answer even if you are not VeggieTales savvy)<br />""Well, you could just sing...<br />God is bigger than the boogeyman! He's bigger than gorillas or the monsters on TV. Oh, God is bigger than the boogeyman and he's watching out for you and me!! ... watchinnnnng...watchinnnnng...watchinnnng...out for you...and...MEEEE!!!""<br />Just to get the full image, he was singing rather loud (quite boldly), with hand motions as per a jive and the end was a near spirit-fingers experience. And yes, he was 5.&nbsp;<br />It was SO funny. The leaders were dying, and of course we asked him to get up and teach everyone the song. ha ha what a kid.<br />We also had kids trying to bring worms in from outside. This group was also supposedly the worst 4 and 5's group with the most runners...and yep, it was great times. I loved it!!<br /><br />So yeah, there is my long overdue and very lengthy update.<br />Whew.<br />That made me tired.<br />Hope these sweet summer days are finding you in love with God and His beautiful creation! Don't you just love the heat?! I DO!! ha ha...and the way I figure, the heat makes us appreciate the cold, so it may as well be enjoyed...<br />Cheers.</p>"

Fill this out about your SENIOR year of high school! The longer ago it was, the more fun the answers will be.<br />Okay, so it hasn't been that long and I didn't really like high school, so we will see how this turns out...ha ha<br /><br /><br />1. Who was your best friend?<br />Um...Shelby?&nbsp; I wasn't really a ""best friends"" kind of girl growing up...I just hung out with everyone...<br /><br />2. What sports did you play?<br />None, sadly. I was shy and didn't really care to hang out with people, so, apart from Badminton in grade 9, I devoted my time to working at the library ha ha, youth group and getting good grades...<br /><br />3. What kind of car did you drive?<br />My parents' Echo...and yep, that's still what I drive...<br /><br />4. It's Friday night, where were you at?<br />Hmm...youth group...or at home...hmm...or at the Mills'...yeah, we were at Matt's a lot in grade 12...<br /><br />5. Were you a party animal?<br />Ha ha ha oh yeah...refer to question 2 if you don't catch the sarcasm...<br /><br />6. Were you considered a flirt?<br />HA HA no...this question should be - did I talk to boys? ha ha no, not really...I talked to a few in classes and stuff but thought they were all stupid and didn't spend much energy on them...talked a bunch in class, but not out of class...<br /><br />7. Ever skip school?<br />HA HA oh man, no...in fact, until grade 11, I refused to go on field trips so I wouldn't miss school!! ha ha Who knows, maybe that day there would be some really important information and I would miss it!! ha ha What a nerd.<br /><br />8. Ever smoke?<br />Oh man, this survey makes me laugh. No, no I did not.<br /><br />9. Were you a nerd?<br />HA...I think this is the first question I can say yes to...okay, I think you all get the picture...<br /><br />10. Did you get suspended/expelled?<br />Ha ha no...have I ever got a detention? No, definitely not...so...yeah.<br /><br />11. Can you sing the Alma Mater?<br />Didn't have one.<br /><br />12. Who was your favorite teacher?<br />Mr. Harley...history, sociology, etc. teacher. He was awesome! Just really passionate about teaching and caring and very fun. He would randomly throw candy at us (his wife worked at some candy factory). And then he would run across the hall to the other history class and all you would hear is another funny teacher (Mrs. Derman) yell, ""Oh no, here he comes"" and then he would throw candy at them too ha ha...<br /><br />13. Favorite class<br />German :), History...and our math class was actually pretty fun...Data Management so it was lots of projects and stuff. Our teacher, Mrs. Talbot was really, really great too and we had a lot of fun people in that class. It was one class that I actually talked to people...quite a bit actually :)<br /><br />14. What was your school's full name?<br />Glenview Park Secondary School<br /><br />15. School mascot?<br />Panther<br /><br />16. If you could go back and do it over, would you?<br />Yes. Only because I wish I had done more, been more outgoing and such. Not because I think I will like it any more, but I wish I had been a lot more comfortable, I guess...<br /><br />18. Were you ever posted on the Senior Wall?<br />What? I don't even know what this is...<br /><br />19. Did you have a job your senior year?<br />Yeah yeah...Cambridge Public Libraries and Galleries baby...CPL all the way :)<br /><br />20. Who did you date?<br />Ha ha no one...high school boys are completely stupid...<br /><br />21. Where did you go most often for lunch?<br />Ha ha...um, ha ha...well, probably two-thirds cafeteria, one-third library...ha ha<br /><br />22. What did you do after graduation?<br />Heritage :)<br /><br />23. Did you lose your virginity your senior year?<br />No.<br /><br />24. Who was your prom king/queen?<br />I actually have no idea. For real. I didn't even go to prom, so that might have something to do with the not knowing, eh?<br /><br />25. Did you win anything in your year book?<br />Nope, sure didn't...I think they actually stopped doing it for a bit (not that I would have won ha ha) because this girl in the grade above me got voted biggest flirt (and she TOTALLY deserved it ha ha) and made this huge stink about it and they weren't allowed to put it in the yearbook!<br /><br />26. Do you still have your yearbook?<br />Of course, all of them. Fun to look at them, but they are definitely not many pictures of me in there!</div>

"event","Well alright. 
Here I am, back again. 
Sometimes, I almost find that I hate having a lot of great stories to tell, simply because I know that after a weekend of busy fun, I am going to have to sit down and type them all up. But that really only ever last a few seconds because I mean, come on, when do I ever not LOVE telling my stories? ha ha even if it is just to myself :) 
Why such the long blog you ask? 
Well, my dear friends, these past days marked the Katie-Kristine after-weekend weekend (and Friends). Yep, it finally happened!! I can't even tell you how great it was to see Kristine, to hang out with her and my buddies, to laugh and laugh and laugh some more and just have fun and catch up.&nbsp; 
Before we get right down to the goofiness, a serious moment. (Yes, I know it is weird, but I can be serious! ha ha) This blog is about friends, really. I have been thinking a lot about friendships, relationships in general, actually lately, and definitely this all spawned from entering college. First year, nearing the end, was my moment of great epiphany when I finally clued in (don't know why this didn't happen sooner, but hey, at least I finally learned it!) to the fact that everyone is in our life for a reason. That is, of course, if you believe in this whole God and fate, etc, business, which I do :) I can't remember what exactly happened that day, but it changed me. I mean, think about it...you affect people. How you react affects people. The words you say, affect people. Your actions&nbsp;affect people. Your generosity, or lack thereof, affects people. Your passion, your positivism, (or negativism) your ability to keep secrets, to listen, to encourage...YOU AFFECT PEOPLE. Scary as it is, it isn't something that, in my opinion, can be disregarded even for a second. Are not most of us surrounded by people for at least 10 hours in a day? Not to scare you furthur, but think of what happens in a day...how many original thoughts break into your mind in a single day? How many words come from your mouth in just a single day? Stop for a second...it's crazy. 
So I started to learn that really in first year. But the most amazing thing was that I could look back to journals at the beginning of the year and in the middle, and reading them months after I could see myself learning that lesson...I just didn't know it yet! I found that so amazing. 
Anyway, second year simply furthered my interest in relationships and in people. I think a lot of what my relationships are is partly due to my imagination, partly due to my curiousity, and partly due to my intense need to understand. Clarification? Sure. I have a great curiousity in knowing how people think. Not WHAT (and don't count me out as heartless, I will come back to this), but HOW. How does their mind work? How does someone go from talking about fruit to discussing their worries about their future (this is quite simple a made up scenario I created about two seconds prior to typing it)? How do people process circumstances in life? How does your reaction relate to my reaction to say, being woken up before you were ready and why is that? 
Anyway, that is my curiosity speaking. Don't worry, I also care deeply about the whats. What are you feeling? What do you think? What do you wish? All these and all the rest are important. I simply find a great interest in trying to discover the hows to the whats. 
So what am I saying? 
I guess this year has been a great realization in how I communicate, or&nbsp;how I am perceived. This does not mean I hold great value in what people think of me on superficial matters such as dress or appearance - however, I am greatly intrigued as to how my actions and words come across; does what I say and do speak what I wish it to? 
It has been along this path that I have come to a fork in the road. For years and years, in discovering the girl God made me to be, I have many times confronted the facts about my many character traits and flaws. For years and years I have been intentional about discovering who I was, trying to bring that in line with God's will and purpose for me, and, ultimately, purify those flaws and strengthen those character traits. In the past year, I have discovered that I have not been very successful, or I am at least not at the point where I would like to be. Maybe it is the perfectionist coming through, but no matter, I will continue - Jesus was perfect...No, I do not think that I will ever reach perfection, but, in a healthy realization of that, I see no point in trying to become as much like Jesus as I possible can through His amazing grace, love, forgiveness and correction. 
I don't really feel like I have anything to hide, so I will continue. Through a lot of amazing relationships and through this constant look at my integrity and inner self (ineself for short? ha ha) I discover a sarcastic spirit that I hope to dim a little duller and a compassion that I hope to turn a little brighter. I see the sense of being carefree that I wish to extend to outside my comfortable walls, and a pride that always needs to backseat-it a little more often. I see the thoughts of generosity that need to burn a hole in all my pockets (not just my favourite pair) and positivity that all to often tries to fit in with the bummed out crowd. I see imperfection. 
It has been an amazing ride. A roller coaster of relationships when I am side-tracked taking soul shots at the same time. I have been so incredibly blessed, even just in considering these past two years. I know I have talked about it before, but I bring to mind again my thoughts to my funeral. I like to think, what if everyone I have ever known was asked to say something at my funeral? Not a five-minute speech, just something. What would it be? What will I leave? What will I have given?&nbsp; 
I know that you will never be friends with everyone. I know that life takes its course and some people simply don't remain 'friends forever'. And I know that this is not something to fear or cry yourself to sleep at night about - as life takes its course, some people are simply friends for convenience sake, others will be friends that grow old together. However, with all this said, I am so very grateful to every person that has been put in my path (and especially those who put up with me!). I am an extremely blessed person and am reminded daily of that fact. I could never have imagined or hoped for the friends that I have been given. They are truly a gift from God, and I have been so blessed to take this journey of discovering why God placed you in my life. With my simple mind, most of life remains a mystery, but one thing that I can say for certain is that one of God's most amazing gifts to humankind are relationships. Modeled after the most intimate relationship of all (one I hope and pray that you all may experience and find complete and utter joy in), that of each individual and God our Creator, may I, and may we seek to always grow in our relationships here on Earth. 

So, that was pretty much my longest ramble EVER. ha ha. And now I am so tired that I cannot continue with my great stories. I mean...seriously, that took a long time! ha ha But, don't you&nbsp;fret, I will return, and that return will bring with it stories of the weekend that trumped all others! (or at least a lot of others...and especially&nbsp;the boring weekends so far this summer!!) 
Thanks for reading all my nonsensical talk :)"

"event","I was doing laps in my Grandma's pool yesterday. I like doing laps. First ten with just your arms, second ten with just your legs, some breast-stroke, some side-stroke, some backwards...it is nice. I finished those and was still waiting there for mom and Curt, as they were coming after Curt finished work. Seeing as it wasn't such a nice day outside, and therefore tanning was out of the question, I headed indoors and perused the infamous home video collection for one of my liking. I love home videos.
The one I watched was from 1999 and 2000. Man, we were all funny looking! ha ha It was great - seeing my 13 and 14 year old self, and tiny little Curtis! And my Grandpa, oh boy, he was a funny man. Had a little footage of my grandparents out west, in BC, visiting their son and daughter-in-law. They went for a mountain hike and my Grandpa would tape the scenery and such. He did a nice demonstration of their walk - there was a big map of the park so, on camera, he got someone to point out where they started, where they ate lunch, etc. and then there was a sign beside the map about bears (which you could clearly see on the video), but, for dramatic effect I'm sure, he said, ""will someone please read that sign for me"". And then, someone along the video he made sure to mention that he was not in the video, because he was taping it...just in case we all thought his voice was appearing from the sky or something...what a guy.
And then of course we had to watch my grade 8 graduation. Now that, my friends, is good stuff. My little duet with Trish! ha ha or my lovely speech. Good times.
Tonight, we are up for some good old-fashioned Heritage fun. Jake's birthday was yesterday so he got people together for tonight and we shall be doing something lovely I am sure. Not too many people, and frankly I don't really know who, but it should be good.
And then...Kristine and I might finally have our ""after-weekend weekend"" together, with the very lovely Krystal visiting on the Tuesday of our Monday-Tuesday visit. I have actually been telling myself that it isn't going to happen (a nice psychological trick ha ha) just in case it doesn't, and then I will be less disappointed ha ha. You know how on Finding Nemo, when Dory finally remembers the address...""P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney...you want me to say it again, because I will...P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney...I can say it again if you want, you want me to say it again..."" and gets keeps repeating it even though no one is listening? That is kind of like me ha ha. Whenever I started to think about it I would just be like, ""Yeah, it is too bad Kristine can't come. We thought she could but she can't. What a shame that she can't come..."" But, it looks pretty good...only three days away and no problems yet...
To end, because my very limited creative juices seem not to flow this morning...a little poemy thing my Grandma wrote in one of my cards...

I walk by faith and not by sight,
Why seek along the way for light,
Beyond today.
The Savior holds my feeble hand,
And so I follow His command,
He is my stay.
I need not look beyond to see,
I need not know His way for me,
Beyond this hour.
For by His grace His will I'll do,
His gracious Spirit leads me through,
And gives me power.
-Eva Gray"

"event","So, it was Canada Day on Saturday.
That means fireworks, patriotism, and only one grocery store open in the city.
Us.
What a smart choice we made...
Turns out maybe we should have just rested like everyone us. Apparently, when the manager got there at like 8:30 (we were open 9:00-6:00), there were about 40 people waiting outside the store! One of the people waiting even had the gall to tell the manager that ""maybe you should open up early, we have been waiting for awhile"". Yeah, the manager wasn't impressed.
I was supposed to work 2:30-6:30, but called in early. They called at 10:50, ten minutes after I had woken up, and asked if I could come in ""as soon as possible"". Well okay. No showering. No eating. Just running to Food Basics.
When I got there, we were completely out of sugar, dill, hot dog buns, hamburger buns, water softener salt...and this was at 11:30am, just two and a half hours after opening. It was absolute insanity the whole 7 hours I was there!! Absolute insanity. I didn't have time to relax for even a second. I took over for this guy on Express, the store quite hot and crowded and Express with a line-up of at least 10 people, and here I am, SO TIRED already. Oh man. Then, one of my first customers, a 40 year old man, gets rung through and is putting his groceries away. Then I hear, ""Um, excuse me? You might want to call someone for clean-up...I dropped my magarine."" I look back...a cracked container on the floor and two huge blobs of greasy, slippery, digusting magarine all over the floor right beside where everyone puts their groceries away. The guy didn't even care. We were busy and it couldn't be cleaned up immediately, so I kept having to be like: ring in one item, turn around, warn customers of magarine, call again for clean-up, ring in an item, warn someone else, call again...it was lovely. 
Let's just say that the stories are too many to name. I probably saw about a million hot dogs and hamburgers...but no buns, ha ha. Thousands of watermelons, cases of water...it was ridiculous. By the end of the night, all the cashiers were about ready to die. But even at 6:00, when we closed, there were still tons of people in the store. 
And then...
SHE came. The woman without a name. The woman will an evil smirk. The woman that tried my VERY last bits of patience. 
It was 6:00. This woman comes to my till with a very full cart of groceries. Behind her in line, just to my till, were 8 other people, all with very full carts as well. Oh yay.
I start ringing her groceries in, and then she starts...
""So what, you don't have any boxes?!""
""I am sorry ma'am, no, we don't have too many. There are a few in there, but not too many. We were very busy today.""
""So because you don't have boxes...it looks like I have two options: buy your bags or throw my groceries in my cart?!! Because that is just not right, that is not fair! Just because you run out of boxes shouldn't mean that I have to buy your bags...this is just not right...(she continues to mutter and then get loud and say it again, mutter and stammer and argue)""
""I am very sorry ma'am, but we were busy today, so most of our boxes are gone. We rely on suppliers for boxes as well, we don't get have an endless supply.""
""So I have two options: buy your bags or throw my groceries in my cart?""
""Yes, I guess you do ma'am. I am sorry, I am not sure what else to say.""
""Where is a manager?""
Luckily, Jen, one of my managers was walking by. Without informing her of the situation, I call her over with a very nice, ""Hey Jen?""
Jen comes over and asks what the problem is...I don't say a word and just wait for this lady to talk. The lady doesn't talk for like 30 seconds, but just stares her down in complete hatred of our store. She finally starts...
""Because you have no boxes, I have to buy bags, is this what you are trying to tell me?!""
Jen, a little confused says, ""Yes."" And then proceeds to say she will go find Matt, one of the head grocery clerks, to inquire about boxes. Soon enough, Matt comes over - he wasn't informed of the problem either! ha ha He comes over and is like, ""Hey Katie, what's up?""
The lady gives him the two-option bit again. Matt, someone who refuses to take crap from idiots say, ""Yes. You have to buy bags."" and walks away, over to the back where the boxes should be.
I continue ringing in the groceries because I don't know what else to do. The lady is just fuming, but not saying much. I finish her groceries and in my daring spirit ask, ""Do...you...need...any...bags??""
""NO! I am not buying your bags!! What a rip-off! This is completely unfair, I can't believe you would expect me to buy bags when you are supposed to have boxes!!""
I don't replied but just say, ""Um, so your total is $105.25""
(consider that number for a minute and realize just how many groceries she had...58 items to be precise!)
She doesn't respond. She is now placing a few items in her cart. I give it a minute and then repeat myself, 
""Um...your total is $105.25??""
""Okay.""
She continues packing. The 8 customers behind her are now getting more and more frustrated. I give it another minute then go with a very polite, 
""Ma'am?""
""I am coming, give me a sec.""
She continues to pack ALL her groceries, and REFUSES to come pay for them until she has packed them all in her cart (without bags of course)...which means I can't start on anyone else's either. Even as people behind her are telling her to hurry up, she gets packs away. She finally pays, of course giving me her money as slowly as possible.
Anyway, let's just say I had fun. When I said ""Ma'am"" and she still wouldn't acknowledge me, I lost it...in laughter, especially since I was looking at Matt and he was busting up at her stupidity. So there you go. We finally got everyone out of there and were cleaning up. I told the other managaer that I had forgotten what silence sounded like! And mentioned that you could actually hear the music now...and guess what song was randomly playing?? ""You Had a Bad Day""!! ha ha I laughed so hard and asked if someone had requested it...oh man. Oh Canada! Oh, and a cop came by and we got fined 5,000 because we weren't supposed to be open on Canada Day! ha ha. 
After that, my mom, dad and grandma came to go to my Nana's (great-grandma's) because her 92nd birthday is today (the 3rd), but first they got me a sandwich at McD's since I had only had two apples and two diet pops so far that day...The sandwich took 12 minutes ha ha. Oh man, so glad I don't work there.
But Nana's was fun. She is hilarious. Telling us that she is returning these earrings her daughter-in-law gave her (for Christmas) when she comes for a visit because according to my Nana - they aren't pretty and I will never wear them, so I am giving them back! ha ha Bossing my dad around getting him to fix stuff. Then she was showing us this bird she has that chirps when there is motion around it. She was trying to show us how it worked, so she look the paper, looked at the bird and said, ""Hear, read this!"" and waved it around to the bird. She is so funny. Asking what will happen to her clothes when she dies because ""she can't last much longer!"" and telling us that she is the best dressed and best fed girl at cards! Also telling us how she likes to get an Irish coffee sometimes but she has to be careful with her bad ankle and knee ha ha. She also interpreted a story of my Grandma's to tell her that her (my Grandma's) toenails were getting pretty long. She then described how she likes to cut her toenails on her toilet so she can rest her foot on the seat (she is meanwhile demonstrating the technique). After explaining, she adds in of course, ""oh, and I am naked when I do this."" Thank you Nana. Oh, and we got a nice view when she was telling us how her pants her getting a little worn...in the crotch area. ha ha. I love her, so funny. She does what makes her happy. She says whatever she wants.
Sunday I worked. And then I worked this morning 9-1. Now I am exhausted! Had a pool party at Grandma's. The whole family there plus my brother's girlfriend-Loran, her sister Kristin, my friend Kristen, and then Kala, Chelsey and Lilly. Party time. Then after I hung out with Tim, Loran and Kristin. Break it down! ha ha. Tried pretzels with onion dip...not bad. Kristin made me try...she said, ""stick this in your hole"" and gave it to me ha ha, so I tried it!
Alright, I am exhausted. Thankfully, I have tomorrow off minus a meeting with Mark. Ooh, and STUCA shirts maybe coming in this week. OH, and 9 weeks since school got out, and 8 weeks today till training week - on the home stretch now!! ha ha
AND, Kristine might be coming next Monday and Tuesday! :) I am a firm believer that my boss doesn't give me my hours, God does. I submitted a note on Sunday asking to have early morning shifts on Monday and Tuesday (next week) if possible, if I was working. This would provide optimal visting time with Kristine, but also I wouldn't have to take time off (especially could if she couldn't end up coming). I figured it could be too late because my boss is going on vacation and so she made the schedules early.
One of the managers talked to me today...my boss had already made the schedule, but put me down for Monday 9-1pm and Tuesday -off-...before she saw the note. God is great, so very great. So, if she does end up being able to come, I have the perfect hours!! Woohoo.
Alright, BED. YAY."

"event","Things have been good lately. I have been missing my grandpa (mom's dad) a lot lately. Mostly I guess because it would have been his birthday (65th) on June 21st and it is the anniversary of his death July 2nd (he died in 2000 at the age of 59 from Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma - just after I finished grade 8). So yeah, you would think after 6 years it wouldn't be as bad, but you know, I am just a sentimental :) 
But seriously, I hardly ever cried until he died. And then you know, every movie where someone dies or is in the hospital or whatever, you can just relate so, there you go...I cry ha ha. It is funny, I love it. But yeah, God works in very strange ways. I had been missing him quite a bit and then yesterday I was working and two ladies came to my till. In asking if I could keep the refrigerator stuff aside, they mentioned that they were on their break from work. I noticed (as I am always checking things out :) ha ha) that they were from the Waterloo Regional Police - where my grandpa worked for about 35 years (my uncle Jason, his son, works there now). I checked again to make sure and then said, ""You work at the Waterloo Regional Police station?""
The one woman said, ""Yeah we do.""
I said, ""Oh, my uncle works there.""
They asked who my uncle was, to which I replied, ""Jason Bonikowsky.""
The same woman replied, ""Oh, I know Jason. But I knew his father better.""
I said, ""Yeah, my grandpa.""
The woman continued, ""He was a great friend. A really good guy. He is really missed.""
They both said similar things they whole time, about how great he was and how missed he is. 
(At this point I was tearing up nicely at my till -and now ha ha- but managed to stay composed to avoid a very embarassing situation!!)
In chatting, the one woman said she was actually one of the people who helped organize his retirement party.
So yeah. It was just super encouraging to hear that. I mean, as his family, of course we miss him a lot - it is just nice to know that others miss him too. Isn't it just always encouraging to hear great things about your family? I mean, in my mind, Robert Bonikowsky may just be a name to many people, but to me, he's a legacy :) Seriously, his faith, his trust in God was simply incredible. His testimony at work, his life as a husband, father and grandfather...anyway, he was incredible and I hope to live even half the life that he did.
So you can laugh at little Katie :) and see my Grandpa, here are some fun pictures ha ha...
I was in grade seven in the first one ha ha- I did my grade seven science project on film development and my grandpa brought me to the police station to develop film the old fashioned way (he worked in the forensic department for his last like 20 years). This doesn't look like one of his best days (he is pale - was always pretty tanned and was always real healthy and athletic). After the project stuff was finished, he let me wear his bullet-proof vest and belt and hold the expandable baton and then I got my fingerprints taken :)
The second one is me and him at a cottage when I was in grade 5 I am pretty sure. So, 10 years old...One year at the cottage, during the chemo years and everything, he and my uncle would go on the jetski and then the one sitting on the back (they both did it) would do a backflip off the jetski...ha ha.
Anyway, Wonderland was awesome of course. Spent the first half of the day (we were there from 10:30am to 10:00pm!!) with these three girls...all about grade 10 age (well, just finished grade 10) and two of them were girls that worked for me last year. So that was fun, they are great. Got on lots of rides. And it was rainy, but on and off...and more off than on. We had a few temporarily delays, but it was mostly great. A lot of our waits for rides were like 20-30 minutes which was great. Bryan had said the leaders were meeting for supper at 4-5, so I left my group at 4 to meet them. I had thought that they probably wouldn't show - all the leaders except me ended up in one group (all the kids took off and the girls told me to come with them so I did, and then just the leaders were left so they went together) so I figured they might end up eating later.
Anyway, I waited for them a bit, got kind of frustrated and left. Got a funnel cake :), sat and ate it. Then of course I started thinking about the fact that last time I was here, it was with the youth group and Brad and was getting all stupid and pity party like...poor me I am sitting here by myself sorta deal. And even though I was trying to be happy, it wasn't working. It was then I knew I needed to pray :) So I prayed for a bit, watching the waterfall I love. I ended up being at the meeting spot at 5 (the ending of the time when the leaders were supposed to meet) and two girls were there. They had heard the time and came by because they weren't sure if they had to but better safe than sorry (cautious grade niners :) gotta love them...it was like looking in a mirror ha ha ha) and then they asked about when to be back. I thanked God I could be there for them and was more smiley already.
Then I went off to go on some rides and prayed that God would let me find kids to hang out with or he would give me contentedness in some alone time. I went on two rides and then stumbled into Curt and three of his friends. I could have gone with them, but by then I was finally happy :) and get walking. Went on two more and then instead of going on another ride went walking back by the bridge to hit up the other side of the park (definitely convinced God led me away from going on the ride). When I was walking by the bridge, I was like, hmm...I will just eat pizza, I feel like pizza and almost the whole pity party thing again. I decided (God prompting?) not to waste the money and kept walking. Then, I heard my name and it was all the leaders eating supper (now about 6:30), and Bryan's like - hey, I was supposed to buy you dinner - want some pizza?! ha ha. I like God's sense of humour :) So then I ate with them and headed out with them to finish the night. No more than five minutes of walking and we came upon the three girls I had been with that morning. God is a miracle man. ha ha. I had to laugh at my foolishness. And of course the rest of the night was wonderful. Part of me is still like, and will probably be like for a long awhile - that it just isn't the same without Brad and that is saddening (especially since I don't like change :) ha ha), but we had an amazing core of leaders (including like 4 great, and young couples) who have been involved for awhile and are really pumped to change up the youth group and make it great. So yeah, exciting stuff.
Other than that...just living life :) Trying to be a healthy girl! ha ha. Not a diet. I hate diets. I think they are the stupidest, most ineffective things on the planet. I seriously don't think diets are ever necessary. I truly think that the only thing you can stick with happily is - Eat in moderation in combination with avoiding junk and exercising. There you go - the Katie Philosophy :) Anyway, just walking a lot, playing some tennis and some frisbee, and doing the old push-up/sit-up thing. I also quite enjoy making my own food, so that is good. Made my own hamburgers tonight :) Very good! I actually made two kinds, but have only tried one. So yeah, I made one of them with a delicable spinach salad avec strawberries, almonds and a creamy poppyseed dressing! ha ha. Qu'est-ce que c'est delicious!! Hopefully I don't have to get drug tested anytime soon...blasted poppyseeds ha ha...oh Seinfeld - what a classic Tv program. But in all seriousness, I am fine with the way I look...like, fine. ha ha. I just want to be healthy. I figure walking can't hurt, so why not? ha ha.
Yeah, that is about it I think. Life is grand :)
I watched Waterworld tonight. What a pointless movie. Sometimes I was like, oh no, maybe I like it...but mostly I just thought I was wasting my time. And the ending sucked butt. Still undecided as to my final verdict though. Definitely a weird one though.
I also just painted my fingers AND toes. What is getting into me?!
It is officially Canada Day though! Working tomorrow for a couple hours in the afternoon - time and a half!! And then heading with mom, dad and grandma to my Nana's (great-grandma's) because she is turning 92 (!!) on July 3rd. Not doing so hot, but she is sure stubborn. So we will see if she is depressed or not when we get there...
The very last-minute and never really a plan ""Kristine at Wonderland plan"" fell through, but maybe July 10th and 11th? We shall see. By the way, 57 days until training week :) Meet with Mark on Tuesday to talk about it and the student body retreat. Woohoo.
Off to bed.
Let the good times roll Canada.
We are so incredibly blessed to live here.

And, the day has upmost possibilities for greatness - Kristine lives really close to Wonderland (and has a season's pass) so, if she can get the car (which isn't always easy of course) she might can visit me at Wonderland tomorrow night. So there you go. But either way, I am excited for a rockin' day tomorrow. Just hold off the rain, okay? I don't mind a little rain, in fact, that is better because not as many people are there. But you know, thunderstorms shut down the rides so...
Erin and Sarah visited Saturday which was pleasant of course. After they left I watched Signs (and cried ha ha) and Glass House (cried again ha ha oh man I'm a wreck :) ha) and then Kala came home and we went on a ""wireless internet escapade"" because we didn't have internet all weekend and she needed to talk to someone.
Working a fair bit lately which has been great. Got called in yesterday for a 5.5 hour shift, so that is like 30 hours this week, and 4 of those are at time and a half. Woohoo. My boss is coming through for me!
Work was crazy this weekend though! So many crazy sales on Saturday so, seriously, the 5.5 hours just flew...in a very tiring way. And then Sunday, we were out of like three of the major sale items! This is major trouble. Plus we were completely out of the plastic bags for fruit and vegetables for some reason, so it was just bad. My favourite customer this weekend, oh man...bought the wrong kind of ice cream (the one not on sale) and didn't realize it until after she paid. A few minutes after she paid, she came back to my till (oh no I thought).
""I want ice cream for $2.00!!!,"" (shows me the receipt), ""You charged me $2.77!!""
""Yes ma'am, that is because you bought Equality ice cream. It is the Breyers that is on sale.""
""Well, I want ice cream for $2.00!!""
""Okay, you can have it for that price. If you would like a refund, you will need to go to Till #4 and she can do it for you there,"" (hands me the ice cream), ""Ma'am, you might want to take the ice cream with you so they know you bought it.""
""I'M NOT TAKING THAT WITH ME!!""
Then she left, without the ice cream. I was stunned. And sure enough, the manager doing the refund came to get the ice cream a few minutes later.
Oh grumpy people, they make me laugh.
Other than that...not too much going on.
Doing the work thing today 3:30-9:00 then to my parents' to sleep because I have to be at the church at 8:15am for Wonderland!! Yay. Then there all day. Home sometime around midnight. Sleeping at parents' again. Grandma driving me to work for 9:00-2:30. Then back to parents' again so I can play volleyball at church Thursday night. Then back to dorm Thursday night after volleyball so I can sleep because I work Friday 10:00-3:30. So there you go. Somewhat busy I guess, but all good busy.
Yep, now I am off to work...the beginning of it all..."

"event","I love So You Think You Can Dance...so much. It is wonderful.
In other news, my brother's latest reality tv show idea is ""So You Think Your Sister's A Nerd""...I think I have already been voted first winner.
Bought a new bathing suit today. Yay.
Swam again, of course.
Ordered STUCA t-shirts. Wow. I've got the power...that could be bad ha ha.
Worked a bit tonight. Had some language troubles. Oh man. One of my first customers had a thicker accent - European maybe. She was asking me about 'cash back' as soon as she saw me. I knew I didn't have much money in my till as I just started and told her that I likely only had 60 in bills. She was insistent and asked if I could phone anyone about it. I can and did and got someone to lend me 100 because she wanted 150 back. She kept talking - something about 10s, 20s and other stuff like that but I was having a difficult time understand, and the questions I was asking weren't getting me any farther. I rang in her groceries, added 150 to the bill and she paid. I go to give her the 150 - all twenties and a ten of course...and she goes, ""You aren't giving it to me like that, are you?"" I was like, ""Pardon?""
Then she goes on this huge rant about how she CLEARLY specified that she wanted it in one bill...
""One bill?""
""Yes - one 100 dollar bill and a 50""
""I'm sorry ma'am, I didn't know that.""
""And there is no way to get it? I assume you don't have any. Probably no one does.""
""Well ma'am, one of the cashiers might have those bills, but I am not sure who would.""
""Well, isn't this great. I guess I have to take it now don't I. I certainly don't want to. I am sending money by mail and I certainly don't want to send it like this...""
She went on for a bit - very angrily actually, but then finally stormed off.
Man. I never knew I needed to go to language school to be a cashier.
Then, nearing the end of the night - this lady came through, again with a thicker accent, and again possibly European. She had a bunch of groceries and a bottle of 20 water on the bottom. Now, you see, we just got these 20s of water in and so I didn't have the code at my till. She told me she had the water to which I replied, ""Yes, and I am sorry ma'am, but I need to scan it.""
""Yes, it's the 20.""
""Yes, and I think I need to scan it, ma'am.""
""Okay.""
Nothing.
No handing of the water to Katie.
""I'm going to have to scan it?""
(Can she hear me?)
Nothing.
Definitely no handing of the water to Katie.
So I ring all her groceries through.
Maybe she is waiting?
Nope, definitely not waiting. Still no passing of water to Katie and no attempts to tell me the code.
So I ring in all of her groceries, go out of my till, walk over to her cart, bend down, grab the water, flip it over and memorize the 10 digit code so I can punch it in.
""It's the Nestea...the 20.""
""Yes, thank you.""
""So it's okay?""
""Yes.""
""It's the right one?""
""Yes.""
(You idiot, what are you even saying to me?)
So there you go. Apparently my communicating skills are not perfect...ha ha.
I think I am also being taught some patience and compassion through this job. Needed lessons...but the whole language thing? Not as fun ha ha.
I am all for languages, but sometimes I get a little irritated I can't understand them. And of course anytime someone speaks in a different language around my till I automatically assume they are laughing at me ha ha.
Oh, and sometimes it's like they are taunting you! The other day I had this girl and mom come through...they would taught to me just a little, but would then carry on this conversation in another language - something European, I think. BUT the girl would ask her questions in English and THEN switch, but the mom never really spoke English. It was the weirdest thing! And I mean, come on - then I was just dying to know what they were talking about!! ha ha
""So what do you think I should do? Hoia akkj akjdk alkjlka akjkllk aauugh...""
""ajkd ajj j lkjaja;f jlaj""
""I don't even want to go. akj; kajl;kj kjlkj kja""
""ak ajk akj ajjk jlajklj""
It was weird!
I am however, developing a fascination with the number of ways people ask to use the debit machine.
Debit please.
I will use the card.
Card.
Machine please.
I will swipe it.
I'll be swiping.
I was wondering if I could use my debit card.
Pointing to machine.
Waiting by machine.
It's debit.
Anyway - I have found it quite the art. Maybe I should develop a personality assessment completely based on the way people shop. That would be interesting...
Oh man - last one, I promise. Three guys about my age came in just after 9:00. They set down two packages of Mentos and four bottles of Diet Coke on my till. I took one look at their mischevious faces and said, ""You making explosions?""
They just stood there, quite shocked, and laughed. The one guy was like, ""Woah. How did she know?"" and then I believe added, ""Yeah, we don't really have lives.""
I was like, ""It's okay - I just did it like last week.""
They were like, ""What? Are you serious...small world.""
Then they started asking me about my technique ha ha and told me their were going to try and build a rocket. So there you go. Nice conversation starter."

"event","So last night after the parents and Curto went to bed...I relax and watch a little CSI and then realized that ""Message in a Bottle"" was on tv. Yay. I had started watching it once but we had to go somewhere I couldn't finish (I had only watched like a half hour of it the first time). So I am sitting there, remembering that my mom had mentioned it was pretty sad...but oh well...I am watching, getting teary in parts but it was all good. 
Then, it starts to get sadder, and it is at about that point that I remember that it would have been Grandpa's birthday today, and I get really sad. Longest day of the year - most time to open presents he always said :)
So I am sad and crying a little on and off...
AND THEN
The movie ends, in the saddest way any movie has ever even thought about ending!!
Yep, saddest movie ever.
I finally come up at like 2:00am and my eyes are so red they look like blood (sorry for the creepy visual). So yep, if you want to cry...""Message in a Bottle"" it is..."

"event","I don't know what is wrong with me. I think I am in some sort of a summer funk. I am happy, that's not the thing. God and I are tight - reading Proverbs and Esther and really being forced to think a lot. It's just that Satan guy. I can definitely feel some warfare, and it's not fun. Like pushing me to change my attitude about my more solitary state from, ""This summer of quiet is a great opportunity to lean to go to God first and really get to know Him"" to ""I am so lonely"". Pushing me to change my attitude about my job from ""I really like it, actually"" to ""My job doesn't fulfill that deep down desire for me to do something with my life"". It is frustrating, because I am happy. I can appreciate the alone time and I do like my job. And then of course there is the attempt to switch ""God will take care of my financial situation"" to ""This situation is hopeless"". Alas, what can you do, eh?
So I do another survey...

46 Things You'd Never Think to Ask...

1. Have you ever been searched by the cops?
Technically? yes. But only because my grandpa was and my uncle is a cop...and they would ""practice their moves"" on us in the pool...

2. Do you close your eyes on roller coasters?
Roller Coasters are one of my very favourite friends. Open Eyes. Hands up. Yelling. Not screaming - there is a difference. Yelling is like - ""Woohoo"" Screaming is - ""Ahhhhhhhhh..."" Get it?

3. When was the last time you've been sledding?
Sometime last December...

4. Would you rather sleep with someone else, or alone?
Either? I could care less...as long as they don't take all the blankets and leave me freezing in a strange house I have never been in before where I don't know where to find extra blankets and am forced to put track pants and a sweater over my pyjamas....ha ha...good times...

5. Do you believe in ghosts?
Not ghosts...but I think there are parts to this world we can't see...

7. Do you think O.J. killed his wife?
Don't know. I was kinda young when that all went down.

9. Can you honestly say you know ANYTHING about politics?
I know enough to get by in a non-political oriented group of people.

10. Do you know how to play poker?
I played Texas Hold 'Em a few times...but I wouldn't say I have an understanding of the game.

11. Have you ever been awake for 48 hours straight?
I made it to 43 once...but then I fell asleep (at the hospital actually...long story) and I woke up like an hour later staring straight into this old man's butt...very nice...

12. Have you ever cheated on a test?
No.

13. Who was your first crush?
Ha ha. You don't know him. Ask me later :)

14. If you're driving in the middle of the night, and no one is around would you run a red light?
No. I am a patient driver ha ha. And a law-abiding citizen. Actually, one so law-abiding that I sort of get anxious when cop cars drive passed me and I think for a second that it could be me - I could have done something wrong...but then realize it's obviously not ha ha...

15. Do you have a secret that no one knows but you?
Probably, depends on the person I guess.

16. Boston Red Sox or New York Yankees?
Red Sox's for sure...hands down...I almost loathe the Yankees...

17. Have you ever been ice skating?
Yes. Lots. Don't particularily love it, but it is nice every once in awhile.

18. How often do you remember your dreams?
Pretty much ever time I have one...I love my dreams :)

19. When was the last time you laughed so hard you cried?
Hmmm...possibly came close on Saturday...when the price was right for pool demolishing...can't remember before then...

20. Can you name 4 songs by The Beatles?
MAXWELL'S SILVER HAMMER :), Hey Jude, Love Me Do, I Wanna Hold Your Hand...

21. What's the one thing on your mind?
Lots of stuff. 

22. Do you believe in love at first sight?
I believe in great like at first sight...

23. Do you know who Ba-Ba-Booey is?
Nope.

24. Do you always wear your seatbelt?
Yes. Except for the rare occasion when the car is so full that putting on your seatbelt might result in a harassment suit...

25. What talent do you wish you had?
Teleportation would be nice right about now.

26. Do you like Sushi?
Never tried it.

27. Have you ever narrowly avoided a fatal accident?
Nope. Never actually been in one so...

28. What do you wear to sleep?
An old t-shirt/tank and old shorts/sleep pants...

29. left or right?
You can place the cheque you owe me in my left hand, thanks for asking.

30. Does size matter?
Yes - I would like the cheque to be made out for a million.

I wouldn't take it to ""truly hate"".

I'll listen to both.

34. Do you know anyone in jail?
Nope.

35. Have you ever sang in front of the mirror?
Yeah sure. It's not often intentional...I just always play music so...

36. What food do you find disgusting?

Yeah...I can be a jerk sometimes...

40. Have you ever stood up for someone you hardly knew?
Yeah.

No. But I do always wonder how I would do in a fight...not that I am going to go get in one...

42. Who was the last person you danced with?
Hmmm...New Years' Eve Steve? ha ha

43. Do you own any stuffed animals?
A few. Well, I own lots, but only like one of them travels with me...I've had it since Day 1...so it's kinda special :)

44. When was the last time you tripped?
June 12th, 2006 at 12:34am...just kidding...I don't know...not really one of the things I write about in my journal ha ha...

45. Do you have a major crush on someone?
Nope. And it's not one of those...yes I do but I won't tell things either...so you can stop guessing :)

46. Do you miss someone right now?
Yeah - tons of people. That's why I wanted the whole teleportation thing."

"event","I have been enjoying some of my favourite summer days as of late...
Friday was busy like death at work and I ended up staying an extra three hours because someone called in sick. By the end I was nearly falling over, but it was all good - money earned :) Except, staying late caused some confusion in my pick-up time and I had the cell phone relay of my life trying to find my dad and get him to work instead of dorm. However, when all was said and done, I got to relax at home with the parentals and Curto and watch my beloved ""So You Think You Can Dance""...good times...ask me about my ""hip - hop"" dance ha ha...practicing up for my uncle's reception :)
Saturday was GLORIOUS :) and then :) again.
I had taken the day off for a party that never came to be, so I got to relax, sleep in, watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off because it was on tv (I had previously been a virgin to that movie...I know, shocker...) Then the whole family, for the first time in a bit because of clashing schedules, headed for a nice swim 'n tan at Grandma's. Jay and Jackie were there with Indy and Jackie's parents came too. So it was a PAR-TAY! Did the swim thing and the tan thing and then the BBQ thing after...favourite part of summer.
Then, Krystal came and I got to hang out with her and Kala for a bit, playing some Trouble...discovering our near IDENTICAL dreams about the first day of school (and I had mine the night before her's...trust me, they are so identical it is CREEPY)...then we teamed up with the boys for a swim at Brady's...my second swim that day - could life be more perfect?!
Oh man, Brady's was probably the funniest thing ever. I drove up with Ben (Price) and Cliff...good times rockin' out to classic tunes like Relient K and the Insyderz...So we got there and started swimming, being crazy and such. Cliff decides we should play a game where ""as you jump off the board someone shouts an animal and you have to act like and sound like that animal""...good stuff. Except for Camel...how do you do that one?!
And then...Ben broke the bottom step of the ladder. ha ha. All he did was go up the ladder...and he snapped the bottom step IN HALF ha ha. Oh man. He was all like, ""I am never coming back again, I am so sorry"" and then a little while later, he went to do a gainer...and broke the DIVING BOARD. HA HA. I almost died. Poor guy...the smallest guy there even. I never laughed so hard. But at least we now had a slide...All there was left to do was slice the liner with his fingernails...he had already destroyed two of out their three pool accessories ha ha.
Then we hot-tubbed it. And overflowed it like crazy. All Lindsay's fault ha ha. So yeah, that was good times. Then we got measured on their door, and I saw Kristine's name and was like...aww Kristine...but THEN, I got home and she had emailed me and was like, ""Hey...how about if I come down the 26th and 27th!"" Yay. So next week :) (Sorry Krystal...boo that...)
Yeah. And then yesterday was church time and Fathers' Day. It was great. Good old Stevie (Mc)Adams spoke. Love that guy. Worked a bit. Home. Frisbee with Naomi. Helping Tim and Stacey move a few things in...talking to them a bit about dorm and such. And then I came up, and Kristine phoned :) So yeah, good good weekend.
Today I am off to work for a few hours and then roommate Bible Study at night. Reading Esther for it. I love that book. She is a crazy incredible woman.
And then tomorrow I have off - so operation whitey darkey it is :) Love the old swim 'n tan...
Now I am off to get ready for work. Woohoo."

People. People who take advantage of your time, your energy, your anything really...people who simply don't take the time to think considerately. 
My story doesn't really have to do with that, I just don't like it ha ha. In a lesser degree, I had a classic example of the kind of customers who makes my day long...
An older husband and wife came in during one of our busier periods in the day. Not crazy busy, but busy enough. The husband was putting the groceries on the till. The wife was there for a second, then left. I had all the groceries rung through, the husband was starting to bag 'n box the groceries and it was clear we were waiting for more items from the wife. She came a minute or two later with two or three items. Put them down without a word and took off again. It obviously didn't take long to ring those three things in, so we waited again. She came back, put two more things down again without a word. Looked over, saw apple, went and got one. Came back, put it down. Then before I could grab it, snatched it back up again and went and put it back, ""Oh ha ha I decided I didn't want it after all."" Great. She bugged me.
Had another old man sing to me today. Possibly the same guy as last time, I have a hard time remembering what all the old men look like...they are so similar you see...but I am pretty sure it was the same guy that sang to me before. This time he watched up to me and as he did sang just the line, ""Falling in love with you..."" and trailed off into humming (he seems like the kind of guy that just hums all the time). 
In other news, I find it slightly disturbing sometimes to ring in our meat products. Like it gets kind of creepy sometimes. We have these frozen fish. Seriously - like a WHOLE fish...frozen...in a bag with a price sticker. They come through surprisingly often and I am like holding this thing by the eye ha ha. It is especially creepy when I am really busy and I am in the fast pace mode of just grabbing stuff and putting it through without really even paying attention and then I look down and I am holding a fish ha ha. Or we have refrigerated fish...that are whole (small ones) but not frozen. They are on one of those trays with plastic wrap over it so I will grab it and literally like grab the eyeball...sick. ha ha
Yeah, that's about all the excitement over here."

"event","First, I am turning Scottish...
Not really, but I, of course, have another story to tell. Is it an old man story you ask? What other stories do I have this summer??
I think I have finally realized how naive I STILL am ha ha...I always thought old men were sweet grandpas :) I maintain my position and simply protest that I have simply met ALL the exceptions this summer :) 
This morning I got a surprise wake-up call from my boss. I got call in (yay) because someone decided to be sick today. So I got to work 9:30-1:30, a nice surprise and a little extra cash. Afterwards Naomi and I did the ""swim 'n tan"" at Grandma's. Let me tell you - the freckles are coming out nicely this year as well as the tan and blonde hair to the extreme! Operation Whitey Darkey is in full force for its second summer :)
So, my story.
Working away - it was pretty constant today which was nice. I didn't get a break for three hours of four, but I didn't even care, the time went by fairly quick and I would much rather have a late break than an early one. Anyway, here I was, a cute little Dutch girl working away with a smile on her face but not even showered or make-up applied as I rushed to work this morning to get there as quickly as possible. This didn't stop the old perve though. I see him a mile away - strutting around the store, button shirt partially un-buttoned, gray hair blowing in the breeze...he approaches the till with the absolute ODDEST conversation starter I have heard yet at grand old Food Basics. ""Tell me something!""
""Ok...it's nice outside?""
""Yes it is - why aren't you out there in your bikini?""
""Um, because I am poor and need to work."" (what else do you say to that? ha ha)
""It's because of me, isn't it?""
(Naive I assume he means the store needs to be open for customers to shop?) ""Yeah?""
""It's because creepy old men like me would be looking at you!""
(Mouth partially open in disbelief to the actual words escaping his mouth)
""If you were out there, I would be looking! I have to be honest...if you were out there, I would definitely be looking at you!! ha ha""
(Mouth still partially open - I think a small, very nervous laugh escaped...)
I think he might have still been talking, but I was off in my safe place :) Well, not really but I wasn't listening as intently as I could have...I think he may have started packing up the groceries because when I was finished ringing his groceries in (which were not in large supply, thank goodness), I had to pause until he paid attention to tell him his total...
""You want money don't you? How much would you like?""
(Since he was being a joker, I decided to be one too...)
""Well, I would love a hundred bucks but you only owe me $14.11.""
""ha ha Well you would be worth it!""
Fumbles through his wallet thinking aloud about whether he has enough cash...then he goes to the secret part of his wallet...
""Ah yes, my secret stash of money (literally...a whole bunch of 50s)...my wife doesn't know about it. Sometimes I tell her I don't have any money. But I am lying. All men are liers. Did you know that?""
I laugh a little.
""Are you married?""
""No.""
""Well, when you get married, you remember that when your husband says he doesn't have any money...he really does.""
""Ok.""
He finally pays me. Before I finally got him out of the store, he pauses...
""I like you...(looks to my name tag...conveniently located?) Katie. You are fun. Bye hon, have a great day!""
Alright. Super. Thanks for being creeper. Go home to your wife you perv.
PS. Whoever is sending these men into the store to creep me out, good joke, but really...maybe just send one of their really sweet, athletic grandsons in next time?! Thanks. ha ha."

So I got my weekly newsletter from youthministry.com today, a nice little email I like to get...fun games to try, interesting thoughts, it's good stuff...
Anyway, this one had a link that was introduced with, ""What happens when you drop a Mentos into a bottle of Diet Coke? Find out now..."" Well clearly I clicked the link, I mean, who wouldn't?!
It takes me to this link: http://eepybird.com/dcm1.html (go to it...now!)
I watch the video and obviously go out immediately to try it out myself. I walk over to Zehrs, half doubting that it is actually going to work, but half quite excited about making my very first experimentation video :) The sky was also very pretty on the way over, so it made me happy and pushes my evil doubting thoughts aside even more. I come back, still excited by the sky and getting pre-experiment jitters.
I run upstairs to grab my trusty camera. Chelsey asks me what I am doing, and I tell her, to which I get a...""oh...okay...well, let me know how it goes...come back alive..."" I don't think she was very excited for me.
So I go outside, and the mosquitos are crazy right about now. Oh well, nothing will step in the way of science. I got myself set up, and started filming the masterpiece. And sure enough, it worked!! It wasn't extremely spectacular, being my first time and all...but who knows, before I get that second job I will have LOTS of time on my hands to perfect it :)
Anyway, if you want the video of this masterpiece, just ask :)

What is worse than living with turtles trying to solve their problems?
(These days have occurred over the past few days - luckily not all in one night...be warned - they are quite strange...)
How about getting chased by a white squirrel with purple eyes in my bedroom?...somehow it got into dorm so I was chasing it around all scared-like. I was trying to usher it out the door to go down to first floor so it wouldn't get in my apartment. Then it was in a soup can for some reason - so I very boldly picked it up and throw it against the wall, ran into my apartment and locked my door. Whew. Suddenly, I was in my room and it was there and this super creepy white squirrel with purple eyes was chasing me around my room...luckily I then woke up.
Continuing with the animal dreams...Brad, Shelby, my parents and myself were eating dinner in the back corner of the chapel. (??) Suddenly, I looked up to the ledge by the chapel ceiling, and there was this huge raccoon running around there, and coming towards us! He jumps down and starts booking it right at us!! All of a sudden, Brad grabs a bat (from who knows where) and hits the raccoon...his head coming completely off (??) and then I think we finished eating...
Or how about a dream where I was at a hockey game with random people (Heritage people, Glenview people, youth group people...) and all of a sudden, Chasity was there. Then we did this really girly running/screaming thing because we were happy to see each other and both almost fell onto the ice...Oh yeah, and of course all the hockey players were about 60 years old. Great. 
And then, last night I dreamt that CCS was putting on this wrestling fundraiser!! ha ha Krystal and I went and I kind of had the feeling that the blue wrestler was my boyfriend or something and the only thing I knew about the red wrestler was that he was a Japanese Canadian (?? ha ha) So yeah, we were watching this wrestling match and after awhile I decided to wrestle too (like join the actual wrestlers) and Krystal might have too. All I know is that I did and afterwards Krystal was mad at herself for not thinking to take pictures when I was in there wrestling. Hmmm...after it was finished, Krystal and I went to the cafeteria. Except this cafeteria was SO weird!! (of course) To get in the line, you had to go down this hanging rope climbing wall thing (you know like on American Gladiators - the rope walls they climb up??) Anyway, there was two of them, so you had to go down one, let go, slide down a dirt hill for a minute, and then try and grab the second one. If you weren't successful in grabbing it, you just had to slide down the dirt hill for the rest of the way. At the bottom of the dirt hill was an ice rink. So after you made it down, you had to shuffle along the ice and then climb up a rope wall and get in the cafeteria line. From here on in, it was a normal cafeteria (??). ha ha ha oh man. So we go there and Krystal turns into Kala on the rope wall (??)...Kala doesn't made the snag onto the second rope wall and slides down the hill...that is all I remember...
Yep, so I think this proves that I am clinically insane.
In other news, I talked to my boss about getting a second job and she is possibly trying to get me more hours. Plus I handed out resumes at Shoppers, the Dollar Store and Blockbuster so far. I have this deal with my boss that if I get a second job I will still work Saturdays and Sundays (after 1:30) and then am available 3:30-close Monday-Friday. So I go to Blockbuster - it was so funny. The lady is like, so can you work 9-5...I was like, Well, I think it says it in my resume, but I can only work until 2:00pm...
Then she keeps going, ""Well, can you work 12-9?""...um...no. ""Okay, can you work 5-12?"" um...depending on my other job...""Okay, can you work 12:00am-9:00am?"" oh yeah, I can work that for sure...
So basically I handed in my resume but can't really ever work unless they will hire me for night-shift inventory stuff. So we shall see...
Had a meeting with Mark together so make sure we are both on the same page for STUCA. T-shirts almost ready to be ordered. Excited. However - quite nervous that they won't turn out like everyone expected them to and then I will be this big loser that gave STUCA crappy t-shirts we have to wear for the year ha ha. They will be great I'm sure. Serge makes good shirts ha ha.
Alright...time to...do something I am sure. Today is errands day. Got OSAP stuff handed in, went to the bank, work to talk to MaryAnn, resumes, meeting, figured out my voicemail (oops)...ha ha stupidest message ever, I HATE answering machines...and yep, sitting around for a bit before I go play some tennis with Sage. :)"

"event","So, if there was any confusion before as to whether I really did belong in a mental institution under serious care for my obvious condition of insanity, the foggy banner has lifted as my night-time mind wanderings continue with increased insanity.
On Thursday night, I went to bed expecting to sleep peacefully, dream sweetly and wake up rested. Instead, I went to bed and was quite comfortable, but my dreams did not follow suit.
With an intro that is extremely complicated and not interesting enough to mention, the bulk of my dream boiled down to a conversation, recalling a very strange event. It was myself, my parents, Brad and Shelby, Jaclyn and her parents. I was sitting facing the rest of them for some strange reason. My mom goes on to tell us a story. ""Yesterday,"" she says, ""Mom (my grandma) came to the house to drop something off but no one was here. She has a key, so she let herself in. She walked down the hall and veered right to go to the kitchen. Upon entering the kitchen, she saw Mrs. Baverstock taking a bath in our piano bench."" Needless to say, mom went on about how we were going to have to get a new piano bench.
That is when, in the dream, that I GASPED rather loudly. One, that is just absurd. Two, our piano bench is literally as long as the length from my knee to my foot (we measured it in the dream and surprisingly enough it turned out to be true in real life...WEIRD). It is also maybe three or four inches deep with a very thin bottom and only about six inches wide. Mrs. Baverstock is clearly an adult. Plus, she is one that I have probably not spoken more than a few sentences to in my entire life, so how she made the dream, I don't know.
Anyway, that is the latest story in my book of crazy crazies. Don't be creeped out :)"

"event","Today, I welcomed back my precious and very fun short hair as a sign of summer officially starting and the long hair getting officially too hot :)
Yesterday, the CUTEST little girl came through my till - a very nice break from the old men!! (Although, the way I figure - the old men could lead me to their grandsons...and seeing as I need to be married by August 24th ha ha...I better get going!!)
Anyway, as soon as this girl (probably 4) came up to my till, she was like, ""HI!! My name is Madelyn!""
I was like, ""Hi, my name is Katie"" and I showed her my name tag...
Then she was walking around and went to the end of the belt. I asked her if she wanted to push the button (to move the groceries down) so she did and was laughing away. Then she was helping her mom put groceries in bags and smiling like crazy. Then she grabs a 2L of pop and walks over to me and puts it over her head, ""I am SO strong...see?""
I was like, ""Wow!! You ARE really strong!""
Then she was helping her mom some more...then they had to leave, so she starts walking backwards (facing me) and she left, ""BYE!! Bye! Remember, my name is Madelyn and my phone number is 555-5555 (made up obviously, I didn't really even hear anyway)...remember Madelyn, 555-5555! You could phone me sometime...Madelyn...555-5555"" and she kept saying it until she was gone ha ha. It was SO cute :) Made my afternoon.
Got to play volleyball last night and watch some sweet ""So You Think You Can Dance"" HA HA. Love that show. The guy who wanted his stage name to be ""Sex""...""You know, sex...sexy, sexual, anything sex related really"" ha ha and his big dance move was shuffling sideways! AND, he came with his mom who like to tell us that he had a LOT of VERY sexy moves ha ha and that he has won many awards as a ""dance person"". But yeah, Musa Cooper - now he is amazing...for real. So crazy. I figure that I should marry a black break dancer and then at our wedding dance, while he is going crazy, I will be beside him going, ""Hey-a...ho-o...go (insert name here), go(insert name here)..."" waving my arms and then bust out my SWEET dance moves ha ha...that would be great.
So yeah...that's pretty much all that is new. Working on getting the STUCA t-shirts ready...choosing colours and getting the design figured out...(Hence doing a sweet job).
So yeah, very exciting life. Good stuff.
Now I am off for more excitement...maybe to get working on meeting that husband of mine :) ha ha
Later days..."

"event","Okay, so remember creepy old man from yesterday?
(And yes, after more thinking I do agree with the hand sanitizer comments...)
Well his twin came in today. Or his brother, or something. Like seriously, they HAVE to know each other or this is just weird.
So I am working away like a good, innocent, non-interested in old men girl...it isn't too busy and the morning has been rather pleasant. This old man (of course) comes through the till with some groceries. We start the whole ""I am serving you and have to be nice to you and I have nothing better to do so I may as well be nice back plus I am trying to hit on you thing""...which has become my routine with old men, sad as that is...
Same as yesterday - everything he says, he adds a ""wink wink nudge nudge ha ha don't you just love me"" smile and laugh bit, I am not impressed. Then I give him the total - not much, around 20 bucks and he goes, ""Well, aren't you an expensive woman!""
I was like, ok.
Then he continues ""That's what the other guy said, isn't it?!"" (I am assuming the guy from yesterday or he is just really strange...)
I was like, ok...yeah. (what??)
He continues of course, ""But you are worth every penny, aren't you??!.......Yep, quality for the money with you...""
Smile and nod.
So there you go. I seem to attract the old men like bees to honey...now only if one of them had a grandson ha ha :)

In other news, went swimming with Petra, Jackman, Chelsey and Naomi today. LOVELY. Getting a beautiful tan and lots more freckles. Youth. Played some freezing cold ""steal the watermelon on a tarp in a freezing cold water-soap-bean mixture"", that was good times. Mike called for Kala and I when we were gone, calling tomorrow. I assume to hear the officially ""sorry but no thanks"". We are probably FINALLY hearing (after just over two weeks) because I emailed him yesterday being like, ""Hey Mike. I guess the silence is a bad sign, eh? Just wanted to say that I am sorry that the funding didn't come through, would have loved to work there blah blah...so let me know the official no so I can look for a different second job..."" So yeah. It will be good to have the official word because really I am still hanging onto the hope that I could still be working there ha ha. I just really really really wanted the job. Curious to see what God's plan is, the ride has sure been interesting. 
The whole time I have had a great feeling about it, a definite peace. After hearing about the re-interview though, I started to think that maybe this might just be a big lesson in faith and trusting God...and I mean it worked, so I guess I would say I am content if that was the sole purpose of this whole thing. I was SO stoked about the job though, I can't even tell you. Like I even had my camp counselor all picked (we don't use our real names). My grandma thought of it - Jetski. Because my first Jessie doll I had when I was little I very originally named Jessie. But my Grandpa would always called it Jetski to get me ha ha. He did things like that a lot. Half the people at church had a different name according to him ha ha. 
I just love working with kids so much - they give me energy. You can totally be your stupid self and they love you, sometimes instantly. I am enjoying Food Basics a lot, especially as I get to know my coworkers more. But there is just that something in doing what you love...
That is actually how Lucado's new book (that I just got) starts out - trying to help you figure out what you love, what God put in your heart to love so that you can use what God gave you to glorify Him. He describes using your everyday life, your strengths towards God's glory to find your ""sweet spot"". That is the first section which I read the other night. The other two sections will deal with how to make a big deal out of God and then how to do this in everyday life. When I was reading it, I was like...seriously God - I had that job...you know, the one that I will love more than anything...and now I don't, what's up with that? 
But yeah, we will see what happens. Truthfully like I said, I haven't given up hope that I could still get the job (even though I don't have my first aid and there is no way for me to get it before the job would start ha ha), and probably won't give up hope until like the middle of August :)
Yeah, that's it for me today.
Get to play volleyball tomorrow night at Forward :)
Ooooh and a hair cut Friday...yay."

This guy came through, with his wife I should add, and was all like ""I am going to flirt with you and creep you out"". Good plan buddy, definitely an original idea, I seriously suggest you keep it up.
Everything I said he had a laughy ""wouldn't you like that"" attitude about it. 
""Would you like some bags sir?"" 
""Oh, hmm...I'm not sure ha ha...what do you think ha ha, (I am so funny ha ha)...I guess I better with all those groceries I am buying ha ha (I am rich and I know it ha ha)...I am going to go broke doing this all the time ha ha...(says his wife's name) you need to come in first so you can pay this girl...ha ha well, it is probably woman, isn't it ha ha""
(SHUT UP) Instead I just smile and nod of course.
Finally, I have rung through all his groceries and withstood his ridiculous conversation. 
""Okay, so your total is $33.35 sir.""
""Wow! You are an expensive woman!!""
I nod. What? Pay me you creepy old man.
He finally left, thankfully.
Man, I really don't like creepy old men.
The ones I hate the most are the ones you hold out their stupid hands full of change and make ME pick through their sweaty palm of change to get the right coins...like seriously, they can't do it themselves? Do they think I find some enjoyment in this? Do they think they are making my day? ""Oooh you will never guess what happened today. I actually got to touch this creepy old man's sweaty palm and sort through his coins to get the right change. Ahhh! I know, I am SO lucky!! I LOVE my job :)""
Gag me.

"event","Okay, so last night I was talking to Chasity on MSN, and when we were saying goodbye, she said ""pleasant dreams"" because we had been chatting about how I have oddball dreams. I don't know if she was cursing my night-time mind wanderings or if she was trying to reverse the very obvious curse I have...because last night's dream may have been the oddest one of my life.
I hope I remember it all...it was SOOOOOOOO weird. Like I woke up super confused. Alright, here goes nothing.

I show up at someone's house where the youth are gathering to go on a road trip, Creation maybe. I was planning on going but at the last minute I tell Bryan forget it because I am too poor. So me and Trish Elgersma (?) take off in this car. She drops me off at this apartment building where I guess I am staying. It wasn't ever made really clear, but I am sure that it was a sort of rehabilitation place (because I am poor? I don't know...never knew it was a disease...) I walk in to see two unkept and not incredibly skinny people sitting on this tattered couch in a very messy and dirty apartment. The lady (it is a man and lady sitting there) is picking at her belly button (I KNOW...I NEED HELP!! ha ha) and I was confused as to what I was doing there. I put my stuff in my room and after what seems to be a time lapse in the dream, I am back again...and here is where it gets weird...I am now living with two very deranged and definitely not normal looking TURTLES. I AM LIVING WITH TURTLES...okay, problems people, I have problems.
Okay, I think it is at this point where I am discussing with one of the turtles the problem he is having with his father - something about how his father is trying to tell him what to do or how to live his life or something like that...you know, normal turtle things!! HA HA
Some more time lapses and now we are at the apartment and this turtle's father comes. (Oh no, this means trouble) So I try to talk to this father turtle but he pushes me out of the way and behind the door as he goes to talk to his son.
Time lapses...
I am now at Food Basics. ha ha.
But it isn't a normal Food Basics, it has this added-on party room or something. And a whole bunch of people are there...(for my birthday I think)...I spend a lot of time talking to Roslyn (I have no idea why) I also spend some time doing sit-ups in Food Basics HA. Seriously, I do. I am even wearing my uniform - but I am not working...so I guess I am officially a Basics Nerd!!
Okay, so I mingle for a bit, then go wandering in the store. Suddenly I lay on the floor and start doing sit-ups. Peter and Joyce Lambert (??) walk by as this actual FB guy is helping them. Joyce stops and comments about my legs. WEIRD.
Then I go back and talk to Roslyn some more. She was talking to some kids and I join in and then somehow turn the conversation to my new cell phone :) ha ha. Then I add Roslyn into my contact list and somehow it also allows me to like sign her up for this volleyball league (???) ha ha. Then it fast forwards to Roslyn serving the ball and it destroys the net and people are mad at her.
So then I talk to her about what kind of job she should get. (????) So yeah. I suggest that she should work at a boardwalk store, like Booster Juice! Then we read the requirements and learn that anyone above the age of 9 can work there! (Since when is that a good idea??)
Anyway, this is about where I woke up, and good thing too!! Who knows what would have happened next?!

Now that you think that I do drugs (which I don't :), for the record)...the dream actually makes some sense...
1. I have been thinking about Hamilton - so that explains the almost road trip, being poor (well everything explains that ha ha...I AM poor), talking to Roslyn and talking about Booster Juice (and possibly the whole rehab helping people thing??)
2. I read a whole book yesterday because I was seriously so bored. One of the girls in it really liked turtles and they would always visit the beach and go to the boardwalk stores.
3. I have been doing sit-ups lately, just when I have spare time, so that explains me hopping onto Basics' dirty floor...I guess I was bored?
4. Basics - I'm always there.
5. It was just my birthday and I got a cell phone, so that explains that.
6. My mom told me the other day that I can come play volleyball Thursday.
But the random Trish and Lambert pop-ins? I have NO idea.
Other than that though, a pretty sensible dream I figured :)"

"event","So today I decided to go for a nice little walk...
To the bank (by good old Basics), to Old Navy, to Walmart, and then back home. Okay, so it took 2 hours including the store browsing time. 
I figured I may as well though. I vowed to at least try and walk for a half hour on non-working days (in not pouring rain weather) and I'm not working today, so there you go. I am also trying to do the 100 full situps a day thing. Sometimes it pushes to every other day depending on the sore factor of my ab or other things. But I try to stick to everyday - especially because I know that if I said every other day, it would turn into never.
So yeah, walk time.
Like always, I didn't quite think it through enough. I never remember my backpack when I do groceries (and then am dying on the way back because I always forget about the walk and buy way too much) and sure enough, I forgot the backpack again today. Oh well.
I walk up to the bank and then trudge on towards Old Navy. It is at this point that I realize I have never really walked this whole route before and am finding my whole experience quite the off-road one - walking through rock paths, which subsequently find their way into my sandals, and through bushy paths. I made some thorny new friends today. Shortly after realizing my very unaware state, I find myself directly beside and above the 401. Now Katie, being a girl who doesn't particularly love heights a whole deal, did not anticipate this section of her adventure. There is something about walking directly above hundreds of transport trucks going who knows how fast with only a little cement barrier stopping you from hurling to a bloody and tragic death that is a little unnerving. 
Oh well, I trudged on. And by ""trudged"" I clearly mean 'walk cautiously and every once in awhile touch, though not grip, the railing as a reminder that I am indeed safe walking here'. If you had been in your car driving past me with your window down, you would have heard some quiet ""woah-o...okay...alright...I'm good...wo-ho-oh..."" as I walked, the adrenaline from the sound of hundreds of speeding cars pumping.
(It didn't really occur to me until now that I just wrote that above piece as a 20 year old. Hmmm...maybe I should try this adult-maturity-nonbaby scaredy cat thing a little more seriously...)
So anyway, here I was, walking to Old Navy - a store now visibly off in the distance. It is at this point that my side reminded me that I didn't really want to be walking anymore. Oh well, at least if I pass out, I have time to use my handy-dandy one touch dialing to punch in ""2...Talk..."" on my way down. This will trigger a call home - possibly the exact moment my parents foreshadowed in purchasing this beautiful little cell phone (with sweet rings) for my birthday. 
I hit up Old Navy for a very successful trip. It is upon entering the store that I realize how much of an Old Navy loser I am. I walked in wearing two Old Navy tanks and Old Navy shorts. Hmmm...poser child or Old Navy mascot wannabe?? Tough call. I leave the store with two new skirts (one a blue version of my pink stripe one, and a funky brown and copper flowery african looking one), a pink striped golf tee and two ""perfect tees"" (brown and a bright reddish). Very fun stuff.
I hit up Walmart next to find myself a new mouse. My old one is more than frustrating - it would sometimes take three or four tries of rolling the mouse just to open up a document and those four rolls would often also include a fierce blow with my hot air into the bottom where the ball rolled around, slowly. Another successful trip. My mouse is working wonderfully.
I exit Walmart and again realize that I have never trudged from Walmart back to Heritage. A surprise, seeing as I have been at Heritage for two years, but still, the reality of the situation. Well, I know it's been done many times, so let's go...I will find my way as I walk :)
It really was as simple as I thought it would be. Walk briskly along the side of the highway, dodging traffic, clutching your bags, not falling over the edge (not quite as bad this time ha ha), sometimes moving by putting one foot in front of the other on the narrow walkway.
But I made it home. Safe and sound. New purchases in tact. And another epic tale of the Katie Times to write about."

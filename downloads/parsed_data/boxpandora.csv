I got nothing, except that i last updated 48 weeks ago, almost a full year.  thats kind of sad because this used to be my very favorite thing to do in the world.  I did sort of miss it.  But at least its one less thing to check compulsively while I am on the interwebs.  it sounds like I am typing very fast, and generally i can without looking at the keyboard, but every so often i have to look down and orient myself.  oh, you bitches.  i bet im the only one who remembered our SACRED PACT to revisit our sacred live journal.  i had thai food for dinner with my boyfriend tighe.  I had tom kha soup, which is so super yummy with coconut milk and red curry and lemongrass, and spicy basil noodles which tasted like everything else which is stir fried-- which is, greasy and kind of salty.  I much preferred tighe's pad thai.  i will have that next time.  we're going to have sunday night movie time-- wisconsin death trip, a documentary about a bunch of deaths in wisconsin in the 1890's, and pineapple express, which is supposed to be super funny. we'll see.  i sneezed, bless me!!!"

"event","some high and lowlights of christmas 07::

1.  my aunt's cocaine problem, confirmed.
2.  my cousin (the brother of the dead one) is either dealing/shooting the horse.
3.  i have reached a zen state of quiet and solitude.
    
     there was also a fantastic fight between cousins around 12 midnight which brought the house down!  i called the corner i was sitting in with my aunt jackie ""zen corner"", because thats where i sat and was quiet.  i honest to god don't think i said 5 sentences all night.  

4.  when my cousin (the one dealing/shooting the horse) said ""you know, jocelyn, you should really lose twenty pounds and firm up.""  what i said was ""i am walking away now.""  what i should've said was ""well, sir, you should get a job, and a place to live, and a family that gives a shit about you.""

    i am a little disappointed in the gifts this year.  gift cards and checks, although awesome and useful, are sort of anticlimactic to open.  my cousin got me an awesome bracelet which won't fit over my hand, so that has to go back.  and i also got a festive, seasonal doormat.  my family was waaaay better at gift giving when i was a kid.

and is it wrong that i sit in a room full of family and the conversation bores me to tears?
i came home early because i would much rather cuddle with my kitty.  ah, well.  :)"

"event","i feel like today is going to leave me with permanent frowny lines.  in between my eyes, right on my forehead.  and a distended lower lip.  is this only child syndrome?  at this point, i am medicated, this is not depression, this is not hypomania, this is a simple case of me not getting my way and i do not agree with it.  here is why!
   work:  1 hour phone call with the boss.  she yells...well, not yells, vehemently speaks.  passionately speaks, sounds like she is on a treadmill.  i say, uh huh, right, i understand.  basics of this conversation are that she is not happy with my store...and i do not see the things that she sees.  i think school is taking a little more time than i wanted.  but she is unhappy and i don't know how to make it better.  i have this pissy, stupid part of my personality which is a: a perfectionist and b: unable to ever achieve that level of perfection.  or rather, i concieve of a perfection that is impossible.  or something.  so i am on the phone, my head on the desk, frown frown frown.  pout pout.
      class::  my final project is due.  it sucks, i hate it, its not the right size, dirty pencil marks everywhere.  the last half hour of class that i was supposed to be perfecting, i frowned.  i tried erasing, i tried more,i tried everything i could, it sucked, i frowned.
    on the way home, i thought i lost my rose ring and i almost cried....but it was in my pocket.
   home::  a delinquent bill from columbia house?  quit sending me movies!!! i don't even want to belong to your stupid club anymore but you wont let me cancel goddamnit!  they will be receiving a phone call from me tomorrow.  and i missed a freaking credit card bill and now i owe them 200 hundred bucks and the canceled my special apr????  bastards!!! frownie!!!!  bank of america, prepare for my phone call!  i am glad i have off tomorrow afternoon for all my FREAKING PHONE CALLS YOU BASTARDS!!!
   and the thing that i won't, can't, talk about?
fucking froooooooown.  frown.  frown and pout and frown.  i want what i want when i want it and goddamnit, i want it.
on the upside, at least i have a warm apartment to come home to on nights like this."

    so at 5 am this morning there were 3-- THREE!!!-- little mices caught in the traps and struggling like mad to get free.  and the one was in a pile of pastry crumbs and gnawing off his own leg to get free and i felt so fucking awful.  like, poor little mousie was just trying to have a snack and then falls into a stupid glue trap and gnaws off his own leg.  and then gets taken outside to freeze to death with his buddies under a dumpster.
    i am aware it is just a mouse, but regardless, its a living being that spent its last moments on earth panicked and scared and cold and it sucks and i feel horrible and i hate being the cause of it.  i guess snap-traps are considered inhumane because if the mouse gets caught at a bad angle i guess it doesn't die right away. but struggling in a trap is just as bad.

"event","Fa'afafine (fah-fah-fee-neh) is a Samoan word which literally means ""like a woman"". A fa'afafine is identified as a male who takes on the identity of a female. They decide whether or not to wear female clothing, shoes, and/or cosmetics. Their female-like actions and behavior is the dominant factor in identifying them as fa'afafines. Most fa'afafines feel that they are real women trapped in a man's body. They reveal their ""true"" identity using their chosen , exotic ""stage"" names, beautiful hair styles, and finely shaved and decorated faces, and are always up for challenges.

My fa'afafine friends do not consider themselves to be gay. Through my literature review, I found this to be true for many of them. Fa'afafines strongly feel that ""Gay behaviors are different from their own - they consider themselves female and believe that the men who have relations with them also see them as females. Gays are straight men seeing other straight men"" (Poasa, p. 47). As said earlier, fa'afafines strongly believe that they are real women trapped in a male's body."

~ a pornography film i was watching, with cucumbers and whipped cottage cheese, and fake penises being shoved into muppet-looking female clams.  all of this was under water.

my menu::
9:00am:: iced venti americano
9:30- 11:15am::  random bites of sampled pumpkin loaf, approximately one half slice.
12:30 pm:: one half sandwich, roast beef and tomato on a sesame bagel with one cup soup, chicken tortilla. (that is not so bad.)
2:00pm 3/4 of a glazed donut.
2:15pm the rest of my iced venti americano, ew.

5:30pm: sugar free red bull, chugged enroute to class
7:45pm: half of a cheese danish, taken from work, in the middle of drawing class.
9:45pm: handful of potato chips and onion dip, diet pepsi.

i mean, seriously. and as i write this i feel so gross and disgusted with myself, and there is a commercial on for nutrisystem  (""i went from a size 14...to a size 4!!!!!!"").  not that chemically processed, freeze-dried scrambled eggs are the way to go (shasta had some nutrisystem food...i tried the eggs and the fettuccini alfredo, and you don't have to refrigerate any of it.  it's all dry and you add hot water.  it's very bizarre and tastes like cardboard and the inside of a plastic bag.)
   i will also be getting my monthly visitor in a few days.  so that may be why i am feeling like poo.  and i just read an article that women on anti-depressants tend to crave carbs.  like i needed something else to make me crave carbs!!!!
   on another subject, a woman on dr. 90210 is getting her clitoris and clitoral hood repositioned and her labia reduced.   i'm all for plastic surgery if thats what you want to do, but your clitoris?  it is your most perfect little bundle o' nerves.  leave her alone.
   drawing class...1 point perspective.  2 point perspective.  intuitive gesture drawing.  who knew how hard it is to draw a fucking aquafina bottle, a construction hat, a plastic tube, and a saxophone?  and in other school news...i decided that i heart the library.  not only does it house the designer resource room, but tons and tons of current periodicals, and about 30 computers with high speed internet.  most importantly, those computers have printers.  which means i can go in an hour early and type my papers, instead of shelling out for a printer right now.  score!
   and i have to go to niagra falls tomorrow for the big ol' holiday meeting.  5 hours on a bus and overnight in a hotel with all my co-workers.  this time next week i will be running my own store.  that is so very odd to wrap my head around.

general observations?
1. there are a lot of people in the building.  i know that seems silly, and obvious, but i haven't been around throngs of students since...2001.  and i was worried that i looked like a...weirded out, lost little bird.
2.  however, it is nice to be around a bunch of artistically inclined people.
3.  i was quite worried about my drawing skillz...we had to draw our neighbor, draw ourselves, draw an object in the room, ect.  i was so nervous to expose my incompetency.  but upon peeking around to the other students sketch pads, i was not half bad.  of course there are like, one or two crazy talented kids, but i was better than most of the people i peeked at.  which was awesome.  so i have nothing to worry about.  especially for not ever having had a drawing class before, all my random doodling over the years has paid off.
4. i met a dude in my major, good thing.
5. a kid a bummed a cigarette to thought i was 19.  19!!!!!!

"event","well, there is nothing quite like an intense bout of indigestion and general GI tract distress followed by a rousing chorus of headache and insomnia!   ROCK!  i suppose it all went wrong when i had two beers and a reuben for dinner...by the time i got home my belly was so very, very unhappy with me.  and honestly, my belly has been unhappy with me since i ate burger king onion rings saturday night around midnight.  things haven't been quite right since that glorious moment.  
     so i took a shower, drank a diet coke and being quite tired, went to bed. this was around 11:30.  I woke up at 1:30 in massive burning belly pain, causing me to raid my bathroom medicine cabinet for the one packet of alka-seltzer i knew was in there, somewhere.  I went back to bed.  then i woke up again about 20 minutes ago, and i don't know what is wrong with me.  I'm jumpy and shaky and my head is aching.  
   I think part of the issue is that i skipped my meds last night because my stomach hurt and i didn't want anything else in my system.  I tried going to the bathroom, I tried listening to my new playlist on my ipod, (which normally knocks me right out, much like a baby and a vacuum cleaner).  so whatever. i got up, took my meds, and now i'm watching the x files.  and i'm hungry, isn't that fantastic?
    i'm a little jumpy, also, because of my meeting with an admissions lady at the art institute tomorrow.  it turns out there is a one year program in residential design, complete with night classes.  all of a sudden, this terrible and impossible spectre of ""going back to school"" seems alot less impossible and more like i can actually accomplish this.  so i'm really excited to just do it already, but of course, the doubt rears its ugly head.  
   1.  now that i am actually excited about it, what is going to happen to prevent it from happening?
   2.  yes, i am somewhat adept at decorating my own space but i've never taken an actual drawing course in my life, not to mention color theory and perspective.  am i kidding myself?
   3.  the lady wanted to see some examples of my work and i don't have a single thing, other than one or two half-assed drawings i've done of my ex's aunts house because she had filled an entire built in with clay bowls and it looked horrible.
   4.  i am going to do my best to just believe i can do it already.  i have been talking about doing this for 5 years now.

2 more thoughts...
   you would think, in this day and age, that there would be quality programming on 24 hours a day.  i don't think it is fair that the early morning hours are left to infomercials...what of the unfortunate ones who cannot sleep and have nothing else to do?
   and OJ Simpson...you truly are the biggest asshole in the world.  i can only hope residual guilt for the murder of your ex-wife caused you to commit armed robbery in the hopes of getting arrested again.  either that or you are a borderline personality with narcissistic tendencies.

i don't know what to do now that i wrote all that.  c'mon, mr. sandman, bring me a dream?"

5. the lady that runs the new sushi place down the street from work is super nice!  i mentioned i had never had sake before, while i was picking up my sushi, and she busted out all the little sake glasses and 3 different kinds of sake, and proceeded to have me try each one and tell me all about it.   when i kill myself every day to be nice to people, it was really cool to have someone go through trouble for me.  it was also cool to go back to work with a little buzz, because how could i have said no to her?  and also, sake is niiiiice.

1.  when i eat something i really, really like, and i take a little taste of it, maybe before it is all the way prepared or heated or what have you, i shake my butt and do a happy little food dance.

2.  i sing long, involved songs to my cat, sometimes constructing full verse-chorus-verse-bridge.  normally they are bluesy and/or show tune-esque in nature.

3.  i hate cottage cheese and oatmeal more than any other foods.

4.  everytime i buy a frame with real glass, i inevitably break it the first time i try to use it because i always place it on the carpet.  everytime i crack the glass, and everytime i forget why.  

5. i love love love...america's funniest home videos.  i watch it almost every day.

6.  despite my outwardly clean apartment, i am a secret slob.  the inside of my refrigerator, my closet and inside all my drawers is a crazy mess.

7. when i was little, i very much wanted to be either indiana jones or a goonie.

"event","okay, so, my obsession with my boyfriend is getting out of control because easy tiger is such an amazing album.  last night, i dreamt he was performing at some sort of starbucks function and i was soooo excited and then he came and sat down with me, he was wearing all kinds of scarves around his neck like he was freaking steven tyler and whatnot, and we were talking, and then my stupid boss came over and started talking to me about biscotti and he left.  today, i had a co-worker talking about how we could both take a leave of absence so i could stalk him, and she and another co-worker would facilitate the stalking so it would seem like a coincidence when i finally tripped in front of him and coyly dropped my books.  but seriously folks, best album since cold roses, because honestly, although jacksonville and 29 have their shining moments, this is much more cohesive.

so i finally hung out with a friend last night, and once again, i am pretty much dragged kicking and screaming out of the house, and then i have a good time, and then i feel stupid.  the new friend is actually a pretty freaking amazing singer songwriter, and we spent the evening listening to music and he treated me to a 8 song acoustic set.  i have to say, i have never had a person play just for me, and it was really beautiful.  it wasn't like when you feel embarrassed because the person kind of sucks either..he played about 6 original songs and then a cover of ""st. ides heaven"" and ""only in dreams"" which was, adorably, 'dedicated to the girl in the front row.'
     how cute is that?  i really need to try and be less flaky.  it is good to break with convention once in awhile.
saturday night, i'm sitting at home because i have to open.  making a birthday mix for a special someone, and i am listening to it right now, and so far, i am pleased.
   i think the new medication isn't helping the slight hypomania, because i feel like i will never run out of words right now, like i shouldn't have ever started."

"event","well...i either had a great day off, or a most unproductive day off, depending on how i feel like looking at it.  first i made my way downtown and actually had time to sit down at an establishment with my bagel and coffee as opposed to standing up in the back of my store trying to wolf it down.  (although, i get really mad when i go into downtown sbux and certain people aren't wearing hats...yeah, i don't wanna wear mine either, jerkwad, but i do it, and i'm going to tell your goddamned boss)  then i got my hair freshly colored and cut, and i must say, it looks fabulous.  a lovely mix of dark dark brown with some red and caramel on top.  i heart my hair stylist.  then (and here is the...maybe i was quite unproductive part comes in)  i met a former co-worker in shadyside where i was treated to a 4 vodka tonic and 1 redheaded slut lunch, leaving me so tipsy i lit my cigarette backwards, something that is normally reserved for 1 am parties.  after we made our way out of the restaurant, we went into a little new agey shop where we giggled and whispered about feng shui and ugly fairy figurines, and i bought a little statue of buddha (to be placed in the southeast part of my apartment, to enhance my feng shui, and so i can rub his belly).  i did not return from my lunch, as it were, until 6:30, whenceupon i fell asleep until now.  okay, actually, it sounds like i enjoyed my day at least, so who cares if i drank all afternoon?

"event","okay.  i truly need some opinions here...was i the asshole, or was the mailman?

let me set the scene...i went to the grocery store, it's what, 90 degress outside, i'm hot, and not to TMI you all be i really, really have to go to the bathroom.

for some reason, the spot right in front of my house is always taken between 1pm and 3pm...by the mail carrier.  normally it is a female mail carrier who drives a white jeep liberty, and i only know this because i often get home from work around 1 30 pm and can't park in front of my house.  and let me just say...normally, i have no problem with this.

but today, i have a trunkful of groceries and i absolutely must visit the bathroom and its hot out, and there is some unidentified blue truck in front of my house, and no other visable parking spaces. i notice someone is sitting in the truck, so i think what the hell, pull up next to him, and honk.

he turns and stares at me.  i roll down my window, he stares at me some more.  i smile, say, ""may i ask you a question?""  and he ROLLED HIS EYES and got out of the truck.

""how long are you going to be parked there?"" i ask
""probably for the rest of the day,"" he says.
""well,"" i say, ""i have a trunk full of groceries, and thats my apartment right there, and i was wondering if you could move so i could park there?""

he looks at me, looks down the street, looks back and says, ""well, how do i know that?""

this is not the response i was expecting.
""umm...do you want to see my driver's license so i can prove that that is my house?""  i ask.

""why would that mean anything to me?""  he says.

so then we just kind of stared at each other for a second, and seeing that he was absolutely unimpressed i said, ""okay, clearly you are an asshole, never mind.""

so i then drove about a block away, found a spot, begin trekking down the street with my arms full of bags.  as he sees me walking, he gets in his truck and drives into the school parking lot across the street.  i'm like, wow, whatever.   so i am trying to get into my front door, and he yells across the street, ""is this parking spot better for you?  and i am not an asshole!""

""well, it's too late now dude, you just have a great day.""

""your name isn't on the parking spot lady!!!  if you would've just asked me nicely i would have moved!""

(keep in mind here that there are about three roofers across the street, enjoying the show, im sure)
""i did ask you nicely, and you just stared at me like i was some sort of idiot!""

""well so did you!  and i will be back tomorrow, lady, in the same exact place!!!!""

""AWESOME, HAVE A GREAT DAY BUDDY!!!!"" i yelled.  and then i slammed down my case of pepsi and a can exploded and sprayed all over my porch.

1.  i know i shouldn't have called him an asshole.  but he really was acting like one, i think, with the ""how do i know that?"" comment.  yeah, dude, i normally ask people to move so i can park there.  for the record, had i not had groceries and had to poop like crazy, i would not have cared!!!  i lived in philly, for godsakes and had to walk 7 blocks to my apartment from my car.
2.  now i'm paranoid that he will fuck with my mail and/or leave flaming bags of dog poop on my porch.

and funnily enough, now there is no one parked in front of my house.  free and clear.

so...any opionions?  because i am now consumed by guilt that i called the mailman an asshole.  not even, 'you are an asshole,'  but 'okay, clearly you are an asshole!'  so.  who is the jerk here?"

i miss acting.
i had maybe 9 lines all in all, and i have missed doing it so much, i didn't know how much, i hadn't been thinking of it at all.  i don't really know what to do with that right now.

i suppose i must thank the friend who thought enough of me to give me a part.  this is also the second time in a week that this friend has forced me out of my turtle shell and made me do something outside my comfort zone...i should probably thank him for that as well.  a lesser person would probably have given up on trying awhile ago.

five more days of work and then a weekend of birthday fun!  fancy dinner friday night, party saturday and zoo on sunday.  i just need to figure out what to do during the day saturday, my actual birthday.  i'm thinking manicure and pedicure, perhaps some shopping at the southside works or something psuedo fabulous.  anybody want to accompany me on that journey?

ryan broke his arm, so he could not play guitar.  so ryan just sang for about two full hours.  it was a small little theatre in which there were maybe about 200 people.  ryan sang many low key beautiful songs, kicking it old school with 'wildflowers' from Gold and 'everybod knows' from the as of yet unreleased album Easy Tiger.  ryan sang with a hoodie up around his head and white sunglasses.  he talked about horticulture, he talked about whales, he talked about drinking too many diet cokes.  his voice was lovely, and he closed the show with a cover of 'down in a hole' by alice in FREAKING chains.  
    although i did want to hang around the tour bus like a little band slut, i also thought i would not want to meet my one true love in such an undignified manner.  so.  ryan adams, i goddamn love you.  i have loved you for years, and i will continue to go on loving you...just like an air supply song. or was it reo speedwagon?  and one day i shall have you, oh i know it in my heart. :)

"event","i am relatively sure that boredom is a 'sin'. not that i believe in 'sins' per se, but i feel guilty for having nothing to do.  i am off tomorrow, and seriously, the only constructive thing i can think of to do is drink.  or go shopping.  but going somewhere to shop would require dressing, driving there, and chances are i would probably end up wandering around and not even buying anything like i normally do in moods like this, so there is no point.  plus i don't feel like being alone.  the biggest problem, i have found, with being single, especially when 95 percent of ones friends are in a relationship, is that i am alone almost all of the time.  i don't have anybody to hang out with on just, you know, normal nights.  like a tuesday.  also, most people have to work tomorrow, so i can't call someone to hang out when they have to wake up at 5 am.  therefore, i am alone on a tuesday night with no one to hang out with and i cannot think of what to do with myself.  shopping is out because i have no need to buy useless things.  i don't want to see a movie by myself.  i am not going to go out to a bar by myself.  i could call good ol' cap'n T but that would be a short lived entertainment at best. i'm not hungry.  i don't feel like cleaning, nothing to organize. i bought about 5 books two weeks ago but i find i don't feel like reading because my attention span is crap lately.  because my medication needs to be adjusted.  soooooooooooooooo...i'm bored and i feel guilty about it, amen."

"event","dear sir or madam

when i ordered my father's headstone, i said that it was very important to have 'he was the kind of the tote bags' inscribed upon it.  you tried to talk me out of it then, and i said i didn't care.

that was december!  it is now april, and you have called back, and tried to talk me out of it again! what part of 'i don't care what it costs, put it on there,' did you not get the first time?  i don't think i need to explain my reasoning to you, isn't the fact that i am paying 1200 bucks for a headstone enough?  can't i just get what i want?
   why can't i just have what i want goddamnit?"

"event","my dreams are getting absolutely out of control.  i'm dreaming about gassings and decapitations, druggings and telepathic flashes, and last night i dreamt that i was madly struggling to find a place to take a shower...and this somehow took me to the middle of the woods where i was attacked by insects.  but then everything was fine and i was having a party.  whatever."

"event","number 1.  i love savannah, and i believe savannah loves me as well.  i love my hostessess. it was worth the 13 hour drive.   some of my highlights were, 'do you wanna see something weird?', the good wind, and when eric shared his pizza with me.  i don't think i've ever been so quiet on a vacation in my life, i just sat back and everybody made me laugh like crazy.  the only thing i didn't like was that...really quite awful fannies restaurant.  my pizza was okay and everything...but it just sort of freaked me out
2.  i got mom'd.  i have never had a nosy, intrusive parent.  but while i was gone, my aunt jess watched my kitty.  and i got two calls from her, one that concerned the state of my cats litter box, the other the state of my refrigerator.  i got home to...all my dishes done, my refrigerator cleaned out (and certain perishables frozen) living room straightened, and my bed made.  which is all well and good, coming home to a clean house rocks.  but this morning i noticed that my christmas lihts had all been taken down and were in my closet.  when i asked my aunt about this, it turns out that my other aunt had come with her, and decided that my christmas lights were too juvenile and she took them all down.  i'm like, do i go into your house and take stuff off of your walls?
3.   i should have stuck with my boy fast, goddamnit."

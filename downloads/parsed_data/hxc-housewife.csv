my brother moved away to windsor, i'll probably rarely see him. and before he left i refused to hug him because the day before he said he would drive my friend home and then yesterday he wouldnt because there was ""no room"". she lives like 40 mins away and he was going RIGHT THROUGH her town but noo, he had to fuck me over. so i was pissed at him, and hardly even said goodbye to him so now i feel guilty as hell.

then my dog had a small stroke and could NOT get up, she even peed herself trying. so we decided its time, and were putting her down this week. <i>i'm killing my pet</i>...ugh, every time i think about it i cry. she's almost 16 and i got her when i was 4, i'm just so used to her being there. i've never had to put down an animal. why can't animals live as long as humans."

I was really mad because I was the only one out of my family who went. my sisters had such a bullshit excuse that I wanted to slap them. but whatever. we stopped by my aunts grave and left flowers.

awhile ago we had a 24 hour power outage (I think most of Northern Ontario did), which sucked. on the 3rd my stepbrother turned 18.

this Saturday I went to a casino for the first time. I spent $25 and won back $22.50. every time I put money in, it felt awful. I think it's safe to say I will never gamble again in my life. the whole environment was terrible. I got IDed left, right and center, people were walking into me, sleezebags were glued to the slot machines. the only reason I went was to see Wayne Brady, aka ""the black guy from Whose Line is it Anyway?"" he's actually really funny, and extremely good at improv."

so I was sort of freaking out, thinking ogod my brother is going to look mutated or something. he already has a mowhawk and a bridge piercing, I dont think he needs horrible burn scars all over his face.

buuttt, he finally called from the hospital and he was okay. he opened the anti-freeze lid on his car and it sprayed at him, and got his face and all over his back. you would THINK he'd of known better considering he works at an autobody shop. it was all bubbled and horrible looking. his face isn't bad now, but his back has turned into like a giant blister near the bottom, it looks so friggen sore and gross.

that night I made him sleep over because he was all drugged up on morphine and practically handicapped. but I was happy my big bwothar was okay (:"

I've never been on this one before but he said it's good particuarily for teenagers. he said I was <i>clinically</i> depressed which means I don't have anything to be sad about, I just have a chemical imbalance o_O which I don't really agree with but oh well

Conner wants me to go to Toronto next weekend to go shopping. I duno if it'll work because of all the crap going on right now. my dad always calls randomly during the day to check up on me. I think he thinks I'm going to kill myself or something. I know I've been distant and horribly, horribly unhappy with life lately, but I would never do something like that.

I had the weirdest epiphany yesterday. there's like this ledge beside my desk and it has this little mini booklet sitting on it. the cover says ""Smile, Jesus loves you"". it's been sitting there for like a year and I never look at it, for some reason. and yesterday I was feeling like, awful and wanted to sleep and never ever ever wake up. and I was secretly cursing God for not giving me a sign of his existence and then I glanced over there and read that. yeah, lame, but whatever! I don't care what people think! because it was awesome."

she's probably moving in with Mike and Brian for a month then getting a place with Matt. I duno. I don't wanna leave my humble little town. my mom lives in Barrie so she'd be thrilled, but my dad would be like ok no because he thinks Melissa isn't stable. to be honest I can't blame him because she's moved like 500 times. buuut the hairdressing school I may or may not be going to in October has a school in Barrie, so it could work to my advantage. anyway.

Rya and Robyn ended up DTing. my internet was out for a few days so I couldn't give ideas, but the DT is alright. colo is pretty shitty lately, just losing interest I guess. I play a ton of Maple Story. it's fun when you have someone to play with, so Cos and his brother play with me a lot.

on a random subject, my dad says I'm depressed again, hooray. so I have a doctors appointment mid-march to get put back on medication. he was crying a couple days ago, saying it was his fault for letting me get this bad. it isn't his fault, I stopped taking the medication on my own. I thought I could do it on my own, how dumb was that. it was weird, I've only seen my dad cry about 4 times in my whole life so he must have felt pretty shitty. I duno.

"event","yea so. like a week ago I was certain I was going to hairdressing school and was all set to apply and shit. then last weekend Nathan said dumb shit. it was completely random, too. don't even remember what it was, but it was some cheap shot at hairdressers. then Melissa was like ""Robyn's going to be one"" and then I felt like a dolt. THX LISSA.

that's the one thing I'm afraid of people thinking. shit like I'm only going to hairdressing school because I wasn't smart enough for college. truth is, I'd go to college if I wasn't so deathly scared of presentations. I don't even care about the work, I just really, really hate speaking in front of people.

don't even know why I'm saying all this. maybe because I'm bugging Ken about what he's going to be. GOD how do people just KNOW. fucking 17 year olds planning their entire career life. HOW. I'm 19 and I still have no fucking clue and it doesn't feel like I ever will. I was like crying this morning because I was telling my sisters what Nathan said and then I felt stupid and they tried to console me and I pretended it worked but I really just went away to cry more. I rule..!

everyone left kinda early, and Jordan and Matt wouldn't play Mario Party with us because they're nazis. and you NEED for 4 people because if you use computers I swear they cheat. aaaaaha then I discovered the coolest show ever, Kenny vs Spenny.

he's a really, really cute Jack Russell Terrier. he obviously wasn't a stray because he had a really nice suede doggy coat, smelled like shampoo, trimmed nails and a harley davidson collar o.o; (no tags). we're going to keep him for the night and tomorrow give him to the animal shelter and hopefully his owners will find him :/."

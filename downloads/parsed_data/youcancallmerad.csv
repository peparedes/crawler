i didn't move to germany, i moved to colorado. i've been here about two months now and i love it. a lot. 

i'm lusting after a 26 year old guy who is the spitting image of brandon flowers. and is also named brandon. YEAH FOR REAL. the age thing makes it weird though, damnit.

i'm getting my first car tomorrow and it will pretty much be the best thing to ever happen to me.

i bought a border collie puppy about two months ago. his name is tripp and he's 4 months old now. he is the sweetest, smartest, best dog i've ever had and i love him more than anything (yes, this includes my other two dogs..and cat, and rat, and snake, and fish. sorry guys.). <a href=""http://img530.imageshack.us/my.php?image=img8520copyii0.jpg"">here's a cute picture.</a>

"event","Woooo I have lots of updating to do. Here are reviews for Projekt Revolution, The Used, and Interpol. I know, my music tastes are all over the place. I'll start with Interpol because 1) it's the best and 2) it's the freshest in my memory and 3) this is going to be a really long entry, and Interpol needs easy access because I think more people will be interested in that than the others, hah.

<lj-cut text=""Interpol 9/21/07"">

I got there way way too early. Who knew Interpol fans don't line up? I got there at 3:30, late by my standards, and there were maybe 5 people in front of me. After about an hour, two people showed up behind me. Nobody else showed up until about 6 o clock, an hour before doors opened. If I had known that I wouldn't have had to get up so damn early, haha (5 hour drive!). But it was fun, I made a little group of friends and we talked about bands and concerts and favorite Interpol songs. Oh, this homeless guy came around with flowers, and he gave me one and was like, ""Oh yes, this a Red Indian paintbrush, blah blah blah"" and I'm like aww thank you. And then he goes, ""Got a dollar?"" and I'm like uhh no. ""Ok well I sell these."" and he took my flower away. HE TOOK MY FLOWER AWAY. Hahahaha. It was so funny.

The doors finally open, we all run in, but I do the same thing I do everytime I go to this place, I go the wrong freaking way. I run into this room and there's no one there yet and it doesn't really look familiar so I'm kind of confused. There's these two radio station guys and they're like, ""Hey, how many people are you here with?"" and I'm like uhh none...and they ask me...some other stuff, I can't remember, I'm still kind of looking around confusedly (is that a word?). SO finally I'm like, ""Is this where the show is?"" and they're like, ""oh, no, that's upstairs."" BSDGHDKSGHKSD. Thanks dudes, could've told me that. So I rush up there and thank god there was hardly people in there, it was like I never got lost in the first place haha. Most people were going to sit in the balcony, apparently. So I find my buddies and they muscle me in front them so I can see better (they were all a bunch of guys that were taller than me lol. not to mention i had been in front of them in line anyways). Well, in front of all of them except one, who says he'll squeeze me up to the rail later. He never does, haha. But it's cool, I was second row and had a great view. I was KICKING myself for not bringing my camera. I always forget how close the stage really is sometimes. Still mad at myself for that, especially after what happened after the show. WHICH YOU WILL SOON HERE OF SO SHH.

After waiting over an hour the (very late) opening band, Liars, comes on. I'd heard from some girls who'd already been to a few shows this tour that they sucked really, really bad.

So, they start playing (and the guitarist/backup drummer/backup singer is way hot, let me tell you) and everything sounds great. Amazing, actually. They focus on the drums alot and it sounds really damn cool. They did sound similar to Interpol. It was just really, really good.

...then the singer starts singing.

Not even singing actually. You can't call it that. He screams. No, not screaming like an emo band might do. Yelling. Shouting. Not even like The Hives might do, although you could obviously tell that was his inspiration (he came on stage dressed in an all white suit). He just...randomly shouted things at the crowd. ""AHHHHHHHEEEWOOOOOOOOHEHEHEAHHHHHHH!!!"" and many, many other strange sounds. Everytime he'd do something, everyone would jump (because it was always out of NOWHERE) and look around at each other like WTF. 

It had to be the most entertaining thing I have EVER seen, no joke.

He was a horrible dancer. He looked like he thought he was at an indian pow wow. He sang too close to the microphone, practically swallowing it, and it made things sound ten times worse. I feel really bad for the rest of the band, because they  were amazing and he ruined everything haha. His microphone went out at one point, probably due to all the slobber he was getting in it, and he kind of freaked out. He's stumbling around, trying to fix the thing, it's not working, so he grabs the hot guitarist's microphone, sings into that for a little while, realizes that the guitarist is supposed to sing too, so he throws his microphone back at him, stumbles around looking for another microphone, finds a new one on the floor, tries to rip it out of its packaging, its not working, hes tearing at with his teeth, he finally gets it open, has to set it up some way or something, but he finally gets it and FINALLY continues his yelling at the audience. Oh, it was gold.

So I have kind of mixed emotions on them. It was terrible, but also hilariously entertaining. And the funny thing is, their music is actually good. I listened to a few songs on Myspace and it's good stuff, he's just awful live I guess. Haha. 

So they're done, thank God, and then the real wait begins. I don't know how long we waited, but it seemed incredibly long. The roadies must've tested the instruments about 50 times each. My buddies and I talked about the opening band, said that if they could do it, we sure as hell could. So we're going to start a band, and I'm going to be the one who comes out, shouts something strange at the audience, and then runs backstage. I'll do that every few minutes. I'm gonna be great!

AND THEN FINALLY OMG THE LIGHTS GO DOWN AND HERE COMES CARLOS AND LOOK THERE'S SAM AND EEE DANIEL! Oh my god, Carlos is the hottest thing alive. He walks on stage like he owns the fucking place, SO straight and tall, all slow and with kind of a swagger, and he's in all black with this long trench coat with an upturned collar, looking like a vampire, in cowboy boots....holy fucking god he's my favorite person ever hahaha.

Paul comes on after everyone else, and oh dear he's adorable. His hair is combed down really flat, and he's got it tucked behind his ears. He's in all black, but he's got a little white sweater tied around his shoulders. He looked so clean and cute, hahaha. 

They open with Obstacle 1 and the rest is just history. It was such. an amazing. show. I'm still reeling from it.Everything sounded absolutely perfect. GAAAAAAAAHH.

Paul was his usual serious self at the beginning, but after awhile he got really smiley and it was adorable. I was like YAY PAUL LIKES US.

Daniel and his dancing...oh my god, epic. I love watching him. He was on the opposite side I was on, which is bummer because I could just watch his feet move all day. I don't even know how you would describe his dancing. It's just awesome, haha. At one point he RAN over to my side of the stage, played in front of us for about 5 seconds, and then RAN back to his side. Haha so cute.

As is the case with most drummers, Sam was almost invisible. :( But hey, he sounded great!

Carlos. CARLOSSSS. I just stared at him for about 90% of the show. The way he moves with that bass, he exudes confidence and coolness and omg. WHAT IS IT ABOUT CARLOS.  He was right in front of my section, and he'd come over to us and point the bass at us and nod his head at us and smile with this ""I know, I'm awesome"" look on his face. *dead*

This was the setlist in no particular order, including encore:

Obstacle 1
C'mere
Evil
Heinrich Maneuver
Pioneer to the Falls
Leif Erikson
Mammoth
Narc
No I in Threesome
Not Even Jail
NYC
Pace is the Trick
PDA
Rest My Chemistry
Say Hello to the Angels
Stella Was a Diver and She was Always Down
Slow Hands
Take You On a Cruise

They MAY have played Length of Love and Obstacle 2, for some reason I'm not sure. I kind of remember them but I kind of don't. I'm more certain on Length of Love than I am on Obstacle 2, though.

I had heard that they hadn't been playing Angels recently, and I was kind of dying when I heard that, because Angels is my favorite song EVER. So when I heard the opening chords...haha, my concert buddies knew I wanted to hear it so bad, so when they started it, they all turned and looked at me like :O and I'm like :O and then we just all rocked out. I was so thrilled. 

Slow Hands was maybe the best of the night. Not even sure why but after it was done, I could hear a bunch of people go, ""That was AWESOME."" haha. It was though. Fun fun fun.

Rest My Chemistry was SEEEEXYYYY. And so was Narc.

Was veeeery happy to hear Stella, seeing as I named my dog after it and all.

Take You on a Cruise was GORGEOUS, and No I in Threesome was tons of fun. Everything else....amazing, purely amazing.

I really wished they would've played The New, Roland, Who Do You Think?, and I would've keeled over if they'd played Lighthouse. So you know...for future reference 'Pol, play those. Also, Next Exit would've been enjoyable.

After it was over, Sam threw his drumsticks, Carlos threw his pick, and I got nothin'. Daniel stayed on stage the longest being a total ham. Waving, blowing kisses, bowing, shaking hands with the people in the front row (only on his side though, damnit). Aaahahah gotta love him.

I hadn't planned on waiting by the tour bus afterward, because I knew how long bands tend to make people wait and I just didn't feel like going through it. But after the show, I got to thinking, Interpol were the first band I ever saw live (3 years ago almost!), they should be the first band I meet too, so HELL YES I'm waiting by the bus! And I did.

Some lady says that Carlos already came out, got his dog off the bus, and ran back in. This is an amusing picture in my head. 

After only 20 minutes at the most...PAUL FUCKING BANKS. He runs past us all, saying, ""just a second, I'll be right back!"". I don't know where he went. But then he comes back, starts at my end of the line (thank god, otherwise I would have been there forever) and begins signing. He finally gets to me, and signs a shirt that my mother had bought for me earlier (so glad she did, I had nothing else that was signable lol). I told him thanks for playing Angels, he looked at me as I was saying it, but didn't say anything back lol. I looked down and realized he had signed my shirt in a silver pen, which didn't show up very well. So I'm like, ""Paulll.."" and he looks back at me. ""Can you sign it in black?"". And he comes back, signs it again in black, then continues down the line. He talks way too much. ;) Actually, when people said the show was awesome, he'd say thank you in the most SINCERE way I've ever heard someone say it. As if he was genuinely surprised people enjoyed the show. Like, ""Wow...wow, thank you!"" Except he didn't say wow, he just sounded like he should have. Haha. It was really cute.

The people around me and I are looking at his signature after he leaves, and....well it's pretty amusing. The guy next to me's looks like it says ""PIB"" and mine looks like ""RB"". So, we've changed his name to Raoul. Raoul Banks. I realized Raoul stole my pen, and I was like PAUL I NEED MY PEN BACK! but he was too far down the line to hear me. Guy next to me: ""Fuckin' Raoul!"" Ahh it was funny.

Not very long after Paul was gone (by the way, we have no idea where he went to. If he had gone to the bus or back into the building, we would have seen him. He just disappeared!), out comes Daniel and the keyboardist. When Dan gets closer to me, I go, ""Dan, Paul stole my pen."" He doesn't even look up and says, ""Did he really?"" Damn, you can't even look at me when you're talking to me? I know you do this every night, but come onnn. Oh well. ALTHOUGH, he made a point to give this girl's pen back that he used. I think I reached him on a subconscious level! Haha. He is the cutest signer ever. He's very slow about it, you'd really think he was doing some elaborate design or something. But no, he just does a D with a tail, looks a bit like sperm. When he was signing my shirt, he goes, ""I'm not very good at this..."" and everyone's like, ""It's a hard job man."" and Dan goes, ""I know...the pressure.."" He's too damn cute. I tell him he can't be much worse than Paul, and tell him he is now known as Raoul thanks to his sloppy signing. Dan doesn't get it.  After he was done signing my shirt, I told him how awesome I thought his dance moves were and that his feet were amazing to watch. He looks at me and then just laughs and moves on. Lolz.

So the keyboardist isn't far behind him, and I don't really know anything about him tbh, so I'm asking around for his name, and nobody else knows...BUT then some guy near to me introduces himself to him, and he replies, ""I'm Dave"". WOO. So I'm like DAVE, of course, HI DAVE. Oh, he was wonderful. Really nice guy, and he actually talked! He had these really cool rings on, and I told him so, and he went off about how they were from South America or something lol. I asked him if he was part of the band now, or just there to tour (which I already knew the answer to, but I needed some conversation material). He was like, ""Oh no, bands just hire me to play whatever instrument they need me to...I've played guitar for the Black Crowes!"" He sounded really proud of that and it was cute. He started talking about other bands he'd played with, but I can't remember any others. He talked about some other stuff, and eventually we're all like, ""So you gonna sign our stuff, or...?"" He looks down at our shirts and he's like, ""Oh, what's this!"" I go, ""Why, they're t-shirts!"" and he says, ""Ahh, I've heard about these."" Ahaha. AREN'T WE HILARIOUS. He has this really long signature. And really messy too. We were all trying to figure it out after he left, and we're pretty sure it says, ""xox F. Dave Keys '07"". So then we're all like, ""Wtf? F. Dave?"" and it's all highly amusing. I decided that it was like James Bond, so he is now known as Dave, F Dave.

Awhiiiiile after that, guess who comes running out. Gaius! I think that's it's name. CARLOS'S DOG! It's just running around wagging it's tail and being generally cute. Not far behind comes Carlos and Sam. Oh my god I'm so dying inside, IT'S CARLOS D. My experience with him is very sketchy in my mind, I can hardly remember it I was so thrilled. I know I told him he was my favorite band member and he smiled, and I think I told him how awesome his coat was, and I think I told him the stache was lookin' awesome (it actually does look better now that it's all trimmed up and not in his mouth anymore). The guy next to me asked me to take a picture of them together, and I did that....that's about all I remember. Damn. I was just OVERCOME. Ahahaha. Fangirl. Oh by the way, we had been using this box thingy as a table for signing, but then the roadies took it away (it was a box of guitars or something like that and they were loading stuff). So after that I had to use my hands as a table for them. So yeah. CARLOS D USED MY HANDS AS A TABLE! OMFG!!!!111!!!1212!~``!!

When Sam gets to me, he starts signing my shirt (ON MY HANDS OMFG). The pen isn't working. I look down..I had been looking at Sam, because I realized that, up close and with the short hair, he bore an astounding resemblance to Jack Bauer and this amused me. He's much better looking than Jack Bauer, though. AND I BET HE COULD SAVE THE WORLD FASTER THAN 24 HOURS AHAHAHHAAHAHHA. ahem. ANYWAY. I look down and I see that the cap is still on the pen and he's trying to sign like that. I'm like, ""Uh, you might want to take the cap off."" He kind of freezes for a couple seconds before taking the cap off. I'm like, ""It usually works better that way, but you never know. Could try it to other way, maybe start a trend."" and he's like, ""No..no, I've tried that before. It doesn't work."" Haha.

And basically that's it. I told Sam the show was amazing and thank you, said bye to my buddies, kicked myself for not having a camera, and left. Went to eat at a bar/restaurant where minors were not allowed but I got in anyway, LOLZ SO BAD. Went back to my uncle's place, slept (not really) on a recliner, woke up the next morning, went home. Fell asleep as soon as I got home, woke up this morning pretty late, then started writing this. :) And it's taken me a long time. But anyway that's that.

Oh, but here's some crappy camera phone pictures of the show. Mostly of Carlos, though. I didn't take pictures afterward because my camera phone is pure crap and I knew it'd screw any pics up. Actually, I DID take pics, not with the members, but of them, and my phone DID screw them up so I'm glad I didn't take any pictures of me with them because I would have been really disappointed. Wow. Long sentence.

I wrote this review awhile ago, and it was actually sent in a message to a friend, so its not going to sound very ""journalish"" lol. But I so don't feel like rewriting it. I sound like a spaz in this though. Sorry. Also, it's very out of order.

it was AWESOME. omg, the crowd was insane. like...just as insane as you'd expect used fans to be, but times ten. there were girls fainting, and the guards had to pull sooo many people out...this one girl was like crying her EYES out, i dont know what happened but i think she got seriously hurt. but i personally wasn't in too much pain so it was like a really freaking fun kind of insane show. ahhh man. i've found something that works when people start getting rough though. just act even crazier than they are. they back off. GOD SO FUN. omg i got so many elbows in my face though. and this one girl brought her arm down really hard on my shoulder. PAIN. and at one point people were trying to make more room so they were all pushing HARD to one side, which happened to be my side. they did it slowly though so i didnt realize what was happening, i just now its steadily getting more difficult to breathe. it was freaky.. thought i was going to pop or something.

waiting in line was badddd....like 95 degrees out there, yuck. and time went by so slowww. there was this guy with a killers shirt on, so when he walked past i was like ""killers are awesome!"" and he turned and looked at me...and just kind of stared for a second or two...and says, ""i'm only wearing it because it says killers on it."" (DAMN EMOS) i was embarassed.

OMFG I ALMOST GOT MY CAMERA TAKEN AWAY. okay i didn't know they didnt allow cameras. they didnt allow them last time i was there but i didnt know if it'd be the same this time, and i never really believed they could actually take your camera away from you anyway, so i just brought it. but then i get worried, so i take out the batteries and make kurtis hold on to them, so i can just say yeah i have my camera but i threw the batteries away. so i get up to the bag checker lady and she...omg. BITCH. shes like you can't take this in. i'm like i threw the batteries away.
doesnt matter, you cant take it in.
i dont have a car to put it in, maam.
well, you can either leave it on this table and hope its here when you get out, or you have to throw it in the trash.
are you crazy? this is a 300 dollar camera, im not getting it stolen and i sure as hell am not throwing it in the fucking trash.
well, you cant take it in.
there isnt a person i can give it to to hold on to it for me?
no.
are you serious. theres no room or anything i can leave it in.
NO.
(and im seriously close to tears at this point because my camera is my freaking life)
okay FINE ill leave it on the table and HOPE it stays there then. * glares*
(so i put it on the table, and then quickly run back and grab it when shes not looking. the guys around me are like ""run, run!"" well, fucking ticket checker doesnt let me in fast enough and she catches me. fucking grabs my shoulder and whips me around.)
I'M NOT FUCKING LEAVING MY CAMERA.
okay, i have to find the police then. (!!!!)
(so she starts pulling me along with her, when this WONDROUS LITTLE OLD LADY staff person comes up.)
whats the problem?
(i look at the old lady with my best puppy face and whore bitch face tells her about me and evil camera sneaking ways.)
well, she can go check her camera in at the desk. we can hold it for her.
FINE, you got this taken care of, take her away. (and she storms off)
(so little old lady takes me, i passed kurtis as i went in and gave him a angry/sad face and hes like wtfff!, and she takes me to another lady who gives me a ticket to hold on so that i can reclaim my camera, and she tells me i need to check before the show if cameras are allowed, blah blah blah. and im just like OMG THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU, im still near tears, shaking like a leaf.)
well, i just cant stand it, im too nice and you look so sad.

omg that lady is my best best best friend. i want to  kill whore bitch face lady over there. ARRRRGHGHGHGH. excuse my language!

then kurtis makes fun of me for almost crying.

ANYWAY. 

i met the first opening band! haha well two of the members anyway. they were walking around beforehand passing out stickers and i struck up a little conversation. i told them they better not suck. and they DIDN'T. okay i couldn't actually hear the music too well, but the performance, wow. they had two singers and their energy was insaneeee!! (and they were hot) one of them actually did a freaking back flip. it was goooood. and the other one came and walked in front of the barrier after their set, touching hands and talking to people and stuff. aww i love the friendly bands.

the next band, the bled...i kind of hate them. saw them at projekt rev and they did nothing but scream. i don't mind screaming, but seriously you HAVE TO SING TOO. gah. they played their instruments really well though. and since it was all screaming, of course the crowd went CRAAAZY. whoa. this one girl next to me was psychotic, and she was all elbows. ow.

the used were pretty good. the bird and the worm? they only played fucking half of it. i was SO mad. it's my favorite. and it's like a HUGE song right now, right? wtffff. oh well. and they opened with it too. that's the kind of song you save for last. pssssh retards.

oh its funny though, bert the singer, he uh...he spits alot (hes nasty ). and he spat right in this chicks face. i dont know if he meant to but POW right in her eye. awesome. he laughed.

oh and i'm not sure what was going on, but...i'm gueeesing that some guy hit this chick, probably on purpose (it is a concert after all) and bert...i dont know, saw something going on and went over there and was like, ""whoa whoa what's going on over here?"" and i guess the chick told him he hit her and the guy denied it...and bert goes, ""i'll tell you what dude, if you really did just hit a girl, then FUCK YOU."" and he sounded so pissed off. i love when guys are all protective of girls, even if they're guys as nasty as bert.

and then he said, ""you know, i think ladies are CRAZY"" and he did the little finger spinny thingy on the side of his head and mouthed ""loocooo"". and then he says, ""but you have two clumps of fat on your chest. with a little pointy nipple in the middle. you know what nipples are for? feeding babies. that's right. ladies, ill be your baby tonight.""

it's so GROSS but so hilarious at the same time, you know?

and they half-covered loser by beck! i LOVE that song ah it was great.

*thinks* um um um...OH. after the bled (yes i'm out of order here) there was a shoe left on the stage...from the band or thrown up there, i dont know...but anyway the stage cleaner uppers were up there, and this one guy kicks the shoe to the edge of the stage...and it's like right in front of me because i'm second row...AND THEN HE COMES UP AND KICKS IT AGAIN LIKE ITS A FREAKING FOOTBALL AND IT LANDS RIGHT IN MY FACE. oh my god. it's so funny now but it HURT. i always get stuff like that happening to me! drumstick in the eye, shoe in the face...what the hell. and there were so many crowd surfers, i hardly even had time to watch the band....this one girls foot landed in my face and her shoe was wet and dirty ewww.

*thinks* uhh afterward we were walking to whataburger, and theres this guy ive kind of had my eye on for most of the show...hot. and theres a bunch of other people walking with us too (not WITH us but you know) and he's one of them...and he starts asking everyone where they're going and when everyone says whataburger he's like, ""YEAH! We're going to WHATABURGER! COME ON GUYS!"" and i'm at the front of this little procession and he runs up to me, asks me where i'm going, i say wb, he's like WOOOO! and gives me a high five. and then he made the entire group run to whataburger with him. i can't imagine how retarded we looked.

so once we get to whataburger, i go to the girls bathroom to fix my makeup (MESS) and theres 3 other girls in there doing the same, and he barges in and all the girls scream and he's like, ""This isn't where I parked my car!"" and leaves.

and theeen after we ate, and i'm waiting for mom, and i'm waiting for kurtis to get out of the bathroom, hot guy looks over and sees me sitting by myself and is like, ""hey! why are you by yourself? *pats empty seat next to him*"" and i just tell him kurtis is in the bathroom. he pats the seat again. and im like noo, my rides almost here i gotta go as soon as hes out of the bathroom.so he's like oookay and turns around. then like 2 seconds later he turns back to me and gives me this huge cheesy grin and a ""shy"" little wave (in quotations because he was deeefinitely not actually shy, just made the wave look all cute ) and he kept doing that like 3 times (and i did it back to him of cooourse). SO CUTE. then kurtis came out and mom got there and BLAH. i wish i'd gone and sat next to him. if only for a second. could've gotten a myspace maybe. HE WAS HOT.

and...well thats about it. i got home, gave kurtis a big big hug for waiting in line with me (even though he ditched me in the middle of the show, forgot to mention that...he wanted to try to get to the middle of the crowd (which is dumb, we had a perfectly good spot on the side) but i didnt want to risk losing my good spot and getting a crappy one so he just went without me. ASS.) and now here i am.

wow. goooooood night.

Hahahaa. Rereading that, I sound retarded. But it's cool, whatever. END.

<lj-cut text=""Projekt Revolution 8/11/07"">

I also wrote this a long time ago and never put it up, so it might also sound a little stange at parts. Or maybe not.


Went to Projekt Revolution about..oh 2 weeks ago (definitely longer than that now, see how long ago I wrote this?). Mannnn, oodles and oodles of fun. I was sooooooooooooo far away and I was by myself (aside from the strangers you always meet at concerts) but it was just awesome.

It was UNBELIEVABLY HOT outside. It had to be at least 100 degrees, or at least the heat index was that high. I wanted to be all fashionable so I had jeans and BOOTS on. Bad idea. Bad, bad idea. I was buuuurning up. Thankfully I wore a thin strappy tank top though so it could've been worse. But yeah. I don't sweat very easily, and my shirt was completely soaked with the stuff within a couple hours. Soooo bad. And I could barely breath. AH. It was awful.

 They had two stages, a little one and then the huge main stage. The little one was up first. Madina Lake was supposed to play first, but they weren't there. :( I knew that before the show but I'd forgotten so I was really bummed. I like them. So, Styles of Beyond were on first. They were like...hip hop. Which is weird, looking at all the other bands that were there. They were okay. Not my type. They did sample an Arctic Monkey's song though. I think I was the only one there who actually knew they were sampling it haha. I left during them to go get a couple bottles of water. I chugged the first one in about 30 seconds. SOOO HOT.

This guy asked me if I could put sunblock on his back. I don't think he was trying to pick me up, but I was like HELLLLLL NO. And then he left and I felt bad. He probably has a burnt back now.

The was The Bled. Not good. All screaming. I like at least a little singing mixed in there, geez. The singer was funny though. I can't remember anything he said, but I do remember laughing. OH I remember this one song they had that went something like ""Pizza and burriiiiitos, we want pizza and burriiiitos!""...seriously. Really weird.

Thennnn was Saosin! Yaaaaay Saosin! The music was too loud though and you couldn't hear Cove singing very well. :( Very good, nonetheless. Better the first time I saw them, but still. Very gooooood. <3

And THEN was Mindless Self Indulgence. Ahhh mannnn, I LOVE THEM! I was so excited to see them and they did NOT disappoint. Jimmy is the funniest guy ever. EVER. And I love his dancing. It was just an awesome set. Especially Stupid MF, oh god I love that song.

Okay, so about 50 feet from the stage, there's a small white tent with all the sound equipment in it. There's a barrier around this tent, and I'm leaning on it. So, not too far into MSI's set, the guy next to me leans over and whispers,""MCR guys behind us"". I wasn't even sure what he was talking about at first, but then it registered. I slowly turn around and there, standing under the tent, sipping a drink through a straw and singing along to MSI, maybe ten feet from me at most is GERARD FUCKING WAY. AND RAY OMG TORO. I am screaming like a fangirl inside. I wave at them but they either didn't see me or ignored me. Let me tell you, Gerard Way sucking on a straw and lip synching to MSI is maybe one of the cutest things I have ever seen. He is a cute straw sucker. His mouth looks cute. I know, I'm weird. Anyway so I snapped a quick picture, and alot of people kept coming up and taking their own pictures. It was wonderful. I kept glancing back every few minutes. He stayed for the whole set.

<img src=""http://img166.imageshack.us/img166/4414/img2888cs9.jpg"">
I'm so good at taking unnattractive pictures of people.

Buttt yeah so MSI were awesome. Except, toward what I thought was the end, I was absolutely dying from the heat so I HAD to go get something to drink. As I was standing in line, I heard them playing Straight to Video, which is my faaavorite song. :( I didn't think they'd play it so I thought I could leave! Uggh. And I didn't get back in time, of course. Their set was over after that. :( Blaaah, so then everyone starts moving to the main stage.

Anyway so I take my newly acquired Mountain Dew and two bottles of water up the stairs. This was difficult. I was sweating like a pig, my feet and legs hurt, and I was trying to carry my purse, my umbrella, and three bottles. Thankfully the line was moving slowly so I wasn't holding anyone up haha. So when i get up the stairs...hooly cow this place was alot bigger than I was expecting. I had a lawn ticket (unfortunately!) so I made my way up there, found me a spot, and plopped on down. I was so far from the stage. Bummer, major bummer. I was also overheating so I took one of my water bottles and poured it all over myself. COLD WATER HAS NEVER FELT SO GOOD. The sun started going behind the clouds most of the time I was up there, so that was really good.

This bunch of guys sat down next to me. They said I had a lovely umbrella. My umbrella is just black. Okay. They asked me how old I was. I said 18 and one said, ""That is SUCH a likely answer."" so I was like, ""FINE, I'm 17 but almost 18."" I'm actually not 18 until June. But I hate telling guys I'm 17 because then they kind of shun me for the rest of the show because I'm jail bait or something. Not that I was at all interested in these guys, they were like 30 years old. But I didn't want to be friendless all day. Then one guy said I was hot but ""no forthcoming comments about that considering your age"". SEE. SHUN. Haha. And on the other side of me were a couple of chicks who are stoned out of their mind. At least one of them was. It was hilarious. She was telling me about rubber and lightning and Ville Valo's small teeth and all sorts of ""deep"" things. 

Not much time passes before Julien-K hits the stage. They were alright. Love their music, but the performance wasn't real memorable. And the singer was gross and shirtless and made alot of sex faces which was ew.

PLACEBO. LOVE. LOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVE. <3333 They were GREAT. I wish I could have been closer. Brian looks f$@%9$(*Yfdwg HOT. His hair is niiiice and grown out and not bald anymore and he was wearing his pretty makeup and oh he looked like his old self and just segskhttoiggggxgx OOOOH BABY. Uh but yeah. The performance itself was really amazing too. Especially Pure Morning which I wish I had recorded. I just wish they had played Space Monkey. Oh but they did play Nancy Boy, which I recorded! That's one of the first songs of theirs I ever heard and it's still a favorite. Soo didn't think they'd play it so I was HAPPY. Yaaay.

HIM. I don't like HIM. So I did not enjoy HIM. Poo on HIM. Ville Valo looks even rougher than usual.

TAKING BACK SUNDAY! Weeeee. Okay, they were great. But they weren't amazing. But, still very enjoyable. I think it would have been a better show if I had been up close. I mean, everything's better up close but I think this reeeeally would have been. I love the way Adam performs and you can't really tell how awesome he does when the camera man you're relying on sticks to headshots. Oh, and Adam looks gross. Please cut your hair, boy. :( Oh and he broke into Amy Winehouse in between songs. They try to make me goooo to rehab but I said nooo no.

Okay so then the stage starts getting set up for MCR, and I'm so excited. They've got a really cool new (to me) backdrop with wolves on it. Anyway anyway anyway they finally come on, oh god it's purely amazing. Gerard. Is. BEAUTIFUL. I'M SORRY I'M FANGIRLING SO MUCH OVER HIM BUT HE LOOKED SO PRETTY. He had a new uniform. Or maybe they? I think it was just him wearing it, though. Anyway, the jacket was similar to the old Black Parade jacket, but...different. And he had a sheriff's star. ISN'T HE CUTE. The camera man pretty much stayed on Gerard on the whole time, which is kind of sad because Frank is my BOY. But, the brief flashes there were of him were filled with sexy. AND GET THIS PEOPLE. BOY LOVE. FRERARD BOY LOVE. LOTS OF IT. *faints* Frank is one affectionate boy. He comes up to Gerard, rocking away on his guitar, puts his head on his shoulder, rubs his face on him, oh god it's so sweet. AND THEN. 

FRANK. LICKS. GERARD.

Not  a quick lick. Oh no. This was a long, wet, ""WE ARE TOTALLY SECRET LOVERS"" lick.

And I recorded it. I RECORDED IT. I couldnt believe that it happened when I had the camera going haha. I kind of went crazy.

Frank rubbed on Gerard many other times, but that was the only one I got on film. There was another where he was rubbing his head on Gerard's thigh, dangerously close to the crotchal area. I swear every girl there was dying.  

Frank is a wonderful performer though. He bites the microphone, he hits it against his head, he rolls on the floor, and he loves all over Gerard. I don't even think he does it on purpose either. He seems like he gets so into the music that he just goes crazy and doesnt know what he's doing. It's kind of like how you dance and sing like a fool at a concert even though you know you look awful, and maybe you're embarassed when you think back on it, but at that moment you just can't help it. I think that's how it is with Frank. AND WE LOVE HIM FOR IT DON'T WE.

Gerard came up to Mikey once, put his arm around him and was running his hand through his hair.. It was the cutest thing, and Mikey had this big smile which was also cute, but then the smile turned into this very orgasmic face which was kind of weird since they're brothers, but then it was really hot, but then it was creepy?

When they did Cancer (or I should say when Gerard did it, since it's basically just him singing it now), Gerard layed down on the floor and took this...big banner thing that had gotten thrown on stage, and wrapped it around him like a blanket and sung Cancer like that. It was so cute. And so fitting.

He started giving this little speech, making us cheer for all the bands on the bill. When he got to Taking Back Sunday, he said they were his best friends in the whole world. THAT MADE ME SO HAPPY.

Ummm I can't think of anything else except it was awesome awesome awesome. And I can't figure out why they don't play Ghost of You at shows. I miss it.


So by this point it's been raining for awhile. It was great really, cooled things down. I was actually kind of cold lol. But eventually it got a little more serious and started thundering and lightning. Still, I didn't think it was too bad. But then this guy gets up on stage and starts talking about the storm, saying that everyone on the lawn needs to go and WAIT IN THEIR CARS UNTIL THE STORM IS OVER. That they'll announce on the radio when it's safe for us to come back. It's nice that they want us to be safe, but are you kidding me? We're going to LEAVE right before the biggest band of the night? Helllll no. I didn't actually have a car to go to anyway haha. BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. So...a few people actually do leave, presumably not Linkin Park fans, but the majority just started booing. Now even though I'm definitely not going to leave, I was still kind of freaked out that the storm was supposedly serious enough to actually tell people to leave. Standing out there in the open, with my little umbrella aka lightning rod, I felt a little uncomfortable. So...there's this big pavillion thing that all the seats are under, the real seats, and also the pit and the stage. There's a slight overhang of the roof, so I go and stand under that. The guards won't actually let anyone past that, because you have to pay for those seats. So I'm safe from lightning then, but I can't see a THING of the stage, and I can't even see the TV screen. So I'm trying to figure out what to do....I really don't want to go get struck by lightning but damn, I wanted to see Linkin Park bad. Sooo I decide to stand under there until the band comes on and just risk electrocution. :) The band was taking a LONG time to come on though, and I got pretty antsy so eventually I just said screw it and went back up to the lawn to watch them setting up the stage. GUESS WHAT I DIDN'T GET STRUCK BY LIGHTNING. It was sure pouring though and I was soaked because I definitely didn't want to stick my umbrella up in the air. But that's cool. I'M ALIVE!

Linkin Park were amazing. Seriously. Unbelievable. Nothing else to it but that. :) I didn't know all of the songs, not even most of them, only the singles, but stillllll it was an awesome time.

I didn't think there was going to be an encore so I left. Then I heard them start playing again so I had to run back haha. They drew Bleed it Out out to like 7 minutes, and then did this amazing drum solo afterward for like 5 minutes. It was the best song of the night, and I could killll myself for not recording it.

They gave this long ass speech about how we were the best crowd on the tour so far. Man I love when they do that. Even though I know they weren't talking about me because I was lawn and lawn sucks.

So that was a way fun show, definitely. Heres a few videos I took (INCLUDING FRERARD LOVE OMG). They aren't the best, I was very far away so theyre really just of the screen. The audio isn't too bad, but not perfect. people around me wouldnt stop talking. But whatever, if you want 'em here they are. :)

And omg, here's the best thing ever. Gerard goes up to this security guard and starts singing in his face. The guard just stands there staring for a few seconds, before he starts ROCKING OUT WITH GERARD. You've got to watch this shit. It's even better with the music playing, haha.

seeing the used on september 8th. i don't really want to. but i'm going anyway because if i don't something really awesome will happen and i'll regret not going. :] plus it's a free concert so why not.

i'm moving to germany next year. my step dad is in the air force and he's getting relocated or whatever you call it. i don't really have any other options so i'm just going to go with my mom and him. kind of cool? i'm not sure what i think about it yet. it's so FAR. :[  anyway so we're gonna have to sell the house, so my mom is preparing for that. packing up a bunch of junk, and she's going to let me put on a garage sale with it all, and i get to keep the money from it. yay!

i really don't feel like writing this, but my internet is down at the moment and i have nothing better to do haha. anyway. definitely one of the best concerts i've ever been to.

i got there about 1, with doors to open at 6:30. made fast friends with the boy in front of me, which kept me nice and entertained for the majority of the time. also made friends with about 5 other people, so we had a great little group and we all had a blast before the doors were even open, haha. about an hour before that, some guy came out and told us that the band were not allowing cameras. i think that is bullshit, personally, because there's no reason nice guys like mcr and muse would refuse pictures, especially after allowing them at every other show. i think the venue people didn't want pictures. i don't know why. BUT THAT'S WHAT I THINK OK. so, one of the girls i was hanging out with let me put my camera in her car (this was not an easy decision.). i'm still so bummed about that and i'm sorry i have no (good) pictures to post. :(

so the doors finally open, and this was HELL. they had us split into 4 lines, two with boys and two with girls. they had people patting us down, which is why they had to split us all up, so that they could have female security patting down the girls, males patting down the boys and all that. but anyway, yeah 4 lines, and then when we get right up to the door, they suddenly want just 2 lines. and how are we supposed to that? everyone was trying to push into the same line, people who had been there for only a few hours cutting in front of people who had been there all day. possibly the most aggravating thing i've ever been through.  i saw people who were WAY behind me a minute ago, now 5 or 6 people in front of me. UGH. buuuuut fortunately, even with all that, i still ended up with a completely awesome spot, with my little group of people. 2 people back! left side! FRANKIE'S SIDE! omg!

i swear the wait for muse to come on felt like days. no concert wait has ever been so excruciating, i was so excited. i killed most of that time telling my group of people how awesome muse were going to be, and how blown away they'd all be. they were just like, ""yeeeah. suuure."" a couple of them knew a song or two, but none of them were really big fans like meeeee. omg seriously i was shaking i was so excited for them. FAVORITE LIVE BAND EVER.

so, finally, FINALLY the lights go down. the people scream. blue red purple pink green lights come on, and you see the silhouettes of 3 men come on stage. i'm rabid by this point.

i can't remember what they opened with, or the order of any of the songs, all i remember is it was mind-blowing. i was the only person i could see jumping around like an idiot and screaming/singing at the top of my lungs and even though that sucked i couldn't have cared less. i couldn't believe they were the OPENING act, and yet still put on a performance as amazing as this. the thing i had worried about from the moment i heard they were opening was the light show. i really think the lights at muse concerts MAKE the show. they're always so perfect, and i was scared they'd tone them down alot since they were only opening. but praaaaise the lord they were beautiful this time. it was (almost) exactly like when i had seen them do their own show. nothing less than incredible. it took a little while for the crowd to get into it, but by the time they were done people were screaming for them as if they had just seen mcr. i was so proud. one of my group peoples said, ""you proved me totally wrong. that was amazing."" and i told him he was going to go out and buy every album now, and he agreed. score.

this was their setlist, in no order:

Starlight
Supermassive Black Hole
Map of the Problematique
Knights of Cydonia
City of Delusion
Time is Running Out
Hysteria (THANK GOD!!!! FUNNEST SONG AT A CONCERT EVERRRRR!)
Stockholm Syndrome

ahh god i know i'm forgetting at least a few songs, but i can't for the life of me figure out what they are. damn. sorry.

they played a different instrumental break between each song, and that was cool. at one point matt needed to tune his guitar, so while he did that (took a few minutes), they had some spacey, techno-y, robotic sounding music (you know, muse style) come over the speakers and dom drummed over it haha. it was cute.

so pretty much, still the best live band i've ever seen. amazing bassist, best drummer i've ever seen, and the most incredible guitarist/singer in the WORLD. seriously, i LOVE watching that man play. his fingers are just a freaking blur.

i was sad when they were finished, but i knew i was just that much closer to mcr and that was an awesome feeling. god, you could FEEL the tension in the air. and i don't usually say things that corny, haha.

after about half an hour, the lights go down again. screamscreamscream blahblahblah, you know how it goes. i look to the stage and see somebody wheeling a stretcher around the curtain. i'd heard about this, so i knew that it was gerard on the stretcher. and i'm just kind of...""oh my god. it's gerard way."" haha i was too shocked to do anything else. the opening ""beeep, beeep""s of the end (geez, what are those called??) start playing and gerard slowly rises from the stretcher. it was really kind of creepy lol. he's up there singing by himself until the part of the song where the rest of the music kicks in right after he says ""i expect you won't cry"", and right at that instant the curtain whips back and HOLY SHIT IT'S MCR. HOLY SHIT THERE'S FRANK RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. they had a backdrop of a mansion or haunted house looking thingy and that's all i really remember about the stage. 

at the end of the second or third song (again i don't remember the order of what they played), confetti just explodes from the ceiling. IT WAS SO AWESOME. i've never been to a show with things like that, and i wasn't expecting mcr to have it. it was amazing looking up at it all. it was all over me, all in my hair, all over the floor, all over the stage, and it was BEAUTIFUL. i grabbed a handful of it from the air and saved it. for some reason, i can only find one piece now. but at least i have it!

oh, but that wasn't all. it got better! FIRE!!! they had fire machine thingies on the stage and they were exploding all over the place the whole time and zomggg!!! fireworkssss yaaaay! that was an even bigger surprise for me. i could feel the fire on my face and it was fabulous.

so, i'm not very good at remember things from concerts. no, i remember things, but i don't remember when they happened. so i'm just going to post a bunch of random things i remember:

gerard dances like a fool. it's awesome. he also likes to swing his hips around when he walks and it's rather cute, though gay.
frank is the sexiest thing i've ever seen.
mikey wasn't there. i now know that he had decided to take his honeymoon with alicia, and i had somehow managed to catch the first show he wasn't at. just my luck.
mikey's replacement, who i now know to be matt cortez, was almost as sexy as frank, and because of that i was able to deal with mikey's absence.
gerard is chubbier than i thought and it's cute.
gerard was wearing eyeliner, and probably the white face powder. first time i've seen him in makeup in ages, and i love it.
gerard said his favorite muse song is stockholm syndrome. he also said muse are the nicest guys you could ever meet, and very humble. aw.

crap i can't remember much else. that's what i get for waiting so long to write this. :(

it was amazing though. they're so good live. that's all i can really say. 

setlist was all of the black parade + helena, give em hell kid, and i'm not okay for the encore (...there may have been one other song from revenge, but i'm pretty sure that was it). i'm surprised and kind of bummed they didn't do ghost of you. i mean it was a single. they usually play all the singles. COME ONNNN.

mama was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo FUN. i love that song. house of wolves, cancer, and the sharpest lives get honorable mentions. cancer nearly had me in tears. so pretty. teenagers was also pretty funny, what with 90% of the place being filled with teenagers. and famous last words was pretty great too, they had more fire in that song than any other (naturally).

after the show but before the encore, they played blood over the speakers and it was the biggest and funniest singalong ever ahahaaha.

when they drew back the curtain for the encore, oh god i wanted to cry. they had changed the backdrop to the circle-guns logo with ""revenge"" written in the middle. they'd taken off their black parade uniforms and had changed into revenge-era clothes, jeans, leather jackets, band shirts, things like that. it was like seeing the band i had originally fallen in love with and it was a beautiful thing.

so, i said i didn't get any good pictures. BUT I GOT CAMERA PHONE PICTURES! haha, they're mostly for my own benefit a sentimental thing you know, but i'll post them anyway. i don't know why they're all in different sizes.

haha crappiest animation ever. if you cant tell, he spins the guitar and then rocks out. woo.



so YES fabulous fabulous concert, everybody go see them.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""the killers!"">

i didn't make friends in line this time, so the 4 hour wait was AWFUL. but i only had 8 people in front of me in line, which is...amazing.

when they finally opened the doors, security was suck and everybody pretty much stampeded in. with my spot in line, i should've been guaranteed a spot right on the rail. instead i was 3 people back. thats frustrating, but still not a bad spot. in the center!

more awful waiting with no friends. :(

howling bells! they were so sexyyyyy. like...in an interpol-y way. kind of melodramatic-y music with a female singer who was hot. girls on guitar ftw. great light show too. and i have a crush on the other guitarist. just so you know.

ronnie came out and played tambourine with them for the last song and it was pretty lol.

the rapture! holy CRAP aside from muse, best opening band i've ever seen. OMG COWBELL IN LIKE EVERY SONG. the music is so so so so so uppity, and with the cowbell it felt like an african tribal dance or something....in a good way. amazing vocalists. amazing EVERYTHING, i LOVED them. dude, they have a song called ""Whoo! Alright! Yeah! Uh huh!"". enough said.

the rapture finished, and the stage preperation for the killers began. they put up this huge, huge white screen between the stage and the audience, so you couldn't see anything that was going on behind it. i was a little confused about that, i didn't realize the screen actually served a purpose.

AND WHAT A GRAND PURPOSE IT WAS. the ugly lights go down, the pretty lights come on, and theres suddenly a bunch of pictures playing on the white screen. pictures of vegas, sam's town, the album cover, things like that, all in black and white, with some sort of music playing (can't remember what). now, as close as i was to the stage, this screen is TOWERING over me, it was just so huge. so um yeah it was pretty freaking cool to see all of that in mega siiize.

you can't see what's going on behind the screen at this point, the pictures cover everything up. but then there's this really brief moment where there wasn't a picture on the screen, just a split second. but it was enough for everybody to see that the band was there, and they start screaming (the audience, not the band). then the lights go on the screen in a way that makes it this really pretty see-through blue color, and you see brandon hop up on a crate and start doing all those weird things he does. his strange dances, bowing, flailing his hands around....haha behind brandon. then WHOOSH the screen whips away, sam's town starts playing, the killersthekillersthekillers!!!!! oh my god so beautiful. everything. i was probably crying already. i know i cried at least a few times during the show.

i'd seen the killers 3 times before this, but this was the first time i'd seen them doing their own show, and not at a festival. also, the first two times i'd seen them they were still a relatively new band, still learning. the third time, brandon was sick. this time, they were all at the top of their game, and let me tell you, the difference was amazing. i was under the impression that the killers were simply ""good"" live. i now know that they are FUCKING AMAZING. i can't say that enough. brandon has so much more energy than i ever thought, and honestly he's a pretty good dancer haha. to be honest he's the only one i noticed a difference in. dave mark and ronnie have always been wonderful live i think, it's brandon i always thought was a bit lacking. and obviously his performance affects the show in a big way. so um yeah seeing him...uh...being amazing lol, absolutely made this the best killers show i've ever seen.

setlist in no order including encore:

all these things that i've done
on top
somebody told me
SHADOW-FUCKING-PLAY!! i was so thrilled to hear this live! it's AMAZING, really. brandon's dancing to it is A+. it's like branbot II. (i tried to record it but as luck would have it, he stopped as soon as i got my camera phone out.) and the guitar, oh beautiful. and brandon's hoo hoo hoos, AWESOME. my favorite of the night, i think. the lights during this were really kind of chaotic and it was perfect.


random things i remember:
dave getting up on a crate and rocking out, brandon getting up there next to him and pulling dave's head to his chest, stroking his face and his hair. AWWWW. haha, dave laughing and pulling away.

brandon: ""you know my sister used to be married to a man named orlando."" my sister thought he said, ""i used to be married to a man named orlando.""

dave running after brandon, brandon running away.

brandon nearly falling off the crate he was standing on. seriously he's done that at every show i've been to, he should probably be careful.

SO MUCH CONFETTI! GOLD, SPARKLY, PRETTY CONFETTI! they probably spit some out of the ceiling for every song. seriously there was a ton, it was so gorgeous. i caught some of that too!

i got flowers! not the ones ronnie threw, but some that the stage people threw when they were cleaning up. YAAY.

ronnie tried throwing his towel to the audience, but it didn't go quite far enough and ended up just between the railing and the stage. he did not look happy with that. later on he tried to throw his drumstick but it ended up hitting the sam's town banner and going right back to him. ahaha.

i've got such a terrible memory. :)

picturesss.

um let's see. i had a job for a week. working for my sister doing retail stuff. but i was just kind of temporary while they needed some help. i don't think she wants me until summer now. kind of sad. i was making good money. but i live in florida. summer is always just around the corner.

i still haven't gotten my permit! what a loser. i did take the test online though. i just have to go down to the dmv and take a hearing and vision test, get my picture taken and the card made lalala. when i'll get around to that, who knows.

hmm...life is boring. muse + mcr are coming up in less than a month and i cannot even tell you how excited i am (uh...i'm excited for killers too. just. muse are my favorite live band. and i haven't seen mcr before. so naturally i'm a little more giddy about them.). i just can't! bah, concerts are the only things i have to look forward to these days. i need a liiiiife. give me one?

"event","<lj-cut text=""TASTE OF CHAOS WAS AMAZING""> Really! EMO SHOWS RULE. I don't care what everyone else says. These bands put on amazing shows even when their music sucks. 

I wanted to get there at 12, we got there at 1. It didn't end up making much of a difference because people didn't really start coming until around 3. Yay! So Kurtis and I (he's my next door neighbor. I bought him a ticket for Christmas.) walked to Whataburger, ate, came back, still no more people, didn't lose our spot in line, hooray hooray. Then we took turns walking to the gas station to go pee. Yeah it was a really boring wait but I'm so glad I wasn't alone (he wasn't originally going to wait in line with me, but changed his mind because he is awesome).

A few of Kurtis' friends show up, and then the doors finally open and we all go in together. Had a pretty good spot, 5 people or so back. But some time during the first band I managed to get to 3 people back. I had lost Kurtis and his friends by then and would not see them again until after the show. Booo. But anyway, Terrific Kid was the first band. They're local and quite awesome. I'm surprised we actually have decent local bands. Really awesome performance, and the singer's voice is gorgeous.

Evaline was on after them (and I mean right after, there was no 15 minute break between bands like there usually is. One would leave and another would come. Love it.). SO GOOD. The singer played the cello! It was cool because he was rocking out pretty hard, while PLAYING THE CELLO. I mean really how hardcore is THAT. He was crazy. Jumping everywhere and spinning around and stuff. He kept jumping on the keyboard and it would wobble like crazy every time. I still don't know how he managed to stay on. And then he'd jump off at the perfect moment. Like he'd land just as a cymbal crashed. He had flawless timing. They were wonderfullll.

Aiden was on next. I was really nervous about them. All I knew about them was that their music was pretty hardcore, and they were scary looking. But they turned out to be SUPER FREAKING AWESOME. Oh maaaaan good show. Also the craziest show though. They did this thing where they parted the audience right down the middle. The singer got up there and is like, ""I need a 20 foot space between you guys. I'm serious. Move over."" I don't know how it was even possible, because people were sooo crammed in there already, but he did it. We had two different sides with a 20 foot space between them. And he's like, ""Do you know what we're doing here? Yeah, some of you do. As soon as this next song starts...I want you all to just RUN at each other and tear each other up."" And that's exactly what we did. The song starts and BAM both sides just run right smack into each other and start moshing the hell out of things. I was like right in the middle hahaha. It was painful, really painful, but fun as hell. I lost my shoes (still don't know how I got them back) and almost ripped the strap off of my purse (and ended up smashing my sunglasses to bits, which were in said purse). I loved it haha. During one song, the singer flipped off a security guard for some reason. After the song he was like, ""I'm sorry for flipping you off sir, but these kids are here to have fun tonight, let's not hassle them."" And of course the whole audience just loved him for that. Later on he started talking about how the security guards have a hard job, and they're probably all great guys, and let's give them a round of applause blah blah blah. The guards didn't even look at him haha. Yeah I liked that guy though. He was a freak, and he spit alot, but he was awesome. At one point he said something along the lines of, ""Look around at the people next to you. Put your arms around them. I don't care if they're complete strangers, just do it! These are the people you work with, the people you will grow old with. We're all a family here."" and he went on with some more mushy stuff and I was like AWWWW. I am now in love.
 
Chiodos was on next. I didn't like them. Their music is not bad, but I don't know, just didn't enjoy their set.

AND THEN SAOSIN. They (and 30STM) were the whole reason I was there, so I'm freaking out. Oh my God AND THEY WERE SO GOOD! Played all the best songs, sounded amazing, great energy, love love loved it. The singer talked a little too much though. Seriously, for like 20 minutes between a couple songs haha. A bunch of people had those neon glow stick things, and he's like, ""Oh my God give me one of those! I love these things!"" so someone throws a red one at him. And he's up there playing with it, and he goes, ""I wish my pee looked like this."" ... o_O haha, and then the guitarist or bassist or somebody else up there is like, ""No, dude. It's happened to me before. It's not cool."" Ahahaha. But the singer is just like, ""No way, I wanna pee neon red."" and yeah that went on for awhile before they finally continued the set.

Loved them though, so good. Except the audience was lame in my section. Only me and this guy next to me knew all the songs. He looked just like Jared Leto too. Pretty awesome. But he didn't seem too friendly. But I wanted to say something, so..

""You look just like Jared Leto, it's almost scary.""
""Oh, yeah, I get that alot.""
""And your hair smells good.""
And he laughed and then kind of gave me a weird look, haha.
""Yeah, I keep getting pushed behind you, smells awesome back there.""

I know, I'm a creep. But hey he was much friendlier after that, so it worked. And his hair really did smell good. You don't get that too often at concerts.

So, after them some guy came out and said he had bad news. I just got all sick to my stomach right then, because I knew Jared had been sick recently, and he'd just broken his nose, and I just knew he was going to say they couldn't play. But, no, it was The Used that couldn't play. Apparently Bert was really sick and his doctor said if he sang tonight he would probably permanently damage his vocal chords, so they had to cancel. I...don't really like the Used so I was relieved. They're going to put on another free show in September for the people who had tickets to ToC. With some other bands. Hopefully awesome ones!

Senses Fail were next. The singer had to go to a funeral, so the singers for Aiden and Saosin took his place, which was really cool. They did a great job.

And then it was time for 30 Seconds to Mars. They made us wait forever before they finally came on. But when they did....oooooooooooh geez. Every person there was there for them. You could just tell. They performed amaaaazingly. Jared sounded a liiiittle bit nasally, due to that broken nose I guess. And he seemed to push alot of the singing onto the audience, or just plain didn't sing some parts at all, which was a little annoying. But still, a great show. They did an acoustic version of Capricorn and it was preeeetty. I thought they'd play longer since the Used wasn't playing anymore, but nooo. Boooo. I can't actually remember alot of their set, strangely enough. Just that they were good.

So yeeeah I had a TON of fun. I mean...I am in alot alot of pain...I had 7 crowd surfers dropped on my head and was also whacked across the face with a metal pole a few times (haha don't ask), resulting in a splitting headache by the end of the night. Elbowed in the face 3 times, hit in the eye with a flying drumstick (and yet somebody else managed to get the drumstick. how unfair is that.), and I had to break up a fight (which was scary). I ripped my poor throat to shreds and can barely talk at the moment, even though its two days later. Hehehehehehehehe good stuff.</lj-cut>"

sooo, taste of chaos coming up soon, i'm so excited. my chemical romance with support muse (an odd mix made even odder by the fact that muse is <i>supporting</i>, but no way am i complaining) on april 18th, the killers on april 20th. hooray life. i gotta take a little break from concerts after these. unless i get some sort of income coming in, which i'm working on. because many concerts make bliss a broke girl.

driving is going reeeeally well, i like it now that i'm out of parking lots. i still haven't got my permit, but that's another thing i'm working on. i really wish florida had some sort of course for 17 year olds to get their license. then i'd only have to wait 6 months instead of a year. blergh. nonetheless, i hope i get a car for my birthday. i want a civic coupe LX or EX. it's cute, it looks like a little bullet. or maybe i should say big bullet. cause cars are bigger than bullets. yeah. anyway i probably won't be getting a car until i get my license but i'm still hoping so if you see my dad, tell him that's what i want, ok? ok.

is it bad that i'm just now getting into queen? i'm a sad, sad person.

i went over to my neighbor's house and layed on his couch and i came back smelling like either onion or body odor (and not my own). haha ew, boys.

i cut my hair...

(don't look at the dazed/sleepy look on my face. or the bags under my eyes WHEN DID I GET THOSE?)
they're er...more straight across now as opposed to side bangs. and yes i know i'm no hairdresser so they aren't perfect. anyway i'm not sure if i like it or not. they're starting to look like a bowl cut. but maybe not? i'm still working on them. *shrug*

speaking of haircuts, haven (my 4 year old neice) cut henley's (my 2 year old neice) hair. and yes, it is as funny as it sounds. but my sister managed to fix it up so it's actually kind of cute now, though there are definitely a few chunks missing lol. but she does look like a boy so we call her henry now. haven did her bangs too, which my sister also fixed up, and they look adorable. haven's like, ""bliss i look like you now!"" hehe."

i'm driving now, finally. well i've only done it twice. but apparently i'm pretty good so that's cool. i don't like parking. or backing up. or turning. going straight is great though!

Okay, I'll just get right to it. I stood in line for 3 hours. The guy in front of my looked exactly like Brandon (I mean the resemblance was scary, he even had the mustache) except he was fat and had a mohawk and piercings. I really hope the real Brandon never goes for that look. I had some very annoying teenage boys behind me. They had not even heard Sam's Town. I don't know what they were even doing there BUT THEY SUCK. Some annoying girls a little more behind me got TOLD by this other chick. They were talking about how AFI was horrible at the last show, and that their fans were scary, and blah blah blah. So this other chick who was apparently a very big AFI fan got all in her face about AFI's fans being very devoted, and that they ""aren't as scary as your fucking hair right now"". I laughed so hard. I ended up next to those annoying girls during the show. They too had never heard Sam's Town. When they let us in, they were checking people's bags for cameras, but they totally skipped me so I got my camera in. HA! Some guy on the inside asked me again if I had a camera, and I'm all ""Oh heavens no"". HA!

 Cartel were very mediocre. They sounded good, but weren't the greatest performers, and I don't like their music much. And I somehow totally missed the only song I knew. I heard one chorus and I'm like ""Hey I know this song! *rocks out*"" and then it was over. I'm not sure if that was their fault or mine.

 Sparta was much, much better. Their music's more up my alley, and they sounded phenoooomenal. The guitarist was fun and crazy and I like that. He spit water at the crowd once but it ended up getting mostly on the security guards instead. Aaaahahahaha. Yeah but I enjoyed them alot. Taking Back Control is the greatest song ever (nah not really but it's pretty good).

 So then after them, the roadies start getting the stage ready for the Killers. That alone probably took 45 minutes. There were at least 20 christmas trees...and a snowman. IT WAS PRETTY UP THERE. Cluttered, but pretty.

 So the Killers finally come out, and I probably don't have to tell you how loud it was. I think that's the first time I've ever covered my ears at a concert. They opened with Sam's Town, in which Brandon tried to stand on one of the amps, but it started to tip over and he had to jump off. They played Enterlude after that, and god was it beautiful. Then they played When You Were Young and I almost cried (you're going to be hearing that more than a few times in this review). It was just soo good.

Then Brandon says something along the lines of, ""Let's uh...keep it a little twisty..give it a twist.."" and I'm just like, ""Huh?"" until I hear ""DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN, DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN""...those are the opening chords to Somebody Told Me in case you were wondering. And of course everybody is like, ""AHHH SOMEBODY TOLD ME!!!"" Me too. I pretty much screamed until I choked and rammed myself into the rail. I haven't had that much fun since...well since I saw them perform STM last year.

I think Bling was next...this is about the point I start losing track of the songs...in any case, BLING WAS AMAZING. It's my favorite, so I am SO glad they played it. I had to record it, obviously. I don't have to tell you how good it was because you can watch it!

And like I said I lost track of the songs after that, so here's the setlist in no particular order, including the encore:

Sam's Town
Enterlude
When You Were Young
Somebody Told Me
Bling
Uncle Johnny
Jenny Was a Friend of Mine (DUDE. BOYLOVE RETURNS. hahaha. at ""and then you whisper in my ear"" brandon grabbed dave by the hair and ""whispered in his ear"" (figuratively of course). preeeeetty good.)
Mr. Brightside (oh my god. i can't say anything other than OH MY GOD. you catch my drift.)
Indie Rock and Roll
Bones (Brandon started this by saying ""Don't you want to come with me?"" *loud screams from audience* ""Don't you want to feel my bones?"" *loud screams from audience* ""On your bones? *LOUD SCREAMS FROM AUDIENCE* ""It's only natural."" *loud screams from audience*"")
Read My Mind (okay here's another I got teary-eyed during. i mean it's the kind of song that sort of has that effect on you whether it's live or not, but if you've seen them perform it, you know it can just really get you live. or at least, it gets me.)
Smile Like You Mean It
For Reasons Unknown (Brandon on bass is...yay.)
My List (You know in the beginning how it's got the big *boom*s and then this higher pitched...sound? Haha, I can't explain it but you know. Anyway, at the booms, Brandon would stomp his foot on the ground, and then clap for the higher ones. He eventually got the whole place doing it. Just imagine near 20000 people doing *stomp*clap*stomp*clap*. It was awesome. The whole place would just shake everytime they would stomp their foot. So. Cool.)
Exitlude
All These Things That I've Done (totally cried. did that the first time I saw it live too. brandon got up on the piano (i'm not sure how) and held the microphone in the air, and the whole crowd started the ""i got soul but i'm not a soldier""s. we must have said it a hundred times and it was amazing. and then at the end brandon jumped off the piano, and i'm still surprised he landed on his feet.)
A Great Big Sled (AHHH. I SO DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD PLAY THIS. I hadn't heard the song enough to know anything more than the chorus, but still! Oh it was good.)

It seemed like a short set, but I guess it's the average for most bands...but the fact that it was just as long last year and now they have TWO albums, it just seems like they should've done more songs. Like Midnight Show. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DIDN'T DO MIDNIGHT SHOW. And I definitely would have killed for Where the White Boys Dance, but ehhh. I'M NOT COMPLAINING. Nope.

Umm...whenever I write these things, I always feel like there's so many things I forget to put in. I hate that. But it doesn't matter much, because you can't get the real feeling unless you've seen the band before (and hopefully recently). They have grown sooo much and it's just unreal. That arena holds 20,000 people, and it honestly had to be at least 95% full of people who knew every word to every song. It's the most incredible thing to see....this band who, when I saw them a year ago, had maybe 50 people in the audience actually singing, and maybe only 30 people who were truly into it. The band who nooobody knew, and now you can't mention their name to anyone without getting into a lengthy conversation on them. The band who just stood there and played good, but not great, and now they move around everywhere and sound INCREDIBLE. I'm so proud of them. There was a part in the show where the lights were mostly all down, and every person had their cell phone out and waving it around. It was just a freaking SWARM of lights and it really showed how many people were actually there. I wish I'd gotten a picture. It was like a sea of giant fireflies. And that totally sounds like something Will Ferrell would have said, hahaha. But you know what I mean. It was powerfulllll.

<lj-cut text=""pictures"">

Oookay, not the greatest pictures. You see, the stage has this walkway/runway thing in the middle of it, and that's what I was in front of. I was very happy with that spot last time because every member of every band would walk down it constantly and they'd be an arm's length away and it was AWESOME. So I figured I'd get the same spot this time and be happy again. But none of the bands this time walked down it! Okay, the Sparta guy walked halfway down it once, and Brandon came down a couple times BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.. I was really ticked about that because the stage itself was slightly far from where I was...I was only in that spot for the walkway. Yeah anyway so even though I wasn't THAT far away, it was too far for any really great pictures. But I'm posting them anyway.

Cartel:

okay, my camera's depth of field is a bit different than an actual eye, so it looks farther than it actually was. i was not <i>that</i> far away.  but you see what i mean with the walkway thing and how close they are when they actually walk down it.

Ahaha I only took two pictures of Cartel. Apparently.

Afterward I bought the black shirt that says The Killers on front (duh) and ""Run for the Hills Before They Burn"" on the back (I don't get why they have a shirt with the lyric if they don't even play the song live). I haven't taken it off for two days bahaha. It's too big so hopefully it'll shrink. I have the worst luck with sizes. And boy have Killers shirts gotten expensive. They were like 15 and 20 last year and now they're 30 and 40 bucks. Sheesh.

And umm...the whole trip cost me $300, not including tickets (which I don't really count since it was a two for one deal). Yeeeep I'm broke. But soo worth it.</lj-cut>"

"event","The Mistletoe Jam was last night! It was supposed to be with The Killers, AFI, OK Go, and Jet, but ze Killers had to cancel because Brandon is all sickly. So Plain White T's took their place. I was unbelievably upset when I found out they'd cancelled, and I cried, and my mom didn't want to even take me anymore because she thought it wasn't worth it, and I was so upset, but she eventually gave in and took me (with lots of complaining). But anyway, Killers or not, IT WAS SUCH A GOOD SHOW.

So I wake up at 4:30, get showered and dressed, check the computer to make sure the Killers didn't cancel, and it turns out they did. I cried, begged mom to still take me, and on the road we were. Blah blah blah boring 5 hour ride in which we got quite lost.

We got there at...1:30 I think? with the doors to open at 4:30. I couldn't find a line anywhere, and when I finally did there were only 3 people in it. I was happy at first, thinking I was almost first in line but then after awhile when nobody else showed up I was thinking I was probably in the wrong place. So mom goes walking around to see and she calls me and is like, ""There's a line over here with ten or so people in it"" ""There's another one over here"" ""aaaand another..."" so I didn't really know where to go. We find out from a guard which (door is to open first, and THANK GOD, it's a door that's inside the building, so I could get out of the freezing cold. And sit down. IN REAL CHAIRS! Yay. There weren't many people there, and I was so happy, and then maybe 15 minutes before door-opening time, they tell us that people with floor tickets have to go line up somewhere else because they have to get wristbands first (???). So I get sent to this line with like 30 people in front of me. I was not happy, let me tell you. But I'm a trooper so I don't complain. I make friends with a few girls behind me, who in turn make friends with a couple girls behind them, so we have a nice little group. I was by myself at that point so I was really glad for that. We go in, get the stupid wristbands (THEY HAD ELEPHANTS ON THEM), and make our way to the arena. This place was even bigger than I was prepared for. It was amazing. And the best part about it being big (never thought I'd say that) was that there was PLENTY of room for me to get a spot up front. I was right on the railing, front and center. I have never been right on the railing before, so I'm just in lalaland right now. Oh and I lost a few of my little friends I made so it was just me and one other girl now. And then a couple of other girls come up behind us and ask if they can squeeze in between us. So then I'm not next to that girl anymore, and make friends with the new girls, haha. I met alot of people last night.

Anyway, you're not interested in any of that, are you? OK Go comes out first after maybe an hour, AND THEY WERE AMAZING LET ME TELL YOU. Damien, the singer (okay I know there's like 2 singers but the main one with the shaggy hair) walked into the crowd at one point. HE STOOD RIGHT NEXT ME. I MOLESTED HIS LEG A LITTLE BIT. The girl next to me held his hand to steady him when he jumped in, and she was so overjoyed that she gave me a big hug and jumped around with me, bahahah. They did do the little A Million Ways dance, and it's probably the greatest thing you will ever see. No joke.

PWT's were on after them, and omg they were so fun. Their music is just so cute and catchy and happy, and they're such adorable performers, almost annoyingly so, and I just loved it. They had gone on last minute to fill in for the Killers, so you know, good for them. I bought their album after the show.

Now, 90% of the people there were there for AFI, I could tell. So by this point, when AFI were scheduled next, it's getting squishier, everyone's getting excited, the stage is alot cooler looking now, haha...big white speakers, and the lights are being set up (finally...the other two bands had a very minimal light show), big huge white drumset, and it's just pretty. They make us wait for like an hour, and then the radio station dudes come out and tell us they'll be on in a few minutes. The lights go down, and then after 5 minutes, they go back up again. NOT COOL. And then after 10 more minutes, they go back down again. Then the stage lights come on, and you see some people walk out, but the lights are done so that all you can see is their silhouette. But of course we KNOW who it is and we're screaming our heads off. And then BOOM bright lights, loud music, AFI!!!! More screaming and jumping up and down and general chaos! They. put on. the most amazing show. SERIOUSLY. Absolutely stole the show. Soooo much energy. One minute Davey's up front, then Jade's up front and Davey's on the drumset, and then Hunter is on the right, and then Jade's on the left, and Davey's over here, and there, and someone's over here, god they didn't keep still for one second IT WAS AWESOME. Jade is amazing. He'd come right up the front and stand in front of my section and just go all crazy on the guitar. He's very bouncy. He jumps alot. He is amazing I LOVE JADE. But whenever Davey would come and stand in front, holy cow I got a bit friendlier with the rail. Everyone's reaching out and trying to touch him, the weirdos (I wasn't trying to touch him. No. Not meeee). He jumped into the crowd once, but over on the right side, not on my side (poo). They held his legs steady while he stood on their hands and sang. That was cool. But yeah, they put on an incredible show. Especially when they did Silver and Cold. That's my favorite song of theirs, so naturally I just thought it was the best thing I'd ever witnessed BECAUSE IT WAS. 

The girl next to me was...diabetic, or something..anyway, she got really lethargic because of low blood-sugar (we eventually got her a soda), and I was like, ""Well at least you made it through AFI"" and she goes, ""It was AFI that did it!"". Haha.

People cheered for like 20 minutes after they had left. Jet were supposed to come on next, and I was so worried that people wouldn't like them as much. I knew AFI were going to be hard to beat, especially since that's who most people came for in the first place. I didn't want the crowd to be unimpressed or maybe even leave, because I love Jet and well I just don't want them to have their little egos crushed.

But boy was I wrong. They gave AFI some really tough competition, and right now I can't even decide who was better. They played all the right songs, and that singer definitely knows how to work a crowd. He walked into the crowd twice (with the guitar, playing it all the while), stole some guy's beer, rub and kissed the security guy's head, kissed some chick's hand. A couple girls took their shirts off (left the bras on thankfully), and he was definitely pleased with that haha. Then some guy got up and took HIS shirt off, so funny. The drummer is SO good. He sang one of the songs, which I think is so cool because I don't think I could ever drum and sing at the same time. The bassist was crazy. At the end of the show he walked up to the front, slipped and fell. I'm not sure if he did it on purpose or not, but it didn't look like it. But he falls on the floor and is just laying for a couple of minutes, and the crowd's just like O_O and the rest of the band starts walking toward him, and the drummer kind of leans down and touches him and up jumps the bassist, haha. Gaaaah I just loved them. Singer interacted with the crowd so much, I loooove when they do. People cheered for them just as much as they did for AFI. I was so proud. I bought one of their shirts, but all they had left was a small so it's really short on me. I hate short shirts.

I didn't take any pictures because I wasn't expecting to have that good of a spot anyway, and I just wanted to be able to enjoy the concert without worrying about pictures. I really wish I hadn't done that haha.

The drive home was...bad. We weren't even all the way out of Atlanta yet when we hit a deer. A huge one. I cried for an hour. I hate cars. And the right side of ours happens to be wrecked. But I don't really care about that. I just can't stop thinking about the deer. I feel so bad. :(

(Oh god though, we were listening to the radio guys talk about the show, and the DJ was interviewing someone who was at the show, and he's like, ""What'd you think of Davey Havok's eye makeup? All the glitter."" and the other guy's like, ""It was angry glitter. ANGRY!"" bahahahah)

But I don't want to think about that, I'm just so glad I went to the concert. And the Killers are going to reschedule, and I can use my ticket to get into that, so it's all good."

"event","The Panic! at the Disco concert was a couple days ago. It was really awesome, but also disappointing.

I waited in line for four hours and it was cooooold outside and I hadn't brought a jacket. That was just terrible. A couple hours into it though, Jon (Panic!'s bassist) walks out with a football, asking if anyone wanted to play. Cutest thing ever. He organized two teams, and was their...coach I guess. I love him so much for doing that, because people were bored to death and it gave us all something to focus on for an hour. <333 And nobody mobbed him asking for pictures and autographs, so that was cool.

So they finally open the doors, I hide my camera in my pants and carry my bag over the unsightly bulge (cameres weren't allowed). I had a pretty decent spot I thought (considering how many people were there), maybe 5 people back and right in the center. I was happy. I was excited.

Jack's Mannequin were good, though I totally forgot they were opening so I didn't know any songs. 

Bloc Party came on after them, and sounded absolutely great. I'm actually not a fan, so I only knew a couple of their songs, but I like them alot more now. Very, very good performance. And Russell is terribly cute in real life. Or cut<i>er</i>, rather. Unfortunately, the crowd starting getting kind of crazy when Banquet came on. I mean...crazy. I was actually in pain. And...I don't know WHAT I was thinking...but I decided it was too much for me AND LEFT. Went and sat in the balcony instead. I've never done that before and I AM SO MAD AT MYSELF. I should've just toughed it out. The view from the balcony was god awful. So far away. I was near tears. I still get really upset just thinking about it. I am never ever going to sit in a balcony again no matter what happens in the pits. Ergh. Though, in my defense, that crowd was pretty bad. From the balcony I could see fist fights breaking out, and like 5 different mosh pits. It was kind of scary. But I'm still mad at myself.

Panic! finally comes on, and....just incredible. They pulled back a curtain and the stage was suddenly about three times bigger, Spencer is on this HUGE pedestal, and it's so colorful, and there's dancers, and strippers, and acrobats, and drag queens, and stiltwalkers....really stunning.

Their setlist was the whole album (played in the same order as on the album too, which was cool...more bands should do that), and they also covered Killer Queen and Eleanor Rigby. Those were both AMAZING, especially Eleanor Rigby. Brendon's voice was goooorgeous.

Afterward I went to get some shirts, but the line was enormous. I waited for about 20 minutes without it moving at all, so I just said to hell with it, I probably would've been there for hours. Disappointment #2.

We were trying to decide whether to stay and try to meet the band, but eventually decided that we didn't have the time. So we leave, and about ten minutes down the road we turn around and go back to wait, haha. But we get there and...everybody's gone. I'm scared to death, thinking that they already came out and did it all. But apparently they ""don't do that at that venue"", because the guards had just chased everyone off. Oh I was angry. I was so close to finally meeting a band! Disappointment #3.

So...yeah, it was really an amazing show, but it could've been better. I'm disappointed in the general experience, but not in Panic!. Which makes me feel bad because it's really not their fault and I should be happier. I can't wait for them to come back so I can actually see them up close.

I got a new phone. <a href=""http://www.virginmobileusa.com/phones/phoneDetail.do?skuId=VMKX5C"">This one.</a> I love it, but it doesn't get very good service at my house, which is pretty uncool. So I have to take it back and get another, but the only thing is, I can't find another one I like. I have to get a prepaid phone by either Tmobile or Cingular, and none of them are too desirable. I love <a href=""http://onlinestorez.cingular.com/cell-phone-service/cell-phones/cell-phones.jsp?q_categoryId=all&WT.svl=scm1&q_deviceId=cdsku9870230&WT.svl=img"">this </a>phone, but it isn't prepaid. I can't use the monthly plans because the cheapest ones are like, what, 30 bucks a month, and I really only use up about 15 or 20 a month (with the prepaids). So I don't really know what I'm going to do yet. DECISIONS.

I LOVE SCISSOR SISTER'S NEW ALBUM I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE HOW GOOD IT IS. Same goes for Kasabian.

I'm getting <a href=""http://www.beautifulhairstyles.com/2006/hairstyle.html"">this</a> done to my hair tomorrow, cut and color(s). I'm so excited and they better not screw it up.

"event","I've been back from Virginia for...6 days now. I don't know what took me so long to do this. Maybe that rather nasty case of hives I had. But anyway, pictures! They're mostly of she and I, because both of us are into photography and never have anyone to take pictures of, so we went CRAZY! I took the ones of her, and she took the ones of me...that was an obvious statement. I'm the brunette but I think most if not all of you knew that.

<a href=""http://s112.photobucket.com/albums/n171/youcancallmerad/Plane/"">Plane pictures.</a>
I was hoping for a cool sunset or something, but no, just clouds. The ones where I'm on the ground were my 4 hours in hell. They got us all on the plane, and then it started storming so we couldn't leave. FOR 4 HOURS. JUST SITTING. ON A PLANE. No snakes.

<a href=""http://s112.photobucket.com/albums/n171/youcancallmerad/Deer/"">Deer!</a>
There's deer there! In her backyard, and alongside the roads! I know they're terrible pictures, but hey it's deer.

<a href=""http://s112.photobucket.com/albums/n171/youcancallmerad/Scenery/"">General scenery.</a>
Well, yeah. A pretty place, isn't it?

<a href=""http://s112.photobucket.com/albums/n171/youcancallmerad/Backyard/"">Backyard.</a>
We took pictures in her backyard. The lighting was really bad and we look all pale(r). And some of them are blurry. And it was kind of wet out so we're frizzy. But, whatever.

<a href=""http://s112.photobucket.com/albums/n171/youcancallmerad/In%20the%20Mountains/"">In the Mountains.</a>
So we went up in the mountains, and guess what we did! The lighting was nice this time. It was all orange and sunshiney (most of the time). 

<a href=""http://s112.photobucket.com/albums/n171/youcancallmerad/The%20Peaks/"">The Peaks.</a>
These were also in the mountains, but different ones. There were lots of trees and a tunnel and little paths and a lake and a bridge thing and it was pretty freaking awesome. And yeah, we did wear (almost) the same shirt.

<a href=""http://s112.photobucket.com/albums/n171/youcancallmerad/Wall/"">Um..wall?</a>
Yeah I wasn't sure what to name these, haha. They were taken against her bedroom wall. We were bored.

<a href=""http://s112.photobucket.com/albums/n171/youcancallmerad/Makeup/"">Crazy makeup time!</a>
HOORAY FOR WHORE MAKEUP! Haha. All makeup courtesy of me, btw. Because I'm just that good. 

<a href=""http://s112.photobucket.com/albums/n171/youcancallmerad/Vampires/"">Vampiressss.</a>
The same makeup, but we just added some fake blood and sexy/scary looks. We're not really freaks in real life. IT WAS HER IDEA OKAY.

"event","AHHHH MUSE CONCERT LAST NIGHT AHHHHH UNBELIEVEABLE AHHHHH BEST SHOW I'VE EVER BEEN TO AHHHHHHH!

AHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Okay yeah. I was completely blown away. They are the most impressive live band EVER. I was elbowed in the mouth, hip, and head (3 times), and I was kneed in the butt, but that's all fine by me.

I waited in line for 4 hours, and wanted to smack the chick in front of me. She tried to sell pot, bragged about doing cocaine with the Strokes, and showed off the needle marks in her arms. She was also in a tube top, mini skirt, fishnet stockings, and stilettos. I just....grrr. I ended up behind her during the show. Nooo!

So anyway, when I walk in, all I can look at is the stage. There's 5 long, plastic tubes hanging from the ceiling, and large curtain/screen things, and...well it was strange looking. Two guys in front of me were talking about what they could possibly do with them. 

""They'll fill up with bubbles! Orange bubbles!""
""That's how they'll make their entrance! They'll come sliding down the tubes!""
""All 5 of them?""

Hahaha.

The Cloud Room opened, and were sooo good. Hey Now Now and Waterfall were superb. They didn't do Blue Jean or Beautiful Mess, bummerrrr.

When Muse came out, I just went into total shock for a few seconds. I don't know if I'd call them my favorite band (though they're definitely in my top 5), but I think I respect them more than any other band. The fact that just 3 guys can have such a powerful sound, and that only one guy can write music like that....awe inspiring. Yeah, so seeing them in person was just a really surreal moment. But anyway the shock passed and I started screaming.

THE LIGHTS. HOLY CRAP THE LIGHTS! It was the coolest light show I've ever seen! So colorful, so synchronized, so awesome. There were times when they lights would make a pattern on the walls...once it looked like we were inside a waterfall or something, I don't know. It was just really neat. And they had pictures and videos up on the huge screens, it was amazing. During Knights of Cydonia they had a silhouette of a horse's legs running, that was probably my favorite. They put lyrics up on the screen...singing disco balls...apparently there was a cameraman somewhere, because the band themselves were also on the screen from time to time, complete with super cool special effects to make them look...well, cool. They put the audience up there too. I saw my hand.

They opened with Take a Bow...it was so funny, because everyone was screaming, but then as soon as the music started they whole place went silent, and then once they realized what song it was, started screaming again.

Setlist..
Take a Bow
Hysteria (So. Much. Fun.)
Supermassive Black Hole (oh man. so much better live than on album.)
Butterflies and Hurricanes (GLORIOUS. The piano...ughgdhgkdhgdgd.)
Starlight
Forced In
Bliss (I freaked out when I realized what song it was.)
Feeling Good
Soldiers Poem
Invincible (Lots of swaying.)
Plug In Baby (Moshing got bad for this one. The only song they moshed for.)
New Born
Stockholm Syndrome (oh boy. sexy.)
------
Map of the Problematique
Time Is Running Out (haha, biggest sing-a-long ever)
Knights of Cydonia (THIS. THIS WAS THE BEST.)

I'm bummed about pretty much EVERY song they didn't play, but I was really hoping for Micro Cuts. I guess it would have been too straining on Matt's voice though.

Dom was wearing very bright, very yellow pants. And he was very smiley. And very, very fun to watch. 

Chris is so passionate in his backup singing. He looks like he puts his all into it. 

And Matt, well, Matt is unbelieveable. I can't even believe the sounds that come out of his guitars (goodness he had alot of guitars). Even more unbelieveable are the sounds that come out of HIM! The most impressive vocal range.





After the show, the guy that was next to me asked for my phone number. HAHA.

Also after the show, I went and waited by the back for the band to come out. I waited for 30 or 45 minutes, and then when I saw roadies bringing pizza in to the band, I figured they wouldn't be coming out anytime soon so I just gave up. I would've stayed longer if my mom hadn't been getting restless. Sigh. Next time!

So now that I've written probably the crappiest review of my life, pictures and a video!

The theater was completely mobbed when we got there (and we were 45 minutes early). Four showings, each one starting 5 minutes after the other, ALL sold out (we bought our tickets beforehand, though). Crazy. And this is at 12am, remember. Made me prooooud. I felt like I was at a concert, walking through that place. I sort of expected a mosh pit to break out at any minute. JUST SO MANY PEOPLE! Even though we were as early as we were, the line was huge and so therefore we got crappy seats. But that's okay! When the movie started, the whole theater went ""WOOOOOO!"" and then when Johnny Depp came on screen everyone clapped, lolz. Such a great movie! I recommend it to eeeeeveryoooone. I love love loved Keira Knightley in it. She did so well. I mean, the whole cast was great, but she just stood out more this time to me.

Hahaha WHATEVER!
Last week went by so slow. I still have 12 days before the puppy comes home. UCK.
I really wanna go to England. Or New York would be fine too.
I'm going to Virginia in August. Not quite New York, but I'm going there to visit <lj user=_riot_girl_05_> so that's pretty cool. I'm very excited (exclamation mark exclamation mark exclamation mark). Except it means I'll be ALONE on a plane. BY MYSELF. Ohh scary.
Jack White on the cover of Spin looks like Michael Jaaacksooon. I wish Spin would stop putting inappropriate things on their covers (by this I do not mean Jack White) because my mother usually checks the mail before I do, AND THEREFORE. She says she doesn't think she likes all the porn in it, haha. WHATEVER MOM.
Joel Mchale of The Soup says Tom Hanks' hair makes him look like the creepy old guy at a White Stripes concert. Haha I love it. 
I still haven't seen Da Vinci Code yet. Really want to.
But I want to see X Men 3 even more. REALLY want to. Nobody wants to go with me. Why don't YOU go with me?
Ahh hell.
The other day I dropped a wooden spoon into the blender and ever since seeing it ripped to shreds I've had these nightmares about getting various body parts stuck in a blender (including my tongue, though I'm not sure how that would work). It's waaaay unpleasant.

"event","Strokes concert numero two was last nite (see what I did there? no? ok.)! 

The ride there was full of joyous music such as Arctic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, and of course, The Strokes. My mp3 player also thought that I needed a little one on one time with Interpol, so there you go. A good (but very long) ride.

I saw <lj user=""youlovejazz""> (from now on known as Katie) when I got there, but my whole ""Hey, I saw that girl at the Killers concert"" plan called for discreetness so we both just sorta waved at each other.

This girl came up to me once, and as soon as I saw her, before she even said anything I thought ""Swedish"". She had blonde hair and bright blue eyes and just had that...pure look about her, haha. Anyway, I had my Sounds shirt on, which says ""The Sounds, EST 1998, Helsingborg Sweden"" on it. So she comes up to me, and is like, ""Have you been to Sweden??!"" but alas, no, that is only where the band is from. But she was all excited, ""I'm from Sweden! And I love the Sounds!"" in her little accent. It was cool. That's the second time I've met someone through a Sounds tshirt, haha.

Then an hour or so later people started moving to the gate, so when I got near Katie I was just like, ""Hey I know you!"" Haha. Then when we actually got into the place, my sister and her friends decided to ditch me, which worked out well and I just hung around with Katie the whole time. 

The place was SO COOL. It was outdoors, but it was also roofed (rooved?).
I shouldve taken some pictures of it, but in case you didn't already know, the concert was held at an old iron furnace that is supposedly haunted. Very cool.

Umm, Apples in Stereo, I thought they kind've sucked. I mean they were okay while they were playing, but compared to the Strokes they just...wow bad. I liked Eagles of Death Metal better.

I think one of my favorite parts of the entire experience was this: Katie's talking to her friend, but there's a guy in between them so she has to talk over his head a bit. Then the guy says, ""You just spit on me."" Katie's just got this shocked stare...it was so random. Funniest thing ever. Weird too, because that guy was being really nice up until then.

The Strokes made us wait a very, very long time. The crowd was starting to get kind of mad, and I don't blame 'em. BAD STROKES BAD. Buuut then they were out and all was good. Opened with Ize of the World (unexpected choice). SO DAMN AMAZING.

The crowd was CRAZY. They were pushing so hard, and it was so tightly packed and my hair kept getting pulled. About 5 or 6 songs into the show, Katie and I asked to be pulled out. It was a shame, because we had great spots. But we really could not take that anymore. Breathing was getting difficult. So anyway, securty guards picked us up and over the gate (that was so weird. I haven't been picked up in 10 years.) and then we had to go back to the middle of the crowd, against the wall. Couldn't see much, but nobody pushed us there, haha. Couple of really young boys right in front of us were smoking pot and one of them kept staring at Katie and I. So then I was like, ""Dude, what do you want."" and he was like, ""Huuuhhh..?"" and I was like, ""WHY DO YOU KEEP LOOKING OVER HERE"" and he was just like, ""Haaahadfzaa...naaaaahhhaa."" 

Stupid potheads.

Anyway, during the encore (I think they played like 5 or 6 songs for it!), Julian said ""This is the last song"" but then the audience started booing really loudly. So he was like, ""Umm...okay...I'll take that as a...no? Fair enough, this ISN'T the last song!"" and everyone was happy and they played maybe 2 songs after that. Awww, I LOVE EM. 

They did a...Ramones cover? I think. He said something like ""This is a Ramonesy cover of an Unramonesy song."" I don't know what that means, and I couldn't hear what the song was called sooo. It wasn't Life's a Gas though. 

After the show Katie and I and her friends went looking for the tour bus, but when we got near it some guy told us we couldn't go back there. Bastard. Katie stayed around a bit longer than I did though, so maybe she got to meet them. I hope so. If her computer wasn't broken SHE COULD TELL ME. Haha. (Does anyone have her cell phone number? PM it to me on TKN if you do.)

Right though, it was an amazing show. They're so freaking good live. I don't know what it is. But everyone I've been to their shows with has said that it was the most amazing concert they've ever gone to (and these people go to alot of concerts too). 

<lj-cut text=""a few pictures"">

I couldn't get very many. When we were up front, one of my hands was holding tightly to the railing, and my other was holding tightly to Katie because neither one of us wanted to get seperated. Poor Katie got sucked into the crowd once and it was a bit of a struggle getting her back, haha. But yes, I didn't have many chances up there, and then we moved to the back it was just too far away for good pictures. But that's okay.

"event","Ashlee Simpson concert wasn't as bad as I expected. She sounded pretty good and had alot of energy...put on a good show. She's alot prettier in real life. Very pretty. I like her hair. She had a nose job recently...you can tell and it looks aloooot better.

Some guy named Chris August opened for her, apparently he's also her keyboardist. Must be trying to break out or something. He sounded like an acoustic Justin Timberlake...not really my thing. For his last song he brought Ashlee's band out to play with him and that was alot better because her band is seriously good.

The place was alot smaller than it looks on TV, haha. And it wasn't even sold out so that was really good.  We got stuck next to these obnoxious fat chicks who WOULD NOT SHUT UP. They kept talking to each other and screaming things at the people on stage over and over again, even though said people were obviously ignoring them/couldn't hear them. Drove me crazy. Not to mention they were pushers. And one of them tried to tell me about her Pussycat Dolls concert. Somebody beside them was saying that her first concert was Lynyrnd Skynyrd (uhh I can't spell that), and one of the obnoxious girls was like, ""Oh yeah, isn't he in the Beatles?"" 

.....

I eventually managed to get away from them and got next to a couple of guys instead. They were nicer and had far more interesting things to say. There was some guy in front and Ashlee made his day by saying that he looked liked Tyson from the All American Rejects, and that she has a crush on him. I would not have minded being beside THAT guy. Haha. 

There sure were alot of gays there. It's really kind of weird seeing a guy buying an Ashlee Simpson poster.

There was this one part where it was just her band doing an instrumental song. Aweeessooooooome. I love her band. They need a new singer. I don't have anything against Ashlee, but they're way too good for her.

Got there 30 minutes before the doors opened, line was surprisingly short. There was a guy in line who was a dead ringer for a young Nick Valensi, which was weird. 10 minutes after I get there, I look over at the Sounds tour bus (which is only about 20 feet away), and see Jesper leaning against it, talking on a cell phone. That was a shock, and I didn't really know what to do so I just kept staring. He eventually noticed me, and that was awkward. I wanted to take a picture but not with him staring at me, it seemed stalkerish. Actually I really wanted to go say hi, but he was on the phone. He finally walked into the venue.  Then maybe 10 minutes after that, Felix walks out of the bus and into the venue. It was so awesome because either nobody recognized them or people were cool enough not to make a fuss. I think it was the latter. Oh, and I can hear Action Action warming up inside this whole time. That was cool. 

Sooo then at 7 we go in, and there's a bar and stuff so everyone's milling around that, which made the stage area basically empty, so getting a good spot was eeeeasy.  Front row center, bitches (eventually got pushed to second row semi center, but that's okay).  Even Felix went over to the bar. Again, nobody making a fuss. Cool. 

Action Action came on first at 8, THEY WERE SO GOOD MY GOD PEOPLE. Sounded amazing, alot of energy, just really freaking good. I was one of the only people who actually knew the songs, and the bassist noticed this. During The Game, he pointed at me and I think he said ""Yeah!"",  but I can't read lips. Close to the end of the song, he comes and stands in front of me, points the neck of the bass at me while playing it (obviously), and then after the song is over he hands me his guitar pick...like REALLY HANDED IT TO ME PERSONALLY OMG. And then proceeds to give me those rock fingers, horns, whatever they're called. It was pretty awesome.
<img src=""http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/4540/img19729oy.jpg"">
Okay so it's nothing special. IT'S SPECIAL TO ME.

The singer made all these amusing faces, he reminded me of Craig Nicholls. There was one part where he exactly knocked over his keyboard, and then tried to kick it back up, but it wasn't working. So the other guitarist quickly ran over and put it back up. But then it wobbled a bit and almost fell over again but the singer caught it. It was funny. And then after they were done and taking their stuff off stage, the drummer walked by the same keyboard and knocked it over again, hahaha. Everybody laughed at himmmm.

So yeah, they were awesome. Then at 9:15ish, Morningwood comes on. Also awesome. The singer was the most entertaining person I've ever seen. She pretty much made out with a guy next to me, pulled the guy with the multicolored hair's hair, got some girls on stage and took their shirts off, and straddled one. She did crazy dancing, aerobics, rode ponies, cheerleaded. She slapped the bassist's butt multiple times (he eventually started running from her), and made him slap her on the face several times. Seriously amusing.

During the Nth Degree...you know that part that goes ""M-O, M-O-R, M-O-R-N-I-N-G, W-O-O-D."", and it starts off quiet and then she sings it louder and louder? Yes, well, she made us all squat down for the quiet part, and then we'd stand up a little each time it got louder. That was hard, because I had to either use the guy in front of me's shoulders to pull myself up or fall over. Awkward. We also played a game. I believe she said it was called ""Whore"".  She said we had to prove ourselves to be ""the bead of sweat on the titty nipple"", also known as super awesome. So during one song, she told us to clap to a specified beat, and when we did that, we earned ourselves the titty. Next song, she had us to aerobics with her, in which we earned the titty nipple. Next song, we did a ""Grind Pit"", earned a B in that, and then next song we earned an E, than an A, a D, and then we were super awesome. Hahahah. Weird.

Jetsetter, Nu Rock , and Body 21 were all AMAZING, definitely the best ones of their set. Especially Body 21. Fun. 

I saw Jesper watching their performance in the background, and commenced my staring at him again. He noticed again, and ran away backstage again. I scare Jesper.

Cheerleading!

AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN! THE SOUNDS. The whole crowd was so on edge, and everytime the lights would go out, or the music would turn off the whole place freaked out. More often than not it was a false alarm. But then they really did come out and it was the best thing ever because it was really THE SOUNDZZZZZZZ whoaoaoaoaoaoaoa.  They cam one stage to Journey's Don't Stop Believin',  and the whole crowd was singing along and it was amusing. Opened with 24 Hours, sounded sooooooooo great.  Set list went something like:

Queen of Apology
25 Hours
Painted by Numbers
Night After Night (alternative version) - People got their lighters out for this one, hahaha.
Ego
Much Too Long Now
Seven Days a Week
Dance With Me
Rock n Roll
Living in America
Hit Me!
Fire
Hope You're Happy Now

That includes the encore...I wonder if I'm forgetting some songs, because that seems really short. I don't think I am though. Hm. They didn't do Don't Want to Hurt You or Tony the Beat, which really sucks because those are my favorites. Nor did they do Mine For Life, that's a big surprise to me.  Oh well. 


Random things I remember:
Jesper running over to Felix's microphone and going, ""BOO!"", Felix not expecting it and being slightly startled. Hilarious.
Fredrick running over to Felix and slapping him on the butt, Felix giving him a ""WTF?"" kind of face. Poor Felix got picked on that night.
Maja stage diving (which I got on video!).
MAJA IS SO LITTLE. Oh man. Really short, and really...bony. Not anorexic, just...bony. I don't know, I can't explain it. She's really tiny.
Maja thanking us ""from the bottom of my swedish heart."" I was really hoping she'd say that.
Maja (yeah, again) running back on stage after they were done, grabbing her shoes, winking at the crowd, then running backstage again.

So anyway, after the show, as I'm walking out, I see Action Action's guitarist handing out little sampler CDs. He tries to hand me one, but I'm like, ""I already have both albums."" but he sorta shoved it in my face anyway so I took it. Then I had to walk back in because I forgot to buy a shirt. I go over to the merchandise line, and asked this guy and chick in front of me if they were in line. They're both wasted, and the chick's like ""YES WE ARE."" and I'm all okay but then she's like, ""Oh. I said that nasty. I'm sorry. Sorry. Go ahead, get in front of me. Sorry."" and then the dude looks at me and says to the chick ""She's hot"", and I was freaked out by that point and quickly got in front of them. I hate drunks. Members of Action Action and Morningwood are all hanging around, and I saw the cool bassist who gave me the pick. I felt like I should go talk to him but I didn't want to lose my place in line, and by the time I got out of it I couldn't find him. So that sucked. It was cool though because, yet again, nobody made a fuss out of all the rockstars (now if the Sounds had been hanging around, I think it would have been different). Everyone just said a few words to them, didn't ask for pictures or autographs. It was the coolest venue. Everyone was laid back and cool.

So then as I'm walking out again, AA's guitarist tries to give me another CD. ""You already gave me one!"" He just sorta looked at me and said, ""Damnit."" Haha. I started walking away and then he was like, ""Hey!"" so I turn around and he threw the CD in my face. So  I have two AA sampler CDs now. Woohoo?

Oh, and videos!

I really recommend those, audio and video are both good on them. During LiA, Maja stage dives, and then kisses the security guard that got her back on stage. And Johan also comes over to my camera and sticks his tongue out (which I didn't realize until last night, so it was a nice surprise).  At the end of Ego, Jesper and Felix get on the electronic drums and rock out and it's so freaking great. Also, I'm not the one who screams ""Fuck yeah!"", haha. Lame.

Ummmm so yeah. I feel like I'm forgetting alot but oh well. It was the best show, and I loved the venue.  Very intimate...no security guards stand in front of you, you're so close you can touch the band. Which many did, as you can see. Hopefully not the last show I see there. </lj-cut>

Oh yeah, and I'm seeing the Strokes AGAIN. And this time Katie's gonna come, aren't ya Katie? Soooo excited."

"event","Orlando was cool. Islands of Adventure was fun. I got very very soaked on a ride and I was wearing a white shirt. You can only imagine. The Jurassic Park ride, whatever it was called, SCARED ME. I mean, it's all happy and pretty until the T-Rex comes along. He's not the scary part. He distracted you from the scary part.  I'm sitting there staring at him, wondering how close those rather large jaws are going to come, when out of nowhere the boat raft thing I'm sitting in is plunging 80 feet down, literally STRAIGHT down. Oh my good God I thought my eyes were going to pop out of my head. And my mouth hurt from screaming. I was shaking when we got off. It was pretty awesome.

The Spiderman 3D virtual thingamebob was amazing.

Yeah so, a merry time was had by all.

Yay autographs! Jesper's is pretty much illegible. 13 days 'til I see 'em, woohoo. </lj-cut>

I finally got my hands on Franz Ferdinand's DVD and I LOVE IT (what I've watched, anyway). The Tour Documentary is hilarious. 3-0-0-9! Oh and Bob totally pwning that poser fan. Rock on, Bob."

<lj-cut text=""AND IT WAS THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE!"">SERIOUSLY!!! I know I haven't been to very many concerts, but this was the best one EVER. I have never had so much fun. EVER! Alright, let's start from the beginning.

We left for Atlanta around 9:30. I wanted to leave at 8 but my alarm clock failed to...alarm me. So that was not a good start. Got there 5 hours later, plus an hour ahead in the timezone, so around 3:30. I had wanted to be at the venue by 4. But then we had to wait for my uncle to get off  work because we had no idea where to go. We ended up getting to the Tabernacle at damn 5:30. I was angered by this, but the line was not so bad yet, so yeah lucky me. Doors didn't open until 7, so that was dull. And it was really cold outside too, and I had failed to bring a jacket. NOT COOL. But there were alot of really hot guys around so that kept me entertained, haha. There were 3 or 4 guys there dressed as Julian, which was cool because they really did look like him. One of them had that awesome jacket Julian used to wear, the black one with the red piping and gold buttons. Yeah. Pretty nice.

Okay, it's 7 o clock now, the doors are opening, everyone is stampeding in. My sister and I sorta got lost first and ended up in the restroom instead of at the stage, hahaha. Idiots. Then we found it and pushed our way up as close as we could, which was pretty close. About 3 people back, which is close considering how squished together you are (which we definitely were). Eagles of Death Metal, the opening band, didn't come on until 8. THEY WERE REALLY GOOD. Surprisingly. I really wasn't expecting much from them, but man, really awesome. The entire crowd seemed pretty into it, although nobody knew the words. But you know, everyone's dancin' and groovin'. The singer kept saying that it was the best audience they'd had so far (but I know they always say that). He also kept telling us to ""Give it up for the ladies"" and then everyone would scream and scream and scream. He made us do that after pretty much every song, lmao. He also kept saying how hot all the ladies were. He was a real charmer, yes. Oh, but he did tell the guys to move back so that the ladies could get up front and dance. Nobody listened, but it was a nice gesture anyway. The drummer was a chick and she rocked HARD. Very very awesome. I think I heard about 5 guys around me say, ""She's fucking hot!""

So their set lasted until 9, and the Strokes were supposed to come on at 9:15. Well, the Strokes are obviously much too cool for us regular folk because they showed up at 9:30, haha.  OH. MY. GOD. The crowd went CRAZY as soon as we saw them. I mean, wow. Loud as hell in there, and I think everyone took 3 steps forward because I was suddenly much closer to the people in front of me. Julian did this thing where he staggered backward with his hands up, and slowly fell backward. You know, as if we were overwhelming him. The very first thing he said to us was, ""You guys are really loud..."" Hahaha!

<img src=""http://img462.imageshack.us/img462/1796/strokes489ck.jpg"">
Hahaha aw. Gotta love him.


They opened with You Only Live Once, which was suuuuuch a good choice.  The moshing started then, but not <i>too</i> badly. They played Juicebox next, and then that is when all hell broke loose. I thought I had been in mosh pits before, but this was the mother of all mosh pits. I think my feet touched the ground once through the entire song. Everyone was pushing and shoving and I could just barely breathe, let alone sing along (but I did anyway!). Oh, and it was also VERY. VERY. HOT. in there so everyone was nasty and sweaty and slipping and sliding against each other and NGGGGHGHGA. It was pretty bad. The Strokes sounded really great though!

I don't remember the order of the setlist, but I do remember what they played, so, in no particular order:

You Only Live Once
Juicebox
Heart in a Cage
Razorblade
Ask Me Anything (Aww Nick and his little Mellotron. It sounded sooo beautiful. Julian called him Mr. Mellotron.)
Electricityscape (Julian said it had gotten requested alot, so they added it to the setlist that night.)
Ize of the World
Vision of Division (SO psyched they played those two, because I wasn't seeing either of them on recent setlists and I was bummed that they might not play them. But they did! And it was amazing!)
Red Light (Crazy fun, this song is live.)
Is This It
The Modern Age
Someday
Alone, Together
What Ever Happened?
Last Nite (more crazy moshing for this, but I was so happy by that point I didn't give a damn)
Hard to Explain (BEST SONG OF THE NIGHT. The chorus is waaay too much fun and and and I don't know this was just great)
Trying Your Luck (That would be my favorite song, totally glad they put that one in.)
Reptilia (YAAAAAAAAY! You people haven't lived until you've seen this song live!)
12:51
Meet Me in the Bathroom
The Way It Is
The End Has No End (This was probably the second best of the night)

Encore:
New York City Cops!!!!!! (Poor Jake had been hoping they'd play it since the very beginning of the show, so we were both pretty thrilled.)
I Can't Win
Take It Or Leave It (GAH!!! SO GOOD! SO FUN! CRAZY JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND DANCING AND WAAAHEEEEEEEEY! A good closer.)


So overall, it was  GREAT setlist. It would have been better if they had played On the Other Side, 15 Minutes, Hawaii, and Fear of Sleep (just because it would be fun to scream ""YOU'RE NO FUN!""), but I'm not complaining.

And I have to tell you guys...even with that hair, Nick is still really damn good looking in real life. o_O Even Jake said, ""I'm not gay, but he's pretty hot."" Hahahahaha I laughed a little too hard at that and he laughed back at me.

Alright, (more) pictures! Only half of them turned out, because I accidentally changed a setting on the camera without realizing it, and from then on the pictures sucked. But I did get alot of good ones. I'm posting them.

<a href=""http://s38.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=1XMUZMN9EVNP70MY6PRXDNAMEW"">Most of What Ever Happened</a>
<a href=""http://s38.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=38IGZN5L37E2Z3O5U04EW98GYJ"">40 seconds of Ask Me Anything</a>
(sorry they aren't whole videos, but I wasn't sure how much space my camera was going to hold...plus I was getting pushed around alot as you might notice, and I didn't really want to drop my camera on someone's head.)

So yeah, it was really the best time ever and I can't wait for them to come back. I ache from head to toe, and my voice is almost completely gone, but I would be reeeally happy to do it again.</lj-cut>"

So. My cousin is in a band. (I can't remember if I ever mentioned this.) It's called The Blueslide Circle. He's the bassist/backup singer. You may go <a href=""http://www.theblueslidecircle.co.uk"">here</a> to visit their website. And go to the music section and download Love is Too Little because it's GREAT. There's also a few other songs under the links that say ""3 a b c D"", but LiTL is the best so I recommend it. Oh yes, and go <a href=""http://www.studentmusicawards.co.uk/"">here</a>, scroll down to The Blueslide Circle, and watch a live performance! I think it's pretty much the coolest thing ever. Once they put an album out, I'll have CONNECTIONS. WHOA. Neat.
Edit: Oh wow I just realized they're doing a gig with LARRIKIN LOVE. Now that is cool. Yeah. Um. I wish they lived here instead of in England."

"event","Been in Louisiana for the past week...fun stuff. Shopped alot...went there with $200 and spent $220, haha. Visited sisters and aunts and cousins and grandparents and nggghh. Accidentally asked some random guy to hold me. 

Poor Samson (my horse) is in bad shape. He was given to these people and they were stupid, and shot some guns in the pasture. That scared him, he flipped out, tripped over a tree stump or <i>something</i>, got all banged up, went off his food...ugh. He looks horrible. Thankfully he's home for good now, though nobody's sure if he'll ever be rideable again. :(

So, here's Sammy before:

He's lost a ton of weight. He's got a fluffy winter coat now, so he doesn't look <i>too</i> bad, but he certainly feels boney.

And his leg, of course:
<img src=""http://img370.imageshack.us/img370/4285/dsc071405hn.jpg"">
He can hardly walk, but he hobbled up to me when I went to say goodbye. Poor thing.

Gah. Okay. Happier pictures. Less depressing pictures.

So there's this band called The Pharmacy coming to Pensacola in April. I've only heard three songs but they seem pretty cool. Sooner or later I'll ask my sister if she wants to go. BUT FIRST, The Strokes. Yessss.

Sorta.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually,i walked around the convention looking for something to do when i saw Jose and Jessica together and for the lulz,challenged him to Sleeping Samurai,he accepted but some asshole from the forums caught my eye so i challenged him instead. We went over to fight and in short,i won 3-0,it was no competition and the guy hated me too so you think he would have pent up rage,but no. It was disappointing but at least it was over with</div>"

"event","On with the review!<br /><div>Thursday</div><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">Arriving at the hotel around 10:30AM so i could help out with the set up,but the problem was.....i had no idea where to go,so waited an hour waiting for someone recognizable from the con scene to help out,eventually Mike,one of the guys from AnimeFunTV pointed me out to Lauren (Proz's girlfriend),she immediately put me to work,grabbing equipment from the garage and placing them to the third floor,this lasted a few hours.</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">After awhile,all the volunteers (all eight of us),took a break,some went to the mall to get something to eat and the rest watched over a room where all the stuff was at so nobody would steal it,and ran into a old schoolmate named Scott who was also volunteering,we talked a little bit,went to the food court and take some free samples,and went back to work.Stayed until 6PM,went home got something to eat and finished packing and went back to the hotel an hour later to finish setting up the Dealer's Room.</div><div style=""text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"">After helping out some more,just pretty much hanged out with George at the Gamer Room,saw Mr 12345,and challenge him to a game of NBA&nbsp;Jam on the SNES but he had to do something,so it was me and George,lost twice and insulted him (out of love!),pretty much messed around with the video games until midnight,and headed to the hotel room (Mr Hicks gave me the hotel card earlier the day) to find out i had a roommate named Greg who hosts anime game-shows,he's a cool guy.Talked for awhile and said good night</div><div><br />Friday</div><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">After getting only 5 hours of sleep,woke up around 8AM,showered and got dressed.When i got to the third floor,i ran into my friend Sammy from school,and Dezzy and her boyfriend from the forums,afterward went to my girlfriend's panel,Kodomo Corner is basically Beginners Japanese,Origami,Chopstick lessons.My job was basically attract people to the panel,it's not as easy as it sounds.It was that for four hours,which went by pretty fast.After congratulating her for a successful panel,i headed to my hotel room preparing to pick up Kathy and Cynthia from the bus station,when i called her,she told me that something came up and they couldn't go anymore.That seriously sucked,cause it's been almost a year since we've seen each other,but she told me to have fun for her,which i promised i would</div><div>After the call,me and Amanda relaxed in the hotel room for awhile until it was time for the Forum Meet up,holy crap it's kinda weird seeing people from the internet actually in front of you,it was good seeing everyone,even better Kitty as Doctor Who hosted the event,since Seb was god knows where.It was nice,but it became like the forums and went completely off topic,and then everyone left suddenly,but it went well,that's the important thing.Me and Amanda went walking around until 5PM because that's when&nbsp; i had to start patrolling the convention,she left later on,so it was nothing but walking here and there until 9PM.Saw Eraz and told me that he was going to the Masquerade (i got a Guy Fawkes mask thanks to George earlier),so i went with him and then i saw the line which had like 200 people in it,naturally i said &quot;fuck this&quot;,and stumbled into the karaoke room,and after setting everything up and people had their turn i got&nbsp; to sing Nickelback's How You Remind Me.</div><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">Sneaking out of there,i went to the Masquerade and crashed it,fashionably late in /b/ style with 20 minutes left till they closed,spazzed out dancing and left like nothing.Played Super Smash Brothers Brawl in the game room for an hour then went to the Yuri Fest and enjoyed yuri hentai in its pixel glory,got spanked by a Yuri paddle.At this point,it was almost 2AM,so i headed into the hotel room and slept.</div><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Saturday and Sunday will be written eventually,just getting this out of the way!<br /><br />-Josh C</div>&nbsp;"

Anyway excuses aside,last week went by pretty smoothly.Not much to do since Tuesday to Thursday were a half days and Friday was a day off since everyone was getting ready for prom.It went better than i thought it would be.Got to be with my girl Amanda for four hours and all my friends,it was fun just dicking around all dressed up and everything,there were people that you'd think wouldnt look good in formal clothing....looking good in formal clothing XD.

It's been a month since we've been together and i'll admit,i'm stilling getting used to having a girlfriend,it has been awhile &gt;&gt;;.The phone calls,the chatting,the weekly visits,everything,shows how good i am in a relationship /sarcasm.But i love that girl,and she knows it

On that note,apparently if you tell people that you're going out with a asian girl,people wont believe unless you have a photograph and their signature. I might,keyword might,go out with Kim to the movies Saturday evening,if not,next Saturday.

What i'm doing this week,two tests for the Accuplacer Thursday and Friday,Saturday i have a police competition in the morning,and then maybe movies with Kim

Random thought,i always think about commanding like a small group of soldiers,divide them into three groups,one goes with me,second finds the girl and the other fights the enemy

Back in the day,i went under the name &quot;teamfast&quot; which was a group from an old N64 game and fell in love with the name for some reason or another

6 years ago,and i shit you not,i found out about a thing called e-mail and since it was the &quot;it&quot; thing,because everyone had one,i decide to make an account with yahoo mail.The thing was that teamfast@yahoo.com didnt have a good ring to it,so i actually had to spend a good while trying to come up with a good name

So after a good ten minutes or so,i came up with the name DJ illusion007,being that, at the time, i wanted to be a DJ (not anymore ^^;) and illusion sounded so bad ass and of course 007 because i am a James Bond fanboy,still to this day,so it became dj_illusion007

But over time,i dropped the DJ part and became illusion007. You'll know it's me since i'm the only person that goes under that name or if i wanna hide out and go under an alias,it becomes Kamikaze007 or illusion0069

Basically,me in a&nbsp;lab coat,with&nbsp;three&nbsp;Pikachus in my pocket (one in the breast pocket and&nbsp;two in&nbsp;the side&nbsp;pockets) and off course,the Giant Pikachu,and if possible,get a t-shirt that has a Pikachu on it.Can you say &quot;crapload of fangirls all over Pikachu?&quot;</li></ul>That's pretty much it,not much else going on today,just that&nbsp;it's the&nbsp;last day of school for 2009  Cheers  -Josh C &nbsp;"

"event","To put this bluntly,this weekend has been pretty.....hectic.There isnt any other way to sugar coat it. 

<lj-cut text=""The drama countines"">To make a long story sorta short and get a concept of what's happening,Sara had a boyfriend,who just happen to be my best friend who's relationship has been on the rocks for the last few months.I talk to Sara when i can and in span of a month,our feelings for one another kinda evolved into forbidden romance kinda thing (something that came out of a crappy romance novel or manga) 

We sneaked off when we can to be alone,just to kiss or hold hand,just to make her feel better,and all of this pretty much all behind his back.Publically I'm Switerzland between the two,private i'm more with Sara's side. Last week,they broke up,not because he found out about us but for reasons unknown,nor will i ask them why,again relationship on the rocks is probably why.My guess is that he went over to Jessica's side,making the whole thing into a love square,and it shows seriously,me and Sara hide it well since we dont have classes together while they do 

So anyway,they broke up,he took it in stride like nothing happen,cause he's with Jess now,while Sara is crying her eyes now.After looking for her during lunch,she was in the office waiting for her mom to come pick her up.I went over and hugged her,and told me that she was gonna commit suicide,she had to note ready and that there's no reason for her to live anymore. This is where the whole situation gets worse. That day she didnt talk on MSN (we always talk on it) nor did she get on Gaia or Myspace (it's sounds stalker-ish but i had to checkup on her somehow). Saturday I called her up that night to check up on her,she sounded down but alive.Sunday she went drinking,that was a pain,but she was still which matter the most

Monday,I didnt want to go to school,but i had to,the day was a drag,until i asked Steven if she was here,he said yes which got my hopes up.Lunch came around,i didnt see her at the usual hope which made me worried,until she came through the gates,so i went over to her
 and gave her a tight hug,telling her that she made me worried and that she scared me.She was alive and in my arms,i was happy that day.

Now,she's depressed but alive and still in school,grin and baring it basically. We're keeping our distance since it's too soon to do anything together. We might not even get together until she's ready or even at all,this happen so much,so fast. It sucks waiting,but what can you do?
</lj-cut>
That's pretty much the few time i'll be serious,and i'll replace this entry with a sightly happier one ^^;

There is no such thing as too much praying ^_^

anyway on a happier note,Snapple is getting used to us,and it's actually fun taking her out for walks,and she really love her walks,we go for about half hour or so and meet some nice people <strike>and cute girls </strike>

Anyway,back to reality,Thanksgiving Break has come and gone,it was quite relaxing for a week off,it doesnt seem like much but it relives some stress,like school,college,etc.Still,it was nice,didnt do much,just slept late and woke up late,played Halo 2 (360 still isnt working T_T),and pretty much talked to everyone i could,and Sara 

The week went by more or less fast with her,the constant trips to downtown to meet up with her,walking around,getting something to eat then going to the park to eat,normal stuff basically XD 

Thanksgiving was nice,for the first time in a long time,it was at my friend's house,instead at Mexico or Dallas.Being with the original three,Jesus,Bryan,and myself.It's funny that we all grew up so fast (Jesus is 20,Bryan is 19,and I'm 17) 

It's been a good week,but it's time to go back to work,so let's do our best! ^_^

anyway just making a quick journal entry like always.This week is our last week before we go off for Thanksgiving.w00t! But it's gonna be more or less busy week. Today,at this moment,our new dog Snapple is at the house,after a week of waiting,pretty sure the Chapman's are gonna miss her,but they should know that she's going to a great home

It's gonna be a little tough since our house is not as spacious as her previous home,and with Missy in the same house with her,it's gonna be a little tricky,even more so since Snapple is a indoor dog.

I dont know,everyone is gonna have to pull their weight in order to take care of her,but we're gonna do okay hopefully

I'm gonna edit this later tonight when i get back from school and see how Snapple is doing

When i said this week had it's ups,i'd tell ya,but it's little too embarassing to tell you what happen during gym&nbsp;^^;.Another up is that i told a girl that i liked her,and this time it didnt go to hell like it did with Jessica,but the bad thing is that she's my best friend's girlfriend so its ackward,but least she knows, and she didnt seem to mind really

Now i can sleep better at night! XD&nbsp;lulz

Monday,i'm gonna start going to college everyday until November 18,my mom's teacher says it's ok as long as i dont find the class boring,which it isnt! How often do you find a Vietnamese girl in San Antonio,some awesome roommates,and a very nice Cuban chick all in one room? Not every often eh?

Give someone a month of Xbox Live,or better yet,give them a year of Xbox Live.&nbsp;Julian,he's a awesome guy T_T,gave me a year's worth of Xbox Live,out of the blue for free! I almost cried &gt;&gt;;.You will get sucked in the worth of online gaming,so much that you wont have sex or even....do stuff by yourself. A month did that for me,but a year? Oh Lordy XD

Holy Crap EDIT!

Apparently they took out videogame day and Ninja Vs Pirate day and replaced with Twin Day and Western&nbsp;Day (both stupid really).Cruz is pissed cause she had everything set to cosplay as Misty,so she's petitioning the petition to replace them back.Let's see how that goes,though i wouldnt be suprised that most people dont take part because what happen. &gt;&gt;"

"event","&nbsp;Day 0 (Thursday)- I arrived at the hotel at around 12:15PM to help out with setting up and stuff ,The first thing they assigned me to do is to put swag on the bags,all 1,000 of them (or it seem like that many&nbsp;XD). With the help of eight other people,it took us about two hours to complete them all. When that was over,most people left to help at the dealer's room except for me and a few other people stayed to clean up the room under Proz's orders,doing so we found some swag from last year,so we kept a few. Looking for something to do,we headed to the auditorium &nbsp;and helped around the dealer's room.&nbsp;While putting up manga on the shelves ,this girl Jasmine, was talking about sex and dildos with the other girls in our group,one of the guys who was helping said&nbsp;&quot;Man,I'm a pervert but I dont wanna listen to this&quot;.They kept it up until Barb came around and told them to get back to work. <div style=""text-align: left; "">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We then helped out a Japanese couple putting up cages,and met this really cute girl helping us out,but she was 21 though,we even had a race on who can make a 5x5 cage first without screwing up (she won),so we made a few more cages till they told us when. Around 5PM, Barb told us to go on a lunch break,so I went with the group I was with,back to the hotel and got something off the kid's menu.I only had enough money for the bus fare,so i didnt buy anything but they did give me some fries.After awhile one of the volunteers told us that the badges wont come in till 8PM,so I told Barb that I was gonna leave and get the badge tomorrow morning,she said it was ok,I left,said goodbye to everyone amd went home.</div><br />Day 1 (Friday)-I'll admit,I overslept,waking up around 9:47AM. Ate,showered quickly to go to the bus stop and arrived at the hotel around 10:34AM.&nbsp;I&nbsp;got my badge from Barb and went to where my boss,Mr Hicks was at,between the hotel and the auditorium For doing nothing but pass out wate,it was alot of fun.Me and Mr Hicks would try to get people's attention by playing some music on my phone and yelling out &quot;Water! Ice cold free water.....did i mention that it's free?&quot; &quot;Aqua tu quieres aqua?Chiclets?&quot; &quot;You're hot ma'am,would you like some water?&quot; and it worked! Saw some pretty interesting cosplays,met a few people from the forums,hell even gave water to one of the members to the LeetStreet Boys and offered some to Travis! A few breaks later,at around 7pm,I told Hicks that i had to leave,so i left and waited for tomorrow to come<br /><br />Day 2&nbsp;(Saturday)- Woke up pretty damn early after 6 hours of sleep,got ready.went to the bus stop and arrived around 9:33 AM,I signed up for the Otakulympics the other day(i picked America!&nbsp;Fuck yeah!),for the third time,and waited till around 10PM to get ready for the prelims. Overall i got third place,i was with a great team,who did a awesome job in the pose off and the iron cosplay,making a Chrono Trigger cosplay out of cloth and duct tape,it was the hot dog eating contest that screwed me over,and i was hungry too,but oh well,it still kicked ass,much more than last year.Headed back to the hotel,looking for everyone from Laredo,and found George in the game room,and said that everyone got there around the time i went to the Otakulympics. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When i was about to walk to the auditorium,Kathy found me first at the front of the hotel,then i caught up with everyone,Yvonne,Mazel,Chinchi,and Freddy,except for Freddy everyone was cosplaying (cause he's too cool to cosplay).Basically we spent most of the time walking around the convention,attend the Yoshida concert.and go to the dealer's room.Overall it was a pretty good time,but as always,i dont know what to say to them because i'm a little shy around them ^^; but it's always good to see them here in town.Around 6PM they had to head back to Laredo,so they left,it sucked but here's hoping&nbsp; that we'll see each other again soon ^^.After they left,i pretty much spent the whole time at the AMV&nbsp;room watching,well,AMVs.Once that was over,i went to the hotel room,got some food,and left at around 8PM<br /><br />Day 3&nbsp;(Sunday)-After church and breakfast,and lots of begging,my mom allowed me to go to the convention for the last day.Arriving around 11:45AM. It was pretty much laid back.Mr Hicks told me to pick up the voucher if i was gonna head to the dealer's room,because they were gonna close early.So i went to the hotel,found Barb,and she gave the a voucher worth $25,which is really sweet,after about..16 hours of work.So I went back to where Mr Hick was at which is near the auditorium and not between like Friday,so we got a bit more shade.Basically it was the same as Friday,still fun,just not alot of people because it was the last day and all.Around 4PM,Mr Hicks told me that it's pretty much over and that he was gonna wrap everything up,and told me to enjoy the remaining time left,so i head to the dealer's room to make use of the voucher,and met up with George. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He told me that to hurry up and go to the dealer's room,when i got there,there was this mean lady guarding the door and said that the dealer's room was closed,and wasnt letting anyone in.I told her that i didnt know that it was gonna close that early and to let me in but she wouldnt let me.Looking at George,he shrugged and said &quot;Sorry bro&quot;,a little pissed about what happen,I saw one of the volunteers from Thursday named Linda in the dealer's room.I told her about what happen and&nbsp;that she should take the voucher and make use of it since i couldnt,she said &quot;Oh no! I couldnt! After working out in the sun for a long time,you deserved it!&quot; and so we're trying to come up with something and there was another person blocking the door to the dealer's room and so i told him if i could go in and didnt know that it was gonna close early because i was out helping Hicks passing out water to everyone,but the guy didnt know what to do so i bluntly told him that Linda was my mom,and that i wanted to be with her and so the guy said if it's true and Linda said &quot;oh yeah that's my son right there&quot;,and so he was like &quot;oh ok,go ahead&quot;. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First thing i was hug Linda,cause holy crap she's a friggin life saver and the awesome con mom ever! Then asked if she was gonna be at the convention again next year again,and she said yes,so it would be awesome to see her again next year.&nbsp;After awhile,i got a Penpen plushie and a grab bag full of pocky and ramane drinks,which isnt so bad for $25,though you have to spend the voucher all in one place.I&nbsp;saw George again and told what happen and that i manage to get in,he was happy and left. Spent the last hour of the convention at the AMV&nbsp;room,watching the same AMV from yesterday,and met up with Mr Hicks who said that he's happy how the Water Ninjas did and he was honored to have me working under him&nbsp;^^;. Went outside for awhile and saw Tony,the host of the Otakulympics,he said that since i've been at all three events that i could be a judge for the next one,we exchanged numbers and he left. Headed to the hotel room to grab something to eat.There was a crap load of bread in the room,so ate that. Alot of the volunteers entered,including George,hanged out,got something to eat,and talked about random things. One of the volunteers got this game called Ninja Burger,so we all played that and got our asses kicked by George.We played again,but i had to leave so i left and said good bye to &nbsp;everyone.Then things got back to normal sadly<br /><br />Holy friggin crap,after two weeks,and losing all the work once. It's done! T_T I know there's alot more but fuck it,let's leave it at what's here and nothing more&nbsp;XD<br /><br />Thank the Lord man.<br /><br />-Josh C<br /><br />Quote of the Day&nbsp;<br />&quot;Buttscratcher!&quot;&nbsp;<br />-Everywhere at the convention<br /><br />&quot;It's like Yasu is making love to the camera!&quot;<br />-Me telling Kathy about how Yasu moves in the concert videos"

Last week of school ended (to me) with a whimper instead of a bang,there wasnt much to do except the finals and talking till the bell rang.As soon as the bell rang,i just head where Jose,Ryan,Steven,and Cruz are at,under the big tree. I wanted to avoid alot of people and head straight to the people that matters most to me.Sit down for awhile,mess with Cruz by tickling her with some type of grass and talk for a bit.

Speaking about girls,that &quot;date&quot; with Jessica? Never happened.Nor did she even call me to tell me that she couldnt go or anything.Nada.In the end,we've stopped talking.But these things happen,so what can you do?

Now i'm in summer school,and in about a week of being in it,i'm half way done with the work they gave me,but it's alot harder so i'll be done in about 2-3 weeks.Also! I&nbsp;got my report card and pass all my classes for the second semster! It sucked that i failed Ms Ng the first semster and that i'm a few credits short,but it's okay,and that's why i got summer school.Here's hoping for the class of 2010.

Sora:if you're reading this,i'm sorry i forgot telling you &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;! Time went by pretty quick.But anyway.Hope you had a good one,and try sending me a drawing of Roy Mustang if you want it autographed when San Japan rolls around!

Sorta &gt;&gt;.I just call it a small get together with Jessica,plus she's thinking about it too,so my chances are slim,but hey,it's better than nothing.Hell it was nerve wracking just having the guts to ask her.

I mean,she's going through alot right now,the whole break up with Carlos,then suddenly getting with another girl within a day or so,then having to see them all lovey dovey in front of her,it's pretty much sucks.So that's why i'm asking her out,so she can clear her head of the current situtation,and want her to be happy,even if it's for one day.

One small problem to this are Isreal and Carlos.Since Jessica knew about me liking her,they always try to force just to kiss each other or just push us into each other,which makes the whole thing a bit ackward.Now they're telling me that they'll arrange the whole get together with Jessica.Ha,fuck no.I rather do this thing all on my own (apparently going around downtown and in River Center Mall isnt good enough)

I dont know,i dont care anymore that if she has feelings for me or not,i just want her happy.

I'll let y'all know how that goes.

It's good to see them (even though it was for a few hours &gt;&gt;),being that i havent seen them since October.<br /><br />Might go to O-Conn,even though George told me it might suck,good to go to another anime convention and be Professor Tree again<br /><br />Speaking of which! I&nbsp;have a cosplay,he's a OC&nbsp;to the Pokemon universe called Professor Tree,since i couldnt think of a tree,i just went with that.It's just me in a lab coat,and my school uniform,and a giant Pikachu&nbsp;(which got me about six pictures taken,and a few hugs ^_^)<br /><br />Also,my Happy House of Hentai shirt came in,i havent talked about the podcast,but it's really awesome.They talk about the latest in hentai.Look up the shirt,if you want to,buy it,it's five bucks for a limitied time.<br /><br />On a random note,i keep thinking about stuff alot,mainly girls&nbsp;(<strike>maybe cause i've been single for almost three months now</strike>) but i should really focus on school more now,shit i passed the third nine weeks but i barely passed Algebra 2 with a 71,gotta work on that.<br /><br /><br />That's all i got,i'm gonna be out of the country for Easter (i really dont wanna go &gt;&gt;)<br /><br />Love and Peace y'all<br /><br />-Josh C<br /><br /><br /><br />"

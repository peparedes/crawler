"event","Sometimes you wonder whether to go to see a film adaptation of a book for fear that they'll have ruined it, particularly when the book in question is a Hugo and Nebula award winner.

Sometimes, however, such fears can be confounded and they do a stonkingly good adaptation, relatively minor and fairly innocuous liberties with fine details of the story, sensitive cutting and abridging to accommodate the limitations of the medium, a distinct lack of a significant attempt to shy away from some of the darker aspects of the source and plenty of direct quotables for those who actually know the book and have a good memory. (Perhaps this was one occasion when having the original author as one of the executive producers has been a really good thing.)

If you haven't already guessed which book I'm referring to from the title of this post already I'll spell it out as clearly as possible. If you read and liked Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, you might want to give the film a try, I really don't think you'll be disappointed."

"event","Well, it&#39;s been a while since I posted anything here so this&#39;ll probably come as a surprise to some of you so do try not to drop dead of shock. <lj-cut text=""Anyway..."">Anyway...

As those who attended this year&#39;s CON may or may not have noticed, given I lugged it all the way down, rode it exactly once and then lugged it all the way back again, I&#39;ve started cycling regularly again. It&#39;s been the only thing that has, more or less, made work, which is programming yet again, something I still seem to hate with a passion, borderline bearable. Well, that and, you see, I have this mad inclination to try riding l&#39;etape next year so I&#39;ve really got to get some proper training in this year.

Just by way of background I should note that although my house is still north of Manchester, my job is near Stroud in Gloucestershire, not the most ideal of situations as it involves a weekly commute, rented accomodation and other assorted double bills. The company itself might be full of lovely people and have a great atmosphere, there was even Champagne and a break to watch the Olympic torch go by, but I&#39;m afraid I still wait with breathless anticipation for the end of my one year contract at the beginning of August, it&#39;s probably wrong to be looking forward to being unemployed again, but hey, such is my life.

Work stresses aside, the consolation is that that bit of the Cotswolds does have the benefit of being lumpy from a cycling point of view; the 4 mile ride in to work has about 100m of climbing to it and the ride home, usually rather indirectly 21 miles via Gloucester, has some further climbing and then the consolation of a couple of miles of pure downhill fun, that&#39;d be 40mph of fun according to my recently acquired cycling computer. So all in all, at the moment I&#39;ve able to put in about 100 miles during the working week and then get in a weekend run up the Cat and Fiddle near my parents back North for another 20 or 30 miles depending upon route. The Cat and Fiddle (400m or so of ascent) is kind of useful as, although it&#39;s not awfully steep, it&#39;s quite a long climb so I believe it would normally be classified as a Cat. 1 climb for races. We&#39;ll gloss over the fact that I probably need to be able to do my C. &amp; F. loop five times consecutively to realistically be vaguely l&#39;etape ready so there&#39;s obviously still a lot of work to do.

There are also one or two &#39;interesting&#39; hills down near work, I discovered one by accident on a longer evening run home from work, about 30 indirect miles, this time via Cirencester. The hill in question from Brockworth up to Birdlip has, on the OS map, a couple of single arrow sections, that&#39;s a gradient of between 1:7 and 1:5 for those not in the know. What the OS map neglected to inform me was that, at least from my percieved level of trauma going up it, the rest of the hill is probably only just under 1:7 too, and over a mile of that is just plain unpleasant for climbing lardy-pusses like me.

So where&#39;s this wandering and rambling tale of my cycling exploits going. Well, the aforementioned cycling computer was the new tool for me to better judge whether I&#39;d made a foolish decision. The foolish decision in question was signing up for an organised bike ride on bank holiday Monday. The ride I&#39;d signed up for required me to be able to manage an average of 18mph for 52 miles and, at least historically, that&#39;s not the speed at which I used to get anywhere on my old mountain bike. However, it turned out that, now that I actually had measurements, I was in for a reasonably pleasant surprise, my speed on the flatter sections of the home run each night through Gloucester were hovering nicely around the required speed and although my average cadence wasn&#39;t quite where I&#39;d like it to be it was closer to the desirable range than I had expected, so I was actually reasonably reassured that I hadn&#39;t been completely mad.

So, at ridiculous o&#39;clock on Monday morning I was setting out for the center of Manchester to ride 52 miles on closed roads, yep, the organisers http://www.greatcycle.org had managed to arrange closed roads for the ride that pretty much blocked any easy north south passage through the city for vehicles. Not that I cared, &#39;cause I&#39;d eventually be on them on my bike. Start was at about 8am and I finished in just over 2hrs 43 minutes with pretty consistent lap times. So in summary, for my first ever sportive ride, I had an absolute blast and just in case you hadn&#39;t guessed yet, that rider in the icon of this GIP, that&#39;s me.

"event","Oh dear... , oh dear... , oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, Tron Legacy. 

I had always suspected from first seeing trailers that this was probably not a wise film to see if you'd loved the original and I really wasn't going with terribly high expectations, but honestly, did the makers actually even watch the original before making this horror. I can't believe I actually shelled out cash and stayed up till past midnight last night (yes, I might be a bit of an obsessive cinema goer) to see it.

I suppose accusing the makers of not seeing the original is perhaps a little unkind as there are a couple of direct quote lifts in there, perhaps in a vain attempt to mollify fans of the original, but beyond that we're back to oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, particularly if (though this might be a little unrealistic) you expect some world consistency between the original and this sequel abomination. And while we're on the subject of consistency is it asking too much to ask that the film try to even maintain its own internal consistency? (if you go to see it, and I say if advisedly, just consider, as an obvious example, the arrival, departure and some of the explicatory dialog in between related to the 'portal' and then hit 'does-not-compute'.)

The film also very definitely exemplifies the observation that you cannot make up for a poor story, and trust me it is poor, cliched and derivative, with flashy effects and action sequences. By the time it makes its mind up about what it's going to be about other than action sequences we have the shoe-horned 'what human atrocity can we nod to here' in an attempt to lend moral weight - fail. Family story - fail, at least from my point of view as I did not find the protagonist particularly likable. Love interest - fail and grrrr, no, no, no! Furthermore, the result of the inappropriately inserted action/effects/buckets-of-dice sequences detracts further because the result is lumpy, uneven, disjointed pacing with no real rhyme or reason to it other than 'oh should we stuff another action sequence in here'. 

Oh, and on the subject of effects, as a note to the effects artists, rather wasted now they've done the bloody thing, I would like to point out that since we are in a digital world here you do not need reaction based propulsion. If you had thought about this a bit you might have realised this - therefore your redesigned 'recognisers' (you know to what I refer if you are a true Tron geek) do not need jets in their feet, they may float like U.F.O.s quite happily. I may, however, concede you one point, I quite liked your geometric fireworks, but some of my friends might argue I'm prejudiced on that front. However, I am not sure that I am prepared to pay for the DVD so that I can freeze frame and identify the stellations used in the quickly fading parts of the shell explosions, I think the majority were stelations of the icosahedron, after all there are plenty of those to choose from, but there might have been at least one that was the second of the dodecahedron, but they passed rather too quickly to identify precisely. 

My initial complaint on seeing the trailers, that for a 'Tron' film the props were too real world still stands, it ought to look rather more otherworldly and alien, but that may just be prejudice carried over from the limitations of the first film's, at the time, groundbreaking C.G. However, I think the complaint stands in that it didn't really seem to be trying to look 'other'.

So if you see me in the next few weeks over the festive season, please do not mention this film, it will only start me ranting, alternatively if you do go and see it and want to join in the rant fest please feel free.

I suspect the next film that I will probably be going to see with the overtly critical eye of the loved-the-original, assuming it's not a hoax, is the Reboot film, though, if it is real, and there aren't enough C.G./I.T. jokes in the scenery I will be complaining again, bitterly."

Just had to move my stored stuff from one storage location to another and this is where the problem lies, in moving the stuff I've just found out that someone else has already been in it and have rifled through it. Perhaps inevitably therefore, there are a number of things obviously missing, my two aging consoles Dreamcast and GameCube have gone awol and whoever took them also took the time to rummage through everything until they found the games to go with them, my decent mountain bike has also disappeared, which is the thing I'm probably most upset about. Also the general turning upside down of things has resulted in things now missing the odd piece that make them usable. My Tantrix set is now missing two pieces, I have a set of runes that is now a rune down. How much else has actually disappeared I won't finally know until I finish the house and can move in and unpack things properly.

"event","Well I sort of dropped off the face of the world again, there'd be a reason for that. Yes I know this is long, but I'm leaving it uncut because I think some of this has been absolutely fascinating and deserves to be shared, yes, I know that's a vanity.

Towards the end of February my specialist decided that it was safe for me to start taking the medication upon which I will be dependent for the rest of my life. After picking up my first month's supply and having a moping evening out at the cinema wondering whether I was worth the cost of the medication I started taking the tablets. 

Now I knew that there was a possibility of side effects whilst starting, they pack you off with anti-emetics and anti-diarrhea medication at the same time as you pick up the medication so I was pleasantly surprised that I seemed to be having no noticeable adverse reaction to the drugs. After about six days I got a call from my father asking if I could go up and visit to help with my mother's current disposition so I headed up north and was joking with them that evening that I was going to have to complain bitterly to my specialist about the lack of side effects. Funnily enough, I had a sleepless night that night, didn't actually sleep at all, just tossed and turned in bed all night, so felt slightly tired the following day, not drowsy mind, no inkling of the possibility of sleep perfectly wide awake, so 24hrs awake and I go to bed expecting to go to sleep having not slept.

Nope, not a jot of it, another night wide awake, now I've done university/been a programmer, I know the essay/code crisis, working all night, I know what it's like after a couple of nights with no sleep, after 36hrs awake you should be getting those little jerks as you drop into microsleep as tiredness catches up with you, where were these, they were'nt occurring, I was tired, awake for 36hrs and stark staring awake, surely I'd sleep that night. Errm, actually no, another night of no sleep whatsoever and my appetite is up the spout too, it was a chore to eat even a small amount of meals.

To cut a long story marginally shorter, six, yes that's right six days after the start of this I still haven't slept for a single hours and I'm still wide awake, tired and feeling as weird as hell, no appetite and I need to return to Oxford for my two week post starting medication consultation with my specialist. Perhaps understandably my parents refused to let me drive and my father drove me down. That night we'd brought lasagne which could be microwaved for ease after our journey, now I enjoy lasagne, but my appetite and taste was so thrown that I managed a single bite and spat it out as to me it tasted disgusting, I was sort of subsisting on fruit juice and what little dinners I can force down at this point. Day seven (sleep what's sleep) and I see my sepecialist and list my problems, mention I think I've lost a little weight, I had, over a stone to be precise, was reassured by the fact that some of the things like my changed taste were well known temporary side-effects of one of the drugs that would pass presently and was referred to the pharmacist for suggestions about the more serious sleep problem, people who don't sleep tend to go mad you see, she had two things for me to try to allow me to sleep and I'd be back in two weeks if it didn't work out when we could consider changing the drug combination. My father drove me back home to my parents and that night I tried the first of the suggestions, no joy, if you've been keeping track you'll note that we are now at a grand total of 8 days without a wink or inkling of sleep, though the fish and chips for the meal that night did actually taste a bit like you'd expect fish and chips to taste. So the next night I tried the second suggestion, to miss one dose of the suspect drug taking it instead 12hrs late (the drug is one of the few in it's class to cross the blood-brain barrier, I'd been specifically interested in that one when choosing from my options for it's reputation to give interesting dreams, alas unbeknownst to me insomnia is another one of its possible listed side effects). Success, finally after 8 days without any sleep whatsoever I finally managed to sleep that night. Things have improved steadily since then, the quality of sleep has improved and for some reason the depression and low that I seem to have been suffering previously was gone, completely and utterly as if turned off at a switch, I'm actually able to concentrate on work at the moment and am having a reasonable degree of success as a freelance IT consultant. Right now some seven weeks after starting I'm not really having any side effects to the medication at all, just like the literature says, 4-6 weeks of hell after you start and then it all settles down.

Now before you all start hugsing and poor you-ing about this, a) it's done and passed, I'm fine now, just fingers crossed the drugs are doing what they're supposed to, b) the state of mind you get into after 6-8 days of complete sleep deprivation is interesting to say the least, that probably coupled with a drug that I suspect can blur the line between dreaming, lucid dreaming and in my case it would seem waking consciousness means you're not bored whilst lying in bed in the dark not being able to sleep. Just take your pick: do you want to surf through the mind space of your memories, pick and watch and freeze frame what you like; probe and expose action and consequence in exquisite detail; probe the secrets of the universe and end up having what can only be described as a (semi-)spiritual experience; have such perfect control of your mind's eye, ear that you can produce film quality visuals, fully orientable sculpture and compose full orchestral music just by thinking about it. Maybe that last was a brief but fascinating insight into the way the minds of the great visionaries and composers produce their masterpieces, perhaps just a brief glimpse of the source of genius. Well to me it seemed to explain to my satisfaction how someone such as Beethoven could still produce masterpieces despite his later deafness, there is no need for hearing when a flute sounds as a flute in the ensemble to your mind's internal ear.

It was in many respects a fascinating experience if unpleasant during the day, you feel so very weird, spaced out, not yourself, detached, you watch yourself doing things though you are doing those things of your volition. It's given me an insight into why sleep deprivation is an effective method of torture and coercion, because as fascinating as my experiences were I desperately wanted it to stop, it wasn't a pleasant experience. At the point I was leaving messages to the GM's on Patchwork Universe to make them aware of my plight it was only partly the courtesy and partly to have contact and get replies from people outside my immediate surroundings because at that point I wasn't entirely sure whether I was alive or dead and in some kind of afterlife and for some reason external replies from friends I know seemed a more reassuring thing to prove I was alive, yes, I know that's technically flawed logic, I could still be dead and in an afterlife that's clever enough to send the right sort of reply. So in summary weird, unpleasant, but I don't think I'd have missed it for anything, I almost wish I could do it again, I must be mad! And from a vanity point of view even the weight loss hasn't been all bad, my muscle definition was showing much more with less to hide it, I almost had a proper six-pack, shame I'm putting the weight back on again, hmm, must get to the gym.

In other news, finally looks like I've managed to sell the millstone hanging round my neck which is also a relief."

But the fact remains I actually seem to be getting some stuff done today, this hasn't happened in a long time.

Sad isn't it.

If you're wondering why he looks so grumpy it's probably down to the fact that the nurse who did the last round of perforations was thoroughly incompetent about it, okay I suppose the bruises could have been bigger but... That aside, I'm currently having some nasty suspicions about the coincidence of upcoming birthdays and my incipient dependence on medication with all it's wonderful starting side effects.

In slightly happier news <a href=""http://www.siliconhenge.com/patchwork"">Patchwork Universe</a> is continuing to amuse, though seems to have been getting out of hand occasionally. People, you are going to have to tell me when you find my narrative becoming tiresome because I do seem to keep wittering on.

I've also been back on Silver for the first time in quite a while. I'd had rather to much can't-be-arsed to put the new tax disc on from the point it expired at the end of July and by the time I did get round to putting it on, Silver's alarm had killed Silver's battery so after getting a new one, battery that is, cleaning, lubricating and generally being nice to Silver I took him out for a spin. First time back on (okay it was in the dark and rain) he was a little skittish, second ride out much better, amazing how fast it comes back.

Hmm, must get out and see people or have people visit again after having had a couple of tied up weekends. House still not sold, but getting a few more carpet treaders at the moment, still no offers le-sigh, the money pit continues to gnaw.

Next great plan of many tiny stages, trying to get my life back on track, hmm, this could be a tricky one.

Right bored now, that's your lot for a bit."

"event","Well not much has been happening in <lj user=""two_nukes""> world for a bit, for which I actually only have myself to blame, though I did spend a bit of last Friday night lying out watching the Perseids.

Still not got over the last job so I'm 'happy' to let my money piddle out through the mortgage for the moment, should really be trying to get a house sale moving but everything is really too much effort.

Hmm, how true is that 'not got over' bit, it's increasingly sounding like a glib excuse for not wanting to work, for being too lazy to try, am I really just throwing a tantrum because the world won't conveniently drop into my lap. I know I'm letting things slide, not been to the gym in weeks, not seeing friends, probably not really looking after myself properly but I don't seem to be able to do anything about it. I can objectively look at the behavior and see that I'm being silly though my choice of self description in my mind is normally a trifle more colourful. 

I'm still plagued by his bloody question too, I'm not sure I have the complete answer to it but I think part of it is that I desperately need a purpose, a justification, a reason, especially now, and I'm really not sure the potentiality of what you might achieve counts unless you actually have something worthwhile that you're trying to achieve in the first place. What is there to set against my cost, my choices.

Oh <lj user=""two_nukes""> I see what you're doing, walls and distance, put up the signs, don't touch, don't speak, keep away. Retreating and comforting yourself with unreal fantasies. So easy to turn you back and walk away, so tempting, just like last time, yet this time there's a little sting in that tail. You built yourself that prison, denied yourself those dreams of walking out into another more exciting world if the opportunity arose. You fulfilled your own vision of idiocy, you f*@kwit, why? gave yourself a choice that should never have to be made.

I saw a meme go past in another journal where the last question was whether you'd rather have a million 'bucks' or go back in time and fix your mistakes. The respondent very sensibly followed the line that whilst there are things that might have been done differently, who was to say what actually defined a mistake. It's true we're a product of our pasts, the moving hand an' all. It's a djinn's wish to fix all your mistakes, there'd be nothing to stop you repeating them, shame, I have a list of one or two that could do with patching."

"event","Well that's it you lucky, lucky people, I'm back in the UK after two weeks of storm chasing across Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and briefly Colorado, just so <lj user=""lanfykins""> doesn't get too envious I didn't manage to see any tornados, funnel clouds on a couple of occasions but no official tornado touchdowns, though I did get to see some very recently caused tornado damage. However, that's not to say that the break didn't have its moments, being grilled by US immigration for a hour or so upon arrival, the actually chasing when storms were available to chase, some of the most spectacular lightning shows I have ever had the pleasure to witness.

Oh yes, on the subject of US immigration, they're going to kill me if they find out, concerned as they seemed to be by my honesty about the fact that I was recently unemployed and therefore must be coming over to steal jobs from deserving Americans, I seem to have returned with a job offer. Assuming that the group I booked my holiday with get some funding and sponsorship I have an offer to join them writing data acquisition software for the sensors they'll be carrying next year and also helping with the design and build of the sensor packages. So, thinking about it, if that were to work out and I survive the potential minefield that will be trying to get myself a working visa for the States then it could be that next year I'll actually be being paid to chase tornados for the entire season. Coo, getting paid for two months of tornado chasing, let's just watch <lj user=""lanfykins""> turn green with envy for a bit shall we! 

Of course this could all be a bust if the funding/visa doesn't turn up but hey, ho, it's an avenue that's opened to me into something that's both worthwhile and interesting, fulfilling two major criteria for a job I'd feel like I might be able to hack. So even if I am just clutching at straws at the moment they're very nice straws, stuck in tornado ravaged telegraph poles."

"event","What a bloody bust, I suspect sabotage, the CBB is not making itself any friends here.

Yesterday I was in London to collect the elusive video camera that I'm after after failing to be able to get hold of it by mail order. So I walked down to the shop and asked about it, 'oh', said the assistant, 'I thought you were going to call during the week to confirm when you were going to collect it, I haven't brought it into the shop.' Grrr, I thought I'd been pretty clear the previous Saturday that I was going to be in London this Saturday to pick it up, oh well, next week it is then, I'm down in London again sorting out my passport renewal in any case. Is it just paranoia, but I'm starting to wonder how that could possibly go wrong on me, hmm, has my appearance changed enough for me to get clobbered by them not believing I'm me?

I had been a little late getting into London because I'd stopped off in Wallingford earlier to buy some paint, you see my favorite ex-gymnast paints so I thought it'd be a nice little surprise to buy him some paints since when last I saw him a number of tubes were getting a little flat. Now since I was in London, if perhaps now a little unsuccessfully, I thought I'd try to winkle him out of his flat for dinner and surprise him with his pressies. I dropped him a call and got his voicemail, left a message and settled down and had some tea while I waited, and waited, and waited some more, and nothing, so in the end I ended up having dinner alone. I'm hoping he replies at some point during the week and currently just assuming he hasn't picked up his messages for some reason, ah well there's always next weekend, I hope. Why does that seem to be a persistent refrain at this point.

I suppose I should have realised the way the day was going to go before I got on the train after accidentally prodding the wrong button on the automatic ticket machine and getting a single rather than return, making the travel excessively expensive for the day as well."

"event","Yes, I thought this might be a problem and I think it's more than likely that we're going to have to have a bit of a talk. I do hope we can straighten this out, ex-gymnasts &lt;drool/&gt; don't grow on trees you know, but unfortunately this is one of those 'pretty fundamentals' and 'the rational <lj user=""two_nukes"">' is still more than capable of overriding body lust.

Le sigh, but at least I can console myself that it's not the end of the world, for it seems, as unlikely as I might find it, that I have my charms. Now if only I could add some social skills I might be in with a fighting chance.

Vanity, it's a funny thing to be appealed to. My ex-gymnast thinks I have a dancer's body and ought to try it, I'd have thought it's a bit late for that sort of thing and I am <i>so</i> not flexible enough. Wonder how fixable that is and how fast. 

Funny times for the <lj user=""two_nukes""> at the moment, I'm really quite broken in some ways. I want (need) to change but don't really know what I want to do (barring the usual dreams of living a playboy lifestyle with no  dependency on hard work). I so envy people who are engaged by their profession, what's the magic ingredient, how do you find it? 

In a very big way I suppose I'm looking for my meaning and worth, and yes, I know some people might have views on that sort of thinking. Also, I suppose I'm really just being unrealistic, the things that I want to 'play' with where you don't have to care whether they work in the end or not are always going to have to start as a hobby with something else to support them. Why do my dreams always seem to require so much capital outlay or skills and knowledge I don't have. 

I'm also just so very, very tired. Rather tritely, my get-up-and-go has got up and gone and that's probably my biggest problem, with a bit of enthusiasm I could fix those knowledge and skill shortcomings and actually <i>do</i> something."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Cut for excessive rambling"">Last Saturday I headed into London with the intention of finding shops that had the two camcorders I was potentially interested in purchasing in stock. Not that I was likely to buy, mailorder normally turns them up cheaper but I really wanted to get my hands on real physical objects to see what they were like from an ergonomic point of view. The disadvantage of this is that it exposes you to other camcorders that are available that you hadn't intended to look at because they were above your intended budget. This wouldn't have been as much of a problem if the two original candidates hadn't felt quite so dreadful, really quite astonishingly dreadful, and the more expensive camera which has better features and performance hadn't felt quite as right as it did with the controls falling much more comfortably and naturally to my hands. Oh dear, poor <lj user=""two_nukes"">' finances.

Then, not having had an entirely successful day regarding my browsing, I started feeling a bit miserable and vacillated between going home in a fit of pique and having dinner in town followed by going off to a club and perhaps meet up with a few friends as a result. Eventually the latter won out, but since sandals are perhaps not the best clubbing footwear I ended up looking for something more appropriate. This too was almost completely abortive due to the lateness of the hour and almost drove me home again, but a last minute success alleviated my despond and I settled myself in Balan's cafe for dinner. The meal was nice but not the notable thing about the dining experience, which was to have someone randomly hit on me while I was eating. Completely unexpected but very satisfying to the ego. I think I'll blame that turn of events on the fact that I was wearing some of the stuff from my shopping last week. Okay so I admit my vanity was appealed to and clubbing plans were slightly modified to take into account this unexpected interest.

Now I'm sure you think you know where this narrative is going by now, and are probably hoping I stop before we get to TMI, how wrong you are. As the evening drew on my surprise interest became increasingly drunk and increasingly obnoxious so in the end he got packed off onto a bus home. This did have the disadvantage of leaving me marooned in central London at half past one in the morning, inconveniently late enough that getting home is impossible and imposing on friends or getting to the club that they'd be at becomes a tricky proposition. This left me, I thought, in the same situation as last summer, decamping to a cafe till morning trains, and indeed I did scrape up the last change in my wallet which was sufficient for a small coffee that I nursed for a considerable period of time.

There is, however, one further possibility open to a frustrated person stranded in London. I had been discounting it as a possibility as I didn't have a written note of where I needed to get to. However, what I hadn't counted on was the reliability of my memory from having looked the place up in the A-to-Z previously, I surprised myself. Therefore, a new plan was hatched. The first stage of the plan involved getting cash to replenish my funds. This was easier said than done, there seemed to be a problem with my bank's computer systems at the time as I got quite a lot of 'service currently unavailable' messages and I think I even killed a couple of cash machines attempting to perform transactions using them, at least they closed down to faults immediately after returning my card. In the end I had to resort to using my credit card to get cash, grrr, cash advance charges! However, this did allow me to progress to stage two of the plan walking and finding the place, not problems with this one. I recall noting to myself, as I crossed, how quiet the middle of the Thames was compared to the traffic noise and police sirens you get in the city. I finally got myself to where I recalled I needed to get to and looked for the place, initially no joy but taking stock, I was absolutely convinced I was in the right place, I spotted the entrance. Inside and the wonderful ability to relax soaking in warm water with drinks available at the bar, actually a remarkably pleasant way to pass the hours to morning. However my morning plans to return home were rather unexpectedly derailed, look it wasn't my intention to get picked up, it was an accident, I'd already had my vanity assuaged once that evening, but it happened and there are some gift horses you really just do not look in the mouth, and that was Sunday. 

Since there's already an atmosphere of smugness permeating LJ from another direction I really don't think I need to add to it in this journal, besides early days. 

Dumb luck, fate, a caution, you can read too much into a series of events, hindsight will always find meaning in randomness and I have no reason to employ it, for once lets try to have a go at letting go and going with the flow without quite so much second guessing and analysis.</lj-cut>"

"event","Oh yes couple of things I neglected to mention in the previous update. Firstly during the boiler fiasco I ended up helping to lug the old one outside. This wouldn't have been a problem but for the fact that old and ancient boilers are built to last and as such are extremely heavy objects. Now, the important thing to remember about lugging such old and ancient boilers about is to avoid wrenching your lower back, umm... I'm currently periodically resorting to hot water bottles and ibuprofen at the moment. Still training though, and apparently my form is nice and strict at the moment.

You know the thing I find most fascinating about lower back injuries is they way they cause pain in completely unrelated places, you can understand getting twinges in your legs after all the nerve signals have to pass through the region of interest, but is it really necessary to get the sharp shooting pain in chest and shoulders, tell me, what exactly does that have to do with lower backs. Anyway... I ramble.

Oh, I also went to see that Sahara film in the intervening, think that's it now, though if I remember anything else I've missed it'll be yet another post.

Speaking of remembering, just before I sign off, you recall how I mentioned that I needed some passport photos that didn't look bloody ghastly (the current ones go in only as a matter of desperation). I went searching Oxford for one of those 'photo-me' booths, I trapsed and I trapsed and I trapsed some more and found precious few and those were either out of order or not producing photos of acceptable quality for passport purposes, or so the sign said. To be honest I was actually surprised how few of the damn things there were, I'm sure they used to be much more numerous, though that could be my memory playing tricks on me. If there's still one in the post office I'll try that one but, since it was Sunday when I was hunting, that one (if it exists) was unaccessible. At least all the trapsing was not completely fruitless, I ended up doing a bit more retail therapy than I had intended, though somehow I suspect that I shouldn't be counting that state of affairs as a triumph.

I am getting vain it seems. More sleeveless shirts (got to get the fit across the chest right too) and a pair of nice slim jeans were bought. I considered a lovely gossamer light white shirt and matching 3/4 trousers but trying them on discovered that they really just didn't look right, the trousers were too closely fitting in the leg, for it to work they really needed to be a much looser fit so they would billow suitably dramatically in the wind whilst standing at the top of a sand dune, what are you looking at? The shirt would probably have worked a couple of sizes up but damnit I wanted the ensemble and it was sadly lacking. I think I've also finally found a pair of sunglasses that suit me, well I've bought a pair at least, if I'd only known I had to look at the reflective blue rather than reflective red to make it work I'd have had expensive fashion sunglasses earlier. 

Oh yes, and my right sandal fell apart on me whilst I was walking round. 

The other thing that walking round did successfully establish was that Oxford has no camera shop that stocks either of the two camcorders I'd be interested in buying to take on my American road trip, of course it would be simpler if I didn't insist on getting top of the range type things, more fool me, so it does look suspiciously like mailorder may be the way forward and from the look of things quite a bit cheaper too.

Hmm, this was supposed to be a short update, now look at it, verbosity strikes again."

"event","Well, like it or not it's been a while since I updated so your getting the boring details whether you want them or not. Don't worry I'll try to make it brief.

I went to <lj user=""zandev"">'s very fine 2<sup>5</sup> party, it was a good party, unfortunately I ended up feeling crap part way through, I didn't hide it particularly well, if at all, and ended up with a number of people wondering if I was okay, which wasn't what I really wanted, being mopey at someone's birthday party is in my opinion extremely bad form, so I got to be cross with myself for that. Fortunately, I did perk up somewhat later on and ended up playing communist poker<sup>*</sup> until quite late. Subsequently thinking about my mopey moment in conjunction with a few things that have been said to me recently made me realise something which made me annoyed with myself again, in short my mopey moment was a result of me being even more crap, and crypticly, just to annoy <lj user=""chrisvenus""> means I have something in common with <lj user=""quisalan""> at the moment, I'm sure it will pass.

I ended up in London to see friends, freeload (since I had to be in London for work on Monday) and go clubbing again which was nice, chatted quite a bit including about being craply mopey which was worthwhile, at least now I know what's going on it might help me to get over it and in any case time heals all wounds so they say, a bandage would be nice though, nudge, nudge.

After being assured that it wasn't possible to get a new timeclock for the old boiler, the existing timeclock having died, now behaving more like a stasisclock, I had the central heating boiler replaced. This entailed rather a lot of mess as you might expect. Now the only thing wrong was the timeclock, the boiler was fine, so replacing both seemed rather like overkill, after all I only wanted to tick the box that says the central heating works properly in good concience for my house sale. However, if you can't get a new timeclock compatible with an ancient boiler it's about the only option left available. So why's this important, well, as it happens the nanny state changed the rules recently so that plumbers can't do the electrical work to fit a timeclock, that has to be done by an electrician instead these days. Therefore, the new boiler is currently connected to the old timeclock, working perfectly of course. This tells me one important thing about the whole sorry mess, follow my reasoning if you will. If an old timeclock can run a new boiler and a new timeclock can run a new boiler it would suggest that a new timeclock, might, just might have been perfectly capable of running the old boiler since all the bloody thing has to do is periodically supply mains power to the ruddy boiler. Grrr, the moral of this tale, never trust tradesmen who assure you of something even when they are putatively from a trustworthy source.

I've booked flights to Dallas and booked the time off work for it too, so nothing to stop me chasing interesting things across the great plains, oh yes, better get my passport renewed then hadn't I! Just as soon as I get a photo that doesn't look bloody ghastly. Amusingly, my manager's approved my time off work which has caused the project manager to kick and scream something rotten, we (my manager and I) can't see what's wrong, the holiday's after the code freeze date for the next release and I officially won't be employed by the company shortly thereafter, so we're just going to sit back and watch the complaint with some amusement, yes, the project manager's actually going to officially complain about it. Sigh, let's see them try to stop me going.

Apparently this is not in fact the correct response, apparently the correct response is to suggest that I instead work for them as a contractor at the usual grossly inflated rates for contract workers choosing how much work I do per week for them and for how long, so I can swan off as and when I want to. All I have to do is set up a company to trade under and this little bit of corporate insanity is ready to roll.

Why? I mean the added financial security (agreed to be available till at least September) is nice, but why? This makes no sense. I obviously just don't understand business thinking.

"event","Well I'm trying <lj user=""lanfykins""> trick of trying to fill my non working time with a social life in a desperate attempt to distract myself from the hell that is my work life. So in the past couple of weeks I've had variously a long weekend in Athens and a weekend with friends in London. Both very nice, very relaxing and satisfying during the time they were experienced and normally I'd be writing a hugely enthused, happy LJ entry about them but for one thing.

It's not working, that general bon homie is not spilling over into work.

Work is for me now more hellish than ever, I just can't cope with it. Just like immediately before Christmas when I wanted to resign and just walk away from everything and people bullied me into staying because of my financial commitments. To be honest at the time I couldn't care less about the money I'd have been quite content to just turn my back on everything. But anyway I stayed and it's still getting worse and I still have the same commitments but I need fucking closure. I need to see an end, not allow this bloody pain to drift on and on without anyone (most of all me) having any urgency to see it finished. The house has to go, the job has to go and everything involved needs to be given some impetus.

So in the meantime today I think I shall be writing my letter of resignation, three months notice is required so that would finally give me a date of closure, and if it were sooner I could just about live on my savings such as they are till the house (by far the largest financial burden) is sold.

So whilst I'm writing please feel free to play devil's advocate, is there any reason why I should try to stick it out."

Last night saw the first entry to the tally of fate points used. I was traveling home after a fine evening of sharing photographs and holiday tales with <lj user=""leathellin""> and <lj user=""metame"">. It was after midnight and I was traveling home via the back roads (heading out from Cowley towards Stadhampton along the B480). For those of you who aren't familiar with this area south of Oxford it's open farmland with dividing hedges and barring a few twists and turns a fairly straight fast road. So there I was traveling along at 50mph, lights on full beam and suddenly it appears at the edge of the pool of light cast by my headlights, a long sizable sausage shape in the right hand lane and it's moving, ambling across the road into the left hand lane. Split second thoughts flooded through my mind: if it continues ambling across the road at its present speed we're going to intersect unless I swerve to the left or do I swerve to the right and go round the back of it, a snippet of an article in a bike magazine <cite>anything larger than a terrier will have you off</cite>, what if I swerve and it speeds up, what if I go round the back and it turns round, it's decidedly larger than a terrier, this might hurt. My bike bears down on it, headlights blazing, and just before I commit to dramatic evasive maneuvers it does something I wasn't expecting, it freezes in the glare of the headlights and stops moving any further across the road. My bike flashes past it revealing the black and white stripy muzzle of a badger and the large, very solid looking grey body; my heart's pounding and I'm fervently hoping the badger doesn't shake off its temporary paralysis and do a suicide lunge under the tyres. It doesn't and presently my heart rate is returning to normal. The rest of the journey home was satisfyingly uneventful."

Four months, four bloody months of dirt digging and negative campaigning appear to be imminent. Everyone seems to bemoan this as a problem that clouds what should be more important issues but do the politicians ever take any bloody notice, of course not. The cynical might suggest that that is in fact the whole point that it means you won't have to answer hard questions and show that you've looked at issues thoroughly and consistently if you spend the entire time slagging the other parties members off. Is it any wonder that turnouts for elections in this country are so pitiful, what will it take to make them realise that a lot of people are fed up to the back teeth with it. 

I have an idle daydream, wouldn't it be so lovely if this year there was an alternative campaign, a campaign to persuade people of the power of silence, surely if sufficient people made the choice to voluntarily disenfranchise themselves such that the turnout became significantly depressed, say smaller than five percent (alas you'd never stop the politicians and all the lay members of political parties from voting) then perhaps, there's just a slim chance that the politicians might realise that there was a certain amount of discontent and might chose to change their attitudes towards campaigning in the future.

"event","Well today was a heavy weights session rather than aerobic. True to his word Eddy is mixing things up and starting to pull some very evil tricks on me. I forget exactly the precise term for a four motion compound set, I think they're called giant sets but regardless of what they're called my shoulders were blitzed by them, three sets, the first two with sixes and the last with fives. You can tell you're in trouble when the motions start slowing down later in the sets. Actually, that's not quite accurate, these weren't giant sets because in a compound set you perform a number of reps of each different exercise one after the other. By analogy what Eddy had me doing could perhaps be called compound reps, in which each rep is composed of a number of different exercise movements.

Next trick was for back, Eddy very carefully getting me to do lots of light weight sets on the lat. pull down machine. A whole mixture of stuff, different width grips, partials, the works, none of it particularly difficult or arduous. Eddy's expressed intention was to exhaust my back muscles, now to be honest I wasn't really having too much trouble with these exercises, I didn't feel much different from early on in these sets. The shock came right at the end when Eddy determined that he'd achieved his wicked ends and switched to the heavy weights, the sort of weight that I'd normally be fine with, normally that is, but not now. Oh, how I struggled, Eddy spotted and that was only a single set of fifteen wide grip and then to narrow grip, and how I struggled with those too, I've almost never really struggled with narrow grip before, well there's a first time for everything I suppose.

Last victims of the evening were triceps. I'd just like to say how much I hate triceps kick-backs, but not as much as doing slow reps triceps kick-back and negatives of the same. 

Eddy also got me to do another of the body builder poses tonight and has decided as a result that I need more upper chest development to improve the aesthetic balance, somehow, this worries me.

Now the subject of this post mentions pies, this was because at the point I started writing this post I had been out to the local shop. I had seen a steak pie in the chilled cabinet and had conceived that it would be nice to have with some brown sauce. Realising I didn't have any brown sauce at home I was about to dismiss the idea until I had an inspiration, what if the shop sold brown sauce as well. It did, so a plan was hatched, money was exchanged for goods and services and presently said pie was heating in the oven as I started writing. I had planned to extol the virtues of the steak pie and brown sauce in this journal. Unfortunately, in the meantime the pie finished heating and I paused to eat it. Oh, how things change, as I now found myself completely unable to go through with my original literary intentions because the pie was nasty, really nasty, so nasty it was barely redeemable despite the liberal, nay, oceanic application of brown sauce. Such a shame as I had been really looking forwards to it, I hadn't had steak pie smothered in brown sauce in ages, what a disappointment. Incidentally, on a related topic, I disapprove of squeezy bottles for brown sauce, where's the satisfaction in just squeezing the bottle to have a neat little trail of brown sauce extrude from the hole. We want proper glass bottles that you have to brutally manhandle, beat the living daylights out of, shriek at, curse and exfoliate before you are rewarded by the smallest glob of brown sauce from an inch wide opening. Smallest glob that is just before the floodgates of sauce hell break wide open and slick the entire contents onto your plate. I mean where's the fun and suspense of a controlled application without violence, gah!

Oh yes, almost forgot to mention, got a compliment tonight at the gym. One guy who hasn't been in for a good few months was back and commented that I'd developed quite a bit since he'd last seen me. I'm allowed to glow right, perhaps just a teensy bit, two completely unsolicited compliments about my physique in four days, a thing like that could go to a guys head. It won't though, such a thing might damage my skewed self image. However, you know, the one thing I still don't understand though is the fact that everyone considered me skinny when I first started gymming. Suppose these things are all relative."

"event","Well Silver's had his 4000 mile vet check up, next up will be new shoes, but he's fit and healthy for the moment. As it turns out the vet did me a great service, as I was paying for the service the machine refused to let my payment through which necessitated them ringing my credit card provider to get authorisation. This took some time and required me to talk to the credit card company to confirm that I was me, it appears that this was because they'd spotted a couple of unusual transactions, one for 1100 odd quid and another of 900 or so quid to some kind of family clothing store, transactions neither of which I had made as I was quite happy to inform them. They agreed to authorise the payment to the vets and have stopped my account in the meantime to prevent further leakage, so I currently have a new card in the post. Of course the interesting thing about the whole thing was that the second of the two fraudulent transactions was placed just fifteen minutes before my payment in the bike dealership where I'd been sitting waiting for the past couple of hours which made it a rather clear cut case.

I must admit to getting up rather late on Sunday, meandered downstairs into the lounge and was greeted by motion. The motion resolved itself to be a house sparrow, quite literally a <i>house</i> sparrow because it was in my house, scooting round the floor and behind the curtains. Bother I thought, this is going to be tricky, wonder how much it's deposited on my stuff already. I then proceeded to play sparrow chase for the next half hour, this brought back memories of cat catching in my <lj user=""lanfykins""> days. However, sparrow herding is trickier than cat herding because sparrows are smaller than cats and so you have the additional difficulty that they can disappear under things that cats can't. Fishing it out from underneath the filing cabinet was interesting, but other than that it was the usual game of approaching it from one direction only to watch the damn thing scoot along the skirting board to the other corner of the room and behind different furniture. I suppose I should consider myself lucky this remained a 2-D game as birds theoretically have an additional degree of freedom available to them as compared to cats. So there I was t-shirt dangling at the ready to throw over my small avian adversary being led a merry chase round downstairs. That it ended so soon was by a stroke of very good luck indeed. It made a fatal mistake, it scooted beside the front door and I managed sufficient stealth to approach to the point I could stretch over and open the front door, all that was then needed was to get it to move a foot or so to the left so that it had the obvious choice of outside or more indoor scooting. It chose outside and I closed the door behind it. Post mortem investigation of the invasion showed no open windows that could have provided access, both doors were firmly shut beforehand which left only one possibility, the poor thing had been blown/fallen down the chimney in the high winds.

All this messing about with birds was slightly annoying as a friend had suggested meeting up at a London club early evening and my late rising had left me with little time to get ready and catch trains, in fact I missed the train that I'd originally planned to take. Fortunately this only meant that I missed out on a little shopping that I had thought of doing beforehand and was able to meet up as planned. It was a good evening, very relaxed in more ways than one, not too loud for being a club and generally a very pleasant way to pass three and a half hours or so. Okay so on balance it probably wasn't the most sensible thing for me to be doing with a Sunday afternoon in early January but it was good for my self-esteem which to be honest is possibly not such a bad thing given how I've been recently. Mmmm, I like getting compliments, someone should do it more often, at least it proves that all the gym work's paying off. There were other compliments too but I'll leave those to everyone's overactive imaginations."

"event","My mobile phone has a design flaw, I wouldn't worry about in under most circumstances but when it manages to send the last text message you've written some 15+ times to one of your friends without your express intention you begin to feel that some action should be taken.

In common with most mobiles on the market you can lock the keypad so that unexpected things don't start to happen whilst it's in your pocket. However, my phone seems to have this uncanny ability to re-enable itself when stashed in the jacket pocket of my biking leathers. I blame the unlocking mechanism, one key press followed by another key pressed within a short timeout period. You might think that sufficiently secure but my biking jacket begs to differ and seems to have the button mashing technique down pat. On at least two previous occasions I've retrieved the phone from my pocket to find it merrily in the process of adding names to my address book. This time, arriving at the gym on Tuesday, it had got more ambitious and had already managed to add ***** and +*** to the address book. I must admit I thought 'oh aye', deleted the entries, checked it hadn't placed any calls and thought no more about it, no more, that is, until I was doing a bit of housekeeping last night with the intention of clearing out the sent items folder. Imagine my surprise when I found rather more messages in there than I had expected. I don't remember sending all those I thought to myself. It soon became fairly obvious what had happened. It turns out that if you happen to press just the select button on my phone ten times from the starting screen it will send any text message present in the buffer i.e. the last one composed to the first name in the address book, a scant six more presses from that point will send the damn thing again. Repeat ad nauseam, or at least till the phone got bored of using up my monthly text entitlement in the space of about ten or fifteen minutes, turned off the predictive text dictionary, and started adding names to the address book instead. Actually I'm quite impressed, + and * aren't the easiest characters to enter into the address book by button mashing. Anyway I sent the poor sod an apology for the text bomb, though blitz might be a more accurate description, and have revised my procedures and requirements accordingly. 

<ul><li>After sending a message always clear the text buffer, there are some things you just don't want propagating randomly.</li><li>Any mobile phone should not be unlockable by exposed buttons, ever, no really.</li></ul>He he, I can just tell how popular I'm going to be in the phone shop when I go looking for a replacement."

"event","Eddy appears to be moderately psychic, or perhaps merely post christmasly evil. I had been hoping to do a little bit more aerobic stuff in my training sessions to try to attack my lingering fat reserves that are hiding all my hard work. Apparently Eddy has had similar ideas and has embarked me on just such torture with no prompting on my behalf.

We were back to bugger all weight again, three sets but lots and lots of reps, sometimes no rep limit at all, just to failure and all pumped out as fast as possible. Not much, if any, rest between the sets, at times the sets were just merging into one long horrible unending superset. My only solace was the minimal rest between exercises when it was looking like I was dying. Aaaaarrgh! This made that first Monday session very unpleasant indeed. I was decidedly ashen at the end of it in need of a good long hot shower, a very, very long shower, I wasn't remotely functional until well into that shower I can tell you.

Given the light weights I was very surprised by the amount of soreness I was feeling today, certainly not as bad as the crippling pain of my first sessions but definitely much more noticeable than I have become accustomed to after weights sessions. Today was more of the same, only it didn't seem to manage to kill me as much as Monday's session, perhaps it was a slightly lighter workload, time or Wednesday will tell.

I reckon I've got one or two sessions more of big pain before I start adapting to the new regime, Eddy says it's easier doing it this way, now that I have the power to do the weight, my body will adapt to this training much faster and then we can really mix things up, heavy weights, circuits and aerobic. I dread to think what's in store, though it will fit in nicely with how I want to end up this year."

I've spent the day off work today, not because I'm sick, ho ho, but because I can physically no longer hack my job in the slightest. I couldn't program my way out of a paper bag at the moment, I can't work out solutions to even the most trivial problems, can't concentrate on the job and have exactly zero enthusiasm for it. I'm terminally tired in the mornings, regularly oversleep and then can barely see the point in getting up if only to go to the job, I don't even care enough about the consequences anymore. To be fair I've been in exactly the same situation as this nine years ago when I bombed out of my DPhil course under almost exactly identical circumstances. Holidays and breaks don't make it any easier to take, they just point out how much I hate every waking minute of the job.

It was my line manager who suggested I take today off and told me not to worry, he also recommended that I not do anything too precipitately and to go see my g.p. when I told him. I've nothing against him, he's a good bloke but I can't exactly not tell him when my failure can potentially impact on what work gets finished. The g.p. thing was echoed by my parents who are suggesting I try to get myself signed off sick because 'I'm obviously not right at the moment'. However, I can't see that it's right or appropriate to get yourself signed off sick just because you hate your job and failed to divest yourself of it and its associated stress before it reached crisis point. Of course my g.p. is currently on maternity leave and her stand in won't be seeing my until Wednesday morning, I'm going because frankly anything is better that continuing in that f**king job. All I need is the time to get rid of the mortgage burden of my current property and then I'm free. Of course when I say free I look back at the last time when I had all sorts of urges just to turn my back on the world and walk away. Maybe, just maybe this time I'll be brave enough to act on them, condense everything I own down to money in the bank and what I can carry with me and then away. If <lj user=""chrestomancy""> and TheHattedOne's planning for their world odyssey is anything to go by I'll have enough to last me possibly ten years. This leaves me with questions and choices, the biggest being whether I make myself a slave to pharmacology and accept that I will have to come back to the perversion that is modern living at some point or whether I should deny incipient dependency and accept the inevitability of the death that brings. The question then is that of life expectancy. Hurrah, at least now I have questions for my next specialist appointment in January. Yes, if ever there was a bad day to get the news that both your numbers are going in the wrong direction today would be it. So thanks to all those wishing me luck with numbers, I'd stop now if I were you, I think the will of the universe is pretty clear. My last remaining hope is that the abysmal changes are a direct consequence of the physiological response to my job stress and if that goes away the numbers will improve as well, but to be honest I suspect that that is a rather slim hope.

You know if I were looking for excuses I would almost wonder if the hatred of my job had anything to do with the rather poor choices that led me to my current situation, hmm, rewriting history is such a fine pastime but hardly very useful.

You know the first things the specialists always ask when you go in is whether you're in a relationship and whether you're employed, must remember to ask why they do that next time I go in. I just want to confirm a suspicion, I believe it's down to statistics relating to suicide risk and self-esteem, apparently it's believed that you can derive self-esteem from being in a relationship and employment, now while I can believe the former I suspect that the latter rather needs to be qualified as being in employment that you <i>actually</i> enjoy. Ah, so I see which group that puts me in! and yes it does rather appear like I'm putting my affairs in order, remind me to write a will. 

(Oh, the angst) You know, it can be so difficult being a perfectionist when anything short of perfection paralyses your ability to even achieve functional, I just can't do anything unless I believe it's perfect whether it's in my programming or other dreams and designs even when they're not outlandishly unfeasibly expensive to accomplish. My parents say that I'm being too hard on myself, but all I see is failure and being a cause of disappointment, and whilst logically I can accept that that's mostly me imposing my judgment on others without finding out what they actually think it doesn't actually stop me doing it. Right at the moment I am having serious problems justifying my existence, I haven't done anything that in my opinion warrants accepting the social charity that the huge cost of prolonging my existence entails, the one thing my parents drilled into me was to take responsibility for your actions (which I interpret as personal responsibility) and to be honest shouldn't I therefore just accept the consequences of my gross stupidity with some dignity, that'd be the appropriate response, instead I seem to be kicking and screaming and generally throwing a tantrum, not very adult, shouldn't I be better than that.

And now we return you to your usual service and the rather disjointed sentence fragment from outside the cut</lj-cut>, everyone else please just skip on by, I am aware that there are people far worse off than me."

I got into Oxford and had a good wander round, a very limited amount of christmas shopping was achieved, need to do far more next weekend and may have to do some late night shopping to finish it off.

I was about to nip out on Silver this afternoon to head into Oxford to do a little christmas shopping. For some reason, don't quite know why, I decided to look Silver over really thoroughly before I set off. I checked brake fluid levels, tyres, lights, etc and noticed in passing that there was a little pale blue liquid pooled behind one of the webs of the rear hugger moulding, funny I thought, wonder what that is. My inspection continued and I went under the pillion seat cover to check coolant level. A very white looking plastic tank showed itself to me, that's strange I thought, normally there's an appreciable quantity of pale blue liquid sloshing about in there. Two related pieces of information connected in my brain. Damn and blast I have a coolant leak, sure enough looking at the undertray identified a solitary hanging blue drop, of course there was no catching it in the act, the coolant tank was already completely empty. Unfortunately this is a vet job, I could refill it with distilled water and antifreeze, if I had any antifreeze available to me but I don't and in any case I'm discouraged by the idea of allowing money to drip steadily onto the floor. So I'm back without personal transport again until I can get Silver to the vet's, I suspect I may have to say bad and naughty words like warrantee to them. 

He was only three or four hundred miles off his next scheduled service, perhaps it's close enough that I'll can get them to perform that at the same time, but nevertheless..."

My parents are here this weekend helping me start the mammoth task of sorting and boxing in preparation for my intended house downsizing in the new year. They arrived before I was home from work and had started doing stuff. As it happened my father got chatting to the father of my next door neighbour's wife who was visiting to help look after their children whilst she's ill. Things were going fine, they were having a very sociable chat up until the point that my father was brought to the point of incoherent rage by something that was said.

Of course I didn't discover this state of affairs until after dinner when my father said to me 'I'm going to tell you something that's going to make you angry.' He then proceeded to explain to me what he had discovered in the course of that conversation earlier in the day.

You may recall that a little while ago I mentioned that I was having my house redecorated. This meant that I endured a week or so of complete turmoil with workmen staying in the house, lack of facilities for making dinner, etc, etc. During this time I had to leave the workmen to their own devices while I went out to work, trust me with as much turmoil as there was you wanted to be out of the house as much as possible, most people who have comparable work done usually stay in a hotel for the duration. Shortly after the work was finished I was accosted one morning by my arch-nemesis (neighbour the other way) who accused me of being discourteous for not informing <i>him</i> that <i>I</i> was having <i>my house</i> decorated. Quite frankly since it didn't involve his property in the slightest (we're detached that way, houses that is) I hadn't even remotely considered it any of his business. Anyway, after letting him insult me some more and almost failing to resist soking him on the nose I had let this pass. In the light of this, my reaction to my father's news, namely hitting the roof in fury, is probably understandable. It turns out that, whilst I had been out at work one day, arch-nemesis had approached one of the workmen and asked, get this, actually asked whether he could look round. Unfortunately the workman had rather foolishly said yes. Arch-nemesis then proceeded to wander at will through my entire house, every single room, before leaving and pronouncing the place 'a nasty dirty house' to all and sundry around.

After I had managed to calm down from spluttering swear words, it came down to deciding what to do. It's probably just as well that arch-nemesis is on holiday at the moment or I'd be up on assault charges. As it was trespass was considered as an actual formal charge or at least talking to a solicitor about whether that was viable and as a minimum getting a solicitor's letter written. The guy's retired and is therefore old enough to know that the workman wouldn't have the authority to grant him free access to the house, but unfortunately it's hard to pin that sort of thing down to make trespass stick and I don't really want to start that sort of a wrangle now when I'm planning to be selling in the new year since these days they ask questions on the property questionnaire about relations with neighbours. After some heated discussion of the right course of action my anger had subsided enough to allow me to look at the situation and the source of my anger with a little more perspective and rationality. I realised that my actual target for anger was the workman. Granted that arch-nemesis' request was inappropriate but you cant take him to task for asking, though making snide comments behind your back is another matter. However, you can find fault with the answer 'yes' being given to that question, firstly because it's a serious betrayal of client trust and secondly from the point of view of the contractor, should an unauthorised person get injured on the site there are liability and insurance issues to deal with. The overall decision is that I am making a formal complaint to the contractor requesting that the offending party be disciplined for the reasons above. However, that isn't to say that arch-nemesis is going to be getting away with it, it <i>was</i> completely inappropriate for him to put the workman in that position in the first place and he should at least apologise to them for doing so, particularly as it's going to cause them to be disciplined. Not to mention how much of a hypocrite he's turned out to have been accusing me of discourtesy when he's been wandering through my property completely uninvited, it's at the very least impolite to rude and verging on the criminal. By the time I'm finished with him I'm intending to make him feel about an inch high, he's still on holiday so I've got plenty of time to come up with some choice lines and at least this way tenuously there is no dispute between neighbours, just a matter of courtesies given and recieved.

I shall just gloss over the fact that my father also discovered from the same source the reason that arch-nemesis had a low wall built between our properties. Apparently quote unquote it was to 'spite my neighbour'. Charming I must say. However, privately, I do obtain a good deal of amusement from The Dandelion Wall, my name for it, you see, arch-nemesis' official reason for having it built was to prevent dandelions seeding themselves from my lawn into his. Of course, as everyone knows, wind bourne dandelion seeds are well known for their inability to cross three foot high walls!</lj-cut>"

For those of you that were wondering why I wasn't at anime on Monday missing out on <s>letching at Gene Starwind</s> the convivial company, I suppose I should enlighten you. It's all to do with <lj user=""two_nukes"">' first law of hooning. I suppose you're going to insist that I explain that too.

<lj user=""two_nukes"">' first law of hooning states that when spending a week playing silly buggers e.g. pulling wheelies and generally giving it a bit of a handful one should not be surprised by a reduction in the range of a tankful of fuel. 

Unfortunately I only authored <lj user=""two_nukes"">' first law of hooning on Monday evening, shortly after I'd pushed some 26 stone of motorbike a mile and a half to the nearest petrol station. 

In addition to anime, Monday night is normally a training night so I was obliged to phone to say I wouldn't be able to make it. However, I didn't feel too bad about doing this as I'd had a good bit of c.v. exercise already that evening, indeed by the time I was filling the tank with 17.74l of fuel, (I'd like to know where that other 0.26l was hiding, it might have got me to the petrol station, or at least closer) I was very hot, sweaty and breathing deeply. It also meant that the ride home from the petrol station was quite cold. You don't appreciate the degree to which the wind of passing penetrates leathers until you're damp and then you don't so much notice the actual wind of passing but rather the consequence of it, namely windchill. I got home at around 7pm and decided to peal off my cold damp leathers and clothes with the intention of drying out a bit before heading out to anime. Unfortunately, whilst <i>I</i> dried out satisfactorily other things didn't and the appeal of riding to Oxford in damp leathers rather put me off the trip to anime that evening which was a little bit annoying because I was planning to make enquiries about Christmas plans since I have certain limited license this year to have it with friends rather than family."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Hi ho Silver awaaaaayieeee, bloody hell!"">Well it's been getting slightly frustrating, despite my best efforts of rolling on the power I have been unable to get my silver steed to paw the air, so in desparation I resorted to the intergnat last night for some pointers.

There were a number of recommendations (well three commonly agreed upon) depending upon the friskiness of one's steed. The simplest method applies to the friskiest of steeds and then they generally increase in complexity as one's steed becomes more sedate. Of course the key information was the hints about how to apply the power.

Now it so happened that this morning I had a reasonable stretch of clear road available to me, I was in a good mood for reasons expanded upon below and consequently feeling daring, I'd just turned onto the road from a roundabout, wasn't going very fast, and was in first gear so the stage was set. What the hell, I thought, I'd give the simple method a go. 

The first and simplest method for frisky steeds is to ride the beast in first gear until about one third of maximum rpm and then wind on full throttle in the space of about a second. I think my problems previously have been not to wind on the throttle fast enough and bottle out too soon due to the remarkable acceleration that you develop at higher revs in first. Not <i>this</i> morning. 1st gear, 5000 rpm, 20mph and we're ready to go. I realise I have to adjust my grip on the throttle so that I can give it the full handful and then we're off... he he, what they really don't impress on you is quite the degree of acceleration this operation provides, there are some really noticeable forces going on. The tachometer needle swishes round the dial, 8, 9, 10,000rpm still no pawing at the air, I'm beginning to fear that my steed isn't going to be frisky enough to rear using this method and I contemplate easing off as the acceleration is quite... dramatic shall we say. Of course in the time it takes to consider this course of action the throttle is still cranked wide open and the beast is still picking up speed and then it happened. I'm not sure exactly where between 10,000 and 14,000rpm it happened but suddenly I feel and see it, we have liftoff, the nose of the beast rises and does a slight nod down and up as I modulate the throttle slightly in surprise/alarm before it settles back down on the ground as I unwind the throttle again. Not the world's longest or highest wheelie, but a first time for the <lj user=""two_nukes""> and it did at least prove to me quite how deliberate (and brave) you have to be to coax a power wheelie out of the beast. However, at that point, immediately after the event, there was a certain amount of jubilation and laughter going on inside my helmet which continued for much of the rest of my journey to work. I'd got my proof positive that I was capable of pulling wheelies. Control for longer runs and wheelies in general I think will wait for better riding conditions next year.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Successes in geekery"">Now none of this would have happened this morning if it hadn't been for a thought I had whilst cleaning my teeth. I'd been having an issue with some of the rtl source code of the language we develop in at work. The rtl code is a bit overly eager about doing a certain thing before I'm fully ready for it. Unfortunately I can't move any of my later stuff earlier because it has its own dependencies on other rtl gubbins that is done at the same time as my problem chunk of rtl code. The solution would have been very simple if the rtl writers had thought of this eventuality but they hadn't so I was left with a problem, until the thought of this morning. I remembered that the bit of the rtl I have a problem with being done early is accomplished by using a pointer to the method to be executed and I had access to that pointer. So suppose that pointer got played with a bit before the rtl started using it. Suppose that pointer was pointed at something innocuous that didn't give me problems, like a function doing nothing for example. Then afterwards after all my later stuff gets finished I invoke the method that should have been executed by the over eager rtl code, everything is hunky dory with the world, yes? Right! This was a good thought, <lj user=""two_nukes""> triumphs over the rtl, I left the house on top of the world, got into work in an even better mood, tried out my proposed solution and then sat and was smug for a bit because it worked exactly as planned, problem solved!</lj-cut>"

I could feel the start of the downward slide and then it stopped, mainly because I realised that the chair seemed so empty because it should have had someone on it, someone very particular and someone who I could place on that chair with my inner eye very, very easily. Far too easily, if you ask me. Bugger, what has he done to me?"

"event","You know those irritating people you find who play a practical joke on you and think it's so funny that they have to do it again and again ad nauseam?

Yes?

Well yesterday I discovered that the CBB falls into that category, just confirming to me an earlier comment I'd made about it that it's a spoilt brat.

If you're wondering what I'm going on about I should explain. I arrived home from the gym on my bike last night after a considerable period traveling at a most sedate 40mph. I got off and started fishing for my keys and then immediately started hopping about in alarm looking for the obviously extremely angry snake that I had disturbed.

Hisssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss. Bubble, bubble, hissssssssssssssssss.

Of course, primed as I was by previous events I soon gave up my foolish snake hunt in favor of glaring at the slowly deflating rear tyre. I couldn't face dragging the RAC out again in the middle of the night, and at least I was at home, so went in to face the bomb site that is the current state of my house and make myself dinner. The two workers who are currently staying at the house due to lack of hotel spaces then popped out to get their own dinner leaving me to settle down to toast topped with parma ham, the best that can be managed at the moment since the cooker is currently disconnected from all services. Later the workers came home and regaled me about the all they could eat meal at the Chinese in the village involving thirteen starters and five main courses. It wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that I couldn't even slip out for chish and fips because something had seen fit to deprive me of my means of transport again.

This morning I decided sod the RAC I'm not giving <i>it</i> the opportunity to give me another puncture before I get a new tyre on Friday, I'll train and bus in to work, it means I'll miss the gym tonight but i'm no longer sure I'm in the mood for it this week. Of course not wanting to miss out on an opportunity <i>it</i> rained on me whilst I was walking between modes of public transport.

I am, therefore, freer this evening than planned and have decided to go into London to see some good friends from the weekend, that should spite the bloody thing, I am going to have a good time irrespective of its best efforts. The only way it's likely to be able to thwart that will be to ensure that there's a train crash on the way. It can give me as many dreams of having a <u>car</u> accident as it likes (besides which we've done that one already and in the dream I wasn't even the one driving, too fast into a left hand bend and then understearing off the road and over the top of a tall cliff), it's just not fooling me that it's trying to save me from something, I know it's out to be petty, it really just can't stand the fact that I made the decision that I can shape my own destiny."

"event","The CBB has struck again, in petty mode. I should know better than to be inwardly bemoaning the fact that I haven't got anything to report in this journal for this month yet (partly because it irks me that without a post in the current month one's calendar steadfastly recalls the month containing the last post).

As you will recall from earlier, the CBB has forced me onto two wheels for the moment. What I hadn't realised is that it is actually attempting to deprive me of all transportation. A colleague just popped across to ask me whether I knew that I had a puncture. No, as a matter of fact I didn't, but sure enough my rear tyre is as flat as a pancake, which makes the bike unridable and me stuck at work. If it weren't for the fact that bus and train can get me home to retrieve my RAC details so that I can get the bike moved to a tyre place and reshod I would be more annoyed, as it is I am considering downgrading the CBB to lower case."

"event","<lj user=""secretrebel"">'s <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/secretrebel/51085.html"">post</a> has prompted me write a quick entry in my own journal. It's not anything too mindblowing, just something that caught my eye as I sat eating lunch outside today. Yes, that's outside, and no, it's not cold, it's really quite pleasant out today, very little wind to make things seem cooler so actually rather nice sitting weather. Of course had it been raining it would be another story altogether. So there I sat, outside, eating my baked potato, drinking my iced green tea, appalling my colleagues just by sitting out and looking round the little square in the business park that the company's premises border. For a business park it's quite a pleasant environment, trees, grass and even the odd older more established tree. As chance would have it, where I was sitting put the tallest most established tree in line with one of the other buildings in the square. It was that juxtaposition that caught my eye because the pale turning yellows and golds of the leaves and the tracery of dark branches were set off against the slightly green blue tint of the windows that run the full height of the stairwell of the building. Just made me wish I had a camera with me.

See, told you it wasn't anything terribly important but for the fact that sometimes it's nice just to pause for little things for a moment."

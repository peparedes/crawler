is it ok that i don't really know if what i'm majoring in is what i really want to do?

not so plain and simple, but at least i said it.. ha"

"event","is it just me or is everyone else sick as shit at the bullshit some people have to pull by using their livejournals? it's pathetic really considering that some people can be so talented, but yet can never say anything nice about anyone. i understand that people like making jokes and that sometimes making fun of people helps to make us feel better about ourselves, but seriously... a line needs to be drawn somewhere. i am not saying i never make fun of people, because i do. i however don't have to resort to my livejournal in order to hide from any sort of physical discomfort from saying whatever it is aloud. more over it's not so much that i make fun of people as i just tend to be honest in what i think about others (not that that is anymore right or wrong - just stating). and it's not unnecessary cruelty for the matter of looking like a bad ass or making a joke, but for honoring just true and plain honesty. 

anyway i have to say that i so happy not to be going to spruce creek university next year. i am so utterly excited about going somewhere where no one knows me and being able to start over and not to have any sort of moral or social obligations to anyone. after august i plan to delete my livejournal. i suppose i could do it sooner and even for that matter now, but i am still pretty pathetic and livejournal gives me something to do. 

i guess i feel somewhat weird lately. i feel to be asphyxiating in some sort of strange ambivalence. ambivalence to what? i'm not sure. emotions, fears, hopes, expectations, etc. i want to do and be, but at the same time i don't and shouldn't and for the most part... i just won't. i am sick of people feeling as though my future must be compared or even guided by the way theirs was. i wish people would recognize that advice is considered when asked, but when given and not needed, i'm sure there are better things for them to be doing.

also please for the next few weeks do not ask me stupid questions or for me to do or tell you things i am  not in the mood for.

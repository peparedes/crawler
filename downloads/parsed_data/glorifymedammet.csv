"event","OK I'm at a low right now.  My friend is really mad at me for making him look like a fool, and I did.  I regret it so fucking much.  I realize that without my friends I'd be nothing, I wouldn't be able to deal with anything I'd just sit at home and cry about all of the shit that has hurt me, I'd just complain about all of the things I think are unfair and shouldn't happen to me, I wouldn't go out on the weekends and remember the good ol' days, I'd probably fail out of school, fail in everything.  If there's one thing that I will remember about this school it is my friends, I know I'd always be there for them and it would feel like an automatic thing, not like I'd have to go out of my way.  I will definitely forget everything else because honestly my friends are the only bright spot in this.  Let's take a look at my high-school career.
1.) Freshman Year, start dating a girl, play basketball, do shitty in school.
2.) Sophomore Year, start hanging out with my friends from previous years, go to parties, have an early curfew, played basketball, dont even know what happened with the girls
3.)  Junior Year, seperated as a group and gained a few best friends that I hung out with all of the time, I remember endless nights of getting drunk and having fun, played basketball and loved it, had a girl then didn't
4.) Senior year, right now a blurry haze.... more of a waste of time than anything else, I have this hard sharp pain in my stomach when I think about it, but then I think about hanging out with my boys on the weekends and playing basketball, the layup lines and the bus rides, also soccer camp, waking up at 5:30, but then getting injured, towards the end of this year I wish I had done things differently .... actually the whole 4 years I wish I had done things differently, I regret one thing.

He told me ""you think you're such hot shit"", I thought about it for a second, thinking about how wrong he was but then also thinking about how people could think of me as that way.  I don't think I'm hot shit for the record, I think I am a failure, and I try to make up with this insecurity by being really competitive and having to win all of the time, I pour myself into relationships where I know I will get dicked, I cry about being rejected like a little bitch and I hate feeling like a loser more and more each day.  I don't think I'm hot shit, more like I think I am shit.  

I guess this entry is a cocktail of different poisons flowing out of my head, different feelings that I've been holding inside for a long time.  Everyday for the past week I've been trying to distract myself in everyway possible just so I wouldn't have to look at things that remind me of how much of an asshole/failure I am.  I've been in the library a lot, doing work.  I think I've done more work in the past week than I have all year, combined.  I'm so sick of feeling weak and hopeless everyday, it has come to the point where I wish I could graduate tomorrow and never see some people again.  I think I've realized that I was in love, and I know now what being in love is.  Here's the definition and I swear to God if anyone posts anonymous they are cockfaces.  The definition is, when you're in love you would do anything to get you're person back,you'd put pride and all things aside and see that you only care about one thing, even if it meant doing what is impossible.  With that one thing long gone and making me look like a fucking idiot, all I have are my friends.  People may thing the time you spend with your buddies is trivial, like having a bbq or watching the game, or getting some dinner, or going to the st. anns dance, or going to barbelow or watching FSW or playing the movie game or dancing just because that KTU is on and taking pics on the camera phone or watching scarface and drinking black rum and come home at 5 in the morning or running into random people such as Manny, Jessica, Ben and Jonah and such, or riding up to Bard College with techno, or going to cyclones games, or finding a random drum and bass club on shitstrasse or correcto?correcto, or senior concenses then asking my mom if she wanted a beer or basketball, soccer, baseball, whiffle ball,or fifa or chipped teeth or falling and getting a scar and dropping my sandwich then passing out in the bathroom, or AAU, or working for my Dad and sleeping on the job, or ""I'm sorry, I'll clean it up"" and you're grandma heard me booting, or greenfields brazilian meatplace, or the garage or john's mom's cookies, or miami vice, or legally blonde 2 while totally high, or going all of the way uptown for a party just cuz it was my bday, or bud tall boyz, or pool, or fire island and so much fucking more, they are not trivial, they are the best moments and I will remember them.  

It is time for bed, but these are the last few weeks of highschool and I might as well enjoy them so if anyone sees me down or sad just kick me in the balls and tell me to stop being a little bitch.  I think I made my point on love, friendship and memories so until next time..."

"event","ah the week is over, I didn't do my Journalism article and I have an assload of work to do but I don't give a fuck.  I've recently taken a liking to the flaming lips.. great chilled out music, although the vocals is getting sort of annoying.  I'm feeling a lot better than I have in recent weeks, one would say I am in 'good form' as of late.  I was just thinking about going to Europe and how it is going to be amazing.  I hope I survive and don't go to jail and don't get poisoned.  I'm going to be rebellious and get an ear-ring before I go.  My parents can't rip my ear off if I'm in another continent.  I have also been thinking about prom and how I really hope it is somewhat okay.  I also pictured myself going with someone I was in love with and then at the end of the night losing my virginity... haha.  That would be great and typical.  Instead I'm going with a good friend and it should just be a good time of drinking and some closure to high-school.  I just hope i don't pull one of my things and get really upset at prom and then leave and go home.  Actually i'd just leave and hop in the Excursion 14 passenger limo... slightly more pimp than my house.  I never would have thought that high-school would end this way, I guess I just expected it to be better, more of a blast... like in the movies.  I have to stop comparing everything to a movie... but I watch so many.  I am definitely ready for college and for new people, and to leave behind every Packer tragedy.  I don't want to leave my friends though.  So tonight should be fun... St. Anns dance! We'll ""paint the town red""."

"event","So I came home at 12 today because I had no classes for the rest of the day.  I fell asleep on my couch watching Revenge of the Nerds  and woke up 5 hours later.  My Mom has a new ""tasti d-lite"" obsession, thinking no-fat ice cream is some sort of cop out for a weight problem.... she's watching her weight because she is eating ""tasti d""!  My dog is sitting on my Dad's lap staring at his face like a little stuffed animal as my Grandma and Mom watch the Yankee game religiously.  I on the other hand, do not know what to do with myself, I guess the computer is the best bet for now.  I've seen too many movies to go watch tv.  Maybe I should be one of those people who exercise constantly to makeup for their boredom or stress.  Last night I pulled my groin again, in the league I play in.  It upsets me not so much that I pulled it but that I didn't get the ball at all in the second half because everyone else blows and wants to take it themself and put up some sort of shitty shot.  Right now I am just complaining about everything, it is not good to be this way... I need some sort of supplement to boost my spirits... I guess apple juice will do the trick.  I don't want to go back to Packer ever again."

"event","I get the feeling LJ is kinda falling off... it is losing some ground to friendster and myspace.  Someone has to realize that this is the BEST!  
      
So anyway, haven't made a post in a while.  Everything has been decent I guess.  Over the weekend I was in the hospital from Saturday Night to Sunday afternoon.  The doctors thought I had appendicitis so I was admitted and had to drink this crap and had to get a CTscan.  Hospitals suck so much, I've never been to one that was pleasant.  They all have that repulsive color coordination and the slippery tile floors. It turned out that I had a muscle pull in my abdomen. A woman next to me had 3 seizures while I was there, it was pretty scary just to listen to.  She was an epoleptic who had just given birth.  

Friday night was great, we drank at Burke's then went to a party on 72nd and Madison in this amazing apartment.  The kid actually had appetizers and cheeses!  I felt kinda out of place since i was from the ghetto......brooklyn.  We got pretty slashed and then we went to Smith Street which was a mistake at best and got a huge frozen concoction from Zombie Hut.  We created what I dubbed ""mercantile routes"" up the sidewalk while walking to the bar.  Saturday night was less fun, just driving around in the car is not all it seems to be.  Menotte's show on Saturday was great, they did a nice job.

I am so thankful that this week is almost over.  Every week it just seems as though I am waiting for Friday and the chance to go out.  I know these weekends that I get to spend with my friends are limited and I want to take full advantage, also school is painfully boring.  

It seems like everyone is singing the OC theme song.  

I am on a new diet, toast with jelly and dinner at home are the only things I will be eating, we'll see how it works out.  I wonder if Dr. Kolb really thinks I am going to hand in my homework today.

"event","Today was such a huge waste of time!  I went to the weightroom afterschool but ending up leaving school at 6 because I was drawn in by the repulsive amount of warcraft that was wafting through the halls.  Some Yoo Hoo was spilled on my laptop today, then when I tried to restart it, it beeped really loud.  So I figured in order to fix it, I would slam it on the table... it was a good idea because I hate my fucking laptop.  In class now, I find myself looking off into nothing, and playing with a pen or a cord or anything that can remotely keep me busy.  Work is out of the question... I haven't felt this bored in a while.  I am really looking forward to the weekend, and to the game vs. BC tomorrow... I'm starting to relish the opportunity to play baseball because I know I won't do it ever again unless it is some beer-league in college.  I also can't wait for the show on Saturday... new song and condorcet really do it to me. I swear to God NOBODY anonymously post any of my shit anymore!  Today I started to think about prom... and then I didn't want to anymore... just another sign that it is all almost over.  The OC was pretty good last night.  

TOP 5 Things I hate Most

1.)  Bad Poetry
2.)  College Talk
3.)  Not having anything to do during the week
4.)  The bleep thing on my Nextel which allows my Mom to scream into the phone anytime she wants
5.)  Shitty parties that get broken up at 12:30 in the middle of nowhere"

Went to the party... threw up..drank a lot... broke my knuckle...went to Vegas on Smith St... met some girls... went to their crib... spilled a lot of wine ... kicked this guy that a girl was previously having sex with out of the apartment because he had a small penis... went to a diner... dont remember walking home.  I wanted so much more out of the night that just didnt happen, hopefully another time.  But overall it added up to be hilarious.  Today Kemper bought Vicatin off of Burke and blew it like a shmoe.  We planned our EUROTRIP, a month and 3 days all over Europe, Barcelona, Paris, Berlin, Prague, Rome, Vienna, Amsterdam, South of France... should be a debacle and I'd be surprised if i dont end up in the drunktank, in some prison for a night.  Overall good weekend, if only they were all like this.  Also , I'm feeling a little confused, little worn out, wondering what will come next.

My Dad was honored by the city for his service to the community.  It is funny how nasty all of the O'Connell women are.  All old and so Irish and bland, getting drink after drink... they love to have a good time.  Much different than my Mom's family, all very warm and affectionate towards anyone blood related.  The Irish ones are cheap and hardnosed.  My cousins are pricks except for a couple, I'm glad I hardly ever see them.  They all have stupid fucking Long Island accents which are actually pretty funny to laugh at.  There was an 80's cover band playing songs such as 'Physical' and 'Tempted by the Fruit of Another'.  Everyone was old and wasted... hilarious.  Today is going ok, I can't wait to play some baseball...hope it doesn't rain.

Plasse's eyes were mad mad bloodshot and LeBron James dunked the shit out of the basketball.  I had so much trouble sleeping last night, I woke up every hour but I was dead tired.  Now I'm in Africa trying to keep myself busy balancing my chin on my coke bottle and typing onto the cool cool cool LJ.

Everyday we make fun , ignore, hurt and laugh at never thinking about how trivial these actions and words are in the grand scheme of things.  Then when that person is gone one feels guilt and hates themself for taking that person for granted.  Khalid was a presence in my life even if he was a very small part of it.  I remember him staying afterschool and watching him have fun like a normal kid... like I used to when I was that age.  I remember him playing basketball and thinking he was going to be good.  Despite the fact that our connection was not strong, I will miss him and I know many who will miss him in this same effect because he was a presence.  How does God take away those who least deserve it?  A question I will never understand... we will all miss you."

I went to Nathans and at two chili-cheese dogs and a cheese fries and now I'm home about to watch OK State vs G Tech.  Wow i'm exhauuusted.  People who stay in on the weekend are LOSERS!"

"event","I'm pretty empty right now.  I just feel as though everything has been drained from me and I can give nothing more.  Confustered is the word that describes me right now.  Something is missing, you ever feel like you need something, someone to revive you and fill that void... to make you feel like your old self?  I miss my old self and I miss not caring about every tiny thing and every wrong look and every bad burrito.  I keep complaining, hating , being cynical and all I really want to do is be positive but what happens when there isn't anything to be positive about.  I want to go out on the weekend and get absolutely trashed and have a blast doing it... I'm glad to have my friends... they're all I have.  At least I'm listening to some nice tunes.  Self reflection is a real fuckin bummer.  Who wants to disappear for a week and forget all of the bullshit?  I know I do... I promise not all of my entries are going to be like this ... ""cant explain all the feelings that ur makin me feel.. my hearts in overdrive and ur behind the steering wheel.. ""soo good"

"event","They're exchanging glances.  I can't tell what it is with them but I know it is more complicated than it may seem.  Why is it so hard for me to accept the way they are.  Just leave it alone and try to live with it.  Anything that normally would be trivial to others is really important to me.  I don't know what to do.... pretend not to be bothered or be visibly upset.  I'm tired of being upset and feeling inaffective and unimportant.  Feeling unimportant is the worst.  On a lighter note, Ms. Gold is not boring at all .

"event","God this class is terrible.  I am so bored that I cannot think of anything else to do besides the ever-popular LJ.  I don't really get this LJ thing.... it is supposed to be a journal but yet everyone else can see it.... it is very hypocritical because you find yourself writing things which are manipulated to be stimulating, interesting, funny or seem deep to others.  I figure since I'm on this thing, I'm not going to censor anything... i'm just going to write ambiguously .  AH just got out of Journo.... have a great day :)"

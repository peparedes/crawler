If I had a boyfriend...

I wouldnt be writing this poem to you.  
Oh so sorry...but it's true.  
 
I figured you'd be awake
and so I decided to make
 
something to entertain rachel harris
who ""WAS BORN IN PARIS""
 
i think this poem is about to be complete
for when it comes to getting clean a shower cant be beat
 
NOw comes the deep part of the poem when I say
jumping off a high diving board would be fun today
 
That part was deep because it can't be shallow
Because if it was..well...HELLO BONE MARROW
 
If you understood this poem, I must say
You've known me for too many a day!!!!!
 
brought to you by SBNEEDSABOYFRIENDIMMEDIATELY(AKANOWNOWLIKENOTLATERBUTNOW)


haha you probably didn't understand most of it. But to me, it's hilarious."

Alana had a friend sleep over and they were awake and giggling and dancing and screaming right outside my room at like 7-o-fucking-clock in the morning.  I was able to sleep on and off until like 9... then I just gave up.  And now it's 10:05 and I'm already bored.  And it's not even snowing- it's raining.

I think I'm going to resort to doing my SAT class homework.

"event","The lion has always symbolized nobility and strength.  Like all large cats, he is a fascinating creature, sinuously graceful, agile and powerful.  Lions show no mercy toward their prey, but care much for their cubs.  Over the centuries fables and stories have consolidated the lion's legend.  Lions stalked through Europe in prehistoric times, and the cave lion was a probable contemporary of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon man, who hunted-and feared- the great cats over the millennia.  In more recent times, the relationship between man and the lion has changed, with man becoming the predator and the lion the prey.  Today free-ranging lion populations can be found only in the wildlife parks and sanctuaries of Eastern Africa."

However, I can't truly appreciate this snow day due to the excessive amount of things I have to do.  Like I think if I started right now with my reading and writing and studying and packing and practicing and straightening and deciding-what-the-hell-to-do-over-the-summer-ing.... that I still would not be done at a reasonable hour.

But, I can't complain.  I have my snow."

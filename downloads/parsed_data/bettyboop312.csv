So i got to work at 12...but i was really excited cause it was supposed to rain all day...but it didnt...I hate weather ppl.  grrr... So work kinda stunk, it was just really hot and tiring.  Then I got done, came home, and had dinner.  So...now i'm sitting at home, which is alright cause I guess there really isn't anything going on tonight.  
But I really don't like ppl being out of town...luckily next week they'll all be back :) including laura...that bum. 
Tomorrow I'm going to the state golf tournament..yay. So, I better go pack!  TTyl!

"event","Hey!  Well...i started work this week.  I put in 24 hours so far,I'd say that's pretty good!  So far I like it a lot, all the ppl I work with are nice, and I haven't run into any problems with the members at oneida yet, so that's good!  yay...The only things i dont like are my uniform(ugly shirt that doesnt fit) and the stench i carry after work..like fryers...eww.  

Let's see at night I haven't been doing too much...watching movies and just hanging out.  This week i watched: Forrest Gump, Mean Girls, The Count of Monte Cristo, and The sisterhood of the Traveling pants (last night).  All were pretty good!  Max went to state for track on wed. I hope he's having fun doing that...we all miss him!  I went to the girls soccer game tonight, and they won! So now they are going to state! YAY! good job girls!!!  Jared came home from spain yesterday...I'm so happy he's home!!  It was fun hanging out with him at the game tonight.  After that some of us went to my house and sat around the fire in my backyard chatting.  I LOVE doing that...just having random conversations with friends.  Good times...

So I really don't want to work tomorrow 'cause it's supposed to rain, and i hate sitting there in icky weather when there's just 2 ppl at the pool...plus I want to go with Ashley to mike and peter's graduation party tomorrow!!  Oh..and another day off would be nice :)  
So the boy's golf team is leaving tomorrow for madison for state!! Good luck guys!  I'm leaving monday to go watch...should be fun/interesting.  I'm hoping to do some shopping while i'm down there too...which actually may happen cause i'll be with Amy nowak...who also loves shopping, yay.  SO next week will be fun.  OH! and good news! my pool is almost open...it just needs to be cleaned and heated.  Hopefully by the time i come home i can have ppl over to swim! I'm so excited!!!
Well time for bed...just in case i have to work tomorrow!  
Love ya!

"event","Wow...summer is finally here.  I haven't done too much with my free time yet.  I went to some fun graduation parties last weekend.  Then I started off my week with WORK!! WOO HOO I'm working in the cabana and doing swim lessons at Oneida.  So Monday I cleaned then got sent home...then I went shopping and some other stuff...Tuesday I golfed with my mom..that went well, then we had breakfast, then I went home and tried to work on my room..and failed.  Next I went shopping with joey to find him some shorts.  We found some good deals at AE..and express(sort of :/ ) But NO ONE had men's sunglasses...well, not the kind joey likes so really there were a lot, but joey was a lil too picky.  However, in his defense, all of the nice good looking ones were really expensive.  So later in the afternoon I went over to andy's house with max and we went hot tubbing.  That was enjoyable.  Then I hung out with peter and went home.  Today I worked again...I painted a whole fence, and it took us about 3 hours (with 7 ppl).  FUN..tonight we went to star wars...very depressing..ick.  So the rest of the week i'm working...and thats it...yay.  OK I'm way too tired to be doing this right now so im going to go attempt to sleep, night!

Ok,so today was the first day of exams.  So maria and i have first hour SH, SO we decided to go out to breakfast...and we get to school at like 9:23 and there are absolutely NO parking spots! Student lot was full, locust, kolburn, and regular teacher lot.  So finally we went to the priary teacher lot where there are 2 spots left!  So we decide to just park there...and Mrs.Brayko parks next to us...CRAP.  So we got out of the car and ran away...but tried to act normal so she wouldnt yell at us.  So we get in school..and find out it is already second our...OH MAN.  So I sprinted to the attendence office, got a pass, then the main office, got a pass for my car (whew! no fine!) and sprinted to the car, then back in, then kind of walked fast to my locker and to choir.  So...i was tired...and kind of scared but everything turned out to be fine.  And..breakfast was really good!  
My only exam today was third hour calc..I thought it went pretty well.  Then i had spanish where we ate pizza and watched sammi,lauryn,leslie, and julie's movie.  We also watched Todd,Johnny,Dave, and Andy's movie, which was amazing!! If you can, you should try to see it :)  
After school I said goodbye forever to Terry (the trainer), and then took a bunch of ppl home...then got home, peter came over...we studied Physics...I still think i'm going to fail though :/  oh well..Tomorrows my last day.

I'm happy classes are over, but I'm REALLy going to miss school. And moslty miss seeing everyone everday..and talking to everyone!! :(  BUT this summer will be a ton of fun...and so will college.  ok Well time for bed...HAve a GREAT last day!

"event","Well today was the last day of school...I thought it was kind of sad.  It definitely wasn't exciting...
So...no more classes in high school.  Wow, it really hasn't hit me yet.  

After school today I had my last voice lesson w/ mrs.poppe.  It was really sad, but really nice to see her.  She is definitely one of my favorite people of all time.  She was kind of like a voice teacher/therapist for me...I could talk to her about high school, teachers, homework, stress....and family stuff too.  Plus she helped me sing better...which in itself is a great therapy.  Oh, I'll miss her next year.

After voice I went to Ashley's and she and i studied calc for awhile, then max H. came over too. After about an hour we took a study break and went to zestys...yum.  Then we did more studying and I went home.  

So..then I sat at home and did nothing the rest of the night.  Fun.  Well time for bed. Good luck on the exams.

I went to Brian's house, then went home and watched Aladdin...I love disney movies! :) Saturday, I pretty much sat around all day..I worked on some stuff on the computer...but I didnt really get anything accomplished.  I watched America's next top model way too much..there was a marathon on VH1..i still can't believe i enjoyed that.  Then around 3 i finally got up and showered!  At 5:30 I went to the mall, by myself, and found my graduation dress, then i got some shoes for it and a belt for fun... Then i got a call from peter...and my saturday night began.  SO i was asked to have ppl over...so i did, and ppl came over and left, more ppl came, and we hung out and played poker...it was fun but im sorry to say there was a little drama...which made me really sad. So I'm just hoping that can be resolved soon.  Cause guess what...we graduate in FIVE days!!! AHHH!!!!  we need to all be happy by then!!
Ok well I have so much to do today...starting with eating a krispy Kreme, then writing my eng. paper! WOO HOO.  ok, gtg!

    So this week went by pretty fast...then weekend finally started!  Yesterday peter came over for awhile..then he left and i went to the picture party at Schotts..it was a good time.  I saw lots of pictures, and a pretty funny video!  Then I talked to schott max and mike for like an hour and 1/2 outside while they were in the hot tub, lol.  After that I went to Josh's house and hung out with the ppl playing poker...that was neat..then i went home.  Today i slept in, showered and got right to those graduation announcements...I only have like 10 left to do now! WHEW, but it took me abut 3 OC episodes to do the ones i did today..ick.  After that I had lunch and worked on putting philly pictures on my comp, then online.  I'm pretty sure i have all of them on their now..I HOPE to GOD!!!  Then I got changed, and Tim and klee picked me up and peter met us at Texas Roadhouse!!  We waited for an hour..but it was really fun.  We told our waiter it was peter's bday..and he had to ride the saddle, hehe! ohh good times :)  Then we went to klee's house and watched Spanglish..pretty good movie but kind of a sucky ending..
Now im at home, and i have to get up early cause our group needs to work on our spanish movie! Which will prob take FOREVER..then I get to start my other spanish project, my prayer project, my physics lab...etc.  YAY!  oh well..20 days!! Have a fun Sunday all~

First, I just have to say, the Philly trip was pretty awesome!  (and EXCITING)  I loved my roomates, my shopping buddies, and my dancing buddy! :)  It was all so fun!  I wish we could do it again!  But I have plenty of pictures to remember everything...from Jon with no shirt on in the back of the bus, to Gina with her Jewish museum sign, to Mrs. Schmidt sleeping in the airport...its all there!!!  I can't wait to share them friday! And They'll be online soon enough too..

So...moving on to a regular journal entry: After school today i helped Max pick out his tux, and I think its a pretty good one!  (dont worry ash, i didnt let ya down! :D ) After that...I got a bagel, then got some JoTo GO, and THEN went to Klee's and we watched Friends season 8! Uh! its SO good! I can't wait to watch some more!! Maybe after prom shopping this weekend we can see some more...just maybe..
After that, came home, started HW, peter came over and helped me mount my philly pictures on poster board, and watched some food network...YES! Now im just hanging out...avoiding my scholarship essays.  

So the rest of the week I dont really have anything going on...maybe i'll go to the track meet for awhile tomorrow, plus OC!..friday is the picture party...and this weekend will be filled with spanish movie stuff and hopefully ""friends"" and prom shopping :)

Well thats all for now...Goodnight!!

"event","Well...yesterday WAS not one of my better days.  I got up mid-morning...watched some tv, and got dressed and stuff.  around noon Laura, mike, john and i and the dads went to Marathon for a deep sea fishing trip.  We got on our boat, with captain Pete, at 1:30...and headed out to our first fishing spot about a half hour away.  The waves were huge and this boat was pretty big...but didnt take them well.  After fishing for about an hour i did not feel good.  I was definitely sea sick, and still really tired from the day before.  I waited it out for awhile...but after not catching anything for an hour and a half..i lied down and took a nap.Mike also didnt feel too good...he was a lil more sea sick than me. After he puked he felt better...but that lasted like 15 min and he layed down again for the rest of the trip...and slept. I decided to try again after awhile..but i still didnt catch anything....i got a lot of nibbles though!  Laura caught some sort of shark and a couple yellow tail...john caught  some yellow tails and a really big fish(no idea what its called!)...dad and mr. w got some more fish...and after 2 spots and 4 hours of fishing we went back to the dock...and drove home.  We went to dinner and had the fish cooked up...and i had salad and some shrimp too. Then we went back to wany's villa for awhile.  Afeter like an hour the kids (minus katherine) went to the lagun and hung out.  We talked to some really drunk kid for awhile...some weird ""not drunk"" girls and a kid from london.  We also downloaded ring tones on mikes phone...but after awhile this got old and i went home to bed.  

Today I got up, ate, showered, packed, talked to my mom outside for awhile...and then we headed home!!! Finally Im back in GB!!! YAY ! I missed you all!

"event","Today i had to get up at 7:30 for the scuba diving.  We went to the dock at 8:30 and got our gear and went on the boat.  We drove for about 45 min to our first place...reef.  We got all our stuff on and went down about 30 ft for 45 min! It was so cool!  Kind of scary..but still really cool! There were a lot of lil fish and tons of coral at this reef.  It had the mast of a ship that had sunk over 100 years ago! That was pretty cool...cause i could see some fish living in it, and there was a lot of sea life all around it.  Everything down there was just soooo pretty!!  Laura says she even found a star fish!  I saw some tropical fish...and some lobster!  Then we got back on the boat and went another 10 min to our second reef.  This time we went down 30 ft again for about 35 min.  The second reef was colder, but it had a lot more to look at.  More coral, and a lot more fish! There were schools and schools of yellow tail snapper...and a lot of tropical fish, more lobster...and just a ton of other fish and creatures that i cant name! lol...AT one point our guide pointed our a HUGE fish...it scared me sooo much!  i swear it was like 3 Packers big! (as in my dog,Packer).  lol...whew...Well after that dive we came up and took of the gear and wet suits...and then we rode back to the dock...for about 45...and over that 45 min most of us burnt our feet, shoulders, backs and arms...especially laura and I.  We were all pretty smart and didnt put any sunscreen on.  Luckily my burn didnt turn out TOO bad...but the next day lauras was a red/purple color...OUCH!  So...After the scuba diving everyone went out to lunch...and then back to the villas!  So i was at the villa for a half hour..and then i went parasailing with katherine! It was fun again...This time i saw a sea turtle!  pretty cool...then i went to the villa for about 20 and went to the dock again and went jet skiing with mike john and my dad. That was pretty fun...it was the first time i ever drove a jet ski all by myself!! i enjoyed it... :D  
After that i was so pooped...so i ate some bagel bites and watched tv in my parents bed...talked on the phone and went to bed at about 11.  That was definitely the most active day ever!!! im tired just thinking about it...whew!!!"

We drove along a canal for a long time...looking at a bunch of...what mrs.Wany called ""drug dealer's houses""...we tried looking for a beach to stop at...but we had no such luck.  So we just kind of went around the island for awhile. At one point laura was trying to tan in her seat...and a seagull flew by and pooped on her boobs!! Probably one of the funniest things on the whole trip. Especially cause at first she just thought mike threw a grape at her...then we all got to watch as she realized it was bird shit...great moment.  We got done with our boating trip around 4 ..and went and swam for awhile. then we all showered and went to eat, then watched tc for awhile.  Laura emily and i decided to go for a walk and then we met up with John and mike at the lagun...which is one of the pools on the far side of our resort where a lot of the older kids hang out.  So we sat there awhile...laura made kind of an ass out of herself..a lil, and she was dawned the names ""Poop tits"" and ""Shitty titties"" for her earlier encounter...lol!  We met some guys from Michigan, Indiana, and then a guy from cleveland.  Laura and i talked to cleveland for a bit...he basically asked me questions and laura decided to talk for me...and then tell him my life story...kind of embaressing...but i didnt care cause he was kind of strange himself.  After some chatting and making fun of laura...we decided to go home and to bed!!"

"event","Hey!! So the cottage was REALLY fun!! I had a great time guys!!!  
Here's what happend...well i got up around 12 sat....and we were planning on meeting at max's at 2 to go...and klee and i didnt really feel that...so it ended up being oh...3 when we got to max's..hehe.
SO we traveled up to Oconto..it was a nice little drive, and we unpacked...oh no wait! that was just me, because peter definitely dropped my bag in a puddle!  THANKS pal.  So I unpacked and dried my bag...and then we got right to the good stuff: Food and Poker!  So we ate some really good pizza dip and brownies..Then Teske and Kori came and we had some papa murphy's pizza, and i finished the poker game with $2 (so i ended up even!) and we put in animal house.  Good movie...then some ppl decided NOT to watch it and instead go outside and run in the snow naked...good idea!  Well i didnt do it, cause theres no way im getting sick again or letting anyone see me naked...no
So! after THAT the ppl who ran outside also decided to play the ""fun"" kind of poker...or i should say more fun...but i didnt...again!  And...after everyone decided to be decent we played truth (cause we couldnt do dares) and after awhile...when the renkens went to bed we played dare (to make up for no dares before). That proved to be VERY interesting....im not going to go into too much detail...but teske definitely humped my head.  I will never be the same.  
After THAT we just slowly started winding things down...we played a couple more games...and talked...and eventually went to bed..at 5.   today we all got up slowly..had cinnamon rolls...watched caddy shack and came home.  All in all...a wonderful weekend!  I'd have to say our talks were AMAZING and the whole Truth or dare game was pretty fun too...especially since i hardly had to do any dares :) yay! 
I can't wait till our next sleepover :D hopefully we can have some more ppl come too!  Have a great week!

"event","YAY! I've had a great start to my weekend! Last night I went home and watched TV for awhile, then after awhile went over to Max's house and Max peter and i went to the girls bball game in seymore! That was actually really fun cause a lot of people came, and the girls won!  yay! then we all went back..and we hung out and watched a cool new show called ""Numbers,"" it was one of those police finding the killer shows...but they use math to do it.  Doesn't sound really appealing, but trust me its good.  THEN we went to Beardmores, we just hung out.  I got to meet Enrique there..we had a nice lil chat, and I decided he's a cool guy.  :)
Then we went to Taco bell...and then i came home and watched some OC, then the middle of ""Troy"" with Laura.  Then bed...
Today we're going to Timmy's cottage!  WOO HOO I'm sure that's going to be a LOT of fun!!  It is to celebrate tim's birthday...which is March 8th in case anyone forgot. lol. So I'm not sure what exactly we're going to do, but i know it will be a blast..and there will be some OC watching at somepoint! lol  oh boy...well i need to go shower and pack! Bye!

Then we went to Bressars' for like 20 min. where i just ate taco dip and spaced out.  It was a late and horrible night.  Oh well...now i have a life, i have time to work on my eng paper, and other hw...and studying for physics test.  
Today was kind of sucky, definitly a monday!  I had to learn a lot..and do a lot of busy work...the one good thing was that i got a really old eng paper back and i got an A on it...so that was nice! 

This week is a little hectic..i have my final voice lesson before Solo and ensemble, i have a pretty big research paper due thursday, and i have a new problem in my life: laura has a drivers liscense!! uhh...now i have to share the car... ick

BUT I do have a fun weekend to look forward to up at Timmy's cottage!  YAY!!  I can't wait.  i just want to relax, and sleep...and sleep..

"event","Hi there...
     So tonight was the second night of the musical. I'd say it went well despite certain technical difficulties...but our wonderful pit pulled through so THAT was good!  Oh and i'm sick now...so i couldn't really talk or sing tongiht, which was sad, but at least i could dance and everything.  After the show we all cruised on over to Sam Toigos...the promised cold stone ice cream was not there, but i still had fun sitting in a circle for an hour playing the word association game :)  ...Roscoe/tight was mentioned at least 4 times.  Last night was opening night...which went VERY well!  I was pumped.  After that we went to Emily Rock's house for the cast party.  That was fun, except we were all so tired half the ppl just passed out.  oh well.  Before the show we had school..not so fun.  I got waaaay too much hw this weekend, im really dreading doing that tomorrow.  ick
So yea...tomorrow is already sunday, im really hoping i won't sleep in until 1 again like i did today, cause like i said, i have a lot of hw to do, and i want to be able to just sit and watch american dreams tomorrow!! lol...it's going to be crazy not having practice!  yay.. After tomorrow we have 2 days off of the musical, then pictures one night, dress rehearsal, and the show again friday!! And all of you who haven't seen it yet BETTER COME!!!  

Well I could go on to talk about what im doing some more but that's just getting boring...so i have to tell everyone about how pumped i was friday morning!!! I got to see a real live LIGER on good morning america!!! ""It's pretty much my favorite animal""  : D
Its name is Herculeus..its mom is a tiger and the dad is a lion..ahhh...I was soo excited to see it.  If you think im making it up ask tim shinkton, he saw it too!!! 
Well i need to go to bed now or i will sleep in too late again, ttyl!

"event","UHH So tonight i got home from musical practice at 10:45...tight!  but at least it was 15 min earlier than last night!  yay..

So every night lately i've been at practice...so i havent been able to write in here.  But i really need to just relax and vent for a bit.  First i'll talk about my weekend...

So friday after school we went to el azteca...that night we went to timmy's house..I sat while everyone played poker..and i watched without a paddle.  It was an OKAY movie...funny but kinda dumb..all in all, entertaining. Saturday night went to Adam Pickering's house. That was fun! I did a lot of dancing...and i almost broke my toe kicking a chair(accidentally)...we also met ""Mr.Danger"" from preble..i liked his stories. There were also a couple funny quotes that came out of that night...
""Hello!!""-Max and Tyler
""Colleen! Blow this!""-Amy
""Yea i duck taped it down..."" -Mr.Danger

...im sure there are more i can't remember, you can put any other quotes in my comments if you want.
So sunday I woke up early and had to go to tech rehearsal all F-ing day!! Then I came home and was pooped...so peter just came over and we watched a movie.  FINALLY monday...I woke up and rolled outta bed...went online and found out i was going out to lunch!  So peter came and gave me pink roses! and then we went to applebees for lunch...came home and finished a movie.  Then I kicked him out and I went over to Brian brockman's house to work on our spanish proj. w/ megan and max!  After that I had rehearsal again! I got to go put makeup on early...you can look at my musical pictures to see what that looks like...let me tell you...its a b-otch to get off...took me 20 min last night and this morning! GOD...

So today was FUN...school...mrs. smith told us that she didnt teach us our lesson right..THANKS.  I got a lot of hw that i wont finish...and im prob going to get behind in calc and spanish because im missing school all day thursday! So my ""free"" thur. night will be spent studying, doing hw, and sleeping!...damn
oh well..i get to come to school late tomorrow cause i have a dentist appt.!! yay!..except that means i'll be missing even MORE school.. : (  yea im probably the only person who'd be upset about that..

ON to me venting just a little bit.  I HATE how our school gossips all the time...I know we have all discussed this at some point of our high school careers..but it is REALLY starting to bother me now...
Between the students...teachers, and Mr.Nowak..its getting stupid.  I know i am guilty of this too, but its terrible.  First of all ppl should keep really important stories to themselves..cause you know if you tell someone, its inevitably going to spread.  Second..if you DO tells someone, make sure its someone who won't have a motive to tell EVERYONE else.  But..I just decided that if I kept going this would just sound like me whining (even more), so I'll stop. Plus, as i said before..you all know what im talking about.  This is just my venting, cause im a lil annoyed today.  Well!  I should prob go to bed now!  Goodnight!  ANd you BETTER come to the musical....please.  :)

It was a good weekend though.  Friday I got to go to Zesty's!  Then we went to the mall...and we walked around there for awhile.  Then some of us went to my house and i saw Napoleon Dynamite for the second time...AMAZING!  I LOVE that movie.  Saturday I woke up...had breakfast and sat online for awhile.  Then I went to the basement...and watched the OC til 3...omg how depressing!!  Finally, I showered, made dinner, ate it..and went to pup's house.  We watched King Arthur, good movie!  Then we went on over to Jared's house...lol good times.  There we just hung out, some ppl played online poker, some were having fun with the ab roll!?  and I played fooseball..then sat around and talked for awhile.  OHH fun...

So im really glad that last week is just over!  Too many tests..and the skit, ick!  But i guess they all went pretty well.  Next week is just a lot of nothing..then sweethearts! We better find something good to do after that! cause i have tech the next day...and then my life will be over. lol..until Feb. 27
Alright time to start my day! Bye!

I just have to say...today i bought the OC dvds(i had xmas money to best buy) and they are AMAZING...I definitly watched 5 episodes in a row..and prob 3 before that.  UH that was nice.  SO what else did i do this weekend?  hmm well i went to phantom of the opera friday.  I also watched ""Supersize Me.""  An interesting movie...BUT i know some people wouldnt really like it if they take it really seriously.  I watched it as an interesting documentary on a guy eating mcdonalds for 30 days...but if you pay attention to the political stuff in it, and get really angry about it...then obviously, you wont like it.  Just in case you wanted to know...

Today i hung out a lot...bought my dvds, watched them and ate taco johns...then later went to peters and watched oc some more...Then damons..the night goes on.

My week was not interesting at all...it was filled with musical practice, homework, OC night at jareds...and a little drama of my own, as always...because im in high school : /  
OH well...life goes on. Have a great night and a WONDERFUL sunday.

Well lets see, yesterday was the last day of exams..so after I got THOSE over with..max,gina,ethan,kevin,and andy and I went to ABC for a short lunch, then we went back to school and had musical practice for 3 1/2 hours...but it was kinda fun.  We learned another dance!  After that I went home and hung out for awhile.  At night we went to max's and played DDR...wow...I honestly tried to do one song..20 times and failed at it EVERY time.  I'll get it next time though...really.

Today I slept in..did some errands, then eventually hung out at max's house, we watched Rat Race..then we had dinner and watched some OC :)  Next we went to klees..and watched Eddie Izzard..and pretty much just slept.  It was overall a very nice night :D    Well since I dont have any homework..I think I may go shopping in Appleton tomorrow..then a 3 hour musical practice...ick!!  Hopefully it won't be too bad though...

Well I'm way too tired to say much else.  BUT  Good job to everyone with exams last week!!  Especially maria with her 97 in calc!! you're my hero!

ClS because I don't want to get a BS grade and have it drop my whole semester grade, and Physics because I really do not remember anything... ick..

Today after school klee timmy max peter and i went and got food and hung out..we played online poker and dominated (mostly) and then watched Napolean Dynamite...good movie.  After that...OC and some studying yay!

I'm really hoping tomorrow just goes fast...cause I just wanna sleep and have fun...so yea.  I have a feeling it really wont be..just because we are all so drained from this week. PLUS I have musical practice...uhh!!(I just remembered that!!) So that'll be for 3 hours...but after that i'll want to do ANYTHING to get out of that school! :/ 

So my last couple of days have been kind of shitty...what with exams and other complications.  Plus I found out today that it doesn't look like my cousin Joe is doing very well, and will probably be paralyzed now.  So..great.  I don't know why I became so morbid all of a sudden ...sorry.  Well I'm gunna go before I start rambling on... goodnight and good luck on your last day of exams

Then I went home and decided to stay up til 1 watching my OC tape...it was worth it, but I really need to learn to just go to sleep when I get home. 

Saturday i got up at 10:30..then I hung out at home all day.  I kind of started to work on exams stuff, but that lasted for about 20 min, then ppl came over.  We played poker most of the night..this time I lost $2...then we ate some subway, and watched the best of Will Farell, and best of Chris Farley DVDs.  They were hilarious.  After that we mostly played pool and talked... : )
Then some of us watched Troy...lol, but only a couple of us watched til 1:45, lol! What a great movie! : )

Well today I decided I'm going to finish my spanish study guide, type out my CLS essays, and work on the english essays.  So I have a lot of work cut out for me...and I probably won't get to it all.

Last night...I went to training and got to see Margret!! yay!  I miss her (she was our school's old trainer...just so you know).  Then Laura and I went home.  Then I found out ppl were going to Puppy's for poker, so i called up klee to let her know the plans...and she was working, and hungry! : /  SO...I went to pick klee up some T-bell, dropped it off...then went to peters and lost my $5 within about an hour...then I just sat there and read my Mahlock story, then watched the game for a bit.  Then I went home..and did a lil homework, and went to bed.

Today was boring...it was just school.  After school laura and i went to training...and stopped at good ole Zesty's on the way home! yummmm...  Then I sat and tried to study for awhile...but I had practice at 8.  Practice was pretty fun tonight...we finished our first dance so that is neat.  After practice we just went home.

I'm pretty excited about our sweats day tomorrow! What a great friday..except for all the tests we have to take!! (Good luck to Everyone by the way!!!)  I should probably go study for those...  I also have my CLS presentation tomorrow!! I'm nervous..because I hate speaking in front of people...and poor lil Kathleen is sick!  I'm sure it will go okay though.  Another good luck to everyone who has to do presentations tomorrow!!  

Well I'd write more but now I'm starting to get a little stressed about my tests tomorrow..so i need to go study before i got to sleep! Goodnight!!

After CLS today I got really tired all of a sudden...and in Physics I could NOT pay attention, so I had to call my mom and tell her to cancel my voice lesson cause i needed to sleep.  So I came home and took a lil nap, and i dont feel much better.  I think I just need to go to bed earlier...so no more talking late online!

Thats a new record for me!  Then yesterday I just hung out...it was the second day this break that I didn't change! lol
I watched a lot of TV..Laura and I watched food network!  I was really sad cause no one could do anything...so we chatted together online, and talked about new years : )  I stayed up til 3 talking online, then went to bed.

Well Now that the week is over we need to work on those projects, and papers..oh well..we still have one more day! lol

Today I ran around and did errands w/ max..it was fun..I went to the mall again.  BIG mistake.  Don't go to the mall for a month or two...til everyone has returned their christmas stuff, cause right now its still impossible to find a good parking spot, and the lines are still not worth the wait.  
Well after that I came home,and watched an espn special on the packers!!  Next i got ready for whatever i decide to do tonight for new years...I think klee and i still need to figure that out.  After that we're coming to sleepover at my house!! lol should be a fun..and interesting night!

I had no clue what was going on...but then I figured out it was my cell phone, and she was wondering what time i was picking her up, lol.  Alrighty...then i went online, talked...got offline, got dressed...picked up the crew at costello's and went to Katherine's birthday party!  That was fun!  

After the PARTAY we went to Max's.  So Max got Ben, and peter brought his X-men video game, and they played that while i sat and watched OC upstairs.  When I ventured into the ""gaming room""  I found out that the guys love the game, but just had no clue what they were supposed to be doing.  Ben kept using his ""energy"" up by jumping up and down everywhere he went...then someone would die, and everyone just sat there.  And half of the time the guys were figuring out what each character could do with their ""mutant powers.""  NEAT
Finally Liz came over, and we shared a common bond...and made fun of the guys and their game.  After awhile we got hungry and decided to see a movie.  We took a fun drive thru McD's, then headed on over to the theater...and our movie was sold out, so we watched Anchorman.  That was a good movie.  Liz and ben enjoyed the ""West Side Story"" scene...I know it.  Then we all took a nap.  Then Max had the ingenious idea to play x-men again.  So I made fun of it, while liz took another nap.  Then we got kicked out. 
So that was my day!  Tomorrow should be fun...Max's 18th birthday, and lots of poker.  I'm sure it will be wild.  But no...
Well I don't have anything else to talk about tonight, so I'll just talk more tomorrow!

"event","So..today was not one of my better days.  I still have an awful cold, I didn't get very much sleep, and I didn't have a good night...except for poker.  Today I woke up and got to relax for awhile...then i got ready and went to the mall again.  

Mall was fun cause klee and i found some cute stuff!!  Then we stopped by max's to watch a movie..then i went home...so great. 

THEN there was sledding which lasted hmmm...45 min.  then we went to jar's and watch American pie 2, and i was pam's poker coach...but I got even more sick cause of jared's cat : ( 

well im just really tired of ppl being shitty to eachother..it's sad, and mean, and friends shouldn't do that.  For some things...I dont know the full story, but we should just be friends, and treat eachother decently.  Thats all I have to say.  

Be happy.

"event","YAY!! It's here!!!  I hope everyone is enjoying their christmas! Quality time with the family  : /...good times.  My day has been great besides the fact that I have an awful cold! I think i got it from sleding..cause i got it yesterday.  

I have to tell everyone about how cool Fritz is:  last night we went to church.  I tried pretty hard to sing with laura..and so did dad.  Dad decided it would be pretty funny to sing as loud and obnoxious as possible.  Laura and I just burst out laughing during ""Hark the Harold""  he didnt really like that.  So then the final song of the night was ""Joy to the World"" he gave laura and i a smirk, and just belted out ""JOY TO THE WORLD"" as loud and off key as possible...that was funny, we were in tears by the end of the song.  My dad was pretty cool today when he bought the family a set of World Poker Tour poker chips!! Laura and i were pumped!! lol
What a fun day :)

I'm looking forward to all my friends coming home though...I miss talking to everyone.  But tomorrow will be fun, and this week will be great too!  Well I dont have much more to say tonight, but I'll write more later!

"event","Merry Christmas eve!!  I hope everyone enjoyed their extra day off!!  It was nice to relax...although i couldnt really sleep in.  Last night I got to go out to dinner with Fr.Dave, the wany's, and the heinrichs! The food was pretty good...but no one could top the atmosphere...a lone male (fruitcake as Fr.D would put it)singer, who strained to sing over our parents' yelling/laughing (we did request ""Drummer Boy"" after almost every song).  It was a good time...  Afterwards I went sledding with max, peter, and john. Haha...I was the only one who brought sleds! I had 3, but then peter sat on one and blew it up!! (way to go!)  So we shared the two..after sledding got old we went to the jungle gym.  While the boys played on the slides...I looked on, and then decided to make snow angels...and they thought it would be funny to come and RUIN THEM! (jerks!)  So I kept making them...and they got sick of ruining them, and finally just picked me up and brought me back to the hill. Good times...

After a nice hot chocolate at costello's I came home and went to bed.  This morning I was woken up by katherine starting to open presents without me...so i ran down and watched her...and that was fun.  Laura missed it because apparently she never made it home from wany's...:( Now we are just sitting on our buts...watching tv.  Eventually we'll probably eat, then go to church.  What a great Christmas eve!  

Well I hope everyone has a great day!  Have fun with your families!! :/  Talk to you soon!

"event","I had a nice, boring day at home today.  Some family came into town for the packer game! When they got here we helped them make a sign, then we had pizza.  After the fam left laura and I watched ""Saved"" on pay-per-view.  It was a pretty good movie, we probably only thought it was funny cause its all about a christian school, and they LOVE JESUS...maybe a lil too much.  While we watched I wrapped all of my presents for my family.  After our movie the packer game started...then i went to target and got some really good presents for some friends!!  I came home..watched the packer game, made a cd...and then I got REALLY angry cause packers lost.  So i studied for spanish...now that i know all of my aztec gods, I'm taking a little break!  

Last night at 1:00 ben and max decided to come over...we had a nice little chat, fritz even joined in for a little bit.  Good times...

I have to apologize to all the ppl I went shopping with yesterday...I got 7 hours the night before and I was REALLY tired and cranky!  I promise to get to bed earlier!! I hate being tired and crabby.  Anyway..2 1/2 more days guys!!! Christmas almost here!! : )

"event","SO!  First I just need to say thanks to klee for giving me this idea, and letting me copy her...without her permission. hehe  OH! and today I got my first 10/10 in physics! I'm pumped...
Next! I have to talk about my ride home with L-tits!  First: we stopped at the dollar store and Michaels to find things to make for x-mas..so that was an adventure.  Next: we stopped at Tbell for an after school snack...Laura made me do it.  Then we had the ride home!!!  The first crazy person we saw was an old man with no teeth...he looked at laura and was apparently making weird faces at her, so she told me to look at him and he made the SCARIEST face at me and then he started racing with me! So I sped up and he turned!  Thank God.  Next we were on the mason st. bridge and laura said some guy waved at us in the car next to us..which was a gold suburban..and from my angle it looked like Joseph Smeal.  So I kept moving, and when i started passing the car laura told me to wave, so I did, and just after i waved at the guy...we discovered it was a scary mexican guy!  OMG...I was so freaked out..cause i swear it was smeal!  So he sped up and kept waving...and i got off the bridge.  Finally laura and I were almost home and we were getting onto the ramp to Webster when i pulled up next to a taxi at the stoplight, and laura goes, ""Colleen!! look at the guy next to us""  and it was a greasy, tiny, white guy, with a pony tail.  He kept hoping in his seat, and when the light turned green he did an extra high hop and sped off really fast.  It was both funny and frightening.  Lets just say that was the strangest ride home ever.  

Well I'm off to work on my O'Connor essay now!  Talk to you soon!

so ive gotten a little bit into cartel. i mean theyre pretty good, so i guess i just should get theyre album instead of occasionally listening to them on myspace. the funny thing is is that their guitar player joe pepper was in a band with my brother and he played guitar in that band too. so yeah thats pretty funny.  

 i need some pants. im going to earn money and buy some clothes or whatever. i dont buy clothes much anyway.  being in a big family kinda sucks bc you get used to getting clothes from older siblings and shit like that. but hey there are ups and downs of having a big family."

i didnt know what to think. it made me think a lot though. i thought about mary and when she shot herself. and brynn was thinking about her neighbor that died. as if that didnt get to me enough...

mr rowser warms us up and hes lookin like hes about to cry. mr cresswell comes on the intercom and he starts crying as he asks us to stand for a moment of silence for officer dafney. mr rowser comes out and he is crying, that upset me. a lot. rowser lectured us for a while and told us it was okay to cry and all that. and then we had to say the pledge in second period. and the lady on the intercom starts crying.

seeing mr rowser cry made me feel...like i never felt before. mr rowser has been the father i never had. so at the end of class i went up to him and i gave him a hug. it made me wanna cry so bad just because as much as rowser may have goin on in his life, he always manages to be the sweetest man ive ever met. 

ive been thinking about it all day, and its so weird.

a lesson to everyone:
       cherish everything and everyone you have in your life. give them love and take care of them. we, as humans, dont realize how much someting or someone means to us until its taken away for a while, or goes away for a long time...or leaves forever."

"event","well, my day was interesting.


people pick on my little brother when he tries to do nice things for people on the bus. so today, there is this girl named candy who accidentally stepped on this white guy's shoes (this white  trying waaaayyy too hard to act black) his name was joey.  my brother ben has a crush on her, and so he decided to be nice and get the shoe back for her. joey and this other black kid named jeremy or someting start yelling at ben and start picking on him calling him names and making fun of him nand are being total jerks. and poeple dont realize that ben has fucking feelings. what people say to him hurts, even though sometimes he might not understand, he understands some certain things. so as im witnessing people pick on my little brother, i go up, and i say calmly to joey ""joey, you have no idea what youre getting yourself into and you have no i dea who youre messin with so you might as well stop...this is our conversation from there

joey-bitch what the fuck you doin ill do whatever the fuck i wanna do
me-joey youre making me do something i dont wanna do so you might as well just be  quiet and turn around
joey- man shit bitch i dont wanna fuckin turn around ill do what i fuckin want
me-joey shut the fuck up and turn the fuck around this is fucking ridiculous *now im pissed as you can tell*
joey-what if i dont wana fuckin turn round
me-okay, fine, but dont talk to me and dont talk to my brother, so shut up, and leave ben alone bc you dont know who youre messin with..and you also need to turn around
joey-what if i dont wanna turn the fuck around bitch ill do whatever the fuck i want

so finally katherine comes up to joey & sits with him to make him shut the fuck up finally. he only shut up because hes in love with her. and so now ben is upset, i know he is, people dont see ben the way i do...

so i come home... this is my conversation with my mom

mom-hey cara how was your day.
me-horrible
mom-why
me-because i hate some of the poeple in this neighborhood that ride the bus

so i start talking about the story of what happened on the bus with joey, after that i cracked...this is what happened after

me- PEOPLE DONT FUCKING REALIZE BEN HAS FUCKIN FEELINGS EVEN THOUGH HE DOES HAVE A LEARNING DISABILITY. PEOPLE ARE MEAN TO HIM EVEN WHEN HE DOES THE SWEETEST THINGS. HE TRIES TO DO SOMETING NICE FOR SOMEONE AND IT JUST ALL FUCKING BLOWS UP IN HIS FACE AND IM THE ONLY ONE THAT FUCKIN UNDERSTANDS BECAUSE IM THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN STAND UP FOR HIM BECAUSE NO ON ELSE FUCKING WILL STAND UP FOR HIM. BEN HAS FEELINGS, EVEN THOUGH HE DOESNT UNDERSTAND SOME THINGS...

**silence**

this is how passionate i am about family. family is life people, and we all gotta stick up for eachother. ben doesnt understand certain things, and unless you have a sibling thats mentally challeneged, you probably might wonder why im standing up for someone who is bein picked on that might not even understand.

children have feelings, we all do, were all children. even someone that is autistic has feelings, but some people just dont realize that bc they think mentally challened poeple are ""looney"" or""crazy"" or they ""have some loose screws"". every person on the face of this planet, autistic or not, has feelings

"event","well, i figured i would never do this...but i think i know what to say now instead of ""everyone is entitled to their own opinion""

to all of you who saw what happened in one of katies journal entries...about the freshman immaturity and whatnot.

we are all immature in our own ways and we all know it. yall wanna see MY immaturities.

1)im clumsy
2)im impulsive
3)i offend people witout even knowing it, such as when i say ""everyone is entitled to their own opinion"". i say those words bc i dont konw what else to say, i get confused, and i like to hide it.
4)i bottle in my feelings most of the time, and i lie to people by telling them im okay
5)i have had many problems with drugs and alcohol,drugs as in not only weed, but ice, cocaine, pills, crack (only done it once), and everything else. i have NEVER shot up though.
6)sometimes i jump to conclusions
7)i blame myself for things i shouldnt blame myself for, such as my parents divorce, no i dont think im the blame anymore, but things like that CAN get to me, and other people as well

those are a few of my immaturities

the point is guys, is that if someone says something we dont agree with at all--such as in this case the ""freshman immaturity""--we have to be civil and show that in situations like that, we can keep our cool, and not curse and show our anger in all capital letters, etc.

im not pointing the finger at anyone, this is just an opinion. if you dont like what i think, thats fine, i respect your thoughts, feelings, and points of views. and if by ANY CHANCE, you do get mad at me for leaving this journal entry, leave a comment, but dont be rude and cruel and mean about it, because thats what makes people think of us as immature. the point is this, EVRYONE on the entire planet has their own immaturities and flaws, and were ALL humans. so yeah...thats my view on all that"

I'm curious to know who is visiting my page.

I suspect that I may already know some of you, either through being on my friends list, or through having friends in common. Any comments left here will be much appreciated, and will be answered."

"event","Yesterday I visited the battlefield of Gettysburg. 

It was a strange feeling to look across the quiet fields where Pickett's Charge decided the course of the whole American Civil War, firstly from the west at the point where 15,000 of the South's bravest began their move, and then eastwards from the top of Cemetery Ridge where the Union army watched them coming. Today all is quiet apart from the cars driving along the roads which cross the fields. I cannot imagine what it must have been like for those who made that crossing during the 30-40 minutes that it took with every step of the way under fire from the Union cannons and muskets."

"event","Last October <lj user = ""this_is_warmth""> started an LJ community to record and share her photos of birds in her back yard. I enjoy photographing my avian visitors too, and quickly joined to learn about birds nearly 1/3 away around the globe from my back yard. It's fun!, and I have learned a lot.

A couple of weeks ago I suggested to <lj user = ""this_is_warmth""> that there are probably many other lj users who photograph birds who might be looking for a place to share their experiences. We agreed that one way to find out would be to see if we could get the community nominated for a Spotlight position on LJ's front page. Last Thursday I put the nomination together ..... and 2 hours later the flood gates opened! There we were on the front page with posts pouring in so fast that I couldn't keep up with them. The level of interest has exceeded my wildest guess. Some of the photos are truly amazing, ranging from rare waterbirds in Florida through LBB's (Little Brownish Birds) from everywhere and some very beautifully coloured birds of all sizes up to majestic eagles and hawks.

We have contributors from all around the world, and the Members list is longer every time I visit.

It's well worth having a look, if for no other reason than seeing a small sample of the wide variety of beautiful birds with whom we share this Planet."

"event","WOW!!!   You've got to see this!

The real time clip runs for just over 6 minutes. There is a sound track, but you will have to turn the sound volume way up to hear it.

The high speed clip runs for just over a minute.

I'm still trying to make my mind up if there is an astronaut riding in the open cargo bay at the front end.

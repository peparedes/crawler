<P>the other night matt let me off work an hour early because it was slow and i think he felt bad for me because i was in such a pissed off mood. but then i went to abby's house and becky was there and audra's friend from california. she was awesome.<BR>then later people started coming from the show for the party. <STRONG>(fuck anyone who has a problem with me listening to the oprahs. i listen to what i like. not what will make me ""hard core"". yeah <FONT size=5>wes, FUCK YOU</FONT>)</STRONG> so to sum up that night: got fucked up, took my first beer bong, and hung out with some cool people.</P>
<P>then yesterday i went to my dad's company's picnic at some park in brookfield. it wasn't too bad. then i had work and i looked at the schedual for next week and i have <EM>ONE</EM> day. and that's today. 4:30-8. so the whole not working this week is cool..but my paycheck is going to be shit.</P>
<P>and last night chase drove me to becky's. the whole way there all he could talk about was how much he wanted a crotch rocket. then he picked me up from becky's and told me he got to sit on one earlier in the night..start it up, and rev the engine. haha he was so excited. then <STRONG><FONT size=4>THE RESPONSE</FONT></STRONG> <STRONG>came on the</STRONG> <STRONG>radio</STRONG>..and i got so excited. aha</P>

tonight is that Rock Against Bush Tour thing. i don't think i'm going..but while we're on the topic of politics..i support the republicans. i don't like democrats because why the fuck should the people who work for everything in their life give up THEIR money that THEY worked for to help support those who do nothing?? and i don't like that we have to help pay the minorities way into college when over half of them either (1)fail (2)drop out or (3)don't continue after a year or semster.

i'm going out to eat with the kaskes in a bit..it's always fun to see audra and tegan go at it.

audra is going for chad scheffler..what the fuck.??

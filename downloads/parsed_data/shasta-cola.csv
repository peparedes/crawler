"event","Well.  That was silly.  Once I got my puter's clock straightened out, it messed up where my posts were posted.  You'd think they'd stamp your posts according to the server's clock, rather than my machine's.  But I digress.  The triumphant return to Murphy 130 found me taking a rather loooong French final.  Took me about an hour and a half to complete.  Not sweating it.  Only needed 53 of those 150 points.  

Lord of the Rings is out in theaters now.  I want to see it.  I also have a Philosophy final to write.  Can't do both.  Maybe tomorrow night I'll head out and see it?   Anna bought Moulin Rouge on DVD.  I love that movie.  So does she.  Makes me cry, every flipping time, though.  Hee.  Still, the MUSIC, man!  Fun stuff.

Um?  Hmm.  That's about it, really.  I'm sure I'll have more exciting things once finals are over."

"event","Today marks the day of my last final for Fall Semester.  Huzzah.  At 6:30pm tonight, in scenic Murphy Hall, I shall take my French Final and have done.  I could probably muster up more enthusiasm if I hadn't just woken up and gotten Rowan off to school after crawling into bed at 5am.  Ya think?

See, that previous paragraph is an example of why one should never write on too little sleep.  I'm not even sure what I meant by that, in hindsight.  I'm sure it was profound, whatever it was.  And if I hush up and act like I understand what I meant, maybe you'll believe me.  Heh.

I mailed my Philosophy TA.  Trying to get my grubby mits on the Final Paper topic.  That's due Thursday, and that's all I know about it.  Not cool.  I skipped out on Thursday's class, where they handed it out.  I was so tired, so anxious, I just didn't want to deal with it.  I can crap out a ten page Philosophy paper in one night, it's not that I'm worried.  I just want to get it and get it done.  The sooner this Semester is behind me, the better.

I sent the URL for my livejournal to Anna.  (Hi, Anna!  I love you!)  So.  Everyone say hello to Anna.  If you're nice to her, she might not resent the fact that you all knew about this before she did. =D

"event","Of course it's cool.  That totally came out wrong.  Heh.  I love Rowan dearly.  She's cute as all hell.  So.  To make up for my lack of paternal expression in that last post, I shall now dedicate this one to Rowan.  Ahem.

Rowan is exceptionally lucky.  In all respects.  She was a problem pregnancy, one that nearly killed her mother, and her.  She was born via c-section, which isn't unusual, save that her birth weight was a little under two pounds, she could wear her grandfather's wedding band as a bracelet, and was about the size of a cocker spaniel puppy.  She was born September 7th, she came home on October 31st.  Anna was only a friend then, and as I said, I wasn't the sperm donor, I'm just daddy.  I know all of this, only because I made it my fricking job to know everything I'd missed.  Her first word was 'dada'.  But she meant Diana, Anna's samoy/black lab mix.

I am, however, proud to say that I poddy trained her.  So there.

As a result of her premature birth, she has a low to mid range hearing loss in her left ear.  We monitor her hearing yearly, and there's been some degradation since we first began screening.  She's a clever girl, and uses her hearing loss as a very convenient excuse to ignore commands such as 'clean your room' and 'it's bedtime'.

""But, DAD-DEEEE!  I didn't HEEEEAR you!""

""I was speaking at your right ear, Ro.  Now go to bed.""

""Oh.  Right.  Okay...""

She's in dance, and gymnastics.  She draws me pictures.  Tonight, when I was on the phone with Jess, a friend of mine, she left a plate of orange balls and a letter at my computer.  'Orange balls for you, daddy!  I love you!  Love Rowan!'

She was reading before kindergarten.  Writing before kindergarten.  She knows what a condom is.  She knows that if someone asks her if she wants drugs she should say, 'Nawh.  I'm cool.'  She knows daddy once dated a boy.  She believes in God.

Can you -really- ask for much more than that?  I mean, come on.

My only complaint is that she's growing up so fast.  I used to complain that she'd run into our bedroom and climb in with us.  Now I miss it.  I used to complain that she wanted me to snuggle and cuddle with her at bed time.  Now I miss the fact that she's a big girl and only needs me to turn on the lava lamp to keep the mosters at bay.

But we have our little lie.  She always asks me to brush her hair.  She gives me hugs for every possible conceivable reason.  She sings songs with me when I drive her to school in the morning.  She's not perfect.  I'm not perfect.  But I like to think I'm doing okay by her.  I like to think I'm preparing her to be a good person, to make her own decisions, and to avoid the ones I made.

Thing is?  She teaches me a lot more than I teach her.  If you want to learn how you should be living your life, look at a seven year old.  They're masters of it.  In fact, it's my opinion that children are born knowing more than we know, and they just get stupid as adults mess up everything, make monstrous difficulties of what should be simple concepts.

She's my little girl, and I wouldn't trade that for anything.  I love her just the way she is.  I do, however, want a son.  I want to have a child with Anna.  She wants to have my baby.  Maybe it's selfish.  Maybe we should be content with what we have.  (And in the end, come what may, we will be.)  But I signed on for the dream, here.  Anything less is going to hurt.  That's the price of rampant idealism, I guess.

Anyhow.  Enough for one night, I think.  I must tell Anna about this!  She'll be thrilled to read my thoughts.  I hope."

"event","What a dumbass move that was.  My clock was somehow a day ahead of the actual day.  When I checked the date this morning, it said the 18th.  Ha.  Haha.  Ha.  So I went to take my final, and I walked in on a Journalism final.  That?  Was funny.  Still, I picked up my exam question for Philosophy, so it wasn't a total wash.  And I now know where my final is for tomorrow night.  It was like studying, only I was studying for how to get there.

Lord knows I aint studied otherwise.  Hee.

Anna was really pleased to find me writing again, and especially pleased to see me writing what I was really thinking and feeling.  I guess this means I haven't been as communicative with her as I should be.  That's the one thing I've always valued in our relationship, our communication.  Honest, of course, is another big one.  Mutual respect.  But... I guess, I've been trying really hard to be strong for her.  She needs to lean on me through all of this.  Like I've said before, it aint /my/ uterus they're staring at.  It doesn't do her any good for me to say that I'm scared, or say that I'm worried.  She can read it, she can know it, and we can both pretend it isn't there.  Call it denial, call it what you will, but it's working so far.

The last thing I want is to turn into captain sobbing wreck over all of this, and have her patting my head.  She's done enough of that for me over the years that I figure I can handle this one.  Typical male reaction to it all, maybe.  But... well... it's about time I did SOMETHING that was typically male, right?

Anyhow.  It's nice knowing she's reading this stuff.  Because I can sneak in horribly manipulative things like the following:

Give yourself a hug, woman!  For I do love you!

Hee.  See.  She'll get all teary-eyed at work over that.  Such is the power that I wield!

Tomorrow morning, same as this morning.  Get Rowan off to school.  Nap.  Study a little.  Poke at my Philo final, maybe work on the MUSH a bit.  RP some.  Watch a copious amount of Porn, what have you.  I'd better be careful, though.  This whole thing is beginning to sound strangely like a routine.

Oh, look.  3:30 am.  I should go to sleep.  Night, peeps."

"event","My friends signed on, and now I have, too.  It sort of works that way.  I've been woefully denying my writing journal lately, by a combination of factors that I'll no doubt detail as time goes by.  Suffice to say, my life hasn't been a big old bowl of cherries of late.  Head above water, currently.  Which is a new feeling.  I haven't felt this much relief for quite some time.  Despite the mood I've listed below, I'm actually rather sedate.  My annoyance doesn't stem from my old problems, only a new one.  Which is funny, since I'm not going to be writing about that just yet.

Last year, I don't even really accurately remember when, my fiancee's pap came back irregular.  That's not too uncommon.  They biopsied her cervix, the results were inconclusive, and so we figured the best.  Her next pap came back even more wildly irregular.  Category 5, which is more or less cancerous.  (Can something BE more or less cancerous?)  They performed a cryosurgery, where you freeze off the unhealthy cells.  All should have been well.  Yay, us.

Her next pap, still irregular.  Now they're concerned.  So now they perform what's called a cone biopsy of her cervix.  Not a cold knife procedure, they use coloscopy and a laser for this one.  They dye the cervix, healthy cells turn black, unhealthy ones remain pinkish, and they biopsy what they find.  Remove it.  Hopefully take care of the problem.

My fiancee's cervix, however, is a truly devious object.  It decided it would conceal much of its nasty cells in the interior lining of her cervix, around the glands that produce the mucous that makes pregnancy possible.  That's not where we wanted that problem to be located.  Still.  They perform a deep tissue biopsy, and now we wait three weeks.

I get to wait three weeks, she gets to wait three weeks, we pretty much sit around, waiting for three weeks, wondering if they'll take her uterus or not.

Did I mention we're getting married in April?  April 19th.  Hitler's Birthday.  It's an accident I assure you.  Everyone will be there.  We're being married by a good friend of ours, Daddy Dibble.  A tremendous person, on of my closest friends.  And he's like... three times my age.  He's like Santa Claus with a drinking problem. I love that man.

Still.  These aren't the things you want in your head around Final's Week, months before your wedding.  Radiation, Chemo, Hysterectomy.  Those are big words.  I should be worrying about Christmas, and what the daughter that we DO have will think about the upcoming holiday.  I just can't get my mind off of it, though.

It was nice having Anna come home and smile at me after the last procedure, though.  Nice that she laughed with me, nice that we got to cuddle.  (Even if the doctor assures me there's not to be any hanky-panky for a month.  Fucking doctors.)  I'm not worried that she'll die.  Cervical cancer only kills 1/30,000 women.  (Each a tragedy, don't get me wrong.)  But as cancer goes, it's eminently surviveable.

It's just going to take away the baby I didn't get to have with her.  Rowan's not mine, you see.  She is, but she isn't.  I wanted one more little squaller.  A boy, so that there wouldn't be any weird split of emotions.  Maybe this is God's way of telling me one is enough?  Hell.  I got to -choose- my daughter.  That's pretty cool, right?

Right?

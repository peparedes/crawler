"event","<p><br />so alonzo, it's been awhile since i last spoke to you. in secret and for real. not much has happened since then and now. i go to school and do my chauffeuring, the same ol' same ol'. but the beige walls of this apartment can only hold my contentment for so long. i began to grow restless and needed something ELSE&nbsp;to occupy my mind. i swear, i am like a hummingbird (not sure if its in a good way yet). <br /><br />so i decided to &quot;create a bit of mischief&quot; for myself (a lack of friends will do that to you :P). what kind of mischief you ask? i had no clue. but then i remembered i looked through these food blogs (Not Eating NY and&nbsp;Amateur G.)&nbsp;and decided to revisit them. <br /><br />and i am not afraid to tell you that i fell in love.<br /><br />i scowered them like nobody's business. and suddenly i was inspired. &quot;i want to cook&quot;, i said to myself. &quot;these are regular johns (and janes) so it can't be that hard&quot;. and im a strict recipe follower since im a noob. my dad says that's good w/ baking since its a science, but w/ cooking he just goes w/ the flow. i am not to that stage yet. oh but one can dream, alonzo, one can dream...<br />&nbsp;</p><p>so that's what i am doing. i ran out and borrowed 3 &quot;foodie&quot; books from the library and am working on cracking their eggs of knowledge as we speak. im almost done w/ the first one, it has its ups and downs. im more excited for the next one since its about the history of food in america (yes, i am a dork lol). i really want&nbsp;to learn about the chemistry of cooking and baking. i'm sure you're thinking, &quot;seriously? CHEMISTRY?!?! you are a super dork...&quot; i know. im surprised too. but i'm going with it. i LOVE&nbsp;alton brown and good eats so its like a given. science can be fun, especially when its about something as awesome as food!<br /><br />but aside from my foodiedom, i have nothing else going on. <br /><br />OH! dear alonzo how could i forget?! i wrote a COUPLE&nbsp;songs/poems!!&nbsp;and they're pretty good!! AND&nbsp;i vulnerably showed one to the old man(the least revealing and most cryptic) and he said it was good!! that made my day. gotta love positive reinforcement ;] i'm trying to get inspired to do that too (the recent bout was due to a very true and close to home postcard from PSecrets). i might try to get inspired from other &quot;you totally read my mind&quot; postcards and/or focus on the feelings my boys envoke in me. both should prove to be a good read...<br /><br />...hopefully...<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

"event","<br />I don't know whether to make this an open letter to Becks or to explain my feelings about a song. Both get the job done. I think i will do the open letter later. Right now, i need music.<br /><br />The first song is John Mayer's &quot;I&nbsp;Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)&quot;. I heard it again last night (early morning really) on Austin City Limits. I only watched it for him and his soulfulness. And my gosh is he amazing. People say he's a douche bag in disguise...i guess that's why i like him so much *eh*. Anyways, he played this song and the lyrics spoke to me (again). I had previously wasted the emotion of this song on Cheese. Now i waste it on Becks (haha...) <br /><br />Since its late, i won't go into a line by line breakdown of why the song is pertinent. So i will be forced to be general...and concise...<br /><br />The song bounces from general statements that ring true to what i would say/ my point of view. When Mayer says &quot;<strong>hold on to whatever you find baby, hold on to whatever will get you through, hold on to whatever you find baby, I don't trust myself with loving you</strong>&quot;, it is me telling Becks to hold on to the one he loves because i don't think i would be a better option/replacement. I&nbsp;would like to think that who he's with is crap and that i would &quot;treat him better&quot; and &quot;if he would only give me a chance&quot; blah blah blah. I&nbsp;am kidding myself. How can EYE give someone the love and attention they deserve when i can barely love myself? I&nbsp;think that's the key to this whole thing, i have to start loving myself again and stop wishing others will fill a void only i can fill myself.<br /><br />&quot;<strong>I will beg my way into your garden, and then i will break my out when it rains, just to get back to a place where i started, so i can want you back all over again, (i don't really understand)</strong>&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is so true. And very typical of me (and very Geoff-like). I&nbsp;will feverishly try to get you and then when i have you, i won't want you anymore and figure out a way to leave. And then when you're gone, i'll miss you and want you back. It's really annoying and mean. I don't like that i do it. But its something i &quot;can't help&quot;. I like the chase, a lot. So when that's over, you lose your luster. And i DON'T&nbsp;want to do that to Becks. I feel he deserves more than that, more than being a shiny toy at christmas. And the fact that i can't promise that won't happen, that i won't &quot;love him and leave him&quot;, upsets and saddens&nbsp;me.<br /><br />&quot;<strong>Who do you love?...Me or the thought of me?</strong>&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These questions are directed at me. I don't know who&nbsp;i love. Becks or the THOUGHT&nbsp;of Becks. Sadly i can answer that, the thought of him. I don't know him well. You can't know a person based on one-sided information. It doesn't work like that (to me). You have to be able to interact with them or you start to conjure up false hope. In my head, i have an IDEA&nbsp;of what Becks is like, who he is. But that doesn't mean it IS&nbsp;who he is. People can paint a picture of themselves that is entirely different from the real thing. Call me cynical, but for the most part it's true (haha). I trust that what he tells me is the truth, i mean why lie? But i need to be careful (personally) because i have a wicked imagination that can get away from me at times. I make people up to what i would like them to be in my head. So whenever i come across the real thing, i am sadly disappointed. And i have held Becks in such a &quot;high&quot; esteem that i don't want to see my mirror shattered....<br /><br />Thus i don't trust myself loving him. So badly do i think i can, that once i get in it that i'll put my whole heart into it because he deserves someone who will...but&nbsp;i don't know. I have to constantly hesitate and beware b/c right now it is impossible (another reason why i should just stop talking to him altogether). But i'm trying to have this &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; he keeps going on about so who knows.<br /><br />But that leads into the second song which is Paramore's &quot;I&nbsp;Caught Myself&quot;<br /><br />This is a new find (like brand spanking lol). It illustrates the hesitation i must have in order to avoid screwing things up too much. <br /><br />&quot;<strong>Now when i caught myself, i had to stop myself, from saying something that i should have never thought of you....Don't know what i want, but i know its not you, keep pushing and pulling me down, but i know in my heart it's not you</strong>&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I constantly have to keep myself from slipping it seems. We have such good convos. and like a girl, i drop subtle hints that i think are as clear as day, but of course i pride myself in being ultra vague. I should not be thinking we could be together, so i have to stop myself sometimes from hinting or alluding to such things. (its not THAT&nbsp;constant, i do have willpower for gosh sakes lol but sometimes he just gives me such &quot;good&quot; opportunities). I don't know what i want, and im like 80% sure its not him at all. We want different things in life and we are focused enough to actually go after those passions. Can 2 ppl in different directions meet up in the middle? sure, i never said an us was impossible, but right now we're not meeting and i know in my hear that its time for me to move on and forget this. Especially since i do want him to be happy and i doubt he would be happy w/ me.&nbsp;Too bad my insecurities get the best of me everytime...<br /><br /><em>you got it, you got it, some kind of magic, hypnotic, hypnotic, you're leaving me breathless, i hate this, i hate this, you're not the one i believe in...</em>"

"event","<br />My life right now can be summed up in an All Time Low (A&nbsp;Party Song [The Walk of Shame])&nbsp;and Amy Winehouse (Tears Dry on Their Own) song. <br /><br />its pretty ridiculous :P<br /><br />yesterday i told Becks that we needed a break. cause we do. this friendship is torturous...unrequited love is such a bitch :[ i know he loves his girlfriend and im happy for him about that. REALLY. but being there for him is making me hate myself. <br /><br />ok not really, but its making me feel bad. i am a constant flirt and i can't do that when they are taken but do to the magical power of relationships, i am drawn to him. and i hate myself for that. <br /><br />so i need a break. from him and his &quot;wonderfulness&quot;. i really must stop falling for the good guys. they get my in trouble lol <br /><br />i guess i should try to look forward to all the things that im about to go thru in the next couple days/rest of my life. i don't want to leave him behind b/c he really is an important part of my life. he's taught me so much!&nbsp;like how to hid my normal self lol (for the better i promise) he tried to teach me patience but i am not the patient type. (i did hold out for as long as i could tho. so he triumphed in that respect)<br /><br />its a struggle to not talk to him. which makes me seem desperate (something i also hate b/c im not nor am i needy but i can see how it could come across as that :[ which is also bad) <br /><br />once again i have become an emotional wreck over a kid and that's not cool. eff that schist lol<br /><br />it makes me incredibly girly which i never am.<br /><br />how we &quot;broke&quot; is interesting actually. i feel like i really hurt him. (can this be an arrogant, self-centered conclusion? yes but im emotional right now so let&nbsp; me have my moment, alonzo!&nbsp;lol) i swear it has nothing to do w/ my arrogance, but from a strictly psychological viewpoint. <br /><br />i told him i was starting a new life (which i am) but i tried to soften that statement by pointing out that so was he. so he replied with a &quot;cheerful&quot; <em>no worries, enjoy your new life</em>. then he comments on something else i wrote (the first line of the chorus lyrics to the ATL song) with the rest of the chorus, <em>i make you come just to watch you leave you walk around with my heart on your sleeve don't sweat it its over now our time ran out.</em><br /><br />this could mean he is hiding his true emotions thru the lyrics (like i am lol) but a flag goes up as if to question if he is that clever (lol). not that he's not, its just he's not as metaphorical as i am so would he even do something like that, ya know? and the more i think about it the more i want that to be the answer. its still a melancholy ending but it makes me feel better b/c i would know i was right...<br /><br />therefore, i am overreacting and it is nothing of the sort. :[ <br /><br />why is this so hard alonzo? emotional breaks are worse than physical ones. and he was my favorite one haha son of a biscuit....guess i should just get over him....like i always do when i get over ppl. bottle it up and leave it alone :P <br /><br />its for the best..."

"event","back so soon?

yes. 

because this is serious. 

what the hell has happend to the people i used to know and love? sure. im 4 years too late on the scene but still, i can be pissed about it if i want to. 

Words can't even describe how i feel right now....like they really can't i don't know how to put this into clauses and phrases that would even make any sense....

all the ppl i used to know back in what i would fondly call my &quot;home country&quot; have severely changed. and none of it good.

sure, i don't know the whole story right now. nor will i be getting the complete real story since it will come from a 2nd or 3rd person. 

but the fact still remains that they have changed. they are no longer the kiddies i knew and loved.&nbsp;

to put it in a metaphor&nbsp;(*smile*): me and the old&nbsp;kiddies were all&nbsp;catepillars. happy lil buggers, just squirmin around and havin a good ol time. but then we started to change, slowly but surely, into cacoons. happy in our little cacoons we stayed til the time came when we would all become butterflies together, or so&nbsp;i thought. but all of a sudden, my cacoon gets shipped off to another branch leaving everybody else to their own devices. it was a sad time but eventually we all got over it. hatched, made new friends, etc. occasionally i would come back to the old branch and see my old friends as glorious butterflies. What could ever be the matter with this story you ask? I'll tell you. My old friends didn't all turn into butterflies. on the contrary, most of them are moths with paint on them made to look like butterflies....

and that my dears, is the distressing part.

and i know i shouldn't judge them. 
(i mean my whole motto for life is Milkshakes Melt, People Change, for crying out loud)
but if that's the case, why do i still feel like i have no more friends in that world. 

(also, this prolly explains why i could never get down there for college, i was trying to go back and reconnect with all the ppl i loved but now i realize all the ppl i loved are no longer there. and what's left is a troupe of strangers right b4 my eyes. that's why it never seemed to be working out, it just wasn't meant to be. why didn't i see that earlier? :P)

so yeah. i just feel really sad and lonely. like i should just abandon florida b/c it will just remind me of them. i want to hang on more to the friends ive made here and just&nbsp; say my final goodbyes to the ppl there. 

but that feels like a semi lie. 

i guess i have to clear my head of all the memories i used to have w/ those ppl and start anew. meet them like strangers on the street for the first time. i still love them to death, but its not the real them. its the fake them. i love the paint i guess...

what also really bothers me is why they didn't think to confide in me either. like i ask them how's it going, what's up and they all just reply &quot;nothing, what's new w/ you?&quot;. were they embarrassed? did they not think i could handle it? little did they know i was getting much crazier stories from a girl i can proudly call my best friend. but even she has changed. for the better? idk...

now i no longer look at them as friends, but as ppl in a story that i used to read. 

now i want to analysis them, ask them questions like they are sometime to interrogate.

now i don't have friends, just familiar strangers..."

"event","(there's a song by christina aguilera, and that's how the chorus goes lol) 

but it true. i do feel this way. 
and i don't know why exactly... 
could it be that whenever my friends have something weighing on them they come to me and i eagerly listen and am concerned and understanding. but when it comes to my term, oh no!&nbsp;time's up! they have to go...or they generally listen and feign interest in my problems even though i just spent 2 hours with them working out theirs.... 
yeah, maybe that's it. 

im tired of &quot;giving more than i receive&quot;, as the song goes. 
i just want to be genuinely listened to sometimes. 
is that so much to ask? 

because i've waited to long to type this out, i really don't have much to vent about now. i've already thought everything thru but im still troubled by it. it seems this is just a passing phase not really worth mentioning since i have a physics term paper i need to be researching for and typing up. instead i'm talking to you alonzo. cause you seem to be the only one with ears ready enough to hear me. i know im not giving those in my life enough credit because when i need them, they do return the favor. i guess its just at THIS&nbsp;moment, when i feel i need them the most, they aren't there. so it's hitting kind of hard. and i know they have their on problems to deal with. they don't need to hear my usual song and dance (im like a walking routine of emotions). so i really i have nothing to complain about. i know... 

yesterday was a bit strange in the fact that i opened my heart to cheese. and it wasn't that bad. 
all i told him was something that i've been struggling with lately: 

.....L O&nbsp;N&nbsp;E&nbsp;L&nbsp;I&nbsp;N&nbsp;E&nbsp;S&nbsp;S..... 

it really does suck. 
but i guess this is just part of my cyclical life. 
i do get this way on occasion. 
right now, i feel like everyone around me has &quot;someone to love&quot; and i look at myself and wonder what the hell is wrong with me? then like a [person or object that knows a bunch of answers], i answer my own question. i've concluded that it is because i am too awkward to occupy another person's existence. im not even too comfortable in my own skin. sometimes i get really depressed (like now) and sometimes i don't know how to interact with another human being, socially and especially not romantically (cause im awkward). my nerves play a part in it too. i get really nervous around people and get really weird (i hate that i am painfully aware of this too). but yeah i have a lot of things to get over that normal people have gotten way over by now. i keep thinking that all i need is a guy who is super patient and tolerant and then maybe i can sort these things out and be worthy of a normal homo&nbsp;sapien. alas, i do not think i am worthy of anyone so that's the first hurdle i need to tackle... 

i don't know why im being so negative right now. 
im usually not 
i usually try to be some kind of positve 
(at least that's what i do for my friends...) 
and yet i can't even do that for myself 
what the hell, Self? 
per usual, i'll just shut myself out and bottle all these emotions and thoughts into&nbsp;another can and call it square pegs... 
that's how i get on with my life. 
its always a lot simpler that way: 

never really address the problem, 
skip that step, 
and just move on...."

"event","[&nbsp;again i got erased so of course i am pissed ]<br /><br />[ but whatever ]<br /><br />i have no clue what to feel right now with my life. its going great b/c of Helicopter Boy (he's sweet, amazing, funny, not too shabby in the visuals lol he's like perfect as far as i can tell, which makes me nervous like What The Hell Is Wrong With This Boy? but im enjoying the change of scenery, as are all of my friends. their happy for me and everything :D lol i can't help but grow a big smile on my face whenever i talk to him or about him. my friend said i must be happy since i got really girly and talked about nothing but him for 30mins straight haha guess i am happy finally for the first time in a long time...and im not afraid to admit that either...its kinda scary too....see what i mean?! girly! how can i be a girl-boy when i get all girly over a boy. not cool man haha).<br /><br />but that fun happy sprinkle in my life, is always tainted by Captain Bitch Tits. But i let him taint it so its partially my fault. its his fault for always being so damn available like that! he's like a freakin Quagmire!! ugh...but i toy with him like crazy (point for&nbsp;me [being at fault]) i don't try to tho. like its not <em>always</em> delibriate. 99% of the time he pushed me to do it. playing two girls off of each other is bullshit. especially when their like best friends. dude, no. u can't have ur cake and eat it to, that's super bullshit.<br /><br />ok i just watched family guy and now im no longer inspired to write anymore emotions (lol) so that's the drift of what im feeling&nbsp;<br /><br />Thank You, Come Again<br /><br />:o) haha"

"event","<p>so i just got back from my school's musical, Wasteland. and holy shitake it was good. the cast was great (including my buddy geoff pole), the songs were awesome (and so was the choreography lol). all in all it was a great play. the plot was, by far, stupendous and...real. very true to life, which i love. i could relate to it A LOT and so could a lot of people. movies &amp; books and other forms of media that i can relate to or see myself in or really speaks to me, make me happy all in one.&nbsp;<br /><br />this may not make sense b/c i am filled w/ emotion at the time. so bear with me<br />and so help me Gosh if it does not save/work right...<br /><br />anyways, the musical was about life after college. which could actually apply to a lot of after things in life (ie life after high school, getting fired, etc etc). its basically a play about what to do next? totally the thing to do right now, for everybody (juniors ---&gt; me) and the ppl in the play (juniors and seniors).<br /><br />it got me thinking about my future and my life and what to do next. and im still confused as fuck. but know i re-reknow that its ok to be confused. actually, the play taught me that taking longer than a summer to figure out what i want to do in my life is ok, its normal, everybody does it. even the ppl who you think know what they want to do, they are just as confused as the rest of us.&nbsp;<br /><br />then again they could be worse off in the long run. like, what if life doesn't lend itself to their plans? what if everything doesn't go as smoothly as they thought it would? what if...? that could be detremental to their entire world. their psyche will collapse in a fit of chaos. they might even give up on life itself and try to kill themselves (*reference*), which is very extreme but highly plausible.&nbsp;<br /><br />my dad, at intermission, wanted to blow off James's anger at the world and say that it was his fault and he shouldn't be mad at everybody else. which i think is utter bullshit. James should be allowed to be angry. being set up by the world only to be crushed by reality later is a valid reason to be upset. having emotions is a good thing. its normal. not having them or saying ""its not the right time to have them"" or ""not the right response"" is total crap. because then the question is ""when is a good time?"" since when do you have to schedule an appointment for your heart? if that's the kind of life that i have to live, count me out.<br /><br />emotions should be an ""in the moment"" occurance not something to bottle up and save for later.&nbsp;<br />(and yes that is ME saying that. funny how things turn around huh? guess im...what do u call it?...<strong>growing</strong>)<br />but w/e...<br /><br />hmm...i wanted to get this stuff in my head out. but im not doing a very good job. i think im gonna stop now. this is good enuff. its a swirl of comments so we'll just call it a day.<br /><br />Buenos Dias...</p>"

"event","this will be an intermission of sorts&nbsp;between my usual gripings about a certain person and my usual pining away at something or someone.&nbsp;<br /><br />right now i just feel like a stressed ball of shit that's floating through her daily life. so much pressure is being applied that i hope i turn into a diamond when all this is over. i can't wait til spring break! i don't care where i go, what i do. as long as its out of this effin state!!! i'll gladly ride a plane if i know its going to touch down somewhere WARM or at least SANS SNOW! sheesh...<br /><br />on to a couple of the things that are stressin me out:<br /><br />at the top of the list is of course my <u>social situations</u>. when i fix one door another one falls off. i'm over my weekly period stint w/ Natalie (that's going to confuse the shit out of my later when i read this and not know who im talking about....but i digress...) but am now having probs with Annabel. its always between those two. its a bitch, to say the least. &nbsp;Natalie can still be annoying sometimes, so im not fully over it. i'm at the 96% over it mark; but we stil got that 4% so its not all gone. but me and Annabel are...wow. so wow that this calls for a new paragraph...<br /><br />me and Annabel are growing apart at a faster pace than i expected. and im starting not to care if we come out of this burning building alive or not. it makes no diff to me. however, whenever we are 2gether, i dispise her b/c of various reasons (ie she's snarky, she's like me, she's just plain annoying). its annoying (haha). but when she's not w/ me, i keep referencing her (ie ""ooo i gotta tell Annabel this"" or ""i gotta show Annabel that""). its enough to make a kid even more sick in the head than she already is. i think im tired of her predictability. THAT ALWAYS GETS ME IN THE THIRD YEAR!!! i hate this stupid curse. cuz i always feel bad about being this way....it blows <em>major</em> chunkage.<br /><br />so now im forced to go through life, AGAIN, floating around like i have no friends. i'm just kind of on the outside looking in, wishing somebody would change the music of this party. i want to go back to the last 2 years, when things were fun and less annoying (lol) i was HAPPY?! and life wasn't so bloody difficult. :o/<br /><br />but then i wouldn't be growing up now would i? its like the levels of a video game: as the level increases, so does the difficulty.&nbsp;<br /><br />i just...im lost again :( &amp; i really hate this. i hate my bipolar mood swings. its causes me to lose those i end up caring about but i don't know that until they're gone...i tried to explain my new thinkings to heather; &amp; even tho they were still little buds, when the words passed from my lips&nbsp; they even&nbsp;felt wrong &amp; mean &amp; selfish. (oh gosh i hate that word...if i want to think about myself from time to time by gosh let me! and keep the judging to yourself :P)&nbsp;<br /><br />ergh....i think i just need another break from these ppl. (HELLO SPRING BREAK!) i need to get away and just relax. i think the other stressors are making me cranky, thus i get ezly annoyed with my friends even tho i don't mean to....lets hope that's it at least...<br /><br />the second stressor is <u>school/academics/sleep</u>. im sure you're like ok , i can see the first two, but the 3rd one? que? por que? well. they do end up coinciding. school and my other academic responsibilities are stressing me out and weighing me down. i have harder classes and i think that is adding to my ""i can't take this anymore"" mentality. &amp; I HATE THIS TOO! its ridiculous. i now see that if i don't SERIOUSLY get my act together, i'm going to fail college. and that's not drama talking, that's the practical side talking. the reality of the situations. my study habits are atrocious. i'm lazy as fuck. and i procrastinate like a mothertrucker. *bleh* i'm trying to do better. like im THINKING about starting stuff before the day before its due....hey! its a start :) sleep ties in to all this because since im trying to do better in my classes --&gt; i study more --&gt; this might require some late nights --&gt; thus a shortage of sleep so im cranky and super stressed out b/c im tired as eff! so see? it all comes together in the end.<br /><br />i think <u>parents/family</u> can also be added to the list even tho they are a rather mild stressor right now. but that doesn't mean they can't get crazy. i predict some crazyness to ensue in the next couple of weeks seeing as how we r getting a new addition to the household...<br /><br />some things that are ruining my life tho:<br /><br />the<u> internet</u> (case in point *looks around* uh...yeah...) and <u>college</u> (this ties into school and such so its a double whammy, a stressor and ruiner of lives)<br /><br />i tink my rant is just about over. the points i wanted to cover are in there to some degree of importance and sensicalness.&nbsp;<br />i gotta sleep<br />""cuz im rather sleepy...""<br />guten nacht (?)&nbsp;<br />;o)"

"event","&nbsp;im not too sure about what to do anymore. eh...but what else is new? just when i thot my life was looking up and my happy meter was rising; it all comes to a crashing halt. i've been analoging it to a ship which has sailed, been&nbsp;devoured by the Kraken, then ran into an iceburg. it's slowly sinking as we speak. and the longer i stall, the worse it gets.&nbsp;

to me at least...i feel kinda helpless in the situation. i want to accept that the ship's going down and move on, but my friend is trying to deter me from that conclusion. and a part of me doesn't really want to give up. that part wants to try again to see if we can fix the mess im in. however, that's like 5% of me against the other 90. the other 5% just doesn't give a shit. (lol)

its an emotional situation which is buggin the crap outta me b/c i don't really know what i want to do about things. (ie it concerns a guy duh! lol) emotions are tricky things. they are never black&amp;white, always shades of grey. therein i am all over the place with these things.&nbsp;basically, when i first met him i was really happy, confused, but happy. like i didn't know if i liked him like THAT&nbsp;yet&nbsp;;o) so i&nbsp;was just gonna play it by ear. i was logical in the&nbsp;whole thing. ""he's not even that cute, don't get too bent out of shape about it. your just making a new friend. new friends are exciting""&nbsp;

NEVERTHELESS, i did a capital job of screwing things up between us by being my awesome, nerdy, studious self. i get so absorbed and panicked in&nbsp;my endeavors to not fail that&nbsp;i lost touch with reality. i wish i could explain that to him....but i can't not anymore. cause im pretty sure he&nbsp;hates me. i've had soooo many opportunitys to change this but i've&nbsp;let them all pass by me. i realise that the moment existED, and make up an excuse as to why i let it pass. i'm pretty pathetic, i know...

i just want him to talk to me again i guess. im a sucker 4 a high--an emotional high. &nbsp;im starting to realize i get addicted to the happy feelings someone gives me and not necessarily the person. they matter at the time, but afterwards...i crave the emotions i experienced. it's putry messed up haha but that's a new revelation so it's still in the workings.

i know what i need to do to fix my situation. i need to talk to him. strike up conversation somehow. im good at planning those things out in my head so hopefully things go okay.&nbsp;

i don't need him to like me, i just want things between us to be cool....&nbsp;
yeah, that's it...."

i'm stoked to say the least.&nbsp;

However, there's a cloud&nbsp;looming over my head,&nbsp;preparing to cause a downpour.
That cloud being a certain person i've had my eye on lately...kinda.
idon'tknow...its complicated
*chuckles*&nbsp;
yeah what else is new?

i just wish...i knew how i felt about him.&nbsp;like really.&nbsp;im still in the Confusion stage, where you think you like somebody but you're not quite sure yet. im beginning to think that we might be friends at least. and i think that might be really cool too. *shrugs* i'm making things way too serious in my head. that's my problem...that's prolly why im in the pickle im in.&nbsp;

It has dawned on me, thanks to my friend, that he thinks i'm ignoring him...maybe. either way, its not good. i'm not ignoring him. or not trying to...argh! i can't help that i focus grossingly on my studies and block out everything else. i can't help that i'm not an outgoing person who talks to people in the morning like he does. im just not social....especially when im freaking out about school.&nbsp;

i wanted to make things right today, but...they was a no-go. i kept missing my opportunities. *sigh* i'm such a loser. i kill things before they even have a chance to live. we've talked all of...2, serious, one-on-one times. and those were nice...like really cool. the kind of convos i wouldn't&nbsp;mind having more of once and awhile. the pointless, thought-provoking, occasionally deep conversations that we all know and love. haha.

...argh! i hate being this way...obsessing that is. i need to...forget. about him, about emotions, about the people who take up my life...that's y im looking forward to this break so much. whether they believe it or not, my family keeps me sane. *smirks* i retreat into them @ just the right times so i can forget about everything. that is...until grades are calculated and posted. *bleh*

but whatever. i&nbsp;need to go plan...and knit. can i help that Degrassi is so addicting?&nbsp;

"event","oh alonzo, sometimes i wish you were real. (haha) yesterday was full of highs and lows. i'd like to forget about the angry jealous part (the movies) and the hyper unnecessary part (the coffee) and forcus on what happened after all that.&nbsp;

that night, i looked up at the stars for the first time in...years. and it was AMAZING! but not just amazing, like better than amazing. exhilarating? or some other fancy word that means something better than that even. *sigh* it was just wonderful. and it was then that i realized what i&nbsp;wanted in life...somewhat. i couldn't do a full on amazed wonder like i would have liked to b/c i was in a car&nbsp;at the time and there were streetlights getting in the way. but if i was able to ponder the full&nbsp;glory of the time, then i would have been able to sort out all the things that were going on in my life.&nbsp;alas, i could only lick the surface.&nbsp;

and that surface includes&nbsp;an aspect of&nbsp;what&nbsp;my ideal person would be.&nbsp;here's what i was able to come up with: we would lay on the beach&nbsp;and have an intellectual and philosophical discussion about life and everything. nerdy, i know. (haha) but we'd also listen to music that we are both into, sing along, maybe they'd play me a song on thier acoustic guitar and it would be momentary bliss. then the clicheness of the mood would set in and i think you can guess what will happen next. let your imaginations roam asunder. (haha)

and all this by looking up at the night sky. i am awesome

and that is when everything decided to go downhill. and i find myself helping my ex hook up with another girl. not so awesome. i wish i was so paranoid about this, cause when he told me then asked for my help, it felt way too weird and...scripted? like it was so storybook it was crazy. at least the things he said were. thanks for ruining my good mood...so now i need to figure out a way to ask someone who im not too incredibly close with what they think of him. this is not my thing. i wish i wasn't the person doing it. if it was happening, ok w/e but now that im apart of the thing, i hate it.&nbsp;

he's the 2nd one to fall for her. im just waiting til the day i realize that i'm the one who is also madly in love with her.&nbsp;

Cheese is ""back and better than ever!"" haha
our convo last night to the early morning was quite enjoyable...
i just wish i wasn't an anxious tardface who is paranoid of his motives.
but maybe i have a right to be?

he never did anything ""bad"" to make me skeptical of him or anything,
its just dude, i don't want to have sex with you. period.&nbsp;
haha
i mean how many times do i have to say it to get it thru to you?
and i hate how vulnerable i make myself&nbsp;
so that people like him can prey upon me and use me/ my emotions to their advantage
but when i try to do the same, i feel horrible.
guess that's the diff b/w u and me kiddo...

people have THE best timing when it comes to walking into my life
the plot always twists when i least expect it.&nbsp;
""but i thot you were dead Johnny? i saw you fall off that cliff 5 months ago! how can this be?"" ""well im back baby! and im ready for action!""
i secretly love it, don'tcha know.&nbsp;
it helps me keep my mind off of some things. helps me to redivert my attention.
this could be good or bad depending on the situations at hand.&nbsp;

like at the time of our convo, i was writing a history essay.&nbsp;
i took a 2 hour assignment and stretched it out to about 5 or so.&nbsp;
its ridiculous i know...
{i forgot to get words together for this team im on... &lt;-- i just remembered lol}

shit on a stick mateys.&nbsp;
i'd like my life to, for once, not spiral downward&nbsp;
and upwards spiral would be nice every now and again...

i could've cut his fucking testicals off. luck for him, he doesn't have any.

such a fucking bitch....

i think the SUPER final straw for me has been a) he's a ""louse and a weasel"" as my friend calls him b) his personality couldn't charm its way out of a paper bag [and ya kno what? ur not even that cute!! only with curly hair can you look at all kind of decent and you don't even KEEP IT THAT WAY!!!] and c) my clueless friend started to catch on, and when HE catches on, you know its gone on too long

so yes, ""im supah thru wit you""&nbsp;

i know its going to be hard. i'll have 2 major tests of will power. i dunno, i think i'm fairly strong. but who knows. it could all come crashing down. then again im a competitive lil monkey and hate losing.....if i crack/break down, he would've won.....and i hate that bitch so he's goin down!!&nbsp;

well i don't do nothing, persay
i sit and work in this sweatshop i've created for myself
making clothes and other things
for myself and the friends who have lives
and reading...

repetition is not in my blood

so i keep sitting
throwing myself a little pity party&nbsp;
table for one
and writing to you alonzo,
my&nbsp; beautiful listener (hehe)

gosh im pathetic
please,&nbsp;
someone stop me
eh..."

make it stop...
i can't take it anymore
i don't want to feel like this anymore
i just want him to...
i don't know what
i don't want him to leave
because i'm a selfish whore
i dunno...
he doesn't need permission from me

i didn't mean to put you through this hell

"event","dear alonzo...where have we gone wrong? i used to be so...different. hmm...maybe i am beginning to grow up? finally leaving the comforts of adolescence and entering...well, what do you call this? this period of self-discovery and maistakes. 

i call it life. ""Hello world! nice to meet you!"" 

sometimes i wish i could be as introspective as talia. able to make mistakes and learn from them. all i do is make mistakes and learn after the 3rd or 4th time. *sigh* i'm not too fluid with my words as i would like. i can never voice my feeligs. its hard. but at least i try.

i have nothing worthwhile going on in my life right now and that's depressing. i could never enjoy a vacation without the company of others. i get so bored by myself. just knowing somebody is THERE for you is a good thing. security is a good thing nowadays. 

*sigh* i don't feel like writing nemore. too tired. so i guess i'll continue later maybe

til then,
chaio."

But because of this you let yourself be influenced by other people, and you let other people take over your personality so much that you begin to give up on yourself. You should realize that you can count on your friends to make up for the absence of your family in your daily life... that's what my horscope said for me today. so thank you friends. and omgiggelidy gosh the rest of it is tru. :o( anyway, im makin some KA oatmeal cookies. and i almost let the awexome big one burn to death, luckily i saved it just in time. i saw Andrew again later on friday. and he drove me, my sis and his cuz to get some gangsta ice cream. it was fun. his step dad was drunk and it was still light outside. but he was ""funny to listen to him slurr his words and not make since"" drunk so it was all good. i'd like to ONCE stay over there for a whole day, that'd b kick ass to the extreme!! oh well. oh and i got to c my auntie. i gotta help her w/ algebra its a lovely altenative than my gma. i really do love Chicago. its just something bout the way u can almost get shot...idk im so wonderful, NOT!</P>
<P>&nbsp;<U>mondai the 25th</U>: OMG! I LOVE THIS CHICA!!!! she is the awesome of the awexomest! who am i talking about? why none other than my bestest buddie who a love to the ne plus ultra extent: ANNA BERNSTEIN yesh anna, i got the package 2dai, and i LOVE LOVE LOVE my new shoelaces. that's what i'm talkin about gurlie!!! im was so excited when i saw them. they are just what i need to stick the middle finger to these annoying pplz. the love vibes that im exuberating ta ya sista can't be put into words. just know that i love my gift. YAY!!! okie dokies then, oh i have contacts now. did i tell u all that. and OMF (oh my fosh) kappy don't need contacts. it took me 30mins just to put em in @ the eye doctor's. the lady said some ppl take up to 2HOURS. and i was like ""forrill? wowzers..."" so yeah, i think i look really weird w/o my glasses. i always thot they made a person look more intelligent. plus they exentuate my eyes, the only lovely feature i have. so with no raphaels, my face looks naked. like an ass. (lol) oh well, we'll c. i really want the colord ones tho. dunno if i'll b able to get em *sigh* oh! and my nu prescription is like WHOA!! different. like i have magnifying glasses on or sumthing. my vision goes blurry and ultra clear in and out-like. so...that;s the updizzle. i'll put an editorial like my buddie justin does up later. -*~HUGS NOT DRUGS~*- ps- chrisizzle, when is ur b-dai. the names r for a month. usually for they birthday month; some get bumped off. so yeah that's how its goin dwn... </P>

(that goes for boys and girls)</P>
<P>boys have it the worst it seems. they can't have goatees, which i find totally awexome to the extreme. their sideburns hafta b no longer than their earlobs and their bangs can't be below they eybrows. </P>
<P>what if they trying to grow they bangs out? uh oh didn't think bout that one huh?</P>
<P>anyway, there's other crap that is too excessive for me to put. oh well. i have a feeling ima b in detention <U><EM>A LOT</EM></U> then eventually put out. how sucky huh? *crosses fingers* i shall try to contain myself i guess. *gags*</P>
<P>otai enuff of that talk. </P>
<P><STRONG>""this might just be a waste of time/ but there's no one i'd rather waste my time with than all my best friends. so start the car up./ we'll all take turns but not for the worst. we're all ""has-beens"" and ""never-were's"" and we're all in the back singing ""roxanne"", just watching life pass us by. pass us by....""&nbsp; --the world's not waiting (for 5 tired boys and a broken down van)</STRONG></P>

"event","that's right. as you have guessed from the title of this lil entry, i have been suffering from a slight case of insomnia. or maybe you didn't guess cause your a stupid foo'! eather way, i needs the help. i can't stand the tossing and turning until like 1 in the am. that's how long it took me to get to sleep yeasterdai. that is so un-awesome.

but with this new found disorder i am able to fill ya'll (how country of me :]) in on the happenings of me. 

well 2dai i had to endure the innerworkings of the catholic school system. meaning, my school had a ""picnic"" orientation crap thing. in which the parents got a chance to meet and greet one another and the students got to check out their fellow alumni. YaY! *gag* i got course just stood there talking to like no one, but got intro'd to 3 kids out of the 45 or so that was there. 

OH! and speaking of arrivals. i must be cursed to never show up anywhere at the pre-selected time, b/c we (tha family) showed up an hour late, as usual. but that's ok cause it wasn't that intresting anyway. so i guess we saved ourselves from a lot of boredom. go us! (lol) 

anyway, i really have been looking forward to updating my journal, unfortunately i am coming up with a mind road block. oh w8! i had a dream in which my homie-to-the-extreme, diana, was present. she had sent me sumthing via a electronic device (ie the comp) and it was like picture mail. she was talking to me, tres coolio, no? and her brother nicky popped up during the video feed also. 

well it just so happend that an episode of DORA THE EXPLORER was on. and also by chance my whole dream was w/ diana as Dora talking spanish and Nicky playing the part of Boots (i have him on my shoelaces. luv that monki!) so them tlking was wat Dora and Boots were saying, get it? (i hope so) basically my dream was a Dora the Explorer episode. it was hilarious. i believe Talli was in it too, as one of the people off to look for sumthing. i vaguely remember a bridge, some body of water, and a gate. 

yesh yesh, good times had by all. :)

i shall leave now, off to do something to help my fall asleep. maybe i'll paint the house, or maybe jus the walls. maybe i'll learn some triginometry, but i seriously doubt that. eather way, ima be up for awhile. who knows what i'll get myself into..."

"event","<P>i love how i can b so dramatic sumtimes, but here's the entry on my xanga just reposted: </P>
<P><STRONG>tis funny how depressed i am over something that wasn't. but that's a perfect reason to be depressed. i lost someone that i could have loved very deeply and visa versa. but ""we shall nvr see each other again since we're going to different schools"" life sucks like a mofo. i want it to die! y oh y did i go and fall in love on the last day of school? maybe it wasn;t meant to be. but i don't believe that bullshit......not one bit i h8 being paranoid. i gotta do something about it, but what i ask myself? what the hell can i do?</STRONG> </P>
<P>max and i r attracted to each other. but we come to realize this on the last day of school. he wants to just give up while i want to see what can happen. i don't like to give up hope too ezly. yd (june 9th) he was all deep and philosophical it was awesome. big time arousal! (lmao jk) he's like the perfect package 4 me or sumthing. and i lost him. DAMNIT! i want to just crawl under a rock and sleep/cry *tears*</P>
<P>wow this is so mushy, even 4 me. it was just sumthing about him that.....made me feel good inside. and i like that feeling since it comes around so rarely. just being around him made me feel all funny inside. (i can't believe im saying such cliche things! grr!) but a good kinda funny. a funny that i want to keep 4ever. i hate thinking and wishing ""<EM>what could have been</EM>"" when i was so close to <U>knowing. </U>sometimes i wish i wern't so corny and cliche. lol even this entry is making me seem ""lame"". but isn't love annoying neway?</P>
<P>""a person who refuses to fall in love, is a dumbass""</P>

going to the formal, doing the track thing. all would b good times. *sy* maybe in college we'll all get together, @ least around this time we'll b able to drink and go to pimpin sweet parties. *smls* oh yeah...
anywayz, i guess that's it. i planned a long entry, but im all tired out. its 12:26 and i have to get up @ 6 or 7am. bloody hell. lol ok well 

g'nite!

i may even name my journal just like talli's done, cause she's an ultra cool trend-setter. :o) but what to name it, and would it be a boy or girl or it? oh the things to ponder. i guess i'll dream of this then."

"event","OMG! its been too long since i've last updated this. as u can guess i've been kickin it up on my xanga. and the most tragic unawesomeest thing has happened: im moving back to the old country.

AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! oh yesh u herd rite. im moving. but no tears now cause i don't wanna tlk bout it now. its amazing how much u mean to ppl when ur about to go. its like i unhinged everything ppl were in TEARS over ME! i couldn't believe that. i nvr knew i meant that much. that i was worth that much. im totally wow'd and that makes me not wanna leave more. but anyway. 

i wanna tlk about guys right now. *smls* im in the same f'n boat as nat-nat. i want a guy so bad since e'rybody else around me seems to have one. im just caine the lil loser who nobody loves. which i kno is untrue cause there was once somebody who really did love me an di let him go. let him slip right thru my fingers 4 some other lil fucker who may or may not like me. i let him play me like his f'n piano, well no more cause im, seriuosly, outta here.  

i can't believe i even let him do that to me eather. i was such a fool. blinded by lust i guess. even tho now i (frend) love him. im such a messd up lil peeble. its so ishtar. i promise not to let myself do that again, get blinded. but really, how long would that promise last? not very long. i was even gonna get hooked up by him w/ his frend. how dysfunctional is that? his frend sounded cooler neway. *smls*

but my whole relationship with my frends and humans of the male gender is dysfunctional. mostly with the guys. guys r so weird. especially the 2 guys im dealin w/. george and logan. the 2 bayholes of my life. love em to death, but goshums i wanna kill 'em. lol george more than logan. @ least logan loved me. george sorta likes me one minute, doesn't like me the next. i h8 the way he plays with my emotions. he's such a bitch. but a the bombizzle of a frend. lol i keep contridicting myself by sayin i hate him but i love him @ the same time. 

logan is lovely and great. he might go w/ D and to that i say go ahead. if ur nu 2 this, logan is my ex. he'll prolly be my favortie ex of them all. lol now i sound like a ho. ok ok i sorta wish i was (a lil and 2 and extent) cause the hoes seem to have all the fun. rotfl! jk jk jp jp. i just need to get myself out there for all the guys. *sy* maybe if i had more damn EXPERIENCE i wouldn't be so hesitant. cho wells, i guess i'll leave now cause i sorta don't make sense. check out my xanga 4 the real updation or @ least a more throurgh one. 

im off to have a cookie..."

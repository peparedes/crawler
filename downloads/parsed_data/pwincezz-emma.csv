"event","Today we went to Westfield shopping center and it was boring...
we were GOING to see a movie (probably a tiny little child's one) but because my sister Aimee chucked a spastic we had to go *angry*
I did get some gummi bracelets and a big yummy pretzel but yeah that's all that happened :(
My brother and his girlfriend and their babies James and Caitlin went to Harbourtown and my bro's gf got me a kool denim jacket! :D
I gotta go now... BYE!"

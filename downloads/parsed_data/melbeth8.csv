"event","well, that's a bit of wishful thinking. but that is what song was just on, and it always gets me in a certain mood...spunky, i think. :)

so it's been, um...FOREVER...since i posted on here. and i kind of feel the way you feel with a long-distance friend: it's pointless, since you very rarely see each other, to try to convey the minutae of every day to them, so you just cover the big stuff. here it is:

i hate my job.
i have no time for anything else.
i have cabin fever. :)

that's not exactly the truth of the situation, though. i'm finding a lot of joy in the challenges of work (at least in my head i'm finding the joy...my literal experience is a whole other story) and in personal relationships. life really is good right now. 

and right now i'm dressed in my funky going out clothes (including a sweet new hat...laugh if you will, julie) and am ready to get my freak on. 

see you soon!"

"event","things have been...crazy.

it's been awhile since i've updated, and since then i've gone through a week of pre-planning for school and am staring down the barrel of the ""first day of school"" gun, so to speak. i suppose, though, that that metaphor would indicate that it's something i'm dreading...it's not. i'm actually really excited. and there were some stressful moments last week for sure, but it went well also...my classroom is as done as it can be for a first-time teacher and i feel prepared (thanks, in large part, to brian's help). i feel proud of that, at least. 

got a lot done today, too...felt productive. need to go in early tomorrow to prep my seating chart...a 6AM call-time means waking up around 4:45, which means that i'll be going to beddy-bye real soon. so, i'm headed home to shower and wash my hair to save myself some time in the morning."

"event","Have you ever tried to use a soldering iron? Not only is it confusing, but the material gets so hot that you burn your fingers even if you touch only the end opposite the end you touched with the iron. Ow. 

I also had a hysterically funny experience today. I was avoiding reading and cleaning my house by shopping in Five Points and went into EarthGifts, a store I saw a few days ago and was sort of intrigued by (it's of the incense, spirituality books, meditation crystals variety). There was this guy in there, Ethan, who was talking to a couple when I walked in. I hear him say something about Fly's Tie, an Irish pub on the beach. In response to the couple's questions about it, he was like ""Oh, I can't go in there. I'd get my ass kicked. Those guys would be like 'I smell a fag' and I'd have to leave. But the Metro...I do the ass kicking in there."" It totally cracked me up. So I find a few new-agey things I wanted to buy and go up to the counter. He looks at my ID and is like ""Roy? That's my real name."" (HA!) Then he looks again and is like ""And my mom's name is Beth!"" I'm laughing pretty hard by now because he's just such a doll and we proceed to discuss how Iggy Pop is hot, but only below the neck. (Ethan would SO hit that). Since he transferred the horrible mental image of Iggy into my brain, he decided to make his atonement by bringing over a poster of a beefy Italian wrestler whose head he WOULDN'T have to cover with a bag. So then he asks me ""What's your sign?"" ""Capricorn,"" I say. To which he replies, ""I'm a Leo with Capricorn rising!!!!"" I tell him that I don't know my rising or moon signs, but he decides that this doesn't matter and asks me where I was born. I tell him Fort Hood, TX. ""I'm from Dallas!"" Then we start talking about houses and I'm mentioning how my landlord and his boyfriend restore places in San Marco and at the beach, to which he exclaims ""And you like gay people!"" (And high fives me for the second time.) By this point I'm even more delighted (and still laughing of course) and say ""I guess the universe is trying to tell us something!"" He apparently agrees because he writes down his number for me. 

Maybe I'll get to see him kick some straight-boy ass at the Metro? 

Either way, I just love meeting pleasant people. And I love even more when those pleasant people make a new, different, unique addition to my repertoire of acquaintances. What an amusing little trip that was.

Thinking of going to Spinning class tonight...hopefully this won't be like the last 6 times I thought about it and I'll actually go. Maybe out to the Freebird with Ash tonight, too...although somehow I'm just not sure. Maybe it's the fact that the concert starts at 10, which means 10:30 at the earliest, and I've gotta get my lazy ass out of bed at 6:30 tomorrow morning. Sleep is a girl's best friend. But then again, concerts run a close second. 

Hopefully the last two days of this week will go by a little faster than the rest of it has been...the days have been full of stuff to do and I've felt productive, but they've been dragging a little. Tuesday felt like Thursday, but I have a feeling it was just wishful thinking...funny how that happens when you're missing someone. :)"

"event","So I just got back from a trip to visit the 'rents in Winter Haven. All in all, it was a fairly positive experience and I must admit that I'm a wee bit surprised. The drive wasn't that bad (although it did take me 4 hours  - instead of the normal 2 1/2 or so - in ridiculous rain and rush hour traffic), home was just as I remembered it (and I haven't been there since last Thanksgiving...I thought it was Christmas, but my mom made sure to correct me), and my parents seemed to be in good spirits. I enjoyed their company and our conversations, even if we do SERIOUSLY differ in our political opinions. (To clarify, while watching the Democratic National Convention last night my Dad decided to let me know that he was voting for the hideous dumbass of a Republican candidate who shall remain nameless, despite my threats to live in a cabin in the mountains and mail bomb threats to him if he did.) Visits home always leave me confused in some fashion or another, though...this time, I feel guilty for being so reticent to see my parents because it was very clear to me that they actually do miss me and have been feeling a little unloved and rejected. When things are generally smooth sailing, I tend to forget why I shy away from extended visits in the first place (Oh! That's right! I want my OWN life!). I don't want to run ""hot and cold"" with them, though...I just want to find a middle ground. I do think they are - or, rather, can be - fun people and want them to be a part of my life...just not my WHOLE life, I guess. Anyway, long story short: it was actually okay! 

I came back tonight because hermiasdream and I were supposed to go see this kick-ass rock n' roll/country band called Will Hoge. I saw him for the first time with my parents, actually, and have seen him 3 times since...he puts on one of the greatest shows I've ever had the pleasure of paying money to see. Anyway, so about a week ago I was checking his tour dates on the website and saw ""Jacksonville, FL"" on there. I called up Ash right away and we did a little yippee dance. But then we found that it wasn't listed on the Freebird Cafe schedule (where he's supposed to be playing) and all of a sudden his website was  down for ""remodeling."" So...um...what the hell? Well, the site is finally back up and I checked again today, but now the date is the 29th (ie. tomorrow) and it's still not on the Freebird site. Plus, I'm technically supposed to be volunteering at Freshmen orientation at my high school from 6-9. What's the priority here? Hmmm...rock n' roll ALWAYS comes first! :) (Right, Ash?)

Anyway, I also need to spend some time getting ready for Pre-Planning week next week. I went to the School Depot to pick up some random (but free) supplies on Tuesday with Smarter_hearts (check out her journal for more details!) and want to at least start PLANNING some of my bulletin boards, but I've also got some reading to do. All in all, I'm getting pretty excited...still very conflicted about how to approach ""classroom management,"" though. We had a lengthy discussion about classroom philosophy during the Mon/Tues seminars and I'm starting to question my prior resolution of buying into the ""Don't Smile 'Til Christmas"" bullshit. I don't think it suits me, and the ""I've been teaching for 25 years and you'll figure out soon enough that I'm right"" card doesn't really hold weight with me. To treat anyone with idealism and hope for the success of the children as someone who's just too stupid or inexperienced to be jaded yet isn't really an M.O. that I'm interested in catering to. I'm thinking that...hmm...I'll treat THEM the way I would have wanted to be treated. Go figure. I won't be too hard on them or on myself when things inevitably go awry, but I'm also not going to lower my expectations (which I believe is effectively condemning them to failure anyway) just because the ""Lounge Lizard"" teachers (as someone called them at the seminar) think that all high school kids are the spawn of the devil. And now I'll jump off the soapbox for today. And go take a nap. Or order some pizza. :)"

"event","So today I have my first day of Secondary School Orientation for Duval County at the Schultz Center. Smarter_hearts and I arrived on time this morning (around 8:30) to find that we had to check in not once, but twice (the second time we waited in line for about 10 minutes just to write our names on a ""Hi, My Name Is..."" with a magic marker). Most of the material that they've been going over so far is interesting and informative (two words that are not, as I discussed last night with Melissa, always synonymous). Equally as interesting are the people, both attendees and presenters. Much like the college classroom, where older people auditing the courses simply for their health are the ones who are inevitably overzealous, the older (in age) new teachers and the older (again, in age) presenters are the ones from whom bad cliches and sugar-sweet encouragement drips like molasses. I appreciate that far more than I appreciate the jaded warnings and overdone cynicism of some of the teachers I've met so far, though. Anyway, so we were discussing enthralling topics such as Sunshine State Standards, Sourcebooks, and Reading Logs until around 11:15, when our coordinator let us go and told us to come back at 1:00. That's right, I said 1:00. When you have an 8:30-3:30 day, why the f would you need a 2 hour lunch break? I'd sure as shit rather leave early, woman!!! :) 

That's cool, though...Smarter_hearts and I went to the new Tropical Smoothie in San Marco. Interesting venue. There's a huge parking lot in back with about four spaces and the building still has the residual glass garage-style doors on the front from the garden place that was formerly there. We also saw friend of Amanda's who works in the place across the street from TS that always has the funny sayings in the window (example: ""You could find a pony in a pile of shit."" - Someone's Dad) and it turns out that my suspicions were correct...it is, of course, a web design place. 

Anyway, more to say, but it's about time to make like a baby (you know, and ""head out."" hahahahaha).

1. i got a new computer. it's great. i can actually, you know, USE IT now. 

2. as a result of the new computer and the necessity of a workspace, i moved my living room around. three times. but i'm happy with it now.

3. i dropped my last class for the summer, deciding that the education program at unf is not my cup of tea (to say the least). current other options being evaluated: distance learning in education at fsu, distance learning in latin at uf, $700 online class for certification in place of university classes...??

4. went to see ""i, robot"" last night. very, very pleasantly surprised. expected ""a.i."" all over again - that is, torture with a $7.00 pricetag - but i was wrong. subject matter was entertaining (even thought-provoking), visual effects were pretty rockin', themes were symbolic. and, also despite previous doubts, will smith was pretty f-ing good in it. 

i think that's about all i've got for now. after all, it's 7:58 in the morning. what did i expect? off to download some music on my fancy new machine."

"event","Better day today already. 

Tear-inducing things, namely school issues, are well on their way to being resolved and with any luck it will all be figured out (including $$ stuff) by early next week. Cheers to that!

Spent the morning going through my closet and weeding out some clothes - it's amazing how much of that stuff I don't wear. I think I'm going to take most of it to consignment, which should be interesting - I've never done that before. 

Have my new class tonight. The class is already on Chapter 4 or 5, so I have tons of catching up to do and no book because none of the bookstores have it in stock. And when I finally do find it, it's going to cost me about $90! Yikes! Anyway, so I have to spend some of the afternoon reviewing notes and getting ready for that class tonight. Also on the agenda: gym, visit Ash at Marnie's house, shower, go to San Marco Styles, clean up the house, laundry...(not in that order). 

Thought for the day: The villain is the hero of his own story."

"event","Day has drastically improved, in line with my attitude. It's amazing where a little forced optimism will get you. I can't say it enough: Fake it 'til you make it.

Encouraging (?) horoscope for the day:

Sometimes you want to tilt your house to the side to get all the rubbish out of the way. Right now, you may be feeling the same way about your brain. Before you take drastic measures, poke around in there and save the most valuable things.

"event","so, i feel like a pathetic, teary ball of sadness right now. and i can't say that i've ever talked about this to anybody specifically so i can't be sure if it happens to everyone, but emotional pain definitely (and almost immediately) engenders a physical reaction in me - yes, i get stressed and the muscle up the left side of the back of my neck acts like it's trying to split open my skull, but i also get really sick to my stomach and literally - i always used to wonder why people said this, but now i know - my heart HURTS. all i want to do is crawl in a hole and not come out. my energy is sapped, i'm getting (or have already gotten) a cold/sinus problem, and i've been feeling for the last few days as if i'm going to burst into tears if someone even looks at me the wrong way. is it hormones? is it life? it seems like every little thing contributes to the problem - almost nothing has assuaged my inexplicable (or is it?) grief about EVERYTHING - self fulfillling prophecy? lia told me a long time ago (but it seems like yesterday), at the point when she knew me probably better than anyone else in the world, that i would NEVER be happy, that i was destined to live my life in a permanent state of dissastisfaction and longing. is that true? 

i really hesitate to even be more specific about the things that are bothering me, because it seems that at the exact times when there are the most things to say, i feel like it's not worth it. it's just too much. but when did i become so lazy, so sad, so DEAD? 

i remember not so long ago making two entries in a row here...one much like this one where i spent a great deal of time explaining my precarious emotional state and bemoaning the entire situation and one bitching myself out for being such a wuss. i think i'll just roll those two into one this time, if it's okay with everyone else. GET THE FUCK UP. PUT SOME CLOTHES AND MAKEUP ON. GO OUT INTO THE WORLD. TAKE CARE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ON YOUR LIST FOR WEEKS. STOP CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR OWN STRESS. FIND THINGS THAT MAKE **YOU** HAPPY. STOP WAITING ON EVERYONE ELSE. TODAY, FOR GOD'S SAKE, DO SOMETHING.

As I heard recently, pathetic is not attractive. :)"

"event","what a weird freaking day.

woke up WAY too early, couldn't go back to sleep, felt all fidgety like i was going to crawl out of my skin.

finally fell back asleep hours later...horrible dreams that left me feeling unsettled when i woke up.

tired at the gym...wore myself out in about 20 minutes but stayed for another hour, which should make tomorrow really fun.

getting ready for my new class (secondary school curriculums) but feeling weirded out still, tired still, anxious still. 

looking forward to tonight, when hopefully all of this strangeness will cease. is it a full moon yet? maybe it's the werewolf in me coming out. ha!"

"event","Someone said to me today: ""We're all a little bit crazy. It's the people who don't think they are who REALLY are...those are the ones you have to worry about."" The statement was meant to comfort and reassure me (and it did), but the more I thought about it, the funnier it got...mostly because of the accuracy of it. All of the people I know who are the most...ummm, dangerous...are the people who never doubt their own sanity, their own ""rightness."" Ironic, isn't it? (Feel free to insert Alanis lyrics here.)

Not much to report, which actually reinforces my theory that I'm more boring when I'm content. And if that's the case, bring it on (the boring-ness, that is). I dropped my Summer B night class and added another one that is earlier in the day in hopes that it will increase the likelihood of me actually, say...ATTENDING class. HA! I also withdrew from my Summer C class. I promised myself that when I went back for graduate school, I wouldn't be attending out of obligation but out of desire to increase my knowledge base and improve my life. I don't expect to enjoy every last class I take, but I also don't want to waste my time avoiding them like the plague. The last straw was when I shot off a quick email to my professor asking him about an assignment and he responded (and I quote): ""Sorry, I don't respond to questions that aren't written in Standard English...that includes the use of capitalization."" I felt like writing back and asking him if he really thought that ""standard"" should be capitalized. Whatever, though. Several people had already said that he was a bit of a jackass, and that just served to make my mind up for good. So I paid for a class that I won't be finishing, but my lack of misery is priceless. Right? :)

I also have to go by to pick up my new laptop from school so that I can get familiar with all of the gradebook software and get started on building our 9th grade website for First Coast. I'm excited...definitely thrilled about this new step. And about having something to do with myself. And about changing lives. 

Before that, though, I need to pick up my ""new hire"" paperwork from the county and pay $120 (!!) to get my fingerprints done. Riddle me that, Batman. I'll put my fingers in some paint on a piece of notebook paper and mail it in. Do you think that would work? Anyway, I can't go to orientation until I pay that stuff, and I can't pay that stuff until my flake of a hairdresser pays me the $150 she's owed me for MONTHS now for renting my apartment (which her psycho boyfriend trashed). I FINALLY got ahold of her this morning, at which point she told me that she won't be able to pay me for at least another week...I think she's too strung out on coke or too busy having sex with her strange boyfriend in California (where she's been for more than a week, according to her). I should have just told her to send me some of her whore-cash in an envelope in the mail. I'm just kidding, of course...sort of. No, really...kidding. 

Worked out today, too...felt good. It had been a week or so. Just cardio...weights are tomorrow...have a feeling I'm going to be tired. I'm already feeling a little worn out, but that could be because I didn't really have much to eat (some hummus and banana pudding...no, not together) until 5. That'll do it. In any case, though, I need to shower and dry my hair, but then I need to rest up for the MIDNIGHT SHOW of Spider-Man. I can't wait...It's almost Spidey-time, kids!

Whoopee!

Cheers to you."

"event","relaxing weekend. 

saw fahrenheit 9/11 friday...if you haven't seen it, go. i can't say enough about how pleased i am that there is a movie in theatres that, despite the fact that it is propaganda in the same sense as other political campaign material and most certainly has an agenda, can inspire attendees to clap and cheer, to laugh and cry, and (as mr. moore would say) DO SOMETHING. that sort of thing is rare and priceless. it inspired me to seek knowledge and act on it. wish i could express more eloquently how i feel about it, but i'm sure you'll forgive me.

also read some really interesting material online about education that made me think even more about the upcoming school year and what kind of teacher i want to be. the one i want to be and the one i will be will most certainly be at least mildly divergent, but i'd like to close that gap as much as possible.

the theme of this weekend, looking back, seems to have been ""food for thought."" and i live for that shit. 

this week - at least the beginning of it - promises to be busy. errands at school, two papers to write and a presentation to make on one of them, harrassing financial aid yet again, etc. should be fun...i feel rested and prepared, though, to make it through the minefield."

"event","Although I'm not quite sure that my take on it is the acceptable meaning of ""fight or flight,"" I feel like the choice between those two things has characterized my life for the past few months and has really come to a head in the last few days. What's worth fighting for? When is it time to let it go and leave? Is it better to roll with the punches, accept things as they are, learn to adapt, and not battle with the unavoidable - or to fight tooth and nail for what you believe in and what matters to you? What if it doesn't matter to everyone else? Do I care? And wouldn't it be better, sometimes, to start with a clean slate - keep everything you've learned from your experiences thus far and go someplace new where you can apply them with new people and reinvent your existence? Is that even possible? When are relationships damaged beyond repair? And if you think they are, are those the situations where you stay and fight or where you run like hell? I guess it comes down to something I said in an earlier entry...I won't live like that. I won't give up. But sometimes it sure feels like the best thing to do.

In order to manifest the ""flight"" side of the equation that I too often ignore when I'm ""fighting"" against other things, I've felt the urge to get in the car and drive lately - windows down, going as far as possible. So that's what I did tonight. And I felt free...conflicted, but stil free. And, strangely enough, happy. In spite of everything...happy. It might, along with long walks, have to become a more frequent habit. Just the silence and me, figuring out what to fight for and why."

"event","I was just talking with a friend and, in the course of our conversation about some things going on with other friends, I was presented with a difficult question: When are the times when your ""advice"" is most effective or helpful? I was forced to analyze, not only with this friend but with everyone, how much I may or may not affect people's lives (specifically their behaviors) with what I say.

First of all, I decided in my mind to define ""helpful"" or ""effective"" as meaning that their conversation with me had caused a visible change in behavior, reaction, emotion, opinion, etc. If a person comes to me looking for advice (which, I know, is not always the case...I try to be careful about playing Ms. ""Fix-It"" all the time), my goal is to give them things to think about that change their perspective (and thereby their behavior) in the given situation. For as long as I remember, I've been the advice-dispenser in most of my relationships: people tend to come to me to talk about things. Here's the disturbing part, though: there isn't a situation in recent memory where my advice has given way to a visible alteration in anyone's life. For all of my worrying about being a good friend, an impartial guide, a ""devil's advocate,"" a level-headed individual, a willing ear, a sympathetic but not codependent companion, etc., haven't I managed to offer anyone anything useful?!?!

Why is that? Do I talk too much? Do I not say anything important? I feel like my life has been changed in many very significant ways by the input of my friends. I feel like I listen and take that to heart, altering my own life and my own reality according to advice that I actually believe to be ""truth."" And if I do that but no one else does, which of us is right? I believe, certainly, that there is no ""absolute"" right or wrong, truth or falsehood, but I am always searching for the best way to live my life, not only for my sake but for the sake of those around me. What if I'm doing it all wrong? What if it would be better for me to be emotionally closed off, convinced of my own wisdom and setting my own conclusions without any regard for outside input? Is it better to be ""strong""? To be right all of the time? Would I know myself better if I stopped listening so much to other people? Would I be a better friend if I stopped trying so hard to give other people input and just listened to what they had to say, never offering any reaction (since it seems to be pointless anyway)? If I'm not an effective, helpful, useful friend, who am I? If I'm not smart and insightful and wise, if I'm no longer the ""sage,"" who am I? 

As I'm writing this, though, I'm realizing how ridiculous this all is. Is this really how I define myself? Is this why someone needing me is equivalent to them loving me? Likewise, if they don't need me, do they still love me? No wonder I'm so confused all of the time. I recently accused a friend of mine of having no ""layers"": she takes things personally and everything hits her right at the core, which isn't good. But what if I don't have any layers, or any core, at all? If my top layer is Play-Doh that can be manipulated so easily by the outside world, I'm always left wondering if the way people sculpted me is the way I really am. 

I'm deciding right now, though, that it just isn't true. I may have forgotten, but I do know, somewhere deep down, about the stuff I'm made of. So this is my protest. Some things people have said about me lately have really hit home because I wonder if they're true and while I'm learning (a la ""Dark Side of the Light Chasers"") to accept the things that were previously unacceptable about my character and that I have a little of everything in me, I know that these things are not true:

I AM NOT A WEAK INDIVIDUAL. 
I AM NOT UNTRUSTWORTHY.
I AM NOT A ""FOLLOWER."" 

As I move forward and confront those issues, I'll keep in mind that it doesn't matter what people say because I know my own truth. My truth is that I'll keep trying to help people and keep being open to help myself, because that's what life is about. It's about feeling, about changing, about experimenting, about growing. I don't want to stop doing that."

"event","So I just found out that I have to pay $120 for fingerprinting and orientation before I can start working as a teacher. Plus, the orientation is four hours long and I also must attend a two-day ""new teacher"" seminar. What the hell?! I'm not even sure I can make my RENT this month, much less shell out that much dough for a job I'm not even getting a paycheck from for...um...three months! Let's hope that loan comes through in a jiffy. That, or that I get a temp job in the next five minutes.

I'm hoping that the motivation bug bites me again this weekend. I'm home alone for the second weekend in a row and I'd like to do some yoga or go to the gym, get some painting done, see a movie, have some friends over, go out to the beach, etc. I also have to get my paper/presentation done for my Monday class, which should be both distracting and gratifying if done correctly.

Hopefully I'll be able to make an entry tomorrow about the fun time I had tonight (doing what? I don't know), the yummy drinks I had, the cute boy I met, the good music I heard, the great friends I talked to...any of the above would do. Then again, renting a movie and laying on the couch sounds great, too. :) I'm easy to please...well, most of the time. But that's a whole other topic. Ha! :)"

"event","You know, as I was sitting here waiting for the page to load so I could make another entry into this journal, I realized that just about the only thing I come here to do is complain. And that - as if there weren't already enough things - is one of the things that bothers me more about my personality than any other. I feel that the more comfortable I am with somebody, the more I tend to use them as a sounding board for my bitchin'. When I'm first getting to know somebody, I make sure that I'm ""on"" all the time - I've come to refer to this persona as ""fun Melissa."" Fun Melissa is the girl I want to be all the time, but the one I can only muster up the energy to be for a very limited duration. Fun Melissa gets me into trouble, but Fun Melissa is also magnetic (or at least I hope so) - I've molded her into the kind of girl that I've always admired: a little loud, a little brash, a little over-the-top, a little crazy, laughs a lot, talks a lot, loves a lot, drinks a lot. A bit more of a ""free spirit"" than Everyday Melissa, if you will. I imagine her with a spotlight on her all the time, wearing midriff-baring tops and linen skirts (always with bare feet), laughing hysterically at everything, loving life and inspiring others to do so as well. Fun Melissa is like a spider, though: she tends break out the venom once she's spun the web. That's depressing. I want to be free and inspiring and magnetic and joyful all of the time. I want to LIVE.

I feel like I should just kind of end the entry right there (that's enough embarrassing soul-baring for one night), but I might as well not break old habits, right? Might as well finish with the bitching...

Here's the gist of tonight's story: People suck. Namely my stepsisters and their horrid bitch of a mother. She's decided that she doesn't have nearly enough income, what with being laid off recently from her SIX FIGURE job with a nice little severance ""package"" and her new husband's income, to support her daily microdermabrasions, nail touch-ups, and massages, nor does she have the means to continue buying my adolescent sisters and endless supply of brand-name clothing, accessories (LUIS VUITTON FOR A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD), gadgets, etc. So she'd like to take my dad back to court for more child support, regardless of the fact that he's voluntarily increased it three times in the last two years. His response? If she decides to do that, they're going to revisit the mandatory visitation issue (he doesn't see them nearly as much as he has the right to and always does all of the driving to pick them up and drop them off). She freaked out about that, of course, and in fact it's more punishment than its probably worse considering that the girls themselves are miniature, but no less formidable, bitches and make my parents' life a living hell when they visit. So, three days before Father's Day, the oldest girl calls to tell my dad that she hates visiting him and that if he makes her come she'll just be difficult the whole time. He then responds by telling her not to be a ""snot-nosed brat,"" at which time her mother (obviously listening in) gets back on the phone and tells him not to talk to her like that. And the result? My parents are having both girls for two weeks starting on Saturday. Oh joy. In my infinite stupidity, I also offered to have them visit me for a few days to alleviate the burden on my parents, but the problem is that I have NO relationship with them. I'd do that to help my parents out, but I can't say I'm secretly hoping that they'll decline the offer.

Besides that, I'm still worried about school (lots of work to do this weekend), a job (applied at temp agencies today...hopefully I'll hear something soon), and the separate situations going on with a few friends. I feel so out-of-touch with people lately. One person - one very important person - in particular. I feel very unsettled, like I don't have any idea what's going on with this person and they won't really talk to me about it. I just feel so much distance from everyone lately. What to do, what to do? I so often try to force the issue with people, ""making"" them talk to me about things and trying to fix every situation to be the way I want it, but this one is one of the only ones I can't do that with.  Guess I have to just leave it, hoping that things will be back to normal soon, but I don't really see the light at the end of the tunnel. Cryptic enough for everyone? 

It'd be nice if you could make people feel what you want, huh?"

"event","so i really intended for this entry to be a small update on my studying status, but i've gotta tell you: i had the weirdest dream EVER last night. 

i was pregnant and just about ready to deliver. but i hadn't really gained any weight and didn't have a pregnant body. and no one was really talking about it. but my due date came along and, despite the fact that i wasn't in labor, i piled into a bus with kim and ryan and all of these other people from high school (steve & stash, mike, rob...mostly boys, strangely enough) so that they could take me to the hospital. we stopped along the way at a church so that everyone could get out and all of the boys could line up on a grassy hill and take a picture. all of a sudden kim's mom was there, too, and they all kept talking about how happy they were that kim and ryan had gotten married at that church (but it wasn't the one they actually got married at). then we got back into the bus - which kim's mom was now driving - and kim and ryan and her mom proceeded to whisper the rest of the way about how glad they were that it wasn't kim who'd gotten knocked up. so, after HOURS of driving through a city i don't know but is pretty much like any town in rural georgia, we come to the hospital. we had to drive that far because the closer one was too ""ghetto,"" but in this one they won't even check me in. in the meantime, i'm hysterically crying because no one - none of my friends besides kim - would come with me. when i call kathleen, she's in a hotel room with some random guy and says that it's ""really not that important"" and my parents won't come because they can't ""get a flight"" until a month later. everyone just keeps saying how they're glad it didn't happen to them. i'm also crying because i don't know the sex of the baby and can't pick out a name, but i decide that i think it's a girl and i'll name her ""august."" anyway, all 56 of us sit in the lobby for awhile until everyone decides that i'm not having the baby and we leave. i don't remember how we got back, but all of a sudden i'm in a brand new building on the UNF campus that is curved like a horseshoe and all windows along the front. brian and i are having dinner upstairs in a 50's diner (the rest of the building is a huge auditorium). i have one contraction (i think) and he gets up to call the ambulance because he misunderstands that i've said ""yes"" to his question about that instead of ""yes"" to ""are you okay?,"" which is what i thought he said. he goes up a flight of stairs to a short balcony above where we're sitting and finds a person dead. i ask what's wrong and he says something about that being a ""familiar sight,"" which references me as if he's found me like that before. it's a man who's committed suicide, but he's laying on a large pile of blueberries, which i for some reason assume are good for soaking up blood. brian and i both get on the phone to call the police and by the time we walk back up there, the area is blocked off and everyone is telling us to leave. after that, i can't really remember...maybe i woke up...

i'm still really weirded out, though. you know how when you're scared or angry or hurt in a dream that's really vivid, you are left with some of that residual emotion? i feel like i've been crying for days and don't really want to see any of my friends because i'm just the ""black sheep."" funny.

so, back to the small update that started this thing: i'm getting ready to study for my essay exam tonight and hopefully all goes well. i have two very opposing thoughts about it: on one hand, i'm overconfident; on the other, i realize that i've skipped a bunch of classes and read very little and probably need to kick ass to get a ""b"" in the class and i just might be screwed. let's hope the latter isn't the case when i sit down to take the test."

"event","no, not as in the movie (although that was a topic of conversation tonight amongst friends)...i'm actually referring literally to the day after tomorrow in the picture show that is my life.

the day before yesterday, yesterday, and today were quite productive. i got about 2/3 of the things on my ""honey do"" list done and am feeling good about that. ""content"" or ""settled"" would be the best adjectives to describe my feelings about accomplishing those things.

let's hope, though, that this productivity streak continues. the day after tomorrow is my final exam in one class. tomorrow, though, i need to finish 8 1-page summaries for my 6 pm class (which i'll no doubt be brainstorming ways to get out of from 4:45 on). fin aid is also calling my name, and they'd better start shelling out the dough on that loan that i've now been waiting more than TWO MONTHS for!!! ugh!

tonight was comprised largely of great conversation with friends. it really is the best form of entertainment - all for the mere cost of a six-pack! :) i also watched ""bowling for columbine"" for the first time. WOW. i haven't fully processed all of my disappointment and rage regarding some of the content, but i do know that it inspires me once again to become more informed about civic and political issues. i wish i'd started sooner, but there's no time like the present.

one more thing to contemplate: in education, we often talk about ""outcome"" or ""standards"" based curriculums (ie. here in Duval county, the content and structure of the curriculum bend - and break - according to the demands of FCAT testing, which is the be all and end all of success evaluations). extending that to a larger scheme, i don't want to life an ""outcome-based"" life. in the past, i've spoken or acted out as a rule only when i have a vested interest in a specific outcome - when i wanted something and thought i could get it. however, there are some things weighing on me lately that i feel might need to be voiced but will almost assuredly not change the situations in question in any favorable way for me. should i still say/do these things? if i don't, what will be the mental/emotional consequences for me? if i do, what will change? 

well, i'm feeling more than a little sleepy and am off to rest in my freshly-laundered sheets and let my unconscious mind do what it will."

i was taking a little mental health vacation (yes, i'll just ignore the fact that this virtually jobless summer has been one whole mental vacation) and watching an episode of ally mcbeal on dvd. it was one of the early first-season episodes where she and roommate renee are taking a figure sculpting class. ally starts dating the model, who is very...ahem...well-endowed. they're on their date at a bar and she's questioning him about whether it bothers him to ""sit around naked like that."" he replied, ""i'm only 27. it's a little early in life to be really bothered. we're single with money, healthy - plenty ahead for us to be really bothered about. right now, we're in toyland."" for some reason, that hit me like a ton of bricks. (i know, i know...the power of mindless fantasy television.) 

i have been doing a lot of thinking over the last few weeks...or months...okay, 23 years...about why everything is so difficult. specifically, i was thinking last night about how 90% of my time and energy is expended on interpersonal relationship crap...worry, guilt, obligation, pleasing everyone else...and about how there's just about nothing in life that i don't WORRY about with every ounce of my being. and i'm so fucking TIRED that i can't even explain it. so while watching this episode, i'm trying to count the things that i really, really have to be worried about, and they're very few. yes, my finances are in a bit of a state, but i know where my next meal is coming from and that i'll have a roof over my head when i come home. yes, i'm worried about my career, but i've had the luxury of good schooling and still have more options than i'd like to admit. yes, i worry about my relationships with my friends and whether they'll ever be bullshit-free, but i do have friends that i can count on despite all of the ""drama."" yes, i get exasperated with family issues, but i know that the frustration comes from a place of love and a desire for things to be different. and of course i worry about my romantic life and all of the agonizing i've been doing about that lately, but i also know that i've been loved and given love in the past and that it will happen again even if it's not working out how i'd like it to right at this moment.

point being, as i said in my entry before, i just want to stop wasting my time worrying. in that spirit, i'm looking forward to a productive and healthy weekend where i accomplish things that are weighing on me. 
on the list:
-finish ""a clockwork orange"" for the book club
-do some exercises in ""dark side of the light chasers""
-read my textbooks and study for my tuesday exam
-finish the 15 pages of notes/assignments for my monday class
-mail my thank-you notes from various long-past events
-finish the black and white painting i started last week
-mail in my cell phone rebate (hopefully still valid)
-make it to the gym...or at least downstairs for a meeting with my yoga mat
-put in some applications for part time work to get out of the house until school starts in the fall

i'm very pleased to report that yesterday i accepted a position as a 9th grade language arts instructor at first coast high school here in jacksonville. i'll be starting in the fall and, while i'm certainly a little nervous (skeptical, doubtful, nervous...are we sensing a theme here!?), i'm also very excited about this new road. the administrative staff, by all accounts, is very supportive of the professional and personal development of their faculty (which is a plus) and the lead teacher for the 9th grade english ""team"" seems great. she is very involved in curriculum development here in the county and, seeing as that's what i'd like to pursue as a career when i get to be a big girl, she could be a great resource for me. the school is also very involved in moving toward an integrated curriculum, wherein teachers work together to (*surprise, surprise*) integrate material from different subject areas into their classrooms...this was a huge turn-on for me with this school because it's something, among other philosophies, that i believe could really save the state of the public school system. i'll climb down from my soapbox now, though, and just say that i hope this move will be everything that i want it to be. 

on a slightly more annoying note, i STILL haven't gotten the money from my loan for my summer classes. yes, my SUMMER classes. what the hell month is this now? and i can't really get a job because i have a few meetings in june and july for the teaching gig and i obviously couldn't ask for time off with a new job, plus people are understandably reticent to hire someone that will very obviously be leaving right around the time she finally learns the difference between the decaf and regular coffee pots. :)

as for the other things, same ol' same ol: skipping too much class, avoiding too many necessary and responsible things, worrying about stuff that i could just get up off of my ass and take care of in half of the time, daydreaming about living someone else's life, and being my existentially dissatisfied self. 

that, of course, isn't the whole truth though: i've also been having fun spending time with friends, learning too many new things to count in my grad program, looking forward to the ""girlfriend-ness"" and intellectual stimulation of our new book club, enjoying many delicious alcoholic beverages (not TOO many, i swear - ha!), and making a sincere effort to appreciate the little things - joys, sorrows, ironies, simple beauties - in everyday life. 

mood right now: more balanced than usual. :)
mood after re-reading my journal entry: bemused by self. note to that self: write less next time. no one cares THAT much. :)"

I could write a post filled with inside jokes from The Office, but that would make me miss those crazy characters all the more. So I won't do it, even though it will be extremely hard...ANDDD THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. Wow, I am tweny four years old...long sigh...let's continue. Even though the Office has taken a break to refill it's supplies that doesn't mean you can't watch new content. I have compiled the 10 best Dwight Schrute hidden moments for you to take a gander at. These were collected from deleted scenes, bonus material, and the NBC primetime preview special in which The Office hosted. As NBC used to tell us, ""If you haven't seen it, it's new to you"". Here ya go, enjoy. Let me know what you think in the comment section.</a>"

"event","Why Miami Will Win (even though I don't want them to)

1) Superstar coach-Pat Riley
2) Superstar center-Shaq
3) Superstar guard-D. Wade
4) Sub superstars-G. Payton, A. Walker, A. Mourning.

I have been watching the series and I've noticed that Nowitzski is being hammered inside and when he gets the ball. Luckily, he is moving well without the ball.

Shaq has so little game, nowdays, but he gets away with pounding people on offense and defense. Back in LA, it was a mix, where he didn't get a lot of calls, because of his size, yet he hammers Dirk and gets away with it.

Riles has never been a ""great"" coach in my opinion, but an average one with superstar caliber players. He tends to think he is better than he really is.

Wade, in my opinion, is one of the most OVERRATED players in the league. Sure, he can get his (he's that good), but plays minimal defense and gets way too many calls to go his way. In Game 5, he even leveled the ref, stayed on top of him, then got off of him and came from out of bounds to score, even tho the footage shows that his feet were still OUT OF BOUNDS. Yet, it doesn't matter. His ""status"" is like that where if someone even gets close to him as he shoots, refs favor him. The reason for this is the league's ""need"" to replace MJ. Kobe was it, until Colorado, and LBJ will soon be it, but he needs to get deep into the finals. So, for now, the league uses Wade, and through repayment, they give him most calls on offense and defense. Example, at 2:16 remaining, on a drive to his right to the basket, he cleared a defender out with his left arm, no one touched him, and he gets the foul and the basket.

G.P. has so little offense, now, it isn't funny. It's sad to watch younger players run circles around him. Great defense, once, that has boiled down to just watching. J. Terry, et. al, have just eaten him alive off the dribble, but they don't get calls to go their way.

A. Walker never had any defense. EVER. If he had his choice, he'd stand outside the three point line and shoot, even tho he's 6'9"", and listed as a power forward. 

Mourning is a great player in decline, yet, as a sub, he has found a niche to make great plays and have great energy. Still has good defensive skills.

To be honest, I feel bad for Nowitzki. He's a great player. Awesome skills. A Larry Bird type that can do it all, and doesn't turn the ball over that much. Yet, watching him being pushed, shoved, and essentially taken out of his game by the refs is horrible.

It's also sad to see Coach Johnson. Great coach. Great motivator. Has shown what it takes to be a premiere coach. But, he had his best bench player, J. Stackhouse, taken out of this game due to a reasonable defensive call, but the refs, as par for the course, ""over called"" it and decided to suspend him for one game. Ridiculous.

Watching this Finals has really made the NBA a very depressing and silly game.

It's OT. We'll see what happens."

"event","From Boing Boing:

<strong>Mark Frauenfelder</strong>:
Recently, I started making my own sauerkraut, which is much better tasting than store bought. There have been stories suggesting that fermented foods like kimchi and sauerkraut are good for your immune system. (Here's a BBC story about claims that <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4347443.stm"">kimchi may cure bird flu</a>.)

So this article about Kimchi in the LA Times caught my eye. The Chinese <em>World Journal of Gastroenterology</em> recently ran a report titled ""Kimchi and Soybean Pastes Are Risk Factors of Gastric Cancer.""

<blockquote>The researchers, all South Korean, report that kimchi and other spicy and fermented foods could be linked to the most common cancer among Koreans. Rates of gastric cancer among Koreans and Japanese are 10 times higher than in the United States.

<p>""We found that if you were a very, very heavy eater of kimchi, you had a 50% higher risk of getting stomach cancer,"" said Kim Heon of the department of preventive medicine at Chungbuk National University and one of the authors. ""It is not that kimchi is not a healthy food &#8212; it is a healthy food, but in excessive quantities there are risk factors.""</blockquote>

<p>It could be that the danger of kimchi might be from the large amount of salt in it, ""which could combine with red pepper to form a carcinogen.""

<p>In any case, I'm not going to stop making sauerkraut. I don't use much salt when I make it anyway. <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-kimchi21may21,0,3296748,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines"">Link</a>

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution"">DDR</a> will soon become a Saturday morning television series on CBS:

<blockquote>
In ""Dance Revolution"", 'tweens' and teens bring their freshest moves to this sensational new dance competition where teams of dancers display their innovative routines. Hosted by the charismatic ""Dance Revolution"" house band, kid-friendly judges determine the winners as the dancers perform their routines to the cool sounds of the band. ""Dance Revolution"" will also offer onscreen visuals that constantly encourage viewer participation by demonstrating specific dance moves and steps.</blockquote>

2. Discrimination or prejudice based on race.""</a>

nationalism is...<a href=""http://www.answers.com/nationalism"" target=""_blank"">""1. Devotion to the interests or culture of one's nation.
2. The belief that nations will benefit from acting independently rather than collectively, emphasizing national rather than international goals.
3. Aspirations for national independence in a country under foreign domination.""</a>

i am utterly SICK of people saying that being against illegal immigration is ""racist"". the notion of ""race"" is barely a coherent term (since we are so much more genetically alike than different), and, to boot, i don't bloody well care what country they come from, as long as they do what is expected when i travel to their country.

yet, apparently, ignorance is bliss. :)

so, if you disagree, please....PLEASE argue with me. and, promise not to throw out personal remarks and such and stick to the issue.

Hearing conservative talk radio this AM, a lot of ""fellow conservatives"" feel betrayed by Bush. I don't blame them. He's totally blindsided them with the ""amnesty"" program, the Iraq war, his ""war on terrorism"", and the Haliburton fiasco.

Understand, it's a little...weird...to see so many people into this movie.
not that it's a bad movie. i liked it. a lot.

but, last night, there was some like 17 year old dressed up as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_vendetta"" target=""_blank"">V</a>. very good costume. but, it was weird. there were a few of us over 30, but most were young people.

when it originally came out in '88, i think, well, it didn't sell, save for the notion that it was by the same writer as ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen"" target=""_blank"">Watchmen</a>"". Kevin, the comic guy, told me that i might like it, he didn't, but, that i should check it out. 

i did.

i still have all 10 (i think) original issues.
and, a pin from the convention that year, of just a v, with a circle around it.

again, great movie. i liked it. but, i knew the story, and, i think that it might come across to some as being a bit...confusing.

if you get a chance, before or after you see the movie, i'd advise going to your local book store, check out the graphic novel section, and picking up the book. you can read it there. :)"

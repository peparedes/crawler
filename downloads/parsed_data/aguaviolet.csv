"event","Hmmm, It's a darn shame that the semester just started and I'm already catching the senioritis bug. I just don't feel like doing anything... I wanna graduate. Hee,I know if I don't do anything, I won't graduate. LOL This semester seems sooooooo not real. It's like I'm going through the motions of going to class and doing homework. I haven't started my countdown yet, but it's coming. :-)

See ya"

"event","Man, I haven't been here in a while. Well lets see what's going on. PSE id good, we have a lot of new members. Today is Marc's 21st birthday. He's very excited. I am too, just a little though. I just don't want him to drink to much. He's a big boy and can take care of himself, along with my help :-)More to come later"

"event","Ha! Today was a interesting day. I had the first two of my five classes today which were TECH 402 and FLJP 101. The TECH 402 class is called Training and Development and the FLJP class is Beginning Japanese. They both seem interesting. I guess as the semsester rolls on I've have more to say about them."

"event","On Friday, I got the chance to see my cousin's new baby . Awwwwww! He is adorable. His name is Nicolas Lamuel Robert (enter last name). I don't remember his last name but he's a little darling! He's three weeks old today and is soooooo cute. I didn't hold him though because he was so little, but my sister and mom did. I think my auntie was getting on my sister nerves though because she wants my sister to have another child. I really do to, but I think if she has another kid, I'll have kids by then. 

Well, my nephew, sister,and bro-in-law are gon back to MI and I thought I would be done with visitors, boy was I wrong. My mom's cousin came here along with her two sons from MI. We had a cookout with barbecued hot links and chicken, fried green tomatoes, and spagetti. YUM!!! I would've chosen to have ribs too, but we had that like two weeks ago. Oh well.

Three more days until I move in for the final time. I have gotten farther with packing but not really much. Since we keep having company, I can't organize my stuff they way I want to ( which is throwing everything on the floor and picking out the things I want). I have to keep my room clean and it's kinda getting hard to do 'specially when I have to dig for clothes and shoes. 
My boyfriend and one of my friends moved in thier respective apartments. He moved in on friday and she moved in on saturday, but my boyfriend came back to chicago and is not actually gonna stay until wend. They all moved out of the dorms and left me all bymyself. The bad thing about this is that he lives so far away, but the bus still runs over to where he lives. So I guess that's a good thing, but I don't know. Another bad thing is that he was supposed to get a car, but I really don't know if that's happening, so that's another blow. He's been waiting and working all summer long to get a car, but situations cause him not to get one. My girl pal lives in the oppisite direction of my boyfriend and I'm stuck in the middle. The truth is I'm extremely jealous of both of them because that's an experience that I will never have, but my sister said it's better for me to stay in the dorms because I only have one year left and I don't have to deal with roommates since I'll have a single. Maybe, I'll never have to live in an apartment and just go straight to a house if my life's plan works out by moving home after college for 2-3 years to save up a down payment and then by a house. I really rather own than rent anyway, but I bet that's not going happen and I will have to move out. My parents did say that they would help me with an apartment AFTER college, so I guess that's okay. I guess to compensate, I'll just visit them alot and become a stove mooch (someone who uses thier stove more than they do and don't pay a dime  j/K). 
I guess i can get over it. hee"

"event","Packing to go to back to college is a major PAIN!!! I just realized that I have more things to do and more items to pack. The hardest things are my clothes because I have soooooo many. Oh, and I can't forget about shoes too! Then there is the bed stuff, decoration, electronics, supplies, PSE stuff, and all those LITTLE things that if you forget them makes a big difference i.e computer cord. One of the bad things about packing this stuff is the fact that if I pack it up now, I might need something in it the next day and to make it all worse, I have to move myself in with all my heavy things. My mom has to work; my dad can help a little, but not too much. I thought my nephew would help me to move in ( he's been visiting from MI for two weeks) but his mom and dad came to get him. They are going home this saturday and I'm moving next week. No FAIR.

I guess I have some good/positive things to look forward to this school year. I've finally been able to take a Japanese language course which I've been tying to get into freshman year and never did until now. Also, I get to hang out with my Pi Sigma Epsilon peoples. I think that is what I'm most looking forward to. I've never been part of a group that is so tight and everyone gets along for the most part. It's like a family and on top of other things I get to learn so much about Marketing and selling because I don't think I've would learned that in a classroom since my major is Management(Human Resource).

I've been told that I should go into sales since as said by some that I have nack at it. I don't know, but if I'm good at it, then why not? Of course, I still have a LOT to learn about Sales and Marketing (PSE is a Marketing and Sales Fraternity)and I'm not to entirely sure if that is for me. I have to start looking for a job since I'm graduating so I think I won't rule that out. There was a time in which I would'nt even consider sales, but somebody has to do it and it can be fun and informative. 

I think as it gets closer to move-in time, I've becoming a little more excited. I love to learn about everything I can. It's cool to expand your mind. But that's just me. I get all teary-eyed when I finish a good book, or all bubbley when I learn something I've never knew before, or get all worked up when I have to research something. Call me a nerd, I just like that stuff. 

Hee, well Gotta keep packing!"

"event","Wow, two weeks until I go back to school. Normally, I'll be really excited to go back, but this year I'm not really looking forward to because this school year will be my last year of college. I know the whole thing about going to college is to get a nice job to make a living, but I think I'm just going to miss school until I start making money and doing what I want to :-)"

"event","i'm really sad right now, seeing how Mr.shapiro recently past away. He was so awesome. He was by far one of the best people around. He was kind, good hearted, and always there. Gracious is the only way to describe him. I can't believe that he's gone, but in a way he's still here. His legacy will forever live throughout the halls of LHS. And tonight i went to the gathering at his house and it was really nice. I got a chance to meet his wife and she is really nice, but the funny thing is that she was so strong about everything. I didn't see her cry at all and she just focused on all the positive aspects of Mr. Shapiro's life. They were so lucky to have each other, two amazing people.
     She showed me the pictures in the livingroom of the trip to hawaii that they took and up till that point i had managed to keep my tears in side, but when i saw his face and how happy he was i just broke down. He was so happy, he was supposed to come right back after treatment and surgery and stuff but then this happened. How come the best people in life are taken so soon? I think that these people are put here to guide us, but when they are taken away it opens our eyes to the things around us and reveals  the reality that we need knowledge of. 

                         Mr.shapiro...........Rest In Peace
forever you will live on.........in our hearts.......we'll miss you



although you are gone,
your legacy lives on,
never forgotten,
yet taken forgranted.......
but you made us happy,
you made us laugh.
your purpose on earth,
was to guide our paths.......
you taught us by choice,
not by default,
you did a good job,
no matter ho you felt,
you are deeply missed,
your legacy lives on,
you are deeply missed,
now that you're gone...........
but you will never be forgotten...................never"

~
things will end,
things will pass,
but our special thing,
didn't last,
we can both move on,
find love again,
u know it's true,
i know we can,


~
strung out on confusion,
put out on a line,
left and forgoten,
hung out to dry,
can't sleep at night,
can't find my way,
cannot fight,
the almighty wrath,
of mistakes in the past,


~
limping on the edge of destruction,
not knowing how to live,
ruining all that is true to u,
out on the end of a limb,
hanging on every word thats said,
stored in the back of yur mind,
confused and lost,
every single time......................

well there u go.......some more gay poems...........bye"

one by one, 
we take or lead, 
into the darkness,
like mighty steed,
strung out with confusion, 
distrot and lost,
frostbitten bodies,
lost among frost,
quivering alone,
alothough among friends,
you finally pass out,
and never wake again..........................




~hidden valleys,
magestic trees,
high risen greenery,
brushing at yur knees,
lost but not sad,
peacefull and happy,
life in the wilderness,
is not all that crappy..............................




thats all for now.....bye luv most of ya..............."

this is that,
here is there,
nothing matters,
no one cares,
at the hands of the beholder,
we'll all fade away,
in a blaze of glory,
on our last day.............





............................................................
where ever we start,
where ever we end,
we will stay strong,
till the very last strand,
nothing can stop us,
nothing at all,
we'll take our final stand,
walking through heavens halls.............."

praying for forgiveness,
crying and laughing.............

a twinkle in my eye,

a poem for brit j.~
don't ever listen to what he says,
he doesn't know what he's  saying,
he's simply messing with yur head,
his actions will be repaying,
soon you will see,
you don,t need him,
but you have me
                            ...you always have........luv ya"

"event","hey every one............
it's been a while since i last made an entry....well there really isn't that much to talk about.....life still sucks it's all the same..just more problems being trown my way...

..there are very few people i can actually talk to about my life.... brittany is one of the only people in the entire world i csan talk to about my deepest thoughts and such..everytime i tell some one something they either critise me or it ends up getting around to some one else...with brit that never happens.....YOU ROCK BRIT JOHNSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!......you would think that i could tell stuff to people like dana and alissa...seeing that they are supposed to be some of my best and closest friends.....but with them i can only say so much....especially with alissa...she always critisez me about the stuff i do......oh well i geuss there is no way i could be mad at her...she is a pretty awesome person.....so is dana ... he can get quite annoying at times but...i geuss i can put up with him....ha

one thing that really pisses me off is all he people who start spazing at me about the way i write....they think just because i write about death and depression and stuff that it means i am ""suicidal""...they're all fuckin` morons......they can't understand the fact that i'm a ""deep"" writer....and that i'm not writting about my life.......luckily my prents understand thatand they support my writting.....they read all the story 's and poems i write no matter what they're about.........people should be happy that i'm such a good writter....it could really get me some were in life............

and thi whole thing with lindsey and ryan is getting so f`ed up... ryan wrote lindsey all these notes about how if she doesn't go out with him that he's gonna kill himself.....it's all bullshit.... i think ryan was fuckin shoting heroin or sumtin when he wrote those notes......plus he ould never or at least i think that he would never have the balls to comit suicide..... i hate people that go around saying..""oh i'm so suicidal,"" because most of them would never even try it ..... think about c.j. reymond.......he was never going around saying how much his life sucked or anything...... mabee he would still be alive if people would have thought about the outcome before they made fun of him and pushed him around... but no we had no fuckin sense and did it anyway and now he's dead....six feet under....with rope marks around his neck..........i really wish i could go back in time and change everything.....help him out give him some one to lean on.......instead of ignoring him..... but atleast i didn't ride his ass al the time like most people did.....
i'm gonna move on now................


..........gotta go i'm out for now...........get at me"

Actually it sucks........me and kayla broke up last week......and then me and dana wern't friends for a while.......and everything was falling apart........but it's starting to get a little better,.....who ever is reading this probablely doesn't care.......so yeah.....
Kayla was like my whole world....she was so awesome....I liked her so much.....I can't beleive she is gone........moving on .....me and dana are friends again.....i geuss that is pretty cool.......yeah......me and brittany are becoming good friends too........It's pretty cool......now instead of always agravating her, I actually know what she's feeling, so if any one reads this that is always agravating brittany....then back the hell off of her..... people seriously don't know how hard it is for her.........her life is alot harder then most people's.......seriously.....if people keep screwing around with her i'm gonna kick their ass's.........just letting you know.......so yeah..i guess that is it for now.........so yeah....bye.............here's a few poems i wrote recently.....

                                    pushing through
The air is thin,
the light is gone,
with no more life,
we try move on,

we try to push through
 the darkness above,
we try to escape
and fly with the doves,

but nothing works,
no matter how hard we try,
at some point and time,
 we all must die......


			escape and die

We spread our wings,
we run and fly,
we gracefully scan
 the moonlit sky,
we are survivors 
through thick and thin
untill we turn to ashes,
and die with the wind."

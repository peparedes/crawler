I needed to know that she was affected... and reading that would've undoubtedly shown me that she wasn't, which would've killed me. I need attention. I never stopped being a kid, and here I am 20 years of Age. I wonder how long this will last. I still have no Drivers Lic. I don't have my own place. It's one of those situations where you're still in High School and all of your older friends flaunt the fruits of their ""growing"" labor."

"event","My friend Em quit her myspace. I think it's rather interesting. I feel like that's something that everyone's pondering...but the cyber addiction just keeps screwing em in the back door. Everyone secretly wishes to cancel their myspace. Most can't. I think Em may be on to something. If she deleted hers, disappeared from the myspace map, making it known to all that she did... perhaps bri and I should as well. Then we too will disappear. People will soon say ""Crap mang.... everyones leavin'? I gots to get me some-o-dat 'Cancel My Myspace' action!"" Thus, the band wagon for the outro to tons of peoples account cancelations will set sail. 

Sighs... well, in an ideal world, things like this would happen. The world, sadly, is far from ideal. But can't a man Dream? 
Honestly though, on the ""take me seriously"" tip... I like being able to reach everyone despite what they do to hide. NO one can hide on myspace because everyones addicted to it. You're almost certain to find who you're looking for! Creepy. Next thing you know... Myspace'll team up with Ebay and Walmart and they'll end up ruling the planet! Think about it. Walmarts already up to selling cars... Ebay, everything else including life and then some...and Myspace is the biggest phonebook/photojournal known to man. If they got together, they'd probably hop into realestate and start selling homes via (SBM). ---> SpaceBayMart, the world largest and newest 'everything' conglomerate. Hell, on wallstreet and at the stock exchange, they're stocks'll simply be entitled...""Everything"". Cause that's what they'll be capable of; should the ever merge forces. They'll most likely update their company name to ""Gots Owned, Bitches"".

Well, usually when people have something in their eyes, the natural tears flushes it out. In my unfortunate case... what ever is in there really wants to stay. It's been making my eye swell, and tear uncontrollably. I'm not going to walk around looking as if my mother died either, so subsequently I tend to wipe when it does so. My eyes are now RAW from wiping soooo much. So I can't wipe my eyes...and yet I can't get this god forsaken peice of ""whatever"" out of my eye. I think I need to see a doctor. I should go to the emergency room. I don't care anymore, I just want them to remove the pest. I'll do anything. I can't sleep at night because it hurts to blink... so it hurts twice as much to close my eyes and on top of that... look around. REM sleep is hell when you've got dirt in there. >.<

My career, future aspirations, and priorities are shifting violently, and I'm fully comfortable with where ever they may end. This is only because I'm positive it'll be what's best for me, and what, ultimately, I would have desired deepest to do. This, I feel, is good. I think it's about time I started letting my life drive itself. I feel I have a good head on my shoulders. If I'm not to trust my own decisions, how can I expect or demand that any one else does. In the end all it really gives me is peace of mind. If spend too much time worrying about the involuntary consequences of things the occure that are beyond my control, I'll never focus on being truly happy. I've been in much better moods. I've been extremely social and carefree.

But ironically... in the midst of all this newfound peace, I'm probably placing more pressure than ever on myselt to change for the better. To improve and inspire...

"event","It is MONDAY MORNING. I got back to philly around 12 last night. My dorms changed all the locks on the doors...so my keys, that once worked, now don't. 

I think Briana is awesome. I think Briana's family is awesome. I hung out with her grandmother, and she's cool as shit. Her mother packed me a LUNCH for the train. She made two sandwiches, threw in some chips, pie, a soda, and two magazines to read if I got bored. Her mother is ridiculously mom like! I don't know why this surprises me. I guess I'm used to having family members not act their parts. 

I'm going to do a little update...but I hate being long and elaborate. I know I will be...but I'll try not to for what it's worth. I'll just mention random things that are important. 

My break was awesome only because I got to spend so much of it with Briana, Her brother and Neka, and Katie! I had fun with my brother and sisters too. My friends, however, I didn't get to see really. I hung out with Charlie a lot. I SAW a few other people. But I didn't really hang out with them. I didn't really get to skate much either. My brother was allowed to move back in. Things have changed down there drastically. Two of my sisters are black and mild smokers now. They all know I smoke weed. I've smoked w/ my brother on numerous occasions. It was plenty fun driving around trying to find somewhere to smoke. 

My grandmother kicked me out on account of me loosing my temper. She fueled it though. She yelled, screamed, and reprimanded me constantly for no reason and then threw my mothers history in my face, along with many complaints she had about raising us. None the less, I'm too old to hear it. I have no respect for my grandmother. My aunt, the dick rider of my grandmother, TOO, disowned me. They don't want me back there. 

I've no money, I'm jobless, but I'm very happy. I have a wonderful girlfriend who's been with me during every possible winding road I've experienced. I'm glad to have her. And when she comes to philly we're going to do so much together. I'm excited. 
BUT NOW that I am in fact in philly and Don't have class today, I think once I go to sleep and I re awaken, I'm going to first unpack all of my things thoroughly and place them where they belong... THEN I'll head out and job search. When I get back, I'll wash clothes and take me hair out and get myself prepared for tomorrows class. :) I have a busy day ahead. Oh yeah, I'm going to write, text, email, and call Briana as much as I possibly can. I hate being away from her, or knowing that she's not within close proximity. It's a killer. I know she's in good hands at home w/ her mother and Father, but I would still like to be around. Well I'm tired, super sweaty from skating and...well... thristy. I'm going to shower and go to bed. :) I love the way things are working out! 

Oh, and to my surprise, the two roommates that I'm living with are SENIORS... so THIS is their 'last' quarter, meaning that at the end of this quarter... which is only ten weeks... those two move out and I have seniority over the ROOM! >.< I can choose to own which ever room I'd like! :) and I CAN SET THE GROUND RULES FOR THE APT! >.< Right now, I can't smoke in here. So, hopefully a month and a half from now... I'll be doing my thing because those fuckers will have moved out. I dare not think too negatively. I may just move out myself if I can find a decent job that pays enough for me to pay rent by living with two or three others. I'm sure I could recruit SOMEONE to live with me. People HATE 1346. lol No one really wants to be here. lol If I do look into it though. It'll probably be right next door to Briana. haha How cute/perfect would that be? 

I don't put it too far out of the range of possible. After all, lifes getting better for us everyday. :)"

If felt good to just through ideas on the table and have people actually be enthused to carry them out. We had a good time. We skated... I got a little hurt, but it was a really intense day of skating. And we got a lot done. Today, we went to south, came back, and picked up Emily and went all the way up to the art museum again to smoke by the water. It was really peaceful. I had time to think about things. Kyle was also there. Charlies got serious ambition. He wants to do things, go places... live. I wish to do the same. I guess in that respect, it's how we bond. I'm anxious to return home, not because I know of a ton of things to do, but because I'm tired of having things due. I just wish to start over. Another quarter, another battle. And 'of course' I want to see my girl friend. I can only hope that when I return... I don't have to deal with any additional stresses. I just want to come home...and chill. I don't feel like reporting anywhere right away. I don't feel like arguing or not getting along with anyone. I most certainly don't feel like doing any strenuous summer work around the house.

Some guy wanted to take pics of us skating ""Claiming he just wanted to do a project on skaters"". I told him straight up, ""you seem like a cop"" Cops started showing up in the distance. Me and chris bounced. Skated elsewhere for a while. On the way back the same fuckers caught up with us. Five fucking cops cut us off. Chris was quiet. The cops started talking bullshit about how he destroy shit blaha blah fucking blah. They chuckled amongst each other as if we were to scum of the fucking earth! I have no respect for them. Yeah I caught an attitude, I defended my right to say what I felt. I told them it was re-fucking-diculous to have to go so far out of the way to skate. I told them that they didn't love skatings so they'd never understand. They told me they'd lock me up for disorderly conduct. I told them that I had to freedom to say what ever the fuck I wanted to say. And I proceeded to. They could do nothing but listen and threaten to take me in. They didn't though. So they got our info, Gave us our 25 dollar citations. We walked away boardless, and realized they still had our id's. they pulled up and gave em to us. The fucker in the passenger seat decided to have a converstaion with me. 

""Do you know why we took your boards?""

""..... um...yeah... You hate skatebaorders......'

""No, I don't hate skaters, I think you guys should be able to skate her....but I've been living here my whole life and my family lives here, and you come to MY city and run your mouth, I pay taxes blah blah""

""um...fuck your taxes... I pay taxes too. And it's not your city, Do you own this city?""

""Yes it is my city.... And that's why we took your boards because you were running your mouth...."" 

And he proceeds to look to chris and say ""you can thank you friend here for get your boards taken...have a nice day"" and he rolls up the windows a speeds of with a smirk on his face. I could hear the other cop laughing. 

I want to make a pledge right now. 

I hate police officers! I hated them before, but this is the icing on the cake! There is no such thing as a good cop! All cops a power hungry gun waving pigs who don't really give a fuck about the wellbeing of anything! If it were up to me, I'd have all of them publicly executed! I would have them all lined up, shot in every spot that wouldn't kill them, and lit on fire and incinerated until they burned to death! And I'd want their families to be there to witness them die! Fuck Polic!. Fuck law inforcement! Fuck the president, fuck the mayor! Fuck corporate snakes! Fuck authority! Fuck em all!

My consideration goes out the window. My reasoning is augmented to cater only to my senseless desire to vent. It's weird. But sometimes I feels really good. When I'm angry, I have power, and it's somewhat liberating, because I don't care to consider consequences or other peoples feelings. The only thing I care to do is release energy. So many things can get to a person. For me... It would be when people assume things about me. I really don't like feeling like someone knows what I'm going to do under circumstances. If I get upset, I don't want to here ""figures"", or ""I knew you'd do that"", or ""here we go again"". It's condescending...it's ALL very condescending. I'm working very hard to try to change myself...and for others is not the only priority. It's certainly not the first. I don't like the way I am. I know people always tell children ""be happy with who you are"". Well what if that child has the mentality of a Murderer? I doubt he should be happy with his assigned complex. People need to stop thinking that the 'hand you are delt' is the one you HAVE to stick with. There are flaws in character that conflict with morals, ethics, and sometimes the well being of other people. And even if on crazy levels, yours don't happen, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't be allowed to change who you are if you feel you're doing it for the better. You should never poke negatively at the man/woman who's working hard to fix a problem. It's a lot like kicking someone when they're down. If I'm trying to change for the better, it really does no good for people to continuous point out things to suggest my predictability. That only kills my spirit. Eventually I gain my composer, calm down, and try not to loose sight or focus of what my true goals are. But it definatly slows down the process when people don't bare with you long enough for you to make progress. I do it sometimes. My grandmother does it. Hell..we ALL do it. But when you know this very thing that I have come to know, you should cease. I used to do it to my brother. He'd make attempts to change himself for the better, and I spent so much time telling him how fucked up his ways of thinking were sometimes. It never dawned on me that he was trying to changed these things, but lost the motivation to because ignorant people like me wouldn't let him live his mistakes down. After a while I learned to close my mouth and allow the ""turn a new leaf process"" to go through. It's a hard lesson to learn, but I'm happy I know this now. I wish I knew it then.

But honestly, ever since I arrived to 1311 I've been under the impression that I'm 'imposing' on his space. I feel like he's claimed that room, and despite the BOTH of us now living there, he still feels it's more 'his' room than 'our' room because he's lived there longer than I have. This isn't a petty and ill supported hunch. His attitude on various things, and the ways in which he treats my things definately demonstrates that. I would like to say that he monopolizes the room space. For example... I have tons more clothes...and so, he should defer more space to me when all of his things could probably in one space. I have so many clothers that I'm using space from my other roommates room to store some of it. I have ONE dressor. He has the entire closet, and two dessors to himself. o.0 I've even decided to get rid of some of my clothes so that I don't HAVE to find space for them. Another example would be how he never mentions anything to me when he decides to change things around. He's rearranged the room one time, but I really would've desired him speak to me about it first. Maybe I'm whining... Maybe I'm 'blowing things out of porportion'. I'm 'overreacting'. I may be doing a lot of things, I don't know, but right now.. I'm just tired of my roommates and I""m tired of me. :( Turns out, He wanted to use my pants to muffle the fire alarm because they were testing it all day. He claims to have 'not known they were my pants'. I believe him. Either way. I'm a wanna be prude with a short temper. And my girlfriend is having to deal with my attitude everyday. I don't understand it myself. Everything makes me angry. Everything I do, everything she does, everything anyone does is pissing me off. I didn't really start until I met her. I'm not saying she's the cause, but I am saying when she came around, these old feelings started coming back. I don't care to try to convince her that it's not her, she's never going to by that ""it just so happens that you two pop up at the same time"" story. I need help. Seriously. I'm going to have to figure this out. Music helped save me before, and It may be what I need to save me again. \m/ (>.<) \m/ I haven't had a happy face mood since I've been on this fucking live journal! What the hell is wrong with me?"

               I'm not so sure this Christmas will be so different from any of the other Christmas celebrations I've been allowed since my liberation from the Jehovahs witnesses. I'm not too ecstatic about going back home. It's always a hassel going to and fro. The holidays provide both happy and sad experiences for me. I'm happy that it's the one time everyones in the spirit of giving. I'm always in the spirit of giving. I don't ever care to recieve anything. I don't like recieving gifts honestly. However, I, personally, never feel that it's genuine. Sure there are those who truly give from the heart to those who both deserve and do not deserve anything. However, part of the reason would be because of the designated DATE that everyones expected to do this. If I get a gift on Christmas day, it's so easy to assume that he or she felt obligated to do so. They've adopted this ""Oh it's christmas,I HAVE to get him something"" type attitude. I've seen it a million times. To get a gift during some random time of year says that they thought about you because they really genuinely desired to get you something. Christmas is so terribly exploited through the priority of gift exchange. So to get a gift doesn't seem right to me. It's not the true meaning of Christmas. Am I going to sit here and explain to you the true meaning...I'd rather not.. look it up for yourself. It's there. Christmas reminds me of very sad periods of my existence. It's such a Family based holiday. And family, with me, would be the last thing structurally sound. So it's merely a marker for something dysfunctional that I must 'report' back to. But as depressing as I can make this sound, there are some things I look forward to. I enjoy the winter soulstace. I look forward to the beautiful lights, the brisk weather that sponsors the interesting change in peoples clothing. I love the smell of evergreens, and the color themes of Christmas. As for the gift exchange.... well, everyone expects something... Will I give... of course I will. Will I recieve... well, I don't really have a choice now do I. That'd be a smack in the face to the giver. The atmosphere of christmas is a blessing, but the commercial aspect of Christmas is sickening."

"event","Ok, and so it's 1:36 and I have a double today. This is the AM. I'm not tired... slowly and stealthily I'm sneaking back into my former sleep habits. Believe it or not I did get much sleep. I just didn't do my sleeping during the common hours that everyone else slept. I don't get much sleep lately. My back hurts immensely. Despite the marvels of spooning, there is a degree to which I fear even the butteriest of butterflies can't travel. Cuddlings great...but honestly... most beds suck. Correct posture hurts, pad posture hurts, and everything else..... hurts. Check the pattern

   Fabe wakes up--> CRACKS to the left... CRACKS to the right... Hurts. 
My alarm is not the audible one, but rather the blunt twisted vertebrae sensation in my lower back. I honestly desire being stepped on most of the time. The last time some one walked my spine like Cash walked the line, it felt great. I often ask Bri just to 'lay on me'. That does a little. I feel better than I did before pressure was applied. I don't know what it is for SURE, but I have a relative hunch. And this hunch is a lot better than the one I'll have years from now if I don't do something about my back issues. I'm certain its the mattresses. They've got more concave than my skateboard. *I often wonder why I""m not skating my mattress* I'd get a killer sesh out of that curvature. Better the bed than me. And so..the result is at 2 am, I'm up typing about how much sleep hurts when I could be lying in bed with my love. :( But you know this isn't so bad. I can stay up, concentrate, pray, play music, and watch my baby sleep. Watching her get rest is a new pleasure of mine. Her soft breathing, and the occasional smile in her sleep. It's all so very adorable....Save for my BACK.... Damn this, it's bothering me as we speak. The worst feeling ever is when I make an attempt to crack it again to relieve some stress and it's as taught as a stale slim jim. My spine goes nowhere. I'm just stuck. :) But you know, I'm sure it'll get better. 

There's been another issue. Can't flush the details...but I'm sure it's going to make my visit to ""meet the parents"" relatively interesting.  To tell you the truth, I honestly don't care what comes up. I'm ready to deal with it. I'm certain things will be good. Why? Because I'll do whatever it takes to keep what I have. Sure, disappointments will arise, ideas will fly, pouts will simmer. But at the end of the day, Fabian is going to be happy he did what he did. I have no regrets... I have no cares, save for the ones that mean something substantial. But as for everything else consequential, I've not a care in the world. Perhaps this complex is the reason I get into so much crap, and then again this could be the very reason I live a predominantly stress/burden-free life style...though I often have very many obstacles to over come. Worry, to me, is the first step to a short step. And though I fall short commonly, I have no intentions of that fact ever becoming voluntary. 

In other news... my quest for greater humbleness, patience, and understanding is a bit stifled. Bad weather...tight situations and sheer surreptitious misunderstandings have all caught me off guard. Alas, I'll be back at it tomorrow. My Father often told people to be slow to speak and quick to think. I think I'll do that this time."

"event","We all have those moments in our single lives when we walk past a couple and are utterly disgusted with the depth of their involvement with each other... I WAS certainly one of those. But for the first time I feel I thoroughly understand. When you care for/ love someone, you become blind to the outside viewers. Peoples perceptions no longer matter... Priorities that once existed cease. I feel that I've encountered that new Priority. However, I don't care to be too mushy. Once more, here's a perfect example of how love for another makes you disregard the idea of over compromising. I don't care to be mushy because I love her. I don't care about what others think, because I love her. PDA that once disgusted me, that I am now a part of, does not bother me because I love her. It's a convienient compensator, love is. Sometimes she is uncomfortable with me voicing her marvelous qualities. My eyes tell her I see perfection. I know she isn't perfect, but her love for me makes her perfect. Her mutuality makes her perfect. Her trust and fidelity makes her perfect. I often have a hard time trying to seek out the words that would adequately encompass the essence of what makes my baby as wonderful as she is. I've also come to believe that it is that very thing; words' absence thereof. There truly are no correct or incorrect words to conclude a perfect story, or final brush stroke to solidify a masterpiece. All you get is that individual stuck in his or her tracks with eyes and ears of admiration. When I'm still and looking into her eyes *violins play* My search for the words, and my failure to draw any IS my affirmation of appreciation. I love Bri. And for those curious as to whether I've spoke love too soon, my only suggestion is you find love yourself and speak with all honesty, boasting your emotional certainty. I gaurantee, you will find none. Ambiguity is a part of the game. To not be sure if something is or is not the greatest thing to happen to you is what makes it interesting... and in my case, what makes it REAL, but me not being sure is merely a result of my natural inclination to protect my heart. Though one may feel as if a discovery in his/her life is certainly the ONE and worth it, doesn't necessarily mean that person will dive head first into that opportunity. Granted they're not wrong, should they ever accept, it will become the greatest thing to happen to them. Should they be wrong, and are too haste...well then, there you have it. This would be the very reason we hesitate, and are not sure of ourselves when we believe we've found something that is simply ""too good to be true"". I assess, and assert right now, before all anonymous readers and familiar readers... My particular story, my particular love story, one of millions I'm sure, begins with an acceptance of that which I believe is too good to be true. And I tell you now... I am willing to dive head first into that opportunity and accept the risks that may be involved. Not because I'm bored with my life...but because I realize that I love her. 

What better way to show your trust that to risk loosing what it is you must? :)"

Cambridge is an odd little place.  Then I got offered a job back in Birmingham working for a music management company who look after bands, the sort that are on the telly.  So I moved back.  Still don't know what I want to do exactly.  Just having fun for now.  More information to follow. Perhaps."

I've moved most of my stuff, cleansed my cupboards and am heading for Cambridge upon the morrow.

Having said most of my goodbyes I am indeed a little sad to be leaving.  But not that sad."

"event","So here's an update on my glamarous indie rock n roll life.

I fucked up my dissertation, had to sprint through uni half dressed to get it in on time - I actually got a round of applause from a bunch of strangers as I stumbled towards the office. It made me feel special. 

I did the same for the following essay.

I went home for a bit over easter and lamented my failing degree. It was nice to see the old friends and potter round to various old country pubs as I did 'back in the day.'  Stayed in Canterbury for the weekend and visited a gay club that is a 'Laser Quest' by day. I thought this would make it an interesting and super fun place. No no. They switched one light off and put on S club 7 to make it a 'night spot.' We then ended up trying to do hip hop dancing in 'the works.'  This did not go down so well with the other clientele.  

I'm back up in Birmingham now, trying to do lots of work and things. I managed to lose my wallet while out the other night, this resulted in many people buying me drinks. And voila, I am back to being the most drunk person in the club.  Everything goes hazy.  Apparently I was shouting 'fascists!' at people, and a guy who once tried to chat me up but I snubbed was feeding me water and holding me up at the end.  Smooth.  Luckily, some nice person posted my wallet to the address on my driving licence.  How nice. How nice indeed. 

The other day the Kaiser chiefs came into work and I got on well with the one with excessive curly hair, even got guest list for the gig which was fun. 

In other news, I have decided to stay in Birmingham for a while as I have been accepted onto a really good (and free) music management course.

And finally, the bit you've all been waiting for - my love life.  It is dubious and clouded by alcohol as always. Supposed to be going for a drink with a bit of a wanky 26 year old art student who wears strange shoes...might as well, nowt to lose ... oh yeah, except for my dignity."

Also I felt out of place without a 'cool' picture of me wearing a suitable emo / indie outfit with zealously straightened hair, while standing with one tit hanging out. I've returned home, to livejournal, where what is written is rarely read, and safety in anonimity prevails."

"event","My dissertation on advertising in the 1920s has to be handed in a week on Friday.  I know it can be good, so for the next 10 days I shall be sitting infront of my computer ordering my housemates to fetch me coffee, sandwiches and other such bounty.  I'm not sure to what extent this cunning plan shall work. Well, I haven't done much of greatly spectacular interest recently.  Actually I have read about the 'Spectacular Society' - the situationists n all that jazz.
I did hit the bars last week sometime, I then went to the local 24hr mini super market and had a drunken spaz attack at the discovery of 'tinned croissants' expressing my shock and amazement to everyone in the queue waiting to pay.  Wow, were they impressed.
I did a couple of shifts flyering for work. It was bad. I was the only person handing out flyers in Birmingham that was not wearing a trucker cap. Then the fucking preachers started up.  Standing on platforms across town screaming about Jesus. Then the fucking Mexican pan pipers started up.  Christ that was worse.  In what way is standing in the centre of Birmingham wearing a poncho and sombrero, playing the hits of Celine Dion on panpipes to a prerecorded dance beat backing track, attached to a loud speaker,in the rain, EVER A GOOD IDEA?  I almost got caught up in a Hare Krishna dance aswell.  To be fair, I got paid for five hours.  I did 45 minutes max. 
Well I had better get writing then."

Grandad came to stay and as per usual, sat in a chair, got drunk and shouted orders such as ""Cheese Sandwich!"" ""Pie!"" and ""Toilet!"" while we ignore him.  And he still won't flush the chain no matter the size of the turd he has deposited in the toilet. This time my two baby nieces came, they were mostly shitting and crying.  But it was nice to be home I guess.  Free food, good sofa and lack of 'shack' style accomodation which I live in here. 

In other news, work took us out for a lovely night on the town.  We all seem to have 4 hours of our memory missing.  'Management' were all coked up in some vague attempt to be young, carefree and 'one of the kids.' When infact they looked like idiots. Old idiots.

I am currently avoiding my dissertation and reading alot by Will Self.  His take on Oscar Wilde's tale in 'Dorian' is splendid.

Maybe I should do some work.

Note: Garth Marenghi's Dark Place DVD comes out in January.  Did anyone else watch this comic genius? It's a parody of a 'horror writer/actor/film maker' from the 1980s.  And I am the only person I know who found it funny. Or even watched it."

"event","The past 2 months in summary:

I tried giving up alcohol for a short while, this failed as I do not have the skills to cope in certain social situations without being completely off my head e.g. in bars that I have been dragged to that are disgustingly rammed full of fools dancing in Girls Aloud-esque outfits to 'chart hits, commercial r n b and cheese classics' while trying to rub themselves up against male identikit gym whoares.  At least when I'm drunk in those places I believe I am coping (when in reality I'm just being openly abusive to everyone around me.)   

I've noticed that alot of indie rock kids are thick as shit.     

I am now a god mother. Responsibility is not enjoyable, but I'm still rather 'chuffed' that someone picked me to guide the morals of their child.  An interesting choice.   
  
Recently I have been reading lots by Charles Bukowski.

This city is still grey. 

I am attempting to write my dissertation.  I seem to be struggling to get on with it. I would rather be reading other books completely unrelated to what I'm studying.

This summer I plan to go to eastern europe.  Anyone heading that way too?

So I took along a reluctant friend and it turns out, the evening was being run by a bunch of crazy hippies who were living in a derelict nursery.  Thoroughly nice people, excessive facial hair, and a bit creepy sitting in a large boarded up room on plastic chairs with kids drawings everywhere and a bunch of hippies who blatantly wanted my biscuits. There was one man who kept rocking back and forth to the dulcit tones of Michael Moore.  I thought it best not to make eye contact. Wow, crazy hippies are great though - they were obsessed with offering us cups of tea, although my friend later confessed she was worried they may somehow lace it with smack. 

Today, I have tried to tidy my room and watch 'Eraserhead.' I am going to a crappy town up North for the weekend to celebrate a friend's 21st birthday. She claims they like to beat people up 'who are different' (i.e. don't wear plentiful gold jewellery, have several children by the age of 16 and consider Jennifer Lopez as their role model.)  Bugger.  And yes, I am a bit of a snob."

"event","After being begged, BEGGED i tell you, to update more regularly - here goes another marginally dull update on my life. I am no longer with the aforementioned trendy mullet fashion thicky - he came back from his holiday in Majorca and I realised I couldn't bear to listen for the fifth time about how he met a girl who could fit into a suitcase. So that ended. 

This morning I got back from Reading festival. I spent most of the weekend wandering around in my new wellingtons wishing I was 16 and had a backstage pass. Musically, the highlights of the weekend were 80s matchbox b-line disaster and Auf der Maur.  Socially, the highlight was probably being looked after by a boy named Leonard who found me after I had drunk at least 2/3rds of a large bottle of vodka in an attempt to recapture my youth. I haven't got horrifically drunk in a very long time and I forgot there was an exceptionally good reason for this. For those of you who have never been to Reading festival, as soon as the last band finishes, thousands of primarily 14-19 year old post exam results middle class kids head back to their tents where beer and (shock! Rebellion!) weed awaits them.  After consuming all they can, they act ""bonkers"" for several hours before getting a little sleep ready for the next day of musical wonder. For the first 2 nights I wandered around getting more and more agitated by everyone there - matters were not helped by the fact that I was incredibly overtired from working and travelling blah de blah before I even got there.  So anyway, on the last night, we found some lemonade to go with the vodka we had brought with us in the hope of some kind of ""bonkers"" time.  I severely misjudged the quantities I was pouring (it was in the dark you see)and ended up ridiculously drunk.  At first I spent some time telling a disinterested friend that I thought I might actually be a little odd, and still find it quite hard to relate to most people.  I then wandered off into the night where a strange man from south africa in an intriguing hat and coat ensemble cleverly channeled my spouting drunken rage into a game where I slap everyone that walks past me. After a little while, a certain boy brought to my attention that this perhaps was not such a good idea. He did not of course realise that this would mean he was to be my new carer, but alas it was so.  Poor poor Leonard. I was quite possibly still drunk when I left the site this morning - I made my friend pack away my tent, got a cab to the station, and managed to fall asleep on the floor by the on board train toilet.  Also, a word of advice, always lock the toilet door when on a train.  These new 'space age' Virgin trains that have button operated sliding doors proved momentarily great entertainment for us - as the toilet door slid open to reveal a man mid-shit, there was no way he could quickly shut it.  Oh how we laughed at his expense. Of course there is much more to tell about Reading festival: the lame bands, the mud, the shit covered toilets, the overpriced food, those 'crazy' people who wear such things as wedding dresses in an attempt to look interesting / like a twat.  All these super fun tales will come with time.  In fact they won't, because I'm too lazy write about them."

Well, I have been almost dandy these past couple of months. I did wellish on my exams, got myself a job that I kind of enjoy and even have a boyfriend. Yes, a real one. He is a very nice young fellow with a strange liking of fashion and despite my anger before - he has a bit of a trendy mullet.  We got along fine, he doesn't really make me laugh or engage me on an intellectual level but hey, he's good looking and I was bored.  There have been more changes too - my hair is no longer blond and flowing but shortish and very dark -  i look quite the angsty student. I hope to perhaps woo a more interesting man with my new 'edgy' look but until then mullet boy will do. So, how have you all been?"

1. Tell me to stop swearing
2. Believe the Black Eyed Peas are the cutting edge of excellent 'urban' music
3. Ditto for 50 cent
4. Eat a pizza really slowly, cutting it up into tiny pieces with a knife and fork then claiming to be full after three mouthfulls
5. Are short (I am 6ft tall)
6. Enjoy spending lots of time in the gym
7. Enjoy watching 'The O.C.' as it is exciting
8. Become baffled at the mention of philosophy
9. Think that listening to Jimi Hendrix/Rolling Stones is 'cool' and thus having corresponding posters is 'hip'
10. Believe that burping is hideously offensive
11. Tell me to tidy my room
12. Are boring
13. Talk about their current diet all the time
14. Are melodramtic
15. Constantly sing in a 'serious' fashion, then pretend they were 'joke' singing when I laugh at them
16. Want to be in musical theatre
17. Want to be a TV presenter
18. Constantly think they are hard done by
19. Tell me to turn down my music as it is drowning out some shitty soap marketed at 15 year olds who watch it as the characters live out the fantasy their own sad lives fall desperatley short of
20. Believe they are really really good at creative things
21. Stand with their arms folded for an entire gig
22. Drive slowly
23. Enjoy romantic comedies, however lame the format 
24. Fall asleep all the time
25. Have irritatingly posh accents that relentlessly drone
26. Get upset when I laugh at them
27. Make me want to punch them."

"event","Right, rather than do my essay I'm going to talk a bit about Florence.  I fucking love that place. On the last day, I decided that I'd had enough of my sister and mother who were intent on shopping for leather goods for several hours.  And scarves.  And bags. And basically that's what they'd been waiting to do since we arrived.  So I announced I was leaving to track down Machiavelli's tomb and Dante's memorial.  They're both in the same Church.  They're very interesting pieces of sculpture, and I looked like a twat when I took a photo of Dante's memorial.  But never mind.  

Another interesting Florentine experience was the traditional entertainment we had in one restaurant. A creepy pony tailed man singing Bon Jovi to a pre-recorded key board accompaniement.  He also tried to stop us from leaving. I was scared. I think he liked me and my sister.

I managed to get my mum and sister to go to a couple of classical concerts. They had both consumed a bit of wine beforehand though, I was a little worried my mum would shout ""can't you sing us a Lionel Richie one? I like a bit of Lionel"" while my sister added ""Yeah, or something a bit upbeat, ya know, Billy Joel or something."" That kind of thing runs in our family.  At my cousin's wedding (in Eltham palace) my grandad asked the harpsichord player if he could 'give us a tune we can sing along to.'  Luckily they refrained from doing or saying anything other than napping.  

I really should get back to my work. At least I'm not as stressed as I was last night [as you can tell by my incoherant dull rantings about celebrities that are hardly new as targets for such slating.]  I didn't actually give any reasoning for why I hate them .It's just everything about them. Dido and her 'one tune fits all' policy for every song she does, and every video she does is just her pottering around looking a bit sad. Ok, I'm going to stop now.  My livejournal is really going down hill, but I suppose it was pretty low to start with."

Hurrah I hear you all cry. Hurrah indeed. 

I'm a bit stressed with work that I can't be bothered to do, so I'm taking it out on celebrities. I hate Dido and Jennifer Lopez. Really hate them. And Anastacia. The latter sounds like she's gonna be sick everytime she opens her mouth. And I hate the black eyed peas.  Yup those are my top 4 music twats of the moment.  Oh of course there are many more that annoy me, but we only have 'TMF' and 'the Hits' music channels so those are the ones that most often disturb me with their screen presence. 

I almost forgot to mention my glamorous brush with fame. When out and about in Maidstone, the nearby town of fake gold jewellery favourers, I saw Rik Waller in a club.  For those of you who don't know who he is, old Ricky was the fat loser from pop idol a couple of years ago. Probably a nice bloke. Sang 'Mustang Sally'for us all. I was drunk. I had to be. I couldn't leave the place as it was supposed to be a 'fun night out' with my old mates, but seriously, I think every person there was ready to be parodied in some kind of dark new BBC2 comedy.

Crap it's gone past 2am.  I'm giving up on the essay.
Oh and I hate the people who 'comment' on things in tv programs about celebrities.  For example journalistS from crap magazines. 
Right I think I better go to bed before I lash out and perhaps look sternly at a copy of Heat magazine."

"event","Yes, you can all stop weeping now for I have returned. Since my last update, I have pottered around Florence in a whimsical manner and decided to write some kind of novel, although no doubt this will never come to fruition.  It is an amazing city, possibly the best part though is Dante's Church, very dark and gloomy etc.  I went with my mum and my sister which was a little odd as I haven't spent more than about 2 hours with them together for a number of years. My sister, i soon realised is rather moody and prone to turning an art gallery trip into a regimented dictatorship under her directory.  My mother, is actually a little slower than I had ever noticed before, failing to understand a simple foreign monetary system.  She is also one of those people who gets crumbs stuck around the mouth/chin area then doesn't notice for ages, and after it being pointed out to her she continues to ignore it or her poor coordination skills make any attempt of brushing it away pointless.  I am glad I have now vented that point of contention. 

Since coming back from Florence (there is much more to tell about my trip but I can't be bothered to write it) I have attempted to make a start on various essays but failed miserably to do anything wholly constructive. I am still recovering from a friends birthday party on Friday night which took place on a beach. I think she has been watching far too many popular american teen soaps, and forgot that infact we live in England where the sun rarely shines.  None the less we headed to a British sandy shore and set up camp in some dunes, we even wheeled a full size barbeque up there too. However, someone forgot to bring the grill so out of some rusty metal we found buried, we fashioned a form of grill on which a few burgers were hap hazardly cooked and consumed by the more daring/drunk of us. I cooked a sausage on a bottle opener. It took half a fucking hour.  Then a search party went out to purchase a proper grill and came back several hours later with a stolen shopping basket which actually worked rather well, if a little unhygenic.  Apparently it was quite a heist to get that basket - it involved one friend distracting the shop manager with a series of foolish questions, while another started the get-a-way car, and another swiftly removed the basket and headed for the door. After that a 3 litre bottle of Frosty Jack was kindly donated to me. Yes, I am 20, and still drink cider upon occasion. So, so unfortunate. Well I spent the rest of the night sipping that, unable to sleep due to the extreme cold and mumbling absolute rubbish while staring up at the stars.  I arrived home at 8am yesterday and am little worried that my right foot is not yet back in full working order. Since then I have been mainly napping and listening to the Delays album which is rather 'sunshiney' (yes, I know that's not a correct adjective, but you know what I mean.)"

Although I did once go to benidorm actually but I was only 8.  I remember getting caught up in a catholic ceremony - kkk-esque hoods n all.  Free mints were handed out by small boys. Nightmares for weeks.

I am currently 'gig fresh' - yes that aroma of yours and other peoples sweat mixed into one fragrant dew resting on the skin. There's a hint of beer in there, oh and fags of course, and worryingly another tone that reminds me of toilets.  Mind you I was at the Birmingham Academy.  Although I'm not a huge fan of either bands I went to see, I had great fun bouncing around with 14-19 year old boys.  Reel Big Fish were a bit crap actually. I didn't expect them to be great though. However, I did 'ska dance' in a 'wacky' manner which was actually kinda fun.  I ended up in a circle pit on a number of occasions - yes I'm sure your thinking a Reel Big Fish mosh pit must have been CRAZY (with a backwards 'R') all those 12 year olds etc. But even so I am proud to say I lasted for a couple of hours through Goldfinger too, right in the middle. I'm sure all the music snobs will be currently wailing at the thought of paying to go and see such bands, but it's very easy to have a good time at their gigs.  

Everyone else is in bed, God I'm bored. I wish I could just drop off to sleep too damit. Yes, so this 'edgy' photo. Hmmmmmmmm, well this may be hard as I'm not really that 'alternative' in appearence.  Perhaps a well chosen hat will do the trick. The trilby worked for Justin Timberlake, berets for the French (and peculiar 'bohemian' folk), ooooh that's it. A beret. Then people will think I am an alternative intellectual with innate style and fluency in the romance languages.  Or a twat wearing a beret. Other people's photos always show them looking interesting. Or if their face is a bit dodgy, then they focus on the breast/chest area.  Maybe I should balance a beret on my left tit. Not that my face is a bit dodgy of course, it would just avoid hideous embaressment incase I was ever recognised. My livejournal has catapulted me into fame you see. I need some sleep."

Most of the kids weren't too bad actually - although I got really pissed off at some of them who claimed they knew how to play 'Guees Who' but blatantly didn't and then I thrashed them, so I felt bad.  Is it really that hard to grasp the rules? I was almost hurt at their disregard for the game I loved as a child.  Those ugly paper faces brought back so many memories - 'Max' with his big moustache etc, 'Maria' with the green beret.  I got a free rice krispie cake though which made it all worth while.

That was a boring anecdote.  I'm not sure that you could even call it an 'anecdote' really. Yeah anyway, I have to write a cd review of 'The Barbs' by tomorrow - nasty stuff.  False attitudey, despeartely trying to hip, shouty woman type music which is just a bit poo really.  Better go and do that now then get some sleep as I'm supposed to be across the other side of the city by the stupid o'clock tomorrow morning to help with a children's charity half term play scheme thing.  6 hours with 4-11 year olds.  Well I get a free lunch at least."

"event","My Valentine's Day was a bit wanky really.  I was supposed to meet up with the aforementioned foot ball boy, but he cancelled on Friday.  So I sat with my other single friends and watched 'sixth sense' which was on the tv - I hate this sad cliche that girls feel the need to fulfill - ""hey, let's get loads of food and watch a film, cos we're girls."" Having said this I still ate a disturbing amount of Doritos, even though I don't even like them that much.  I really wanted to just go out and do something, but then I rememebred I lost my credit card and I don't have any cash so I had to sit in my room and muse about how sad my life is and how much I just want to run away from everything I do right now.  I think this is the most depressed live journal entry I've ever written - when I started this I vowed never to succumb to expressing actual feelings in this thing due to the hideous level of embaressment that would arise."

"event","I've successfully done very little today, and even found myself watching the Home and Away omnibus while eating Jelly Babies.  It was at this point that I forced myself to retire to my room in order to sort it out, especially as everyone else appears to be getting on with work.  I have the excuse of a mild hang over though, so I've decided to wallow in self pity.  I even bought myself a magazine. I did not however check the date of the copy until I got back from the shop - it would appear that the local Spar is refusing to 'roll with the changes' and head towards modernity - I am now the owner of a June 2003 copy of Rock Sound.  

Last night was spent out on the piss for a friend of a friend's birthday.  Good fun had by all more or less. Met a boy who claims he plays for a very famous football teams' youth squad.  He may have been lying.  And seeing as I don't give a toss about the sporting world, I'm not too bothered even if he was the creator of a fictious background.  He just texted me actually and enquired what I had been up to today - what am I supposed to say? ""Well I got up and the lay on the couch, and took the piss outta people on the telly with my mates while eating many Jelly babies.  Then I read a really old crap magazine before sitting infront of my computer for a while."" I may have to make something up. What sounds alluring? Shopping? Working? Some kind of sporting activity? Helping the needy? 

Well I better go and get room sorting as Stars in their Eyes on is pretty soon.  Yes, a favourtie saturday night fixture of mine. It's an incredibly amusing televison programme.  Don't these people realise that any form of karaoke is even a vaguely good idea when both you and the audience are completely wasted?  It always seems to be the people who have the most boring jobs that enter as well (of course) - there was once a lady who worked in a cardboard box factory. No joke.  I could talk about the comedy value of Stars in their Eyes for hours, hours I tell you, but it is time for me to go."

"event","I just tried to upload some pictures, but no, it appears I am far too technologically spasticated to cope with the complex demands of the computing world.  Ah well never mind.  You will all just have to get by without feasting your eyes on my obviously radiant beauty.  So since my last update a few hours ago, a friend of mine that I have known since I was merely a baby, gave birth to her very own child.  Shit.  I can't even keep my room tidy and turn up to lectures, she's now completely responsible for another very small person. Hmmmmmm... I feel like I should be acting maturley or something, casually sipping a glass of red wine while reading The Daily Telegraph, with property programmes quietly buzzing in the background on the television.  Not looking up comedic Beverley Hills 90210 memoribilia on ebay at 1.20am.  I have been doing constructive things though - attempting to secure some kind of work experience with film and television companies due to my ever growing fear of the whole ""what am I doing with my life?"" etc notion which is currently at the forefront of my mind - Despite the fact I'm only 20. I would recall some amusing anecdotes from the past couple of days, visions of innocent pedestrians tripping over etc, but alas, I am tired, and it is time for bed. Goodnight, and let's hope the next entry will be overflowing with extraordinary wit and humerous tales of life in Birmingham."

"event","Since my last update, the evil forces of time hath made me 20 years old.  I am now a young woman, no longer a teenager. I have also recently become rather obsessed with Tim Burton - not in a sexual way, just in a creative manner, if you see what I mean.  Also that music fellow Danny Elfman, who composes most of the scores for the former's films.  Late night addiction to ebay, has also desceneded upon me.  My room is messier than before. I have much less work to do.  I met a welsh boy while visiting a friend at another uni, plus a very thick sounding Brummie with an incredibly pronounced 'fashion mullet,' plus more dealings with people from the past.  That just about covers my life in the past few weeks, the level of emptiness is a little sad."

Then Im off to stay with a mate from home in her new art college setting - i feel like I should wear something inspiring to impress all of her new 'creative' friends. Perhaps some kind of 'bonkers' hat. Or not.

Highlight of the day so far: a quick trip to the corner shop to fetch snacky goodness on a budget of 90p.

Lowpoint of the day: Passing poshy rugby boy with ironically over-camp name who I found out through personal experience last term, is a complete wanker and not particularly good at treating ladies very well.

Am now on second lollipop trying to think of something insightful to write in my essay that will wow lecturers across the department.  Oh shit its my turn to do the washing up. I may have to feign illness, or injury, or even squirrel attack to get out of it. Not gonna happen though. Bugger."

"event","I managed to hand in my 4000 word essay on Byzantine gender roles.  The 1st ordeal is over. I now have the other 2 to do. I missed 'neighbours' for that essay damit. My sacrifices to academia are ever growing.The bastards at the student paper didn't give me a cd to review this week - I wanted that gary jules album so i could sit and lament about something - weep, stare out of the window etc. I don't really have anything to lament about, but I'm sure I'd think of something. Instead I shall just do the normal dancing like a fool to outkast and Watching downloaded episodes of south park and family guy in my 'work breaks' - these breaks tend to turn into a couple of hours tho. I just really need some sleepy goodness - soft pillows, big duvet, god damit why did I decide to do history, maximum essay subject. True there are a few fit men on my course, but most of them have silly names and play rugby. The ones that don't are the ones who write down eveything the lecturer says. have you ever seen those people? All you can hear is them ripping out another A4 sheet to continue their ridiculously large amount of notes. Secretly I wish I could do that, but I swear I physically can't. I have to give up after half an hour and look out the window or take a small nap. Well, better get on with those essays."

I'v just had to tear myself away from late night jerry springer - it was ""we are in our 70s and still sleeping around,"" no, im not joking, they were making threatening gestures armed with zimmerframes and everything. thoroughly disturbing. I also watched 'porn valley,' that was interesting.  These past few days have been a little dull, I have to spice them up with dubious past midnight sky tv programs. Plus Im a big perv at heart."

Oh well, never mind. It'll be fine. I'm sure. Ahem. I have found it much more spiritually enriching to dance round my room like a knob to that Outkast song 'Hey Ya'and watch daytime tv. I really can't be arsed to consider the notion of masculinity in ancient Byzantium. I've also been house hunting cos we decided that all 6 of us are gonna move into a house closer to the uni as we are lazy lazy bitches. THis has been fun - mainly cos you can potter round other peoples houses and laugh at their countless Lord of the Rings posters. One guy's room was coverd in Buffy the Vampire slayer pictures, and on top of his wardrobe there appeared to be all the episodes ever made on video. Seriously they were stacked everywhere and it was horifficaly creepy. i mean, I know I watch a lot of 'neighbours' but this guy was sick."

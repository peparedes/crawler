"event","i'm walking down the street on the sidewalk by myself, in a town i don't really recognize. it's getting dark outside and i start hating the fact i am by myself. i take my cell phone out of my purse and act like i am busy on my phone, pretending not to notice the man walking in my direction on the sidewalk. he stops me and asks for my phone. my reply didn't satisfy him as he reached his hand forward to grab either my phone or my purse, but i saw it coming and swung my arm out of his path. i scream. i turn around and start running in the opposite direction. i can hear his fast footsteps following close behind. i desperately look for any signs of an open store with a someone who can help me. finally i see a light on. he is still following me. i look into the large display window and see you standing there, reading a book. i scream your name. all you do is look up. and then he finally reaches me. he pries my phone from my hand and tries to pull my purse from my grip. i scream your name again begging for you to help me. all you do is look up and say you will be right there. i'm struggling with the man, fighting as hard as i can. i scream again. this time you don't look up. and the man runs off with my purse and i am standing there in front of you so vulnerable and hurt, and you can't even look at me in the face.

i think dreams are just bullshit really. i rarely ever remember them and they are usually just some stupid event, but this one i cant get out of my head. i keep going over it and over it in my head trying to decide if it actually means something or if it really is just a bunch of bullshit. i still get the chills when i think about it."

"event","my life is sort of pissing me off. i keep crying all the time. over nothing really. like i will be watching tv and just start crying. i don't understand. my dad is sick. the doctors don't know what is wrong. he could have this shitty ass disease where your muscles slowly all stop working and you eventually lose the ability to use the muscles you need to breathe. freakin scary. i think i'm becoming addicted to gambling at the chumash. but it's weird because i don't care if i win or lose, and if i lose..which i almost always do it's only 20 bucks. but i feel like i go there for the social aspect of it, as lame as that sounds. you would be surprised at how many different people you can meet sitting at a table.madison turned 2 the other day. i've been getting really good grades in school lately. which would be cool if my parents cared. today i won kelly clarkson tickets off the radio. and in may i bought tickets to katy perry. something to look forward to. i've been called off 2 times at work at marian this week so i have had so many extra days off and i feel so guilty about it. and i don't know why i wrote this."

i think i am sick...and it sucks. yesterday was fun. i hung out with lindsay and theresa. we went out to eat at this pizza place and on the way home we stopped at spencers. okay so there usually are these two really hot guys working there and i got bummed out because when we went inside i didnt see them. so i said ""man one of them is usually working."" and as i turned down another grocery isle one was the guys was standing right there. so lindsay decided to say, ""hey melissa one of them is working."" it was soo funny...but a little imbarrasing.then we went back to lindsays house were she tried to glue her boobs together. didnt work out to great.



i'm bored and was looking at my old livejournal.

"event","this is the worst. i feel like i have already failed on madison. this isn't how it's suppost to be. i fucked up and she is paying the consequences. she is never going to have a ""real"" family. her dad will live somewhere else and she most likely will not get to see him on a regular basis like she should. she never even got a chance. so not fair and so fucked up. i just feel so bad that her family life is going to be hard. i keep having really shitty days going over it and over it in my head. i don't think i will ever forgive myself for doing this to her. i hope she doesn't hate me for it when she gets older. 

i'm trying. i'm killing myself in the process. why do i feel so alone and helpless? i feel so unappreciated..but what the hell do i do? the other day i just broke down with this overwhelming feeling of like oh shit i am repsonsible for her and everything she does or needs. how the hell am i going to do this? i'm tired. so tired of everything. i'm crumbling. my whole life i have constantly always had a smile on my face and built myself up as some great person.none of what am i writing makes sense. i feel so stupid trying to get attention. 

when am i going to be okay with my life and where i'm going. its never going to stop. have too many things in my head and they all lead my feeling hopeless. fuck my life. fuck myself. good job melissa."

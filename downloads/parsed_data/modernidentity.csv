"event","So, I'll be the first one to admit that I tend to make the occasional offensive jokes, I mean it's not like i single anyone group out.  I will poke fun at everyone, including my own, but those of you who know me know I'm joking, those of you that don't can think what you will.  Even tho I do make these tasteless, yet hilarious puns, I do take alot of things like, hate, seriously.

What I don't understand, and don't think I will ever, is the audacity some people have.  How can people who have been discriminated against so unjustly, sit by and hate another set of people for who or what they are.  These thoughts occurred to me when I was watching all the election bull shit.  I watched as the majority of states voted so strongly against something that really has no barring on them as people, and that my friends, is the right for me to marry whom I chose.  It got me thinking about this speech that my best friend Stephany had to write for school.  Prior to the speech she had to take a survey in her class on the opinions her classmates had on her topic.  Her topic, obviously was gay marriage.  The majority of her class was in fact black, and the response she got to her survey was horrible, she got remarks like, ""that's disgusting"" and my first reaction was, ""at one point people thought YOU were disgusting!""  how dare those people complain about prejudice, and turn around and project the very actions that had oppressed their ancestors for so long, onto another group of people.  Then I took it even farther, and remember when i was living in LA, and those that lived there know that the city is predominately jewish.. they pretty much own everything, I remember some friends talking shit about black folks and their parents doing the same thing, altho some of the jokes made me chuckle, I thought, you aren't kidding... you really don't like this group of people, and again, jewish people have experienced probably one of the largest bouts of hate in history.  One would think logically that they, of all people, know what it's like to be hated for what they are, so therefore, would never dare to hate someone else for what they are!  It goes with out saying that when you project attitudes, that you are so strongly against when it's projected on to you and your people, that it pretty much negates your right to complain.  Now i'm not in any way saying that all people are like this, i'm merely stating that i can't believe that there are people who have been hated so much and complain about it, and protest it, and live their life to fight against it, that still have hate in their heart for another group of people.

I read this quote the other day... ""become the change you seek to make""... now that goes out to all the people who have been discriminated in this world and still discriminate against others."

"event","so those pesky british with their hot ass accents, think they can just come on into town and take whatever they want... well.. they're right!! hahah.  i thought i'd turn and run at the sight.. but it wasn't all that bad.  it was weird, i mean, well different.  

it's only happened twice in the past year and a half or so... and both times it was just off.. maybe it's cus  you're used to your SNES, then you get playstation and it's different.. exciting.. but at the same time you miss super mario bros. and you know nothing can touch that!

so this is really funny, only cus i knew it was gonna happen eventually.  lets face it, people suck! and you can't trust em... there was someone who i actually confided in and trusted and as it turns out he ended up being just as bad, if not worse than people of the past.. i wont get into detail as i dont wanna dwell on it, i just thought it was funny, and i guess i should have seen it commin'.  goes to show, becareful who you trust and who you call a friend.. then again.. there's comfort in knowing that karma's not just a bitch.. but a fucking bitch! haha..

so it was pride last sunday, and i'm not the one to be all about gay day, but i went, and i went alone.. which was pretty great cus i got to spend time with people i don't usually see all the time. i got there and ran into steven and rosie, i miss rosie.. she's great... then timo calls and i met up with him, but before that i was caught in a fucking homo sardine can.. what the fuck is wrong with people... you've got about 100 people trying to go in one direction, and seeing that.. another hundred think it's a great idea to go in the opposite direction.. creating a fucking mess!! i lifted my feet off the ground for a second and i was just floating amoungst these people.. wanting to puke, cus i hate when people touch me anyway.. i finally got thru... and if i wasnt clostrophobic before.. you better believe i am now!.. so i hung out with timo and his friend, it was kool hanging out with him.. then Matt called and we had sushi, then went out and played pool and what not.. we tried to see farenheit 911, but it was sold out everywhere... it was just nice to go somewhere alone and end up  doing whatever i wanted not having to worry whether the person i went with wanted to do it to... and i find when your alone and in a large mass of people.. your kind of forced into random conversations... and those are the best.. the only thing that was really horrible was the fucking make up.. i mean, do drag queens think they look good?!?! i mean, there's  a reason that when ever you see a certain style of make up.. you're all... ew they look like a drag queen.. all of you look the same...c'mon now!! BLEND!!!!! i've got extra 224 brushes.. you can have them.. so long as you promise to use that shit! i think i want to set up a both next year and devote the day to showing these tragedies how do beat themselves down!  i could make some serious money too.. thanks for that idea timothy.. ;o)

so i'm on a mission! i need to find tickets to the Morrissey show at the HOB on the 17th.. my friend christopher and i HAVE to go.. so if anyof you know anyone selling tickets... let a nigga know!!

next week is my first shoot of the summer! i can't wait. there are two major focuses this summer.. my book and Detroit!

sunday is the blood brothers and the chromatics... i can't wait to finally meet lily... i hope she's as great as stephany says... stephany is usually right.. so... ;o) haha."

"event","oh what a weekend!! friday night my roomate brian played a show at Jinx, and as always Hanalei is amazing and the eyes got a bit misty as they ususally do upon hearing certain songs.  i hate the fact that i can't just put the CD in my computer and play it as loud as i possibly can seeing how he's my roomate and that would just a be a bit weird, so now i have to save it all for when he plays.  which might be for the best, i'd hate to be over it all.  so after the show i went with Gabe and Brenden to Gabe's.. and might i say.. brenden is pretty fucking awesome... he's this really quiet, sort of reclusive, and observant kid.. who, the whole night, sat back and studied everyone.  i couldn't decide whether he was judging people, or simply watching and trying come up with conclusions of his own about faces he'd probably never seen, nor see again.  due to my utter bordem.. or inebriation.. you chose, i started making up script in my head about what he could be thinking.  i found myself cracking up as my imagination ran rampid.  after while tho, it did loose it's novelty so i moved on to more drinking.  then someone in particular walks in and immediately feels the need to start making out with me... straight people.. you all suck! but whatever, he's a friend and i was bored.. where's the harm?! i'll tell you where it is... it's in the eyes of the people around you, that may or may not know you.. i'll explain that in a minute... anyway, i left with Brenden and Gabe and went home and passed out... the next night was this huge party at some people's house that were moving and wanted to throw one last hoorah... Brenden and I get there and it's kool.. we get pretty drunk and all my friends where there, it seemed like it was gonna be a chill night... until ofcourse, above said ""particular person""'s ex girl friend comes.. and the topic of the previous night came up.. and of course i admitted to making out with him.. we've done that plenty of times, it's no secret.. but i guess there were rumors flying around about things going further than that.. but i quickly put the kabash on that shit!  i should have known the night was gonna get worse... but the conversation i was having with someone that, at one point, hated me, made me feel like everything was going to be fine.. then some stupid suburban girl was talking to my friend Neil and she was just oh soo stupid.. and annoying.. i dunno how it started, but i ended up getting into a bitch argument with her.. and i tore her to pieces.. verbally ofcourse.. and it just wasnt a good thing.. i definately felt bad afterwerd, i felt like i killed Neil's game... anyway.. i leave with 3 people.. two of which consisted of ""the particular person"" and the person who, ""at one pointed hated me"" but now we're all good... so we're walking and it's time for me to go one way.. and i really didnt want to bounce alone, as it was Puerto Rican Pride day and there was some crazy shit going on in the streets... so i told one of them, they were walking me home.. and somehow that escalated into the other thinking i was trying to take the other one home to fuck... i was kind of in shock.. i mean.. where the fuck did that come from?!?! as i said earlier.. that i would explain the problem lies within the eyes of others and what they think... well obviously, someone thinks.. and maybe some people think.. or get the impression by certain actions that i'm that kind of boy... well a big FUCK YOU to those people... but at the same time.. who could blame them.. i mean, i'm the type where i don't care what people think of me...so i act how i act and the people that know me, know me and reguardless of whether i kiss someone or not... that doesn't mean i would take home anyone who'd have me, so i guess those that think i would, are the ones that see these actions and come to their own conclusions, which is fine everyone is entitled, but dont go projecting those assumptions onto me, when they obviously have no foundation seeing as how you don't know me.  all in all, i think tho i have realized that maybe i get a bit carried away when intoxicated, and the best way to remedy it is by taking a long overdue break...  it does no good to get mad at those that have developed whatever opinions. i come across how i come across, maybe i just need to change how i come across...cus it's obviously not portraying me very accurately... or is it?"

I come to the bright idea that i'd go to Aldi.. now for those that don't know about aldi... it's the shit.  everything is DIRT cheap.. grocery's that is... so it's kind of hard to not run rampid in that place.. i mean mustard for 39 cents.. come on! as you can guess i went a bit overboard and filled a whole cart.. not thinking about how i was going to get home with all of it while riding a bike that is a bitch to ride in the first place.  Believe it or not, all of it came out to only 40 bucks... 40BUCKS!!! for alllll that food... i was so excited.. still not thinking of my transportation situation.  At Aldi you have to bag  yer own shit.. so i filled about 5 or 6 bags... heavy ones too.. got outside.. and was like.. FUUUUCK!! the journey home sucked vag! it was horrible... the bags kept hitting the spokes.. so one tore open.. i fell off a couple of times.. then i decided just to walk the bike and have the groceries on each side of the handle bars.. but the bags were too heavy.. ones i would hold while holding the bars would cut off a nigga circulation... i was seriously not about this at all... and to top it off.. it was about a bizillion degree's out... blah.. bottom line.. just cus stephany and her aunt can carry groceries on the handle bars of their bikes.. doen't mean i can."

"event","There's something about putting on some old school stuff like Das EFX, FU-Shnickens, EPMD, Eric B. and Rakim, and Camp Lo that creates this amazing nostalgia of days before i knew what love was, before people became shady (atleast the people i knew at the time), and before i really ever had to take life seriously.  it was all about B-boyin' it up at the gym after school, drivin' around town with a packed RX-7, the occasional fight or two or five, weekend excursions to Seattle for our only 16 and over club the annex, spittin game to little hot ass asian gangsta bitches, and just kickin' it wit'cha boys.

these days, i know what love is and lost it, people just started to get real shady, i have a career a life and bills that all need to be taken quite seriously, have you seen me try and break again?? it's not pretty, a car? who can afford a car?? i'm too old for stupid fights, no more Seattle, definately no 16 and over clubs, and fo sho no kickin game to any little asian gangter girls.  I still bro down with the boys tho.. they may not be the same ones as back in the day, or even the ones from a few years ago, but we still kick it tough and i love em to death.

bottom line is that we're all getting older, some getting wiser and life keeps going and changing.  things might not ever be like they used to be and life definately gets harder and more complicated, but we'll always have little things to remind us of the good times. and if we.. well, I, can remember to grab on to those, maybe the bad times won't seem so bad."

Oh well, fuck it, i got shafted for a position at work anyway.
 i've decided that this summer is all about me and my book.  i've set up two shoots so far with some great photographers in the city, so that should go well.  By the end of the summer i'll definitley be ready to send that shit out to agencies and what not.  I'm really looking toward The Wall Group. they're pretty fucking tyte.. Danilo, this hair stylist is in it and he's the shit.  The make up artists for them have their shit on point too, so that's gonna make it a bit hard, my stuff is gonna have to be amazing.. there's always Dion Perrenou, she's a friend of mine, but her agency is a bit smaller, we'll see..
 OH...!! and i shaved my head!!!  the past couple of days here, have been so unbearably hot and humid, and i have frizy curly hair naturally, so needless to say my hair was looking a bit haggard. It started to get all super thick and what not, and just made me feel 10 times hotter (temp wise) so i got super frustrated and was like fuck it... and shaved it off.  so now i have no hair, except for the rat tail i left in the back.. don't hate.. tails are hot!  My friend Tony, last night walked into our house and looked right at me, gave me a weird look and took a double take and was like..

BITCH WORKED IT OUT!!! uhm yeah i wish i had pictures to show you all.. but yeah... my camera was in the CAR! grrr... anyway.. i had a blast.. and shaun and i havent danced like that together in a long time... so that added to it all!

once the show was over.. reality checked us.. how the fuck were we gonna get home?? and get my car.. and my house keys that are in the car??!!?!? then i made a call and my knight in shinning armour rode in, in a shinny black Xterra to save the day!! how sweet was he..?? it was all kinds of late and he came picked us up then drove us to the tow place and waited till the guy got back so i could atleast get my house keys out... thank goodness for steven!! and for the record.. i tried calling lots earlier.. either way... thank you soooo much! you rock!!.. but i still want my bday present.. haha.. kidding..!!

HEY!! watch out"" i was kind of like.. huh?? then i start to turn my head towards traffic.. and i dont know why but i decided to take a step away from the curb.. now keep in mind this was all in a matter of milla seconds... then just as i'm mid step and my head faces forward............... WHAM!!!! a FUCKING bus knocks my hat right off my freaking head!!!!!!!!!!!!! i felt the metal of the bus brush my nose!!! OH MY GOD!! i was in complete shock.  if i had waited just a moment longer i totally would have been that girl on final destination!! i went pale, i was sweating... people were screaming, cus the bus was sooo close to me that when it hit my hat off and i stumbled back.. they thought it hit me... thank goodness for that random guy...and can you believe that the bus didnt even stop to check if i was ok... asshole!

we had a party at my house, and i have to say a special thank you to my best friend shaun.. he really made my birthday special... he hates party planning but he totally hung out with me ALL day and helped me shop, clean, and set up.. what would i do with out my shaun.. who knows?? some great people came out and it was kool.. drank alot!!! i think by the end of the night i was babbling about shit that didnt make any sense.. haha... but whatever, i'm allowed.
another person really made the night great, JJ.. he doesnt even know me all that well, but because he cares for shaun soo much he totally sat with me at a time when i needed it.  We really bonded and i'm glad to say that i have a new friend, and i dont call many people my friend.. thank you JJ.. and i'm soo happy that you and shaun found each other!

"event","break ups are hard.. especially when you know that that person is the one you wanna be with for the rest of your life.. 

time heals all wounds and altho i dont expect to fully recover from all this.. i know that it's for the best and i'll come out a stronger person..

i realized that i cant rely on anyone else to fulfill my happiness.. your friends can only be who they are and sometimes they dont have the tools to give you every thing you need all of the time.. and they dont have to..i cant rely on any one particular person ex or not.. to make me happy either..the sooner i learn to rely solely on me to be happy, the sooner things will get better.. 

i dont expect an over night transformation, but i think that by starting to tell myself all these things, i can start to move on with my life and not hang on to what might or might not be... that's no way to live your life.. i can no longer do things in hopes that it will make me and the ex get back together.. as much as i know that's what i ""want"" it's no way to really live..

sometimes people need space in order to figure out who and what they really are.. especially people who have never had that opportunity.  and just because they need to spread their wings and fly doesnt mean that they love you any less, it just means they need to fly.. and if things are meant to be.. before you know it they'll fly home. 

if you love someone soo deeply, you need to learn to let them go...be free my sweet, but always know you have a home to come back to when yer ready.."

so the ride was great... i started the driving and i drove all night long.. the only thing was that shaun and stephany both fell asleep leaving me to fend for myself.. by the time like.. 2 o'clock rolled around i couldn't keep my eyes open.. yunno how yer eyes get all super jittery and you cant keep them open.. well times that by like a million and that was me.. i think i blacked out a couple of times cus i would wake up all super startled and get all freaked out.. like.. OH MY GOD.. did i just fall asleep???!!! then the horror would keep me awake for a little while till the exaustion kicked in again.. they finally woke up and everything was all good again.. yes!! i know the danger of driving that tired...

so we talked alot the whole way and it was kool.. shaun started to drive the minute the sun came up, which felt like forever.. every thing was smooth up until about 70 miles outside of Olympia.. which is where we were headed first.. my left front tire blew out... it was crazy... we were soooo close.. i'm proud of shaun and i tho.. we kept out composer and flipped the butch switch and changed the tire in like 5 minutes... yayay!!!.. haha..changing a tire is no big deal, we were just being silly.. a cop was nice enough to stop and she didnt even give us shit for pulling over on the left side of the freeway... which normally would result in a ticket... and seeing as how its quota time here, she totally could have been a snatch.. but she was way kool...

anyway, well i'm meeting the agency up there, Celestine and they are gonna look over my work.  i'm a bit nervous, probably cus we are all our own worst critic and add insecurity to that and then you get nervous..i shouldn't be tho, i mean, i'm good at what i do and for the amount of time if been doing what i'm doing i've gotten some great work and opportunities to work with some great people, so i guess i should be proud and no matter what the outcome it'll be the right one even if it's not the one that i want.. it just means that there is something better coming.

so i realized that the ex would never do that to me and that i probably was over reacting a bit when confronting him.  we talked and it's all good. i think that we're starting to communicate alot better now which makes me happy.  i love him and i know that he loves me and altho we arent together for the moment we'll always have a special place in eachothers heart that no one can ever touch.

"event","so what do you do when you find out that there is a good chance that yer ex boyfriend cheated on you.. and did things that were supposed to be special to your relationship?

well i dont know who to believe at this point it's like, the person the my ex elegidly (sp) cheated with really has no reason to lie.. i mean what's the point, this guy doesnt give a fuck about shit like that .. he sleeps around and is a big whore.. but he's not about bull shit... but then again, i cant say he's trust worthy, i mean.. it's roy for christs sake.. but why would he lie..?? 

as far as the ex is concerned, he says that it never happened and roy is lieing.  of course he would tho.. i mean he did lie to me about roy before so you can see why it's hard for me to believe him now.. he says that i am going to believe roy no matter what he says so why should he waste his time trying to convince me of his innocence.  isnt' that a cop out?? well not always i suppose... he also read my last entry about letting stuff go and that i cant bring up the past when he lied to me about roy.. i should take my own advice and let that go.. and yeah he's right i should.. but in a special circumstance like this..  i mean it's the main reason why i'm having a hard time trusting him.. and i think it's valid to bring it up.. im not using it against him or trying to stay mad about that.. i'm just letting him know thats' why.. 

i dunno, i want sooo badly to believe him.. i mean, i or anyone would hate to live the rest of their lives thinking that the one person they truely loved could and did hurt them in such a manor.  i mean people have been known to puposely make themselves nieve to such tragic things just to spare them the hurt.  and altho i enjoy a good fight and sometimes i like to be mad.. this is way beyond that, and i wouldn't wish this feeling on my worst enemy.  this is no joke, it's not something to have a petty little fight about just to be mad...

i dont know what i'm supposed to do now.. i'm soo confused, i know that we're broken up and there is nothing i can do about it now.. but it doesn't change how much it hurts.  i also know i'm not gonna get any answers tonight or tomorrow even, so for now i think i'm just gonna let it go.. cus if i dont i wont sleep and i'll probably be calling him all night.. and well that's not kool.. he's in seattle right now, and i'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt till i get to talk to him in person then i can legitimatley make my decision, which i think is gonna be the second hardest thing i have to decide... i'm still wondering if the first one was the right one.."

ok.. i went to a club with shaun and jason.. and before we were about to get in i realized i had done my hair without putting anything in it and we were in Washington so my hair got all super frizzie and big.. an i had asked shaun if it was all fuct and he was like .. yeah it is.. but there's nothing you can do now... but then i looked down and i had my sisters keys in my hands and her apt was across the street.. so i went there to get product but the keys werent my sis's they were stevens... so i couldnt get in.. then i looked over and in the parking lot of the complex was a girl who was all super dope.. in a dope ass 60's convertable talking on her cell.. i walked towards her and saw that she had mad crazy fashion.. she had these checkered socks on and i had my checkered vans on... i was like.. who is this girl.. then i saw a group of girls walking up and i figured she was talking to them on her cell.. then i realized that it was Debbie Scott... i started to call out her name but it was like she was ignoring me or didnt hear me.. she started driving away, but not out of the parking lot...i even tried to get infront of the car and i kicked it.. and all she did was wave.. she pulled into another parking spot on a hill.. but didnt stop... she got all crazy and kept driving.. right off the fucking hill... i was screaming out to her even more i was sooo scared.. it wasnt a small hill.. then all those girls freaked out and started screaming too... she plunged off of one hill.. then kept going off another one... slaming into trees guard rails.. everything.. she was like all super kamakazi like.. and that's sooo not debbie.. so the girls and i made it down to the bottom and all she was doing was laughing... we were like.. what the fuck.. she was like... hahahah i did it!! then i found six dollars on the ground and handed it to her.. why? i dont know.. then she finally hugged me and i asked how she had been.."

so i leave for  Seattle on Tuesday and i'm sooo excited.  i need to get the hell outtah LA for a while.  i'm a bit apprehensive about a few things tho.. well mainly about my meeting with Celestine, what if i get in? do i move back? what if i dont get in, how is that gonna effect me?  i keep telling myself that if i dont get in then that just means i was meant to stay in LA for a reason... yeah right.. like anyone should be made to stay in the ""city of angels""... whatever... that's more like cruel punishment.. hah.. nah i do like it here..

so steven called today.. and the weirdest thing is that i was just thinking about all the many arguements we've had and how i reacted to them.  Yunno, i never really realized that every time he did something fuct up, i'd get pissed, but even when there was nothing to be pissed about anymore i'd find a reason to keep the fight going.. and trust me.. i would pull some shit right outtah my ass... (no not literally).. just to stay mad.. dude.. what the fuck was wrong with me.. why did i feel the need to pound it in his head that he wronged me, why couldnt i just state my case, fight or discuss it.. and let it go.. why keep it going when there was nothing to go on anymore..
so who was wrong? i mean he did some shady shit, but i wouldnt let it go.. even when he did realize it... i just made it worse..
well.. i guess it's time to work on the whole letting petty things go.."

"event","when i moved to LA i started to go by preston and for the past two years that's been my name.  

i recently broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years and it's been such an emotional trip, he was the first and only person i've ever been with.  

anyway, well since we broke up i decided i needed to really figure out who i am as an individual and what i want out of my life.  i pondered on how to start in that direction and i think the best way to figure out who i am is to be me.. completely, and that includes going back to my real name, the name my mother gave me.. which is Thomas. i think is the first step to my self realization.  for those who know me, they know that this is a big thing for me. i know it's the right thing to do, i have alot to figure out and i think this puts me on the right track.

just for clarification, i had to go by preston for work.. so it was a legit thing.

as for steven (the ex), well there will be sooooo much more to come on that.."

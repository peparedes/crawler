<b>I realli realli like this man, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. But..</b>I think he's afraid to admit that he likes <b>me..</b> or maybe not. He's such a complicated being, it's hard to decipher what his real feelings are. It's hard to be what he wants you to be simply because he leads to the end of the road with the trophie sitting five feet away from you, only to have the trophie blown away by a passing car. A passing car with him being the driver. He is so wonderful, and so sweet and just UGH! He's also such a god damn tease. He ... is the most <[wonderful]> being ever. I like him, and always will, i just hope one day that he will feel the same. Everyday, he hints that he might feel that way, but he let's you down by flirting with someone else. It kills me to see him flirt with <b>Maddy</b>. It even kills me when he flirts with <b>Ali</b> because even though she sais she doesn't like him, that might now always be the case. I hate this, and I want it to stop, but in my mind. I know, that it will <b><i>never</i></b> stopd. I will always and forever...Like You &hearts;Spencer Hussen&hearts;."

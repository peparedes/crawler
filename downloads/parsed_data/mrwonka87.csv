""there ya r thereya are!! i seee u"" ""where are u u silly boy!"" def the funniest thing ever. we tried visiting like 5 or 6 guys and none of them let us in there house...not one not even for a sec! so i def didnt get home till 8 which sucked. and i was hyper as all mighty hell all night. it was by far the greatest sunday ever.

"event","today wasnt a half bad day. i was tired as fuck, and failed my government and french test, but despite that, it wasnt half bad. i got into nhs which i dont htink is that big of a deal but my whole family is unbelievablely proud escepcially my may maw cuz im the first one in the sniecikowski family to get in it. 

so i get outta the shower call ernie and we went to the dls hockey game which was kinda gay. after we chilled there tryin to figure out somethin to do for about a half hour. so we went to fraser and met a few guys up there, stood in the parking lot tryin to figure out what to do next. so we just came to my house. def had a buttload of ppl in my house who i never met b4. so all the gurls left and it was me and kaylee chillend with like 8 guys, which like 4 were pretty hott. we were pimps.
everyone was leavin and they were like ""ok were goin to wendys"" so me and kaylee went cuz i had to drop her off at home. the dinning room part of hte resturant was def closed so we sat in the back of this hott guy dans truck, pulled uo and ordered was bout the funniest thing ever got alotta funny looks for that one. but i guess u might have had to be there.

so yea basically tonight met alotta hot guys and still no one to go to prom with. so as each day goes by its lookin like im not goin. o well.

"event","today was one of those days were i could just sleep the whoooole day...sigh.

the only good thing about today is thaqt smeegals is goin to camp with me!!!!!! YYYYAAAAAY i love smeegals ( even if she is hairless) so much me her and kathy form the triangle of gayness. haha and now me and smeegals are hte snova fan club. shes  snova #1 im snova #2 and snova is hte head honcho...wow were gay. i dont no what i would do without her

im so proud of myself after school i went and ran and did all are lil exersizes for track i was quite tired at the  end but it will hopefully all pay off in the end.

hmmmm yea so it looks like its a negative on prom. def dont have anyone to go with....sigh the downside to being a lozer, not being able to get a date...wait is there an upside??? hmmm interesting...

is anyone else not want to grow up?? im scared shitless i so do not want to go live on my own after highschool. its only like a year and a half until then. it freaks me out hearin how everyones goin away but what really scares me is when i hear ppl goin into the military. for some reason that just  is like a huge reality check that i have to start being more responsible and saveing up more money. i dunno  i just really dont want to grow up. sure  i kinda want to but im scuuurrrrred. i was all fine and dandy bout goin to college until my maymaw said i couldnt stay with my cuzins and that i had to live in a dorm for at least my first year. grrrrr damn her. so now im freakin out. sigh. i didnt really start thinkin bout it till portnova gave  that assiment  and my group chose peter pan ( my all time fav movie growin up) which made me want to be a kid again.    remember in like 8 grade college seemed so far away and it was the last thing on ure mind?? ...and is this really the best itme of our lives??hmm i guess one day ill no.

i miss my whore i wish he was here....will he ever be??one day, maybe"

Friday was one of the best days in a long ass time. I get to school and of course i forot to put a school shirt on. i swear like every other week i foget to put my shirt or sox on. but anyway jackie had an extra shirt in her locker so i didnt have to wear the schools. Then there was show boat...wow. gotta love show boat. but sadly enough it was the last year for everyones favorite act. tear. and it just made my life when everyone started chanting ""susie"" as mrs. portnova left the stage. the rest of the day was a joke, which means doing no real work. I almost peed myself when portnova started braiding my hair randomly. And its official i love mrs cody. shes to funny and doesnt give a shit. Randomly in class me and maria start singing shakeria and dancing. god i love maria shes to cute. 
 so i come home do some pointless shit errands come home shower watch the pistons (gotta love the stones), and half time roles around down by 11, so sad and depressed. But to make everything all great again i go and hang out with joe after a year of not seein him. it was some fun shit, saw along came polly pretty funny movie.

saturday- went to lakeside with sam and stopped and got bagels from jessica at elaines bagels ""cant beat a better bagel"" i highly recommend u goin and gettin some free bagels. then i sat at home for a while waiting for ed to decide if we were goin to the game or not and of course it was a negative.sigh. so i was stuck watchin the pistons on tv once again. But me and my maymaw went back to lakeside so i could get some clothes for the big trip yaaaaa only 14 more days!!! yaaaaayyyy......ok thats enough of that.

o yea and i got a nice random call last week, def totally confused on that one still. o well only time will tell.

"event","Tuesday started off to be a boring day. Had my last day at therapy, tear. But on the up side i can run!! so Ed took me to the buy one ticket get one free pistons game against the Rockets. So we leave at 530 for a 730 game to get the free gift for the first 10,000 there. Of course we dont get there till 730 cuz dumbass made a wrong turn and we were driven round pontiac for an hour. But we only missed 1 min of the game which was pretty sweet. But we got these nose bleed seats by all the colored folk and some drunk guy called me a boy, despite my boobs, lip gloss and pony tail.The Rockets got Yau Ming a 7 ft tall asian, and so there were a ton of lil asians runnin round the palace with there kung fu ,and the signs with there ching chong language, its was some made crazyness...damn asians. so anyway the pistons are up 20 with 10 min to go in the 4th and the crowd starts chanting "" we want darko we want darko"" then it dies down,  1 min later ""darko darko darko!"" The fans love darko! i thought i was his only fan, so sitting there in my milicic jersey i gladly joined in. Finally with like 6 min left larry puts darko in, and the crowd goes wild!!  After a few times up and down the court he was breathin hard as hell, but the big man came through and pulled off 2 dunks, a finger roll and i believe 4 rebounds maybe 5. I was so stoked! i love darko so much, i swear im gonna marry him some day, even if he has some crazy hair now.  well now that prolly none of u gave a shit about that and i wasted ure time....lets talk about this morning, this morning i woke up late got to school and realized i didnt have knee sox on...again, so i took off my sweatshit and saw i had no school shirt on, so i had to drive all the way back home, it sucked major ass.

well thats all i guess, work tommorow for the first time in almost 2 weeks so that should be a blast anad saturday im goin to the dls dance with kaylee!!

"event","well today was back to school. not much happend, ummm.....today Snova was tellin us about SNCC pronounced ""snick"" and i was laughin it up on the inside everytime she said it.

yesturday Ed came home from his week long trip to california. Its great to have him home again, even tho i didnt really miss him cuz he called me at least 2 times every day. Its crazy i can honestly say hes one of my best friends and its sad cuz not alot of ppl can say that bout there siblings. Me and him are so tight, hes always there for me no matter what, hes alot like a father to me also. Many people are scared of Ed because he comes off as a hardass and is quite muscular, but hes really just a silly little boy. If it wasnt for ed i wouldnt be who i am now, i would be more like matt....yea. 

I had therapy today, i think this is the last week and its sad cuz i love goin. if it wasnt for physical therapy id be goin crazy from the of exersice. Wow, u no ure a jock when u start goin through withdrawls from not running. I cant wait for track to start so i can run my ass off everyday, and do tons of sit ups, pushups,high knees, toe raises...all of it i cant wait.

on that note
be safe
be heathly

im out"

"event","well apparently havein one one these lil journels is the cool thing to do nowa days, and im pretty bored, so why not?

the new year hardly started and so much has already happened

on wednesday i went with kaylee to her aunts and babysat like 10 kids. At one point a kid asked me if i was a ""lezbo"" cuz i go to regina, i almost peed myself laughing. Then thursday morning woke up bright and early thinking,""im going to go to grand rapids for the day come home, see ben, and have a great night"" But in reality i went to grand rapids to visit my cousins which was pretty awsome i love seein them. Then at 530 jessica called me tellin me ben would be here in a hour....hmmm yea didnt get home till 900 and it was to late. i didnt get to see my whore and he wouldnt answer his phone...tear. It made me cry cuz i love that kid for some reason and now hes off to finish boot camp and only God knows if ill ever see him again. Friday i went to the mall with jessica and samantha to get some jeans and of course we see some military guys which made me a lil sad. When i came home i was asked to go ice skating, well according to my maymaw cripples arent supposed to ice skate, so instead i spent the night my couzins. 

found out im goin on a cruise next month im fuckin stoked bout that. 

my collage plans have also come to a turn around..i may be goin to grandvalley instead of oakland and livin my couzins which would be sweet as hell. but who knows for all i know i could end up like matt.


well thats all for now 
good night and good fight"

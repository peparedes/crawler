"event","Hello again journal..its been a long long time, but I've decided to write in you once again! So i'm going to start out with small steps at a time. I'll tell you about my night. i went to the greenday concert! hell yes i did! My chemical romance opened for them and i must say i'm not a fan.  I was amazed at all the little 12 year olds running around.  you know the type, the ones who you know are 12 but want to be 16. Then there are the 16 year olds that want to be 18 and on down the line.  It was crazy.  Plus everybody was wearing green. Just because they are GREENday doesn't mean you must wear green...sigh.  Oh well, anyways greenday def. kicked ass and we had awesome seats! It was a great concert.  

Oh man but i just remembered something i have to reenact to you. Okay imagine this.  My roommate ashley and i take out the garbage..not an unordinary routine (well it is,but just go along with it).  So we walk inside and i'm like man i can still smell that it reekes! Then i look on the floor and am like wtf is that?! so ashley sticks her face in it and guess what it is? Dog shit! Heck yes it was. Our complex doesn't allow dogs, but the people above us have an ugly big one anyways.  So anyways becky and i are cracking up b/c she is about to barf when she discovers its on her new sandal. Being ashley she tries to move faster with the foot without poo on it and falls over.  I was peeing my pants it was so funny, i didn't even care if she was hurt or not.  We def. made her clean it up to w/ these whipes and she was gagging the entire time and becky and i were just laughing....so maybe it doesn't sound that funny but if you saw it you would piss your pants too. 

So the moral of this story is watch where you walk and go see greenday!!!"

"event","Hola Journal! Como Estas? Me? I'm not doing too shabby! 
I went to the dentist today and they told me I had awesome teeth,but that I have to go see an oral surgen :(...not cool. I don't have time to come back for a consultation and then to get my wisdom teeth pulled! I'm going to have to have the momster get a referral to a good one in Tampa b/c this semester is going to be hectic enough! So I don't know what I'm going to do about that. It kinda sucks that I have to get them pulled,but its better than them messing up my whole mouth. I haven't had braces yet and I don't want them because of these four damn teeth. So we'll see...

Lets see what else did I do today? Oh I went and said goodbye to Mrs. Cora and talked to her for awhile.  Then I went to lunch with my daddy at Woody's. It was alright. They don't have too great of a selection for vegetarians,but I guess that should be expected from a barbaque joint...Oh well. 

Oh Guess what I did! I washed my car (CARSON), armor-alled him, windexed his windows, armor-alled again b/c the windex messed up the nice shininess and then tonight I totally cleaned out his insides w/ Christa's car vac! He is so nice and so clean clean! It's amazing! 

But enough about Carson, I went out to dinner with Christa and Nikki since Christa is leaving tomorrow am and I don't know when we'll be seeing eachother again....maybe if her lazy ass would come hang out in Tampa since she doesn't like anybody at UCF anyways lol(yes you are reading this so listen to it!) We ate at an italian resturant that I cant remember the name of right this second..oh wait its Santiones or whatever. It was good I had eggplant parmagana yummy!! Then we ended up back at super target! We got Starbucks there ( I do love my mocha frap lites!!) Nikki went crazy over some dishware that was on clearance so she bought it and some other things. 

I have managed to totally corrupt Christa over this break and its GREAT!!  She is now addicted to Starbucks. I took her for her first time about a week ago and we go every day now lol. I got her to buy a pointy pair of heels that she loves now...hmm OH I got her addicted to thongs too lol! She used to be anti thong and tonight she said and I quote ""I wear them [thongs]  all the time now!"" Its so great! She is like my prodigy! lol jk, but its fun!

Well okay. Now I'm going to go now b/c there is really nothing else to tell you except that I'm going back to Tampa Sat. AM!!! yay! oh and my apartment is awesome!
Adios!"

"event","So today journal I was semi-productive...
I woke up at 8 am to get ready for St. Augie,but recieved a beepidy beep from Christ-Dizzle telling me that Nikki has strep and we arn't going. So I pretty much rolled back into bed and slept till 2 pm. Not good.

Now feeling like a lazy bum I roll back out of bed and take a shower and then cook some of my Boca Lasagna...you see my dear journal I am now a Vegetarian. I do eat seafood though. This has gone on awhile,but it occured to me you didn't know so I figured I would tell you now.

Anyways. I took my sweet time getting ready and then met my mom at Target around 4 ish to get the last of the stuff for my apartment and then from there I met my dear daddy at the storage unit to get all of my stuff to take down with me tomorrow.

So now I drive to Christa's house and get in her car and go to the mall to approve a skirt for Nikki. We liked the black one and I bought 2 tank tops for like 4 bucks! hell yeah! Then we went to super Target and walked around and Christa bought a pair of rockin high heels...well short high heels. I was muy pissed b/c I wanted two pairs of shoes, but they didn't have them in my size :(...so we drive to our target to look for them. Guess what!? they had both of them just waiting for me! Hell yeah!!! So now I have two new tank tops...plus the three i got my mom to buy today, and two new pair of awesome high heels!! I'm so psyched!! 

But now I'm going to leave you b/c I'm waking up at the butt crack of dawn to drive to Tampizzle to take the first load of stuff for my apartment. Christa is going with me,but only after I bribed her with Moe's and Starbucks on me! What a blood hound lol jk!!
Ok so night night and all that good stuff!!"

"event","Journal I owe you yet another apology for neglecting you. I'm sorry, you'd think that with me being so bored at home that I could write in you once and awhile, but I guess not. There really hasn't been too much interesting stuff till now to write about to you. 

Now that I am done graveling let me fill you in on what has been happening in my life.  Let me see where I left off... Oh wow..before break..gosh that was a long time ago.  Well okay this is going to be a long entry but here it goes...
I did make it home saftely with all my stuff from moving. I pretty much slept for a week strait and then woke up to a call one day from Patey Poo telling me that I was going to go to Disney with her for the weekend. Well of course I was like Fuck Yeah!, but then I remembered that Raleigh's mom's wedding was on Saturday. I felt really bad, but what would you do...Raleigh or Disney?? Duh...I called Raleigh and told him sorry,but I was conned into it...it was my Christmas Present. yadda yadda yadda and voila I was packing for Disney!

So of course journal I was sooo excited to be going to Disney for the weekend..I was quite giddy actually, but before the fun could begin I had a duty to go see Carrie Green and everybody at Raleigh's house. So...I arrive say my hellos and then everybody decides they want to play some hipaloza or whatever. This is when I first realized how much I missed Tampa. I mean nobody there would be doing that except when there was nothing better to do. Anyways to make a long night short I realized how I would never under any circumstances hang out with these people except out of duty. Now I know that makes me sound like a shallow bitch,but I'm sorry a girl has to have standards.  

You can imagine how relieved to get out of there and go to sleep to wake up to leave for Disney.  Let me just tell you dear journal..I love the Pates. I really do they are my favorite second family..then comes Mac's.  Anyways it was the Parental Pates, the Offspring Pates and then Jessica Ryan and me. So we drive about 2 hours south and then I am in heaven...well Disney! We went to Epcot the first day and let me tell you...oh man were the guys in Amsterdam, France and Moracco hot as hell. I seriously want to take trips around the world now for real to see what fine specimans it holds...oh and the beautiful secenery and stuff ;)!  Anyways..we spent the next 3 days going through all the parks and ended with Discovery Quest. Let me tell you now that I have a new favorite place. I mean really, that place is awesome! We white water rafted, were the Pirates of the Caribbean, Shot Buzz Lightyear Balls at other cars and built a level five rollar costar.  Wow and was I dumb. We took our costar card to the attendant and was about to go into the simulator when the guy asked if we had anything in our pockets. Of course I had my cell phone and some chap stick,but I sad and I quote..""no"". So we go on our ride that had about 50 upside down turns and what happens? my cell falls out of my pocket. Yes it really did.  All you could hear is it rolling around and making crazy noises and all I could think is that its going to be in a gazillion pieces. Thank baby Jesus that when the ride was over only the caller id on the outside didn't work and this happened once before when I dropped my phone into a pool :(...
All in all my Disney weekend was awesome!

Okay so now its Christmas and I get oh so much, yet it never seems enough when it comes time to spend it,but whatever.  Christa is back so I hang out with her and here about all the fun, but mushy (since I dont have a boy) cuteness that went on between her and Brenty Boo.  It was cute, but sad for me :(
Speaking of Christa she cut all her hair off. It looks really good! 

So now I will bring on the most interesting night so far of my break. New Years Eve! Okay so I drive to Augie Dogie (St. Augie) and meet Mac at her apartment.  From here we go and see her boyfriend at work.  His name is Brenden and he is 23 and I'm not quite sure if I like him or not yet. He has a ginormous gap between his two front teeth and his voice is a little funny. Also, he is always petting/scratching Mac. under her chin and this is meant to be endearing since he is saying in his girly..no thats not it...his weird voice ""shes the prettiest girl in the whole wide world""..barf. I love you Mac,but I donno. Another thing...I was impressed because she said he drove a Jag. So I'm all hyped to go for a ride in his car...oh no its an old Jag. Its in okay condition,but its one of the years that they were made and looked like a volvo. Not cool,my bubble was def. busted :(
So after this saddening meeting at CVS..Brenden is the manager there...we hed out to St. George St. since I haven't been there in awhile and was hoping to maybe find something cool for the new apartment.  Anyways we walk the streets for awhile and I buy a shell and a cool pair of earrings and we leave. 
It is now we hed back to her apartment to shower and change for dinner and party with her friends. We end up at a small Italian resturant that was really nice. In nice I mean we wore heals and looked presentable.  So again I am disappointed b/c I've heard of how cute her surfer friends are,but agian I am wrong.  This makes me sad. Let me give you names of people. There was me, Mac, Foder(girl), Sarah, Sarah's brother who was actually really cute,but weird as hell, Magnum who was a short little guy, Scott, two weird girls and their even weirder dates, Anus (His last name is Enos but they call him Anus) and thats it.  We all eat dinner, I didn't do too much talking as I felt out of place. Everybody was really cool though. 

After dinner they all decided to go to a bar for an hour before heading back to Scott's house and since I could get in there Mac and I decided to go to Brenden's house and meet them at Scott's later. So we get to his apartment and I'm immediately attacked by his little chiwawa. Brenden and his best friend Jason are there and wasted off their asses. They offered us some drinks,but all he had was nasty ass natty's. I seriously hate that stuff. It is then that he discovers that he has ""HOrn Dog"" so Mac and I decide to try it.  Let me just tell you. Never Ever try this drink! It tasted like sour soy sauce...puke!
Anyways I was more than relieved when Scott called and said they were back at his house. So we hed over there and I am welcomed with a frosty glass full of beer. yummy! I proceed to get feeling nice off of more glasses filled from the kegerator and some very good champagne while waiting for th ball to drop. Finally the countdown begins and alas I have nobody to kiss....oh well Foder and I kicked ass at pong so I was happy. It was durning the pong game, it may have been the alchocol thinking,but I realized Anus was pretty cute. Of course as soon as I start talking to him we..well Mac and the boys decide to leave. 

Now I find myself riding in an old Camero that Jason is driving back to Mac's apartment. Now before I even took a single sip of alcohol I had decided that Jason was pretty darn cute,but didn't think too much of it. I vaguely remember haveing some important topic about his perhaps ex gf of 5 years. I'm not too sure about that ex part or not and that is why I feel bad now. You see we got back to the apartment. MAc and Brenden had her bed occupied, I had her roommates and Jason had the pull out couch bed. Well I decided I wanted to watch Napelon Dynamite since I haven't seen it. This didn't work out to well b/c it seems when I'm drunk I def. have ADD or something. So I was basically half listening and not watching or watching and not hearing a thing which sucks b/c I still want to see that damn movie. It was probably at about half way through that Mac and Brenden headed to bed and I was left there with Jason. I had just closed my eyes to go to sleep when he started playing with my had...I was like WTF,but didn't complain. Well then my hand turned into my leg and the next thing I knew was that I was getting my New Years Kiss at 3 am....I wasn't about to complain..except he wasn't a great kisser,but thats all right. So anyways I end up hookign up with this Jason character. It is never a good idea to hook up with your best friends boyfriends bestfriend. Weird for all, but I did. I pretty much got up and said good bye though and went to my own bed to sleep for the night. I woke up in the am feeling dumb b/c I dont remember if his ex is really an ex or not and if not that makes me a homewrecker,but oh well I'm not too worried about it...it was fun lol!

Oh man! I forgot to mention the worst part of my break as of yet. So Pate and I were hanging out one night and were bored out of our minds just driving around to find something to do that we got so desperate as to call Panda. This turned out to be a good call though as it led to free alcy back at her apartment in yes, nasty Palaka. Well who am I to pass up free stuff even if its from a nasty hoebag? So we follow her out there and we figure out its just us three girls and these three weird boys I have never met in my life. Not only do they smoke the reefer which is not such a big deal to me anymore,but they do cocaine lines right on her kitchen bar! Wow...what great people she hangs out with. Oh and Pate and I were looking at her pictures on her wall and were sitting on her bed to do so when we hear somthing buzzing.  Pate lifts up a pillow to uncover a blue dildo! EWWWW WTF! Worst part is she def. touched it. BARF!! How fucking sick is that! Panda says its her roommates,but wtf whould it be doing on your bed you dirty desparate whore! yuck...excuse me while I go toss my cookies...



Okay I'm back now and thats all I'm going to say about that night except to state the fact that we left as soon as they guys started talking about which peice of ass they were getting....or not losers!

So that brings us to today journal my love. I'm almost finished shopping for my apartment...seriously only like two more minor things need to be bought now...what a relief. I am driving down on Wed. with Christa to move all the stuff of mine that I can get in my mom's car. I'll spend the day putting stuff in place and making it pretty since my daddy wont like waiting for me to do that on Sat. when I move back for real...
Tomorrow I am waking up to go Donna's in St. Augie to find Nikki a prom dress. Yes she is still with Robert so she gets one last shindig....She will marry that boy and he is lucky b/c otherwise his babies would be ugly if not for her. God Bless that woman! lol!!
Well it is now that I part you with such sweet sorrow...not really my wrists really hurt from all this damn typing.
You better be happy about this entry. It took me forever. 
Well I will be writing in you more frequently to avoid this kind of stuff, but I am going to say Ta Ta for now!
Bye!"

"event","Hola Journal of mine!
today has been one of the longest days...i woke up at noon and took a shower and started to finish packing. All day was spent packing and loading my car up to the brim. My mom was sposed to be coming tomorrow am to load her car, but i decided that i didn't want her to do that b/c i hate having people follow me on the interstate. so i fit all of my stuff and what i could of becky's in my car, put some of becks stuff in ashley's car and then still had to leave stuff in bill and shea's room over the break to come get when we get back. Such a hassle,but it was nice of them to loan us their room.  
So anyways, then ashley and i had to take the christmas present to the mall so it will be given to the little girl on christmas. Then we ate dinner at panera. it was muy bien!
The hectic week has finally caught up with me and i am sooooo tired. hot hockey player is trying to get me to go over to his apartment,but i am so tired that i'm going to have to pass. Sad really b/c he is soooo hot,but i'm that tired. I have to wake up early, get checked out of my room and the dorms and then load a couple of more things and then i'm on my way.
Ash and i are getting bagles in the am and then heading our separte ways for the break and then its three hours north and i'll be home! yay!
But okay i'm going to go sleep now! 
Goodnight!"

"event","Journal I have a joke for you...so i got back to my dorm today and there was a bunch of snew everywhere..(now you say whats snew???)..Nothing, whats new with you?
Hahaha!! laugh, you know you loved that one! compliments of my daddy!!

Ok so moving on...why was my psychology exam admitted into the hospital today?...B/c i kicked its ass thats why! Okay well that wasn't very funny, but i did! My exam was at 10:30 and i was finished by about 10:55. I wam, bammed, thank you ma'amed that biotch! Yes, it was good too ;)

So yay! i'm finished with my first semester of college. Crazy actually. The semester flew by crazy fast. Shea left today :( It was very sad. The entire gang: Kiara, Kristen, Ashley, Donna, Erica, Meagan, Gywnn, Amad, Bill, Shea, Danny and Me (Beck flew out already :( ) all did lunch in argos and then said farewell to shea. I'm gonna miss that little guy. He was quite humerous. I'm proud to say that while being here he has been able to switch from drinking smirnoff to beer, now weighs 122lbs (his all time record), and no longer bangs his head against stuff when intoxicated. (we still need to work on the humping,but i think that is just the males primitive urges taking over) Anyways...its not like he lives far away, like in nj or anything..he is only in winterhaven so i'll be seeing him. If not i'll see him in a month!

So after lunch and goodbyes, Ashley and I went out for the day/night...we went to the bank, got our parking passes changed to non-residents and then went shopping! And guess what!? We did good! there was this booth in the mall where you can sponser unfortunate children so we picked a ""santa letter"" and we are sponsering this litte 8 year old girl! We bought her a cute outfit and a book and a babydoll (everything she wanted!!) How Christmasy are we? Very, we're giving instead of taking! I feel good about myself now! Go me!

Okay, lets see what else i can tell you about? There really isn't anything too exciting that has been going on since its exam week, but oh i can tell you about how i think my suitemate Fleacia is cheating on her little muslam boy toy with this big black boy from down the hall!! Technically there is no boy toy to cheat on for her since they haven't even kissed in 5 months (i know! they've only hugged once too! how weird is that??), but the point is i think Fleacia and Philly ( the boy from down the hall) have a little somethin somthin going on! Let me tell you about philly. He is about a 300lb black man who carrys this ""sword"" around. it is a huge staff that he will attack people with. He is crazy. He used to be roommates with danny boy,but danny pissed on him one night when he was drunk(and yes he is still alive) and so he moved across the bathroom to be with his ""friend"" the hobbitt. So now i will give you back ground on this kid. He is weird. really white like freaklishy, albino white with a poof ball as hair. We call him the hobbitt b/c he can speak dwarfish and can talk like smigel from the ring...it seriously sounds just like the little freaky dude. weird. but anyways, so philly and hobbitt watch anaime porn together. its really weird and disgusting. OH and did i tell you about the other boy down the hall who was jacking off to porn in the common room of his suite? how gay is that? if you're going to do it do it in your bedroom. Fag. He has this weird girlfriend who writes him these letters that we steal and read and this one was three pages long of her thanking him for stuff...like ""thank you for clouds, puppy dogs, smiles, the sunshine, love, feet, masterbation"" I shit you not...it said masterbation. How in the hell can you thank somebody else for masterbation?? I just dont get it!
But anyways back to my story. So philly came into our suite tonight and into flea's room. They were laughing and touching and being all nasty so i wanted to throw up. So here is a warning to little muslams...watch your big black girlfriends or they may leave you for the big black boys down the hall! 
Oh man and listen to this one! you will throw up so be advised! Ok so i said they've never even kissed right? WEll shes put a condom on him! yeah she ""wanted to know how to do it right"" so she put it on him! So you can touch his little sausage,but you cant kiss him? wierd! 
God i need to get out of this suite, of these dorms!!
One more night and then i'm gone! yay!
I can't wait to go home b/c that means I'll get to come back and move into my apartment!!! yay for apartments. everyone is invited every weekend! there will be a party!
Okay, well now i'm tired so i'm going to go to sleep. Goodnight!"

"event","So journal, I've neglected you lately and I'm sorry. Now that that apology is over I am going to ask you to feel sorry for me...you see I've been studying all weekend and week and my brian hurts. Its crazy really. I never studied in highschool and look at me now. I'm sick of this having to go to class to pass tests shananagans...they suck! 

So I had a math exam on Monday...which pretty much kicked my ass! I went in there thinking I was hot stuff since I never go to that class and I have the same grade as ashley does when in fact she goes everyday. I'm sorry to say this my short, red-headed friend,but I am just a little more gifted than you in both the art of skipping and math. But anyways...thats not the point here. The point is that I walked right into BSF100 with my head held high while all these fools were studying outside and I walked out after having to guess on about 12 of them...not too good. Wouldn't it be amazing though if i somehow passed it. But sigh, that is very doubtful. In fact it is more likely that Paris Hilton's test results will come up negative for STD's.  Yes, that doubtful. 
Oh well though, I'm over it. I cant do anything, but wait for my grade!

Then today I woke up and drove to my Crime and Justice Exam which I actually studied for.  You see journal this is my cake class. The professor is awesome: a portly older man who cracks raunchy jokes and only gets dressed up when he has to.  This class is made up of guest lecturers of all sorts. We've had a DEA agent, professional bar-tender, numerous police officers of different rankings and offices, lawyers, court officials, even a convicted convict who was aquitted. Yes, this is the best class ever as you can tell. Dr. Agresti even gave us up to 30 extra credit options throughout the semester.  He is awesome! But anyways..back to the exam. I've never opened the book for either of the two previous tests and pulled high b's, but on todays test (not even tech. an exam, just a test 3) after reading each chapter I feel like I've done my worst yet..What the hell is up with that? I do not know. My grade will be posted by noon tomorrow though so I dont have to wait long to find out the results! phew!

So now onto my final exam...The infamous psychology.  It isn't until thursday and already i've begun studying...crazy huh? I know everything that will be on the test so i just need to locate it in the textbook and then study it. I'm 1/4 of the way finished. not too shabby, but i'm already sick of studying and learning about Freud and his ""kids wanting to have sex with their parents theory""... its pretty much gay and i dont know of any sickos who want to fornacate with their parents so its also wrong...AHHH

Now i am pretty much awaiting the end of thurs. I'm not heading home until Sat. AM bc my mom has to come and load up her car for a second time with mine and Becky's crap. This moving thing kinda sucks..its a lot of work, but it will be worth it. I am sitting here looking at all we have left to take out and its crazy..we have sooo much stuff! I dont even want to think about moving it all into our apartment.
Speeking of the going to be best apartment ever...Ash and I went shopping for it today! We have this Pier One Clearence Store, and yes it is as awesome as it sounds!  We got an entire collection of dinnerware for crazy cheap and its soo cute. then we got candels, a huge pot filled w/ pretty flowers for decoration, tableware...all fun stuff that is awesome..just wait you'll see!

OH journal i can't wait till Jan. I mean i want christmas and all, but i'm going to be bored outta my mind for a month at home.  Who will i hang out with? I'm kinda pissed at my Jiffany...Christa is in Ohio, Pate, but thats about it..oh then mac, but not wacker b/c she is a whore. i'm going to try to schedule another intervention when i get back sometime and i'm basically going to tell her she is a whore who is going to get pregnant with an ugly baby and an ugly boyfriend and is going nowhere in life working at outback. Wow..what a special life that will be..not. 
I think to pass my time at home i will get a job since i am pretty much broke. College life is expensive esp. since we dont buy the nasty cheap beer. ugh. 

Oh!! speaking of beer, let me fill you in on my weekend! 
So its friday night..our last real weekend before leaving..so what does any bright student do?...duh study, but we didn't do that. we partied! we went to Miguel's apartment..hes a kinda shady character. he was in Ash's english class and pretty much wanted a relationship w/ Ash when she really only wanted booty, but whatever. So he lives in Avalon Heights, a really nice complex like .1 miles across the street from the dorms, with his 3 indian roommates.  So we decide to run across Fletcher, one of the two busiest roads and alas we were not run over! If ash had been on the road we would have though...you see she almost ran over this black man...during the day. How? who knows,but she simply said i couldn't see him....in broad day light?! What did you want him to smile too?! whatever! 
So anyways..we make it across the street and knock on 3 different apartment 302's before we call and ask where the hell they are! So being stupid boys thinking we are stupid girls they come to meet us. So about five minutes later Miguel and indian number one walk up smelling like reefer...this is a no no in SC so ashley gets mighty pissy...but oh well. 
we walk into the right apartment and get introduced to mr. keg and a cup and decide to play some pong.   Becky and I challenge these two ugly boys..you know they probably suck b/c they are ugly, but we find out they play a gay way. they play 6 cup...def. not right. we play the right way and had them reformed to the traditional 10 cup by the end of the night! These people basically sucked at life though b/c they didn't know how to play kings either so we had to teach them that. 
So Courtney is mighty happy after her 3rd game of pong and a game of kings when oh no, the cops come! So the triad run into a bathroom where ashley doesn't get the concept that you have to be quiet...it was funny, but not.  So while waiting for them to leave i'm about to piss my pants so i releave myself since i'm already there and then i do the ritual washing of the hands and then somehow manage to run into the door handle on the way out when the coast was clear....so now i have this huge black bruise on my outside thigh...it hurts like a mother. 
But anyways...to make a long story short we decide to leave before more cops come (plus mr. keg was tapped) and we somehow make it back across Fletcher and into the dorms, but not until after courtney take her first outside pee on one of our lovely trees! haha
So we get up into the dorms only to find another little shindig going on and join in there. it was pretty fun. some scandelous pictures were taken of the triad so we left and passed out. All in all a good night.
But okay, this is a long ass entry. i think i have made up for myself...so i'm now going to sleep in my lonely room (becky flew out today :( )  Goodnight dear journal!
Ps. do the spin-cycle!!"

"event","So i just finished writing you,but then i just got this im from a girl across the hall...it read ""Courtney can i ask you a question...sure...why did you tell ? that you hate me?""...so i pretty much dont remember this because it is likely that i was pretty hammered at this time, but it is also likely that i did say this.  so to you i say...GET THE FUCK OVER IT! if i dont like you i dont like you. also to this person, a lot of people dont like you. you're loud...in a jessica ryan kinda way. and just all over not a likeable person.  every time you find out somebody doens't like you you cant cry so just suck it up and get over it.  
i am so glad after the break i wont have to deal with these people again... i swear i think i'm back in highschool.  you're in college now people so please act like it! Get drunk, get screwed, skip class, you know the normal college stuff to do. pretty much just stop bitching...especially to me. alright? alright!
So with that aside i will now make shannon happy and talk more about the giganto gummed whore...yes thats right..jessica wacker. So here's what i know. we met this tron person at a party where we were told in the first place to watch out for him b/c he purposefully left his girlfriend at home to ""get his dick wet""...OK So knowing this would you even talk to him? you'd think not, but wacker dones't do much thinking..so she pretty much sucked his face all night. (cough cough whore cough cough)
sorry about that there was a bug in my throat...:) but anyways...so she likes him...as she does all guys that give her attention.  but anyways...so they start dating...by day like 3 they tell eachother they love eachother...right after 3 days..by the end of the first week they talk about children.how freakish is that? Could you imagine their kids? well they would have enormous gums. thats for sure, then they would have around a 6head..yeah 2 times the average forehead..yuck!
but okay i'm grossing myself out just thinking about this...so i'll come back to this..the movie is getting good!"

so i pretty much woke up around 8:30 and went and took my math test...we'll see how that one goes. then i returned to my crappy little hole in the wall to go back to sleep for like..well a really long time until i had to get up and shower.  
so now its about 4pm and we finally got our rooms cancelled for next semester and then went and Becky signed her part of the lease and yeah...
I had a hair app. at 5:30. She pretty much took 5hours to make it look the same only shorter and crappier...i'm pretty much pissed. Oh well, there is nothing i can do about it now.  
But i'm now going to go watch dirty dancing havana nights...ooo la la!"

"event","Oh journal i'm going to fail out of college and be one of those bumbs on the side of the road that you only give money too when you feel really bad for them and you also want to make yourself feel better.  this is not good.  Let me catch up up on these last two days/nights.
So, the time is yesterday (Monday). On this day we have happy Courtney. She has just signed her lease for her new apartment with Becky and Ashley! It is awesome! fully furnished, I get my own bedroom and only have to share a bathroom with one other person, I get my own bathtub!! You know... to take baths in!! yay! And i have awesome roommates! Think about it what is bad about this deal?
1. i get to get out of these hella gross dorms.
2. get away from my crazy, racist suitemates
3. get my own bedroom
4. Bathtub!!
5. Parties anytime we want
6. Big Bed! 
-all this and i'm only paying 5 dollars more than the dorms!! how awesome is  that? why in the world would my daddy say no?
So i call the parentals and run this by them...they agree and love the idea! how rad is thsat? very if i do say so myself!
So i go to work and am still estatic about this awesome day and my new apartment as of january when i come across an email from no other than shannon p.  She tells me she wants this journal-o-mine to include more juicy details from the last entry...so shannon here you go.
-I referred to Crystal and jessica as whores and i need to amend this..what i meant to say is they are dirty nasty hoebags...in a bad way...
you see, crystal has just always been a little raunchy, but now that she is getting booty from this boo of hers she is very openly raunchy and with him..and let me tell you a little about him. he is how do i say this nicely....umm gross. gotee, large and not in charge. why yes, our crystal wears the pants in the relationship and i do believe they are the same size he wears.  she has grown since i've last seen her. 
then there is her leader...the infamous jessica ryan.  you know i hate talking bad about people, but if i didn't this wouldn't be a very good entry. so here it goes.  i used to like little jessica, but at the beginning of my senior year about around the time she started dating spencer we had our outs...you see at one point she thought that i liked ""her man"", but of course i didn't. come on now. he is like 2 foot 4 and i'm a good 5'9 easy.  that would just be wacky.  i think not. then after this i hear from christa and nikki of how she cons him into buying her crap b/c he has the money. that is crap. way to be a material girl at her worst. that really pisses me off, but if the guy is stupid enough to keep with it whatever that is their business...so anyways i hear then that she cheates on this boy with an ex boy.  not cool...cheating is low shit to pull.  so jessica and spence break up, but she does make him the promise not to have sex with anybody else. ok. first mistake. dont promise not to woohoo b/c once you've done it you're going to want to do it again.  Moral of this story is i guess i just dont like her. she's loud in an unorigionally loud kind of way. as if shes only loud to seem like one of those cool loud people who just naturally have the loud thing going for them, but she in fact doesn't, but whatever she is just a dirty whore and needs to accept that. 

ok so now with that over with let me move on  to my day today.   all i can say is ahhhhhhhh! it is 2:36 am and i am still pissed. 
so it starts with me beck and ash going to cancel our housing contracts to move off next semester.  well the website said it was only 100 dollars, but no we come to find out we have to buy it out half, so its 800 dollars. no i'm not fucking with you, its really 800. So mom and dad are pissed, but we figure we're still saving money by not paying the 1500 dollar meal plan.  so whatever.
now its almost 5pm and thats when i'm sposed to be at work, but i have a math exam that i have to get a b on in the am so i tried to call in.  but no this doesn't work. my boss doesn't answer or return phone calls because he is queer...fag. so i am stuck going onto work and barely getting any studying done.  not cool. so from 10-now i've been trying to learn this math shit so i dont fail this class and lose my bright futures and basically suck at life. it hasn't gone too well. 
Now i'm pissed b/c i finally came to get some sleep b/4 my death at 9am but no, i hear my big black suitemate/neighbor fleacia attempting to sing while doing some homework in the common room...it is horrible. she really needs to give it up. she keeps going between reading out loud(since thats all she knows how to do) and singing...well more like wailing.  its horrible really.  this girl drives me nuts.  the other day i walked in to her in her same tiger oversized sleeping shirt with her walmart bag covering her weave sitting on her bed w/ her muhammad (who weighs like 100 to her 300lbs) laying w/ his head in her lap...i pretty much barfed right there.  i dont get them. they've only every HUGGED. but shes secretly in love w/ him and wants to have his little osamaha...whatever.  this from a girl who used to play 'hide and go get""...yikes
so i can also hear her roommate kristen through the wall with what i think is her boy matt. she is doing her high-pitched, loud, obnoxious laugh that is used to get attention..annoying as hell. oops something just fell. these beds arn't really made for rough sex hun ..remind me to tell her that later...so she is basically cool,but not at this hour. she is now on my shit list for awhile..or until i i get out of this bitchy mood. 
i've really been a bitch all day to almost everybody. Bill was trying to help me with math and i was being a bitch to him, but in a nice way. this kid is so pussy whipped by a girl he is supposededly not dating.  whatever. she is an ugly, nasty smoking whore. she is like a wanna be hardcore, i dont care kinda girl, but she is pretty much just a bitch.  a raunchy bitch. 
so okay becky is back now and just listened to me bitch further. so now i'm going to tell the both of them to shut the fuck up and try to get some sleep...before i die tomorrow.
-ps if you see me on the side of the road please give change. you really will feel better about yourself!"

"event","Okay, something happened and i already typed out my entire night and then my compter freaked out. So i'm going to re-type this in summary form.  So my day was sposed to start with me shopping in the early am...that didn't happen so i was woken up by my daddy at 9am to take my car into the shop. i met him there and returned home to sleep another 3 hrs.  then i was again woken up to go pick my car back up. about 2 mins after driving away from the shop my check engine light turned back on..so i have to take time out of tomorrow to turn it in to get ""fixed"" again...
I went to starbucks with raleigh...well met him up there. i bought my own coffee before he got there so he couldn't and it couldn't be considered a date. He was upset..oh well...So while he was buying his coffee Brooke runs in with about 5 minons and gives me a hug and starts talking to me. I was asked several questions about college ""how are the guys, parties, etc."" and then we moved on to the dumb slut..in other words Jessica Wacker.  we discussed this for awhile and i could tell raleigh was upset that our 'catching up time' was disturbed, but alas brooke and her followers left and we were left alone.  we told eachother what was going on in eachothers lives and chatted for quite awhile until i had to meet up w/ my dad to go meet up with my mom and the helds at moes for dinner.  I had an awesome art vandaly only to have to leave and go to nikki's party.
it was nice. the whore jessica ryan was there and so was crystal.  Nasty ass panda was there looking extremely gross, so in other words christa was my only ally.  We laughed at the two whores and were equally disgusted by panda. all i can say is barf.  She has a tounge ring now..and i do believe has swollen even bigger.  I ALSO BELIEVE SHE MAY USE THAT RING TO ENTICE OTHER SOFTBALL PUSSIES TO HER. SHE MAY VERY WELL BE A LESBIAN.  I guess i couldn't blame her, if somebody was rejected as many times as she has had to be by guys i guess she has a reason to turn to the vagina, but whatever. 
now that i have reminded myself about how gross she was i'm going to wind this down and go barf again, but let me leave you with this..if you are about 50lbs over weight, wear white, caked on eyeshadow, too tight of clothes, possibly likes the vagina, and have an obsession with panda bears, please lord dont get a tounge ring.PLEASE!
-goodnight and goodbye...

"event","Happy Turkey Day journal!
Too bad I don't eat meat...damn ashley lol jk I just have no urge to.  I got crap from everybody in my family today for not eating any turkey, but oh well...
Humm so whats been going on since I last wrote you?
Well Tuesday night after I finished writing in you Becky and I went and met up with her friend Stephanie and her little boys and just drink at one of their apartments. (which are so much better than our dorms :(..Then we walked back to our room where Becky's weird friend Jill was asleep in her bed so she slep with me for the night.  So hmm I slept through my math class, decided to roll out of bed  and make the 3 hr. drive back to OP. I saw my mom, dad, aunt, hung out with pate, did dinner w/ Christa at players and then hung out w/ pate again...
Its so weird seeing everybody again. Pate looks weird...like weird older and not herself or rather the pate i know..knew. We went to her house and Raleigh called. He was at his moms house for thanksgiving and she lives right across the street from Pate so i walked over and said hi...
So..he's cut his hair so he can spike it now. He wears Express Men clothes which is hot. He doens't look like the Raleigh I knew. Its weird. So I'm going out w/ him tomorrow after waking up at the butt-crack of dawn to go shopping w/ Christa and Nikki, turning my car in to get it fixed, and doing lunch w/ the fam. We are going to Nikkis b-day party...what fun...
But now that i'm still freezing from sitting outside in the cold talking to Tiffany for 2 hrs. I'm going to crawl into my bed and get some sleep. Goodnight and all i have to say is i feel bad for all the turkeys."

"event","Hello Journal, 
Guess what I did today?...well I'll tell you. I got a second tattoo! Crazy huh? I said I wouldn't, but I did.  My roommate Beck and Ashley and I all got three little hearts tattooed around our toes...like permanent toe rings! Fun huh? We think so! I liked the fact that it was less painful than my first one, but thats just me.
I'm going home tomorrow for the first time since I moved to Tampa and I'm so psyched! I want to see my family, my kitty, little Patey Poo, Mac..everybody!

Pate, Nikki, Christa and I have all planned an ambush of Jessica Wacker. Why you ask? Well let me tell you...
1. She quit her vball team
2. She moved in with Tron (yes that is his real name: Tron Gouch the 3rd)
3. Has been cut off from her family
4. Had her new car/ cell phone/ funding revoked
5. Is just crazy!
So this is why on Wed. night that all of us are going to take her to dinner and slap some sense into her. Will it work? I doubt it, she is really stupid, but we're going to try like the awesome friends we are. I'll let you know how it turns out.

Today was Nikki's 19th b-day! yay! Happy B-day Nikki! I have no clue what to buy her...hmmm. Oh well, I have until Friday night to get her something because thats when her party is. I think I might take Raleigh w/ me there because he wants to hang out and that will allow me not to be alone with him for too long...we'll have to just wait and see what happens.

So. my roommate is pissed because in a drunken state this past Sat. night I told this boy named Dan that she wanted his Penis..oops my bad. she does though. oh well shes over it!

Oh and let me tell you about the other night. it was only like 1 or so and Beck and I were about to go to bed but wanted to sing a goodnight song first...Well we put on all the Sister act songs and sing them at the top of our lungs.  Well i guess our suitemates didn't like this...let me fill you in about them..
First we have Tiffany: my ex. roommate, a cheerleader, not too bright,but very nice.
2. Kristen: loud, artsy girl. Nice, alittle on the crazy side, but in a fun way. You would like her.
3. Becky..my new roommate. all I will say is shes from NJ..this means loud, bitchy, dirty, doesn't shower for days, weird, but cool. You would like her most...shes actually my fav. don't ask me why...:)  
Now we get to the problems...
1. Solei: obsessed with Usher and some guy that looks like bob marley who lives above us...really the best of the three
2. Fleacia: Thinks shes ghetto, loud, has really smelly, loud shits, is in love w/ a muslim who is 10x smaller then her. Masterbates while she ""thinks"" her roommate is sleeping at night...ewww
and then there was Coraliss:  All I can say here is BITCH. really everybody hates her. She thinks Becky and I are racist when in fact she is. If we don't want her to borrow something its ""because shes black"" when really we're just being stingy. we would've done it to you too. Oh well
so back to my story. we were singing oh so beautfully at the top of our lungs when we hear a beating on our door. Why who else would it be other than our RA Jada. Coraliss woke her up to come tell us to be quiet b/c she was writing a paper. It was really quite funny, but whatever. 

Well I am going to go now. I have a beer pong tournament to participate in. I'll be sure to give you the rusults later. Good night journal.

"event","just got off work about 15 minutes ago. it was a slow night so i actually got to sleep thru the night. lauren called me last night while i was at work. i havent heard from her in weeks. i keep trying to just forget about her but as soon as i get to a point where im good and not constantly thinking about where she is or what shes doing or whether she thinks about me too, she calls. she asked if i was going to davids party tonight, i told her i didnt know. i dont want to go if she will be there. i dont want to sit there all night and watch her get trashed and try and hook up with all my friends. been there, done that and it doesnt ever end pretty. 

<i>I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut 
My weakness is that I care too much 
My scars remind me that the past is real 
I tear my heart open just to feel 

Drunk and I'm feeling down 
And I just wanna be alone 
I'm pissed cause you came around 
Why don't you just go home 
Cause you channel all your pain 
And I can't help to fix myself 
Your making me insane 
All I can say is 

I tried to help you once 
A kiss will only vise 
I saw you going down 
But you never realized 
That your drowning in the water 
So I offered you my hand 
Compassions in my nature 
Tonight is our last dance

I can't help you fix yourself 
But at least I can say I tried 
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life </i>

i just happened to be listening to this and thought the lyrics were appropriate for the mood im in right now. im going back to bed."

"event","sgt wilson called and said some of the guys fucked up last night so they are stuck cleaning the whole fire station so i dont have to go until 9 this morning. i only got like 4 hours of sleep last night but i cant go back to sleep now. hopefully today will be slow and since we wont have to clean anything ill be able to crash out in the rec room.
sometimes i wish i had a different job. one where i only worked monday to friday instead of 24 on 24 off but ive wanted to be a fireman since i was a kid so i guess ill just have to deal with it. i just hate missing out of shit on the weekends cause i have to be up early the next morning.
im floating the comal tomorrow with some friends. ill post pictures when we get back."

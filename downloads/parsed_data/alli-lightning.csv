"event","Oh, I feel so much better.
I had a friend from America called Dani, and she hasn't e-mailed me for over four months, but I just heard from her!!!

I'm so relieved that she's okay, becuase I was so worried about her. I'm just so happy.

If she ever ends up reading this: Dani, I'm so glad you're all right, and I'm glad I've got a friend like you. You're a wonderful person and I think that I could always learn loads from you. Thankyou for everything, and helping me with my problems, I'm sorry for unloading everything onto you. You seriously helped me out of that spot, becuase I would have had so much more trouble without knowing that someone, even someone on the other side of the world, cared that much about me to tell me I'd be fine.

Thankyou so much, Dani. I owe you everything.

"event","It's terrible that I haven't updated for a while....

I can just blame it on the fact that I was busy. >.< 
I actually don't have too much to comment on... I guess I have no social life whatsoever...
Although, I do have something. One of my best friends Siobhan has just told me she's going to Brighton next year, for the music program. She's so ecstatic, and I'm pretty happy for her, too.
But... I guess I'm gonna miss her so much, but she'll probably be better off down there, for her whole music stuff.

Anywayz, gotta go!!

Bai bai!!"

I'm alli_lightning, or just alli for short. I'm not sure actually why I'm here, let's just say my older sister (<lj user=""ruinfea"">) put me up to this. :(

Nah, I'm having fun. Well, since this is my first entry, I'm gonna be painfully short and now go.

Bai bai!!!!!"

"event","Had a bad night last night. Had bad insomnia and felt so cold and frightened inside. Thoughts, or maybe dreams, of Furce, hell, and demons in hell were plaguing me. Every time I'd dose off, I'd see two demons laughing, plotting and stiring a caldrin. And one of them kept saying, ""Go to sleep Stink. You know you want to. C'mon now."" So I would - go to sleep. And just then, I'd be pushed by the other demon into the caldrin. And I'd plummet - to the bottom, of which there was no end. I heard Furce's voice as I fell, which comforted and excited me, and made me want to fall. But, as I was falling, I realized he wouldn't be waiting for me at the other end, and that scared and frightened me. Bad!<br /><br />I bled lots during the night too. Woke up this morning and found lovely red presents all over my bed.&nbsp; I plan to ask the doc what's up when I go in to see him on Monday. My periods have not been on the same schedule since Furce left. They used to come on the same day, like clockwork. But now they are all over the calendar. I wonder if it's because of everything that's been happening, or because it's time for my body to change?<br /><br />Felt sad today, but had an alright time. Spent it doing laundry mostly. Also watched a baseball game, movie (BeCool, which was a good show), got a writing piece ready to turn into WRAP, surfed the net, and fasted. Today is (or was) the 11th lunar day, which is good for fasting. I am supposed to fast from sunrise to sunrise, but I only made it to about 7pm. Then I started feeling weak, so I ate. But, even though I only fasted partially, I do feel <em>a ton</em> better. I'll be fasting again eleven days after the next full moon. That time, I'll try to make it from sunrise to sunrise."

"event","God! (laughing) One of my sun sign horoscopes is such a joke today! So far from real, and so far&nbsp; from the truth! Check it out:<br /><br /><font size=""2""><em>Romance blossoms for you today, stink, and commitment and/or marriage may be just over the horizon. You and your beloved may have recently reached a new understanding of each other that has bonded you more tightly than before. Don't feel silly if you spend the entire day together walking around in a romantic haze. That's perfectly acceptable - it's part of the joy of love, and could well last for a while. Make the most of it!</em></font><br /><br />Pull-eese! I feel so stressed and unsexy today, so far from pretty,&nbsp; unattractive, romantic and ""marriageable""&nbsp; it's unbelievable! My friend came last night. Found a nice&nbsp; messy flowing red present from her in my undies after the ball game. Which by the way, was good. Well, the experience of going to the ball game was good, but the ball game was not. It was a sleeper until most&nbsp; everyone in the stands, including Kate and myself, left. Then I guess, according to the paper, the Beaves ""rallied in the eighth"" and won by two. If PK was telling you the story though, she'd say they rallied in the seventh - but she lies <strike>sometimes</strike> most times for attention and dramatic effect. I've been noticing lately that she's one who prefers the spotlight - a spotlight&nbsp; that's bright and very hot. <br /><br />Spent this day trying to get my work done. Had lots on my daily <em>to do</em> list, and more waiting in the wings. I swear! I need an assistant, or we need to hire more staff.&nbsp; I have such a pile! And I know I'll just barely get it all done before another pile comes wafting in. I guess that is the nature of the social service beast in America though. Too many people, too much need, and not enough resources.<br /><br />Normally, my working would have gone pretty easy, but I was distracted. Just moody today, and really wanting to be left alone. Also, I was frustrated by having to give so much of my time to <em>my friend.&nbsp; </em>She was really a strong presence today, and messy as all hell. Every time I went to the bathroom, I had to clean up excessive amounts of blood&nbsp; - which I was hoping would stay under control. And I guess, for the most part (considering how much I bled) it did. But, I still had to do lots of toilet and floor&nbsp; cleaning and checks, and come home and change my undies and pants. My new and cute, light colored pants. Arrrg! I LOVE being a gimp girl who gets a period! Not!<br /><br />Also felt put off by some comments that were made by PK, and some conduct by DH. It has really been hard to be around her (DH)&nbsp; since she's been back. She was just a little bit of a bitch before, and this was only sometimes. But now she's really a bitch -&nbsp; rude and sour most of the time. And she has a real tendancy to monopolize conversations and droan on. She did this during a meeting today, which really tried my patience. <br /><br />As for PK, I don't think she realizes it, but she often says and does hurtful things to people she claimes are her friends,&nbsp; just by saying things to put the spotlight on herself. I'm noticing that she often paints this picture that her family is perfect. They all seem to be lucky when it comes to opportunities to take advantage of.&nbsp; A good example of that is last night at the game. I made some remark about how the t-shirts they were selling at the stadium were $25 bucks. But she said the ones she and her family managed to get were $5. I asked her were she got those, and she very easily said, ""They were tossing them around in the stands.""&nbsp; Like any idiot could have gotten one. Well you know what? Kate and I were in section N til the bottom of the 5th, and we saw no shirts - because the shirts, according to PK, weren't thrown around until the eighth. And, if it were not for her sighted husband, daughter and son, she (PK) wouldn't have gotten one. <br /><br />Kate and I talked about this and other PK incidents after we left. We decided that we often feel slighted by her because of her talk, and we concluded that, she would not be the same person if it weren't for her family. She would not have experienced the same things or had the same life that Kate and I have had. She'd struggle and be down just like us. Her family is the reason that she is not living in the ghetto, and her family is the reason&nbsp; she has so&nbsp; many opportunities and feels so much ease. I think she forgets that when she's around folks like Kate and I. She'll say, ""C'mon do it! It'll be great!"" But, doing is not that easy for people like me and Kate. The ghetto life is really hard and really a struggle. But, it really does feel great, and it is life changing to have the support of a husband and family. I know when I was with Furce, I felt higher somehow - like I was better off and had much more opportunity. I didn't feel like the same person. I felt like a person who could take advantage of opportunities that wouldn't otherwise be available to me. But I also felt like I was in an awesome position to give back - to my friends in the ghetto, and to those less fortunate. <br /><br />When I ""make it big"" one of the many things I never want to do is forget. I never want to enjoy myself so much that I forget. I always want to remember where I came from, what I went through, and who is still out there living the ghetto life - not by choice but by circumstance. I never want to make it so big that I forget - to give and help and go and see. I guess I always want to be ""friends with the ghetto life""&nbsp; just in case I make it big, but by some freak of nature, end up back there someday. I'll want the ghetto life to be good to me. <br /><br />Also, missed Furce today, much more than usual. Cried over him last night. I was sad that he wasn't at the ball game with me and Kate, but I was glad he wasn't there, because I didn't want him to see that, even though I have learned a lot about baseball, I am still green. And, I didn't want him to see the struggle we had watching the game and getting a hot dog. But, at the same time, I wanted him to be there for that too.<br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","This day was alright, but hard and tough. Skipped the weekly checkin and case review in favor of going to a meeting with the county commissioner for my district, and the speaker of the state house. This was on behalf of the DSAC. BQ told me he would make it to this meeting, but never showed. I wonder why? I'll guess that he asked for permission from our DSAC staff person, and was told ""no"". Which made me feel good, because I don't think he needed to be at that meeting, even if it was ""just to see what the concerns were in east county"". Lately, I've been feeling like he's been trying to inch his way into business that ILR staff is involved in, but isn't really any of his concern. He's trying to get me to step down as chair of the DSAC because of ""some new changes in ILR policy"" that he'd like to implement in regard to staff serving on community boards. He&nbsp; mostly just wants&nbsp; me to have my time free so&nbsp; I can spend it serving more consumers. He also doesn't want their to be any conflicts of interests between staff and the piece of shit we've got for chairman of the board, Mr. W. He's got no job, and serves on every damn advocay committee in this town. God forbid we should have an ILR staff member be in a position of authority over him on one of the committees he serves. <br /><br />I'm thinking now that, although BQ has a good leadership style, he might be a big shot with an ego. I think he's thinking that, just because he's interum E.D. and supervises the staff, he can control what they do out in the community. But, I'm thinking that he's finding he can't do that - and I think he's getting his hand slapped and his nose biffed lots. Now I think I'm getting what SW meant when she said ""They don't have a clue."" and ""They won't get it"". I think we'll end up going to hell in a hand basket here before too long. <br /><br />Was going to crash, but I think I'll make a good meal and watch a movie tonight. The moon is one quarter full, it will be in&nbsp; Cancer around 8pm, and a top ranking official at the federal DHS was busted for ""chatting about sexual things"" and ""sending picturesto"" a girl on the internet. Oh my God! I'm <em>so </em>not surprised.<br />"

"event","The moon is waxing, and 43% of it's visable disk is illuminated today. Also, it's the 6th lunar day,&nbsp; and Saturn is moving forward once again. Word of this comes from <a href=""http://sfyoga.net/"">The Astrologer from San Francisco</a>, and word about the moon comes from <a href=""http://aa.usno.navy.mil/"">The US Naval Observatory, Department of Astronomical Applications and Data Services</a>. <br /><br />Alrighty then!<br /><br />This day was? OK but stressful? Came to work tired but managed to work through and past it anyway, became involved in a stressful hullaballoo surrounding a meeting tomorrow (someone important was left out, and even though the situation was resolved, they are still not happy.) Also, got a stressful phone call, drowned my sorrows in a diet pepsi and big cookie during my lunch time with Kate and PK, went back and worked til three, then went to drown my sorrows more, and free myself at the mall. Went to <em>Just Sports</em> and <em>Sears</em>. I wanted to find and get more at <em>Just Sports</em>, but all I found that I really could live with (notice I didn't say <em>like</em>) was a gray Mariner's shirt in a size M - too big for me. Let's just hope it shrunk during it's time in the dryer. I really had my heart set on finding something San Diego Padres. Maybe I can get something at the game Thursday night. I am going to my first ball game ever. Isn't that sad - to be almost 34 years old and learning about and discovering sports for the first time? Admitting that embarrasses me. It's like saying that you're 34, and you've never read, written or had sex! Oh my God! To me, that is really sad. Sports is up there with reading and writing (and sex). It should be a fundamental part of every person's life. My sister, brother, and some of my aunts and uncles knew this, because all their kids were involved in sports. I was not. It would have taken too much time away from ""the work on the farm"" that my parents saw more fit to spend their time with. ""We're doing it for you Stink! So you can have!"" They'd say to me. Well, I hope their enjoying their new mini mansion as I sit here in my government subsidized ghetto apartment.<br /><br />You know, now that I write that, I think the thing that most gets me about the whole situation with my parents is that, I feel like I was lied to by them for so many years. And I suffered so much because of that - and not so I could have, but so someone else could - selfishly. Now, I am having to bust my ass fixing myself and fixing damage that was done to me because of other people's selfish lies! That's what makes me feel mad about it. And I am having to work so damn hard fixing! And even though I have come so far, there are people that still come along and say ""you're still not good enough."" To that I think, ""Excuse me, but do you have any idea what a cesspool I've had to crawl out of and dust myself off from?! Apparently not! I know I still have a ways to go, but I have done and am doing damn good!""<br /><br />Went to Sears for socks - some that aren't tight around my ankles. Then I went to Shaftway, and then home to clean and do laundry. Now I am here, writing and ready to go to bed.<br /><br />I see that Tom Delay resigned from the house today. He says it was ""after much prayer and contemplation"", and because of some other stupid quote I can't find at the moment. Can't wait to see him on Dateline.<br />"

I thought it was no problem. But when I came to get the entry back, nothing came up. Bummer for it, and bummer for me. I spent a long time writing that. <br /><br />Today was? I don't know - OK, alright, and not easy? I was glad I was at work, but I wished I could have been somewhere else, doing something else. Anything but that. Sort of like I am wishing for my life in general right now. I can't believe I have been alone for as long as I have. No calls or any kind of communication with my parents or other family for seven months! <em>Seven</em> months! It doesn't bother me that my parents and family haven't communicated with me - because I know their not the right people for me to be at all close to. What bothers me I guess is not feeling like I have a family to call my own, or a space to fit in a family. That is what I miss the most. Family. Even though my family is and was fucked up, and I never really had a space to call my own that fit - I miss family, just the concept of it I guess. Wish I had someone in my life who felt like a mother, father, brother, sister, etc. I think that's one of the reasons why I miss Furce so much, is because I felt like I was a part, and had a&nbsp; nice little space in his family. Wish some family I thought enough of would take me in and adopt me so to speak. Actually, I wish Furce would just come back.<br /><br />Ran errands after work today. Went to Target, the bank, the store, Old Navy, and then came home. Busted a big bottle of Pepsi as I was going in the door to Old Navy. It got caught in the door in such a way, that it busted the bottle. The miss who helped me clean the mess said it was no problem. Even so, I was still so embarrassed, and vowed never to go to Old Navy with packs of work pepsi, as I'm calling the 20 oz bottles now, ever again."

"event","Today was? Not as I expected it would be. I wanted to feel good and get lots of things done, but instead I felt bad and sad, and didn't do much at all except sit around, cry, eat, surf the net, draw and watch a lone movie.<br /><br />Woke up thinking about an email I got from JC yesterday, and missing Furce, much more than usual, as I sometimes do. He is my reason for crying twice as I did today. It's been just over eight months, and I still am missing him <em>so very much</em>! I have never loved or missed anyone in my life as much as I have loved and missed Furce. Not my parents, and not even my bestest friend blank - and blank I love a lot.<br /><br />JC. I'm sorry, J Kaayyyyyyy C (she's using her middle initial now). She has been gone from ILR for two months now, and is still finding ways to get under my skin. I feel like she always strives to get the best of me, and always succeeds, which sucks. We are both equals (well actually, truth be told, I am better than she is) but, she acts like she's better than me. ""Oh, I've worked at ILR for four years (as opposed to your two), I'm 28, I've got a Master's Degree,&nbsp; I'm married, I just got a new job working for VR, and I just bought a new house - a quaint little cape cod. And, I know how to be a bitch, I know how to be mean, and I know how to ignore, schmooze and make you look and feel like a fool."" And then she says things like,&nbsp; ""Oh, I miss you so much. Can't wait to see you, can't wait to have lunch."" Get Out! She can't stand me as much as I can't stand her, I'm sure<br /><br />It bothers me that, in an email I sent, she wouldn't even varify a simple something - whether something is true or not, with a simple yes or no. Classic ignoring. Not even a reminder to say, ""Stink, I don't have a release. I need one before I can tell you that info."" She enjoys being a bitch and getting the best of me - I swear! Even so, I'm still better than she is. I'm joking about that, but deep down, something along those lines is&nbsp; probably true. :) Things seem so perfect for her and her life on the outside, but I bet on the in, she's a wreck.<br /><br />Going to breakfast tomorrow with the happy couple, Kate and T. That will be good, as they are fun to hang out with. On the way home, I plan to stop at Old Navy and get the clothes I meant to get today. Hope I feel better then. <br /><br />Saw the movie <em>Paparazzi </em>today. No wonder there was no sticker on the DVD. It was&nbsp; a sleeper - boring and stupid as hell. It's basically about a group of people who try to kill and maime a famous guy and his family by ganging up, and taking pictures of them. Imagine the movie&nbsp; <em>Chinatown</em>, and one of the scenes where Jack Nicholson&nbsp; is walking alone. In that movie, he would be jumped, but in <em>Paparazzi</em>, they just jump out and take a picture.&nbsp; They reminded me of the guys from&nbsp; <em>Riverdance</em> - just jumping out like that. <br /><br />Whoever made the movie tried to make it cool by inserting these cheesy manufactured drama moments, having the actors talk tough, and inserting these intense, special effected flashbacks. Sorry Hollywood, despite that, the movie still sucked. Now if the photogs would have been terrorists, there were monsters coming out of the lenses, and they were buring in an earthly hell, that would have been cool! :)"

"event","Yay! Jill Carroll is alive and free! Good news, good news, good news!&nbsp; :) I <em>do</em> wonder why though. Why was she only held for just under four months and not killed? Why, why, why lord did you spare her? <em>Why</em> was it not her turn to die today, or any other day between January 7th and now? I got a call you came for LL's father around 10am this morning. She called me and said she wasn't bothered by ""his passing"" but she must have been, as she seemed scattered in the head and was talking very fast. But then again, she's always that way. But today,&nbsp; her way seemed, just a titch different somehow.<br /><br />Work today was? Satisfying. Got a slow start, had trouble waking up, and was in pain. My left ankle, hip and wrist hurt, as they often do when it's really wet out.&nbsp; But, I managed to work slowly and steadily through everything anyway. Got my indirect service and group reports done for the quarter. Yay! Now I only have six more consumers to log and I'll be done. Until next quarter. No, hopefully not. Hopefully the new database and BQ's leadership will make procrastinating on paperwork a thing of the past.<br /><br />Went to The Lucky Labrador and Roots Organic Brewing Company after work. Had a good time at both places. But, the better and more interesting time was had at Roots - which was disappointing cause I'd hoped the better time would be had at The Lucky Lab. The atmosphere there was good, and the people seemed nice enough (although I did wonder if they were sincere) but the food was disappointing. Not enough of a selection or variety - on the menu or the plate. <br /><br />Roots was about the same as The Lucky Lab for food and atmosphere. Although it was a little more grunged up with are and things. That was cool. It reminded me very much of the things I saw when I went to SMYRC or the things I was surrounded with during my days in art school.<br /><br />The interesting part about Roots was the bathrooms. Both were marked as being accessible to people with disabilities - and they were great as far as getting around went. But, there were no grab bars at all! <em>REALLY</em> odd. It's usually the other way around. My friend and I went and told the manager about this, and we were given an apology and two free meals complete with beers. So, my friend and I decided that, we would give them two weeks, go back and eat then, and see if they kept their word to us.<br /><br />Enjoyed my time on Hawthorne today. It was great to be in the company of a good and cherished friend, and it was great to be going out. I spent time with my friend and thought about how I wished I could do the same thing with Furce - walk a street like Hawthorne, take him into places I knew, and discover new places together. We did that a little bit before we broke, but not so much. It was more <em>him</em> taking me to <em>his </em>places. I got the impression that he didn't like many of my places anyway. But, I think that was just because he made the choice to be sour and resistant toward them. I love the fact that he often prided himself on ""being so open minded"", But yet, looking back, his mind seemed very closed. ""If it doesn't fit into the box, it doesn't belong."" was his motto I think. I still love that man anyway. <em>So much!</em> Why, why, <em>why</em>? What the <em>HELL</em> is wrong with me?! I'm actually thinking that, despite the fact that he hasn't contacted me in any way shape or form for almost nine months, he <em>will</em> be back someday. And I will be able to take him to&nbsp; Pitman's map and globe store so that he can buy more maps to add to the collection he keeps."

It was the usual Wednesday - the check-in/case review combo meeting that <em>always</em> runs <em>way</em> over, a hurried lunch, and then WRAP. I wrote a good piece there about a small thimble of thread, a tab to a soda can, a faceplate for an old lock, and a strip of paper that reminded me of a big fortune from a big fortune cookie. Think I will shore that one up and submit it for consideration to be published in the anthology.<br /><br />My patience has been thin with my co-workers lately. It was today.&nbsp; I felt <em>so pissed off</em> that I had to sit in a meeting for two and a half hours and couldn't be at my desk working.&nbsp; I have to have all my paperwork in for the quarter by Friday, and I still have so much of that to do. And I also have casework on top of that - and a letter and incident report to write. I swear! My job makes me feel just like I'm in college again. Too much to do, and not nearly enough time. But, on the other hand, I am so damn lucky to have my job, and even though I bitch, I feel <em>so blessed</em> to have it. <br /><br />Have been waking up lately feeling mad. I do that sometimes, and I'd like to know why. Waking up feeling mad for, what seems like no reason, has been a trait of mine ever since I can remember.<br /><br />Read the news on the way to work today. I am curious to know more about Andy Card's resignation, and why they hired this new guy Josh. Does appointing him as chief of staff mean that we will begin to focus less on Iraq and more on things at home? And will our economy get better? I don't know. But I do know that Rawanda is the most populated country in the entire continent of Africa, and it's only the size of Vermont. It holds something like 8 million people, and Vermont has six hundred thousand or something. And, the people there are competing with the mountain gorillas for water and basic survival. I know this because, in addition to the news,&nbsp; I also read <a href=""http://adventures.yahoo.com/"">The Adventures of Richard Bangs</a> on Yahoo.&nbsp; I also read the latest from <a href=""http://hotzone.yahoo.com/"">Kevin Sites</a> there too. Could you imagine just driving along in your car one day, and having a rocket propelled granade suddenly hit your windshield and rip it, and the whole front side of your vehicle off? Experiencing that once would traumatize me for life. I couldn't imagine doing it every day as many of the soldiers in this world currently are. ""It's not just an adventure, it's their job!"" She says facetiously.<br /><br />Have been drawing a lot. Doodled during the meeting today. Worked more on value and drew a face during WRAP. I am getting better at my eyes and noses, but I still need to improve on&nbsp; my mouths. If I stare at one long enough, it will become&nbsp; a part of me on the cellular level, get in my mind and then I'll have it. Once I get a mouth resolved in my mind, I'll get one resolved in my drawings. <br /><br />Most of my faces are still looking like Furce. I think I could draw him from memory blindfolded. I still trip up on&nbsp; his hairline though, and (of course) his mouth."

I did see one consumer, go to the bathroom a few times, went to get some coffee, grapes and a few glasses of water, and took a break for lunch. But other than that, I did nothing, and the day was uneventful. I have learned not to do much that involves leaving my cubicle, when TPS and some volunteers we have are there. They have ADHD and, if I even say ""hello"" they'll get to talking and will distract me - for an entire day if I let them.<br /><br />Stopped at 119th and went to Albertson's on the way home. On my way there, I was distracted by some movies I saw for sale at Blockbuster. 3 for $20.&nbsp; I got <em>Final Cut</em>, <em>Papparazzi</em>, and <em>Be Cool</em>. <br /><br />Went to Albertson's, spent $44, and got vegetables, fruit, milk, cheese, meat,&nbsp; tortilla&nbsp; chips and a slice of cake. When I got home, it was my minds intention to binge.&nbsp; But thank God, my stomach didn't feel the same. I only ate a comfortable bit. I have been thinking about binge eating like I used to when I was fat, all week though. That kind of worries me, as I haven't had thoughts like that in a long while.<br /><br />Have been here looking up sites that will teach me vedic astrology. I'm feeling inspired to learn it now because of the astrologer from San Francisco. He does vedic readings and his forcasts are so right on! I'm hoping things begin to feel better after this eclipse that is set to happen tomorrow. We will not see it here in the US, but people living in Africa and Turkey will. And, my <a href=""http://www.ofesite.com/spirit/horoscop/moonsign/moonform.htm"">moon sign</a> is Leo. <br /><br />Didn't get very far in my reading of the news this morning, as some yahoo on the bus that I couldn't understand, kept bothering me. But, I did read <a href=""http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1143518142253210.xml&amp;coll=7"">this bit</a> about some guy who tried to put his hat in the ring for the governor's race, by paying with gold and silver coins. I guess the main thrust of his platform was to get Oregon back to the gold and silver standards, as next to saving the salmon, paying in that way, is the only way to fly I guess. <br /><br /><img align=""left"" src=""http://images.coolhouseplans.com/chp/saa01/b2071-951-637-cr-saa/thn.jpg"" alt="""" />Did some research about, what I came to find, are cottage homes last night. That is the kind of home Furce and I dreamed of having for our own respective reasons (although we didn't know it). Found this cute one that I am hearby putting in my dream about Furce and I, from now on. My favorite part is the swooshy roofline, and Furce's favorite would be the fake wood beams.<br />"

"event","My spirit had hoped this day would be <em>glorious</em> and&nbsp; <em>spectacular</em>! My spirit had hoped that this would&nbsp; be the day that things that seem to have been sitting stagnate and spinning in a rut for so long, would <em>finally</em> start to move forward again. Sadly, this was not the case. For the most part, this day was just like all the others I have had for the last, I don't know how long.&nbsp; Except for the sun, and lunch with MS at the River City Grill, this day was relatively inauspicious again. Damn!<br /><br />Went to work for a little while before going to lunch with MS, then to a DSAC meeting. I realized yesterday that the reason I have been so aloof and dispondant at work lately is because I'm missing my passion (art and graphic design) and grieving. Drawing and creating art <em>really</em> ignites the fire that is my soul. For me, deciding on a typeface and it's color and placement on a page is much more exciting and rewarding than helping someone just get through their daily life - over and over and over again. I mean, helping someone get through their daily life is alright, but it's not as rewarding to me as creating a piece of art is. Have been thinking lately and yerning to get back into it. But, I have lost all my connections, I know nothing about the current industry, I don't have any real experience, I'm still not that good, and I don't feel like I'm ready. The water still looks like it feels too cold, I don't exactly have the time, and even though I love art, I'm not sure if I want to take it on full time!<br /><br />I worked, thought about all these things, continued to miss, and composed the next consumer narritive in my head.&nbsp; ""Called to get so and so on list for energy assistance again today"" and ""signed so and so up for art class"" etc, etc. Blah, blah, blah, boring.<br /><br />Lunch with MS at the River City Grill was good. Wish we could do it more often. I enjoyed the company, the conversation and the food. I was worried about the food at first, because there was nothing on the menu that was the usual standby so to speak. And if there was the usual standby, it was dressed funky - like a bleu cheese burger with chives instead of just a cheeseburger. Seeing this (and the servers in fancy atire) scared me.But, I tried something I never at before, and it was really good. Chicken and lemon grass soup, and&nbsp; lemon grass pasta with shrimp&nbsp; and other fish, in a coconut cream cheese sauce. <em>Very</em> good. Just enough of a portion and not too overdone. But, my pasta alone was $14! The view was awesome though. And, on the way out, MS and I saw a bottle of wine that belongs to Lars Larson. Apparently, he has a stash there.<br /><br />Went to the DSAC meeting after. The meeting was alright, but it didn't go as I'd have liked. We were way behind of time, and people kept going off on tangents that weren't in any way related to the discussion. This made me mad.<br /><br />Got a gringo burrito, then caught the bus home. I rode the bus for something different,&nbsp; and to avoid old man L and the white trash that frequent the MAX between 10am and 5pm on the weekdays. Enjoyed the bus ride. Going through the neighborhoods as we did,&nbsp; rekindled my desire to live there someday - with Furce, in&nbsp; the Woodstock neighborhood, in a really cool fusion of a German and Cottage style house."

"event","<div align=""left"">The astrologer from San Francisco said&nbsp; that today would be the 13th lunar day, and it would be a dark day for the moon. Therefore, I (and others too) would feel weak and drained. But, mercury is moving forward now, so our minds should be clearer. Well, I don't know about the clarity of mind, as mine still feels like mush. But I do know that my day was an exact duplicate of yesterday, but worse, until around 2pm - <em>after </em>I resolved to do absolutely nothing but sleep, and after I drank a cold, crisp and delightfully refreshing, pepsi.&nbsp; <br /><br />I resolved at that point to get my ass up, get moving, do the laundry, clean the house, and get myself and my stuff ready for the week. I did. And I drew some and listen to ""podcast #31 of Blast the Right"". It's the one where Jack talks about how the people working at ground zero of The World Trade Center didn't have any protective gear. And now they are becoming sick with all these diseases 'n' stuff. It made me think of M, a boyfriend I once had.&nbsp; He got sick and became disabled from a spinal virus thingy. He thought it was from drudging ships in Connecticut with no gear. I bet you that's it, but who knows.<br /><br />Came here to mess around on the computer after drawing a pretty good flower with a man's face in it. I see that I am indeed getting better now, despite what I'd like to think. I think the best way to do it, is to think in terms of spots of value mostly, and a little about shape. But, if you think in terms of ""I want to draw a lady in this kind of way, and in this kind of shape"", that's when you really mess up and do a crap job. <br /><br />Discovered video on demand on yahoo news as well as Kevin Sites tonight. I have been&nbsp; staring Kevin Sites in the face for months, and never looked at his stuff until today. He does storiies about regular everyday life in the middle east. For example, there was a video about Surfing in Tel Aviv, and another about life in Gaza. Pretty cool. <a href=""http://hotzone.yahoo.com/b/hotzone/20060317/hz_afghanistan_0306/blogs2962;_ylt=As14LGJLxlUMUuiViMc6k6mwEcsF;_ylu=X3oDMTBhcGtxczUxBHNlYwNoenRyaXA-"">Here</a> is a piece he did about things soldiers carry for good luck (RCB will love this). My favorite part is the photo essay. <br /><br />By the way, I think Furce would be really good at doing the same kind of thing Kevin Sites is doing. He did go to Journalism school, he did study film, and, despite the anger he is feeling,&nbsp; he has one of the most awesome and caring hearts I've ever had the privilege to be in the presence of and loved by.</div>"

"event","Had big plans for this day, but it ended up being much more inauspicious than I'd hoped for. Planned to watch a baseball game then go out - for a walk, to the bank and for a meal. But ended up staying in bed for most of the time, sick, in pain and sleeping. I did watch the game though. I guess the Cubs beat the A's by one. I watched until the end of the 5th - which was scoreless, then went in to take a nap. In the article I read, Dusty Baker was quoted as saying, ""It was a great game for TV"". I'm sorry - but I didn't see that. As far as I'm concerned, it was a sleeper. But it must have gotten more interesting after I left.<br /><br />The rest of the day was hard and difficult to get through. Like I said, I was sick, in pain, and just feeling down about my life - hating everything, not caring, not looking forward to,&nbsp; and missing Furce. I cried about things a couple of times.<br /><br />Got up and drew for the first time in a few months. I felt mad at myself because things still looked the same. I'm still not getting any better. As far as my brain is concerned, I won't be as good as I&nbsp; like until I get to the point where I can draw anything in any way, at the drop of a hat. <br /><br />Spent the evening listening to podcasts. Listened to this one that claimed that abuse of any sort is not as prevelant in our society as we'd like to think. Granted, it is done by a select few, but for the most part, the idea that it is so rampant is being used as a tactic to induce fear and gain control. Hmmm?<br /><br />Read a great article this a.m. about <a href=""http://apnews.excite.com/article/20060325/D8GINVHO2.html"">life in a FEMA trailer</a>. If the story is true, I think I could fit about three of those things in my apartment. And my parents could fit a whole slough of them in that mansion they're buying.<br /><br />Also read an article about <a href=""http://apnews.excite.com/article/20060325/D8GID8V80.html"">the bathtub</a> where James Earl Ray stood to shoot Martin Luther King Jr. (or Martin Luther Koon as my father calls him) being for sale on ebay.

"event","Today at work was awesome! GG, CE, BQ, MB, GM and I were the only ones that were in really. Well, TS was there too, but she was in and out. So, it was library quiet and very easy to work - which is what I did, gladly. Spent the day at my desk rocking out to tunes on the ipod, IMing, drinking pepsi, doing casework, and entering crap on the new database. I'm proud of myself because I am really getting the hang of that thing. It's becoming like old hat - second nature to me now. I like it so much better than the oldstyle, tedious paperwork.<br /><br />Came home and S came. She has this nasty habit of just unlocking my door and coming in without knocking. So, she heard me talking to myself - asking the cats if they thought I could make it to the bathroom without having an accident, and whatever other crap I said and sung to entertain them and make them smile. This was embarrassing, and also made me hip hopping hornet mad. I <font color=""#ff0000""><em><strong>really</strong></em></font> hate it when she comes into my house without knocking. It makes me feel so violated - like I've just been raped! I need to address the issue with her, and have needed to for a long time. What I really want to do is take her key away, and say something like, ""You've shown me that you can't use this key I have given you properly, so I'll have to revoke your privilege of using it from now on."" But, I feel scared and uncomfortable to say and do anything because of riffs and retaliation. I guess what I need to do is just pray for courage, wisdom and insight on this one, then go from there. <br /><br />I have a fair amount of issues with S. But, I don't deal with them and I keep her around because she does a fairly pleasant job cleaning, and I don't want to have to worry about, and go through the hassle of finding a new care provider. Sort of like the reason I stay with my bank. I hate them, but don't want to go through the hassle of changing.<br /><br />I have problems setting boundaries with S. I have a feeling that, if she knew how I really felt about a lot of things, she wouldn't want to work for me anymore.&nbsp; Only because, my setting of boundaries would take her aback and hurt her feelings so. I overlook and put up with a lot of shit that bothers me because of this. I don't want to, but I feel too scared and uncomfortable to change anything - at least for the time being.<br /><br />Sometimes I wish I could just tell S that I don't want her to work for me anymore. And other times I dream that&nbsp; I could tell her that I'm moving to Portland or getting married, and she can't be my provider anymore. I think she's got too much control over me, and this does not sit well. The cats dread her coming. They run and hide every times she's here. That's always a clue for me - if the cats are scared and hate someone, that means they shouldn't be around. I tell them ""I'm sorry"" and spend a good amount of time consoling them after each time she comes.<br /><br />Was going to stay home and do the usual before S came. But as I said, her coming in as she did made me mad - so I made the choice to go for a run to cool off. I used ""having to go take care of some business"" as my excuse - which was no lie. I went to fix my bank card and get some strawberries, grapes, mustard, crackers, chips&nbsp; and chinese food. On the way home, I resolved to confront her about at least one thing that was pressing sometime soon. then I came back, talked to her like usual, felt like I told her too much (like usual) and kicked myself for doing that. Telling her too much about my personal life is another issue I have with S. A lot of times after I tell her things, I feel very dirty - violated again. I wonder if this has anything to do with her mental illness?<br /><br />And, speaking of dirty, today I have been thinking of dastardly and dirty deeds to do to old man L or any other pervy creep who wants to ""call me"". One thing I'll do is memorize the number to a gentleman's club or strip joint, and give them that as my number. Or I'll say, ""why don't you call..."" and give them the number. And, the next time old man L asks me to go out, I've been thinking of taking him to a strip joint, getting him a lap dance, then ditching him. But, the only thing is, I'd need help making a quick exit. A very quick exit. That's one thing that sucks about being in a chair - it's not easy to&nbsp; pull those quick exit, or run and hide type pranks."

"event","Was the usual Wednesday today - busy without a break from ten until four.&nbsp; Even though it was a hard working day, I enjoyed it very much. But, I wouldn't want to work these kind of hard working days consecutively, as I know doing so would easily kill me.<br /><br />Stand outs from the day include the discussion in the morning meeting with BQ, WRAP, my urge to draw again, and my thoughts about being an artist - they are, and have been creeping back again.<br /><br />Talked about reconfiguring the spaces at ILR in the morning meeting today. The discussion we had reminded me of just how much of a Godsend BQ is to the agency. I really, really love that one of the things he is willing to do, is spend good chuncks of time and put good chuncks of energy into getting very small but significant things straightened out. One of those things includes reconfiguring workspaces, so that they function better, and better work to serve the needs of the agency, consumers and staff. Right now everything is arranged haphazard - just wherever it will fit. I think that says a lot about the agency, and how it has been functioning for several years. <br /><br />I'm excited about the new plans we're drafting for reconfiguring the spaces at ILR. I'm very much looking forward to being able to work in the quiet, and feeling at ease inside.<br /><br />Wrote some good pieces for WRAP. One was about how I used to get up early in the morning, go to the fridge and break eggs, and the other was about the biggest lie I ever told. I liked the one about breaking eggs the best. I think I'll be submitting it to the anthology.<br /><br />Also, JK shared today! Week number six, and it's the first time she has ever shared her writing with the group! Yeah! :) She would only share though, if I was next to her. That made me feel&nbsp; good, at least thinking that the mere presence of <em>me</em> could give someone the courage to share. Yes! Yes that we have made a breakthrough, and yes that she shared! :)<br /><br />The astrologer from San Francisco said that today would be a day for reflecting and assessing what we want to, or are meant to do with our lives. I have had the urge to draw again lately, and have been contemplating chucking my job as an IL counselor, and being an artist, wife, mother and homemaker. I've been thinking about having a child of my own and what I would do for her or him. I know I'd try very hard to sacrifice as much of my own life as I could, to help them walk and navigate through theirs.&nbsp; Because I know this child I would have would not be my own.&nbsp; It would be in my care at the request of God.&nbsp; That being the case, I should and would&nbsp; always work very hard to do the best I can to raise him or her to the best of my ability. And I think I'd be methodical about it.<br /><br />You know, I think that's one of the biggest mistakes people make with children (and other people) is saying and thinking ""they are mine"". When people think something is theirs, it&nbsp; gives them the impression that they can do anything they want with it - treat it as they please because it's theirs, and they don't have to answer to anyone. Actually, nothing is anyone's - everything is on loan from God, so, we shouldn't treat it as we please, cause we'll have to return it someday. And, if we think about it, do we really want to return something from God in a worse condition than we found it? I wouldn't want to.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />Old man L called tonight. He has been calling about every Wednesday since I let him have my number. Will be glad when he stops calling. He sure is a nosey fuck. And his probing, innocently as he does, makes me feel so dirty! ""What kinds of things do you write about in your Diary?"" <br /><br />""It's not a diary you fucknut! It's an online journal! There's a difference! And, what I write about is none of your GodDamn fucking pervy-assed business!"

"event","Not much to report today. Just went to work, quietly worked at my desk all day and then came home, cleaned the house, ate dinner and came here to write. I got little done that I'd planned, and a good chunck done that I didn't. MB and I are the only counselors in this week, and our main clerical support person is on vacation. So I am getting all the I &amp; R calls that are coming in. And people are asking for, not the usual run of the mill. Today it was, ""I need to obsolve my guardianship with my controlling father! Where can I go? Help!"" Jesus, I don't know.<br /><br />I think the main highlights of my day were, getting up at seven, showering, dressing, gathering my things, packing food for my lunch, and making it to the bus by eight. Another highlight was also a call from JK. She told me that if anyone in the WRAP workshop touched her (on the arm) again, she would not hesitate to report it to the authorities or use pepper spray. That's fine. I totally understand and respect that (I'll admit that I'm saying through gritted teeth). The part that does not sit well with me is that she wanted <em>me</em> to be the one to convey this to the facilitator. I did it, but now that I think about it, I should have said, ""If you feel as strongly as you do about this matter, I think <em>you</em> should be the one to tell the facilitator."" I'll be there with you, I'll support you, blah, blah blah....<br /><br />And I'm kicking myself - NOW!<br /><br />JK has the worst case of anxiety I think I have ever been a wittness to. If you were to rate it on a scale of one to ten, it would fall at 19. It's got her so paralyzed, she can hardly speak most of the time! But when she does, look out! On one hand, she is very poised, articulate, insightful and delightful - and on another she is very, very bold and very, very forthright. She reminds me a lot of a carrot on a stick, a little sparrow with two broken wings, a wise ethnic woman, and chicken little all rolled into one. She gives you just enough to get completely hooked and wanting more, and then she sees that you're hooked, coils up and pulls away. And she takes everything so darn literally! And the rhythm of her speach is like steam coming out of a covered pot. Sometimes there are bursts, and sometimes there is nothing - and sometimes it's dry. Dry, dry, dry. I am really working hard to build trust and rapport with her. Don't know why, but for some reason, my heart is really touched by her, and I really believe in her, and know she can do it - whatever it might be. And, she is such a sensitive and vulnerable little bird. I figure if I can be careful enough, and work slowly and methodically to earn her trust, then keep it - I'll have done a really good thing.<br /><br />Even though JK is a frustrating as all hell challenge for me, seeing the smile on her face and feeling the joy that emminates from her when I hit a sweet spot, makes it all worth it. Underneath all that anxiety, I think she is really awesome. :)"

"event","Last night I went to Kate's house for dinner, then got up this morning, read my horoscope and laughed. It said that ""A quick survey of the financial news might reveal to you that your investments, particularly those involving property, might currently be worth far more than you think"". This is funny to me  when I think about what this could possibly relate to. Kate lives in a ghetto - just a little far back from a really nice and swinging neighborhood, but a ghetto just the same. I thought it would be nice - nicer than the ghetto I live in. But it wasn't. It actually sucked. It was an older building, stuffy as all hell, small and so like a prison. In fact, one of Kate's living room walls was painted brick, and her front door automatically locks when it's closed. It's just set up to automatically lock when you close it.

Seeing this, and knowing that Kate is the same age as my mother and has nothing but just barely the basics as far as furniture and things are concerned, made me feel bad for her and her fiance T. That kind of ghetto living is no way to start a married life. Well, ghetto living is no way to start or have a married or family life as far as I'm concerned. The ghetto should only be temporary, or for those who want to be down by choice. It shouldn't be for those who are down by circumstance of something they can never change (like disability). But unfortunately, as far as the society and the government is concerned, those who are down by circumstances they can not change,  are lumped in with those who are down for the temporary, or down by choice. It sucks! And, even though I hate the ghetto where I live, I'm glad I live here and not where Kate and T do. My place is the nicer of the ghettos I have seen. And I've seen quite a few. And I'll see more I'm sure.

Someday, I should make a coffee table book of ghettos in America or something. Really! Because if you think about it, there's a lot to be said for these ""places where the po' folk live"" Ghettos are a lot like quilts I guess. They all have the same elements that distinguish them as being ghettos, but each ghetto has it's own flavor and culture - and there are tons and tons of people, and tons and tons of stories. Like a melting pot. Maybe ghettos are really America at it's finest in disguise?

Went to work today feeling cranky, tired and moody - and I didn't have much patience. Knowing this, I stayed at my desk most of the day as much as I could, and slowly cranked away on paperwork. My goal is to have all that stuff caught up by the end of the week.

Had lunch today with Kate. We ate from this boxed lunch place that everyone at work is raving about. You get a sandwhich, chips, fruit, a cookie and a drink delivered for ten and just under two quarters. I thought it was a rip off, and didn't like what I got all that well. I thought the food could have been much better for what I paid, and i thought most of the price of the meal was in the packaging, presentation and delivery. I'll try not to order from them again if I can help it. And, I'll pay Kate the money I owe her tomorrow. Lunch was her idea, and I'm still having issues with my bank card."

"event","Just got done having dinner with my neighbor KAB - a supreme pizza from Pizza Schmut. It was alright for delivery, but I've definitely had better.<br /><br />KAB and I ate, talked about our families and the things they do to, and expect of us, tried to play the card version of the LIFE game (but were unsuccessful at it), ate fireballs, listened to music, and took turns asking each other trivia questions from the 80's game. We had a good time. It made me glad to have a friend with the qualities that KAB has, and it made me glad that she has been my friend in some way, shape or form, for the last seven years. I am very lucky to have her and - another.<br /><br />Wish Furce was in that group of friends too. It's one of my dreams for him to someday be in that loop. Tonight I thought of him as KAB and I were playing cards. I remembered the times that Furce and I used to play cards with his brother and sister-in-law.&nbsp; I miss being a part of that. It was fun. <br /><br />Went to <em>The Dollar Tree</em> on 182nd today. Got some cool things there to accessorize my cube at work. And, I liked the Brit who happened to be my cashier. She was nice, conscientious, and packed my things very well. And in no way was she condiscending. She was quite the opposite. Very refreshing! But I'll never go to that store again - at least not until they fix the curbs on Division. There are no cuts on the north side. So, if you're in a chair or other mobility device, and you need to cross the street,&nbsp; you have to go in the bike lane to get to a driveway - which puts you in the turn lane, right along with the cars. Very scary! Thank God I was wearing my orange hat. Otherwise, I bet I'd have been hit. But then again, I wonder - if I had been hit, would I have cared? I'm in one of these moods of late where getting hurt bad physically, or being very sick, sounds kind of nice - only because it would give me a nice break from the emotional things that have&nbsp; been happening for me for the last eight months.<br /><br />Tomorrow I am due to go to breakfast with the happy couple, who ""made love three times"" last night - Kate and T. We are going to Lydia's for omlettes and I am most worried about being able to pay. I have been having trouble with my bank card lately. Got a new one because my card was determined ""vulnerable to unauthorized transactions"" and now no machine likes my PIN - not a point of sale, not an ATM, not one. They don't even like the new pin I gave myself because I thought there was something wrong with the old one. I hope it's just a freak. My plan is to go try and withdraw from another machine tomorrow before I meet them. Hopefully, all will go well."

"event","After the bustle and chaos of the morning and early afternoon, this day was good. Got a short but good amount of work done, enjoyed the bus ride home, and looked forward to tomorrow. My plan is to sleep in a bit, then go to the dollar store and get some little things that aren't necessary, but will help my worklife function much easier and better. I also want to find some funky stuff to accessorize my cubicle.<br /><br />The St. Patty's Day party was today at work. I tried to help, but confess that I didn't want to. I hate ILR consumer parties! I spent most of my time behind the front desk with Kate - trying to choke down the crap food that was served. Mostly taters with some sort of meat mixed in. Too rich and greasy for my taste. My stomach told me to stop after half a plate of the main meal, as my head couldn't take the visions of guzzling down a big fat vat of gravy anymore. That's what eating this food was like - drinking a vat of gravy.<br /><br />The best part of the whole meal was the apple crumb pie and the frosted sugar cookie. It was like a really thick and chewy ""Mother's Circus Animal"" with drier frosting - <em>very</em> good. :)<br /><br />Facilitated the writing group today. Was surprised at what came out of me during a write for the prompt ""If I had a million dollars..."". I focused a lot on <em>the smell</em> of money, and wondered if a million dollars smelled the same as five, ten or twenty. And I wondered if different denominations of money knew or cared about who they were going to, what they were being used for, and how they were perceived. And I wondered if, say a twenty, meant and functioned the same in the hands of a rich person as opposed to a poor one. Would one value a twenty more than the other? If so, in what ways? This got me to thinking about my parents again, and how I (their daughter) am living in a government subsidized housing project, while they are getting ready to move into a half to two million dollar mansion of a house. And then they say ""Everything we have done and are doing is for you!"" I'm sorry, but I'm not seeing&nbsp; it. And, if I had everything they did, I'd make completely different use out of it. I see this mansion house thing as a golden opprtunity to help, that's being sorely missed<br /><br />I guess how you use or utilize things though, depends on how, and in what ways you value them?<br /><br />Thought about my parents, my brothers, my sister and and my paternal cousins on the way home. I thought about how it's so unfortunate that we have all met the same fate in our own respective ways. None of us have relationships with our parents and families really. We all got to that point, that fork in the road where you decide whether or not you like and love your parents and want to continue walking along the path&nbsp; with them, and we all decided that we don't. We all decided that we don't really like our parents and that being around them is not a good thing - because they are not good people.<br /><br />I wonder what that means for all of us? Does it mean that we will have different fates, better fates, than our parents?"

Came home, and didn't plan to, but worked some, as I wasn't able to get as much done at the office today as I would have liked - too many interuptions and distractions. <br /><br />Did some housing research for KB, emailed him, and wrote an email on behalf of KH. He has ambitions to be a film critic for a community newspaper, and doesn't know how to go about getting there. So he's asked me (one who is totally green about that subject) to help him. I'm seeing what I can do. It doesn't set well with me though that (somehow) he has managed to (supposedly) get two movies he has made, commissioned to a major cable network. But yet he ""doesn't feel comfortable"" calling a newspaper and asking for a job. Hmmm? Smells fishy to me. My guess is, he got into one of those programs for young gimps, pulled the gimp card, had someone ""set things up for him"" and got his movies commissioned that way. And I'll bet that, the only way he worked hard was making the movies. I bet he did very little to none of the leg work in getting his movies commissioned. Which makes me angry because, Furce has worked his ass off, he is an awesome film maker, and he's got nothin' but loadin' film and makin' sandwhiches for thankless directors and PA's in&nbsp; L.A. Unfair!<br /><br />Speaking of Furce, I wrote him an email last night. I've been writing him every now and then with things since the break up. Got no reply like usual.

"event","Today was Wednesday - my slammed to the rafters, timing is critical, busy with no breaks day - at least for five more weeks.<br /><br />It started out OK enough. Even though I <em>really</em> pushed it on the sleeping in, I got up with just enough time to get a shower, gather my things and get myself out the door - to catch the bus - where a prickly bristled, sour, hot air filled, <em>man</em> of a bus driver was waiting for me. ""Do you want straps?""&nbsp; And, ""Do you have a pass?"" ""Yes I do!"" I said to both things.<br /><br />I knew when this driver asked me for a pass, the ride would be unusual. My suspicions proved me right when we got to 130th, and picked up a mixed race young gent who was (deliberately) five cents short on his fare. Instead of refusing to take him, the driver made the choice to start an argument with this man instead. He and the driver (especially) were making issue, and yelling back and forth on the bus. This didn't set well with me, so I piped up, with a nickel in my hand, and said forcefully, ""If I give you a freakin' nickel will you shut up about the fare?!"" <br /><br />Just then, the driver pulled over, stopped the bus and said, ""OK, you're off the bus!"" I thought he was speaking to me, but quickly realized he was speaking to the gent. ""Here's five cents! Let him ride!"" I said. ""It's not about the fare, it's about his attitude!"" The driver said. To that I replied, ""Well, just a minute ago you said it was about the fare! I think you just want to argue."" Then I went on to tell him that he'd be wise to make up his mind about what the real issue was before he argued with young gents anymore. He didn't say anything more after that.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Got to work, was there for a while (and happy to be at my desk, working, and among my colleagues and friends) then went into a meeting - the weekly check in and case review. I thought it would be boring and like pulling teeth to sit through, but it actually went pretty well. DH and PK didn't whine very much, and DH didn't harp or ramble (much). And I took the liberty of leaving as soon as I taken care of what I needed to. <br /><br />--------------<br /><br />WRAP came after. The beginning of this week's workshop was kind of hairy, all because someone touched someone, meant it to be taken as a joke, and it was not. And believe it or not, someone who wasn't even involved in the touching took <em>complete</em> offense, felt compelled to leave the workshop, and also state that he didn't know if he'd ever be returning to it. He was angry because the choice had been made <em>not</em> to talk about the incident surrounding the touching, during the workshop. My thought on that was, ""Why bring everyone down and distract them from their reason for being here, if we don't have to?""<br /><br />This man (older) that was offended by the touching, I'm deducting, has suffered <em>terrible</em>, <em>brutal</em> and unspeakable abuse of the sexual kind. And this happened when he was small - a toddler. My guess is, he still has not healed from that, and really needs help - bad. In&nbsp; fact, as I write this, I wonder if he is getting or has gotten any help? I think tomorrow, I will follow up on that.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Spent the time after WRAP working - trying to find emergency rent assistance for&nbsp; a puerto-rican from New York who's got cognitive and emotional issues. He is fascinating to me! But, the wells are dry, and he needs assistance for April. What do I do? What do I do?<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Also heard from and spoke to CP and KB today. I am proud of CP. He has reached a point where he doesn't need my help anymore. We spoke today, and he asked me to close his case. When he first came to me, I didn't think I'd be able to find the resources to help him. But I did (with a little help from my friends). How cool, how cool. He was really between a rock and a hard place. <br /><br />As for KB, I don't know about him, but I am definitely feeling some chemistry on my end. Every time we talk or see each other, I feel really excited in the spirit, and all my sex parts&nbsp; tingle happily. And every time we see each other and especially talk, I feel as though I am speaking to a guy who's sweet on me, a guy whom I'm dating, or a guy whom I'm married to. And, I find that I'm looking forward to, and loving his calls and the messages he leaves. ""Hi, this is K..."" He says. I love that! :) But, I have to remember, this guy is my consumer, I don't know him very well at all, he could be lying to me, he's young, I don't know if what he really wants from life has gelled yet, and I am <em>supposed</em> to, and <em>do</em>, love another man - Furce. A man who has not called or contacted me in months, and a man who has no interest in me anymore. Actually, now I am wondering if he ever had any real interest in me at all. I think the only thing he may have really liked, was my vagina. Which is sad, because I wanted and expected a lot more out of him. I expected a lot more out of the loss of my virginity. Anyway, that is neither here nor there.<br /><br /><br />"

I'll guess that had something to do with the fire alarm going off shortly after 12am last night.<br /><br />Even though I stayed home, and had serious cabin fever and <em>really</em> wanted to go out, I tried to make the best of things and work anyway. I got a little paperwork done, and attended some DSAC meetings by phone. The topics of the day were LW's woes with ADS, and the elections for the county commission and the governor's race. Everyone on the council was in hot debate, while I paid no mind and had no comment - one because I am ignorant about what the state and county really needs, and two because I don't want anyone, especially those yahoo's on the council to influence my vote. By the way, I saw a little snipit of the TV news today, and saw that Jim Hill is dark skinned. I didn't know that. And, for some reason, I don't care about what Diane Linn has done and how she has broken the law this and that many times. It's most important to me that I have, at least a good working relationship with her, and that we can work together to accomplish our respective goals on different projects. And, as far as I'm concerned, she has done nothing bad to me, and I haven't been wittness to her doing anything bad. She's been nice, and she seems interested and vested in enough of the right things, and smart. but I don't know.

Part of me is looking forward to it, but the other is not. My brothers and my sister just ignored them outright, during the times they were experiencing similar shit to what I'm experiencing with my parents now. Part of me wishes I could do that too, but the other part of me wouldn't feel right. I'd feel like I was disappointing Albert, my grandfather, who is dead and has been for many years, somehow. He was always big on seeing to it that I did the right thing, and took the initiative to step up and be the bigger person."

She'll be here for at least the next five days, and man is she a slob! She makes her presence known, and herself at home everywhere! She's a pain in my back, head and belly. Hate her, but am glad to be having her. Her visits have been really irregular since Furce left. And she's different somehow. I'm afraid one day, she might come and bring a tumor with her, as that's what happened to my aunt. Or, maybe she'll just stop coming altogether. She's been making visits to me sinnce I was ten. Maybe she's getting tired. And, I think my spring allergies have hit. My right ear is really bothering me! It's clogged and the gland underneath it is swollen and hurting.

Got up around 1pm, did the laundry, cleaned the kitchen, cooked some and ate. Planned to stay up for the rest of the day, but felt like taking another nap after the laundry was done. I did that, and then got up around 6:30 and worked on some things for work. Took care of some consumer stuff that was left hanging because of those dumb I&R calls I had to take care of last week. 

Cried today too - over Furce, my parents, and the fact that only old dudes, pedifiles and creepy guys seem to want to persue me and ask me out. What does that say about me? Am I that much of a piece of shit?! In my parents eyes, I was worth cashing in for a big fat ritzy house and a half to two million dollars. Me. Only worth a house and two million dollars? That's chincy. And I wish, wish, wish that Furce would get his head together and come back! Damn it! Even though he told me I wasn't, he acted like I was worth a whole hell of a lot to him. I wish he'd get his shit together, get unconfused and come back!"

I do that sometimes. I think it's a way of burning off mental energy for me.<br /><br />Took a nap after. Only meant to be there for an hour or so, but ended up staying until it was absolutely time for me to shower, get ready, and go to dinner. A bunch of my colleagues and I got together and went to <em>The Old Spaghetti Factory</em> to celebrate Kate and DH's birthday's. We had trouble getting in, as it was busting at the seams crowded. But once we did, good food and a good time were had by all. I enjoyed myself very much, and resolved to make it a point to get out like that more.<br /><br />I have to say though, I felt embarrassed by the incidents that surrounded us getting in. I was the first one to arrive. After waiting in a very long line, I made it up to the reservation desk. I felt intimadated because the desk was so high, I could not hear the hostess, and she could not hear me. But, I did the best I could, and asked if my party was there. I also said that I wasn't sure, but my party may have made reservations.&nbsp; ""We don't take reservations Ma'am."" I was told. After hearing these words, I looked at the rediculous crowd of people that surrounded me, and said to myself ""You <em>don't</em> take reservations?! But you have a party of <em>twelve</em> gimps coming - complete with mobility devices and guide dogs. This place is busting at the seams crowded! And you <em>don't</em> take reservations?!""<br /><br />I left the desk with a sunken heart, feeling small, insignificant, prejudiced and hanging my head in disappointment, and thinking about how it would be once everyone else arrived. I could hear PK's whining in my head, everyone's words of confusion, and everyone dissing RC. Going to this place was her idea, she was responsible for making the reservations - and she screwed up again!<br /><br />I excused myself, and went outside to get away from the crowd and think. I called Kate, asked where she was, and told her the situation. ""I'm still waiting for my LIFT."" She said. ""I'll call you when they've got me.""<br /><br />I stayed outside, waited, observed the crowd for a while longer, and mulled over the information given to me by the hostess. Then I made the decision to reserve us all a spot, just in case.<br /><br />I endured another long and confusing line, made it up to the desk again , and asked the hostess how tables were reserved. She told me, and I put in a reservation for eight - with two mobility devices and three service animals. I told her I would need the table at seven, and she told me it would be an hour wait. ""Oh great!"" I thought. ""If what she says is true, that will put us at a table by a quarter of eight - and we have rides coming at 9:30! And they're crowded! I think we'll be lucky if we get to eat tonight!""<br /><br />I reluctantly took the pager the hostess gave me, went outside again, and waited. Just then I saw DH, J, and their friends G and C. That meant that four more people, and two more guide dogs that we hadn't expected, would be added to our party. ""Oh great! They're gonna love this!"" I thought to myself.<br /><br />I didn't want to, but I told DH about the situation surrounding our reservations. Just then she started whining. ""But I thought RC was supposed to make the reservations. She told us she made reservations!""<br /><br />I wanted to tell DH to shut up, as whining wasn't going to solve anything. What we needed to do was go back inside and add four more people to our party. <br /><br />""J wants to go to the bar"", DH said. ""The bar's upstairs."" I told her. ""Oh great! she said. ""Yeah."" I replied. ""Oh great.""<br /><br />We went back inside. DH kept on with her whining, but I tried the best I could to tune her out. I endured another line, made it up to the desk, and added four more people to our party. I was told this would add a half hour to our wait. That would put us at the table by 8:15, and eating by a quarter of 9 if we were lucky.<br /><br />Just then, suddenly everyone was there. Twelve gimps, three mobility devices and four guide dogs - clogging up the lobby of <em>The Old Spaghetti Factory</em> on a Saturday night.<br /><br />RC and I talked, and it was concluded that she would speak to a manager with the hopes of getting us in sooner. She did. She told the story as it happened, exaggerated the right things just a little bit, and outright lied other times. She also pulled the pitty and gimp cards. This got us in within 20 minutes, and eating 20 minutes after that. I was glad for this, because I had a hard time believing that it would take an hour and a half to accommodate us (given the flow of traffic in and out the door) and it meant that we could accomplish what we came there to, but I was embarrassed because we did this on lies and requested <em>special treatment </em>to do it<em> </em>. It's funny because, in the work we do every day, special treatment is something we advocate <em>against</em>. But yet, in our own personal lives, it's something we strive to get. Hmmm? No wonder we can't ever get anything done. We're always fighting for two things that contradict each other!"

"event","I meant for this day to go better than it did, but it didn't - for about half the time anyway. After around 3pm though, things started to get better and become more to my liking.<br /><br />It was my intention to spend the morning getting ready for Women's Group, working on consumer stuff, and getting more paperwork done if there was time. Instead I spent the time tending to more ""funky I&amp;R"" calls that came in - again. This was my yesterday too. Kate (formerly KM) was tending the phones, and I was the only counselor in. Kate is relatively new to the phones, and the skinny on them yet, hasn't quite gelled with her. She's got who to refer where pretty much down, but she's not quite sure what to purge and what to keep that's questionable. People have been calling in with situations that could be defined as crisis, and they have been pulling at her heart strings. ""My name came up on the list for section&nbsp; 8, I can get into the house this weekend, but I'm short $100 on my deposit, no other agency will help me! Can you?"", ""I'm a stupid little girl who doesn't understand the system and<em> just </em>got out of a domestic violence situation, I'm at the courthouse <em>right now</em>, fresh from getting a restraining order, I don't want to go into a shelter, and I need a perminent house NOW! The crisis line told me to call you. Help me."", and ""I'm an old lady who can't hear worth a crap and need wheelchair ramps. Can you help me?""<br /><br />I didn't have time to do any of the work I needed to because I got stuck fielding these I&amp;R calls.&nbsp; And feilding the calls is much more than taking a call. It's taking time out to find resources, then taking the time to document (we have to document everything short of eating and peeing at where I work). Then, we have to call people back. That can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a half hour for me. <br /><br />Having to field these calls was all because Kate was on the phones. If AH had been answering them, it wouldn't have been an issue. I've really got to speak to BQ about this, but I don't want to do it in front of DH and PK, as I'm afraid they'll start beating the drums of negativity and harp and harp and harp, draw things out, and make much more out of things than need be. That kind of gets us away from the real issue - which makes meetings much longer, and doesn't allow us to accomplish much of what we set out to.<br /><br />The afternoon went better. No one really called, so it was quiet. And, women's group went really well. But that was after Kate came in, and helped me do a presentation on setting boundaries. We did the presentation as a series of little impromtu skits, and we used peoples real life experiences as examples to make our points with. The women really seemed engaged and responsive. I'm thinking having presentations and another facilitator (particularly Kate) is the way to go. My plan is to talk to BQ about that next week.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />Went to the WRAP reading after work.&nbsp; I <em>really</em> didn't want to go, and I <em>really</em> didn't want to read - too much on my mind, and too hard of a day.&nbsp; And I just didn't feel well and up to it. But I read anyway. ""Fifteen, Fish, And Yoga"". The piece that was published in the fall anthology.<br /><br />I almost didn't make it to the reading, because I went to the wrong Peet's - the one on Washington instead of Broadway. Too much on my mind, and not really being present is what did it. But, I caught the #8 though, and made it there in time, with about 15 minutes to spare. It was great to ride the #8, and it was great to be in that neighborhood, and great to do something different for a change.<br /><br />L came to the reading, as I invited him. I was glad others were there, and it wasn't just him and I. And I was glad I was distracted by other people and the happenings there. And I was&nbsp; glad L and I didn't have much time to talk, as I sensed that if we did,&nbsp; the conversation would have become unncomfortable, made me feel dirty, and would have ruined my evening.<br /><br />When the reading was over, we walked CM home (she was there). Then L wanted to walk me to the bus stop. I let him, even though I didn't want to. I really wanted to ditch him, and run like a bat out of hell, to a bus or train that would carry me home.&nbsp; We meant to take a short little jaunt, but ended up having this little adventure - trying to find a bus stop, then an open bus stop, then a bus that was going my way, and waiting. During the course of things, we talked. The conversation started out innocently enough, but then got, what is considered these days, on the fringes of inappropriate. We started talking about our experiences with VR, then the subject moved to L's taking of Viagra, and how long he can keep it up, and how far he can go if he takes it. He also told me it's been just in the last year and a half that he's been thinking about having sex. This put images in my head of a pointy bald headed, gimped old man whacking off and having sex, which I <em>did not</em> want to see! I tried my best to tune him out and pay his comments no mind. But, at the same time, I tried to pay attention, and listen very hard to understand him, and find out what his needs were.<br /><br />A bus finally came. It was a #9 that I thought could take me home and away from L. As I went to board it, L told me he had a lovely evening. I said,&nbsp; ""Yeah, it was fun wasn't it?"" Then I went to shake his hand. He took it, shook it, then put it up to his mouth and kissed it.&nbsp; I didn't like this, and wanted to protest. But, the bus was there, I felt too shocked and taken aback,&nbsp; and I wanted my hand back so I could drive.&nbsp; He wouldn't give it back, so I snatched it back as if&nbsp; I were taking it out of a tight fitting long leather glove.&nbsp; I&nbsp; went up to the bus and asked the driver, ""Can you take me home?""&nbsp; ""Sorry, I only go to Deekum"",&nbsp; He said.&nbsp; ""If you want to go home you have to catch it&nbsp; over there.""&nbsp; And he pointed to the next block.<br /><br />""Oh Great!"" I thought. More time with L,&nbsp; it's late, I'm tired and I want to go home!&nbsp; Stomp!. I turned to L, told him what the driver had just told me, and said I was just going to take the MAX. I started walking and he rolled with me. I walked with him, trying to pay him no mind but give him attention too. I spent the time dreaming of dragging along a 50 pound sack of potatoes and a ball and chain, and dreaming of ditching him too - driving in a moving car and throwing him over the highway rail and into the river. Or, just simply running away.<br /><br />We walked, and I dreamed of the ditching, remembered the times that gimper and I used to go on little adventures similar to the one that L and I were currently&nbsp; on, and thinking of Furce - and remembering the time that we walked a span of the same neighborhood where L and I were, on our way to and from dinner one night. We went to <em>The Village Inn</em>. It was Furce's first time there and he loved it. It was so cute to watch him get so excited about how much food you could get for such little money. I remember that night he kept looking at me, giving me ""that look"" and holding and stroking my hand. He couldn't take his eyes off me. I got home that night and found a message on my machine that said, ""I think we're connecting in a way I can't explain"". I felt like it was the first time he ever told me he loved me.<br /><br />L and I walked past <em>The Village Inn </em>on our way to Lloyd Center then to the MAX. I kept looking at the sign, then back at the sign, focusing on it and thinking of Furce, our time there, and mustering up the courage and resolve to contnue to carry the ball and chain&nbsp; that L was to me, with gladness, contentment and peace in my heart. <br /><br />L and I got into the mall, and somehow the conversation&nbsp; got around to his leaving. ""I can go myself."" I said. ""You don't have to come with me."" ""Are you sure? He Asked. ""Yes, I'm sure"" I told him. Then he gave me those ""I want sex from you"" puppy dog eyes and tried to hold my right hand. I made it spasm so he couldn't grab it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also dreamed of slapping him in the face (enough to leave a mark, sting and draw blood), punching him hard in the jaw and gut, kicking the crap out of him, and leaving the sorry ass piece of shit for dead. We pleasantly and cordially parted though. As soon as I was out of his view, I ran as fast as my chair would carry me, away, and to the elevator to take me down. As I did, I thought about boundaries and how I could set them -&nbsp; and how I would,&nbsp; set them next time. In addition to my resolving to be direct and firm with him next tim, I decided to take a kind counseling route, and view his desire to have sex with me as an unmet need.&nbsp; I resolved that I would work on my own time, to find him resources to meet, greet, hook up and bang the crap out of anyone else but me!<br />"

<strong>1) 10 years ago what did you think you would be doing now?<br /><br /></strong>I thought I'd be doing pretty much the same thing I am doing now. The only differences are: 1) I never dreamed I'd go to school to be an artist, 2) I never dreamed my life's ambition and real passion would be to want to work and make a living as a creative, 3) I thought I'd be married, 4) I thought I'd have a dog, 5) I thought I'd live in a house, and 6). I thought I'd have a good and comfortable number of connecting, meaningful relationships and things to do.<br /><strong><br />2) Where do you think you will be in 5 years from now?<br /><br /></strong>I'm hoping that five years from now I'll be married, have that dog, that house, and those meaningful relationships. I want to go places in relationships that, from my perspective, my parents needed to, but never did. I want to connect and spend lots of meaningful time with lots of things - plants, animals, children, family and anything that's living. I also would like to find comfort, solace and inspiration in my family, whomever they may be. Also, I hope to feel comfortable and confident enough to take on more risks in my life and career. I'd like to take on things I never dreamed I would want or do ten years ago. I'd like to take on the challenge of being a mother, wife, and part of another family. I'd also like to travel, and possibly work as a creative instead of a counselor.<strong><br /><br />3) Do you live life one day at a time or look to the future.<br /><br /></strong>I think I do both.&nbsp; Mostly I live one day at a time, but sometimes, depending, I look to the future.<br /><strong><br />4) Do you wish you could go back in time and undo something in your life?<br /><br /></strong>I think the only thing I wish I could change now is the way things went down with Furce. I wish I hadn't felt so nervous and excited with him. It impaired my judgement and ability on a lot of things. And I wish I'd have felt comfortable enough and had the courage to speak my mind more, and be more of myself. I think if I hadn't been in such a stranglehold with those things, <em>the real me</em> would have been able to come out more, and we'd still be together today.<strong><br /><br />5) If you could send a message back in time and give a younger version of yourself some advice, what would it be?</strong><br /><br />Today, I would tell myself to always strive to trust my gut - because my gut never, ever lies. My gut tells me how to be, who to trust, and what things to follow and focus on, and what things to cast away. Every time I have listened to my gut, I have always prospered. Every time I have not, I have always failed or&nbsp; fallen - some way or somehow."

"event","One of the things I <em>love</em> about having the disability&nbsp; I do is - well, the peepee factor. Yes, I'm 33, and sometimes I still pee my pants. And, when I really have to go, I do the CP equivellant of the potty dance - I wiggle like a fiend. All this makes me feel like <em>such</em> a woman, and <em>so </em>sexy and beautiful - like a goddess - not! Actually, it makes me feel like the gimpiset gimp around<br /><br />I peed my pants today, shortly after arriving home. I'd held it all the way from 39th, and thought I would make it, but the muscles in my bladder saw it differently. ""We don't want to!"" They protested. ""We're tired and don't want to be strong and hold back the stream for you!"" With that, they drop kicked and the pee came out. Thank God it wasn't while I was in&nbsp; my chair. Those accidents are a bitch to clean up. Well, every accident&nbsp; is a bitch, but those are exceptionally so. This one was actually pretty easy.&nbsp; The pants soaked up most of the pee, and the rest went into the toilet.&nbsp; All I had to do was strip, transfer, wipe everything down with vinegar,&nbsp; put the dirty clothes in the hamper, and get myself into the shower and get cleaned up.<br /><br />As I was doing this, I thought of the times I used to have accidents when I was growing up. I had lots then. I think it was because of stress. Every time I would have an accident,&nbsp; I remember feeling like I imagine a puppy would feel after peeing on the carpet - ashamed. I didn't like being scolded after peeing, so I would try to hide the fact that I did. I hid my clothes and tried to clean myself and everything else up without my parents knowing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I even tried to pee without my parents knowing! But, they found out and they knew anyway. This was when I was in my teens! I wished they'd have helped me embrace this faux pas and make accomodations for myself rather than continue to scold me for it.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />There were some rather distracting and negative moments in this day, but on the whole it was good. I got a little bit of good work done, and I got to clean and clear my workspace some. I also got to have coffee and cupcakes and gab with AH and KM, and have lunch with KM and PK. Today was KM's birthday, so we went to Genie's to celebrate. KM had a BLT and $10 worth of liquor, PK had a grilled cheese, soup and some very sharp and sour conversation, and I had a burger, fries, and I guess my usual quiet observancy, chipping in wherever I felt comfortable.<br /><br />I am concerned about both KM and PK. KM has taken up drinking a lot more since she got with her new beau. I've been witness to her drinking twice this week on&nbsp; her lunch. Granted, she doesn't go back to work after, but she's drinking in the middle of the day. And R, the jerk waiter at Genie's, is happy to serve her. I think he gets his jollies out of watching a blind chick get sauced. I wonder if he goes home at night and tells whomever about that? I bet you so.<br /><br />And PK, I'm concerned about her because her tongue and her words have been increasingly sharp and negative since - well, as long as I've known her. But they've become even moreso, since SW's firing.&nbsp; It's tough to be around her now because she's so, so negative, in a hissy and vindictive sort of way. She's even walking differently and wearing different clothes now. She's dressing more conservatively, and walks very sharply - like she's cutting through thick bushes. And, I think she's gained some weight. I notice her ass seems to be getting bigger by the week.<br /><br />I think KM and PK,&nbsp; and DH too, are all bothered by their own respective issues and changes.<br /><br />By the way, DH is another one who's keen on negativity.&nbsp; She, as well as PK can really drag a meeting out, and bring a meeting down. They both did that yesterday.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />There is a reading tomorrow night for WRAP. Furce, if you're reading this, I'd love for you to come. You don't have to show your face, just come. I'll be reading and I want you&nbsp; to be there. It will be at Peete's Coffee and Tea from 7-8pm. The address is 1441 NE Broadway, Downtown."

"event","I think God sent me a present today in the form of a meeting with a man - KB. His father M came to see me the other day. He left me with the impression that KB was really messed up, and completely irresponsible, disrespectful and ungrateful. But, I found KB to be quite the opposite. He seemed very kind, pleasant, smart, on-the-ball and articulate. He also&nbsp; seemed and looked to be very far from the teenaged boy his father made him out to be. It seemed like the only bad thing KB really had going for him, was circumstance, lack of knowledge, and a domineering father with serious issues and baggage.

KB and I met. From my perspective, we had a surprisingly uncanny good time. The conversation was comfortable, easy and free-flowing, and I felt at peace. at ease, a little nervous, excited and pleasantly happy. Also, I had a sneaking suspicion that the outside of me was being looked over, while the inside of me was being greatly liked and admired. :)

KB and I met for an hour and a half. As he went to leave, he shook my hand and put his free hand over the top of both of our connected hands as he did. I read once, that if someone shakes your hand in that way, it's a sign that they really like you. Remembering this, and reflecting on our meeting. I bet myself a hot fudge sundae that KB would&nbsp; be asking me out&nbsp; in some way, shape or form, soon enough. 

During the bus ride home,&nbsp; I thought about KB and our meeting, and got the cart before the horse like usual again. Like usual, it didn't take long for me to get ""The Picket Fence Dream"" out of the closet, dust it off&nbsp; erect it, and have it looking flawless (minus the usual wear and tear) like usual again. First date, kissing, ""I love you"", sex, living together, then marriage. 

That's how&nbsp; ""The Picket Fence Dream"" has gone every time for, I don't know how many years. Pulling it out so soon like I did and do, made and makes me feel ashamed - like there's something wrong with me.&nbsp; Truth be told I'd take any guy who would take me. If a guy came to me, said, ""Stink, I want to be with you - marry you - tomorrow... "" I'd do it if he treated me well and I thought he was worthy enough. 

I jump into things so fast when it comes to romantic relationships. Why? Is it because I've gone through the majority of my life not feeling like I've mattered to many, and I want to matter to one? 

I also thought about my feelings about Furce, and ""The Picket Fence Dream"" in relation to him as well. I know I messed up. I pushed ""The Picket Fence Dream"" on him (even though I tried not to) and I think that's what ultimately drove him away. I was only working to secure that he would love me best, and want me to be with him forever. But instead I may very possibly have driven away one of the dearest and most treasured people I've had the pleasure to know. Shame on me.

As for my feelings for Furce, what will happen to those if something gets going with KB? And what will happen to the dreams? The house, the yard, the kids, the dogs, the family, the life - and&nbsp; the stubborn, angry, and oh so particular ""got to have it his way"", German-blooded&nbsp; (and tempered) husband? Will those be going away? Will I be asked to move on,&nbsp; and love someone else?

If that's the case, no! Frown, frown, stomp, stomp, cry, cry. I've worked so hard and I've been so determined and dedicated. Even though Furce is gone I have worked to keep faith, hope, or whatever you want to call it, alive. I can't let him go now! I've invested way too much time and energy! 

But, on the other hand, if I don't let him go, would I be missing my dream?"

But, we do know the vote was ""a cliffhanger"" and that ""The president looks forward to signing the bill into law,""<br /><br />16 expiring provisions of the original Patriot Act, including one that allows federal officials to obtain ""tangible items""&nbsp; for ""foreign intelligence"" and ""international terrorism investigations"" will be renewed. Hmmm? Do tangible items include other human beings? Oh! I mean ""enemy combatants"".&nbsp; Probably. And what exactly are the other 15 ""provisions?<br />
<p>Other provisions would ""clarify"" that ""foreign intelligence"" or ""counterintelligence officers"" should <em>share information</em> obtained as part of a ""criminal investigation"" with counterparts in ""domestic law enforcement agencies"". I think that's code for, snoop, get anything you can, and share it with any and every cop agency or outfit in this country. Yeah, and we know that every policeman's motto is ""handle with care"". They've&nbsp; painstakingly modeled themselves after the mafia I'm sure. That's their motto too.<br /></p>
<p>Alrighty then! Moving on...<br /></p>
<p>In other news, Dana Reeve, wife of Superman Christopher Reeve ""passed away from lung cancer"". She ""devoted herself to his care and his cause after he was ""paralyzed"". Oh! Oh! Wait! If I try <em>really hard</em>, maybe I can pull a heartstring or shed a tear. Nope. On second thought, I'll need an onion.<br /></p>
<p>Pull-ease! Who is the yahoo that wrote this article?! No one ""dies of lung cancer"". And she did not ""devote herself to him"" after he was paralyzed. She stuck by him despite the fact that <em>he was</em> paralyzed. Thank you AP. Another opportunity to educate America,&nbsp; missed - again. And, bye-bye Dana - will miss you. And thanks for <a href=""http://streamed.wired.md/display2.pl?doc_user=reeveweb&amp;resize=600x625&amp;Treatment=R1003&amp;submit_type=play&amp;enter_type=web&amp;streamtype=fhi&amp;suppressButtons=yes"">the video</a>. <br /></p>
<p>In other news still - NPR says colleges and universities will no longer receive federal funding if they choose not to allow millitary recruiters on campus. Will they be coming complete with Nazi armbands? And, will they give Nazi swag away for free, as incentive to get people to ""sign up"" and, become part of the machine - the machine that made you, and the machine that can (and will) take you.<br /></p>
<p>Lastly, *gasp"" Pakistan is still supporting the Taliban - letting their ""troops"" and ""associates""<em> hide</em> in the rough mountainous terrain along the boarder it shares with Afghanistan. Pakistan denies this, but the ""intellegence"" knows better. Uh-huh. Yeah right! If the intellegence knows better, then where is Bin Laden? Where? Drinking a snapple and cuddling up to monica's velvet dress in the Lincoln bedroom perhaps? Like a buger! Right under Bushes nose (and not seen).<br /> </p>"

"event","I miss Furce everyday, but today I am missing him especially so. My heart is aching for him so much that the pain from it is radiating through my body like beams of sun or beams of light. But these are beams of pain. I ache with love and longing for him, and it's making me crazy! I wish I could act, but my hands are <em>completely</em> tied. There's nothing I can do except keep living everyday as though it were my last, and continuing to&nbsp; express my desires to God wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Today at work, I got a call. It was from a gent who's father came to see me in reference to him and his situation, last week. This gent K, made an appointment to see me. Strangely though, the call felt less like the setting of an appointment and more like the arranging of a&nbsp; secret romantic rendezvous with a stranger.<br /><br />I got off the phone, and noticed I felt that feeling that comes about when one is sexually attracted to someone they shouldn't, or don't want to be sexually attracted to. It's that feeling of flutter in the heart combined with sexual arousal, and accompanied by confusion in the head and burden in the body. I thought this might be another monkey wrench from God with regard to friendships. I cursed him up one side and down the other, even though I was not certain of this. How dare he allow someone (two someone's if you count L) to come in and trample in the garden! My garden! My love, loyalty and devotion to Furce! I have worked very hard to keep this garden tidy and just so! How dare he! God! And to send an old dude and a totally messed up kid?! How dare he! I might feel differently if he'd sent someone younger and with more going for himself. But he sent an old dude and a messed up kid - to trample on my garden - that I have worked so hard to build and maintain. I know they'll be lost causes, so why should I even allow them to set foot in my garden and trample. They'll just mess it up and then I'll have to rebuild!<br /><br />I thought about it after, and wondered if I could just tell these guys not to trample. I wonder if I can say, ""Look - you're welcome to go here, here and here - but don't even think about&nbsp; setting foot in my garden. Don't toil and tromple or mess with my love for another man."" I wonder if you can just tell someone to do that? Can you set boundaries with the emotions you choose to experience with someone? Also, I wonder too - if you are at a time in your life where you're desperate for friends, and a friend comes along that you don't like, feel comfortable with or trust, do you have to take them on just because they came into your life? Or can you cast them aside and wait for a more suitable friend to come? If you don't take a friend when they are sent to you, isn't that being ungrateful, and slapping God in the face?<br /><br />Speaking of God, my friend ? is a genius. We were talking earlier today about the new trend of turning to faith based organizations for support - monitary, physical or otherwise. Then ? asked me how I felt about that. Just then it dawned on me what we read the other night - that there is some sort of initiative in Missouri to make Christianity the ""official"" state religion. I put two and two together and realized that the recent trend of seeking faith based help, might be a means of ""catapulting the propaganda"" and slowly but surely coverting folks. I think mind control is heavily at work here, and in many, many other places. By the way, extra, extra! Read all about it! You can now get your ""plan B"" pills at Wal-mart. That will be especially convenient if you're living in the great state of South Dakota - starting now. Abortion ban anyone?<br />&nbsp;"

"event","Arg! I think I HATE Firefox! It gagged on&nbsp; my yahoo mail, just as I was about to send! And, I am preplexed by this new possibly budding friendship that's happening for me right now. It's with a man named L. He's about 60 I'd say, maybe 60+, and widowed. He works at the courthouse, and I see him on the MAX, usually when I'm downtown for something related to the DSAC. Every time we meet, we talk. I've been completely fine with that. Well, the other day he asked if he could call me sometime. I couldn't think of anything else to say besides ""no"", so I said ""sure"" and gave him my number. Oh no!

We saw each other last Monday, then again on Friday - and he has called me once since then. He asked if I wanted to go to a movie or something. To that I said, ""That's something we might could think about, yes."" But, I really wanted to say ""Hell fucking no"".

Maybe this isn't the case, but my first instinct is to think that this guy is trying to put the make on me. Old and creepy guys, or old creepy guys often have. Never can I get a guy that's young and hot. Well, not for any extended period of time anyway. 

That's a blow to my self esteem, when all I get are old and creepy or old creepy guys (and pedifiles) trying to put the make on me. 

I want Furce to come back! But unfortunately, that's not an option right now, so I have to think about how to get myself out of this. I guess the first thing to do is think about what I really want or would like. Truth be told, I am really just fine riding with this guy on the MAX once in a while and talking with him. And I feel like anything more would be ??? - creepy.&nbsp; It would feel like that time I dated that guy who was old enough to be my father and had kids that were older than me - not right.

Then, I just need to set my boundaries and go from there. Maybe one of my boundaries should be: I don't generally make myself free to answer questions like ""could I call you sometime?"". I don't know though. Gotta sleep on it.

This day was good. I got a slow start, and didn't get as much done as I wanted to, and could have, but that was my choice. I basically just did the laundry and went to the store. Oh! And I did read the stuff for the Long Term Care Manager Interviews tomorrow. They want someone from an advisory council to be there, and I'm it.

Got lots of cool things at the store - treated myself&nbsp; foodwise. Got strawberries, grapes, carrots, peppers, tomatoes, salad, sugar snap peas and good meat. Had a little bit of all of it for dinner. Thought of the times gimper and I used to eat together, and dreamed about Furce and I eating these things together while planning our life and our future. It's silly to be dreaming so much and so hard about something that is seemly over, and has been so for a long time. But, I can't help it. Dreaming about Furce and I is something I just naturally fall into. I dream about him and us, like I used to dream about my art."

"event","Today, I felt comparable to the way I imagine a bummed out paratrooper would feel after a much anticipated but botched day of jumping. I wanted to 'chute - I tried to 'chute, but instead I felt like I ended up stomping around a desolate airfield, feeling pissed off, aloof, tired, bummed, and dragging my chute, still strapped to my back, behind me like a big, floppy, cumbersome deflated balloon. Amazingly though, this did not make me feel sad. Instead it made me feel surreal and curious<em> </em>I guess?<br /> <br /> Woke up early this morning - at three. The toilet woke me up. I forgot to push the flush handle up, so the seal that keeps the water in, didn't get tight. So, it was leaking.&nbsp; I laid there for a little bit, remarking to my inner self how I had to make it a point to drink lots of water in the coming day, to rid my body of all the salt I had inadvertantly eaten the night before, that dehydrated me. Then I found myself thinking of my parents and Furce, and crying. How could my parents move away like they did? How could they abandon me? Didn't - <em>don't</em> I have enough of <em>something</em> for them to stick around? Am I <em>that</em> <em>insignificant</em> to them? And Furce - was the man I thought who was loving, sweet, kind and considerate - my friend, <em>really</em> a callus, uncaring and selfish abuser in disguise? Was I, unbeknownst to myself, <em>willingingly raped</em> for six months? Or, did he love me? Did he care? <em>At all</em>?! Or, does he care, and is he just confused and needing to grow?<em><br /> <br /> </em>Thinking of this made me want to put the butt of a shiny black gun up against my head, pull the trigger, and do away with myself.<br /> <br /> I wrestled physically and emotionally with these thoughts for a while. Then I remembered something I'd read about one of the characters in the bible, either David or Paul. I think it was David. He was in a situation where he had, almost more on his shoulders than he could bare. And he just asked God to help him carry that weight, and help him through the burden. Then I thought, ""Oh yeah? I can ask God to help carry my weight and help me get through <em>my own</em> burdensome time too. I forgot that!"" So, I asked him. I asked God to help me stop thinking those dark thoughts and about that shiney gun. Almost instantly the thoughts vanished, and I was able to go back to sleep.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> I woke up later around eight, just hoping to have a good day with nothing special. I got up, started the coffee, and wrote to God like usual. I remember remarking to myself how I was surprised and pleased by the morning sun. Just then it seemed, God dropped a present to me with shiny gold paper and ribbon down for me. The phone rang and it was JS. She called <em>just</em> to check in. I was <em>so happy</em> to hear from her! It was good to hear her voice, and it was good to talk. She is always such an inspiration and comfort for me. We talked about the latest happenings in each others lives, God, and my parents. She says she and ""I"" (her husband) received an email from my parents saying that they had sold the house in Nevada. I guess it included a picture of the ""sold"" on the realty sign, and the words, ""See! We did it!"" It was sent to a list. I probably got it too, but erased it. That's all my parents know how to send is forwarded email. They don't know how to send real letter<br /> <br /> JS and I came to the conclusion that my parents are being rude and smartass to everyone they know. Treating people they have known for years, and that have stuck by them through thick and thin, like shit! Suddenly my parents are ""better than"" and hoyty-toyty because they have this rediculous mansion of a house that's going to eventually kill them. It <em>will</em> be the source of their demise. They might as well just order their headstones and dig their graves in the front yard now.<br /> <br /> Anyway, the phone call from JS was great. It was a welcome change from the usual, and gave me good momentum to start the day. After we parted, I got dressed with the intention to pay the bills and then go out shopping. But, I ended up staying in - listening to podcasts on my new ""ipod radio"", experimenting with a new knitting stitch, and surfing the net. The latest episode of ""American Dissent Radio"" was good. Chris Chronan has started reading the beginning of a novel called ""Decrepiton"". To me, it's like a modern day ""Brave New World"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" or ""War of the Worlds"". REALLY good. I highly suggest downloading the podcast. :)<br /><br />""Signs of the Times was also good. I listened to an episode from a few weeks back called ""The Media Part 2"".&nbsp; It talked about how the media is controlled by a certain few people, and has been totally created and set up to create, influence and change our ways of thinking. Totally out there, and totally interesting. I recommend downloading that one too. <br />"

<p><strong>1. Have you written your will?<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>No. But I've written several notes for one.<br /></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>2. Would you rather be burried or cremated?<br /></strong></strong></p>
<p>I think i'd like to be burried. Cremation seems so final. If I was burried, that means I could ajust to my dying gradually. Also, I'd prefer the sting and pressure of dirt being thrown on top of me, and maggots crawling all over me, than I'd rather feel the heat and burn and hotness of fire burning me to death. </p>
<p><strong>3. What do you imagine your funeral to be like?</strong><br /></p>
<p>Small, intimate, fun and earthy - like me :) I'd want it to be outside, in a park, on a nice, maybe overcast and a little humid, spring, summer or fall day. I'd like everyone I like and love to wear pretty ""garden party"" clothes, gather there, talk and remember good and happy times. And these good and happy times don't necessarily have to have involved me. The whole point is, I just want people to feel good and happy inside, inspired and at gentle peace when they're there and once they leave. I want them to always have those feelings as a reference to remember. I also want them to have store bought cake with lots of frosting, and I want them to&nbsp; laugh, feel comfortable, and have a good time. I'd also like not to be forgotten, and I'd like for a prayer to be lead by a believing but non-denominational pastor or minister. I'd also like for connections to be made between people, and connections that have been broken to, at least, begin to be repaired.</p>
<p><strong>4. What would you like to be remembered for?</strong><br /></p>
<p>I'd say my presence, and all that I did...</p>
<p><strong>5. Do you believe in reincarnation?</strong><br /></p>

"event","Ah! Here I am home. Has the day stopped spinning yet? I don't think it will until it finally hits me that the weekend is here. That will be tomorrow around eleven in the a.m. Yes! :)

I plan to rest this weekend, but I have lots to do, so I'll work on that too. I have to pay the bills, go grocery shopping, and I may go hunting for a few more new clothes too. There are still some things I want to buy before spring and summer get here. I want to buy while I have the money. But then again, maybe I should wait for that bonus to come? That will be in next month's check.

Today was good and busy. Went to the ""Cancer Disparities"" conference this morning. I only went there to perform the skit, but I sort of kind of, but not really wished I'd stayed for the entire conference. I enjoyed what I saw very much. But, conferences, at least in my experience with them so far, are sort of like the business equivellant to a holiday dinner. They are always held at hotels - which have bad food.&nbsp; And the food and drink are always aplenty. Everyone I see is always eating or drinking one thing or another. And, all anyone who attends a conference does, is stand around, eat and talk, or sit and attend workshops. Well, they call them ""breakout sessions"" but they are really workshops in disguise). I've done that a few times, and all it does is make me feel pissed off, bored and tired.

Anyway, went to the conference, and then hauled ass back to ILR to facilitate the writing group. I hated it, but everyone else said it was OK. I think the group could be much stronger and much more interesting, but not quite sure how to do it, and if we have the resources to make it stronger. Besides, BQ asked me not to focus on the groups so much now anyway. I guess that's cool by me. 

Stayed late and talked to JP, AH, GG and PK. The bosses weren't in today and it was slow - so, we could do that. We stood around the front desk, ate jumbo Fireballs and gabbed. It was great. :)

Friends are slowly trickling in for me, which makes me feel happy and is very&nbsp; comforting. I didn't have anyone really, there for a time - about 4 or 5 months.&nbsp; That was very hard.&nbsp; I don't know that I have ever not had a friend while in the midst of experiencing a loss. I wonder how many of these friends I have now will eventually fall away, and I wonder how many will stick around. And, I wonder if any will be there for the long haul?

Went to the Apple Store after work. I picked up the least expensive of the less ghetto speaker systems for the ipod. That cost me $100. But, I'll only have one chord to deal with now instead of four. That will be cool.

Didn't read the news today, but I read it yesterday. I really think the US is getting ready to finalize their purchase of India. It will be a strategic move for the empire Bush will build. And then it will fall down, go boom, and all of the people in America will be homeless and in hell. But not to worry.&nbsp; I'm sure Bush will be sure to assure us that ""we are fully prepared"" - just like he did for Hurricane Katrina. Bastard!"

"event","Just wrote my friend JS. She sent me that little story that's going around the internet grapevine about the baby hippo who befriend's the tortoise, then forms a bond with it? <br /> <br /> I was telling JS about how things have been going in my life since we last exchanged notes. I said, ""My parents and family and I still have not spoken. That's OK by me - it's the way I think things are best to go considering. But even so, I'm feeling like I've experienced <em>such</em> a loss - a deep and devastating, to the core loss. No, actually, more like a devastating and tragic death."" Then I asked JS if it was OK to experience such feelings of loss, even though I myself was the one who wanted and requested the loss? <br /> <br /> Then I thought, on top of these feelings of loss, I also feel feelings of&nbsp; guilt - guilt for grieving over, and wanting to grieve over this loss - the loss of my parents, that I wanted and requested! How can I grieve and what right do I have to grieve over something I wanted and requested?! Isn't that selfish?<br /> <br /> I see now that I have spent the last six months trying to push the grief I feel over this loss of my parents away. I see that I've also been trying to push the feelings of&nbsp; loss away.&nbsp; I know that pushing things away and not dealing with them is not good. Because they just fester that way, and become worse. I know too that it's better to fix things (even though it may be hard and feel uncomfortable) so that I can move on and be more of the person I am meant to be. But, I don't even know where to begin or how to go about fixing&nbsp; my not feeling these feelings. Arg!<br /> <br /> Help please?! I'd like some, help. Please?<br /><br />Saw a pink dogwood today. It reminded me of JS's wedding, and made me think about how far we have come in our journey of friendship. High, Low, No, Low, then friends, then best friends again. She told me when she married I, that ""We are forever friends."" I thought she was lying! Because, does anybody really know what it means to be a friend, and to love a friend? Not many. Well, in my journey so far, what I have seen and experienced tells me that many people know what it means to be a friend, and they want to love a friend, but they don't want to put forth any <em>real</em> effort to <em>be</em> a friend. In my opinion, being a friend to someone is just like being involved in a marriage - it's hard work. Very hard. And, being a friend requires a lot of things that people don't want to be, especially for any length of time - patient, kind, understanding, willing and all that. And, in a friendship, there is growth and change. And growth and change are often times never easy. Most people just want quick - quick and happy all the time. I wonder what the world would be like and how we would feel if everything was quick and we were happy all the time? Hmmm? <br /> <br />"

"event","Ah! Home, house relatively cleaned, fed, belly full, and settled. On one hand, I'm glad about that, and on another I'm sad. And on another still I'm scared shitless. Yes, my being home and free does allow for me to settle, relax and rest after an extended and busy day - but it also leaves me feeling lonely, which makes me think - about Furce, the email I wrote and sent him in the middle of the night last night, that I am now (sort of) regretting doing, my parents, and the one and only message on my answering machine. It's been there for about a year. Furce left it. It says something about just having dinner with a beautiful woman, and feeling a connection that he couldn't explain. I haven't listened to that message since, I don't know when - but I still have it. I'm saving it for as long as I can or want to because it's the only thing of that sort that Furce ever gave me - besides an email he wrote before the break up.<br /><br />Thinking about&nbsp; these things as I find myself doing most of the time when I am home, makes me feel sad. So sad. And the memories, dreams and saddness they carry with them, plays like a record - over and over and over and over - and over and over and over. And over. And I'm left feeling as though I suddenly and traumatically lost everyone important in my life in one feld swoop all over again. And for what? And, was the what worth it? God says so. But I certainly don't feel like it's worth it now.<br /><br />Today was busy and bustling, and that was good. Woke up nauseous sick again, extremely nauseous sick. Stayed home an extra hour because of it. Got to work just in time for case review and this week's update from BQ. The more I listen to the things he tells us, the more I think just how effed up ILR really was under the leadership of SW. She didn't have a plan for anything! We were just basically flying by the seat of our non-profit pants, and trying to stay afloat. Things were such a joke before! No wonder we never got any money, and no wonder no one ever <em>really</em> took us seriously!<br /><br />Case review was alright, all except for the 10 minute droan session from RC. And that was fucking painful. She has a real talent for speaking very slowly and pausing for dramatic effect, and also dragging the simplest things out and out and out. It really sucks when you don't care about what she's talking about, and you want to get the show on the road.<br /><br />WRAP was today too. I think I found a possible romantic match for LW there, and I was asked to read at an upcoming reading too. I know I was just asked to read at this reading because they needed someone on the fly, but I felt honored to be asked just the same. Don't know if I will read an excerp from ""A Day In The Life Of Amelia ""Courtney"" Welles"" or ""Death and The Odd Man Out"" (or something like that). Maybe I'll post them here and let my friends decide?<br /><br />I see in the news today that The President has gone to India to shop for (or scope out) territory for future expansion of the empire. Sure, he and his entourage, and the press, say it is to ""improve economic ties"". But, we smarties and savy <em>Monopoly</em> players know better. You, GWB are preparing for expansion. You're getting ready to put hotels on another set of properties you own. Perhaps it's <em>Boardwalk</em> and <em>Parkplace</em>, or <em>Baltic</em> and <em>Meditaranian</em> Avenues? Either way, you're getting ready to put hotels on. Well, when you do, and when you find Bin Laden, make sure he has a suite in one OK? And, remember that ""family"" always gets the discount rate. <br /><br />I see also that China is cracking down on spitting in preparation for the Olympics.&nbsp; Apparently, people spitting and shooting snot in the streets is a big problem in Bejing. If one does any of these things there, they are fined a whopping $5. Now they are doing public service campaigns telling people how to spit and blow their nose properly. Haha!"

Although, I did wake up feeling nauseous sick, there was a southern warm and very wet rain, and I did - <em>do</em> feel fat, ugly, bloated, and like my clothes, my hair and most of myself are all wrong. If I didn't know any better, I'd swear I was pregnant. And, I feel like 33 is way too old to be living, and the pinnacle of my life (whatever that is or was) has come and gone. I feel as though I am destined to be a sad, angry and lonely gimp, and live the sad, angry, lonely gimp life, like SS, CS, LK, PG, and so many others I have known and seen, from here on out. I wanted - do want, much, much, <em>much</em> more and better for myself. I want Furce, the house, the life, the kids and the family.&nbsp; Where is that? Sometimes I think I want way more than someone in my position and circumstance has a right to ask for. <br /><br />Started keeping a journal at work today - logging everything I do. I figure this will be good since I have to log everything short of eating and peeing anyway. We'll see how long it (the journal) lasts.<br /><br />Spent my lunch hour hanging out and talking with&nbsp; KM and AH. We had a great time talking, laughing and gossiping about Mr. W and the other dork ""advocates"" we know. Then, I went back to my desk, ate pop tarts and a fireball, and worked til 2:30. And, I was too hot, and sweat&nbsp; <em>way&nbsp; too much</em>,&nbsp; which was embarrasing because it made me feel really uncomfortable and smell. This was not good. Not so much because I was working at ILR, but because I had a meeting with a big whig at the county at 3:00. I felt out of place enough as it was at this meeting because of the outfit I elected to wear (yesterdays cargo pants and a brightly colored t-shirt w/ a pick of a girl and the word ""Rocker"" on the front). I looked too young and too caj. Just the thought that I might have smelled on top of that was like adding insult to injury.<br /><br />Stopped at the mall after, had a Quarter Pounder, fries and a Coke from <em>McDonald's</em>, then went to the bling-bling store - <em>Claire's</em>. I was in the mood to buy a little bling, and have a love/hate relationship with <em>Claire's</em>. Today I hated them - was steaming mad at them,&nbsp; because they didn't have anything I was hoping to find. And as usual, I got no service from the get-go there. And when I did, they called me ""honey"". I hate it when a ""teener"" (as Joseph Cornell used to call them) or anyone my age calls me ""honey"". It's so degrading! I feel like that simple little word used in that context, makes everything I have worked so hard to build and become, topple in an instant.<br /><br />Anyway, I went to <em>Claire's</em>, drowned my sorrows in bling-bling, and settled for things that were OK, but that I didn't really want. I liked the ankle bracelets better than the bracelet I got for my wrist. Wish I could've gotten those for my wrist instead.

Then, something let go of it, and I ended up all twisted and tangled in the leash that I saw that it was. And for what? A retreat and a meeting?! Yes, a retreat and a meeting.<br /><br />The retreat was good. I liked it but didn't like it. It was too early, too long, and I wasn't ready for it - and it was a monkey wrench as far as time spent was concerned. But, I'm glad we all got together, and I'm glad we all had a chance to voice our concerns and brainstorm in the creation of a business plan for ILR with BQ. If he has anything to say about it, ILR will be great someday, great - one of the envy's of the non-profit neighborhood.<br /><br />The DSAC meeting was boring. I arrived in the middle of things, and it was agreed that I would chair after the break. But, I ended up not having to chair at all because of the direction the conversation went - just people bitching, moaning and voicing their concerns to a man who was really in no position to do anything about them, except relay the message to those higher up, <em>again</em>. This made me feel mad because I felt like we got nothing accomplished, and really, really, <em>really</em> wasted someone's time. <br /><br />LW also made me mad with her moaning and bitching, although she did it nicely.&nbsp; So did LR. Mr. W also made me mad with his arrogance and ""know-it-all"" attitude. I really, really, <em>really</em> wanted to haul off and punch him in the gut when we were doing introductions and he said ""R knows who I am"" instead of saying his name like the rest of us. Fucking prick!<br /><br />So, I was watching the news tonight and thinking, ""Why hasn't that hostage Jill Carroll been killed yet? If she's still alive, they have kept her for two months. Why? They killed the others within a week or two. Why is Jill Carroll still alive, and why were the others killed - and killed so violently? And, did that British&nbsp; woman die? If so, that rules out the fact that Jill Carroll is still alive because she's a woman.And why did they free Roury Carroll, that Irish journalist from <em>The Guardian</em>?""<br /><br />I am really paying attention to every blast, every bombing and every hostage taken in Iraq and the rest of the world now, as well as the reasons for it. It has pretty recently dawned on me that none of those things are done without very careful and calculated rhyme or reason. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that the terrorist orgs spend weeks, months and maybe years deciding who and how they will kidnap or bomb next. And it wouldn't surprise me if they ""attacked"" The White House someday. It's my belief that if any terrorist org wanted to do that, they would. Also, I wouldn't be surprised to hear that the U.S. is financing orgs like Al Qeada. And, George Bush knows exactly where Bin Laden is. Like I said in a previous entry, he probably spends his days in a White house bunker and his nights in the Lincoln bedroom, cuddling&nbsp; Monica Lewinsky's blue velvet dress as if it were his favorite pillow or blanket, and wishing he'd been the one who'd made that infamous stain. :)"

Bean cakes are my new favorite food. They're like gardenburgers, but made only with beans, seasoning  and a little flour -- so good. :-P

Went to SMYRC today to practice for the skit I'll be performing in at a health conference this coming Friday. SMYRC is a really cool place in a really cool part of town. It's a resource center for youth who are gay, lesbian, bi-sexual and transgender. When I saw the place, I felt very sorry inside that I was not able to meet and get to know any of the youth who call that place home. They must be very cool. :) Their place was decorated with a lot of color and filled with happy, interesting, comfortable and painful things - from art to furniture, to business to pleasure. It was all very cool and inspired me very much.

Was glad I went out today. If I had stayed home, I bet I'd have done nothing, and been ""dreamin' bout that shiny gun"" again. Being with myself and only me for as long as I am these days, is like listening to the banging trash cans of ""Stomp"" over and over and over again. Sometimes I really like it, and other times - most times, I really dread it. I swear! When I grow up,  something I never want to be is lonely - lonely to the bone, and lonely to the core. What's that supposed to do for you anyway - being lonely? How does being lonely for a prolonged period of time serve you and make you stronger?

Rode the #15. I like that bus line very much - lots of cool things to see. And what I do see feels like home. My favorite things to look at are the trees, and the houses on Belmont with unusual architectual features, like funky, clean and free, uneven A-line,  and curved at the bottom rooflines. I've been looking that up here on the internet and see that style of roof is reminiscent of cottage style homes. I was hoping Furce and I could and would have one of those rooflines, somewhere on the German style house we were making plans to build.

Anyway, I've decided that somewhere along the #15 or the #19 should be my home. Any time I ride either one of those buslines, I feel as though I am riding through home."

If there is a bridge between two people, and it's still standing strong and tall after being burned or bombed, pilfered and thwarted (especially continuously) then there's a good chance that the two people at either end of that bridge love each other, because they cared enough to act in ways that would keep the bridge in tact and strong.&nbsp; If two people didn't love each other, I don't think they'd do that. Instead, they'd let the bridge burn.<strong><br /><br />2) Is there a job you would do for free, and is it your current job?<br /></strong>As long as I loved and believed in anything I'd do it for free.

"event","Woke up around 7:30 today, but really didn't get started until around 1:00. I must've twisted my spiritual ankle (or ankles) this morning as I got out of bed, because the morning was bleh - yucky. I didn't feel well and I was down. I was missing Furce, feeling pissed off and disapointed at my family, and cried a couple of times. <br /><br />DM wrote me though. Getting a note from him made me feel better inside. I've known this man for probably two years, and in that time he has been <em>such</em> a friend. He's not around much, and we don't hang out lots, but when he's there, I feel like he's <em>really</em> there -&nbsp; present, asking questions, getting to know, and <em>really</em> caring. He told me once that he's not interested in me romantically. Which I'll admit I find very odd.&nbsp; I think, ""Why would a guy put such sincere effort at being a friend with a girl if he didn't like her in that way?"". I guess I think that maybe because it's something I've never seen (a guy being sincerely interested in a girl without wanting to eff her brains out).<br /><br />I guess that goes to show another way that sex or gender can create barriers - barriers that are really unnecessary when you think about it. I was thinking about this just the other day, when I met a person&nbsp; who's transgender. He and I are doing a skit together. In the practice, we were sharing our experiences with doctors and other health professionals.&nbsp; He told me some of his, and I couldn't believe it! My heart sunk to the bottom of my stomach, and stayed there. I thought, ""Who would want to hurt <em>you</em> that way? You're just a guy who happens to have women parts on your body. What's so big about that?""<br /><br />Anyway, hearing the story of this person, and thinking about my own experiences with the opposite sex,&nbsp; made me realize how many barriers exist for humans just because of one's sex, or the gender one is. And, it made me think that we (the human race) would be much better off if we thought of each other as beings, and not as being any sort of sex. If you think about it, when all is said and done, beings are what we all are,&nbsp; right?<br /><br />Took a shower and went to the store around two. A sandwhich and ridged tater chips were my incentive - and so was a walk to clear the head. Came home, ate, and worked on some things for work, ordered some silver rings off the internet, IM'ed another friend, read some news, and now I am here - writing. Did you hear -&nbsp; Don Knotts died?<br />"

"event","Home early from work today. Another comfortable day down. Worked, but didn't get much done. Didn't feel bad about it though because of the article I read this morning about American's working more, and seeming to get less done. It said that the technology that has been put in place to make our lives easier and more productive, has actually slowed us down. I believe that. Take the paperwork I am often so behind on (and brought home to finish over the weekend). After working at ILR for two years, I finally get a system down which allows me to get it relatively done, and relatively in on time ---------- and then we switch to doing our paperwork on the computer. And I'm behind again! God! I hate it! My biggest wish concerning that is that we could get data entry people on staff. That would save me so much damn time, and probably make the reports we need to do, look much better.

Also read an article about stress. It said that half of America only cares about managing stress, and women care about managing it more then men. And, we have a tendancy to manage our stress by doing things that are not constructive to our overall health - like overeating and not exercising. Reading that made me feel better. I still binge eat, even though I have to watch my portions and eat less. Food has always been one of my best friends. But, when I made the decision to get skinny, I really had to be assertive and set some firm boundaries with it - and my body too. I binged on some french fries from Genie's this afternoon.

Read ""the usual"" political news too, and saw an article that former Pittsburgh Steeler Lynne Swan is running for governor of P.A. (kewl!). And,&nbsp; the South Dakota legislature has passed an abortion ban bill. My question to that (I think) is, why? If people want to kill their babies, they will find a way, regardless of what the law says. Our commander in chief and his cronies do it all the time. Also, we (America) is not as stellar as one might think when it comes to caring, being humane, or saving lives. We are no better than any other country out there, that is defined, by us, America, as ""cruel"". I think the only thing we (America) do, is dress the cruelty up, put a spin on it,&nbsp; and try to hide it. Other countries don't do this, that I'm aware of anyway. Did you know that America rates 24th in the world for it's infant mortality rate?"

"event","Woke up feeling like I had an extremely broken heart today, and my mind was filled with thoughts of Furce. I must've had a dream about him and not remembered it upon waking. 

I thought this broken heart and thoughts of Furce I had, would make the day go bad. I know the morning felt extremely irratating, and the bus ride was painful. But, once I got to work, all those feelings disapated. I felt good to be there, happy to be in my cubicle, happy to be among friends and comfortable. I enjoyed working softly and steadily in the relative quiet that was the agency today. Even though I was interupted lots with things that I felt were trivial, I got lots of good work done. And, I enjoyed the rain, the quiet, the comfort, the coffee and the talks with AH, J and TPS."

"event","Whew! Am I home yet? Jeez! This has been a day! A whirling swirling day. I felt like a little plastic spinning thing - not quite a ball and not quite a sharp object - spinning crazily out of control, spitting little bits of water and making a slight zipping noise the whole time. 

It all started when I walked in the door. SR and her dog R were there, sans T.&nbsp; They and three others had come for the Healthy Lifestyles Workshop, which they thought was at ILR, but was really at the commission. I made the mistake of telling SR ""hello"". Then I heard, ""Stink, could you arrange my LIFT rides for the rest of the week?"" 

""Ssh"" I said - meaning to say ""sure"", but then I stopped myself once I'd realized what she'd asked. ""Could I what?"", I said. ""Could you arrange my LIFT rides for the rest of the week?""

I thought about this, and in the meantime watched the passion play that had began to ensue between SR, the other three people, and TPS. Impromptu passion plays often ensue in our lobby, especially when there are big events, confusion and any people with cognitive disabilities, mental illness, ADHD or ADD present. Oh! And those who love drama too. SR loves drama, as does PK.

I watched and thought. Then I said to SR, "" Why can't you arrange your own (damn) LIFT rides?"" She told me it was because she'd be gone all day, not near a telephone, and had to get her ride changes in by 5pm. 

Hearing this pissed me off because I had taken so much time to get my ass out of bed, get ready and haul myself to work, and she couldn't even arrange her own LIFT rides! It's not like she can't do it. She's just blind for Godsake!

Reluctantly, I agreed to help SR with what she wanted. This was only because it was too early, and I didn't feel like dropping the ball, the hammer or the sykle (sp?) or setting any boundaries. With that, I said to SR, ""I'll do that for you, but I need to get some information first. But, let me go put my stuff away (I hadn't even dropped off my bag or taken off my coat yet). Hang on. I'll be back in a flash.""

I left and went to put my coat away. That took all of two minutes. But, two minutes was enough for SR and the rest of the passion players to apparently make up they're minds as to what they were going to do, and leave! Arg! 35 minutes of my workday, wasted from the start. 

The rest of the day wasn't bad though - just busy. The passion play, check in with BQ, case review, a one-on-one meeting with BQ (in regard to Mr. W),&nbsp; the filling out of my timesheet, WRAP, a meeting with a consumer, then home. Then off to the pet store to buy medicine for Livie's ear, a swing by Sunny Hans to pick up dinner, then home - to eat yucky chinese food and wrestle with a cat while trying to put drops in her ears. Four in the left, and none in the rest. She's being sassy now, thinking I won't catch her. Little does she know. I'll get her, and kill those damn mites.

JB called too. We talked about my stepping down as chair of the DSAC. She say's she'll not allow me to do that. Then we discussed Mr. W and his ""shit fits"". She told me that I should not worry - that it will eventually blow over and things will be ""back to normal"" again soon enough. That made me feel better.&nbsp; And it made me feel good knowing that JB wouldn't allow me to step down as chair. Knowing that I was going to have to do that, made me feel sad. Since LW&nbsp; became vice chair, I have really enjoyed working with JB and MS. LW would like to think that she is my strongest supporter - but you know JB and MS are my strongest supporters. I'm chairing this council for them, and all the employees I saw walk out in frustration the day they ""had the meeting"" about the ""reorganization"" of DCHS. I'm doing this for those people, and the clients too - to make things better. 

I often think of RCB as I'm doing my work on the DSAC. She was my vice chair before LW. I miss her, and I miss her support and leadership finesse and skills very much. In fact, I often try to channel the spirit of her as I go about my business there. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

So, I see El Presidente and his ""entourage"" are up to their oh so stellar old tricks again - selling our ports to (as luck would have it) a company in an ""Arab"" country. 

Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for your incredible sense of timing. As usual, you are on the ball with this one - not!

Excuse me! Are you forgetting, have you forgotten that our country is currently ""at war"" in an Arab country? Do you know, and are you aware that, in your efforts to ""free a nation"" you have subconsciously been working to make this country hate Arab, and anything associated with it? NOW you're asking us to embrace arab to ""improve homeland security""! C'mon! Those two things don't go together, Arab and Homeland Security. Arabs are bad, and they kill - right?"

Actually, the plane I envisioned was white, on a dark wet runway, and taxi-ing with a coughing, sputtering engine, one broken and hurting wing, and a bent and thus malfunctioning propeller. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't fly for the life of me. I just kept taxi-ing in naucious sickness and the inability to calm down and think clearly. I had ants in my pants and&nbsp; couldn't work for the life of me. First, I thought it was because I was tired, and that time and a big creamy cup of coffee would help. That comforted me, but wasn't enough to do the trick that I was hoping for. Then, I thought maybe some walking around and intermittent chatting with some of my colleagues would do the trick. Nope. Lunch and a burger from Genie's? Huh-uh. A soda? Nope. More coffee. No way. Just biting the bullet and working despite my not wanting to? No to that one too. Three O'clock and a bus ride home? Yes indeedy. That was the trick I needed!<br /><br />I felt sick at work today, and&nbsp; it was tough. It was also just a tough and cloudy, drippy day. But, there was no rain. There was lots of bustle, and lots of people were there. The Christopher Reeve movie crew was back to shoot scenes for video #2, everyone came in for braille class, and S &amp; TR&nbsp; and their dog R were there with CU, and her dog S. JH was also there, which made things awkward for S &amp; TR. Apparently, JH is going around town, talking smack about S &amp;TR, saying things that aren't true, and stirring the pot. Because she's nosey. I spent not even five minutes with her, and she nosed my opinion of her (which I hadn't really formed yet) right out the door. Who's that? What's that? Why are they doing that? Just like a freakin' three year old. But she's 50, and supposedly ""normal"". <br /><br />Things were quiet after S, TR, CU and JH left. I was able to work, at least a little better then. I have a tough time when S, TR and CU come in, because they are adults, but have the energy of three year olds. They stay pretty much in one area, but their energy has a tendancy to overtake the whole place. And CU, we all love her and think she's the greatest. She has come very far in her hard and tough life. But, we all wish she'd shut the hell up sometimes. She talks way too much <em>thinking out loud</em>. Imagine Sally Brown, Charlie Brown's sister, with a leash in her hand, attached to a yellow labradore, and you have CU. She often, ""is going to have her yogurt now because her cab came too early before she could have breakfast, so all she could do was grab something. And a yogurt was easy and it was all she had and could grab before she could catch her cab - so she wouldn't be late so she could go in the kitchen, have her yogurt and eat her breakfast so her blood sugar wouldn't get low."" Gosh! Jesus Christ! Enough already!<br /><br />TS also dropped a bombshell on me. She told me that her daughter, sweet yet rambunctious little, wouldn't hurt a fly, C, her baby (13) who, four weeks ago had her tonsils taken&nbsp; out, then two weeks ago got beat up by some kids in the apartment complex where she lives, was sexually assaulted over the weekend. Raped. R A P E D - by a man with one very sharp fingernail, that went right into the start of the life line (ironically) of the palm of C's right hand. It was the thing that kept her from fighting harder then she did. The pain of that was almost more then she could bear. TS is a wreck. I've never seen her a wreck, and she's had some pretty heavy shit go down in her life. I didn't know what to do, so I just let her talked, listened and let her cry. Then I gave her a hug and held her comfortable and tight after. Doing this was hard, because we did it out in the open, and she didn't want anyone to know. My heart goes out to C and TS, and it also goes out to her fiance E, and their other children T, T, and C. May God give them the strength, courage and wisdom necessary to help them transition through this oh so difficult and challenging time."

"event","Slept short today and woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Livie, my cat made me do that, because of her itching and biting. That made this day a bust. Actually, instead of being a bust, today felt more like it was spiritually kinked. I'd planned to have a glorious and productive day (being responsible and taking care of chores) but I didn't do a thing I set my mind to - except the laundry. That was an absolute have to. 

Spend the afternoon frittering. I meant to do more in my frittering than I did, but was content to sit here and work more at revamping my journal. This time I shored up entry titles, and got rid of unnecessary clutter. I deleted all the entries that were just pointless blabber, and something to post. That wasn't much because I wanted to get rid of clutter while working to preserve the spirit and integrity of things. So, far, I only have August '05 done. I'll work on the rest of the months, as I have the time.

Also read some entries. I like doing that sometimes because it gives me a chance to see myself outside of me for a change. today I found myself to be quite witty, smart insightful and funny. I loved a lot of the things I wrote in reference to news of the day.

Speaking of news, I see that our hokus pokus president says America is on the verge of an energy breakthrough. This, he assures us, would ""startle"" most Americans. Hmmmm? Could this be because we'll be making nukies in ""an undisclosed location"" again? Perhaps Los Iran? Or RosRussia maybe? Didn't Bush promise tax credits to those parents who sent their kids to school to ""excel in math and science"" (i.e. become professional bomb makers). Let me see now - What is the formula for uranium - non enriched of course? Because, we only need it for energy, not bombs! Oh, were only making hybrid car batteries. I say that's code for ""We're getting into the suicide bomber business."" I can see the slogan now - ""Kill yourself today in your Chevrolet"". Haha! Not funny. But you know, I wouldn't be surprised. I also am not worried about Hamas as much as many others seem to be. Wouldn't that be odd if an organization known for brutal killing and violence, knew the trick to being diplomatic, and was instrumental in bringing about world peace?"

"event","Got a false start to this day, so nothing I had planned to happen really went through. Although, maybe it did. I really didn't want to go to LL's house, and I really didn't want to get up and do laundry. I did none of those things. Instead I slept late and frittered the morning away, just like I wanted. 

The frittering was great until about 2:00, when I started to feel restless, impatient and sad. The four walls of my apartment started driving me crazy then. So, after a shower, I forced myself to go out for a walk. I thought it would be cold, so I bundled. But, it was actually pretty nice out.

The walk was nice. I enjoyed it and was glad to have the space to do it. As I was going along, I thought about the many times during my growing up that I wished I could have taken a walk. I never could, because I lived on a small farm, isolated - about five miles away from civilization - I mean, the city. The closest thing I got to a walk was going out to play in the yard, or putting my braces on and walking up and down the driveway. God that hurt! I never liked to do it. When I would do it though, I'd always pray for blisters to form on my feet. Because that meant I could get out of having to walk. New braces were always a sure bet for that. And, the nastier the blisters were, the longer I could get out of things. So, I spent a lot of time during my growing up making blisters nasty.

I also thought about Gimper, and all the walks that he and I have been on. We had fun. :) And, I thought about Furce and the walks we went on. I wondered if he thinks about me when he goes on walks now. I also wondered what it would be like to walk in Furce's neighborhood across the river, and I dreamed about taking walks with Furce in the future - down the street where our house is, by the cul-de-sac, where the dogs run, the children play, and we are happy. :)

Got up this morning and did the usual - all except for the water and yoga, as I didn't feel like drinking or getting physically fit today. My mind was too preoccupied, and my body was protesting. 

Spent the early afternoon finishing the revamp on my journal here. Well, for the most part I'm done. I may make some clipping paths for my userpics and upload them again, but that I'll save for another day.

The rest of the afternoon, I worked on the satchel I started knitting during the SuperBowl. I made the braid for the tie today, which was cool. I never braided before, but found an internet site to learn  from, and quickly taught myself how. Now I want to braid anything I can get my hands on :)

Am cooking chicken now. Don't know what I'll do later yet. There's always the news to read, and movies and brit coms to watch. And there's laundry to sort. I've got to get up extra early and due that tomorrow, because I'm due at LL's house for lunch at 12:00.

My fish Truman still looks peaked, but seems to be feeling better. It's recently dawned on me that he likes for me to sit in front of his tank. Company for him I guess. So, I sit there and write, or eat or knit, and he comes over to sit with me. He cuddles up on these rocks I've got for him - just like a little kitty cat. So cute. :) 

The girls are doing better too. They like the sun, the fresh air, my bustling, and the music I've been playing. We've been talking to each other more too, which is great. Sometimes I forget what great little spirits and personalities my animals have."

"event","i just woke up about an hour ago. i spent the night with cassie, i love this gurl so much it's crzy. we just watched movies last nite and hung out with some friends for a little while. The big party starts today whenever we feel like actually going to it. I broke down yesterday and we had to puch the car up summer hill so then we could coast down the other side haha it was fukin great. then when the car got close to cassie's house i had to jump out cuz if we stopped the car wouldn't start bak up again, but i love my gurl so much that jumping out the car really didn't bother me. i just can't get over how much i love this gurl already it's really crzy."

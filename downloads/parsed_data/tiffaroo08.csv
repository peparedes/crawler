"event","Hey everyone..Im feelin kinda...I dont really know how Im feeling actually....its like I had a really busy Summer and I liked that....but it kinda makes me sad cuz me and JD have been datin almost the whole Summer...and we have only hung out with each other 2 times...I mean the reason for that is cuz he's grounded but I dont know I just miss him soooo much...I haven't talked to him since I got back from Scotland I just wish he would call me or something...but I guess he dont know Im back :( .I just really love JD and I wish me and him could see each other more often. I sometimes feel like Im just this horrible gf cuz me and JD were really happy when we dated the 1st time and I just ended it....and Im not really sure why.I just did it cuz like I remember a week before I broke up with him it was rafting...and me and him got into a fight there well he said something and it got me really upset and we were almost gonna break up but I told him I really didn't wanna break up...sooo I really dont understand how my brain works...Im not really sure what happened the 2nd time we dated...and then the 3rd time I think that one was kinda a mistake cuz thats when the whole Candise thing happened...and now its the 4th time but Im REALLY happy I had my doubts a lil at 1st but right now I just know JD is the one I wanna be with and I dont wanna lose  him again.

okay yeah I know that was A LOT of rambling but hey thats what I do best....

On other news I think Mandys mad at me...Im not really sure what the reason is....something bout me not telling her things...but really there isn't anything to tell I mean with the Mike thing...I wasn't planning on telling her...and then I was gonna tell her...but Chelo kinda told her..when she said she wouldn't so then of course Mandy got mad at me...and theres like NOTHING I can do about it its like I really wanna make things okay again...but Mandy wont tell me how...I just really want my friend back...she was really someone I could talk to  bout things and I could trust her not to say anything to anyone...but then I guess when I wasn't telling her things....that was when we weren't really talking to each other much cuz she wasn't on the computer much or I wasn't on the computer much and like when we would talk..the things that happeded to me when we didn't talk....it just wasn't really on my mind...but I swear on my life that if I could go back in time I would change that...I would remind myself bout everything I didn't tell Mandy...I think theres only 2 things...I think it was the Mike thing and the thing with Matt after we broke up...I think thats all....but I did eventually tell Mandy bout the Matt thing before anyone else said anything to her...I wish I could call her right now....but its kinda only 7am and Im pretty sure she's not up sooo yeah...I just really dont know what to do anymore...maybe when school starts I can earn Mandys friendship and trust back...but if I do earn it...Im gonna try my hardest not to lose it....well Im gonna go ttyl's byes

"event","okay well Mandy just did something in her LJ and it it was cute I mean I know some of this will be like repeating what Mandy said but hey I DONT CARE im special like that or thats what my mommy told me 

Mandy- Is someone I can like really talk to...I dont think I would be here if it wasn't for her...cuz I have gotten like seriously frickin mad and upset before and she was there trying to help me out.....like if something happens and I say I dont wanna talk bout it she says ""w/e"" then puts an away messege up and that ALWAYS makes me tell her cuz I dont want her to be mad at me and lately I have just been telling her cuz I know I can trust her shes my shrink like Im her shrink I just know when I have a problem I can talk to her....me and Mandy have guy problems A LOT and thats usually what we talk bout but sometimes it has to do with my dad or her mom or sis or brother or dad and we just get each other through the problems cuz we both hate seeing each other hurt like that...Mandy has been helping me with my JD issues lately cuz as you all know from like my past entries he cheated on me sooo everytime I get pissed bout that or extremely upset she trys to calm me down she can calm me down but she can never stop the hurt.....I can talk to Mandy bout anything and she wont hold it against me or tell anyone if I dont want her to thats why I love her so much and if I ever got into a fight she would be there holdin me back tellin me to calm down...Mandy is also a person I talk to at lunch we always seem to hang out at lunch....Mr. Parker thinks me and Mandy are weird but thats only cuz when were together...we kinda are lol...me and Mandy get mad at each other but we NEVER actually fight we get over it in like a few mins or if we just need a break we dont talk to each other for a day and the next day I usually appoligize and were all good! I LOVE YOU MANDY!

Sam-Is another person I can really talk to...I dont talk to her much on the computer but when we talk in person I can just really get what I want to say out and she usually can help but on the computer its kinda harder for her to help me lately me and her have talked bout the JD thing but we also like talk bout how schools going by soooo fast and that our friends are growing apart were not really anymore but like some of our friends are Sr.'s and its just sooo weird we seem to talk bout that a lot and just everything me and her have a story that im writing bout things she wouldn't like me to discuss sooo I wont but yeah I just love her I dont know what I would do without her either

Brit-I can talk to her bout things but I dont know sometimes depends on what it is I mean its just like that way that she would probably tell Dawn or Yessica things before she would tell me ya know...

Chelo- I can usually talk to her bout things I dont usually like everytrhing she says cuz in the end shes usually right like the whole Taylor thing that happened long time ago and yeah...Me and Chelo both kinda act the same were both like perverted in many ways lol we used to act like perverted together just playing round tho dont think nasty people come on lol but yeah I just dont know what I would do with out her...why?....cuz shes Chelo!

I dont know what I would do without any of my friends! i love them all sooo much Im sorry I didn't write as much for some of you my hands starting to hurt i'll ttyl's byes

"event","Hey everyone...i just read Mandys journal and it made me think....bout a lot of things....things she didn't even metion...like if i got hurt...who would be by my side.....who would be there for me.....or if i was emotionally hurt...who would be there talking me through it....like if my dad fucks up again like i know he still is but...who will be there to calm me down....theres been lots of times when i wanna hang out with certain friends and there busy doing other things sometimes i dont think our friends will last that long i mean i know i will be friends with them but i dont know it seems like all this friend stuff was really easy in 8th grade....like i wanna hang out with all my friends but....there out hangin out with everyone else or something and its like woah whats going on...were all growing up and growing apart and i dont know its crzy...i mean you have friends that wanna kill themself and you really dont want that to happen...you have friends that do drugs and get high a lot and then you just got friends that stab ya in the back or ignore you.....sometimes i just think i need to go to a real shrink and just let everything out cuz i have been like really stressed out and upset a lot lately...and i have also been happy and those emotions mixing together is REALLY not fun.....cuz if im actually doing something i can be all Like ""Woo Im Tiff!"" but if i sit down for on sec and think i get all upset again.....like on Sat. i had a fun time at the hayride i was hangin out with Brandon cuz i was babysittin him and yeah i was kinda happy then me and Brandon sat by the fire and he was throwing things in there and i was still okay then the tractor came back and we sat down in it and ui started thinking and i got upset...then we got to Laura's and we ended up talking bout Jd and she said something bout him having a gf and i was like ""oh really....oh well"" but thats not what i was feeling on the inside...on the inside it was more like *Oh My Bob What the Hell Oh My Bob i hate my life* and then we went home and i watched Degrassi and then went to bed and cried myself to sleep......my family well some of my family members like my aunts and uncles probably think im like a longer cuz when im at family parties i usually go sit down and think and yeah....unless i have a friend there with me and thrn its a lil okay......but then my dad he thinks im a fuckin slut on the computer he thinks i do A LOT of bad things on there cuz of an incident that happened like 4 yeahs ago...and i hate him for it cuz that happened soooo long ago and he STILL fucking does stuff like that and it pisses me off thats another reason why i want to go to a shrink cuz i cant talk to ANY adults bout my dad cuz he gets all frickin pissed off and *cries* i hate him soooo much......

on other news......me and Jd are getting really close i love him a lot but i'll have to write more later cuz that last thing i talked bout got me upset *cry* ttyl's byes

"event","Hey All im kinda happy but then i feel sad cuz like i want something soooo bad it makes me cry but i just cant have it things like that suck....i think if theres a person that you think bout be4 you fall asleep or whenever your just sitting and thinking then thats the person you should be with but sometimes the ppl are to scared they'll do something wrong but if someone loves you as much as they say they do then you dont think they would be able to do that....but hey i guess thats just how life is nowdays 

on other news im not gonna worry bout the whole dad thing cuz i was talking to my friend and she told me theres nothing else i can do cuz i have already told my mom bout it and she made the decision not to do anything sooo i have to respcet that...yeah it still pisses me off but what else can i do.......

on other other news me and Sam(grl) haven't hung out in like forever like i think the last time she came to my house was......i dont even know maybe the day we went to the concert....and also we haven't really hung out at school much either...shes been hangin out with Chelo a lot lately.....at school i guess i hang out with Mandy cuz me and her talk bout our lil problems sometimes i like sit in class and just think bout all my friends and think how much everyone has changed like in 3rd-5th grade Mandy was my BEST friend and then in 7th i considered Chelo my BEST friend and then in 8th Sam was like my BEST friend and last year Mandy pretty much was and in this year cuz i like can tell Mandy everything and she always helps me with my problems but then i was thinking all my friends are my best friends cuz theres certain things i can only tell that person and yeah i dont just have 1 best friend i have 6...but then lately i have been feeling like everyone is slowly splitting up i feel like slowly Brit,Dawn, and Yessica are like leavin the group....cuz its like they hang out with us but then they dont its weird i dont want us to split up i wish things could go back to how they were in 8th grade everyone and i mean everyone in our group were really close with each other we had more friend parties we hung out A LOT more as a whole and not just 2 ppl and we didn't let guys become more important haha thats not completely true we did have our moments with the b/f's haha but still if we had to choose between going out to a movie with our b/f or helping each other with a BIG problem we would be in the movie with our b/f...with our frinds all there listening to the problem LOL j/k no we would be helping our friend but now i think some of us would go to the movie and its been makin me like really upset wow i made this longer then what i thought well i g2g be4 i get myself even more upset ttyls byes

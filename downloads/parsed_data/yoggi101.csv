in my dream i was supposed to take a pill that would kill me. at frist i didn't want to because i was afraid that it would hurt. i dont know why i had changed my mind and decided to take it. i started to say goodbye to everyone, especially my dad(i think that i love him the most out of my parents)and i swallowed the pill. it knocked me out and got so relaxed. my body somehow didn't take it and i was begging for two so i can try it again. i really want to die."

"event","i don't remember what i wrote in my last journal. so i had to take a shit this morning and thought i should call kischa, well since i haven't talked to her in a while. i miss kischa so much. she's my bestfriend man! we were talking about all the shit that went down since the last time we talked. so this guy that she's liked since 7th grade and has never gone out with and has waited till her 1st year in college for has turned out to be gay. they were bestfriends for so long and he never told her and she always defended him throughout high school. 
she was telling me that since she moved out to the east for college that she has never seen so many black lesbians. i think it's hilarious because neither have i. her mothers birthday is today and asked me to call her and say happy birthday. i guess i will. her mom is the nicest black lady i've ever met.
so this is the point to which i come back to the room to lay down with showow. i get off the phone with kischa and lay down but i felt uncomfortable. i dont think that she wanted me to lay next to her. i dont know why but i just got that feeling. this is when i got up and came here to tell you what did because i dont think showow wants to hear it."

yesterday i was driveing down Rd. 102 on my way back home to davis. i was driving looking at the road in front of me and not paying attention to what was on the road. hell, i dont even think i was looking at the road, but more down to the steering wheel. when i finally  remembered that i was driving and should pay a little more attention. i looked up and seen a truck about three times the size of my little honda about ten feet in front of me charging head on, and the only thing that could come to mind was seeing my girlfriend asleep right before i left her to meet a professor to talk to her about my final paper. the sad thing was that i was literally five feet away from being smashed in a head on colision and i wasn't afraid to die. i dont know why it seems bad but it does. i guess it seems like im in a way taking advantage of life; although, i know im not and dont care for anyone to know. im not typing it for you to know but if you read it what can i say, its an online journal."

i talk to people all damn day at work. is that enough?
i dont think she understands the emotions of anxiety that i get. and she mad at me for that. why? because i dont tell her. i told her that i would, i promised. and i will. if she will read my journals then shell know. ill continue to write what i cant say. and there are a lot of things that i cant say and i can never think in order. 

all i want to know is how im going to get to work and school. i know that tomorrow ill have to ride my bike to work. and i have to leave at 4:20am to be early so they wont bitch at me."

last night she told me to go over when i get off of work. i did. we go to rent a movie and some thing to eat but while in the store she just left me. didnt even say that she was leaving. we go home and while watching the movie i see that she was fast asleep. for some reason i just felt unwanted there and uncomfortable. so back to what happened. at first i was eating and didnt want to chew in her ear so i was on the floor and when i was done she told me to go lay with her. i did then she moves away. then she was pulling on me to come to her and again i did. i was then thinking that i wasnt being rejected but just being nervous. i hear her crying and thought i should talk to her but i wasnt getting a response. i didnt know what to do because she would some come close but when i touched her she pulled a way. after a while of doing thatshe asked me why i dont talk to her. right before she asked me i was talking but not very loud, sort of a whisper, of things that were coming to mind. things that i would ask, comment about, the way she was feeling, what i was thinking. i wanted to ask her what was going through her mind. anything she was thinking about. then i was asking myself why i cant comfort her. why dont i know how. that i would be more than willing if she would just teach me. so those are some of the few things that i was whispering about. then thats when she asked me why i dont talk to her. it felt like my mouth was paralyzed. i started choking on my own words. i didnt know what to say thing that it might be wrong, hurt her more and couldnt carry on a convesation with little feedback. so then i figured that i should start about what i was thinking right then and there of how i can never think of something to say when im confronted with someone i care so much for. the conversation seemed to be going on.  then all of a sudden she told me to go to sleep. i pieced it together and what the whole thing was that she didnt want me there but i should be(thats two diff. things and i was confused) and since i was saying something right that i should just shut-up. i asked some more stuff and really got the hint that i really should just leave. then i thought id be real fucked up for me to leave so thats when i went to go lay on the floor. i took a pillow and lay on the floor then she started throwing her bears at my head but i dont think that she knew my head was there. i then moved so she wouldnt hit me and she called me to come lay with her again. i didnt know what the hell to doso i stood there. she left then came back with her sisters laptop did something then came and huged me. at that point i was mad. she made a commenton getting snot on the pillow so i moved to the corner and was going to sleep there. then she started say that she was sorry and my neck was starting to get stiff and i was really cold so i told her we should go lay on the bed. i was starting to cry but didnt want to because i was mad. then i dont know what happend. i just fell asleep and had another nightmare."

dude- my oldest sister, Charlene is her name, wants me to cut her hair. my mom said that she'd do it, but charlene told her no. 
charlene wants only me to do it because if i mess up then she can hit me(according to her). meaning if she lets:
                      my mom-she cant hit her
                      my little sister-alexis will end up dead, not hurt

"event","i totally love the gift my girlfriend bought me. it was a paintball gun and some gear. its awesome. soon as it gets a little warmer im going to take her with me to the fields to play. i love being with her. 
it was a couple of days ago, im sure it was, that we were together for two whole days, consistantly. man, usually i dont like that not even with most of my friends, but i can tolerate her. thats good. actually we spent most of last week together. but i think that i may be bugging her. 
my dad, mother and her g/f bought me some great stuff. they bought me a pillow for my chair, a bunch of new art supplies. oohhh...they bought me some waterpaint paper. uh huh. good stuff. my oldest sister got me some cute socks(really soft), and pants. my other older sister got me some pjs. i dont know why they're Simpsons. we used to watch it once in a while when we were younger...:hummm...uhh...no i dont get it:.
oh yeah my little turd sister got me a gift card to starbucks. even though i dont drink much coffee. it makes my head feel weird. i guess. 
i feel like shit because i didn't have a gift for my girlfriend last night when she gave me hers. but hers is on its way. for some reason i couldnt decide on what to get her. i was gonna get her the shoes she hella wants but the store didn't have her size and i couldnt find them at other shops. there were other things but i think she may be picky bout them. 
oh-by-gosh! so trisha got me the paintball stuff and she also made me a bear, but i forgot it when i came home this morning. its cute! it has a red heart on its butt."

"event","so last night i spent the night at my girlfriends house but on the way there i remembered that i had a final at oh 10 hours. i come home take my final, which was about half an hour. i come home to gab some things and wanted to change but my mom asked me to take some money to the bank and i said ok like a retard, but it's alright i guess, because i had to go to the same bank. then she asked me for a ride to some store up the street to buy some crap for my little sister. i take them to and from and head back to davis, because i was supposed to have lunch with my girlfriend. we grub on like two plates each of chinese food, The Great Wall of China II, it was called yes. when i went to pay the cutest little boy(bruce lee roy) was sitting on the counter, but he didn't want to come home with me. we itty off and went to a bunch of stores, went back to her house, and made some cookies(they tasted kind of weird). her friend Ele came over(to trishas house) to, i guess, bring trisha a poster.  trisha bought me a Fight Club poster while out in new york. we then started watching the movie I Robot. 

i hella knocked out after like 20 minutes or so  into the movie. the first time i woke up was to trisha was looking at me. the second time we were both asleep. the third i checked the time and her little brother taking the movie; and last but not least it was time for me to go home. i woke up and told her i had the strangest dream with her in it. she was all pissed off and mad at me in my dream. then she told me she had a dream that she was mad at me. the first part of my dream goes like so:
'trisha, priscilla and i go to pick up theresa from work. we all got off the car to look at the birds and whatever else was there. theresa came and we head back to the car except for trisha. we're in the car, i start it, and i see the cop, who had been sitting in his car, get out and walk toward where trisha was. so i get off my car to go get trisha and when i get there trisha was talking all angry with him and he seemed to be calm about things. finally we're in the car and she told me that the cop had been smacking her. i looked at her face and it was all red. i put my car in park, get out, grab my knife, ran over to where the cop was and just started slicing at his stomache.'
the second time she was mad at me(in my dream) was because i just left her in my house and was talking with my cousins and didn't introduce her.

doo...when i told her that i had a dream she was mad at me she said that SHE was mad at me in her dream too. it was crazy stuff."

"event","i was up early this morning for no apparent reason. everyone was asleep and no sound. i dont know whats been up with me lately. i talked to trisha last night. that was great but i miss her. i miss all my friends. everyone left town if you haven't read my journals. im home alone. not really because my family's here. they dont count though. most of them are always around. i decided to not move out to the bay with my sister because i thought id have a lack of money and all that jazz that goes with moving. well, she came last night and this morning we were talking about why im not moving after all. i was telling her the jazz and SHE TOLD ME NOW, after i decided not to, that i wasnt going to have to pay rent, and that i could move in still but i would have to sleep on the couch. i thought about moving again but id rather go in may. i have a feeling things will be better if i go then. oh! then my mom gave ME a list of rules to follow if i move out. shes paranoid. i swear!
the rules are as follows:
1. new car
2. no drugs
3. no drinking
4. call every night until im
5. comfortable or ok
6. study once or
7. twice a month(with jahova witnesses)
8. come home
9. for ""every"" holiday
10. no driving at night alone
11. a GOAL

exactly like that in that order and word for word. i got to itty off."

"event","dear god
i have a story to tell.
my life is going through somthing 
i imagine its something like hell.
i love someone
billions of rocks away
billions of seconds away 
i have a billion things to say
i have a billion things to do today.
dear god
why am i so depressed?
why are my feelings and emotions so mixed up?
why are they so unstable?
please forgive me for all the bad deeds
i may have done. i try to keep my
word, yet something manages to keep
them undone.
dear god
why do we hurt?
pain and morne for that
we wish we had.
why do we desire for things intangible?
why must evil rule for so long?
why do we forgive those who have
hurt us, yet still hurt?
truely is it supposed to satisfy 
us them or you?
we should forgive and forget. 
have love and peace.
no war, or anger, nor violence.
desires the root of all that
or is it not?
dear god.....?....
dear god
never really do i ask for things
but answers, yet hope to find them myself.
dear god
when will i see her?
will i ever see her?
does she see me?
do i see her?
is she five feet in front of me?
has she met me?
is she behind me?
is she in a different country?
dear god
i hang down in the water.
i hang my head down
to find my shadow of faith.
dreaming, i reach for her flesh.
instead, her heart i take in a flash.
oh, id be the last.
silence is what it'll be
if i put her to try to understand.
why is it so complicated?
in life all i try to be is a helping hand.
dear god
answers im not asking for me,
but to help someone
answer the problem of me.
if you will do this one last thing
nothing more will i ask of you.
dear god
i hope the answers come soon,
because my head is becoming
a place of doom.
this is the end of my story
i hope not to wake soon. 
my life is hell
and i have no time to myself
i go to school
and stand until the next day
my eyes burn
my hands feel fake
my heels ache
my legs shake
and my body is weak
no one knows my smiles are fake
and cheeks cold of tears.
dear god 
please forgive me for what i have done
we should forgive and forget
have love and peace
and shadows of faith
ive had my share
i should feel bad 
and i do
to be standing here in my place
no one more should i do bad to.
please forgive me."

"event","holy crap! peanutbutter, my cat(pb i call him), totally erased my whole journal. i dont even remember what i typed. i was at bel-air this morning to get somethin to grub on and the lady totally thought i was a dude. she said ""hi, can i help you sir?"" that was so wrong. thats the second time in my life being called a boy. yes, i have short hair, and thats what she said threw her off. but she apologized and all was ok. i didnt mind really. i thought i would mind but for an odd reason i didnt. i think its because ive come to be more comfortable with my homoness. 
i remember that i was telling of me moving to castro with my sister on december 18th. but i decided to wait until may. if i leave now ill be with only two grand to my name, no job and cant take my car. if i wait then ill have enough to get my own place, take my car and look for a job. besides my sister called this morning and asked if i was still moving in. i told her no that ill wait until may so that i have enough money and all that cal. i told trisha my plans about waiting to move out and she said that she's not going to move to new york if im staying here. i kind of thought that was kind of great. shes on her way to new york at the moment. shes went to see a friend for the break. ill be alright though. i have pb. one of the cats we went to get. he'll keep me company. i have to go now."

"event","where i left off at was when i started to get a fever. i was too damn tired to get my lazy ass out of bed and walk on my aching legs to get something to help and i didnt want to yell for my sister, who was a couple of rooms away, because my head was aching as well. i thought that just by talking my head would roll off, and yelling? oh no i was thinking it would do worse like blood would oozy out of all openings of the head and a time bomb would explode any second. walking was a no go and a yell was a no go too. i lay in agony. i get up at oh 7:30 hours the next morning to go to trisha like i told her i would. dressed i get and at her place at oh 9 hours. i still felt the same as i did through the night. i leave her and at work by 12:00pm. through out work until 9 pm that night things got worse. i was getting weaker and weaker by the minuets. i barely made it home because i wasnt weak enough to make it home. i get home and take some meds. slept with about 4 blankets and the heater on full blast. i guess i sweat it out because this morning i was feeling well and rested. i think it was also due that i ate seeming that i hadn't ate in some days. things are ok. i felt kind of bad flaking on my friends. it was supposed to be girls night out but i was just too sick. i wasnt the only flake either. theresa totally went off with her boyfriend, ed. 
i just realized some days ago it was, yes, that i would be all alone on my thanksgiving break. priscilla and tanaya would be in LA, theresa'll be with ed, kischa with her boy, anna with her family in winters i think, trisha in new york, most of my family down in fresno, etc. man, so many of my other friends will be anywhere but home. 
i dont know. ill figure i could go to the movies every night by myself and sit in the loner chair.
i got to go.later days."

off of work i get at oh 9 pm last night and thought i would call my girlfriend. and indeed i did. talk talk we do and i suggest i go over for the night. sure she says and we hang up at oh 10:30pm for me to take a shower and skippy over. out of the shower i was and on my way at 11 pm because she lives in the next town which is about 15 min away(having to drive in my old bucket). i get there oh 11:15 pm. as i pull up i call her to meet me out side. ring ring ring my phone was doing nine times. and in the parkinglot i wait for about 30 min. not once did she answer. (the reasoning for me waiting outside and for her to come out is because she lives with her mother and she wants her mother to know not that i would be the night.) i figure either her mother found out or she fell to sleep. off to home i drive with my head hung low and my heart broke and having the jazz that i took too long. home i am and it being oh 12:45 am while my phone is ring ring ringing. its her. her reason(s) i thought i should hear of her not answerings. she wants to know why my going over was being so long. tell her i do that i was there for a well 30 min and her not answering and me being cold(no heater) and the jazz that asleep she was. turns it does that my jazzies were all wrong and that her mother was online. so terrible she sounds and says she is. being the guppie i am for her i take off into the night fog(terrible night visoin) to go see."

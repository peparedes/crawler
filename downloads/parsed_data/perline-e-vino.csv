"event","<b>I have decided to make most of this journal Strangers Only.

I don't understand all these ""Friends Only"" journals. Strangers make the most interesting readers.

So...

If you are fairly certain you've never met me in real life, and you would for some reason like to read my journal, post here and I will, ironically, ""friend"" you.

If you think you might have once known me casually, I guess that's ok too.

If you think you might know me, but I haven't given you enough information for you to be certain who I am, well, give it a shot and we'll see.

The only other requirement is that you have a journal of your own that contains enough identifying information (i.e., city of residence) to convince me that I don't know you. </b>

edit: I changed the date because it was getting close to the bottom of the page. The commenters are not psychic."

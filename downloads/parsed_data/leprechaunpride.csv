"event","One of life's most cruel and twisted laws is that the worst of things can and will always happen to the best of people.

Scott, I barely knew you, and yet I am compelled to honor you. Smart, approachable, amicable. You didn't deserve it. I hope that the kid who did this to you will be tried as an adult and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I wish peace upon your family and friends.

Rest in peace, Scott. You will be sorely missed."

"event","Michael Titus graduated Jupiter High School two years ago. He has been in the army for seven months, and was stationed at Fort Benning, for airborne training. He was given a 4 day break that began last Friday. During his break, he either spent time with his family, or was with our battalion. He went with the drill team on Saturday to cheer us on, and he came to our picnic Sunday to hang out and share stories. Everybody knew Mike. Everybody liked Mike.

Today, the Colonel got a call from Mike's mother. Mike died on Monday while driving back to Fort Benning, as a result of a car accident. Everybody who knows Mike is devastated. Nobody could have foreseen what happened yesterday. He was only 20 years old.


From everyone at the Jupiter Warrior Battalion: Thank you, Mike. Rest in peace. We'll miss you.

definately entering in the 'Sunshine State Games'. woo. i could use a new blade.

this week is out last REAL week of school. it's just exams after this. that's weird.

ran a mile in gym. i detest running.

then fencing. beat up on the new ones. that never gets old.

and now i'm off to do something stupid. joy.

"event","today started with me waking up and feeling like i got into a fight with a really angry kangaroo. something must be up with the food at the golf club. i remember the morning after the military ball i felt sick. but that was a little worse. maybe i'm building up a resistance.

anyway, i took a shower, then slept some more. read all my old journal entries, then occupied myself until 5. went out to get some dinner and upgrade a couple free baseball tickets. 

dad and i went to rodger dean, and that was fun. we always end up having a good time there. AND i made 10 bucks. i always win when i bet against him at baseball.

and now i'm currently singing along to 'Smooth Criminal' and having a pretty good time doing it.

ahhhhh that's happy.

"event","went over to Ryan's this afternoon for practice. no practicing got done, but that's a given.

band banquet. pretty fun i guess. not really a dancing person, but i still found ways to embarrass myself. i'm so proud.

it was mostly a sad thing, though. reminded me of all the seniors leaving. everyone got up and did their little speeches. some were funny, most were pulling on everybodies heart strings (if that's how the phrase goes, i can't remember). attempted to dance. didn't look so good. but i did manage to get down at the end with that little running man thing. and a sloppy moon-walk. i need to practice that.


Jessica: wow. right when i get to know you, you go and leave on me. lol. i'm going to miss you, so visit often! FSU won't know what hit them.

Lindsay: thanks for the rose or tulip or whatever it is! i love ya!

Ryan: hooray for breakdancing! i'm giving you the title of 'Grand Master of Funk'. i don't know why. just be proud.

i feel a tear coming on. i hate mood swings. especially when they try and break my 4-year-or-however-much-it-was record.

'The Flame' by Cheap Trick is a really good song. listen to it if you ever get the chance.


this is stolen from a dear friend of mine. his name is Paulie Paulie Four Fingers and he has a shoulder problem. rock on, Paul.

We all have things about our friends that make us slightly envious. Not in a bad way, but in a ""Wow! I wish I had that person's hair, eyes, money, relationship, toe nails whatever.""

So tell me what about me makes you envy me, then post this in your LJ and see what makes me envious of you.

if you feel a strong urge to post anonymously, then do so.


i'm gonna go waste time.

FREAKING AMAZING

that was one of the best concerts i've been to. and it was only 20 bucks! i can't get over the radicalness of Billy Idol. i got a t-shirt :) i will be displaying it on monday.

anyway, i went to band 'practice'. actually, we got alot done. first we dicked around and listened to music, then Ryan played 'Santeria' and i figured out a snare part for it. then Brian showed up late and we were transposing music when i had to leave for Sunfest. cool stuff.

i just remembered that i'm doing a boating class tomorrow. i should sleep.






BILL-Y FREAK-ING I-DOL!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!

CONGRATULATIONS LINDSAY!!!!!! see, i KNEW you would make it. i'm so proud!

bio: DNA extraction lab. making necklaces and hanging our DNA from them. i feel like i'm being initiated into a cult.

from bio to weightlifting: Jessica tells me that i made assistant section leader. i was amused. Addison and i conversed about our stalker.

weightlifting: dead-lifted 210. pretty sure i get a t-shirt.

english: sub. did nothing. fun.

lunch: Lindsay pounced on me. didn't believe me when i said it was enjoyable. she told me she made drum major and i commenced to celebrate.

english: still did nothing.

ROTC: banged my head against a wall for several minutes. then spun a rifle.

now i get to do a big packet on factoring so that i might be able to go to Ryan's for practice. woo.

Nina, along with the drum circle, got robbed (i honestly didn't think the Wazoo's were that good). AND MR. SANZ SANG! i admire him. i don't think he's gonna live this one down though.

we played football today in ROTC. i love physical fridays. Doug plowed one of my defenders into the ground, and when i go to bump him off one of my guys, he whines at me. 'lay off man!'. i was soooooooo close to giving him push-ups. that was annoying.

a weekend without homework! wooooooooooooooooo!

good luck on your audition, Lindsay! you non-hug-giver.

i should go do something...OH WAIT!

IT'S EARTH DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i almost forgot! eeeeeeeee!

in honor of earth day, here's a song dealing with pollution in America, sung to the tune of what else, but 'America the Beautiful'.

'Oh beautiful
for smoggy skies,
for insecticided grain,
for strip mined mountain majesties,
above the asphalt plane.
America! America!
man sheds his waste on thee.

from sea to oily sea.'

BUT i'll be at the talent show. yay!

today went like this:

biology: read something about anti-bacterial soap. wtf?!

band: i guess we're playing in the spring concert? woo.

first half of geometry: took the first half of my test. easy :)

lunch: decided to sit with the cool people (Lindsay, Jessica, Brian). notice how i didn't mention Zach Rives. why? because he's an asshole. p.s. the car that you described can't go anywhere near that fast. get your facts right before you lie about them, dickhead.

'yeah, i got drunk before the homecoming parade, blah blah blah'. whatever. your ass was sober, i saw you. if you were even close to being that drunk, you couldn't have supported your tuba, and you would have been on the ground when the parade was over.

why don't girls like you, you ask? (he was seriously asking this in band). let's see. 

1) you're a chauvenist and a womanizer and you're proud to admit it! honestly, why on earth would you brag about stuff like that???

2) you smell HORRIBLE. 10 out of 10 peers agree. get your ass in a shower, you stink.

3) people sort of don't like it when you insult them on a regular basis. crazy, right?

ok, i'm not gonna say any more, i'm done with you. for now.

"event","i did my leadership audition today. i don't think i'll make it. he seems to dislike the fact that i'm an underclassman. and he's pressuring me to take the HIGHLY OVERPRICED lessons that Mrs. Sanz is offering. sorry dude, but if it's 20 bucks a half hour, it's not happening. 

but he said some really nice things about me (which boggled my mind) so that was cool.

i've been inducted into 'Death By Cable'! yesssssssss! we're practicing tomorrow. i'm excited.


courses i applied for next year:

AP biology
pre-AP english II
pre-AP world history
health/driver's ed
algebra II honors (ugggggg)
ROTC II
wind ensemble
french I (as a backup)

woo.

i was in charge of flag detail today and Cody bitched about me having a constituted position of authority, so I made him run. far. i love it!

wow, my room looks like a crime scene. i should go clean it. 'should' being the key word. later!"

1) Jessica! who as of yesterday was accepted into the FSU school of music, making me a very proud little armadillo. i'm soooo happy for you!

2) Pope Benedict XVI, who began his 'Popehood' today.

and

3) Troy, for getting suspended AGAIN!

if i have overlooked anybody for their achievements, please let me know so i can issue 'props' accordingly.


so Mr. Sanz signed me for wind ensemble...though when he hears me audition, i'll probably get sent to concert band.

i love Joe.

drill was fun. we did exhibition for about 30 minutes and then played football for the rest of the time. i got tackled twice. sorta like, rolled over on my neck. ow. Majuan tackled me into the little raised part of the field (we were playing in that little bowl shaped thing by the band room) and i landed on my shoulder and all 230 pounds of Majuan's bulk was on me. it was disturbing. i never EVER want to get that close to him again.

now i have grass stains in my shirt. sadness.

fencing tonight, and that means fresh meat :) that'll be great.

Jessica: that solo was awesome. the wind that was blowing gave it an awesome visual effect too. very cool.

Emily: ok.........you mean to tell me that you memorized that whole solo? that's insane. but quite impressive. definately worth a superior with distinction.

Mr. Sanz is hilarious. all you guard girls were awesome.

i could complain about the color guard, but i'm not going to.

back to the band though.

i had to leave after the last song and i definately owe some people hugs (TWO hugs for some people. you know who you are *shifts eyes*).

biology: Brian and I presented. everybody loved the powerpoint because we got it to play margaritaville through the whole presentation. it was beautiful.

weightlifting: worked out, messed around with jeff and paul and trevor and alex. fun stuff.

first half of english: new teacher loved my essay. said she was scared of me because i have my black belt and that i want to be a bounty hunter along with private investigating or being a detective. it was happy.

lunch: alex kydd + large amounts of alcohol + late night tv commercials = hilarity in mass quantities. poked Lindsay. saw Jessica (yay)!

second half of english: had an enjoyable discussion about 'Great Expectations'.

ROTC: watched yet another movie (chain reaction?). heard some things that made me happy. found out Sergeant Major was featured in a Tom Clancy book (radical)! got to be in charge of the flag detail (yessss). ate donuts.

it was a lovely day.

now i'm depressed and tired for no reason at all. how lame.

i sure do. i get a real kick out of them.

they actually think i'm afraid to die.

psshhh.

now on to something else.

well...nothing else, actually. nothing happened today. i said it was a good day in my last entry, but i guess that really wasn't true. it was just an average day i guess.

the best parts were the death threat, and of course, the following:

we were bringing in the flags in ROTC, and i'm just walking with the squad, everythings slow and normal. and then i see Lindsay walking across the courtyard. and being the weird ass that i am, i decided to follow her all stealth-like.

so she stops at one of those bench things and i'm about 30 feet away, and she's looking at a gecko in a bush, so i walk up right behind her so i'm like an inch away and put my head right next to hers and she didn't even notice! stood there for like a minute, then just as i was about to say something she moved again, so i tapped her on the shoe or something and she was all scared and stuff. it was amusing.

and i'm sure i sound like a dumbass and that a second grader could have explained that better than i did, but at this point, nothing really matters.

i get my math test back tomorrow. pray for me.

i'm gonna try and manipulate my sixth sense. worth a try, right?

i'm beginning to dislike the human species again. i guess nothing lasts forever.

because let me tell ya:

spinning a rifle is freaking hard.

at least for a guy like me. who up until now has only spun spaghetti onto a fork. and has difficulty with it.

i bring this up because the ROTC drill team is now doing exhibition drill. and sasha is teaching us! that's happy.

so she taught me a little basic spinny thing that i can embarrass myself with. but i spun it seven times once! and i was proud. then i could only do it two times. then three. then one. then i'd do something stupid and drop it.

i was trying to do some movement that turner was teaching with the 15 pound rifle, and the butt plate caught me on the side of my elbow sorta hard and it sorta hurt. oww.

but it's all good. 

pretty sure i did bad on my math test...the geometry honors department is satan.

somebody buy me! prices are negotiable! i'm well behaved and housebroken. i can even moonwalk (sorta). and i can escape from handcuffs (seriously, i pick the lock behind my back). it comes in handy.


so i was pressing the 'search for random journals' button, and i found this little bad boy:

post a comment stating something i don't know about you and something you want to know about me.


that should be fun, so if your bored or procrastinating like me, do it. that's an order. and you must carry it out because i'm in the army, therefore i have constituted authority over you, the civilian.

i guess i'm getting started on my math homework now? oh well."

what? i'm getting in touch with my feminine side.

actually, thats pretty true. i am a little darker though.

notice how there were no clarinets on that quiz? discrimination in it's highest form! and you know, a clarinet is sort of a dark instrument. i mean, it's black, and black is dark. and its sound can be a little eerie.

my friend and i were fencing last night, and nobody had gotten a touch in like, 5 minutes. and when that happens, for some reason you just automatically become enraged and you get a HUGE dose of power. for some reason, it happens to all fencers. but anyway, we really started going at it, and we both lunged and hit at the same time (i got him through the heart, and he got me in the floating rib cage somewhere). but his lunge was so powerful, that his blade broke. almost went through my jacket. pretty cool.

and thanks to everyone who commented last night! thanks to your love and me skipping my math homework, i feel alot better. stomach still hurts, but i can find some pepto somewhere.

hmm...semi-long entry. should probably end.

love to all"

feel

horrible.

mentally, physically, horrible.

i did a one and a half hour, non-stop fencing match yesterday because it was just me and another kid. i'm really sore. and now i feel really sick.

and i have a nice little hill of math homework that i didn't start yet.

as soon as i got home, i went to my room, tripped and fell on the floor, and stayed there. for 3 hours. sleeping. then i woke up, ate dinner, and slept on the floor for another hour. and i'm still tired.

cody's gonna get jumped soon. i can tell. and btw, my sixth sense was right. something weird DID happen on monday. i love that.

i lassoed kirk and hogtied him today. in the middle of the track. he couldn't move. it was great.

i think i had something else to say.............oh well.

i'm gonna sleep some more and neglect my math homework.

"event","you know, i think i'm getting over the emotional phase :D

can't say that i'll miss it.

so anyway, sergeant major is still out so we watched 'saving private ryan'. uggg that movie is dark. theres this one scene when their on the beach and this one guy lost his arm and he picked it up and ran away with it. it was actually kinda funny. then they switched to another guy whose intestines were all over the ground screaming for his mother. and that killed the mood.

though entertaining, it's a HUGE reality check and anyone who wants to join the army or any armed force for that matter needs to watch it. you don't think war is that bad until you see a man with half his face blown off choking on his internal organs. then your freaked the hell out.

so tonight i get to do alot of math homework. but at least there's fencing tonight.

well, i should go relax before i start the math. 

you guys rock,

and i'm dreading going back to school tomorrow. that's not new.


my bike is on its last legs i think. it broke down today when i was switching gears. as far as i can tell, its a broken derailer, a rusty chain, and some misaligned gears. something that i could fix easy, if it wasn't for the derailer.

wow, i'm really tired now.

my sixth sense tells me that something out of the ordinary will happen tonight or tomorrow. i wonder if it's right...

i should end this useless post so i can listen to music. yes. i need my music fix.

goodnight

"event","--> Write down 10 different lines that are intended for certain people. Dont tell anyone who they're for!

1) dude, you're one of the funniest guys i know. keep it up with the lacross and drumming and you'll be rich as hell, i know it.

2) you're kick-ass, and say exactly the right thing at the right time. CATCH ME!

3) learn how to be quiet, and shoot up some adderol every few hours, and you might be famous. but probably not. because you're loud. and thats annoying. and people don't like annoying people. thus, you won't become famous. unless you change. in which case you have a chance. and then you can be famous but get arrested for abusing adderol. so don't shoot up adderol like i said. but still learn how to be quiet. why the hell am i typing so much? it can't be too funny. i think i should move on.

4) you're awesome to be around, and have some great money making schemes. don't go to jail, because then me and chris won't have anybody to run with when we destroy trey's house.

5) verrrry good taste in colleges. such a fun conversation the other day.

6) you don't read this, but thanks for talking me into trying out for section leader. you should deeeefinately be a sergeant.

7) i didn't ditch you, so don't bitch about me. however, feel free to bitch about ryan all you want. haha

8) i can't wait for when you save the world from all the evil pollutors so i can say 'hey, i know her' and everybody else will say 'wow, isn't she the one who saved the world from all the evil pollutors' and i'll say 'yep'. that'll be cool.

i'm running out of people who read this, gah!

9) you're like a second mother, only closer to my age and shorter.

10) ha, you lost your shoe!


even though they're pretty lame and definately obvious, let's still try and guess what statement you are, because that makes it fun and less lame.

for some odd reason, i miss everyone. no clue why, just do. ehh.

i need to go make dinner.

(charmed against all of the Puff variety)

Hufflepuffs smell. They've got great oogly house colours and stupid bubbly eyes. I see now why I never talked to them before AND SHALL FURTHERMORE CONTINUE THE HABIT. Note to self: Never talk to Puffies any longer, dear. 

Though the one with the girly name I almost kicked down the stairs was alright. Or he WILL be if I ever get this chicken he's supposed to find me. He prolly should steal all sorts of things for me, SUCH FUN... He's not very good at falling, anyhow.

But all the rest of the Badgers can go rot in a mass of rotness. Even duller than the Birds they are, except NOT AS BRIGHT. Buy them all lightbulbs, is what they need, clear up their poor dim minds so they know not to throw scones or sandwiches at people. Methinks the Puffian room could do with a nice change of decor...

(/charm)

I've still got these wirey things I 'found'. They don't do anything in the slightest and am wondering whether or not to give them to one of those ridiculous 2nd years. P'raps they can exchange them for their otherwise daft BRAINSES.

Also, still have no Malfoy doll. Liiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeesl! 

Love your truly beloved and slightly absent, but no more!,
Ophelia Ballard (who doesn't acknowledge the <i>word</i> Puff any longer)"

Diary DEAR! light of mine eyes, ears, mouth etc,

Well what a <i>pleasant</i> week. That's the word for it. <i>Pleasant</i>. Hung about the Owlery for far longer than should be healthy. Really THOSE BIRDS ARE MAD. What with their molting and DROPPINGS I am shocked at the upkeep really and they're not even FRIENDLY. Full up school like this, <i>least</i> you expect is <i>friendly bleeding birds</i>.

Very satisfactory all in all. Got things done etc etc. Classes PAH. Who needs them? Kilpatrick can keep her stupid loafing teddy bears and play tiddlywinks with them for all I care. <i>Really</i>. I bet they molt too. In their free time. Nevermind they haven't the feathers THEY'VE GROWN THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THAT RIDICULOUS. Pshaw.

(charmed for people who won't get unduly upset by such events, YOU know)

The Gryffindor Common room is looking up these days. Rather nice change of decor I think. 

...Hope that Cohen boy doesn't weep all over Lovey, it took me near 10 minutes to snatch that scarf!

Oh and Preeeeston, your idea worked louds and MOUNDS of wonders, <i>by the by</i>.

(/charm)

I think I shall have some biscuits.

Most adoring and much sweeping of forelocks,
Ophelia BALLARD"

Dearest Hunk of Glued Together Paper,

This week has been <i>mad</i> and everyone in this bleeding castle has gone <i>mad</i> as a result. Gangly little 2nd year muggles... swinging their unwholesome FISTS around, <i>if you can imagine</i>. And of course the Gryffs are all nutters, no news there. Although, seemed to have grown a new fixation with VEGETABLES instead of NAMING THINGS. Not much of an improvement, I say. Need a good swift kick in the frontal lobal region thingy, <i>I say</i>.

Professor O'Dwyer has awfully nice tea.

Entry for Friday September 9th, 2005.

Fairest Diary in All the Wizarding World,

Fridays are faaaar too easy. Might as well skip transfiguration, as I am a genius in the making, or have ALREADY BEEN MADE. Turning gerbils into tea tins?! Kid, you! I can turn the damned gerbils into CRATES FULL OF NUBBY HATS IF I WANTED. I 'spect they'll be giving me a NEWT any day now...

Our lovely windows do shine nicely. The Lionses seem suitably angered for the most part, except someone <i>named</i> the bloody thing. Name a window? <i>Really</i>. The lack of brains and/or marbles in this learning establishment, I can not just about <i>fathom</i> it. The dingy ol' Badgers don't seem fluffed at all, on the other hand. Can not people <i>add</i>? But what do you expect from the do-goodies, what with their penchant for yellow and black. Oh the bumblebees. Well, at least Tinny Winnie McAdams has been got back at. Perhaps it's not enough, but now I've got me beatery stick there shall be beateryings. All in the thrall of good fair English game play I say!

<lj-cut text=""Remembered to be charmed for self..."">

Deary Liiry seems <i>awful</i> attentive. Muahaha.

</lj-cut>

Some well-meaning Cubby better retaliate soon. They're losing their touch. And I'm losing my much-practiced right-hook. Pbbft.

Love you until death take one of us... rather horribly,
Ophelia Ballard."

Entry for Wednesday September 7th, 2005.

Diary diary diary,

Hogwarts is the same, really, but <i>less so</i>. Third year is a'right so far, Care of Magical Creatures is <i>divine</i>, I say, carpe diem and all that. The dear furry nifflers are so dear dear deary dear. Too bad I lost mine, ah, but c'est la vie. Divination is also a packle of easiness, esp. since the professor believes anything and I do mean <i>anything</i>. Dusty globes and chipped tea cups do not a future make, but it is fun! so ha!

I composed a sonnet for Emilia. I think it is <i>rather</i> superb, and I shall singeth it forevermore. It <i>rhymes</i> and has <i>iambs</i>... among other things. It is dear sweet lovely.

And the Quidditch team! I've gotten on! As a beeeeaaater and I shall beateth <s>the mudbloods</s> the naughty naughty bludgers. <i>Naughty</i>.

We're having scones for breakfast and I'm making a scone fort. <i>Not</i> a silly babyish one, my scone fort is going to have fortifications and battlements and bloody snipers, for Merlin's sake! Nargh!

Love you and forever yours,
Ophelia Ballard."

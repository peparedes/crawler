"event","Ok so this is the first song (part of it) for my new CD
It's going to be number one and RAge Wrapped In Love will be number 2
Whatcha think? Oh yeah, It's called- All I Kknow

All I know is I messed up
Over reacted to your little stuff
I don't know when I don't know why
All I know is now I cry
Cause I'm the one behind your hopes a fears
I'm the one that sees your tears
Sing your song that I despise
Push me farther back in your mind
Deal with me and how you don't
Go ahead pretend I'm a joke
Play your games
Pretend I'm a dare
Humor me once though and show me you care

Cause I'm the one with your hopes and dreams
I'm the one that feels your needs
I'm the one that sings your songs
Thinkin' about you all day long
You warned me from the start but I wanted your heart
(2 more unfinished lines...)

All I know you messed up
Fell in love with my stupid stuff
Call me spunky, Call me your lady, Call me crazy
Just do me a favor and stop calling me baby
Cause you're the one that I despise
Everytime I look in your eyes
I see the things that use to be
Your iniciative, integrity
Now it's gone and I don't know where
All I know is this is unfair
YOU'RE BREATHIN NOW AND I'M SATISFIED
SO TURN YOUR HEAD AND WALK ON BY
You're through with me well I'm done with you
But unlike you my love was true
You're through with me so I'm done with you
But unlike you my loves still true

Cause I'm the one with your hopes and dreams
I'm the one that feels your needs
I'm the one that sings your songs
Thinkin' about you all day long
You warned me from the start but I wanted your heart
(2 more unfinished lines...)

You're through with me so Im done with you
But unlike you my loves still true

YAY Tiffany! I'm excited the CD's going to be good! (Bet ya can't figure out who the songs about...HAHA)

Cause I can barely breathe without you I hope you're satisfied
Ive been ripped awaty from my comfort and pride I hope youre satisfied
I see you so clear wrapped up in fear
Your reach is so long that it covers me like a decision I cannot deny
My luck runs out I wouldnt tell
No more time for words so remeber what you've heard 
No comfort No pride nothing left to hide

Yeah so this is exactly how I feel about Kevin...and he wrote the Goddamn thing, and now I have to sing it with him? It'll be hard not to sing it to him...and shove the words in his face. Maybe then he'll get how I feel about him.
That sucks

So I was in my car last night on the way to get food with Kevin at like 1am. The only CD's I had in my car were JC Chazes and Maria's Arcade (his band). After listening to JC for a bit I knew it was drving Kev crazy. So I tell him
""I'd change the CD but the only other thing I have in my car is your band...and you DON'T want to hear me singing to that at the top of my lungs!""
Well he then says that he's never heard anybody sing his songs before so I put the CD in.
And Im off being cheesy and singing at the top of my lungs.
In the middle of this I notice him watching me. So I look over at him and he tell me that I sound good and that I should sing with him. I laugh it off, because I've heard me in the shower singing and Im no good...I sound like poo....Anyone that has ever been in my car will agree with this!
Somehow or another he decides that I need to sing with him at his show on Monday...
RIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT This is rediculous for the following reasons:
1. I can't sing
2. I dont sing
3. I CAN'T SING!

Well long story short...Me being madly in love with him, AGREES to do it. So now I'm practicing with him on Sunday so we can perfect my perfect litle song
So I can sing with him at his show on Monday. HAHAHHA

Beauty.
A I am sitting on my private balcony of the most beautiful cruise ship ever
Staring at Florida
Watching it disapear into the sunset as the ship sails away.
It's 5:30, If I were at home I would be getting ready for work!
But no, I am sitting on my balcony smoking a cigarette, listening to Fefe Dobsom in utter amazement at the beauty at which I am seeing.
This is what I want to do...
Fuck the clothes I wear
Fuck Urban, Abercrombie, Dolce and Bebe.
Fuck the money that I waste on it all!
I own like 2 grand in jeans...JEANS ALONE!!!
Almost every month I buy at least one pair of jeans- at $130 a pop
HELLO!?!??!? Do you realize thats 2 cruises a year...JUST IF I STOP BUYING JEANS!!!
If I stop my shopping addiction and save- I could do this twice a year.
Am I ever going to remember the jeans/clothes I wear ten years from now?
Fuck no!
Am  I going to remember this moment?
Forever
Ive been on 10 cruises in the past 7 years, never paying for on- except this one.
I have never appriciated anything so mych in my life.
I just cant grasp the pure joy I am right now
My eyes are open for the first time in a long time
I feel so alive
So alone
So strong
So powerful
So real
So everything that I've denied myself until right now.
I am truly happy.
Fuck everything I've known till now
THIS...THIS IS ME"

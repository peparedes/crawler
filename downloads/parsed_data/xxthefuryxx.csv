"event","today at work i messed up. I woke up late, but thats not the bad part i had to wake up at somewhere around 4:50am in order to wake three clients up for TB testing. so they would have enough time to be ready to go at 5:15am. i woke up at the usual time at 5:25am in order to wake up the all the clients at 5:30. so my boss called me in to his office today and told me that he would like to keep me until i leave on June 26 they already have a replacement waiting and that if i mess up one more time i'll be fired and have to move earlier than anticipated that sucks. i f'ing hate my job everyone who works there is an idiot everyone there has so much shit on each others faces from kissing the boss' ass and his boss' ass its repulsive i see this go on and it makes me sick i want to vomit on all of them. why dont they get some self-respect anyway i hate my job my roommate smells he falls asleep with the TV on loud to drown out ""the voices"" god just give me some help to get by these next 46 days."

i saw my brother last weekend and that was cool i cant wait to move in with him and get out of this city.
i went deep sea fishing on saturday i got to see the beautiful brown los angeles air from a couple miles out i didnt catch annything edible which sucked but i did catch a poisonous fish that was decent size it was awesome on the way back the water got really wild the boat was rocking back and forth pretty violently and when youre sitting in the cabin breathing everyone elses funk its pretty easy to want to vomit so lets just say my name was RALPH for the trip back"

"event","this is my first journal entry im counting the days until im out of pasadena oh how i loath this city ive spent my whole life here and its wearing me thin i just turned twenty yeah hence the xx ny my name. a little history on me the last couple years have been interesting to say the least to start i was partying pretty hard and got into some trouble i alienated any of the friends i had so when the shit hit the fan so to speak i had one friend left he was in ""the program"" alcoholics anonymous so i decided to give it a shot granted i did what they suggest but i always had this feeling that everything they said was a bunch of crap but regardless i stayed ""clean and sober"" for like twenty months i either grew up, got wiser, or just opened my eyes but i just couldnt believe anymore of their crap so ive been drinking for the past two weeks not every day or getting drunk but having 2 to 3 beers and watching a movie or something like that but anyway i believe that the program of alcoholics anonymous tells you that youre different from the rest of the world that you have this disease bullshit its one thing if youve been slamming heroin or speed or smoking crack there you will find a disease because of what the chemicals do to youre body with alcohol there is no disease there is however one thing CHOICE the power to make decisions for yourself it comes down to the ability to make a choice am i going to drink today yes or no its that simple anyway that will about do it for me until next time."

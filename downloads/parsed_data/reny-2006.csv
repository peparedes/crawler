I think this will be a short entry considering really nothing has happened the past few days. 

Yesturday I stayed home because I was sick. So I stayed in bed till 9 then worked on homework till one and too a nap.  Went to the doctors at 2 and came home and worked on more homework from like 3:30 till 8. Then I watched CSI and went to bed! 

Today I woke up and went to school.  Had a test in psychology, which didn't turn out too bad I don't think.  And saw previews for the play, Everyone in it did well! I walked home w/ sarah! :-) then did something stupid and now I will go do homework and maybe make cookies! :-) Bye"

"event","OK so I just wrote my entry for monday and tuesday and then I pressed a key and it erased... So here it is again, somewhat the same hopefully.

Hello, 

So lets see what is new (haha sarah)... well monday I went to school.  I told people about my dream that I was pregnant that I had thanks to Andy who decided to tell everyone at school I was.  They thought it was funny I guess... I did too! But also scary.  Anyway school sucked then I came home a responded to a crappy email and did nothing.  couldn't really concentrate on anything cause it was just a really crappy day and yeah. But I did call spencer, that was a first lol.  But it was good becuase he made me laugh so it took my mind off things for a little bit :-). (I'm sure some people are assuming wrong assupmtions right now so let me just clear them up... me and him are just friends!) 

Then Tuesday I went to school again... Imagine that! whoo... today pretty much sucked too. Well its looking a little better now.  I walked home with sarah :-), that was fun! It made me feel better, it was the best part of my day I had had up until then.  Kinda hoping for something but didn't happen, oh well always tomorrow I suppose (I've been saying that for a week). Anyway :-) lol when I got home my aunt and uncle were here... SO i visited with them.  ALthough it mainly consisted of my memere telling them stories about me and my driving skills, or lack of driving skills lol.  And my uncle told me a joke.  He always has a new one, I'm not joking.  Everytime they come down I hear at LEAST one. SO I will share it although it wasn't extremely funny. 
     A blonde walks into a store and sees a display of thermoses.  So she goes over to the guy stacking them and says "" Excuse me sir, could you please tell me what a thermos is for"" He says, ""It keeps your hot things hot and your cold things cold."" The lady goes, ""oh that sounds helpful."" and she buys one.  The next day she brings it to work and has it sitting on her desk and the boss asks ""what do you have in your thermos?"" and she goes, ""A popsicle and some coffee.""
    HAHAH yeah i know not funny but anyway haha I laughed to be polite and then he told another but I can't remember.  But now I should go work on my stupid art project that I spent forever on and needs to be redone.  While i watch Gilmore Girls lol."

"event","Hello! 
 
This is my first Live Journal entry...It's kinda neat! Cassie said I should get one. Then she helped me make one :-) Thank you!

Ok lets see... Um we had a nice long four day weekend, I was happy.  Although I didn't do too much, but it was still fun.  Wednesday night I got my report card which I was happy about :-)  Then thursday I cleaned the house and helped my memere w/ the gutter! And then I had my doctors appointment at the hospital :-( Very depressing... no good news although it was less painful then expected :-) I have to go get a MRI done though.  Which is when you lay in a little tube thing for half a hour and hopefully they let you hear music lol. Friday I ran errands, I was supposed to see Patricia but I didn't get to :-(.  Then saturday and sunday I just hung out at home and worked on homework and did LOTS of driving.  BUT I am all done my hours!! So I can send my sheet thingy in and get my date.

Tomorrow I have to go to school.. so I should go get my homework finished and go to bed cause I'm tierd and my stomach hurts really bad for no apparent reason... But when doesn't it? 

Bye :-) 

P.S there is supposed to be a frog but I don't see it in the preview :-( so idk what happened... oh well I don't feel like figuring it out right now... Gotta go"

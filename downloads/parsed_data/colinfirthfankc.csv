Still trying to get everything loaded on new computer.  Don't have near the pictures of Colin that I used to, but at least now I can burn them for safe keeping!  LOL."

"event","God I'm tired.  Raked up four bags of leaves in my miniscule backyard and of all things the back of my thighs are sore.  Thighs, not shoulders or arms, thighs.  New one to me.  Never ending laundry to do tomorrow.  House is a complete mess, still haven't put up stuff from week of being out of town.  Why do today what you can put off till tomorrow???  Oh well, it will get done sooner or later."

"event","but I've been voting and voting and voting!!!  Multiple browsers haven't worked for me, but multiple accounts have.  I was voting on eight different accounts but that is very time consuming!
Even if Colin doesn't win, he's still the most attractive man in my eyes!"

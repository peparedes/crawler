"event","I'm extremely tired. Fun times. I've been living with Bulldog and J Scott for the past couple months while going to school. It's been pretty good stuff. Two of the strangest men I know. I've been bustin my ass in college just so I can keep my scholarship. It's been a bitch. Stupid boring Greek Myth class. I miss people in Terre Haute. I haven't been back there in over a month..goin on two months really. I've been rather ancy to do something cool lately. Something strange and different. My life is too routine for comfort right now. I'm not meant for routine. I miss Erin too. So very fuckin much. *sigh*

"event","I was told the other day that I needed to post more. I quit quite a long time ago. So...here is a post upon request. I'll probably just ramble. Anywho...Life has been blissful lately. I recently started seeing a wonderful guy named Bulldog. He is such a freakin sweetheart. And versatile. I don't think I've ever smiled so much or laughed. It's hardly ever a dull moment when he is around. I think a few people are upset with the amount of time I spend with him. But it's new...can you really blame me? I love being happy. Dreamlike bliss I tell you Dream Dream Dream....

I just read Kill's post about love letters...I must be the only one left who writes them...or letters for that matter. If you ever want one just send me your address and I'll write you one and mail it off. Letters are wonderful things. I wish I received them more. 

Glittering deep within one's eye is a joy that won't be suppressed. Nothing can bring me down right now sitting high and pretty on Cloud 9...glorious Cloud 9. It's strange being around so many positive attitudes...the negative ones can't even touch me right now. It's a nice switch. 

Denny's cheese Fries and Tarot readings. This is the life. Acoustic guitars, group singing, all at 3 in the morning...'mmm

Nothing highly contemplative or poetic from me today...I've been to busy living instead of contemplating...It's nice to finally give my mind a rest and just enjoy.

I love you and miss you all!!

*hugs and kisses*

"event","Well, I suppose it's time for a much needed update. Life is going alright. Seems as though I'm constantly busy, except for this drab day. I need to go shopping for the materials for my new painting, but I am just too lazy to do that right now. I happily love someone dearly right now. Almost seems too good to be true. I miss home more. I guess it hits in waves. I miss KT and Tangerine. We always end up having so much fun. And of course I miss Shaun. I'm counting days until this summer. Luckily I'm not depressed about being here. I have enough to occupy my time. My magazine isn't going to happen this year because of lack of time, and next year Lisa won't be here to be my photographer for it. Lisa is one kick ass chick. I guess Sara seems to think I'm mad at her, but I'm not. I guess we were both equally aggravated that day. Hope she talks to me soon. OH! I'm doing yoga now. Craziness. But it's fun none the less. Hurts but it's worth it. I'm aching to go on a road trip. I miss those days. Too bad people grow apart. I miss being naive. I miss the days when we thought that forever was achievable. Love to you all and happy wishes, even if you do hate me.  Love, Manda"

Suffocate me with your greasy greed filled fingertips. ahh just like that...Shudder, spine of ice glimmering. Breath visible in cold black blankness of mind. The breath of sanity but a faint glint. Then gone like the whisps of fog. Pure driven beats. Pound it out on the temple. pounding pounding pounding...

Humanity makes me fucking sick! Kill the fucking bastards. Watch the calm anger slowly bloom and flourish. The day I snap will be beautiful indeed. When I truly truly snap...

Take me home. I'm done with this. Lay me down within the soft, wet grass. Eyes forward and beautifully catatonic.

"event","Last night was very interesting indeed. I took way too much Coricidin. When it hit me, I was instantly gone into the deep levels of dementia. Luckily I have awesome friends. Erin snuck out of her house and into mine because she was worried. David did the same. Wil called me to talk to me until they got there. It took him forever to get me offline because I couldn't function long enough to do it. He called to check on me this morning too. However, as much as I thought I was going to die, I didn't. I did feel like the devil's puppet though. I couldn't control a damn thing I did. I know that's how it always is for me, but this was way different. All of my gestures were sexual. Even towards Erin, so I'm told. It was beautiful really. I shouldn't say that, but it was beautiful. To think 13 little pills can change a person into something so inhuman. It was like something out of the exorcist at one point. I was talking in hisses and such. My room was blue. I love when things are blue when I'm not in my own state of consciousness. The writhing and the beats of the music playing. all very exquisite. I should lay off tripping for a while though. I scared quite a few people last night. 

I met Chad's mom on Sunday in different news. She is one of the most amazing women I have ever met. She is awesome. I hope she liked me too. I also hope that I can see more of her. The memorial had an odd feel to it. It's something I can't put into words. His grave is the most kick ass though. I know that's trivial, but it's hard for me to talk about something of this nature. I normally just keep it all to myself. I'm glad I got to meet Melanie though. Really really super glad.

On the way home from the memorial, I ended up driving the rest of the way when Kelley couldn't anymore. I love that girl. Brahm and I ended up having an interesting conversation about how video games are a form of artificial intelligence. Quite interesting. 

Well, I think I""m done for now kids. I need to find out how I am going to waste the rest of my day. I love you all.

Mentally alert, you can outwit almost anyone (and have fun doing it!).

Very introspective, you can be silently critical of others.

You see yourself as a philosopher, and you take everything philosophically.

I have to admit that everything is pretty confusing, and I have been extremely busy, but everything is going great.  Thank you to all my friends who stick with me through the good and the bad.  I don't know what I would do without you. I've been getting more hours at work which is good.  I'm tired of being poor.  This past weekend Kelly, Kelley, Brahm and I went to Kokomo to see Terminal Stigma.  Kick ass band by the way. We stayed up there with Wil and Jini. They are getting married in less than two weeks! I'm happy for those kids.  Anywho, I also have been getting to see JR lately. I haven't really seen or talked to him in 2-3 years.  It's quite nice. I dyed my hair black...ramble ramble.  If you can't tell I just feel like typing random things I haven't updated on.  It's not like any one who reads this doesn't already know half of what I am typing. I feel like dancing tonight.  That's how freaking happy I am.  You know the best part?  I have no reason for my being happy....it's just because! Okay, I'm done wasting space.However, one suggestion to those of you with someone to kiss--eat a handful of skittles and then tongue them.  It is the most lovely taste in the world.  For those of you who have no one to kiss--go eat some skittles and kiss the next person you see that you wouldn't mind kissing.  They will so want you! ;-) Well my loves I will see you at the end of the rainbow while I'm counting out my pot of gold! Happy wish granting to you all!  I love you! --Manda"

"event","I'm am really tired of this.  It seems all I ever do is hurt people.  I don't even see how.  I do to an extent, but it's not like they weren't warned. I have the hardest time letting out how I really feel, and showing how I really feel.  No one can accept it either.  They might try, but they can never do it.  So, I guess I'll just go around hurting people...and quite frankly get hurt in the process.  I guess I have no room to be hurt though, since I don't have feelings.  I just abuse others.  I don't even see why half of you people even like me in the first place.  No matter... I shouldn't even care, since I apparently don't feel.  I'm am just a greedy individual out for herself.  I don't act out of fear. I just do it because I like all your pain.  I'm just an emotionally sadistic slut.  That's it.  Sound right?  I think not...but whatever...that's how I feel. I learned in my sociology class this simple phrase. "" I am who I think you think I am.""  Based on what some people tell me...this is what I am. They don't phrase it like that but that's the impression they give me about myself.  I bet I would be better off dead.  That isn't a suicide plea either.  I don't have the balls to kill myself. This is all just a bunch of stupid bullshit, but hey I put myself here.  Woo! Aren't feelings just wonderful...this is the kind of thing I always want to avoid.  This is why I shelter myself away.  I make you hurt...and in turn I hurt because you don't really see the truth, because I just can't give that to you now. I just can't. I don't even know how.  I can't sacrifice anything...especially after everything I sacrificed was taken by another. Get over it?  Go through it and then tell me to get over it.  I know you have hurt too. I'm not denying you that.  But you go ahead...become me. Step through my life from when I was a toddler...I know others have had it much much worse...but I only see things from my perspective.  I am but human and this is what I am limited to. You as well. It's something I can't give dear.  I feel like I'm no longer making sense, but feelings are irrational and usually irrational things never make sense.  Hope you enjoyed the fucking update."

"event","First off, I would like to say my previous post fucking ROCKS! Johnny fucking Depp.  How much better could it be?  

Anywho...now on to other things.  Erin went to Hawaii...how cool is that?  However, when she came back I was a happy camper because I got to hang out with my best friend quite a bit.  Which is just awesome! She also liked her birfday presents, which made me happy.

I am NOT excited about school, at all.  Mostly because I have to get up at 6:30 in the morning.  

I am actually quite angry at myself recently.  I have been feeling quite nostalgic lately, and I have discovered that I have lost quite a bit of my intelligence, as well as my desire to learn.  This thoroughly aggravates me.  I want to delve into some theories...recent ones...possibly on the state of society.  I need something to elevate my mind from this drab state it is currently in.  I hold no intelligence in my mind.  At least nothing up to date.  I'm out of the loop as one might say.  I am still intelligent, it's just hiding behind all the mindless drone of the day, which is sadly my fault for letting it happen.  That is why I'm angry at myself.

My college search isn't exactly going to well.  I have found two other colleges beside Washington University that interest me.  If anyone has any suggestions as to a college that might suit me, please let me know.  It would be greatly appreciated.

Other various news :  I'm pissed because mum won't let me get a facial piercing.  She's really going to be pissed when I turn 18 and get the nape of my neck pierced.  

Rumors are going around that Sean and I are fucking around.  For the record...We Are Not!  He might be fucking around with other people, but I am not one of them.  However, I have talked to him, but that's it.  So stop with the rumors damnit.

I went out with Sam tonight.  He's a sweetie.  We just went to Walmart and walked around, but it was fun nonetheless.  I think we are going to hang out again soon, hopefully. 

Things with the guy I really want to date are, well, confusing.  That's all they can be.  I just want him to be happy.

I still love Jon. So, don't think I've just forgotten about him.  He's one of the best friends a girl can have, and masseuse when in need. He is the absolute sweetest, and I would like to thank him for it, even though I am a bitch most of the time. I know I don't treat him like I should, but then I would just be living a lie, and to me that would be ten times worse.


Well, I think this was a sufficient update, so sorry if I bored any of you.

Much love,
Manda"

"event","OK...so it's been a while.  Uhm...nothing really exciting has been going on...like it ever does.  I've been on a big Tool and NIN kick lately.  I almost forgot how beautifully brilliant they can be.  Lately though, they have been making me feel quite nostalgic.  I miss those days when we used to party to shit like this and the nights I spent drowning in their music.  I've missed it like hell. 

Mostly my time is spent working or sleeping.  If not that I'm normally not home.  I don't like being home, if I'm awake.  However, I've been here for the past few nights.  It bothers me.  I need some enlightenment.  I feel I've been sucked into a meaningless hole that just drains me of any form of intelligence.  Funny that I haven't been doing drugs...it just doesn't make sense.

I had the weirdest dream the other night.  I think it was trying to tell me something.  However, the scariest part, even though I'm sure most would find other parts more terrifying, was that my tongue was cut off.  It was a rather interesting nightmare.  Inquire about it if you are really that interested, but I'm sure you aren't.  

College is becoming a difficult thing for me.  I want to go to Washington University, however, I was thinking about dabbling in interior design, for those of you who know me you know my room is my masterpiece.  Washington University, though, lacks a course in such a field.  That makes me question. I'll figure it out sometime.

I need to start exercising.  I love the fact that I'm curvy, but I don't want to jiggle.  I need to find a way to keep my curvaceousness and get toned.  What I really need is a personal trainer to tell me just how to do that, but that requires money, and a lot of it.  I don't have the money to spend on it.  I dunno...whatever.  I'm just unhappy with my appearance, but isn't everyone.  In the scheme of things...it really doesn't matter now does it?

Welp, I don't have anything of importance to talk about so I will quit wasting everyone's time with my mindless drivel.

Much much love,
Manda"

"event","Well, the week started off good. I went to St. Louis and fell in love with the college I visited.  I also met a beautiful Russian woman...she was my waitress.  Davorka.  However, coming home wasn't so great.  I came home to the news that a good friend of mine from 2nd grade to the 8th was killed in a car crash.  I am quite devastated.  Laura was a spectacular person.  We drifted when we came to high school but there were still many hello, how are you's, and smiles.  She will definitely be missed.  I'm still quite shocked...I guess reality won't sink in until her visitation, at which I am sure I will fall apart.  


Rest in Peace Laura...I love you girl, even though we drifted.

You can act quite<br>intelligent at one time, and grasp concepts<br>easily, while other times they can find it<br>difficult to understand. Twisted Souls are<br>always very fun and Kind, and can be party<br>animals.

"event","It seems it has been an eternity since I have typed in this thing.  I have had nothing to say, which actually I still don't.  I now have a job at Sandcut Grocery.  Fun Fun.  I have to work tonight.  I'm at school right now in my poetry class.  I love these days of nothingness.  I am going to remain abstinent.  I know, I know, laugh if you will, but I am serious this time.  I will not have sex until I am in a relationship.  I love sex, don't get me wrong.  That won't change, but I have become quite tired of everyone using me for one purpose.  I'm done with it.  I'm just lonely and I want someone to love, scarily enough.  I actually have a person in mind, but I don't see him liking me. I would be awesome if he did though.  The guy I'm in love with doesn't love me back so I must put those feelings back in their secluded cage.  It might not happen for awhile but oh well.

On other issues, I might get accepted into a summer art program.  I'm really excited about it.  It might clash with work though, which hopefully won't be a problem.  Mr. Turner actually said I had potential.  That is quite amazing.  I think I'm starting to become increasingly more focused on my work, which still needs a lot of help, but hey, I'll get there eventually.  I still have a lot to learn. I want to focus more on humans.  I really need a lot of improvement on that.  

Last night I did something quite relaxing.  I was laying in my room staring at my ceiling, listening to Megadeth, which I haven't done in a long ass time, and thought of absolutely nothing.  I was so happy that my mind was blank.  It was such a relief.  I wanted to play my bass so badly, but it wasn't enough to move me from my catatonic position.

Well, I'm getting bored with rambling on.  I will update again some other time.

                                                     Much Love,
                                                      Amanda"

Your phallus to me is so beautiful, 
  you see,
Tipped with an iridescent pearl.
Swallow it down,
Before I drown,
 in misguided misanthropy.
Take these feelings away.
Brutalize my every nerve.
Make me bleed,
  blood that seeps from my every pore.
Rape me of hurt, of love, of dreams,
  of every damn feeling to come.
Use me to the core.
Shove deep in,
  up to the hilt,
And make me believe,
I'm nothing more than a whore."

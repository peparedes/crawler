I don't talk to like any of my best friends anymore.

SERIOUSLY
I wish we NEVER left high school.  Ever!
We'd just do grade 12 over and over and over again

I miss them.

"event","Alright so the other day was my birthday. It was honestly one of the best i've ever had
So around 1 Breanne came over so she could have her car at my house and keep me company. 
Around 330 my grandpa came and picked us up and we headed to Original Joe's. 
I was scared to order a drink, but finally picked a really yummy one.
Then someone taps me on the shoulder and I turn around and Bob is there, and Matthew gives me a burrito. 
I was SO shocked to see him. 
So i was really really happy to see Bob, but I was also really really happy to see that Matt was actually there. So yeah.
Then Cassie couldn't find her way inside, so I went and got her. She ordered the same thing as me. So we all talked and drank.
Then I got cake
SOOOO good!
Me and Cassie enjoyed it alot. Its at my aunties still :( I wish it was at my house. I want to eat it. 
Then Carlin and Amanda get there and Carlin buys me a shot of tequila. (YUCK)
So anyways, i was scared, so other people joined me.
That made it better, but it was still nasty.
THEN
Carlin gets me a Muff Dive
So i waited for Cassie, cause I knew she'd like it
It was the weirdest/funnest thing i've ever done
so i got the shot. and then cassie ate my whipped cream  :P lol

so blah blah blah. we drank and ate more. Then we took a cab to Filthy's and there was a UFC thing going on.
And that was the funnest thing ever. Not.
So thankfully, it ended. I have no idea who won. But people left. so we sat down. and drank a little more
Kelton and MJ came, then Diana and Christina
Then Laura.
lol we fought. Then she bought me a shot. and we had a good time
So a little later we went to Dirty Pretty  and got into the VIP line cause it was my birthday!
It was fun.
But honestly, i have NO IDEA how people do that all the time. Even for an entire night
I'd get really bored.
Plus its way to loud to even talk to someone who is right next to you
So it was fun. But not for more then like 2 hours lol

So then we went home. Laura drove fast. Cassie was scared cause she doesn't like drivers. And Breanne was cause Laura well is new. and had been drinking
DON'T BLAME EM'
But i like fast drivers.  
So then we all went to bed, and in the morning Breanne set her alarm and went to church (lol)
then i woke up Cass and we ate, and then decided to get sweaters
I love my sweater!  :)

SO YEAH
Now i've just been packing cause i'm going to Nova Scotia tomorrow!
Can't wait"

"event","So i'm at my aunties now, and i LOVE it here.
Its good to get away from my house and being bored.

The other day I went to Kdays with Cassie, Vance, Ben, Shawn, Kyla and Danielle. It was alot of fun. The first ride we went on scared the crap out of me. 
The drop of fear or doom or whatever is my favorite ride, but the part where they leave you up there for so long was horrible lol. But it was fun. 
So yeah we went on rides, then went shopping, lost Danielle for a while and none of us seemed too concerned about it lol. Then we made fun of a bunch of little kids drawings of ETS buses. And Danielle came and found us again. 
We ate LOTS of food, watched this REALLY bad kid show thing. Kyla seemed to enjoy it though. 
Then I went home, and watched a movie and fell asleep. 
Then on Saturday I cleaned up, went and got food, then went to West Ed with Kelton and Henry. 
We went shopping. I helped Kelton pick out some clothes, wasn't going to buy anything and ended up buying a pair of 115.00 dollar jeans. They are nice :)
Then Kelton dropped me off, came up for a bit to wash his hair. I showed him about the place and he really liked it. His exact words were ""Chelsey if you ever inherit this place, i'm going to marry you. Man i'm gonna be a gold digger""
Then Kelton decided to play a fatherly role and wait so he could meet Cody.
Cody came, Kelton left and me and Cody just caught up
He left. I started watching Rush Hour 3, realized I had already seen it and went to bed.
Now i'm watching The Holiday  :), then i'm gonna go home so I can feed my cats."

We got to Marvel College and Diana started her hair. She had a shampoo cocktail or something lol.
Diana's hair took about an hour and half/ 2 hours.
Then I started. 
Cassie brought me chips and they were good.
Cassie left to find Vance, and I finished up my hair.
I really like it!  :) Its a nice change

Then I went to my mom's work and showed her my hair, and then went to Churchhill and met with Vance and Cassie. I had really good salmon, and this chocolate cake. Then this weird really rich chunk of chocolate :P
We left, and I went to fabutan. 
When i got home I was really tired, so I watched tv, read and went to bed.
My phone started ringing at like 130
and i answered it and breanne started talking, then Rory started talking
but i was like still sleeping so it was weird. 
I miss Breanne, and I definitely miss Rory :P
It was a short conversation cause I wasn't talking cause I was still half asleep
I got off the phone and went back to sleep

Today, i've been reading all day. And soon i'm gonna straighten my hair and pack for my aunts  :)
I can't wait for tomorrow and to be at my aunties.

"event","So, the other day, Laura and I went out for dinner to OPM. That definitely is one of my favorite restaurants and they have the yummiest chocolate cake EVER!
Anyways, so the guy that served us actually like offered me a job, and i've been debating it for the last couple days.
BUT I decided not to do it. Some reasons are because I don't dislike Old Navy and if I quit and hate OPM, i'm screwed, Old Navy is very laid back and at OPM i'd have to dress up everyday and be really nice to people, at Old Navy I can pretty much just ignore people if I wanted. 
Also, this job thing has started to make my mom and I fight about school and stuff.
So i think i'm gonna go to school, keep my job at Old Navy. And if/when I get a car and when I turn 18 i'll start looking for a new and better job!

I'm VERY excited to turn 18.

And now I'm on my way to ""BEERFEST"" lol. So I'm gonna get ready, figure out what kind of alcohol I want to bring because I'm not a huge fan of beer and yeah.
Should be fun. It'll be my first real south side party minus Laura's 18th in November. 
I'm excited to go out.

"event","So far my summer has been awesome. 
The other day Cassie, Vance, Greg and I all went to Body Worlds and it was really... interesting. The only part that was a little disturbing was allthe babies and yeah. 
So then we all went into the gift shop, and found diseases and greg bought a boomerang. 
We all went outside to wait for Barb and Greg threw this new boomerang and almost broke a car. It was funny. Thank God for that small pole in the way :P
So that night we all slept in the living room, Cassie fell asleep before all of us and then Vance and I confronted Greg about this addictions. 
In the morning we all got ready and headed to Lake Wabamun. It was really hot out that day, and the lake was perfect! We all had so much fun. 
Cassie and Jesse got really burnt.
After the lake me and Greg took a bus home, then we said our goodbyes cause he is in Grand Prairie for the summer (vance must be jealous)
I worked la la la
Yeseterday was ALOT of fun though.
I woke up really late and just lazed around, then Kelton called and I decided to go to the lake cause i didn't have any other plans.  So i took a bus to downtown and met up with Henry and Kelton. We met up in the middle of the road and kelton picked me up and carried me to safety. then we walked to the jeep and climbed it. the top was down so it was really windy.
We dropped Henry off at the Peacock household and then went to get Emily
We all went to Kelton's house and had a drink before going to the lake. 
The car ride there was really fun, we talked the whole way there.
We then let Kelton and his Dad put the boat in the water and me and Emily went to get changed. On the way there these guys fluttered their fingers at us, then nodded there heads. We later then realized that we pretty much just laughed in their faces. (sorry)
Anyways, we all got in the boat and i found out that Lake Wabamun is actually very big. 
Kelton and his Dad both jumped in the lake but us girls were too afraid. Then Kelton went tubbing.
Then me and Emily, Then Emily and Kelton. I find it soo hard to stay on with two people.
Then we stopped the boat and all jumped in the middle of the lake and swam for a while. 
Then i went tubbing and then fell off cause i was so tired. 
Lee then asked Kelton if he wanted to go wake boarding or knee boarding and i got REALLY excited cause knee boarding is my favorite. 
So kelton went first cause i was way to tired, and then i went
SO MUCH FUN
:) Made me extremely tired though, i could barely climb into the boat.
Then we just went cruising and ate pistachios.

on the way back to Edmonton i found out that places like Safeway and Save-on-foods have SECRET SHOPPERS. I seriously had no idea that they actually had those!
then we went to the ledg and had nothing to do afterwards so we went to a 24 hour McDonalds and ate then Kelton drove me the rest of the way home
I had a good sleep, and now i'm very very sore.

:)
Its been a great summer so far!"

Then eventually kelton came, and Danny jumped over top of me. Then brendan came and jumped on Kelton.
We then took Brendan home and me and Kelton went for breakfast and then to get paint.
The guy helping us was realllllllly awkward. I didn't like it. so we bought the paint stuff and we were really excited.
A few hours later we were done, and his room looks nice, and we both have alot of paint on us. 
We cleaned everything us, and painted the sidewalk by accident.
Kelton showered forever cause the paint was stuck on him
and i had to take the bus home with a diseased looking arm and feet.

When i got home i SCRUBBED my legs, feet, and arm with a puma stone. My skin got very raw, and i still have paint on my legs and feet.. and arm
Then i made my way to fabutan and was stuck in bus shelter when it poured and thundered and lighteninged. 
I'm very scared of thunder and lightening so i was afraid. BUT i ate lots of blueberries and that made me happy
Anyways, i got to fabutan, talked to Laura, tanned. Then me and Laura went to Starbucks, but it was closed.
We talked and found different coffee
Now i'm home and about to shower for the first time without a cast!!!

so I actually believe that i'm getting fed up with you ( both of you )
Lets start with #1

We have had this retarded relationship for like a year now. On off, on off. And i'm reallllllly sick of it. I have no idea what it is that attracts me so much too you. But you seriously treat me like crap. You treat me all prefect when we are together, but thats the part of our relationship that sucks, is the the part when we aren't together. 
Seriously, the text you sent me that said ""you know you want me, just admit it"" made me realize that you think i'm like in love with you. and that is definitely got to change.
I want my life back. 
I hate wanting to call you or hang out with you.
UGH
you suck

#2
You really need to start learning to deal with your problems missy. I'm sick of dealing with the same situation like every single month. Nothing ever changes, and that is definitely our problem.
You are an adult now, and you need to stand on your own two feet. People are not always going to cater to your every needs in hopes that it will make you happy.
I do love you alot, but i just see alot of effort being put in by me and not a whole lot coming from you.
You always blame the fact that we gang up on you, but we don't
we just share the same opinion on the same situation ( cause it happens ever so often)


People suck. I can't wait to kept the few really good friend i have and then make brand new ones.
WHICH YES. will bring drama
but it will be new
and not this same old crap

i'm very bored of life at the moment. Nothing exciting happens"

"event","<p>i hate this<br />i wish we never started talking<br />UGH<br /><br />Anyways my weekend was pretty good, me and Laura went to this party on the West End. It was more like a bunch of people hanging out. But i still had fun. I was ""reunited"" with someone I went to kindergarden with. He looks like he is like 30, but he's not. So me and Laura were in the cab home and she's like want to go to a hotel party, but i said no. Then her and her boyfriend fought cause she didn't go. Man, I wish that girl would find a normal human being. She doesn't even know what she could get.&nbsp;<br />A surprising thing happened the other day though, i went over to Laura's cause there was a fire in my apartment and there was a bag of stuff in front of her door and a peice of paper inside it said Laura.&nbsp;<br />So i call Laura and i look inside the bag and it was the rest of her stuff that Tanya must have dropped off. So Laura got all of her dancing stuff back, so she was happy.&nbsp;<br />And brittany stole a bunch of Jim's wedding rings and things. He is pissed.&nbsp;<br />I really feel bad for that family.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then on Saturday night me and kahlei went to a movie. We saw August Rush&nbsp; :) It was so good&nbsp;<br />Then I went home and read a little bit, then went to bed. Then my brother texted me at like 5:30 this morning. I twas like wtf. all it said was ""Hey, What's up? :)""<br />He is the weridest person ever.&nbsp;<br />Today was a very relaxed day,&nbsp;i should study bio, BUT i don't really know where my text book is....mmm hopefully its at school<br />I definelty gotta write my genetics test like tomorrow<br /><br />and i need to go christmas shopping.. right away&nbsp; :D<br /><br /></p>"

I don't remember what i did on Friday, so it was probably nothing&nbsp; :P<br />But on Saturday my mother an I went to Bear's and I got my belly button pierced!<br />I was pretty nervous when I was in the room with Holland. It took quite a while to get where she was going to pierce it right, but then I watched her get the needle ready. Then i realized i was watching her and stopped, cause it made me scared&nbsp; :P<br />breath in breath out. DONE<br />i like that it is so fast<br />but after the needle is done, she still needs to put the earring in, and that part hurts as well<br />BUT i was happy, and we left<br />It was such a gloomy day, so i was glad to be at home<br />I was supposed to hang out with Cody, but we can never seem to get together<br />So when the weather nicened i went out for a run. and might i say i was really proud. i ran the farthest i have ever withough walking.&nbsp;<br />then went straight into the shower, then got out got ready kinda. and went to OIive Garden at like 9:00<br />By the time we got in&nbsp; it was probably 9:45 and we ate LOTS<br />we had the yummy salad and then Jim ordered calamari and some other stuff.&nbsp;<br />Then we ordered our real food. By the time the realy food got there, the restaruant was closed.<br />We only ate a little bit&nbsp; becasue we were all so full.<br />Got home and wet to bed<br />then in the morning my tv broke ( i was upset) but then i went to west ed with kahlei and cassie<br />it was fun<br />i liked when we were in Forever 21. We all tryed on REALLY nice clothes.<br />Then we shopped some more then went and ate at her aunts<br />it was really yummy<br />They have the fattest cat on this planet. serioulsy, that thing should be put in a museum<br />and i realy like Badgly. he was fun, the others were boring<br />pierre was really nice&nbsp; :)<br />WE PLAYED WII<br />kahlei was really good<br />i'm okay. but ITS SO FUN<br />theni wnet home and shoed my mom my clothes<br /><br />I SLEPT IN TODAY<br />and that wouldn't have been a problem, BUT all the busses were wonky<br />so i was late by abotu an hour<br />but when i got there, no body has started anything,and they were like meh whatever.&nbsp;<br />becsue allthe bosses are on holidays<br />i was like SWEET<br />and the mroing was really relaxing, we took a really long break.&nbsp;<br />then the afternoon went by really fast<br />Sara bought us both ice caps at lunch ( first of the summer)<br />then Sara drove me home<br />shes nice<br /><br />NOW&nbsp;<br />i'mhungry<br /><br />/the end</p>"

Today was a pretty good day though, it went by really fast. In the afternoon Mandy and I did Horticulture on SCU side and this man Walter wasn't allowed to come outside and help so the nurse was telling me that he had a seizuire this morning and they thought that they were going to lose him this morining. hes such a happy man, hes so cute
Then i did program planning with Mandy and i went back into SCU and then when me and Insaf were leaving a stretcher was being upulled into the building for Walter. I hope he is okay.&nbsp;&nbsp; :(
But then i caught my bus and this guy was on the phone all the way from southgate to when i got off of the 63 talking to this girl. I honelsty don't think he ever stopped talking for more than one minute. I found it really funny becasue i was thinking that the perosn talking to him must have been pretty bored.&nbsp; :)
Theni got home and my mom called.&nbsp;
She got her tatoo. Shes really happy!!
And now i'm just waiting until like 8-830ish so i can go to a movie with Kelton and Breandan

Its been a long time since i've written in this so i'll start from last weekend at the farm
Me and my mom woke up pretty early and showered and then headed to the middle of nowhere. But first we filled up on gas and got breakfast and coffee. I filled up the car with gas for the first time. It wasn't as exciting as i thought it was gonna be. 
So anyways, we finally go to the farm and everyone was really happy to see us. Lots of people didn't recongnize me. Then my mom showed off my portfolio cause shes a loser and i got embarrased. Then i went into the woods and got lots of fire wood. then we dragged them up to where all the other wood was and then i decided to go with my auntie and cousins and grandma to get more fire wood. It was fun until i caught the log wrong and broke my finger.&nbsp;
BUT i decided not to tell anyone and kept helping and by the time i told people my finger was literally 4 times the regular size
So Jason taped my fingers together because i was laughing and he thought it wasn't broken
then i didn't go get more wood, i went dirt&nbsp; biking!
it was soooooooooo much fun
Me and my Grandma were playing soccer on the dirt bikes
Then more stuff happened we all ate and drank and talked and it was lots of fun
In the morning everyone got up too late so we didn't have time to prepare breakfast before we went to the cemetary.&nbsp;
So we all went and buried Uncle Vic's ashes then went back tothe farm
it was realllly nice out so everyone was playing horse shoes and things like that
Me and Alex went dirtbiking and i manages to find the biggest puddle ever. the dirt bike tipped over inthe middle and i fell in the water
i then changed and warmedup by the fire.
we all had a very good night with a humungus dinner!
in the morning i really wasn't feeling well so we said short goodbyes and headed home!

the week was really good&nbsp; ( I DID A MATH TEST )

This weekend was really good aswell!
on thursday i went over to cassie's house and was alone in her house for a while. it was funny
then me and cassie played garage band and i was a pro at it
i'm gonna make a movie.
and its gonna be REALLY good
then i'm gonna make a radio station
and it's gonna be better.
Then we went to school, well i went tot he doctor's and then school
and Cassie bought me breakie! (L) then i went to tim hortons with Katie and Kaela. it was fun
Then we watched this thingy and had a ""party"" out side
Then me and kahlei hungout until soccer.&nbsp; I SCORED. but we still lost. We weren't playing good at all!
Then we got to school and cassie was waiting for me and we were locked out of the school
eventually a nice janitor let us in and i got my stuff
me and cassie decided to go badck to my house to get coolers
on the bus i realized i still had soccer clothes on and changed on the bus. it was hard
Then we ate at smitty's and got coolers.&nbsp;
i was a really good actor and pretended to call a cab.&nbsp; ( my&nbsp; mom didn't want us to take a bus with alcohol all the way to the north end)
so me and Cassie left with the coolers in our bag, and ran until my mom wouldn't be able to see us
we caught a bus and then got onthe 8
the 8 was a fun bus ride
we were trying to look for cab numbers because we needed to take a cab to travis'&nbsp; We were both laughing really hard
we also tryed to find travis' number and finally got Dustin's number and i talked to him for the first time&nbsp; :)&nbsp; we got his address and every thing was good
Then some stupid guy sat beside me and obvioulsy doesn't know what personal space means
and these girls had a knife with them
Wehn we got downtown we found a cab number and called
We waited at kingsway and cassie froze to death. Then finally the cab showed up&nbsp;
and as soon as we got inthe cab our cell phones dissapears
i almost had a heart attack
but we found them and then went on our merry way to travis'
When we got there we had lots of fun, and made lots of new friends!
i didn't drink alot but still had tons of fun.&nbsp;
Then we ate mc donalds and went to bed
inthe morning we relaxed and took our time getting ready
Then being the geniouses that we are we pre bought pirates tickets and then went to Marble Slab on jasper ave
We talked to city hall to meet kahlei and then pretty much left
We got to cassies ate really yummy bread and then headed to the movie
IT WAS GOOD, but long
jesse drove us home and i was tired and went to bed
in the morning Kahlei was gone
and :( poor ugo
i felt so bad.&nbsp;
he was a good cat
i felt really bad for Barb, she was really upset

now i'm home and i read and now i'm hungry

then me and kahlei went back to my house for like 30mintues. becasue ihad to straighten my hair&nbsp; :)
then we hopped back on a bus and went back downtown and met my mom for dinner.
We were kinda late, so my mom was a tad mad at me, because i need to do my hair&nbsp; :P
but then we were waiting for the bus to go to school and i was standing inside the bus shelter and i was like man, it kinda smells like an outhouse in here. Then kahlei came in and was like thats gross
THEN, my mom pointed out that someone took a big dump in the bus shelter. it was extremly disturbing. Kahlei laughed REALLY REALLY REALLY hard.&nbsp;
so we got to school to see the play. and OMG WAS IT GOOD
soo much better than at school, like it was amazing, absoulty amazing. EVERYONE did fanstastic
Then after the play we talked to MJ's parents. which made me really happy
i gave them both hugs and exchanged ""i miss yous""
then kevin gave me like THE BEST compliment i think i've ever gotten
he was like i honestly think that you were the best thing thats ever happened to mj.. one day he will realize what hemissed out on.
:) i was like wow.. you don't even understand how much that means to me
then hes like i'll slap him around a little bit.&nbsp;
I reallllly miss them, like so much.

i hate feeling the way that i feel
like i could care less that we aren't dating, but serioulsy treat me with a little respect
i find it werid, we dated for what almost 7 months and you don't care enough to even talk to me
your a jerk
you really really are.
i should have seen it last year when you treated me as if i didn't exist for 2 months.&nbsp;
i am a human, i do have feelings
I also don't understand, because you hated what derek did, and you're doing exactly what he did
expect you don't have a reason at all...
i've never did anything bad to you.&nbsp;

FUCK.&nbsp;

"event","Okay
so yesterday was awesome
I actually went and applied at a store, i'm going to go do more probably tomorrow
Then i bussed all the way to my aunties on sask. drive.&nbsp;
Once I got there we all talked and stuff, THEN my grandpa drove me home in a Rolls Royce limo!
it was awesome
i felt oh so rich
my auntie put a scarf around her head and had the big sunglasses on, so she was pretending she was rich. And everytime someone looked at her she would pull the scarf across her face so they couldn't see her
it was EXTREMLY funny, you kinda had to be there though
So then i went home and watched a good night of tv. LOST WAS GOOD AS ALWAYS
Today i slept in then woke up and watched tv. Then i made myself pancakes&nbsp;
then i cleaned my room, walked to the store
then MJ came a picked me up and we went to TMNT
IT WAS SO GOOD&nbsp; (L)
i realllly like michealangelo (sp?) he was funny&nbsp; :)
so i had a really nice time, and now i'm waiting for the sun to set a little more so i can go running&nbsp; :)"

The weekend i took just to relax and get my head around things
then monday i met up with Matt and my Mom and we went out for dinner, then i met Dan from Ten Second Epic. He gave me a hug, it was cute&nbsp; :) Then me and my&nbsp; mom headed down to millwoods but stopped by at the hospital to see my aunt first. We ended up seeing Ryan too. He had an irish accent. it made me happy!
Then on Tuesday i woke up late, got ready and just relaxed. Me and MJ were supposed to hang out but that didn't end up happening. So i went to the mall with Laura and i got Kahlei her birthday present!&nbsp; :)
Now today im gonna go get ready, and go job hunting&nbsp;

"event","Well enough is enough 
i confronted you YET AGAIN 
and this time, i actually got through too you about how upset it was actually making me 
so instead of showing me that you actually cared for me at all and deciding that you'll talk to me at school ( which i know. IS SO HARD) you decide that you can't give me what i deserve 
let me restate. that i don't want to be treated like a princess, i would just like to be treated like a human and perhaps your girlfriend. 
and thank you so much 
for leaving me when you know im going through alot right now 
that also shows that you care for me alot 

:)

but the part that hurts the most is that i know you don't care"

"event","So last night I went to MJ's
me and MJ had a big talk in the car and we both felt better
When we got to MJ's everyone was all happy. We watched Kathy play with dolphins and got presents. ( I REALLY LIKE MY STUFF)
So we all chatted about there trip. Well they chatted, which those who didn't go listened to there stories.&nbsp;
By this time it was late. so we were all tired. Me and MJ got the beds set up and we laid down on the bed in the rec room.&nbsp;
we talked for a long time. it was really&nbsp; nice
THEN he went to his room to sleep and i fell asleep right away. ( mj left elmo right beside me so i could snuggle with, which i didnt)
Then at 700 Kevin woke me up and i laid in bed for a really long time, eventually i decided to get up and i put my hand down and i hear . ""OH OH OH BOY. THAT TICKLES""&nbsp;
serioulsy freaked the crap out of me
then mj asked his dad if we could sleep more and he said yes
so mj came and slept beside me
THEN WE WENT TO SCHOOL
school was good
i dont like math. ITS TOO HARD"

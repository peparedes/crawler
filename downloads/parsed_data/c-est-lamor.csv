"event","Today was mine & ian's 1 month. Yay! To bad he would have never known if i didn`t tell him. So, i skipped 2nd period with david. We hung out in the girls bathrooms & stood on the toilets & looked over at eachother & giggled. Oh, it was fun.
After school i went over to david's, of course. Then me, david, ian & mitchell went to david's church. I saw this guy with the most nastyest, funnyest, hugest belly button i have ever seen in my entire life. And mitchell kept making me laugh durning this movie, so pretty much, everyone at david's church hates me now. Damn.
Tomarrow's picture day, and i suck at updating this.
Goodbye."

"event","I woke up this morning 5:45 in the fucking morning because laura kept squirting blood from her vagina & she was really really sick.
I got to cram in a 7 seater car with 10 other people, not including me. It was hot, i was tired, and the people i was crammed in the car with, were fucking annoying as hell.
Laura's baby was ready to come out, it was breach, she's due in another month, and for some reason, she had blood comming out everywhere? She had a seasection, and now, the baby's temperature keeps going down. 
Yep.
I spent all day at the hospital, i spent like $20 dollars on food that was no more than $1. So much for my diet.
I was SUPPOSE to hang out with my davie boo boo tonight, but i'm tired as hell, and i have to babysit my sister. Hopefully tomarrow i can go out with him, his mommy, & his sister. Fun fun fun! :)"

"event","I swore up & down i wouldn't make another one of these damn things, but i was forced into doing it by stewy.
School was school.
No good point's to tell about durning my school day. After school i went over to david's to do ""homework"". Actually, i only went over there to hang out, but it ended up in me doing david's homework. His mom flipped out when she saw i was at her house when she wasn't there. Eh. Then, ian came over and still, i continued to do david's homework. 
I have cramps like a motherfucker. 
I'm insanley tired. I'm going to sleep before 8:30 the latest tonight.
That's all."

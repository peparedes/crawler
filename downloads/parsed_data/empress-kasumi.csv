Well I have entered a couple of retrospective entries below from the last couple of months from times when I have not had access to the net. If you manage to read through all that inane waffling, here is some current waffling for you :D

Yesterday and, thus far at least, today have been fab. B has gone to Somerset for a karate thing this weekend so I have basically been pottering about on my own. Yesterday morning I went to aikido like normal, did a teeny bit of shopping including buying myself a heart shaped valentines day cookie which was yum - holiday themed cakes and biscuits make me so happy!!! Then I did a grocery shop at morrisons, or at least, got as much stuff as I could carry. Got the bus home in the pretty sunshine and then was very good and did some study. In the evening I made myself dinner (veggie burgers and salad, yum) watched some Scrubs & some of Millenium Actress (anime movie) and had a divine bubble bath with some special radox stuff I got for muscle relaxation. I also got a stress relief one! Today so far I have woken up and posted on here, while listening to the divine Kerrang radio. I am planning on making chocolate crispy cakes today. I even bought mini marshmallows to go in them :D I also gotta do some of the washing and some more study, and I want to write up some notes on aikido moves and practise some shinkeendo. Wow. I guess that means I better get going.

Here's to not leaving my journal neglected for so long next time!!

Love to ya all

"event","OMG OMG need to updaaaaaateeee!!! This poor little journal is so neglected! I have a big list somewhere of stuff I have done, to post about, but it is downstairs and I am upstairs! So you get random gibberish instead! Life is OK at the moment, it has kinda gone back to normal after all the fun and excitement of summer. The usual ups and downs. But, that is kinda cool, sometimes it's nice just to know where you are, and what's going on.

Autumn is a very contemplative time for me, every year. It seems to me the biggest season of change, and every year I have to come to terms with it. I think I have made my peace with the end of summer for this year. This does not mean that within a few weeks I will not be sick of the dark evenings. I will. But, right now, I'm thinking of it as an oppurtunity for cosiness with big fluffy jumpers and endless cups of hot chocolate. And many movies.

I went out with 2 friends from work this evening for a chinese. I'm not a big Chinese fan, but the food was actually great. And it was nice to spend some time with the girls while not being at work :P I miss my friends back home. I need to go home soon. Next weekend I'm seeing the girls from work again for an evening of Disney movies :D then the next day I'm off to Birmingham with some other friends for a craft exhibition. I bought a craft knife on Sunday and when opening it sliced my thumb so deeply that it has still not healed. There was much blood. 

I have started writing poems again, sort of. It felt good to write something expressive. I used to write a lot, then just stopped one day, because I guess I had nothing to write about any more. I just don't think they generally make much sense. I enjoy creating worlds where everything is metaphorical, and I pick words for how they sound & the images they conjure up just as much as for what they mean. Rythym is important too. I started wanting to write again after reading some of my poetry books from the Romantic era - Byron, Shelley, Keats etc...and that reminded me just why I love them so much. I envy people who can weave such beauty... how can they, who lived so many years ago, affect my life and make me feel so powerfully with something they jotted down so long ago? It just seems so odd, how what we do in our lives affects things in ways we'll never even know.

Anyway, I guess that is enough for now, bye bye till next time :D

Yes it is I, your empress and leader, come to lead you to the promised salvation...also known as an updated blog :P
Long time no update, due to hectic life lol!! I guess that's why we all have these things, to try and keep track of each other, and ourselves, in the manic washing machine of life!! Well shedloads has happened since my last update in...november! Fairly unsuprisingly, I suppose. Some good some bad some rather cheesecake like... (gimme a break it's late and things start getting a little surreal in my head around this time). There's been no cheesecake really. I don't like cheesecake. What there has been is banana flavoured crisps...I kid you not. Straight from Japan and purchaised from the sublime Oriental City. They don't work if you try and eat them as crisps however. You have to eat them as if they were sweets. It gets very confusing. 

My main points of interest since november:

* discovered a pretty forest near where we live for walks and picnics when it's not too cold
* Christmas happened, I tried to stop it but it was having none of it. Apparantly the world can't be put on hold just for me. But Christmas was fab, spent with family and saw friends too. Proceedings were helped along smoothly by Nigel, our organic Christmas turkey, who was delicious. I got some kick-ass pressies, which reminded me how lucky I am to have so many cool ppl who know me so well, and are willing to buy me kick-ass pressies lol :)
* made some new friends :D - a couple met thru Byron's aikido, which I have now started too. But that's another bullet point. Said friends are v cool and we have lots in common. We have had a few friendy evenings involving sushi and smashed chopping boards and another one is coming up soon. Hopefully with less destruction.
* Started tomiki aikido, which I adore. The people are fab and they give me lots of compliments so that helps :) Apparantly I have a knack for it, I think it's cos I learn best when I have structure, and if there is a buzzword for tomiki it would be ""structure"". Or ""fishcake"".
* Lady K became a fully fledged adult type person of one and twenty years :) and I was there on her special day, yay!!
* Tried out a yoga class. Good experience but don't feel I have the energy and time to devote to it that I would need to make it a rewarding experience.
* Got a bonsai tree! Yay! He is so pretty! He was sad when we moved him from mum's house to mine as the type of tree it is doesn't like being moved about. But under my care and nurture he is regaining healthy green leaves :) it really is like having a pet, I check on him morning and evening and am worrying about him now I'm at mum's for a few days!!
* Got my hair done!! Fairly drastic change which I have been craving for a while. Cut to shoulders, thinned out and random streaks of dark russety red put in. It looked stunning when they'd just done it, dazzling colour and they straightened it to perfection. I was a bit gutted when the colour faded after one wash and it went back to the normal poodle curls tho :( but I'm OK now - I got some special shampoo for coloured hair and the red still looks lovely. I think wavy hair is with me for life, I just can't afford super straighteners at the mo. But as mum said, if that's the worst of my problems, I'm doing pretty well ;)

No doubt there is more but can't think of it rite now. Oh, George, my new friend, has got me into cardmaking as she is creative in a big way! It's been far too long since I picked up my cross stitch kit or scrapbooking keepsakes, and it's one of my list items I am mentally noting in a shameless plagery of lady K's life list to do more to nuture my creative side. Here are some other bits off the top of my head:

1) help out a good cause in some way, be it volunteering at an animal shelter or doing admin work for a charity. Won't be able to do this till after exams at the earliest
2) take good care of myself and keep chilled while studying towards said exams. They can make you crazy, folks.
3) Start writing again. This goes hand in hand with the creative one I suppose.
4) Practice zazen - this is Japanese buddhist meditation which I have found refreshingly calming. We do a few minutes in shinkendo every week and I have started to read up on it. It's blissfully simple - you just sit, that's all there is to it. You just sit there and do nothing, and just be aware of the world. There's no complicated thought thing you have to do, no ultimate goal, it's the perfect antidote for someone like me who's mind goes a mile a minute and can sometimes get wound up like one of those little toy soldiers till I fizzle out in a state of madness. So, just sitting is sometimes the best thing you can do.

So this week has been awesome. Wednesday we came down to mum's to head off to London. We wandered round Camden, the national gallery which was a fantastic experience (but kinda embarassing clomping around in stupidly sized boots on a wooden floor - eek!) then off to see staind in the evening. It was pretty cool, Byron's the fan really but I knew sufficiently enough to enjoy myself, sing along a bit, and anyway, you don't need to know lyrics to headbang lol!! Thursday we visited the scrumptious new Calamity Comics shop where we spent most of our life savings on comics and mags, but it was SO worth it. I found this great mag, ""Gothic Beauty"", imported from America, with goth lifestyle, fashion, music stuff etc and some very pretty pictures. After that it was off to Oriental city, purchase of some wicked Japanese stuff including said banana crisps and some truly oriental lunch (salmon sushi and miso soup for me). I think I appreciated the shops a lot more than last time I went, a good 3 or so years ago. Especially the homeware shops, being a homeowner now :)

So I guess I had better be off to bed now, no doubt there was shedloads more I wanted to say but it can wait for another day.

Take care my lovelies

"event","OMG, I cannot believe I forgot to blog about some exciting stuff!! Well, exciting to me anyway.

1) Wayne's tattoo - this is very cool. I couple of weeks ago at shinkendo I spotted a tattoo on Wayne Sensei's huge arm (not that I was staring or anything, honest!) Byron & I seem to be the only ones there who don't have tattoos. Anyway, It was 3 Japanese characters and I asked him afterwards what it meant (I'm always very curious to know what means so much to people that they would implant ink under their skin in eternal honour of it). And here is the reply; ""it refers to my passionate love of rock music"". OMG, how cool is that!! It's Japanese, and rock music!! Wow!! Apparantly Wayne has like 1200 CDs altogether, so there's something to aim for!

2) Cool purchases - last weekend I had a great shopping session in town after meeting Byron from aikido. We had a trawl round the calendar stall and Byron got me for Christmas a Princess Ai calendar which I'm supposed to forget lol, and I bought myself the most beautiful gothic calendar. I was so impressed by the selection there. I will have my Princess Ai one up at work and the goth one probably in our new bedroom. I can't believe we found an anime calendar!! I also bought a great gift for Lady K, which I can't go into for obvious reasons :) but I am very chuffed with it.

That's all for now, any more afterthoughts, I'll let you know lol :)

Take care

PS Wayne used the word ""kasumi"" last nite to explain the block! Hah! It was so weird!"

"event","Hi!

I know, I know, ages since last update. How bad am I. But - I have an excuse, I have been moving! Stuff is making its slow yet merry way from our house at one end of the road to our house at the other end of the road :P - it's all a bit surreal, carrying all our worldly possessions in various carrier bags & rucksacks 5 mins down the road! Our new lounge is more or less set up and stuff is being dumped in both bedrooms but not particularly sorted out yet, and our bed and some other big stuff is still at the old house, but we're hoping to move all that this weekend. So at the mo, when we wanna watch TV, we have to walk to the new house, watch whatever, then go back out in the freezing cold to walk back to the old house to go to bed! Which kinda sucks. But we won't have to do it for much longer. Our main things we still have left to buy are a wardrobe, curtains for the bedroom and a katana & painting for the lounge. Actually, I'm off now to look at blades UK, a sword website, and then do my audit homework. Uni is fine, I'm actually understanding everything OK, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will never quite be up to date with the reading of the textbooks, due to the fact they are huuuge!! 

Before I go I have a baffling anecdote for you. Byron has long been convinced that somewhere there is a person who steals all the divider things you use on the conveyor belts at the Tesco checkouts and puts them all in a room somewhere, just so they can sit and laugh at the anarchy that ensues (we can't be the only ones who've noticed the slow decline in divider numbers, surely?) and during last week's shop that same person seems to be employing strange tactics to mess with our minds. At the checkout next to ours, just a normal checkout mind, there were 3 upside down baskets placed in a line down the conveyor belt and a notice pinned to the front end saying ""only hand baskets will be accepted at this till"". I mean, what???!!!!! Does that make ANY sort of sense??? But anyway. Spooky.

Take care people!!

This is just a quickie to say hello and all is OK! House completion has gone through, we now have the keys and are in the early stages of decorating, hurrah! So you probably won't hear from me in a while, at least not by internet. I had an update planned but seem to have lost it, it wasn't very long anyway. Quick rundown of my life lately; felt ill all last week then woke up saturday with a chest infection :( off work mon and tue, still taking antibiotics but its getting better. Ann Summers party last wed was a blast, Shinkendo was good, really think it's coming on but I'm not there tonite cos a) I don't wanna strain the old trachea and b) don't wanna make my bug worse by going on a cold, wet motorbike ride. Must remember to blog about Wayne's tattoo at some point :) House purchase completed on monday, all is roaring ahead at a great rate of knots, base coat has gone on lounge walls, coving up, sofas have been delivered, carpets coming next tuesday and some serious decorating/moving stuff going on this weekend.
Soooo I think that is all my brain can come up with at the moment, don't know if I'll have time for Christmas this year lol!!! Take care all,
xx Empress K xx"

"event","Hi everyone!! First, an apology; I apologise. Specifically, for not updating in forever and generally seeming like I'm ignoring everyone, which isn't the case, life has just got hectic again!! Before I go any further, I think you should find out a little more about the livejournal mascot:
http://www.livejournal.com/site/goat.bml
Right, now that's out the way, on with the update. Did you like my subject lol!!! The hospital went great, or I guess as well as a hospital appointment can go. I feel like I'm making progress now, the doc was really nice and understanding. I really felt she knew what she was talking about, which is a first as far as doctors are concerned. I am a ""complicated case"" and have been ""undertreated""!! Anyway, she had a few ideas and I'm seeing her again next feb, with my regular monthly appointments at my local hospital in the meantime.
So on to the most exciting part; THE CONCERT!!! Well wow, what can I say. Last Thursday I saw David Draiman & Co, and they set my world alight. I wore knee length skirt, vest top, New Rocks and pvc trenchcoat which just about solved the hot/cold problem. It was fun getting ready at work then having everyone stare at me while walking to the train, it's been sooo long since I got to properly dress up, lol!! Apart from an amusing train incident (Byron was supposed to meet me at MK station, it was all organised with military precision, but ended up on the wrong train and we had to meet at Euston instead) the journey there went fine. The Northern Line was closed but it was easy enough and didn't take very long to take an alternative route. I knew we were in the right place when we emerged from the subway to hear the ticket touts: ""buy or sell tickets for Disturbed?"" then followed various people in band T shirts to the venue. I niavely thought we'd just sort of stand around outside the doors, but then I saw the queue. The measly excuse for a queue at the post office will now never scare me again. It already covered two sides of the building and after we joined it quickly extended to go round a couple more corners. Had to wait for a while but it was good fun, listening to everyone chatting, looking at what everyone was wearing (I felt so at home, it was one of the few times I actually felt I fitted in somewhere) there were some great hairdos and outfits. At one point a guy came round with a video camera. I really really hope they don't use that shot of me for a DVD or anything, the best I could do was a meek attempt at the horns sign and a bemused smile, it caught me completely off guard! Before we got into the place we had to be frisked and the lady made me take my spiky necklace off :( it's not even sharp, I couldn't hurt myself on it if I tried!! Anyway, we went in and found we were on the balcony, which I didn't even know existed, but had a great view. We found ourselves a table where we dumped our stuff and sat down for the warm up band, who were OK but not that great but stood up for the whole of Disturbed's set. I can honestly say I have never experienced anything quite like that night in my whole life. The Astoria was a small venue, only a couple of thousand people were there, but 2 thousand people with their hands in the air screaming their hearts out to every word of every song is an awesome sight and sound. Disturbed's singer David Draiman has such a powerful prescence, apart from being gorgeous he has the most wonderful voice which I have best heard described as being ""somewhere between gravel & velvet"". From the minute he and his band stepped onto that stage he had complete mastery over everyone. Such power, such energy emanated from the band that you could actually physically feel it, coupled with the euphoria from the crowd made for a truly awesome experience, one that reminded you what it actually means to be alive. There is nothing quite like getting swept up and losing yourself like that. They played some wicked songs and everyone seemed to know them all by heart, luckily they included some of my favourites :) They must have been playing for about an hour and a half altogether, how they kept up that pace and that energy I will never know. They tried to end with ""The Sickness"" but we chanted ""we want more!"" and they gave in and performed two more songs. The last song, stupify, leant itself to one of the best moments of the night; if you know the song, you'll understand why it's a concert song, it's very erm, interactive, and we all joined in as instructed, lol!! The other best moments of the night were forgetting my own existence to the music during the fantastic guitar solo in ""Stricken"" and every single person chanting to the derranged nightmare lyrics in the middle of ""The Sickness"" (where Mr Draiman sat on top of the crowd - what I wouldn't have given to be down there at that point!!). All in all it was a wonderful experience. I felt drunk afterwards (obviously I wasn't actually drunk as I don't drink) and the cold air felt so refreshing after being cooped up and sweating like crazy from all the dancing. We got some snacks and made our giddy way home. The next day I was in a world of pain; pain in my feet from my ridiculous but oh so lovely shoes, pain in my arms from throwing the horns, pain in my back and neck from headbanging the night away, pain in my throat from screaming my heart out. But, I hadn't felt so good in a long time!!! The various pains have faded now but the memory will be with me forever :) I hope to see those guys perform live again someday, and hopefully by then I'll be a fanclub member which will mean I'll actually be able to meet them - just gotta practice keeping the function of speech for that occassion, lol!!
So that was my recent exciting activity. Now I am desperately trying to catch up with uni work, get the ironing done, keep the house tidy, etc etc, all those crappy jobs! The house still seems to be going through OK, we've ordered ourselves a sofa for it so that's exciting. Yesterday we went to see Corpse Bride at the cinema, I loved it, it was really good! What's more there was a bit of a problem with the screen so we got free tickets for next time - result!! I'm still going to Shinkendo and have joined now, so I'll have to get myself a gi, but I HAVE NO MONEY!! CHRISTMAS HAS BANKRUPTED ME!!! Shinkendo is lots of fun :) I'm going out with the girls from work this Friday then next Wednesday evening I've got Stacey's Ann Summers party, so my hectic life continues! Don't worry if you don't hear from me, I'm fine :)
All the best
xx Kasumi xx

PS Disturbed have cancelled the rest of their tour after our concert - poor Mr Draiman has an infection on the vocal chords :( he is going to be OK but I can't help but feel partly responsible!"

"event","Hi everyone, hope you are all doing well. I must admit I haven't really been in the sphere of communication this week, you forget how hectic life gets when uni beckons!! Last weekend was great, the ballet was fantastic and I even treated myself to a cool neon pink ""Dracula"" shirt. As an unexpected bonus collectormania was on so we had a bit of a trawl round there too. Tuesday was my first day back at uni. The first two lessons were fine, the last was hard work but I knew it was going to be, it's my least favourite subject but I think I should be fine as long as I give a bit of extra time to my home studies on that one. Thursday I got to shinkendo again, I'm really enjoying it. I even think I'm starting to remember a few things!! The five stance sequence is called goho no kamae. I won't be going next week as it's the concert on thursday :D When we told our sensei he suprised us because we found out he's also a Disturbed fan!!! (It's Disturbed I'm going to see Itara, a lot of people haven't heard of them). Not only that but he used to be a guitarist in a rock bank and has played gigs all around the UK! Wow! I was so impressed! So we stood there talking about rock and metal music after class, it was cool. This morning I had a very successful shopping experience, and we also went to have a second look at our soon to be ours house, which are the two reasons today has been an exciting day. This morning I bought some work trousers, a waterproof handbag to take to work during the winter (my current South African bought one is gorgeous but made of stuff the rain goes straight through!!), treated myself to a gorgeous witchy-style black skirt, an eyeliner sharpener, some gel cushions for my New Rocks, an amusing badge from the market which says ""you can never wear too much black"" and a cool hairtie with three black roses on it. The badge and black roses are the finishing touches for another bag which I am gothing up for use at the concert among other times. I got it from Primark ages ago, it's black with three pockets and a silver chain running across it. I've already sewn a nightwish patch on and put a ""goth"" badge on it. I am gonna go watch some rented movies now and gorge myself on crisps and dip :) Tomorrow mum and dad are coming to fetch me cos they are taking me to a hospital appointment on monday, so please keep your fingers crossed for that for me. Love to you all

"event","Well, what an exciting time!! I made it to Shinkendo last night and really enjoyed it. It was only my first lesson so obviously I didn't really know what I was doing but I learnt a lot and it was good fun. I got to use a bokken - wooden sword, learnt some relevant Japanese words, how to kneel, where to place your sword when kneeling, correct footwork, a five stance sequence whose name eludes me using the bokken, sheathing, unsheathing & chiburi (blood flick). That just means I know them, it doesn't mean I'm very good at them!! I will definately go again next week. The only thing I'm worried about is that all the other guys there have martial arts expereince and I have none, I'm not even very good at normal sports, but we'll see how it goes. Learning is a slow process. I was just searching on the internet and found out ""kasumi"" is a move in shinkendo - how weird is that?! ""mist, or haze. A high position block."" I haven't learnt it yet but think I might be doing so next week. I guess that is why they renamed Kasumi to Misty - can't believe I never knew that.
My concert tickets were delivered to me at work today so I'm on a high now :D I think everyone in the office knows about it by now!!! I really, really can't wait to go but I bet it will feel like it's over so quickly.
Tomorrow we're on the bike again, this time to get to Dracula at the ballet. Should be yet another new experience for me (had a lot of those this year). I'm looking forward to that to. Kasumi is a busy girl!!
I'm hoping to get to chat to Lady K tonite if everything goes to plan, I'm looking forward to that as well! So, in general, life is exciting!!!
Till next time

"event","Hello!
Before I start, I have had a brainwave. Instead of typing actual music that is currently playing from now on I am going to type the music that I am playing in my HEAD cos there is always something there, otherwise I will always be typing ""office noises"". So hah. Thought I would explain my name as well, just for a laugh. I still haven't found an avatar. I was going to upload one of elmer the elephant but it was too big and I can't be bothered to mess around with it. Will find one soon. Anyway, name. Well, clearly I'm an empress, but the kasumi bit as a Japanese name, and I am a bit of an otaku (obsesee). Kasumi is the name Misty from Pokemon had in the Japanese version, and I used to be a massive Pokemon & Misty fan. Plus, Kasumi is just a really pretty name. I was going to go with something to do with Delirium (Sandman reference) but the cool ones were taken. So goes life. So my name represents the anime part of my nature rather than the colourful, cheerful part of my nature. 

Anyway, decadence!! I went to the ball on Saturday and wow....I mean WOW :0 - ever had a string quartet play for you while you eat? I have!!!! We both looked amazing if I do say so myself and the do was at a really posh private school, amazing grounds, and everyone looked just great. Luckily the people themselves weren't too posh, they were only Byron's work buddies, so I was able to chat to everyone fine. And I wasn't too bunged up either! We had to leave a bit early to bike it home (not in my ball gown I hastened to add) and a great evening was had by all.

We were also decadent on Sunday because we did virtually nothing. It was great - we got Tesco done on Saturday so had no obligations at all. 

Also on the theme of decadence I have been listening to ""decadence"" from Disturbed's new album. The album is growing on me slowly but surely. I am trying to learn the lyrics from all 3 albums before I go see them on 13th October. I am soooo excited!! Next Saturday we're going to see Dracula at the ballet so that should be good too. On a less exciting note, I start uni next tuesday. Boo.

Here's hoping I make it to Shinkendo (samurai sword class) this thursday.

I don't have a lot to update about really but am bored at lunchtime. I'm feeling really icky. I have a nasty cold. As a result I haven't been doing much lately, except having early nights and drinking lots of hot lemony drinks...mmm, comforting :) I am hoping it clears up for the ball on saturday :( As usual I have been looking up random junk on the internet including cosplaying, which was induced my reading neo last night (anime mag). A new obsession which I don't have time for possibly beckons. I was hoping to go to Byron's samurai sword class tonight but I just don't feel up to it. Hopefully I will make it next thursday.

Hm well I think that's the extent of my life at the minute, I will shortly resume preparing accounts and will then go home and sleep lots.

"event","Hi! Wow, it's amazing how your life changes when you get an online journal (one you intend to update anyway) everything I've been doing, I thought, hmmm, what shall I write about this on my journal lol!! It goes to show that even the small things you do in life are important, they all contribute to the experience you have had of the world that ultimately makes you you. That's the reason I love to scrapbook, to capture all those tiny moments, what happened and how I felt, that might otherwise have been lost in the mists of time or memory. Anyway, I know this page looks a bit sucky right now but I haven't had time to fiddle around with the colouring properly yet. 

I have been doing a lot of stuff lately and have a lot of stuff coming up, which is good cos I think it's always important to have something to look forward to. On Thursday evening Byron went to a samurai sword class which I had spotted an ad for in our local mag. It sounded pretty fun, I might go along and try it next week. On Friday evening I went to Tim at works 30th birthday bash. I didn't know what to expect, sometimes you've nothing to talk about when you only know people from work. As it turned out it was a great evening. Byron came along and only a few people from work, and everyone I'm pretty friendly with anyway so we had plenty to talk about. As the title would suggest I had a go on the karaoke which was the main star of the evening. Not on my own I hasten to add, with Suzanne, Danielle and Stacey from work. We sang ""it's raining men"" - such a laugh and we didn't sound too bad in my opinion!!! 

Yesterday (Sat) went to town for a bit in the morning then rode on the bike to a car park (bear with me on this one) where we met Byron's family who were racing their mini motos around the car park. After that we took an unexpected ride to Milton Keynes and back to ""give me some experience on the bike"". It was OK, with every ride I take it gets more cool and less scary. I'm still not a big fan of roundabouts though. However, I'm learning to lean into corners rather than just shutting my eyes and praying!! The main problem we have is with communication. Talking gets very interesting with helmets on and visors down. Example: I asked Byron ""are we going to MK?"" his reply: ""yeah I'm OK, are you OK?"" lol!!!

This morning I walked to Church and on the way back dropped in on one of my bus friends. She said to pop round as she might have some jewellery that would be good for the ball I'm going to next Saturday (eek! Scary and yet exciting at the same time!). It was cool to see her and nice to know she existed other than in the confines of the bus. I have so many bus friends now (""bus buddies"" is the term Jodi uses when she introduces me to anyone!) there are 3 gals I chat to if they're standing at my stop in the morning and several others who get on at different stops. You never know who to expect tho as everyone has different work/college days. It's nice to talk to friendly people first thing in the morning, it helps you wake up a bit and face the day a bit better. Other than that, today we just walked to the big tesco for our grocery shop, which is no mean feat if you think about it and slobbed out in the living room in front of video games. ""Fear the tube!!!"" that will take some explaining. It's to do with the video game (legacy of kain: defiance). Unfortunately I now have to do some housework. I don't know how I'm going to fit all this around studying when I go back next month. I made a timetable but it's anyone's guess if I stick to it!

Please keep your fingers crossed for us on the house people, mortgage people and solicitors are doing stuff for us at the moment and it is a very nerve racking time as far as that's concerned. Anyway, I don't know really who will be reading this except my friends but if you did a random search or something, hi!! Nice to meet you :)

Back to work tomorrow boo!! Till next time,

"event","Hi! Wow, first entry, yay! Well right now I am at work on my lunchbreak so today I have mostly been doing the accountant thing. I took a short walk to get some keys cut which was nice, it is sunny outside but breezy too so not sweaty-hot. I have been looking at various websites online and came across this site:
http://www.talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html which I think a certain few of my friends will be very interested in, lol!! Well, today has been not too bad, found out Byron got offered the part time lecturing job at college so the extra money will come in very handy. I also finally got a goth top I ordered online about July time, it is gorgeous so I'm chuffed to bits!! Am trying to decide whether to wear it to the disturbed concert I'm going to in October, if anyone out there has any suggestions about this dilema I'd be very grateful. You see, I want to look gothic and gorgeous for it but at the same time I don't want to freeze to death in October weather while getting to London AND don't want to boil when actually IN the concert. So - dilema!!! What else is going on....we're seeing the mortgage man again tonight. Our offer has actually been accepted but the mortgage people have to do some stuff and then solicitors have to do some stuff etc...so the actual moving won't be happening for a while yet. Memo to self: must find cool avatar!!
Gotta go, it's nearing the end of lunch.

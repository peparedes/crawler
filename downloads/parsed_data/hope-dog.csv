yesterday at work everyone complimented me on my nice hair i didn't know what to say because i was just born with it all i do is have it trimmed and washed once in a while!

i am staying with uncle scott and aunt jeneen for a few days! moms leg is sore and she needs to stay off her paws for a while. i tried to tell her that licking sore things feels quite good but she told me maybe she wouldnt"

"event","thats what mom says about me but im always under the weather except when im inside so why she says that i dont know. i have been quite tired lately my job is very good but those little dogs sure are active and they bark a lot! way more than me. my co workers all say that i am the best behaved dog there but i know the others are all rowdy so maybe thats not very hard.

i figured out that mom could put yoh gurt on my food any time not just as a treat or at break fast so ive been not eating until she does that and it works! my management experience is good for how to handle people i guess."

i had a very interesting day at my job yesterday there were a lot of visitors so everything was crazy! i had to go in the regular dog pen to settle everyone down they were very releeved to see me i think because they know i am very helpful and have quite a lot of responsibility.

tomorrow i am at work but i may sneak out and get my fur trimmed. i want to look like a career dog since thats what mom says i am so all this long hair in my eyes has to go!"

"event","auntie tiffany and her mom made me take a bath and then they plucked me bald with a sharp metal thing. it was very uncomfortable. now i smell all right kind of sweet but i lost the smells id been collecting so i have to go back and get them all again and hopefully some new ones.  i rolled in the grass last night so i got started anyway. 

i said hopefully and my name is hope! i made a joke!

"event","ive been so busy busy busy! theres been a ton of stuff going on. i went to doggy daycare three times last week and i ran around a lot keeping all the little dogs in line. auntie tiffany and molly always give me yummy treats before i come home. and mom and dad had people come over twice so i had to say hi to everybody which is fun but also quite tiring.

the cats have been especially tiring lately. they had to go to the veturn vetorina doctors for shots one day so i had to make sure that they were still okay even though they smelled sort of weird after that and the three-legged kitty was sleeping all the time.

there was a <small>thunderstorm</small> tonight but i remembered what my friend keikamalu said that maybe the sky wasnt mad at me but maybe some other dog like maxine next door and then it wasnt so bad and then it went away right away! so i guess i showed that sky that hope-dogs are pretty brave! but i still dont like <small>thunderstorms</small>.

"event","she does that sometimes and i dont ever understand it. why does she have to go anywhere? theres so much to do right here! anyway even though there were <small>thunderstorms</small> it was okay because dad was still here and hes better with <small>thunderstorms</small> than mom is because hes bigger than she is so if the sky gets mad at him he can yell back at it. but now shes here too so i got to lie right next to her when the <small>thunderstorm</small> started this morning and dad was there too so everything was fine.

she put yummy cottage cheese on my food last night. it was very delicious."

"event","wow is it hot! everybody tells me that its always hot in august but i dont remember back to the last august. so its nice to stay inside where its cool and lie on my rug by the front door. last night i didnt want to go for my bedtime walk but that was just because i was tired from the little dogs at doggie daycare because it wasnt hot yet.

Im tired of the pills i have to take for my gee ardia. i haven't had any gee ardia for a long time now and i still have to take them. yuck!"

"event","mom was gone all day which i hated and then she came back and that was great and then she left again which i didnt like. but dad spent the whole day in the garage yesterday and he let me stay outside with him almost all day! i played hope-in-the-jungle and smelled squirrels and a bunch of bunnies but i couldnt find them anywhere. i smelled the neighbor dog maxine too but she only likes to bark at me and we never get to play.

and then i was pretty tired so i had a nap in the grass which was nice and cool. i was so tired last night i slept really well and i had some dreams but i don't remember what they were."

"event","i went to doggy daycare and they put me with the little dogs because im so good with them like a mom auntie tiffany says. shes the nice lady who takes care of us and theres molly and lots of nice ladies! but the little dogs are really tiring. 

and there was a mean dog whos called snow who snapped at my mom! i was so mad but she didnt hurt her or anything and snows mostly blind and all deaf so i guess she just got scared or something. still i dont like snow very much for trying to bite my mom.

and then we came home and i had some yummy soft food and regular crunchy food mixed in and then i ate the yummy cat kibble (sorry kitties) and then i took a nap and then the spotty cat tried to eat some food off moms plate and when mom took it away from the spotty cat cause youre not supposed to steal food off moms plate or dads either she let me have a taste! then it was time for bed already. wow the days go by fast!"

"event","ive had the special food twice a day all weekend so its been pretty great. dad worked out in the garage and he needed me with him in case wolves came! they didnt so i didn't have to even do too much mostly.

there was a <small>thunderstorm</small> this morning. i didnt like that very much. <small>thunderstorms</small> are pretty scary because theyre really loud and the sky growls at you. how bad do you have to be or the sky to growl at you? pretty bad i think. theres supposed to be a <small>thunderstorm</small> tonight but i havent done anything wrong all day so i cant figure out why it would come here."

"event","ooooh exciting news! i have something the vet calls gee ardia or something! shes a new vet so i was a little shy at first but then they gave me treats and said i was a good girl! i guess that was because i didnt fight or bite her for giving me a big needle.

i felt really bad when mom came home and id made a mess on the living room floor. then dad came home and they both saw it. i cant clean up after myself you know. i couldnt help it and the living room is the best place because mom and dad will see it and the tiles are easy to clean. it didn't really hurt but the little bit of blood made mom and dad worry about me. they shouldnt worry because im fine! i just couldnt really hold it. i still feel like i need to go again.

so now i have special medicine. and don't forget! gee ardia means you get yummy soft food!

yay!

"event","dad put eggs in my food which was just yummy and i ate them all though he didnt give me more but theres a whole container in the reef refridgor ruf cold box thing so i bet i get some more today! mom slept downstairs because she was kind of sleepy and dad might keep her awake she thought so there was more room on the bed because there was only one person so i got to stretch out a little bit and no one kicked me or anything which was nice.

this morning i had to pee and other stuff but no one was awake so i jingled my collar at mom and eventually she let me out. boy was that close!

bye

"event","today im playing at doggie daycare with lots of little dogs. they think im their mom, which is kind of funny because i never had any puppies and i kind of like it that they think of me like that. i love my mom because she brings me to daycare three times a week and then takes me home so i can sleep. little dogs are very tiring. im not such a young dog anymore but i can still run and play all day! i met a new friend a few weeks ago and got to see him again last weekend. he is a little sheperkie or something like that. he likes to kiss me, but i get tired of that after a while. he also tries to do naughty things to me, but im much bigger than he is and can push him down and put his whole head in my mouth. then he listens to me!

well, i better get back to taking care of the little dogs. they are bouncing off of me like fuzzy fleas. i dont get fleas, which makes my parents very happy.

bye

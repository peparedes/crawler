Currently working in Starhub (lobo, bureaucratic job) and studying in a private university for my degree!! Finally!! Have been thinking of going back school but well, lazy, no money plays some parts here and then. 

Of course i have still been lamenting bout e standard of service in Singapore. Recently just terminated the my ADSL line wif PacNet. Cannot stand their non customer oriented service!! Hehe. I guess i never changed much except for my age and my stomach!! Fucking getting fat leh!! All e fats are ozzing out of my ribcage!! Lazy to jog... Sianz.. and what am i doing now?!?!? Damn... and i eat and eat and eat... Sighz...

"event","fter work went down to borders to buy a book for my dentist friend (got discount coupon today!). Sad tat i dun have more coupons, saw quite a number of books i wana buy!! esp one on the questions and answers bout rodents!! It will come useful when i tok to my customers! :P

Before i could choose my dog, realised tat my ex poly friends had a gathering in Scotts so off i go to meet em!! 3 of em never saw me without my specs and are quite surprise but as usual, the reactions are mixed. Say i look younger and more boy wif my glasses. Aiyah, watever lah~ I need to look more mature also~ :P

Had a long tok wit em, regarding work, regarding my recent argument wif M1, regarding our classmates. Phew... Quite fun i will say. I will reli miss poly life with all e fun in it.. Well, every phases of our life is a memorable one. No matter how bad or good it is. :)

Finally buy my book and went out wif my friend for dinner at Prata Place!! Well, gorge myself like hell. Had a teh tarik, half a mutton murtabak (its huge!!), one prata kosong and a mee goreng wif egg and mutton. Damn fun. As my digestive system is good, everything came out when i went home (shit lah) Quite wasteful.. Haha. Just got home so reply all my mails.. Still got a last one to finish. 

Good night!"

Well, he becomes an insurance agent but we din reli tok bout insurance. More on other ppl in our life (not gossip k!!) we are toking bout a guy whom both of us know in NS. He was saying tat he recentl met tat guy and realised that not only is he smoking, but he toks differently than before. He dun sound so friendly.. Well, maybe he is tired.. But i know better, tat friend of mine has always been a guy full of ambitions and he will like feel embarassed if u, as his friend, embarasses urself. Like once, when i was saying tat i can feel palpations (supposed to be palpitations) and he says tat im embarasssing myself.. Sighz.. Well... To me, if my friend do tat, i will just laugh and forget bout it. But he din.. im sad at tat moment but well... *shrugs*

Anyway got home and bath my dog!! And realised tat my younger sis is reli petty. Just ask her to move something out of my towel and she refused. Later she dun wnaa tok anymore. Then i say fine, dun tok lor. And she says : ""ok lor, i very ji chou (remember to revenge) one"" Then i say fine. Sometimes, i just cannot stand her. Wana act tough. Let her be then

Basically not a very good day for me...

"event","Actually suppose to have a very nice day today after working today but well... 

Have been spots appearing all ard my body a few days ago but thou its itchy, its not posing any problems to me mentally and physically. No fever, no muscle aches, no tiredness (no increased tiredness since im always tired). But TODAY! I got a fellow tenant in hougang who says i maybe getting chicken pox and asks me to go home. But from wat i know, chicken pox normally comes wif fever and i will feel very unwell and the spots will actually have water in it. I HAVE NONE!!

So after getting taunts from her (calling me chicken pox), i decide to go home earlier (sacrificing my 2 and a half hour pay) and see a doctor. But the clinic is closed!! So i have to wait until 6.30! I waited until i fell asleep! I maange to catch e doc and he says wat i have been suspecting! Its tick bites from my dog's ticks!! Gosh!! I have been using e SpoT on to eliminate the ticks and it not only kills, it repels! Tats why the ticks are all over my room! Damn! Have to do ALOT of area cleaning! But no new spots for e past few days so i guess the ticks shd be more or less gone.
:P

Suppose to go out wif a friend today to celebrate his birthday but well... Anyway, quite disappointed and sad in the end."

"event","Read e newspaper yesterday and realised that pedigree dry stocks tat are manufactured in Thailand, are suspected of contributing to kidney problems in dogs and e news article states that stocks in Taiwan, THailand and Philippines are suspending their sales.

Which brings a very crucial question, wat bout the stocks in Singapore? Pedigree Dry Food are also manufactured in Thailand and why are not e sales of the products being suspended? Apparently, i heard that its said tat AVA hasn't suspended the sale and its no proven that the dry food costs e kidney problems. So why suspend? 

Apparently, to consumers, its an ethical issue. Are we supposed to wait until e tests are proven, a few dogs have died, before we suspended e sales? Nevertheless, a lot of customers have oredi decided to switch to another brand, thou e salesppl dun placed a part at all. All we can say, as told by our company, is that :""It not proven and AVA hasn't suspended e sales, so it shd be safe""

Ard 7pm, a phonecall was made to e outlet and all dry pedigree food, including their Tasty Bone treats series and Ringo series are being suspended with immediate effect! Finally!!"

They say i can by e 5th of March but when i went down today, they told i cannot, i can upgrade my line but to get e phone at a promotional rate, i still need to wait for another 2 more months for my contract to end! Tats so stupid! its implied that when we ask for a upgrade, we wana upgrade our phone using e promotional rate!! And i called twice before i went down!! M1 suck big time in their customer service and by end of tis yr, i will cease to be their customer!

Actually have quite a good day until e M1 incident, fucking waste of time and i have to ask my sister (as its under her name) to make a trip down just for me. I worked until 3 plus today and straight away went down to city hall to buy my Sun Chlorella!! Finally got it!! :P After that pass by the Prince KTV and realises tat they just open a new japanaese restaurant and its quite cheap!! :P

After that went to Bugis check out e handphones there and speak to Joy and Lester who are working tehre~ :P Then bought a strawberry smoothie from Rockery and its nice!!

Abit tired but i have seen e preparation of tis shop when i pass by e area opp khatib camp (at McDonald's block) and am reli eagered to see wat they will offer as desserts. So today, i dropped a stop earlier and are reli surprised tat e shop is still opened!!

I order a fresh milk wif steamed egg white (cold) for $3 while waiting for my sister (who injured her elbow while jogging yesterday and am crying when she came home after falling down. Lol). The dessert is not bad wif e honey but the mixture is not reli smooth (its abit like soya beancurd). Besides, it makes u abit sick after u eaten a few mouthful.. 
Rating : 3.5 / 5

I order another in house speciality, its calamaries (8/pc for $4). I expected reli a small amount but when it came, im quite glad it comes wif more than 8 pieces of calamaries but also wif a 'few' fries. The texture of e calamaries is reli soft but yet wif a crunchy outer layer. Three words : I love it!!
Rating : 4.5 / 5

My sister came and we ordered an ice kacang (normal one) for $2. It looks nice but abit small for its price. But well, its air conditioned so i dun expect too much. The kacang got thsoe spongy little transparent balls (known as QQ balls i think) on it (tat explain e price maybe) and inside contains red beans, jelly and attap chee. But they actually includes a jelly thingy tat shaped like tadpole tat tastes not bad and not too sweet. But one bad thing bout e kancang, too much grass jelly and its abit hard!!! And e red beans are reli hard!!
Rating : 3 / 5

Tats all for e gourmet idiot!! :P

P.S. And one horrible thing tat faced me when i came home. Tats one big tick crawling on e ground and when i squeezed it, e blood reli splattered on e tissue!!"

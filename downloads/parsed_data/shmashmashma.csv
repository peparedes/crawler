"event","So wednesday was amazing. The AmeriKan Made show at the House of Blues was fun, and theeennnn Hannah and I decided to go to Errica and Paul's house in Orange and we somehow managed to get inside one of those giant inflatable snow globes with the snowmen inside of them and have a wrestling match in our underwear. It was so much fucking fun at the time, but then the next morning we looked through the pictures and well, we look fucking retarded to say the least.

But while we were still at the House of Blues they gave us 4 free tickets to go see and evening with John Kricfalusi (the creator of Ren and Stimpy). It was so cool! They played never before seen episodes of Ren and Stimpy and shit, oh man it was fun, until the question and answer part, people ask the stupidest questions.

...and I have a valentine tehehe.
But too bad I'm grounded because of the little snowman escapade instead of going home and going to school the next day."

I forgot to call Laura :( I have to stop smoking pot. Got drunk, Andy broke something, and I sprayed Alex and myself with a fire extinguisher on accident because I wanted to write my name on the wall with it. That was totally lame, I still don't think I got all the shit out of my throat.
and then.. there was saturday, the most amazing night ever! I saw Odd Project with Brent, saw Jenny, Terri and Larry, I haven't seen them in forever... 
uhhh I saw Eddie and Jon, he was so suprised to see me haha his face when he saw me was classic. There was this cool band wth a banjo and like a stand up bass, but it was like a chello too, I forgot what they were called.

MATT LAMB IS HOTTER THAN EVER!

I can still remember the first time I saw him and had to run back home to tell everyone I just saw the hottest guy ever at the Westminster mall, and of course everyone already knew who he was.
but yea, THEN we went to Sonics, it was amazing. I wish there was one closer than Anaheim.
aaaaand then me and Andy, Jaclyn, Nick and Sarah went to Jon's birthday thing in Wesminster at some chicks house, but it was boring.
I don't like Sarah. she sucks. but I'm probably just jealous.

what the hell is wrong with me?! haha. Maybe I'll find something similar. maybe.

EDIT:
Okay, maybe it wasn't as good as I want it to have been (that doesn't make sense). I think I'm wishing it was as good as it seems it was, because it just didn't work. FUCK me dude, I'm going to go listen to some music or something, I've lost it."

Andy won a massage thing so me and him have an appointment at 8 tomorrow to go get them, it's going to fucking rule. MASSAGES=HAPPINESS.

I have to go to Disneyland.
I've been craving the Haunted Mansion for like 2 weeks now and on sunday I woke up and stupid Mike was playing the song and I almost went crazy. Who want's to go durring the week sometime because the weekends are evil??

I feel like crap. I fucking can't stand Alexa, I've never really liked her at all, but now she's worse, and she won't shut the fuck up. plus she's ugly, and I don't feel bad saying any of that because anyone who knows her knows it's true.

MY LOVE OF MY LIFE IS SICK! I love my dog probably more than I love anyone or anything else, except for my grandma, who I don't have anymore, and my sister. I would die for him. that's kind of pathetic, but I love him. His back is really fucked up and he can't walk without falling over after a few steps.
They're putting him on the same medication they gave my grandma just before she went into the hospital for almost a year because it has probably the most horrific side effects. BOO PREDNISONE! It's ironic though, he's like the only attatchment I have left to my grandma and he's about to follow in her footsteps, well hopefully not, hopefully this makes him feel better.

fuck, I need a cigarette before I go back to my 2nd straight day of nothing but homework."

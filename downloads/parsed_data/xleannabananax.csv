Having it at Hard Rock Live is just awesome. even though during the night it felt like it was <b>300 degrees,</b> it was worth it. i saw courtney and talissa when we got there and they both looked gorgeous. the music was pretty good. could've been better but i was still jammin' :D once it got midnight, it was sad cuz i knew i had to wait another whole year :\ i got my pics developed today. their SOO good. not of me cuz i seriously look scared. my eyes are so wide and my smile is huge. i look like im gunna kill someone lol. i loved my hair though. :D When we got back home we ate of course and were exhausted. we fell asleep around 3 but once we woke up, we were all SOO sore from dancing hah. my thighs, ankles, feet everything hurt me.. BUT the pain is defiently worth it. :D

Cristina and Sarah spent the night afterwards and left this afternoon. since then i've just been doing errands with my dad, playing b-ball and listening to my <b> new </b> <i>""The Used""</i> cd. its awesome... im gunna try and burn it for you cristina...

"event","yep, no school tomorrow. sux in a way cuz our homecoming week is screwed up but i hate school so its okay. my dad has rooms at gaylord palms for his company and they said we could use one but were not going to... i dunno why though

well this past weekend has been soooooooo boring. omggg. okay saturday we boarded up our windows and drew all over them funny stuff lol and just prepared for the storm. then we watched movies and played games and stuff and went to bed THEN at around 10:00 yesterday morning the power went out which sucked soo bad cuz it was hot and boring with no t.v. or computer. we seriously played cards for hours and hours. woo-hoo then during the storm me and victoria walked around my neighborhood in ponchos lol cuz we were so bored inside and walked down to my neighborhood sign but then we saw a police car so we had to go back home..lol. thenn everyone in my house was soooo bored so we decided to go for a walk since it stopped raining and we walked around palm lake elementary school. and since my mom works there she wanted to see the damage and stuff so we walked through the hallways and heard this like squeeling noise but we thought it was a bird but then we looked around the bushes and it was a kitty like the size of my hand it was the cutest thing i've ever seen. it was grey with white spots omg it was adorable. and we couldnt leave it there cuz it looked soo sad but my sister is allergic and my mom isnt a big fan of cats lol but i wanted it so we brought it home and put it in a cardboard box with towels and stuff. and gave it water and milk but it wouldnt drink it. it was breathing so hard and like shaking.. :( but this morning my sister took it to her friends house b/c they live on a farm and have alot of animals so she'd know what to do with it. i miss her. we named her jeanne..haha. were so clever. but yes that was my fun weekend and now im at my dads. i have practice tonight at flames from 6-8 and then after that i think im going to cristinas to spend the night. im soooo excited. i need to get out and plus i havent seen her since thursday..:( cant wait! <33

When i woke up this morning the arm that i got stung on was itching and it got really red and hot. then my whole body felt like i was on fire. i think i got an allergic reaction to it. it sucked really bad. 

Other then that, my day wasnt that bad. the classes sucked but geometry was so funny. me and Daniela were exchanging notes writing with our left hand. it was so funny haha my geometry teacher prolly hates us cuz the whole class he was like ""girls stop, stop now, stop talking' haha. oh welll

Now since this freakin hurricane is coming i doubt we'll have school on monday which in a way is good since school completely sux but its PJ day on monday! I dont want to miss that... i was so looking forward to it. THEN homecoming one week from tomorrow :-D! Me and sarah are getting our nails done on thursday after school. im excited.

This morning i was straightening my hair and practically burnt my ear off.. that was a sign my day was gunna suck!
So i get to school and got stung by a bee b4 school even started... yes that was a bee cristina, i didnt realize it til first period when my teacher told me it was :\ I was walking to first period and there were a few bees around me but they never bothered me so i just kept walking and i felt a pain in the back of my arm like i got a shot and then it got HUGE and hot and like my whole arm felt tingly and it stung. it was bad... great way to start off my day..

THEN i get to english and realize that i forgot my text book in my locker. lost a few points for that...:-\

Got to psychology where we had to do a skit and i kinda sucked at that and my arm was killing me so i was in a bad mood..

In chemistry were doing this thing called dimensional analysis where u have to convert like 83 mile/hour into how many centimeters per sec. stuff like that. our whole class was getting sooo frustrated cuz it looks easy but u have to show all ur steps and i was so confused.

Lunch was okay..

Then i had half a note for stina and i told her i'd give it to her but i didnt have time to finish and i feel bad cuz it was important. :-\

THENNN i get to geometry and notice that my backpack is SOAKED... yes the waterbottle from my backpack leaked and got on all my papers, cristinas important notes, my planner books everything and the bottom part was wet. i was pissed.

Finally when i got home im trying to work out plans to go to the jv game vs dp tonight but of courseeeeeeeee making plans SUCK! but oh well. im gunna go to aly's powder-puff football game at t.f.a! powderpuff football is awesome. i would SOO do that if our school had it. by the way.. ohs better win tonight... ;D"

Today was a pretty good day. i was in a good mood. the only reason though was because it was early day. i cant stand school. so many things about it i hate but theres nothing i can do about it so i'll stop complaining...

Then we took cristina back with us, lounged around the house then reilly and marcos came over. we hung out for a few hours, <b> straightened </b> marcos's hair!! =O and ate ribs...yum! it was a fun afternoon. after they left me and stina showered got ready and went to caffeine. i saw so many people there that i havent seen for SOO long. it was a fun night.

After caffeiene me and stina were pooped so we went to sleep pretty early like losers and woke up early of course. we woke up craving our fruity pebbles and my dad was at the grocery store when we woke up so when he came back, he didnt have them!! he said he couldnt find them?!? :( very sad so we had to eat somethin else. we were already fussy but by not having our fruity pebbles, we were major fussy..lol

Stina just left (very sad) and now im about to be lazy and bored ALLL day. yippee
Then the johnstons are coming over for dinner... it'll be fun.

<b>i hate school.</b>

Today in chemistry were starting to watch that movie ""October Sky"" about those boys who build the rockets. it was soo good and it has jake gyllenhaul in it and hes pretty cute!! i love this movie <33

School was pretty good today, i've been in a pretty good mood. a BIG change from last week. My output on life is <b>""who cares, life goes on, stay positive""</b> yea it sounds corny but its true. everytime i think something negative, i turn it to positive and it really helps. we waste our lives worrying about gay stupid stuff when in reality there are more important things going on.

tonight is homework and more homework. this is what i get for procrastinating on homework. im a bad procrastinator on everything. :\

I was talking to bryan earlier about halloween horror nights this year. yes im so freakin scared. i went not last year but the year b4 and was scared out of my mind. i went with cristina, sarah and elisa. sarah was the only calm one..haha but yet, she cant see exorcist?! hah anyways she was the one keeping us calm but it still didnt work. u know how your not suppose to run or then that will make them come after you even more? well of course i ran. and cristina seriously screamed at me so loud to stop running.. i was scurrred. lol. and in the midst of the chainsawing dudes running after me, i tripped and landed in a prickly bush.. oh the fun of HHN '02! haha This year will be fun i think. bryan and julien are going to keep us calm....hopefully!

I cant believe i got my homecoming dress, and all my jewelry in a day lol. this is big for me. i already have a purse (i think) and now i just need shoes. omg i LOVE my dress. Then when i was in the middle of buying my jewelry, the power went out in the mall from the storm this afternoon so they had to shut down the stores cuz people could steal stuff and they wouldnt know since the security things wouldnt work so we were bored for about 5 minutes lol then it came back on... it was kinda creepy. but anyways yea i cant wait til homecoming... its awesome how its at Hard Rock..:D

My grams is gunna be here tonight at my dads and then GAY school tomorrow which im SOO dreading... i hate school and on top of that i have geometry homework i still gotta do. grrrr

then at about 1 in the morning friday night, the power went out and woke everyone up so we couldnt really sleep. finally we fell asleep then woke up and went to my dads house (all 6 of us) cuz we had power there. so we were gunna watch movies but then OUR power went out..ahhhh. and my dads company has hotel rooms open at the ""Howard Johnson (ho-jo)"" hotel on I-drive so we went there yesterday afternoon. eww it was kinda gross and smelt bad but it was good since it had t-v's and air..lol. so we were fine. me and lauren spent 18 dollars on candy...haha. we were pigs!!

Later that night we talked on the phone for a bit watched sister act and fell asleep. woke up this morning, showered and found out that the johnstons got their power back so we came back here and now were all gunna go see ""Napoleon Dynamite"" lol. sucha funny movie. my dad and jenny wanna see it lol. 

Tonight im going back to my moms and tomorrow i think im gunna go dress-shopping with sarah and cristina...:D i wanna see them soo bad :( its gunna be fun.

Tomorrow me and stina are going to universal/IOA with bryan (the nerd!) and Julien. They are the best! We have so much fun with them... never any awkward moments or bad times. I cant wait. Were going to miss you sarah and courtney :(

I really really dont want to go back to school. Some people do but its so fun just relaxing around the house doing nothing or being with your friends. no worries about homework/tests or projects....:D i really hope they extend the break longer!! ;)

I was suppose to get up at 6:45 cuz i had to go get certified and since we were getting our badge and picture i had to like straighten my hair and all that good stuff so my alarm goes off and i fall back asleep next thing i know its 7:45! lol and my ride was coming at 8. i showered, got dressed and straightened my hair all in a matter of 15 minutes. thats big for me. so i got down to the hospital to get certified and it only lasted like 1 hour when it was suppose to be 3 and after all that we never got our pic taken! ahh! i was mad but i got home early and the lady was here at my house to cut hair so i got here in time and she trimed mine so now NO split ends YAY! lol

Tomorrow i have to go up to the ymca to meet with my squad and then monday :( the worst day lol. the rest of my summer will prolly suck lol cuz it'll be consisting of laying in bed looking like a run-over chipmunk lol. but hey it has to be done :\ 

Okay i may be a loser but in a way im excited for school to start. lol. i miss everyone and i wanna see them. Freshman year wasnt the best year cuz i was so focused on my grades and like getting to class on time that i didnt really have the real feel of 'high school' lol. these next 3 years will be better tho, i can tell.

in flight. 
Live through each wing tip't turn 
slipping, sliding, serenly on the current. 
Freedom to free fall 
or stall. 
Second hand satori. 
Fly without fear with binoculars.

Just letting you know, I'll be making a set of these simple pleasure poems and would love to hear feedback."

"event","I met a lost woman today when I was eating dinner at Fairfix- a ""hippy"" cafe. I didn't see her come in but she walked up and seemed to be begging for change from the couple behind me. She sat down at the table in front of me with a little kids cartoon bag. It was tiny and all ratted out, and even though she didn't pay it any attention I got the feeling that it was all she owned. She looked around with vacant eyes and just sat there. She didn't have food so she just sat and gazed out the window. She sent off waves of confusion and pain. 
I had just finished a page of Julia Butterfly's novel and I was feeling very connected, so when she weakly pleaded with the next couple leaving I pulled 2 dollars out of my pocket and handed it to her. 
""Thank you,"" she said, tucking the money away, ""You're very sweet."" 
""Your welcome, it's a gift. Just try to give it back to someone who needs it when you can."" 
She nodded like she knew exactly what I meant and felt a similar sentiment but then seemed to get distracted and forget. 
""Thank you,"" she said a second time, as if she'd lost the first from her memory. ""I need a pack of smokes. I'm trying to sober up and I really need a pack of smokes."" 
I smiled at her and said I completly understood. I told her she should take care of herself and get what she needed, although inside I wished she had needed something more healthy. 
She looked wistfully outside as a little girl skipt past. 
""There are so many kids. Their everywhere,"" she murmered, smiling. ""I love kids."" 
Because I figured she might need a freindly face to talk to I asked the obvious question: ""Do you have any kids?"" 
She began to reveal hersaelf to me, starting with: 
""I don't know."" 
She told me that she thought she might have had a heroin overdose a long time ago and she was still getting over it... and that she didn't know. She kept repeating that she didn't know. At the time I thought she was talking about kids and the possibility that she had one somewhere, but now I think it might have been more than that. 
I sat with her for about 10 minutes and she told me some about her pain. She told me that her mom had died 7 years ago, but she still missed her lots. She would repeat little things as she spoke, or compleatly forget what she was saying and regress to an earlier topic. 
She was also slightly rude for common conventions. I offered her the rest of my salad, which was still a very large portion but she kept saying that she didn't want to beg. Then she said that she had thought maybe I would buy her one. Then she turned around saying that she'd get some money soon and buy one for herself. 
""Maybe tomorrow."" 
And she left. 
One of the busboys had heard most of the exchange and I could see the guys all talking about it in the back. The couple who had initially denied her money stopped and said that I was very sweet for what I did. 
I just sat there wondering if I should have bought the poor woman a good meal. I feel like maybe I should have because I'm sure it would have been the first balanced meal she'd had in too long. But at the same time it wouldn't have done anything. She was too lost to be able to help herself, and she wouldn't take any lasting help from those who would offer. 
I cried all the way home knowing that she was suffering so much and I couldn't help her through it. It seemed like such a waste of life."

Shut out the world and just feel?
Warm  wet  pressure

"event","I have recently started the long and arduous project of throwing away all the crap that I have accumulated so that I may go to college crap free. What this purging process has taught me is very simple and straight forward: I have too much crap, I have always had too much crap, and throw crap away. I'm very disappointed in myself to learn that I am a horrible pack rat... I have 3 full boxes of books that I have read, and didn't necessarily enjoy, saved for god only knows what reason. I think that I simply keep them to have the memory of the experience of reading them... at the same time it's not like I'm ever going to read them again. In truth they are completely pointless.
Much more pointless seems to be the backup of makeup and other cosmetic products that I've kept. I have old colognes that my grandmother gave to me... because she too is a chronic pack rat who likes to pass off her leftovers onto me. I would not be surprised to learn that I have more than 20 different lotions of different scents/sparkles/skin rejuvenation secrets that I simply never use... They've probably all gone bad but it seems i couldn't get rid of them before. I mean... good god... what would happen if I suddenly discovered that I simply needed to have that 12 year old bottle of vanilla and musk shimmery moisturizer because there was a shimmery vanilla musk party... What if I had already thrown it away... I wouldn't be able to go to said pointless party... I would become a social pariah... God forbid. 
Good riddance to old rubbish... now I can actually clean my room... frightening thought... i haven't done that since 1997... eww."

"event","Have you ever learned something that you wish you could forget? I've found that when people tell you that you don't want to know they are usually right. And by the same token... if someone is trying to keep their secrets secret it's because it's none of your buissness. Sometimes when people get drunk they get overly friendly, or overly depressed, and they like to share things to get them off their chests. I feel like an intruded into their pain. I feel like I have crossed into a place that they would not like me to be... because it's their special place to revel in guilt and frustration. I feel tainted. And I pity them because they cannot know I know. Now they must endure my pity without knowing why. I need a time machine."

I have decided that in order to preserve the way of life I have grown so fond of complaining about in my speeches and such I will now go back and find a new job. a better one. and to signify the launching of this new campaighn I will go and write the rest of my paper for class."

I am kinda in the dumps about something I mean me and steph kissed today and it made me feel like I was going to throw up. please tell me that there is a cure for that I mean I dont think I have ever been so unatractted to someone in my life at a single moment. I wished I could run away jump in my car and drive to alexandras to see her ugly baby cat. it is so ugly it is cute. and that is scarey because at no point when you are you kissed should think to run and instead of thinking of her you would rather go see a kitten... not another girl although I wouldnt mind, but a KITTEN I am frightend and I doubt there is anything I could tell her that wouldnt brake her heart... I know that saying the flat out truth is right to do but there is no nice way of saying ""hey I think we should no longer come closer than 2 feet from one another and by the way has anyone else had the urge to throw up when you kissed them? just wondered"" yikes I am going to go get something cold to drink and watch old movies. looking foward to hearing from you-kyle.... scratch that....-Todd"

I don't know what to think. I am going to just keep working and doing my thing maybe I will start talking more soon around them. to tell the truth though during work is the only time of day I feel like I am around people who care about me. not saying Jake and carrie don't care it is just more like I feel like at work they actaully respect me I mean one of my bosses came to me for advise. Is not talking better for me? I think I might be better off with my lips sealed.

I know now that I am a fool for thinking I had ever been in love. but hey got some sort of life ahead of me? I never liked being an optimist but hey, I guess knowing that I don't know love makes me feel free in a way, like there is some sort of great big prize in the cerial box of life. and I have to say I might as well wait for it to come out on its own.

10) I should eat the rest of that strawberrie tart
9) I will go to the family reunion and try my best to feel good
8) amy should feel better and stop calling people who love to exersise freaks
7) new jersey should realize people love her *shakes fist*
6) I should take my aunt out for breakfast
5) finish writing this poem (and if requested will post it)
4) Punch Jake for drinking the last coke (literaly I swore to god I would)
3) hug my pops, (grandpa)
2) rig the guess how much candy game so that jake wins(I have rigged it 3 years running)
1) bake a dish for the family reunion and claim it was my brother again"

I don't understand why I even trusted some of these guys. I found out from jake that someone I trusted stabbed me in the back and I really just don't feel too great right now. my Aunt shirley is over from england right now and I am kind of hoping in some way that she would steal me away from this crap. like some kind of hero. of corse I am not sure I should be believing in heros right now. I doubt I have the right I have been kind of the opisite of a hero myself the last couple days or at least I was thinking until I realized that most of my friendships are dead. no one noticed I was gone.. oh yeah plus I found out some pretty crappy things that have been said about me behind my back, maybe giving up on dating for a while wasn't enough walking away from people alltogether wouldn't bring me any closer to feeling better either though. I just wonder where they ever really my friends? I know I tried to be a friend to them.

time in the water (not including showers) = 4 hours 30ish min.
time naked in or around waters = 3 hours 30ish min.
time working = 18 hours
time sleeping = 5 hours
time kissing girls = o.oooooooooooooo sec
time kissing boys = 18 min ish
time enjoying kissing boys = 15 min ish
time trying to figure out what happened = 3 hours
time cleaning room for english lady coming friday = 2 hours 12ish min. 

at least none of it was brought on by the sauce...
still not drinking...
not saying I wasn't tempted
well anyways I have had a very oddddddd weekend but at least today I had fun with work with alot of work... almost too much work. but anyways I have been playing a little bit of pso and that makes me sooo happy because of the cuteness of the rappys... something so beautiferious about rape
anyways I think that after everything that happened I am going to have to just lay down for a while seeing as I am stuck sleeping in the basement of doom... yes doom is the only word to describe how much it scares me in the backroom but after my dad hit my hand with a hammer. I have been premoted to sleeping on billiard room floor instead of super creepy backroom 

so over all I think that I need to go finish working on my journal about Homos, well I hope that everyone is doing well I am trying to work on posting more"

well this weekend promises to be something that royaly pisses me off. I have several fun events planned such as weeding, wireing and of corse the thing I like best, breaking the news to bob that his wife, is in fact dead, and no I am not joking about that last part, they said it would be best if I told him when he arives tomarrow because I was so close with them both which bassicaly means that my family and his friends are too god damn chicken to face someone they love and tell them such news, of corse I know how he reacted when I told him about erics death, first he punched me, then he hugged me, then we cryed I am hoping for this reaction to be as calm. I really love him and wish he didn't move away...

well other than that the good news is I am going to go to a BBQ on monday... with whit. 

oh and sarah a friend I knew from highschool actually complimented me on the way I look when I saw her at the movie theater the other day. It made me feel alot better. then I felt even better when I saw the movie Unleashed, it was infact kickass and even though he is like 80 I still love morgan freeman

on the bright side with me being a dork and all I do have the pleasent news that E's computer's renivations which I have been neglecting are going to be quite cheep to do

if you will excuse me I am going to go lay down and cry... I do not look foward to telling bob why did she have to die?

I will miss you and may your spirt Rest

""ok I will call if plans change"" says sean. *conversation ends* of corse I took him never calling as a sign that they were coming and sever hours later I decided it was infact a bad Idea to have baked brownies... sad men alone with brownies and video games...

well anyways I ended up staying up till 3 and beating kingdom underfire... 2 adictive mini games for a reward. anyways then my brother decides to play this morning and erase that file... no more mini games... but at least I still have the first 2 campains beat and half of one of the last 2. 

I have discovered my love of cheesy popcorn seasoning... on things other than popcorn... don't like how something tastes? there is a 2.56% chance that this stuff will make it better. so yeah I ended up getting 3 hours of sleep and waking up

at least before I went to sleep I got to wish ken's mom a happy mothers day. and this morning the same to mine... although I am currently downstairs avoiding the movie fried green toooommmmmaaaatttttoooos I liked it the first time I saw it but the last 82 viewings have not been as joyous but hey if she likes it let her go at it. because she doesn't question my watching the princesses bride everytime I have a tempermental day or I need to get away. infact she ushualy makes me popcorn....

"event","I have never though of myself as a ""good"" or a ""bad"" person. I have allways thought that I fell somewhere in the gray. Tonight I know that my indefernce has brought me down. as many of you know a few months ago my mentor, my friend, my only proof I came from my father, his brother Lezz had passed away. shortly after I broke down and hid my face from the world. I began to isolate myself and then I mett Kelly, my fall was quick, my friends left empty, and me, living an hour and a half from the house that my family loves. I was cought up in my selfish needs. when my gram fell ill and I ran, and lezz died, I forgot who my friends were. I became indiferent. I became ""bad"" now I truely don't believe that someone can be good or bad but I do know that when I knew what the right thing to do was and I made the choice that would keep me from being alone. I know now that I was wrong, I was not a good friend to the people who I have not spoken too in months. tonight I saw someone I have great respect for, I now want to say that I am truely sorry to all of my friends that I have been away from for so long and that I understand that some of you would rather not be my friend. I just wanted you all to know that I still love you, and that I am begining to live my life again as me."

"event","after watching The postman and seeing america brought back down to rubble and I thought out of the ash's would rise a new empire. Kaitopia the proud nation of Kyle. of corse it wouldn't be a democracy, we would have The republic of Kaitopia and screw this police and army are now combined into the Knights of Kaitopia. I think that we would rase our proud flag the symbol of Kaitopia the mighty Cow. we would of corse be a 3rd world contry after the fall. and then we must establish ourselfs as independent so unless we are being invaded we will not depend on inports so I will tax them through the roof. ah Kaitopia home of the numb, where nothing is ever acomplished and no one ever leaves. it is a wonderful place to be, a horible place to die"

I am scared there is hair litteraly melted to the power supply it needs to be replaced I am going through and cleaning and servicing all of her hardware though and making sure it doesn't get killed by cat hair... I am also thinking of changing her towers back fixture to prevent cat intake and vent in from the bottom and add a 1 inch lift so that it minimalizes cat intake... I also took apart my alarm clock but that was because it went off when I was finaly falling asleep thank you mom and dad for setting it so I make sure they wake up to go to church.... but hey alarm clocks are really amazing inside i would sudjest that you take apart yours too..."

"event","well as it would be I am going to try and start updating again, and again, and possibly a few times after that. as you all know or none of you know, I moved back because me and the kelly are through and me and the kelly are well shall we say she may or may not be angry or she may or may not be the source of alot of my anger. but after all this I have decided to go about making my livejournal a little bit more lively and i wanted to start by ""posting"" but this is still all in theory... well anyways after thinking breifly for a few min. i have decided that it may be time for me to start thinking about moving back out of the house... within the next few months i think it would be best... I mean I really need to be able to sleep next to someone... ever sense i have been sleeping in a bed alone... i have been well... not so much sleeping as staying in bed untill i pass out of exaustion or daybreak comes... this weekend has been odd sense my parents have returned... I am going to have to think of something to do tomarrow aside from my massive room revival product... I have gone to work on fixing the ""erika's"" comp and it is like it has sucked up an entire cat into the intake... If I didn't think it would kill the rest of it I would be using a lint brush... or 8. but at least it is been established that the parts don't need to be upgrated just need to be covered in less cat... so the plan of action is maybe to invest in a outer shell for her computers outer shell... either that or put up some sort of cat proff netting... kind of like what they use to kill dolphins... errr tuna... well I am going to try and remove as much of the hair as possible and see if I can think of a better cat proffing system but i am thinking she is either going to have to shave that cat or buy a new computer desk because I am afraid of any cat that has that much hair.... but yeah back to something not cat... I am thinking about investing in one of those beds now... better try and lay down and not sleep again tonight... although i did take a 3 hour nap when my parents were gone today... for somereason I sleep better knowing they are not around...someone fix my head and make it so my heart is not... shall we say ""making me hate myself"""

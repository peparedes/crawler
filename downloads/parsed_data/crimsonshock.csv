"event","It was a great week for Filipinos all over the world as two of our fellow men brought home recognition and honor.
First, Manny Pacquiao won his seventh boxing title and making it a history to be the first to have seven titles in different division.
Then, CNN named their Hero of the Year 2009, none other than Efren Pe&ntilde;aflorida. With his &quot;kariton klassroom&quot; aiming to teach children how to read and write with other co-volunteers. He gave a very heart warming speech that addresses all of us, all the people of the world.  
I hope the government would learn from this, not just acknowledge the recognition that Efren got, but we must start acting, helping those who are in need and continue what they have started. 
It only proves that everything starts with education. And we must give enough attention to that matter which we are lacking. 

Congratulations to Efren Pe&ntilde;aflorida, continue what you have started and may everyone be inpired by your self-less act.

"event","Glee is back equiped with very very good songs such as Proud Mary and Defying Gravity from Wicked the musical. A favorite books of mine because it's all about Elphie the wicked witch of the west in the Wizard of Oz. 
But when Glee sang their rendition of the song it brings a whole new meaning to it. Which is quite touching indeed. 

Listen to the song or sing a long, below is the lyrics. Enjoy! 
<lj-embed id=""20""/>

Defying Gravity 

[Rachel] 
Something has changed within me 
Something is not the same 
I'm through with playing by the rules 
of someone else's game 
[Kurt] 
Too late for second guessing 
Too late to go back to sleep 
It's time to trust my instincts 
Close me eyes and leap 

[Chorus - together] 
It's time to try 
defying gravity 
I think I'll try 
defying gravity 
Kiss me goodbye 
I'm defying gravity 
and you won't bring me down... 

[Rachel] 
I'm through accepting limits 
'cause someone says they're so 
[Kurt] 
Some things I cannot change 
But 'til I try I'll never know 
[Rachel] 
Too long I've been afraid of 
[Kurt] 
Losing love I guess I've lost 
[Together] 
Well if that's love 
It comes at much too high a cost 

[Chorus - together] 
I'd sooner buy 
Defying gravity 
Kiss me goodbye 
I'm defying gravity 
I think I'll try 
Defying gravity 
And you won't bring me down... 

I'd sooner buy 
Defying gravity 
Kiss my goodbye 
Defying gravity 
I think I'll try 
Defying gravity 
And you won't bring me down, 
Bring me down 

(applause!) 

Thanks to <a href=""http://www.4shared.com"">4shared</a> for the music."

Not so many people have this kind of heart and concern towards education and children. 
Our very own Efren Penaflorida is nominated as one of CNN's Hero of the year. With his pushcart classroom, he teaches children in the streets basic reading and writing together with his friends and volunteers. 

Our Nation needs people like them and example like him. Our government needs to realize this. Sure, it is a great honor to be nominated in this category. It honors Efren and the country. But what now? We must take action, continue and expand what they have started.

This only proves that everything starts with education, as simple as reading and writing."

"event","<span style=""font-size: small"">Reposted from my wordpress<br /><br />~~~~~<br />April 27, 2009<br /><br />Last month I've finished an anime entitled Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (Season 1) and Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 (Season 2) in as short as 2 weeks, mostly during the holy week. <br /><br />I was intrigued by the plot of the anime. It's been long since the local tv channels here aired some decent anime shows that appealed to me. <br />According to Wiki, the first season aired in Japan from October 2006 upto July 2007 and the second season ran from April 2008 to September 2008, just last year. I think the episode's currently running on Cartoon Network Adult Swim in the US. While here in the Philippines, I don't know if they've aired it on Animax. Sorry, our cable doesn't have any Animax or Hero channel, it's exclusive to other cable providers. <br /><br />Anyhoo, each season has a total of 25 episodes each with a moderate to fast paced story runs. To make this easier for me, I'd tell more about the anime by parts. <br /><br />First off... <br /><br /><strong>The Power of Geass</strong> <br /></span><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-454"" title=""code geass"" height=""169"" alt=""code geass"" width=""300"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion-20080425000941874_640w.jpg?w=300"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small"">It is an absolute power which is sometimes associated with the Power of the Gods. In the anime it is associated with power to command, influence emotion, perception and memory. It is represented by a red bird-shaped symbol when active. At first, it appears only in one eye and with continued use it increases power until it spreads in both eyes and becomes uncontrollable. <br />The geass also serves as the binding contract between the immortal and the human. The moment the geass reach its full power, the person can receive the immortal's &quot;Code&quot; which leaves a mark on his body and grants him power. The &quot;Code&quot; makes the immortal immune to geass and make his own contracts but it doesn't allow him to die. While the previous owner of the &quot;Code&quot; dies in the process of transfering the &quot;Code&quot;. <br /><br /></span><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>The Plot and Setting</strong> <br /><br />The series is set in an alternate universe where there are three Empires that ruled the world. The Holy Britannian Empire, The Chinese Federation and The Euro Universe. <br />It was the year 2010 a.t.b. (i don't know what a.t.b. stands for) after Japan was conquered by the Holy Britannian Empire and renamed as Area 11. In this era, Japan is the top producer of the high energy mineral called sakuradite. <br /><br />In this new area gained by the empire lived the exiled prince named Lelouch Lamperouge who gave up his claim to the throne and swore to destroy his father, the Emperor of the Holy Britannian Empire. In the process, he meets a young lady named C.C. and acquired the power of Geass of Absolute Obedience. He then became the leader of the rebellion and hid behind a mask and called himself Zero. He got three things to accomplish: revenge for his mother's death, to build a world where his sister Nunally can live and to fulfill the contract that goes with the geass. <br /><br /><strong>The Characters</strong> <br />Here are the characters that you would see from start to finish of the series. And the story mainly evolves around them. <br /></span><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-455"" title=""lelouch"" height=""112"" alt=""lelouch"" width=""150"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/lelouch.jpg?w=150"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Lelouch Lamperouge / Lelouch Vi Britannia</strong> <br />The 17th heir to the Britannian throne. He was exiled to Area 11 after his mother's assasination, Lady Marianne. He acquired the power of geass in an encounter between the military and Japanese rebels where he met C.C. After knowing of such power he used this control the military and lead the rebellion. <br /></span><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-456"" title=""suzaku"" height=""102"" alt=""suzaku"" width=""150"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/suzaku.png?w=150"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Suzaku Kururugi</strong> <br />The son of the late Prime Minister of Japan, Genbu Kururugi, and the chilhood friend of Lelouch. He became part of the Britannian Army and the Pilot of the Knightmare Frame Lancelot. He then gains the trust of the 3rd Britannian Princess Euphemia. He hides a secret that Lelouch would know eventually. <br /></span><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-457"" title=""C.C."" height=""93"" alt=""C.C."" width=""150"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/c2.jpg?w=150"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>C.C</strong> <br />An immortal green-haired girl that gave the power of geass to Lelouch in exchange of a contract, which isn't revealed until the second season.

She acts as a weak and frail student at the Ashford Academy but is actually one of the effecient rebels. She then becomes the head of Zero's Protection Batallion and pilots the Guren. <br /><br /><strong>The Knightmare Frames</strong> <br /><br />Knightmare Frames are humanoid war machines that replaced battle tanks. The knightmares are similar to the Gundams in terms of the look but they are very different in design and specifications. In the series, knightmares were introduced by the Britannian Empire and the Japanese and Chinese Federation debut their own in the middle of the series. <br /><br />A couple type of knightmares are the Lancelot, which Suzaku pilots, is made by Count Lloyd, a Britannian, and it is powered by the energy mineral sakuradite. <br /></span><span style=""font-size: small"">While the Guren, which Kallen pilots, is made by Rakshata an Indian Engineer who took the side of the rebels and she's a woman. The Guren is powered by radiation surge. <br /><br />As the story progress, the knightmares evolve into different generations, upto the 8th and 9th generation. The Lancelot evolved to Lancelot Albion and the Guren to Guren S.E.I.T.E.N. Both knightmares <br />became float systems that enabled them to fly. <br /><br /><br />Here is the list of the popular knightmares they used in the series. <br /><br /><strong>Britannian Knightmares</strong> <br /></span><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-463"" title=""gloucester"" height=""150"" alt=""gloucester"" width=""108"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/gloucester.jpg?w=108"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Gloucester</strong> <br />Weapon: Lance <br />Pilot: Viceroy Cornelia, Guilford, Darlton </span><br /><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-464"" title=""sutherland"" height=""150"" alt=""sutherland"" width=""150"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/sutherland.jpg?w=150"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Sutherland</strong> <br />Weapon: Drill, Chaos Grenade </span><br /><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-465"" title=""lancelot-albion"" height=""84"" alt=""lancelot-albion"" width=""150"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/lancelot-albion.jpg?w=150"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Lancelot Albion</strong> <br />Weapon: Dual Sword, VARIS(Variable Ammunition Repulsion Impact Spitfire), Float System <br />Pilot: Suzaku Kururugi <br /></span><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-466"" title=""mordred"" height=""84"" alt=""mordred"" width=""150"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/mordred.jpg?w=150"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Mordred</strong> <br />Weapon: Quad Hadron Canons, Automatic Multi Barrel <br />Pilot: Anya Alstreim <br /><br /><br /></span><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Japanese Knightmares</strong> </span><br /><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-467"" title=""burai"" height=""150"" alt=""burai"" width=""99"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/buria1.png?w=99"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Burai</strong> <br />Weapon: Slash Harken, Rifle <br /><br /></span><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-468"" title=""buraikai"" height=""150"" alt=""buraikai"" width=""91"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/burai.png?w=91"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Buraikai</strong> <br />Weapon: Light Saber </span><br /><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-469"" title=""gekka"" height=""105"" alt=""gekka"" width=""150"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/gekka.jpg?w=150"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Gekka</strong> <br />Weapon: Light Saber <br /></span><span style=""font-size: small"">Pilot: Kyoshiro Tohdoh, Four Holy Swords <br /></span><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-470"" title=""guren-seiten"" height=""84"" alt=""guren-seiten"" width=""150"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/guren-seiten.png?w=150"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Guren S.E.I.T.E.N.</strong> <br />Weapon: Nuclear Pulse Emiiter, Electrode Probe <br />Pilot: Kallen Kouzuki <br /></span><br /><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-471"" title=""gawain"" height=""150"" alt=""gawain"" width=""107"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/gawain.jpg?w=107"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Gawain</strong> <br />Weapon: Hadron Cannon <br />Pilot: C.C. and Zero (weaponry) <br /><br /><strong>Chinese Federation Knightmares</strong> <br /><br /></span><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-472"" title=""shen-hu"" height=""150"" alt=""shen-hu"" width=""150"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/shen-hu-air.jpg?w=150"" />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Shen Hu</strong> <br />Weapon: Electric Slash Harken, Chest-mounted particle canon <br />Pilot: Xing Ke <br /><br /><strong>The Ending</strong> <br /><br />Since the second season had ended last year, I could tell the ending. <br />But no, it's so much better to watch the series for yourselves and enjoy it.

Each Season has 13 night/episodes. The first season aired in Tokyo last April 2008 and the second season aired last October 2008. I just don't know if this aired in the Philippines. <br /><br />The manga is still running and now on it's 51st Chapter to be released this June. By the way, the anime version season 2 ended on the 49th chapter of the managa and they've shown it quite differently.</span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><font size=""3""><strong>Update</strong>:&nbsp; Now on Chapter 53 of the Manga. Would be one of the episodes for season 3? Hope so!</font><br /><br /><img class=""size-medium wp-image-619"" title=""season1"" height=""300"" alt=""Vampire Knight Season 1"" width=""200"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/06/season1.jpg?w=200"" />&nbsp;<img class=""size-medium wp-image-620"" title=""guilty"" height=""300"" alt=""Vampire Knight Season 2 Guilty"" width=""215"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/06/guilty.jpg?w=215"" /><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Now on to the summary of the anime. </strong><br />Vampire Knight is about a young girl named Yuki Cross who grew up with no memory of her childhood. The last thing that she could remember was the night when Kaname Kuran saved her from a vampire that was supposed to attack her. <br />Yuki was adopted by Kaien Cross, an ex-vampire hunter and Chairman of the Cross Academy. Years later, Chairman Cross brought home Zero Kiryu from a family who've been killed by a pure blood vampire, Shizuka Hio. <br />Yuki must discover what's hidden behind her past and her true identity and her connection to the vampires. <br /><br /><strong>Main Characters</strong> <br /></span><br /><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-625"" title=""yuki"" height=""225"" alt=""yuki"" width=""196"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/06/yuki1.jpg"" /><br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Yuki Cross/Kuran</strong> <br />She's the adopted daughter of Kaein Cross. She's also the Guardian of the Cross Academy along with Zero Kiryu. When Rido Kuran arrived at the Academy, Yuki's memories was unlocked and revealed that she's a pureblood vampire and the sister and fiance of Kaname. <br /></span><br /><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-616"" title=""kaname"" height=""206"" alt=""kaname"" width=""300"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/06/kaname_kuran_by_kouzumi22.jpg"" /><br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Kaname Kuran</strong> <br />A Pureblood Vampire and also the Night Class Leader. He protects Yuki since that night she saved her. It was revealed that Kaname is Yuki's brother and fiance. <br /></span><br /><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-617"" title=""zero"" height=""169"" alt=""zero"" width=""300"" src=""http://thebloggersden.wordpress.com/files/2009/06/zero.jpg?w=300"" /><br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong>Zero Kiryu</strong> <br />Born from a Vampire Hunter family, but was killed by a pureblood vampire named Shizuka Hio. Later in the series it was revealed that he has a twin brother which is taboo in vampire hunter families and that Zero is a vampire due to Shizuka's attack on him. <br /><br /><strong>Ending</strong> <br />Based on how I described the story and the characters, it's much more of a give away on what's the ending. <br /><br />Here are some information that I got from the anime. This is just on the authors point of view and not a general trivia. <br />1. Humans can be a vampire once bitten by a pureblood vampire. <br />2. Vampires follow certain hierarchy. <br />- Purebloods <br />- Noble Bloods <br />- Level D Ex-Human Vampire <br />- Level E Ex-Human Vampire <br /><br /><br />I just do hope that they make a 3rd season of this anime. But with just 2 chapter released after the ending, it would be a looooooong wait for the fans. <br /><br /></span>"

It's Ninoy Aquino day by the way.<br /><br />We walked out the mall to look for a place to eat. And we ended up at the SM Megamall Atrium. We stumbled on a friend and fellow alumni Owen who was the current supervisor of Eat &amp; Go. <br />Now on to the foodie.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/crimsonshock/pic/0005czbq/""><img height=""338"" border=""0"" align=""bottom"" width=""450"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/crimsonshock/pic/0005czbq/s320x240"" /></a><br /><strong>Gambaretti</strong> for starters. It's gambas minus the sizzling plate. The tomato sauce was a bit spicy but not that spicy enough for me. The prawns were tender and the bell peppers still had their bite that gives the dish its tangy flavor.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/crimsonshock/pic/0005dg8y/""><img height=""338"" border=""0"" align=""bottom"" width=""450"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/crimsonshock/pic/0005dg8y/s320x240"" /></a><br /><strong>Waldorf salad</strong>: lettuce, sliced apples, chickens and walnuts and of course the dressing.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/crimsonshock/pic/0005e5q3/""><img height=""338"" border=""0"" align=""bottom"" width=""450"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/crimsonshock/pic/0005e5q3/s320x240"" /></a><br /><strong>Steak and Mushroom,</strong> stir fried beef slices and mushrooms in brown sauce.

The pasta was delish, it has a minty flavor, according to my sister.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/crimsonshock/pic/0005faf4/""><img height=""338"" border=""0"" align=""bottom"" width=""450"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/crimsonshock/pic/0005faf4/s320x240"" /></a><br /><strong>Parmesan Crusted Salmon</strong> with curried rice and corns &amp; carrots.

Maybe not the best paella that I've tasted but nevertheless it's good! With mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari and chorizo in long grain rice. I love the tomato chunks in it. This is good for 2-3 persons and we have to take home the rest of the dish.<br /><br />Aside from these, they have Pasta and Sandwiches like Salmon Pesto (I must try this one next, I'm such a sucker for pesto!) and the classic Clubhouse.<br />They also have London Pies! Oh yes, London Pies! We haven't tried it but seems promising. Comes in Juicy Steak, Salmon &amp; Spinach, Chicken &amp; Basil, Primavera, Ham &amp; Cheese, Pork Barbecue, Paella, Chicken &amp; Chorizo and Chicken &amp; Ham. Available in single order with choice of one or two side dishes.<br /><br />We were so full and it's a miracle that we didn't order any desserts! Anyhoo, here's their line of sweets, Fudgy bar ala mode, Caramelized banana cake and Fruity salad. <br /><br /><strong>Eat &amp; Go</strong> is owned by Burgoo group of restaurants. It is located at the 3rd floor of the Megamall Atrium, in front of Bigbys.<br />Open on mall hours and they have <strong>delivery</strong> but <strong>within the Ortigas area only.<br /></strong>Call them at these numbers: 635 5995 or 632 9260<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","This day is full disaster!

We had our food delivered from KFC. So I called and placed the orders and specifically asked for an O.R&gt; (official receipt) to be named under our company.
The operator told me that it would be delivered&nbsp;within 45min - 1 hour.

So we waited...

45 minutes..no sign yet.

1 hour...still no sign of it.

I called again and asked why it's taking them so long. The operator apologized for the inconvinience. I asked from what branch it would come from. It would be just from their Pasig, Kapitolyo branch. 
Wow! it's soooo near to our building and yet it took them more than 1 hour to deliver our foods!

When the rider arrived, I checked if the items are complete. 

Almost! There's one thing missing! The O.R.! (Official Receipt) that I've specifically requested!
I asked the rider where's the O.R.? He simply said &quot;wala po eh.&quot; (there's none)

What?! 

I showed the rider the printed request at the bottom of the receipt.
Notes: PLS ISSUE MANUAL OR UNDER S**** A***

It would be okay if the rider apologized. but no! 
He told me, &quot;bakit galit kayo?&quot; (why are you mad?)

What?! (again!)

He was plain rude! When I called for the food I asked for an O.R. and I have proof. Because it was indicated in the receipt that was with the foods.!

Oh my God! My tummy aches as well as my head!"

It shocked us all when we heard the news a few minutes ago from an office mate. So we have to research for it to know if it's really true. And sadly...it is. We saw the news in websites like abs cbn entertainment and pep.ph.

He died around lunch time today at the Medical City in Ortigas after months of battling to survive.
I thought the last time he had a surprise guesting at &quot;eat Bulaga&quot; that he was doing well and responding to his chemotherapy.

This is a real shock.

And he sang Hero, he sounded more like David Cook I'd tell yah. The top girl was Alexis Grace, great great blues singer. She sang Never loved the man, i love her pink highlights. And the third placer was Michael Sarver the Oil Rigger and he sang I don't want to be, but I think Bo Bice's version was better.</p><p>Oh well, Anyhoo group 2 was up last night on a 2hour special, it was soooo long! I was like has it ended yet? hahahaha!<br />Only a few stood out and that includes Adam Lambert, Nick Mitchell a.k.a. Norman Gentle, Allison Iraheta and Megan Corkey. <br />I wouldn't expect anything less from Adam Lambert, I mean c'mon! He's a theater actor he knows how to give a good show. Bias! hahahaha! As for Norman Gentle, he'd make a wonderful theater actor. He's so funny and knows how to entertain with his comedic acts. But I agree with the judges, his stage is not the Idol stage.<br />While the girls, Allison Iraheta was sooooo like Kelly Clarkson. I was like watching a younger Kelly last night, do you think another style like that would win the title? By the way, she sang Alone and I think Carrie Underwood nailed that song 5 seasons ago. <br />And then there was Megan Corkey, she was so adorable last night with the baby dress and doll shoes and that &quot;Corkey Twist&quot; or dance, whatever that was. She did have very good vocals and knows how to control it. Although I wasn't familiar with her song, it sounded so beautiful and pleasant to the ears.</p><p>I'll just have to wait who get through to the next round and the Top 12 of the season.

And here's a <a href=""http://www.speedtest.net"">speedtest</a> of the connection.<br /><br /><img alt="""" align=""bottom"" src=""http://www.speedtest.net/result/415837906.png"" /><br /><br /><br />wohooo!"

"event","<br />Nights ago I was thinking of nothing and just staring at a blank paper. Then my best friend came across my mind.<br />That's how it all started. It's not merely based on our friendship but of two individuals far different from what we had. I can't think of any title for this one though. Any suggestions?<br /><br />~~~~~~~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~~~~~~~~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I&rsquo;ve been sitting for a while outside a coffee shop somewhere at the fort. I looked around me and realized how beautiful the place was. I&rsquo;ve been here a couple of times before but only this instance that it looked way much better. Even the people going in and out of the place don&rsquo;t seem to break the tranquility.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">Then my sight caught a figure of somebody approaching where I was seated.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">My best friend. Tall, fair complexion and nice face features.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I haven&rsquo;t seen this guy for so long and I couldn&rsquo;t even believe he&rsquo;s walking towards my table.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;So, what catastrophe brought you here?&rdquo; he simply said smiling.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">Then and there I knew nothing&rsquo;s changed. We started catching up on our lives because we haven&rsquo;t seen each other for almost five years.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">We&rsquo;ve become best friends way back our high school days when boys at school bullied me for being chubby and all. He was my shield defending me from all the names the kids at school been calling me. Until we reached college, we went to the same university but different courses. Nonetheless, we made sure that we still have time to see each other. He was there when I started to loose weight and become a woman. I missed him so much and now finally he&rsquo;s here.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">He was asking me about my recently ex-boyfriend when his cup of hot tea arrived. He doesn&rsquo;t drink coffee but insisted on meeting up in a coffee shop.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I looked at my strawberries n&rsquo; cream frappe and took a big slurp before answering.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;Half a year.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;How &lsquo;bout the one before him?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;Two years. But that&rsquo;s a different case and you&rsquo;d know all about it. That is if you&rsquo;ve been reading my emails.&rdquo; then another slurp on the frappe trying to hide my face.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;Get what? Why I always end up being dumped? To think that I&rsquo;m the girl.&rdquo; now I&rsquo;m beginning to raise my defense from my defender. Bah!</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">He looked at me straight in the eye. I swear my face felt so hot I tried to ignore as much as I can to look back at those gorgeous set of deep brown questioning eyes.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;What is it that you always do when you feel something&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked, his stare never leaving my face.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;To be honest&hellip;nothing. But I try to find a way to get the message through. Unfortunately, they always take it the wrong way. And when they do, they get the wrong impression and never gave me a chance to explain what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo; I felt my cheeks burn and my sight started to blur preparing for the tears.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;Hey cry baby.&rdquo; He was laughing. Really laughing hard that he had shown his perfect set of teeth. I missed how that laugh sounded.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;You still haven&rsquo;t changed. Always the cry baby I knew. I wonder who were with you every time you cry.&rdquo; he said teasing me with a choco chip cookie.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;Nobody but myself!&rdquo; tears held back I grabbed the cookie from him.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&quot;Strong girl. But still a cry baby.&rdquo; he smiled.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">And we laughed.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;So when&rsquo;s the big day?&rdquo; I asked while munching on the cookies.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;This May, on the 8<sup>th</sup>.&rdquo; he answered me and stare out of the glass walls.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s one lucky girl huh. I bet you&rsquo;re both happy.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;Yeah, very happy.&rdquo; he&rsquo;s still staring out of the wall with no happiness on his face.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;Why the sad face?&rdquo; You&rsquo;re supposed to be happy. Or is that the new face of excitement?&rdquo; I started to giggle to make him smile.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">But instead he gave me that stare, that meant something&rsquo;s not right. The mood changed.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not long before were married but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;But what? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; I began to worry. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine my best friend&rsquo;s wedding to disaster. No, not his.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;Something old, something I thought I&rsquo;ve forgotten. It came back.&rdquo; he was staring at me seriously.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;Uh-oh. Not that serious right?&rdquo; I was trying to contradict his mood.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&ldquo;No. All along I thought I&rsquo;ve forgotten her. But that day, it made me realize I had to see her again to know.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I backed away.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p>to be continued..."

"event","to sitting on your couch late at night, catching eyes. wondering how your hair got to be that color. 
i expect from birth, since the home videos we watched last night showed you at two pushy and bright wearing that same exact shade.
i can't quite wait to make it back to that room, the one that haunts my words every time i lay a finger to the keyboard. 
i'd never think that a pop song had any practical use, but Katy Perry's &quot;hot and cold&quot; always made me think of you, even before the three AM texts started again.
and when i watched you play guitar, drunk and loud but full of rhythm, i forgot to ask you to play the song you wrote, the one i always listen to. sometimes in the bathtub.
&quot;i've had you so many times but somehow i want more&quot;
i've never met someone who turned me on as much as you. i think we must be soul mates."

i've never felt so alive, dancing with my arms in the air, throwing my head back, laughing with my mouth wide open, rows of porcelain teeth. greeting the early morning hours with nothing but a smile and the body heat of interlocked fingers.
""one too many drinks tonight and i miss you like you were mine""
hoping fences in strapless bras and superman underwear, duck for cover, run across the landscaping, head first into the deep end.
long conversations in lukewarm water.
""he's gunna come round soon.""
thank god i'm leaving, eh? i don't know how much more of this i have in me, probably more than is normal. 
i'm going to go make a pot of coffee."

in lieu of doing what i wanted tonight i watched an enveloping documentary.
i miss your stuttering. it makes you sound nervous even though i strongly doubt you are, you've done this so many times before.
i miss watching really bad movies with you.
i miss it being so dark that i couldn't see where to walk. and i miss driving my car over the bushes in an attempt to turn around.
i miss your body. and your tattoo. and your back. and the fact that you wear dress pants and sweaters everyday.
i miss your hands all over my body knowing exactly what i want. i miss you memorizing the curves of hips and muscles and ribs and legs. you know that i can be read like a map in capable hands, that i need someone to learn my body like their own, with the curiosity of children just starting school.
i miss finding my clothes wedged between couch cushions with bottles and packs of cigarettes and telephones and god-knows what else.
why am i doing this to myself again?
i am already in way too deep. i have so much to say that i should really just quit while i'm ahead."

1. i am running very late for nothing. thus i will stay out later than i should, sleep in later than i should and repeat. waste.
2. i am wearing leggings that do not cover nearly enough of my rear end.
3. i am reading other people's words that could have been mine two years ago. is it a coincidence that i hate my past self and future self and current self along with the selves that wrote all those words? all those kids that love getting arrested and getting drunk and kissing boys. are they me or them? insert curse word here.
4. i'm confused and i haven't done my hair or makeup yet.
5. some days i stop and look at the floor and seriously debate whether or not i'm going insane. the floor moves under my eyes.
6. i want to make music.

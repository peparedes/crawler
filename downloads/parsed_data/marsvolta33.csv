"event","there's a barbara walters special on religion on right now.  seems to be focusing a lot on atheism.  frankly, i can't believe how they're portraying them; they picked only the assholes, it seems, who say ""I KNOW THERE ISN'T A GOD AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD BELIEVE IN ONE.""  they do the clever slow zoom, making them seem sinister.  now they're talking near death experiences.  a quote: ""there is not proof that it doesn't exist - [so] it exists!""  pretty much sums up the special.  what a load of shit.
i'm an atheist, for a number of reasons.  for one, the presence of a ""god"" is something i've never felt, or at least never recognized as god.  a lot of people i know who believe cite ""feeling"" god's presence as a reason they believe, so there's strike one.  i also just cannot wrap my mind around it; one being being able to control everything, all knowing, all powerful.  it seems a bit fatalistic to me.  also, i feel it's limiting.  why believe in the power of god when i can believe in the power of nature, and more importantly, of myself?

back to music tomorrow, i promise."

"event","so i've become mostly bored with telling people my emotions, so i'm going to turn this into a music blog, talking about songs/albums i'm into at the time.
to start it off, we've got Yes' ""Close to the Edge.""  I'm only going to discuss the song, not the album, since I haven't listened enough to And You and I or closely enough to Siberian Khatru.
I think this song is brilliant; plainly put, Yes' best recorded work - better than Roundabout, better than I've Seen All Good People, better than South Side of the Sky.  The song is long - 18:41, and starts and ends with some synth sounds and birds chirping, which is a bit boring, but I'll be damned if it <i>feels</i> long.  As I said, the setup can be boring, but it feels appropriate.  Like Roundabout or South Side, there's a long musical interlude surrounded by chorus/verses, standard Yes fare.  
What I think separates this song from the others I've mentioned is just how spot on the band is on the recording.  The song itself is, as expected from Yes, beautiful, but moreover, especially towards the end, it is the most adrenaline-filled, intensely climactic piece I've ever heard from them.  When it starts going, the energy that Bruford and Howe especially convey is just astounding.  Everything with this song seems spot on.  Check it out."

"event","my quarter was basically going nowhere until five weeks ago.  the wednesday before i left for home for the first time, i found out (in a rather surprising manner) that the girl i'd had an incredible crush on for the year before...  apparently, she was into me, too.  
in five weeks, i fell in love.  in five weeks, i remembered.  hell, in five weeks i completely forgot; i stopped comparing her to anyone in my life.  and now (of course) she's gone.  my mom could tell; my family can always see right through me.  i almost stayed for her, and i really considered doing it.  this is all vague; this all sounds like i'm in high school again, but maybe that's a good thing.  in high school, at least for some parts, i was really happy.  i wasn't grasping for happiness, wasn't trying to find it where it wasn't.  if anything, i was trying to find reasons to be unhappy and i couldn't.  
i like being happy.
more importantly, i love her.  already, i can't wait to see her again."

FURTHERMORE, Casino Royale is an incredible movie.  The more I talk about it, the more I love it.  Craig plays a brilliant Bond; he's new to the 00 rank, unsure of what to do, still figuring himself out.  It does include a particularly brutal torture scene, but goddamn.

adam gave me p

parachute - one of my fondest memories of public school, way way back in 1st and 2nd grade, was playing that awesome game where you were given a big unfolded parachute and everyone waved it and you would run under all at the same time and grab the edges and hold them down and slowly the parachute would deflate.  just how everything looked under that, with all those colors and the sun shining through.  it was pretty.

pity - such a sad word, isn't it?  i used to try to get people to pity me, i think, because getting them to actually like me was far too hard.  i think i've grown out of that by this time.  hopefully.  :)

participate - something i've found myself unable to do recently in class, mostly because of this state of nasty depression i've been in recently.  i don't like talking in groups anymore, it makes me nervous and i just don't express myself well anymore.  oh well.

parlez-vouz francais? - i don't know if i spelled that correctly, because i don't speak french.  so, if you're tempted to start speaking french to me, ask that question first, then realize i will answer with 'no,' and then say whatever the hell it is in english.  i'm ignorant, yes, i know.  too bad.  this sort of leads me to my next word...

pretension - i've been using this word <b>a lot</b> lately, because pretension has been pretty much staring me in the face since september.  i did my best to ignore it, but ugh, school is just damn full of it.  oh well, i probably contribute to that.  i should watch myself.

pebbles - i'm running out of p words, but i could use some cereal.  post fruity pebbles or post cocoa pebbles?  YOUR VOTES WILL DECIDE

prog rock - a certain genre of music i've been really getting into lately.  king crimson, a certain bit of yes, maybe even a little bit of genesis (back when peter gabriel was still the singer).  i am hovering somewhere between proud of my musical growth and ashamed.

palpate - i've been reading naked lunch for class, and it's in there a few times while discussing some std.  it popped into mind.

paranoia - everybody's coming to get me...  i get paranoid sometimes, that my friends are conspiring against me, that people are talking about me behind my back...  but maybe a little bit of paranoia is healthy, yeah?

predator - it was a good movie i guess.  i can't think of words, dammit."

playing frisbee last night at 11 in the rain and the fog, i glanced up and saw the biggest, most beautiful constellation i had ever seen.  of course, the city lights are far too bright for there to be any real stars.  actually, it was just lights in the apartment building across the street, some bright, some dim, working together to create the illusion of a constellation.
for those few seconds, though, between when i saw it and when i realized what it was, i felt alright being here.  after i realized what it was, i felt homesick.

<i>Mistah Kurtz - he dead</i>
I

We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rats' feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar

Shape without form, shade without colour,
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;

Those who have crossed
With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom
Remember us -- if at all -- not as lost
Violent souls, but only
As the hollow men
The stuffed men.

II

Eyes I dare not meet in dreams
In death's dream kingdom
These do not appear:
There, the eyes are
Sunlight on a broken column
There, is a tree swinging
And voices are
In the wind's singing
More distant and more solemn
Than a fading star.

Let me be no nearer
In death's dream kingdom
Let me also wear
Such deliberate disguises
Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves
In a field
Behaving as the wind behaves
No nearer --

Not that final meeting
In the twilight kingdom

III

This is the dead land
This is cactus land
Here the stone images
Are raised, here they receive
The supplication of a dead man's hand
Under the twinkle of a fading star.

Is it like this
In death's other kingdom
Waking alone
At the hour when we are
Trembling with tenderness
Lips that would kiss
Form prayers to broken stone.

IV

The eyes are not here
There are no eyes here
In this valley of dying stars
In this hollow valley
This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms

In this last of meeting places
We grope together
And avoid speech
Gathered on this beach of the tumid river

Sightless, unless
The eyes reappear
As the perpetual star
Multifoliate rose
Of death's twilight kingdom
The hope only
Of empty men.

V 

Here we go round the prickly pear
Prickly pear prickly pear
Here we go round the prickly pear
At five o'clock in the morning.

Between the idea
And the reality
Between the motion
And the act
Falls the Shadow 

For Thine is the Kingdom

Between the conception
And the creation
Between the emotion
And the response
Falls the Shadow

Life is very long

Between the desire
And the spasm
Between the potency
And the existence
Between the essence
And the descent
Falls the Shadow
For Thine is the Kingdom

For Thine is
Life is
For Thine is the

This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper.

Unfortunately, I couldn't really check it out, but after coming home from work and e-mailing Georgia, I read around and it seems there were no injuries.  Phew.
Work is rough.  It's a pretty easy job, in that it entails sitting around on my ass most of the day, but sitting ten hours in a car is a drain on my psyche and my gas tank, neither of which are very good.  Still, it pays more than enough to cover my gas bill, so that's good.
I wrecked my knee last night.  Thanks Marc.  Hopefully it'll be better by next week or so.

"event","As most, if not all of you know, we (my mother and father), along with my father's business partner Rob, have begun renting an apartment in New York City.  This past weekend, we went up there for the first time as a family.
We got down there Saturday evening after my mom and I took a train from Wilmington.  I was pretty tired, so after a quick stop at the market for some dinner, I settled down on the internet and watched Degrassi all night.  Good show.
Sunday, I met up with my friends Ian and Mer.  Ian and I met around noon at Town Hall on 43rd between 6th and 7th to pick up some tickets for a free concert the local classical station was putting on.  After that, we headed back to my apartment to bask in the glorious air-conditioning.  Later, we went to a comic book store right by the Empire State Building.  I ended up only purchasing an Aqua Teens t-shirt, but I think next time I'll get the Crisis story-arc book.  Sunday was also the day of the gay pride parade, which lasted for at LEAST six hours.  There were plenty of dance-party busses, transvestites, and one man wearing a butterfly costume.  After stopping back at the house for a quick bite, Ian and I went to Town Hall to meet up with Mer.  The concert we saw was a performance by a solo percussionist named Evelyn Glennie.  It focused mainly on marimba, though she included one recital piece for concert snare which was amazing, and included an open roll which must have lasted seven minutes, speeding up and slowing down.  With every stroke, you could hear her concentration.  The marimba things she did were equally amazing.  The most amazing thing, of course, is that she is profoundly deaf and ""hears"" music by feeling the vibrations.  After that, we went back home, and Ian and Mer met my family, along with Uncle Rob, his daughter Lizzy, and Lizzy's two friends.  We went to dinner at a nice Thai restaurant where I had some delicious beef with broccoli.  After that, Ian and Mer headed home, and I settled in for a final night of Degrassi.
Then we came home.  Long story short: Traffic."

"event","I've been slowly becoming more and more aware that I can be very rude and mean to people.
Please be aware that most of the time, my rudeness and unkindness is entirely unintentional.
I don't know if it's because I've just never become properly adjusted socially, or because I am just damn ignorant of others' feelings, but honestly, to anyone I've insulted, I apologize.

I go through phases, when I get depressed, and one of those phases is a terrible feeling that in my life, I've become stuck in neutral, unable to experience anything new in my life.  It's the worst part, I think; it's not a feeling of sadness, but melancholy.  I feel like I've done everything in my life.  It's not any sort of great feeling of accomplishment, but just that I'm not going to do anything new in my life.  I stop seeing the fun in things I really do enjoy - being with my friends, my family, even the simple happiness I take in being alone.  And the worst part is, I try so hard to change things, I come up with huge, fantastical ideas and never have the drive to actually make them happen.  I start to sleep all day just trying to escape the routine of my life.  I bounce back eventually, but I end up insulting and offending my friends and family by making them think I don't appreciate them.

Please realize that I do appreciate you, all of you.  I'm truly sorry that I can be such a little bitch to you all; I treasure our time together and wouldn't trade it for the world."

Hitchhiker's Guide was a really good movie.  It might not have been as good as the book, but I thought some of the things in it, all of which seemed to be the brainchildren of Douglas, were phenomenal.  The spaceship Heart of Gold was a beautiful, Death Star-esque globe with a wonderfully hollow center.  The Vogons were great, and all of the characters were well-played.  The chemistry between all of the actors was there, too, and it really shower.  It was very interesting to me to see the characters brought to life in a visual sense (I say that because they were all so vibrantly alive in the books), specifically Zaphod and Marvin.  Mos Def was over-the-top sometimes, and I initially was annoyed, but I think it was pretty perfect for someone with no concept of what it is to be human.

AP tests this week, after which half of my classes will be finished.  Day 4, I won't even have to go to school.  After that, it'll just be Myth, Relationships (ugh), and Latin.  Fortunately, the only class I don't like of those, and indeed the only class this year I haven't found myself enjoying, is Relationships.  We've just begun the sexuality portion of that class, which should be highly amusing, at the very least.

Girls Gone Wild seems to be the epitome of this culture's obsession with avoiding sexuality, speaking of the subject (and having just seen a commercial for said product).  Yes, it's entirely about tits and ass and all of that shit, but there isn't even a hint of real sexuality.  There's no concept of a story, even one as weak as in most pornography.  Instead, it's just a montage of girls lifting up their shirts, pulling their shorts down or their skirts up to show their thongs, or lack thereof.  They're not human.  It's like extreme slave fetish, domination to the point of a loss of identity.  Do the girls realize this?  Is that why they're okay with it?  Will their excuse simply be ""Oh, I was so drunk, I wasn't myself.""?"

I woke up confused, for the first time in a very long while, as to what had really happened, and what hadn't.  It took me a good half-hour to sort it all out.

I feel so motherfucking conflicted - on the one hand, I like where I am, I like living, simply put.  On the other hand, I can't wait till next year, till college, wherever I go.  I can't wait for the freedom and for the new people, new experiences, new opportunities that might be ahead.
And of course, when it comes to that, I get scared and nervous as I always fucking do.  Will I be able to handle it?  All of this keeps going through my head.  It's not enough to keep me up at night, not nearly enough, but every now and then, it's powerful enough to make me pause for a second and just think - what if?  I thought I'd gotten past that, past the point where I lived in the past or in the future, and to the point where I really and completely lived in the right here, right now.  I thought I'd gotten past the what if's in all aspects of my life, but every now and then something pulls me back to it.
I've been treating the people in my life pretty shitty recently, and I'd like to apologize.  There are things going on that you may or may not understand, but honestly, I do not want to talk about them.  This isn't a cry for help, this is a reason."

While I fully enjoy shopping at thrift stores, and condone it, as it is a good way to get clothes cheap, I think calling it ""thrifting"" cheapens it, makes it seem different from shopping for clothes, which is what you're doing.  Sure, it sounds cooler and more indie or whatever to call it thrifting, but it's really just shopping.  It's just like calling something antiquing seems pretentious, it's just shopping for old shit that has no use.  You don't call shopping for food fooding, and don't start now.  Just call it shopping, there's no reason to point out WHERE you're shopping.

I need to figure out what to do with my life.  I'm really thinking music production is my calling...  I don't know what to do about college, though.  I have a lot of choices, which is not to say I'm an exceptional student or anything, there are just a lot of colleges out there.  It's really scary, to be honest.  I visited a few colleges this week, Fordham, NYU, and Manhattanville.  Fordham seemed cool, my kinda-cousin Andrew has a lot of fun there.  NYU seemed big, though the dorms were small in a cruel contrast, but they have a major which recognizes the music producer as an artist, which is tempting, and Manhattanville was just kind of... boring.  I feel bad saying that, like I'm going to offend people there, but it just does not seem like the kind of environment for me.  I'm sure it is great for the students who go there, though.  
I've hung out with Georgia a lot lately, to the point where both our parents thought we were dating.  We're not.  We're just good friends, and that is actually very satisfying.  She's really easy to talk to, and get along with.  Great fun.

Last Friday, my laptop had stopped working, and since it was not working any better Monday, I decided to do something about it.  The trackpad is broken, it seems, so I have to send it in, but thankfully, Apple customer support is the nicest bunch of people on the face of the earth, so they sent me a box and such to send back to them.  I must send that this weekend.  
I got my report card, and my parents were enraged at the three seventies and the three missing assignments comments.  Oh well, I don't really care, I suppose.  
I've come to realize that I have a problem with one or two of the teachers at my school.  This isn't some sort of immature ""My teacher sucks,"" kind of thing, I can handle that, some people are more able to teach than others, and it is something I can grow to accept.  I just suppose that on a personal level, I do not get along with one or two of my teachers.  I have no problem coming to terms with the fact that I am not actually the smartest person at my school.  I am very happy to admit that I have no common sense, really, and I understand the occasional need to remind me of that, I suppose.  But it is just unneccesarily insulting to talk down to me the way one teacher at my school does.  I am unsure of what his disagreement with me is, but since we have gotten to know each other, he has never been actually kind to me, and is only on rare occasions civil.  Therefore, I try to avoid contact with this certain teacher as much as possible, just to keep tensions low.  Sometimes, however, direct contact is needed, and this very frequently ends in his becoming exasperated with me, and treating me like an idiot.  I, personally, see no need for this, and I think I may talk to him about it, especially because he is also involved in something I enjoy very much, and would hate to have my experience in it wrecked by personal disagreements with a superior.
In band news, we received our parts for the opener.  I am on rack, unfortunately.  I was really hoping I would get a core part this year, but that is not happening.  Oh well, there go my dreams of glory for my senior year.

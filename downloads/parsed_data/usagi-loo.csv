"event","since I've descovered the mobile version of this I'm tempted to use it more often. I've thought about deleting it, seeing as I cringe when I go back and read how rediculous I sounded and what I complained about back then but I can't bring myself to do it. So I'm thinking I'll just make all my new posts public and pay the 15 dollars to get a name change on here. Kind of like giving myself a livejournal fresh start without losing my gramatically incorrect, whiney past.

I'm not sure if anyone still uses livejournal but friends if you're still on here lemme know! That means you danielle, lindsay, everyone! Let me know if its worth it to start using this again.

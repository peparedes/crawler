Today- Hung out with some awesome co-workers from the coffee shop (high school girls that are still pretty kickass, I showed them around the college and they were amazed). Tonight I applied to Fitchburg successfully for next fall, and now I'm watching Stranger Than Fiction and hoping for a relatively early night.

Tomorrow- Classes (wide awake with lots of sleep), and then work. After work, Katie is having a party. Jay and I, and possibly Erik/Matt/Sara are all going.

Wednesday- Conference for my final composition portfolio from 8:15am-8:30am, then done for the day. Going to see Urinetown that night, and Jen is probably coming up for dinner and to watch the show!

Thursday- Classes and work as usual. Packing up.

Friday- No class Friday, taking an 8am bus home to Manchester. Getting a ride to Nashua, somehow, for the CON!

This weekend- CON!"

I talked to a few friends online and felt great, and then... all of a sudden, for some reason, I feel absolutely miserable and lonely and all I want to do is cry. I feel like I have a million friends, but not a single ""real"" friend who I can talk to about this, and I know that's probably irrational. I miss my dad, I miss my family, I miss my friends.

"event","I threw the hairbrush at him. It caught him in the forhead, just above the eyebrow, and his hands rose quickly, covering his pain struck face. I thought, unexpectedly, of how his face looked when we made love, the same sudden wrench of agony at the end. I stood up and walked across the bed. Standing above him, I hit ihm several more times before he turned to me and pulled me down. He held me gently, sitting on the edge of the bed, as if I were a child. He was crying again. I understood that he thought I was angry because he'd hurt me, and I tried to cry, too, but I couldn't. I felt miles away from my body, from his sorrow. I was thinking all the wrong thoughts, I knew. I was thinking that now everyone would believe that this was why we were getting divorced. That our kind, careful separation would be public property, would be explained by this ugly twist. That I would seem what I wasn't-- an enraged, abandoned wife. I let Brian hold me and comfort me because of the pain he thought he was causing me, and felt nothing, felt like a woman I didn't like. But it made palpable for me, finally, the unabridgeable distance between us, and I understood, as I hand't understood before, the real emotional necessity for the divorce. I let him think I was nobler, more generous and forgiving than I was, because the alternative was to tell him how little it all mattered."

I wanted you to be there with me, so badly, bare and twisted up with me... moving your calloused hands across my soft hip bones, pushing my shirt up my side. I wanted to burrow my head into the bends between your shoulder and jawline, breathing you in, watching your hair move. I wanted to press my mouth to your skin gently, raise my chin, and feel your smoothness against my cheek. I wanted to take the palm of my hand and twist it around to your other cheek, moving your face, slowly, towards mine. Our lips would touch, but we would not be kissing, our mouths neither closed nor open. Our noses would rub, I'd smile, your breath would smell so sweet. Your cheeks would flush, your eyelashes would flutter nervously, I'd move my hand into yours reassuringly. So warm, safe, home. My lips would make the formation and we'd press together, one hand in the small of my back, your other hand squeezing mine. I'd be breathless. 

Last night I dreamt of all the ways I wanted to kiss you."

And then, of course, there is the overshadowing knowledge that there really isn't any possibility to work with to begin with. 

My 24 hour spectacular date is being filed away in the 24 hour spectacular date category and being left alone. It was great, but taking it further would mean compromising things that are really important to me. I'm fairly versatile, but both the recognition of my religion and my need for intellectual stimulation are necessary if I am to start a relationship.

I had a good week, and an even better weekend, so far, despite the snow semi-killing Friday night. Seeing Bdaze and Langer always puts me in a great mood. Also got to hang out with Katie (roommate), Tyree, and Amanda (whom I haven't seen since high school). Got to eat amazing ice cream at one of my favorite diners with one of my favorite people. Laughed a lot, smiled a lot. Saw 300 AGAIN, and it was twice as good the second time.

I think of his new girlfriend, and I just want to hate her because I am so jealous, and I think of him, and I can't forget anything about our relationship and just relive it in my head. What the fuck happened? It was so good. I can't convince myself that it really was over, that he doesn't still love me, that we couldn't have made it work. Will I ever love like that again? Everyone says that, and everyone finds someone else sooner or later and loves them and claims it better, but I can't imagine myself loving anyone like I love him. I can't imagine anything better as good as it was before he stopped loving me. 

And I just torture myself with thoughts like: Does he love her like he never loved me?

"event","One wonders just how vast and gratuitous a catastrophe would have to be to shake the world's faith. The holocaust did not do it. Neither did hte genocide in Rwanda, even with machete-wielding priests among the perpetrators. Five hundred million people died of smallpox in the twentieth century, many of them infants. God's ways are, indeed, inscrutable. It seems that any fact, no matter how infelicitous can be rendered compatible with religious faith. 

Of course, people of all faiths regularly assure one another that God is not responsible for human suffering. But how else can we understand the claim that God is both omniscient and omnipotent? This is the age-old problem of theodicy, of course, and we should consider it solved. If God exists, either He can do nothing to stop the most egregious calamaties, or He does not care to. God, therefore, is either impotent or evil. You may now be tempted to execute the following pirouette: <i> God cannot be judged by human standards of morality.</i> But we have seen that human standards of morality are precisely what you use to establish God's goodness in the first place. And any God who could conern Himself with something as trivial as gay marriage, or the name by which He is addressed in prayer, is not as inscrutable as all that.

There is another possibility, of course, and it is both the most reasonable and least odious: the biblical God is a fiction, like Zeus or thousands of other dead gods whom most sane human beings now ignore. Can you prove that Zeus does not exist? Of course not. And yet, just imagine if we lived in a society where people spent billions of dollars of their personal income each year propitiating the gods of Mount Olympus, where the government spent billions more in tax dollars to support institutions devoted to these gods, where untold billions more in tax subsidies were given to pagan temples, where elected officials did their best to impede medical research out of deferense to the Iliad and The Odyssey, and where every debate about public policy was subverted to the whims of ancient authors who wrote well, but didn't know enough about the nature of reality to keep their excrement out of their food. This would be a horrific misappropriation of our material, moral, and intellectual resources. And yet that is exactly the society we are living in. This is the woefully irrational world that you and your fellow Christians are working so tirelessly to create.

It is terrible that we all die and lose everything we love; it is doubly terrible that so many human beings suffer needlessly while alive. That so much of this suffering can be directly attributed to religion-- to religious hatreds, religious wars, religious taboos, and religious diversions of scarce resources-- is what makes the honest criticism of religious faith a moral and intellectual necessity. Unfortunately, expressing such criticisms places the nonbeliever at the margins of society. By merely being in touch with reality, he appears shamefully out of touch with the fantasy life of his neighbors.

"event","I am self-absorbed in airplanes and takeoffs, in runaways and letdowns, in rekindling and hope. I spoke to you so early, from a worn out seat in the Southwest gate... I wondered how many had sat there before me, and I felt like clockwork. The passengers had departed, but they left remains as proof of their existance: a sticky smudge overlooking the wing; a fragile wrapper tilting this way and that on netted fabric; a bend in the page of my newly acquired magazine. I spoke to you. You exhaled quietly, still stuck in the gate of a dream. It was so early-- but when you softly asked if I was excited, I never loved you more.







I have changed so much-
I yearn for the unfamiliar taste of tea
and ache
for the warmth of a hand
to touch me

I am not proud of the things I subject myself to
though I am here,
and I will bloom an ugly flower,
seeds small, stock short, petals few

I am this map on the wall
stretched far and thin,
distorted,
unexplored,
unsure of even places 
that I know I have been

I am this cold room with cold floors
and I am not proud of the way I speak down to you
I am this lightbulb gone out
I am this sweater worn through

I am keeping this journal to remind myself
of the way
you made me
feel"

"event","Tonight I wrote seven papers for my ridiculous class that I'm taking (yeah, the one where the teacher had throat surgery so that he CAN'T SPEAK. he puts on a movie for three hours, then assigns shit). I think if I take another winterim class, it will be an online class, because I don't have the patience for three hours of movies every single day, sitting in the same seat, in a classroom that is incredibly hot (with no windows that open). To make matters worse, the class takes place from 11-1:40, so, I'm basically starving the entire time.

However, I found a way around classroom suckage. I brought my laptop in today to ""take notes on""... which ended up equating to me sitting in the back corner of the room, browsing apple.com and ebay.

Oh yeah, that brings me to my next topic of discussion. I bought a 60GB Video Ipod. Don't judge. I know I've always hated ipods because of their ridiculous battery replacement crap, but I did a bunch of research and paid extra so that I'm OK with it. I got the iPod refurbished off of apple.com, so yes, it was returned from someone else, but they repaired it and replaced it so that it looks brand new. It's covered by the same limited warrenty that brand new ipods are, and it only cost me $229 because of it's refurbished state (that's only $30 more than the 4GB nano....)

I also bought the two year extended warrenty for $50, so now I can bypass all the battery bullshit. The extended warrenty covers any battery depletion or failure, and I figured it was worth it, since under the apple battery replacement program they have now, you have to pay $60 for a replacement battery 90% of the time anyway. So, I could either pay $50 for TWO YEARS of full repair promised to me, or go with the flimsy coverage they give you for ""free"" that requires you to pay $60 to replace the battery. Hmmm. Yeah.

I also got overnight shipping, so it's coming in tomorrow. I'm tremendously excited. Truth be told, I HAVE an mp3 player, but it has a very annoying interface, and it's from Europe so it doesn't plug into out outlets (requiring me to carry around a fairly bulky converter thing). I also wanted a new mp3 player that was catered to by the industry that apple has created for iPods... the itunes store, podcasts (I still don't really get this part, but it looks really interesting), TV shows, etc. 

I bought some audio books to throw on this baby, and will probably subscribe to a couple podcasts, too. All in all, I'm pretty excited about it. How could I afford it, you ask? I sold my old desktop computer, FINALLY. I've had about 10 people who have been ""interested"" since I've upgraded, but I was tired of waiting around, so when I got an offer for someone to take it off of me for $250 total, I obliged. It's kind of a rip off since they're all new parts, but hey, right now it's sitting at home in my bedroom not being used, and has been in that state for almost six months. It's about time. So that money is going to my fabulous iPod!

I'm probably also going to sell my Nintendo ds lite, practically brand new, because I just don't have time to play it. If anyone is interested, let me know.

Tomorrow I have class, then my iPod comes in. I have no idea what's going on that night, but Saturday morning I have work until sixish, then Bryan is coming up for the night (or I'm going to his BRAND NEW APARTMENT!!). We're going to figure things out tomorrow, but I'm really excited. We've been talking a lot more lately and trying to figure things out. No matter what we end up doing this weekend, it's been pretty fun sending copeland lyrics back and forth. :)

I have a date set for my move to D.C., finally, too. I'm going on vacation to Williamsburg to explore colonial battlefields in the Revolutionary war for a week (May 27-June 2), and on June 2, I will be remaining down there to live for the summer and attend college in D.C. in the fall. Exciting. This is if, of course, everything goes according to plan.

Can I just say how much I love history? I am so pleased that it's my major. I've decided that in grad school, I'll probably specialize in early colonial american history, or just american history in general. For anyone who doesn't know, I'm a history major with a philosophy minor. Worth every penny, if you ask me.

"event","Wow, so I was just re-reading some entries in my journal and it occured to me that pretty much any entry I have made in the last month has been either directly or indirectly related to Matt treating me like crap, and me feeling like crap because of it. It is very confusing to me how I can dwell upon something that I don't want anymore at all; Matt was pretty horrible to me, in fact, and I wouldn't date him again given the chance. Now, that understood, all I have to do is realize that I have made good decisions regarding that relationship, and that options are only to continue being miserable about something for NO reason, or be happy. I choose to be happy.

Of course, it IS getting better. I think about the way our relationship was three years ago, maybe, once every couple of days. Then, I'll call him, he'll answer, and I'll immediatly realize it was a poor idea, so I'll say I can't talk for some random reason, and hang up, leaving him confused. I think I can fine-tune that plan so that I'm not calling him in the first place. :) At least we aren't communicating anymore beyond that 10 second confusing interaction.

I am ready to meet someone new-- actually, I've been ready for a while now. James once pointed out that it's basically as if I've been single for a year, and that's true. My biggest problem with relationships is that I feel if I have a 'fling' and take a chance, I will freak out and leave the relationship. I think that's the only possibility right now, since I don't forsee a serious relationship in my future at all anytime soon. Will something casual and fun freak me out? Will I worry that it will become too serious/that he will hurt me? Maybe I just need some good old sex, no strings attached.

Either way, Christmas is fucking lonely when you are seeing all these couples walking around. I wanted to be exchanging gifts with someone, pampering someone, cooking for someone, kissing someone, playing around in the snow with someone, decorating trees with someone, going to christmas parties with someone.

In a nutshell: I am pretty tired of the single life I have essentially had for a year now, where anything I attempt to enter is thrown in my face and abused. I want to have a REAL relationship with someone-- friendship, love, whatever-- where I feel enlightened when we speak. I want to learn from someone, appreciate/be appreciated.

I think my new years resolution will be to find someone (friend/more than friend) who can fill a new role for me-- that can teach me things, want to hear me speak, share interests with me, and understand me. It's time for some new faces."

"event","As if my deathly fear of cannibalism wasn't enough free-standing, I had to go and take philosophy classes where the book review reads as such:

""Topics covered in the book include cannibalism, burial practices, worshipping the dead, exorcism and getting rid of dead spirits, sacrificial killings, beliefs in the afterlife, and vampires. The author attempts to explore these topics for a variety of cultures and geographies, and does a good job of including examples from Islam, the West, Native Americans, Australian aborigines, and some other groups, but the book is in no way comprehensive. Several notable examples of man's obsession with death are excluded, such as Mexico's Day of the Dead, Halloween, and the raising of Lazarus by Jesus. Instead, the book tries to cover the topics we do not necessarily think about or are even aware of. These include the prevalence of ritualistic cannibalism throughout the world, the long history of sacrificial killings, and the one topic still alive today, the treatment of widows in certain non-Western cultures."""

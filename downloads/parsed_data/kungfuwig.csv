"event","so i was really tired today cause i was up till like four.  I woke up at like 1130 and had to go to baseball in fishkill.  We won our game 16-1, it was cold out.  We had another practice with my hardcore band yesterday, it was really fun.  Wow i am super tired, i am crying i am soo tired.  I have a super boring life and it sucks.  i am lonely and not really in a good mood."

"event","well today was quite a good day.  All day was really really good for some reason.  Then I had band practice with my hardcore band Thenados.  This band is me, scott, dean, andrew glenn and we are getting another guitarist soon.  It was really fun though, we have four songs now and they are all sick.  Hopefully we are going to play at Ryan Lafaros party on this sat.  I am in a really good mood today, i wish that i could be in a mood like this every single day."

"event","I've been very creative lately, and it feels so good. Three sewing projects have been completed just this week. Next is a scroll saw project, I just finished the stencil during lunch, I hope to work on it this weekend. Since I'll be cutting metal I might practice on a piece of scrap wood first, not sure yet. 

Note to self: Need to buy a new drill and bits, I love an excuse to buy more power tools."

"event","I finally have my own personal cell phone. It may not be the most expensive with all the latest and greatest technology but it works for me. (Motorola V550)

I always hated using my company cell phone, since I'm a manager I try to set an example. More then once I have needed to get after my guys for their cell phone usage and threaten disabling the phone portion. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against Wives, girl friends, and family just the amount that they call and the length of time they talk. Once or twice a day for a minute or two is fine but using it when off company time for more then emergencies is not cool. I know that in the past and even recently I have been guilty of this but since I'm a manager I have been given certain perks ie my company has told me that they don't look at may cell phone bill but I feel this don't give me the right to hold myself to a different standard. I feel that no one, not even myself, is ""Entitled"" to abusing the privilages that the company has given me."

"event","Tonight will be the first time since my surgery that I will be on a horse. I laugh because I hadn't realized that I had developed some fear during these last few months until I had an opportunity to ride this weekend and decided to clean the house.... So my trainer is coming over tonight to work my babies and just be there. I'm sure that I'll be fine. The fear that I feel is getting hurt with no one around. It's not likely that a horse can dial 911."

Maybe it is the independence that I now have, since I bought a economy car so I don't have to drive my big '71 pickup. I started a new painting last night, the first one in 9 years, it feels good to be creative again."

Unfortunately, I was unable to truly enjoy the time that I sent in the field yesterday, though it allowed me to work my mind. Now that I've calmed down for the pressure and stress I am able to really look at the situation and appreciate the help that I did receive when my eyes were crossing last night. Thanks  Paul... also Thanks for the rant on Dell USB port design I needed a good laugh at that moment."

Quickie: Do a handstand! Changing your perspective gives you a surprising solution to an old problem. 

Overview: This looks like a lovely day -- startling and surprising, but lovely nonetheless. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to keep your legendary calm, no matter what the stars or other mere mortals toss your way. 
  
Daily extended 
Your earthy nature makes you a big fan of routine and regularity. Unfortunately, you won't be able to count on that -- or anything else, for that matter -- right around now. The heavens have arranged for quite an amazing buffet of impulsive energies to wreak havoc on anything even remotely resembling a schedule. Your best bet is to talk yourself into appreciating the finer points of spontaneity right away, and to force yourself to have a good giggle in the process."

"event","That was amazing, I was able to follow a group of deer for about a quarter of a mile. My walk was full of contrasts from the bright green of the grass with flowers of blues, purples, and pinks poking through against the trunks of trees that were burnt and that shined a deep black. Life and death all sitting there in front of me while the sun warmed my face and the wind chilled my nose."

It's been a real long time since I have had the oporitunity to do this so it may just end up being a nice walk in the hills.  Hey, if everything feels right I might start a painting tonight :) Oh well, first I need to get my feet out the door."

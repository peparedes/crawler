In spite of driving around the neighborhood and asking everyone in sight if they had seen a very friendly, slight unintelligent husky/shepherd mix, we could not find him. The family was devastated. We called the local animal league where he is registered and, sure enough, some one had found Doc and called them. The animal shelter gave the person our phone number. The problem is they gave the wrong number!&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, many stressful hours and calls later, they called and we were reunited with Doc.

It was a complete rehash of <em>Bending the Willow</em> with some parts taken from <em>Bending the</em> <em>Willow</em> literally word for word. This book was published as a tribute to JB's struggle with Manic Depression in an attempt to raise awareness. An admirable wish. It shed no light on the topic and offered no insight. The only consolation is that funds are going to the MDF, although what percentage is unknown.<br /><br />The other thing that bothers me is why is JB's family so silent on his life, both the triumphs and the struggles? Were any of them at the book launch? People around the world applaud&nbsp;JB and yet,&nbsp;his family&nbsp;remains invisible. His son is a novelist, for goodness sake. I just wonder what their thought process is, that's all. Privacy is important to some more than others, but....<br /><br />It anyone has some insight, I would love to hear it.

It amazes me that children can sleep any where any time. If you look at the position little ones sleep in, you will see that they are completely undefended in nature, often open to the world. Somewhere along the way, we become closed off to the world, and begin to sleep in protective stances.<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/happy_lizard/pic/0000cb8a/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/happy_lizard/pic/0000cb8a/s320x240"" /></a><br />When he woke up, he told me he slept there because he wanted to be close to everyone but not be in the way. So he chose the middle of the living room under the coffee table. He probably figured if it was good enough for the dog, its good enough for him. They were inseparable until she passed away last year.<br /></div><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/happy_lizard/pic/0000bsdf/""></a>"

"event","I just finished reading Anna Massey's autobiography. As most of you know, she is JB's first wife and the mother of his son, David. The book was interesting and an easy read. Ms. Massey mentions JB several times throughout the book. I thought I would share some of what she tells us about him. (pp 230-231) <br />My apologies for the length :) <br /><br /><div class=""ljcut""><em>In 1993 my mother died and two years later Jeremy suffered a massive and fatal heart attack. He had been fighting ill health and mental battles for the last years of his life, but even so his death came as a shock to us all. I was telephoned early one morning, and went immediately to tell David in person. He was devoted to his father, and had been a wonderful support to him throughout his troubles. I often wished that I could have shared some of the burden with him, but I was the last person in the world who could take on that role. No son could have done more for their father than David did, and he was completely shattered by the news..... <br />....The funeral was a moving occasion, and all Jeremy's close friends came, and one realised what a loved person he was. People had found comfort and warmth in his ccompany, even though at times he behaved most strangely, for his manic depression was so severe that there were periods when he went completely out of control. But throughout all his troubles not one friend had deserted him. This must illustrate the magnetic qualities that he possessed. I shall never forget his insight, the way he had seen instantly that I needed to leave home in order to gain some independence all those years ago when we had just met. But all these uncanny perceptions were mixed with restlessness. He was so often driven, and inhabited a world of fantasy in order not to have to face his earthly demons. Until the last ten years of his life I had seen him at the odd family event, and we had always managed to remain on friendly terms, which we both felt was important for David, but in the later years, I found his delusions harder to accept and I stepped into the background. However when I married Uri, he had been genuinely delighted, and sent us the most beautiful bottles of bath essence from Penhaligon's, and insisted on giving us abox to see his quite brilliant performance of Sherlock Holmes at Wyndham's Theatre, with champagne served at the interval. That sums up Jeremy perfectly - generous, warm, larger than life and often quite crazy. A light went out in many people's lives when he died, for he was one of life's true originals. It took David a very long time to recover. His sense of loss was deep.<br /></em></div><br />A true original, indeed.<br />it is always interesting to read about JB from someone who knew him, both the good and the&nbsp;bad."

My husband walks through the room, glances at the TV and says, ""He (Holmes) looks really good in that jacket and hat"".... pauses,&nbsp; then says ""um, does that make me gay?""&nbsp; Now, I know he is kidding around and I know he does not think he is gay,&nbsp; but why are men so afraid to comment on other men's appearances?&nbsp; Why can't a man acknowledge another man's attractiveness with out feeling weird about&nbsp;it?&nbsp;
And what kind of message would that have sent my 13, 12 and 7 yr old if they were present?"

"event","Last night we were all watching TV in the living room when, out of the corner of&nbsp; my eye, I saw this&nbsp;GINORMOUS spider scurry across the hallway into the kitchen. I shreiked and dragged my husband into the kitchen to kill the creepy thing. This was no ordinary house spider.&nbsp;This got in from the outside and was the biggest&nbsp;spider I have ever seen. I am terrified of all spiders, much to the amusement of my 13 year old&nbsp;son, but even he was shaken by the size of this monster.&nbsp;
As we all crouched&nbsp;down to stare under the stove where the monster ran,&nbsp;it actually reared back on its hairy&nbsp;hind legs! That was it for me and I started spraying bug spray all over the place. Unfortunately, we never found it so here it lurks. I feel its eyes&nbsp; upon me&nbsp;as I type. My daughter has named it Gilbert and she&nbsp;won't go anywhere&nbsp;near the stove.&nbsp;
Where ever you are , Gilbert, please please please stay away from me.......

On a much happier note, we are going to see The Who tonight at Jones Beach! Two of my favorite things at once: the beach and a good rock concert."

The other day she was sitting at the kitchen table concentrating on a Soduku puzzle and I caught a&nbsp;fleeting glimpse of what she will look like as an adult. It must have been the way she brushed her hair over her shoulder, but she looked so mature and serious. For the briefest moment she looked like a business woman at work and then it was gone and she was a girl again. Hard to explain."

"event","It's early morning, kind of, and lately this seems tobe my favorite time of day. Being summer vacation the kids are sleeping later than usual and hubby is still asleep too. This is my time to have my coffee and sit quietly before the rush begins. I truly love my&nbsp;family and I am truly blessed but lately I feel like things are too crazy and I crave a few minutes&nbsp;peace.

What is the story with these crazy dreams? It seems every night&nbsp; the craziest dreams are played before my eyes as I sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;People I haven't talkded to asince childhood, places i haven't seen in years, all appearing in these dreams, some interacting with me , some not.&nbsp; There is this lovely old house with a wraparound porch and many split levels. Stairs in every room leading to different&nbsp;parts of the house, all on different levels. &nbsp;We are living in it and all is happy, but then I open a door and discover a room I never knew existed. Usually, the room is completely furnished but needs cleaning or there is someone there that I&nbsp;recognize but didn't know they were there.&nbsp;

Clearly, this is some sort of reflection of my real life. Maybe I am looking to&nbsp; reconnect with past friends. The newly discovered rooms may mean I want to try new things. The next time I am in Barnes and Noble, I'll check out a book on dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

I am not sure really why I feel the need to create this journal, but it is something I've been thinking about doing for a long time. Perhaps, it's because I'm feeling like I need something that is just mine, not shared with my kids, my husband or my family/friends.

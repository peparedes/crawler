"event","<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 12pt;"">Annoyed, angry, short tempered.&nbsp; Almost teenage like.&nbsp; I've found myself not on edge, just annoyed and with little tolerance to taking anyone's shit, especially my craptacular patients.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I've gotten a few patients which have been spectacular and I've taken extra effort to go out of my way to help them and their families.&nbsp; Especially 1 in particular.&nbsp; He has non-surgical pancreatic cancer, and has had it for 9 months.&nbsp; That in and of itself is a rarity, but it's obvious that his family cares about him and despite my extremely blunt assessment of his situation to him, his daughter, and his son-in-law that he probably doesn't have very long, they've still been great.&nbsp; I especially like his daughter, it's obvious that she cares and she's almost always at the hospital.&nbsp; I managed to talk them into allowing the palliative care people come in and talk with them to help her get some help with caring for her father and this will allow them to get into hospice much easier.&nbsp; It just dawned on me that they remind me of my Uncle, aunt and cousin.&nbsp; my uncle passed away in August from pharyngeal cancer, and all sorts of bad stuff keeps happing to them.&nbsp; Like my cousin and aunt, these people have been through hell, her sister/his other daughter passed away just before he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.&nbsp; I'm actually empathizing with them. ha. i thought I just liked them since unlike my other sad cases they seem to care.&nbsp; I had a uterine cancer pt with mets all over the damn place dying over the weekend, hell, she was dying on the Thursday and we called the family in at 0600, they got their fat lazy asses there at 1100.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> My attending and I sat in the room while this woman had Cheny-stokes respirations. She was dying and the only people there were someone who barely knew her and me who could barely pronounce her name properly.&nbsp; Where the fuck was her family?&nbsp; I hope they die alone and in as much pain as she was secondary to some cunt of a kid's refusal to allow hospice or to bother show up and visit for more than an hour. <br /> <br /></p><blockquote> In the past week I've actually stated out loud the following:<o:p></o:p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I actually told a patient today that he's going to fucking kill himself if he keeps using cocaine.&nbsp; (along with my other condescension which I've mentioned on the other site which shall not be na)<br /> I told a secretary to hush and to not interrupt me again, that when I say stat, I mean stat, so put that other chart down and input my damn orders because I've got a patient who's a hairs breath away from going to the unit. <br /> I told the laboratory that their protocols are going to fucking kill someone and asked them who they thought they were cancelling my orders.<o:p></o:p></p></blockquote>    <p class=""MsoNormal""><br /> <br /> In some ways it's liberating to say what I feel, but at the same time, it doesn't always feel like me.&nbsp; I'm hitting that 5 month internship wall, and it's starting to hit hard.&nbsp; I have to maintain my pace for at least 3 more months, then I can burn out.&nbsp; I will not slow down until I complete my elective in the MICU with the Pulm-cc elective.</p>"

"event","So M and I drove up to Lake E and spent the night ""camping"".&nbsp; It was extremely nice to get out of the house and do something which isn't house or residency related.&nbsp; I kinda needed a break from things.&nbsp; But I gotta tell y a, I'd barely call the place we stayed ""camping"".&nbsp; it's basically a mobile home trailer park with camper trailers which haven't been moved in decades and a few spots to pitch a tent.&nbsp; I'm going to have to take M out for some real camping without any amenities and a trowel to bury your waste.&nbsp;

"event","So after much prodding my Program director pushed through the approval for my elective through my program, and I received word 2 days ago that the program I want to rotate at approved my rotation.&nbsp; Now I'm a little nervous.&nbsp; I am intelligent, but I've never been in a ""center of excellence"" before and hope I can maintain the same level of competence that they expect there.&nbsp; Clinically, I have little doubt that my skills are any different, but I'm worried that my base knowledge and diagnostic skills may be a little.......lacking.&nbsp;

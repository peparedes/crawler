"event","While doing some leisure reading on Atheism on Wikipedia, I ran across this bit of trivia:

""In August 1987 an accredited reporter for American Atheist News Journal, Robert I. Sherman, attended a campaign dinner for George HW Bush. (Sherman's seven year-old son was ""brutalized"" at school for refusing to pledge to a ""nation under God."") Sherman asked Bush what he would do to appeal to the Americans who are Atheists? To which Bush, in part, replied "" I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens."" ""

"event","""Recently large demonstrations have taken place across the country protesting the fact that Congress is finally addressing the issue of illegal immigration. Certain people are angry that the US might protect its own borders, might make it harder to sneak into this country and, once here, to stay indefinitely. Let me see if I correctly understand the thinking behind these protests.
 
Let's say I break into your house. Let's say that when you discover me in your house, you insist that I leave. But I say, ""I've made all the beds and washed the dishes and did the laundry and swept the floors; I've done all the things you don't like to do. I'm hard-working and honest (except for when I broke into your house).
 
According to the protesters, not only must you let me stay, you must add me to your family's insurance plan, educate my kids, and provide other benefits to me and to my family (my husband will do your yard work because he too is hard-working and honest, except for that breaking in part). If you try to call the police or force me out, I will call my friends who will picket your house carrying signs that proclaim my right to be there.
 
It's only fair, after all, because you have a nicer house than I do, and I'm just trying to better myself. I'm hard-working and honest, um, except for well, you know.
 
And what a deal it is for me!! I live in your house, contributing only a fraction of the cost of my keep, and there is nothing you can do about it without being accused of selfishness, prejudice and being an anti-housebreaker. Oh yeah, and I want you to learn my language so you can communicate with me"""

But regardless, I'm incredibly excited and I can't wait to get started. I made candy bags for each of my residents to say Hi and Welcome to OU. Most of my residents are freshmen.

"event","He broke up with me. He's not ready for a relationship right now. It bums me out because I was beginning to have feelings for him, but I'm going to respect his wishes and just be his friend for now. He still wants to take me out on dates every now and then, he just doesn't want to be ""tied down"", he's got a lot on his plate right now. I understand that. As much as it hurts me, I'm going to respect his wishes and let him have some time and just be there for him. It doesn't mean that those feelings are going to disappear, but I'll be a good friend and be there for him to talk to. Best case scenario is that we get to know each other better and eventually he decides how fucking amazing I am and how much he wants to be with me and that he's ready. But I'll be patient until that time because I don't want him to do something he's not ready for. I would hate it if someone did that to me, so I'm not about to do it to someone else. I care about the guy, so I'm just going to be here for a listening ear and a smiling face, as a friend. I'm perfectly happy with that for the time being. I'll be the sweet, considerate, flexible, understanding girl I am and give him his time to sort things out and decide if he really wants me as a girlfriend or not. And I'll even do it with a smile on my face."

So I was driving all night, with the help of my friend Cam who needed a lift to Columbus so he could take a bus from there to Memphis. I was happy to oblige, because it gave me gas money and someone to switch off with so we could continue driving and not have to make ""sleep stops"". 

Today Devin is taking me to King's Island. I'm really excited about it. He's really good to me, I'm grateful to have him. Yeah, the relationship is just now getting off it's feet, but it's still a good one and I'm going to gush about it because I feel good about this one. 

God it feels good to be able to have my own time on the computer now. No longer rushed. No longer having people looking over my shoulder, checking their watches and tapping their toes, while they look at my screen impatiently waiting for me to finish what I'm doing online. 

Ahh, sweet sweet Ohio how I missed thee. Really. I did. New Jersey has so many faults. but I won't go into detail now. No need. Plus I have 15 minutes until Devin gets here to pick me up."

I miss everyone a ton. I've spent a lot of time missing the guy I'm dating, as well, but he hasn't missed me at all, apparently, so I will be dealing with that shortly. Probably this weekend when I have some off time and can devote some of my time to properly dealing with the situation. I deserve to be missed. I deserve to be adored and appreciated. Call me conceited, but damn it, I am amazing and I need to be with a man who agrees with me. I deserve no less nor should I settle for anything but. 

I'm already beginning to talk about travel plans for the week after Thanksgiving. Just for a week to go visit my friend Richard. That would be ultra fun. He and I get along marvelously over the phone and he always makes me feel better when I'm feeling really shitty. Even when I was ultra sick with strep throat and when I was extremely down about the whole current-guy-I'm-dating dilemma, he made me laugh and laugh and laugh.

"event","Adolph died yesterday evening. Him passing was a little harder to take than when Jackie Boy died. I had Adolph longer, and I had more faith in him living a nice long life. I can't help but feel mildly responsible for his death. Last week I had a crisis where I had a swarm of bugs getting into my room, so I was killing them, anyway I could. My genius idea was to spray them with this air freshener spray I have. It worked, but I wouldn't be surprised if some landed on the water of my poor Adolph and poisoned him. I don't know if that's the cause or if it was just old age, but I still don't want to believe he's gone. He used to always watch me, whatever I was doing. He was a good fish. Now I only have Jesus. He's an absolutely amazing fish. He has survived so much shit, and I adore him for it. He's also the biggest, most full Betta I have seen in person. 

Todd was here Sunday afternoon through this morning. We had a really great time. Sunday we watched Eurotrip, then I took him uptown to get Goodfella's. Then we came back and watched A Clockwork Orange. I had to work Monday morning, so I woke up at the crack of dawn, he slept in, and I went to work for 2 hours. I came back and we hung out for a bit then headed towards Cincinnati to go to Jungle Jim's. First we went to Olive Garden for lunch, then went to Jungle Jim's. It was really great. I got some glass bottled sodas and British KitKat's (yes, they are very different from the ones we get here. Not in appearance but in taste) as well as a Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar (more British chocolate). Todd got some glass bottled Dr. Pepper (made with pure sugar cane!), a couple other sodas, and this Spanish beer. We drove back to Athens, decided to go uptown for dinner, then came back and watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and hung out. He woke up with me this morning when my alarm went off, and when I went to work he left to drive back home. It was really nice having him here. 

This weekend I'll be coming home to take advantage of my parent's empty house to study for finals in peace. I'll be going to Alex W.'s grad party on Friday, then on Saturday is the Gallery Hop with Todd. That's all I have planned, really, other than studying my head off. Then next week is finals week. I have nothing on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday except for work 8-10a every day Monday-Friday. So those days I will be relaxing a ton, getting my room packed up, and studying like crazy. Thursday I have an exam at 10a and one at 2:30p. Friday I have one at 2:50p, then that's it for me as far as finals are concerned. I'll spend the rest of the night packing up my room, getting ready for the move. Saturday morning I have a First Aid Basics course from 9a-Noon here in Athens. I need a First Aid Basics certification for camp this summer, so that's the reasoning. Mom & Dad will probably get down here sometime in the early afternoon to get all my stuff out of here, checked out of the room, and on our merry ways by the early evening most likely. I think I will miss this room. 

Wow. Long entry. I suppose I had a lot to talk about. Sadness, happiness, excitement, anticipation for things to come...a wealth of emotions."

"event","My Jackie Boy Died sometime in the morning of Monday, May 15, 2006. I am bummed, but I was not entirely surprised, because he was doomed from the start. He came from an under-par fish store and he was small and always had some kind of health concern, at least to me. I came home from my weekend in Columbus to see that both Jack & Jesus looked sickly. So I closed the window - to warm it up in here; Bettas hate the cold - and fed them all. Apparently Jackie Boy couldn't take it so he passed on in the night. Jesus is doing just fine. I swear I've saved him sooo many times. 

So now I'm left with my original two boys, Jesus & Adolph. I love those two sooo much. They are really great Bettas. Jesus builds the best bubble nests and Adolph loves to watch me. 

I feel like absolute shit right now. Yesterday I woke up with a sore throat. Not sore in the sense that it hurt to talk or swallow. Sore in the raw sense. I tried drinking a lot of juice and water yesterday but nothing worked. I got a ton of sleep yesterday with naps, etc. I even made it to work yesterday. Today I've woken up several times throughout the night and my throat just keeps getting worse. Now it hurts to swallow and I still have that annoying raw feeling when I'm just sitting here doing nothing. I'll be calling off work this morning to go to the Health Center and get this shit checked out. As much as I hate taking meds to take care of my health problems, I might need to in this case. Blah.

I think it may have been caused by my trip to Columbus after spending 2 straight months in Athens with the fresh air. I was in Columbus for one weekend and I was breathing the heavily polluted air and I come back here where it's nice and clean and fresh and I get sick. Figures."

Plus I think I have more readers on this thing than on my xanga, and yes, I do enjoy a crowd.

Yesterday was a realllllllllllllllllllly good day for releasing some stress, some tension, and moving on from some unpleasant things. I won't go into detail because most of you reading this don't want to know that I got laid......wait.......oops.
Before that happened, though, I got a very nice back massage and that was.....awesome.

No, don't worry, I'm not falling into a relationship with this guy..it was just kind of a friend helping out a friend sort of thing. We had fun, I have no regrets :)

I've done some thinking the past couple of weeks. Taken some time for self-reflection on what I really want right now. Honestly, I just wanna fool around and have fun for a while. I have NEVER dated around, and right now is the perfect time for me to do so. I can get into a serious relationship at a later time, when it's more suited for me. But right now I need to take some time for myself, allow myself to have fun and explore. Dating around will help me clarify a bit more of what I'm looking for in a man. Opposed to what I thought 6 months ago, this method will allow me to avoid heart break. Right now I just can't take it again. My last heart break was way too major for me to be able to handle very well. The man who took my virginity broke up with me in a really terrible way. But I don't wanna talk about it, except that I have no regrets with that relationship. I do not regret giving up my virginity .....it was good LOL!

So to sum up, I'm just going to date around right now, maybe ......MAYBE have a short-term relationship or two...but nothing serious. If I start dating a guy I see potential in, I'll put more of my interests towards him, of course, but I won't expect a serious relationship out of it. But if something comes from dating a guy, I'm open to it. Whatever, I know what I'm talking about, it's just hard to put into words. 

Yesterday was reallllly nice without the commitment/attachment. I just have to say that. I'm done now ;)"

"event","This morning I had a really wierd dream (while trying to wake up) that this really irritating guy (I have no clue who....seriously) kept calling me and it didn't go to my voicemail until after 17 rings (yes I counted). And everytime it rang I just let it ring and ring and I rolled over in bed and groaned about the aggravation. I'm sure it was one of those dreams that integrates real-world occurrances into them, like the ones where people think they're falling in midair when in actuality they're just falling off their beds. Strange. The brain is intensely interesting. 

So because of this dream I didn't wake up when my 3 (yes, 3) alarms went off. I woke up at 9.25a when the new girl who moved in next door to me (and her friend) turned the TV on loud and began talking really loud. So I'm a little pissed but a little grateful. I'm confused.

Wierd dream. ..............17 rings????????????"

"event","I had a job interview with Anthony Thomas on Tuesday at 4 PM. She basically knew she was going to hire me, even after only speaking to me over the phone. She said that I seemed like a friendly person who would be great for the job at the kiosk. I accepted the position and she showed me some of the basics of the job/kiosk. So I went to the Gahanna store to train on Wednesday, worked from 3-9:15, learned how to work the register as well as got an idea of what the stores carry, as far as merchandise, compared to what is sold at the kiosk. Then tonight I went to Polaris for my first official day of work at the kiosk. 
Oh


My


God

I am totally bringing a book the next time I work. There was a good 2 hours where I had a customer at least every 20 minutes. Then after that I had NO ONE!! I really like being a salesperson, though! It is a lot of fun talking to people. It was so boring most of the night, though, since most everyone would either walk by me like I was invisible or ask me directions to freaking Starbucks...
The whole time I would smile at them all, welcoming them to purchase chocolate from me, a girl who doesn't really like chocolate to begin with.

Tomorrow is my day off of both jobs. I will most likely wake up around 8:30 or 9, carry up all the Christmas decorations to the entry way, Colleen is coming over at Noon to watch ""I Heart Huckabees"", then she's leaving, I'm gunna talk to my Andy for a while, then start decorating the family room, then call Elaine and tell her to come over and we'll watch some movie. I miss Elaine a lot. I can't wait!!

Tomorrow is so busy!!

Well, this was yet another long update, but I guess it is so because I don't update too often. OH yeah..I have to do this for a friend..Hey Chris..here is your mention, so cheer up!

I have an extremely messy room, which is stressful in itself because I just don't feel like cleaning it. But I need to. But I don't want to. See, now my 2 personalities are showing. Productive Sarah vs. Lazy Sarah. 

Lazy Sarah was winning until this morning when mother yelled at me. I hate being yelled at. That gave Productive Sarah some motivation to shine through. So this morning I filled out app's to Hallmark and Anthony Thomas. I went to turn both of them in, and Anthony Thomas told me to call back in a week and Hallmark told me that they weren't hiring (even though they gave me an app???? what the fuck - way to waste my time, you bastards). I'm also going to look into working at the warehouse for Victoria Secret. My sister worked there while she was in college and she really loved the job, so I'm going to look into it. I'm thinking of classifying my job at Macy's as the secondary job because this week they gave me SHIT hours and it's...complete bullshit. I told them I am planning to go to England for school next year. They scheduled me 40 hours last week, which I really loved. Then my scheduling got switched to a new manager and she only scheduled me about 25 hours. god damn it. 

I don't have money. I don't have money to go out and do things any more. I knew I wouldn't have that ability when I came home, because I am saving for an amazing experience. But it's frustrating because I have friends here who want to spend time with me but I really don't have the money for it.

I'm also limiting my Christmas spending to $20 this year. Normally I spend well above $100. But I need to budget. I do have to spend like $20 on Nutcracker tickets for my niece Natalie (my sister and I (Natalie's Aunt's) are taking her to see The Nutcracker downtown a couple days before Christmas). But this is an exception and it will be worth it. Exposing my Natalie-chick to the arts is extremely important and I don't mind an occassional splurge for her. She's awesome I wish I could spend more time with her. But I don't have the money for it!! The drive down to my sister's house costs me too much by itself...


Oh how I wish I could just be numb to it all. I just want to fast-forward to the time that I am falling in love with my future husband, then fast-forward to my wedding day, then fast-forward to the days when I have kids. I hate being in college. You might say I am rushing things. No. I'm not. I just know what I want and it's extremely frustrating that I can't have it yet. 

Excuse my rant. I haven't been angry for a long time (I've learned to suppress my anger quite well). But sometimes everything builds up and I get frustrated for a day. I'll go to sleep tonight and be over it by tomorrow.

...

OK I just got a phone call from Anthony Thomas. The store here in Gahanna is already fully-staffed but the manager from that store forwarded my app to the district office and they called me just now to ask me about a job up at Polaris Mall. Yes, it is a good 1/2 hour drive but it would be easy work. I would sit at a kiosk and sell Anthony Thomas chocolates to people, restock shelves, and close shop at the end of the night, since I would work evenings. The pay isn't as good as I was hoping for but she said she would give me lots of hours. I have an interview tomorrow at 4 PM (after I'm done working at Macy's 7-2) so we will see how that goes. I'm still going to keep looking at The Limited because it would be warehouse work, meaning better pay. 

I'm going to drive over to The Limited now and inquire about open positions, since I can't reach them on the phone. Wish me luck."

SOUR PATCH KIDS!!!

Yum I love them. I also really like those sour candies that are Cherry Coke flavored. Those things are delicious. I wonder if I can order them online...stupid Gahanna not having any candy store. Oh wait. We do. But they don't carry the Cherry Coke gummies. It's the Anthony Thomas chocolate shop. They have Sour Patch Kids and assorted chocolates. Anthony Thomas is my favorite American chocolate. European chocolate is sooooooo much better.

I really don't like chocolate too much, honestly.

But I do like Anthony Thomas and European chocolate on occasion, which isn't too often. American chocolate spoiled my potentially female-ish desire for chocolate in general. Waxy shit, it is. 

OK the bumps are going away now.

I also needed to change the water in my fish bowls but I never got around to that either. I swear I'm determined to kill my boys (my fish) and make it so that no one can see the carpet in this room or be able to come in here without falling all over themselves. I know how to move about but no one else does. Jesus christ. This room will take a couple days to clean up. All of my mess from High School still piled up and stashed in all the corners, trash piles along the walls, folded clothes from past loads of laundry sit on the floor waiting to be hung, and my belongings from the dorm room still have yet to be unpacked. The crates and suitcase all of it is in are laying all over the floor. Even my bed is covered in shit. Mail, grocery bags, Macy's coupons, a couple of phones, job applications....

Man oh man. I'm an absolute wreck!"

No really I've been around I've just been exclusively posting on xanga. LJ doesn't always suit my needs. And most of the people I know are on xanga so that works. 

hehehe I will only post here when I have something OUTRAGEOUS to say and I can't say it on my xanga because someone would have a fucking cow about it. 

What's happened since I last updated?
Well

-I went to college and learned lots of new neato things.
-I discovered that I want to go to England for school next year
-Bob and I broke up
-I discovered that I'm better than pretty much everyone on my floor of my building

Oh yeah. And I'm an opinionated, outspoken bitch. I love it. It makes me unique. No one around here in Athens knows who they are or what their opinions really are or why they think certain ways. It makes me sick.

We sat in his driveway playing truth or more truth...and the last question he asked was...""what do you think will happen to us ..when you go off to college?"" I answered the question to the best of my ability but as I was driving away I really couldn't help but wonder what he thought about it. Hmm.

"event","I wish my Grandma Anne was closer so that I could chat with her more often. She's so silly, especially for her age. She was giving me words of wisdom: 1)Stay young, 2)Especially when you're wearing pants, don't sit down with eggs in your pockets, and 3) Don't bend over in a rose bed...they'll attack you. hahaha I loved the one about the eggs. Yes, that tidbit of wisdom came from her own personal experience. She has chickens and apparently put the eggs she was collecting in her pockets to carry them back up the hill to her house and then sat down somewhere along the line and had yummy crushed eggs all over her pants. HAHA! She's quite the 'green thumb', as well, seeing as her house is completely surrounded by a jungle of flowers.

The people who made it to my party (as I can remember, hopefully I don't forget anyone!..I'm writing this down for my own records; knowing my memory, I'll probably forget!):
Grandma & Grandpa Hedrick, Grandma Anne, Sandy (mom's best friend), Nanny & Bruce (sister & fiance), Debby, Phil, Natalie and Ethan (sister, husband & kids), Mr. & Mrs. Koob, Matt, Brandy, Bob, Chloe, Jory, Alex Weaver, Elaine, Mrs. Adams & Kristy & Kelsey, Josh Karn, Sara Crombie, Sara Miller, Ingrid, Mrs. Dowdy, Mr. Cebriak & family, Mr. & Mrs. Shellhammer & family, Mrs. Sheffer, Chris Jones, Cassie & Carrie Wetherill, April, Boz, and Mrs. Mustric & her 2 daughters (family I babysit on Tuesdays).
I think that's everyone. The most outrageous gift I got was from April. A gift certificate to Victoria Secret! How awesome! lol what to get...

My Grandma Anne was highly impressed with Bob. ""I think he's A-OK!"" was the 1st thing she said to me when I asked her. Good. I was hoping she would."

"event","Yes. I know my high school career is about to end. Yes. I know I'm about to move onto an entirely new, ""exciting"" chapter in my life. Yes. I know I need to make money to pay for it. Yes. I know I'm 18 now and therefore have a plethora of new responsibilities facing me. And yes. I know I'm not perfect, so I'm probably not going to live up to standards. My mom asked me tonight if I had any exams. I said yes, and she glared at me and told me she was dissapointed. I agreed with her. So that ticked her off (not that I agreed.......that I have exams.........................period.). Then she starts doing something and I'm cleaning the kitchen. I get frustrated because cups start falling on me because of my stupid dumbass sister and her feeling that it's necessary for her to bring her own mugs (yes, multiple) into our home when she moves in, nevermind the fact that we have a million anyway and she wouldn't need to worry about not having a fucking mug to drink from. So as I stop the cups from falling on me, I groan and say, ""ohhhhhh I can't wait until she moves out! So she'll take her stupid mugs with her and she'll stop putting things away wrong,"" (yes..I admit that I'm anal about how my kitchen is cleaned. It became my chore and I like the system I created to get it done and it frustrates me beyond belief when things aren't done...my way. Cleaning the kitchen is supposed to be a stress-relieving activity for me, not a stress-inducing),""I'm so excitedddd!"" At this point my mother shushes me and I ask her, ""why?"" 
""I'm counting something!"" *she starts counting again*
""Well, I'm talking to myself"" 
shouting, ""Talk quieter to yourself!""
I mutter, ""Ignore me like you normally do""
""Will you just be quiet? I'm trying to count this right now. Not everything is always about you!""
""I didn't say that""

She left the kitchen and then came back in, I was bent over putting a pan away and she had the fucking nerve to lightly slap my ass. I told her, sternly ""Don't""

GAH I cannot wait to get out of here. I know college is going to be annoying for me. My mom is going to bitch at me about finances and I'm going to get fed up and we'll end up fighting too much. I don't want to come home for summer. I don't want to come home for winter break. I don't want to come home. I don't want to. I want to get out of here. I want to go somewhere and even though I will get homesick, I want to ignore it and live my life, my way. I want to leave Gahanna and leave everything behind. I want to fuck it all. Fuck this house. This damned house that I've lived in for my entire 18 years of existance. I need change. Desperately. I need the ability to do things I want to do, with whomever I choose, whenever I choose. I need the ability to drop the ritual of letting mommy and daddy know where little Sarah's going and who she'll be with and where she's going, and when she'll be back. I hate it. I want to take my trip to California now, and when I get back in a month, I want to go directly to OU...sweet, sweet Athens. I want to go to California and not visit any relatives and just....be. Drive up to the top of Angela's Crest and watch the sunrise and then sit on the beach and watch it set. Swim in the ocean. Eat Western Bagel's. Eat fresh California produce. Dip steamed artichoke leaves in melted butter and scrap the edible part off. Have a frozen chocolate covered banana by the beach. 

I want my life to fast forward. Leave everything behind and start anew. Fresh....clean...slate. No parents around to restrict me.

I'm too worked up right now, I need to go sleep so I can get over this ""tiff"" I'm in right now."

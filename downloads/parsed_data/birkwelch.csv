"event","Yay!  Update frequency is on the rise.  It's all because I decided I was getting a bit too lazy and started up one of my perpetual to-do lists.  

I've got all the Japanese kana down now.  The new goal is to learn 5 kanji a day.  At that rate, by the end of the year, I should have only a moderately below ""normal"" reading ability... but I still probably won't know what stuff means.  It's kind of funny listening to songs and anime now... most of it still sounds like rhythmic gibberish, but some words stand out and trigger an ""ooh, for a word or two I knew what they were saying!"" reaction.  Talk about your cheap thrills. :)

Maybe it's just me, but Japanese music seems to be on average much more cheerful and life/love-affirming than American music.  And I have this urge to try karaoke now.  Even though I shudder at the thought of public performance.  Hmm... what am I turning into?

Started a new kind of ""diet"" today -- basically all the fruits and vegetables I can eat, and then a modest limit on other stuff.  I also decided bagged potato chips have to join the ranks of fallen foods that I never get to eat again.  I had some bad pig-out moments recently, and didn't really feel too good afterwords.  If I really need fried potatoes from now on, I can always make my own.  Probably much better for me that way, and it's a little harder to down a thousand calories without noticing.

Despite all the junk food I've been stuffing myself with recently, I still managed to run my fastest 5K ever last Sunday.  19:20.  Sadly, based on race prediction formulas, I still won't qualify for Boston with that.  I guess there's still room for improvement.  Eat better, lose weight, try to get tougher mentally, since I still walked for a bit in the middle of the run.  That definitely shouldn't happen in a 5K.  I can do better.  Starting by not starting out too fast... still trying to get my head around the proper speed to start out a short race at.  I get another chance in just under four weeks, when I'll be running the April Fools 5K -- I doubt I'll win it, like I did last year, but hopefully I can improve a bit.

Today, bread and a haircut occurred.  Not at the same time.  That'd be gross.  Oh, and laundry.  And shopping, and booking a hotel for a future vacation... actually, overall today rates pretty highly on the productivity scale for me.  In the future is the hassle of car registration, once I get the notice from the state, and finally getting my desk cleaned off and organized.  

Lastly, some questions I forgot to answer from 47,026 years ago.  But I'm not spreading the damn meme.

1. What do you consider the most important quality in a friend?  

There's some fluctuation in what's most important.  Generally, a positive outlook on some aspect of life.  I'm usually drawn to people who have something (almost anything) that they really enjoy.

2. If you could live anywhere in the world where would it be?

In a rough order that in no way reflects any kind of rational thinking in my mind -- New Zealand, Norway/Sweden, Canada, Ireland, Australia, Japan, Washington State, Antarctica, Maine, Switzerland. 

3. What's your favorite thing about running?

For me it helps both my mental and physical health -- the first partially because of the discipline required as well as being calming (most of the time -- dead sprints are stressful, but running within your ability is nice).  Uh, the physical health thing is obvious, right?

4. Pirate or ninja? And why?

Oh, ninja, by far.  Pirates are more fun, but ninjas have an aura of mystery and elegance.  And since I'm learning Japanese, I have a bias, of course.

5. What's your first choice for a pet other than a cat?

If not a cat, maybe something ferret-ish?  I'd get bored with a fish, annoyed by a dog, and wouldn't really see the point of something in the lizard or amphibian line, but a ferret or something about that size sounds interesting.   

That's all, folks."

"event","Mixed feelings about the election Tuesday -- I was cautiously hopeful after Obama won, but finding out proposition 8 passed in California sort of deflated my sails quite a bit.  Bah.  

In any case, this week I don't think I did much of note.  Well, other than voting and passing the 1000 mile landmark.  Halloween pretty much didn't happen, not that I expected it to, but mild disappointment ensued from me turning on my outdoor light for nothing.  

There's a mouse in my house.  Possibly more than one.  I spotted it late one night in my living room, and I'm pretty sure now it's hiding out in my kitchen somewhere.  I think I have to kill it.  The scrabbling noises late at night are annoying enough, but I don't know how long it will be before it gets into my food... if it hasn't already.  Not too happy about it though -- although I generally find it necessary for my mental health to defend my humble abode from tiny invaders, I don't like having to kill something for being in the wrong place... just because my apartment is more comfy than in the snowdrifts outside.

And that's another thing.  I'm not really ready for evidence of winter quite yet.  OK, I'm never that fond of winter, but I still say it's too early for 8 inches of snow.  It's not the cold (I don't even think my heater has turned on yet, although my thermostat is set to some ridiculously low temperature), it's the grey blahiness of winter.  And worrying if my car will start.  So far, so good, but there was a slightly nervous moment on Tuesday night when I wasn't sure if I'd be biking to work in the snow.  

Add to that several grocery shopping trips that turned disappointing due to stores being out of the things I was looking for, and it's kind of felt like I'm being swarmed by petty annoyances.  Oh, and I need to get some drain cleaner.  

About the only really happy things to happen this week were watching the end of Maison Ikkoku on Sunday and going out to dinner on Tuesday.  Oh well, take pleasure in small comforts... or is it take comfort in small pleasures?  Either way, those two things saved this week from being a total downer.  Hopefully I can turn things around this next week..."

"event","Apparently I feel that now the appropriate thing to stock up on in case of apocalypse is no longer frozen pizza, but yogurt.  Not that I still don't have many frozen pizzas, but lately I've purchased five quarts of vanilla yogurt, one quart of kefir, and twenty 6 oz. cups of Rachel's yogurt in assorted exotic flavors.  At least it's supposedly good for digestion, so as snack/meal foods go I can gleefully slurp my way through all of that with a minimum of guilt.  But before that happens, I'll probably stock up even more -- I think there's a cubic decimeter of space left somewhere in my fridge...

Running went quite well on Sunday -- I finished in 1:30:39.  OK, so I was hoping to be under 1:30, but considering it's a personal record and over twenty minutes faster than the last time I ran the same race, I can't complain too much.  It's also kind of amusing/pleasing to find that when I check the race results, I show up on the first page -- 19th out of 1200 runners.  And other than some minor post race knee pain and some tired moments going up hills, the whole thing felt good too.  And I get to relax now, running-wise -- no more races planned until next May.  

I've also taken about half a step towards learning Japanese -- the first program/audio book thingy I borrowed from the library seems doomed to be unimpressive for general learning, but I'll try to pick up what I can.  I need something that's less ""I'm a tourist visiting for a few days"" and more ""I wish to achieve a comprehensive understanding of a new language.""  I'll make another stab at requesting something from the library that's more suitable within a few days.  Meanwhile, I wish the word ""okonomiyaki"" would stop repeating itself over and over in my brain.

I think I should also make a conscious effort to increase my music library a bit.  You know, just because.  And I really need to get my ebay habit in check again, because it's incompatible with my lukewarm desire to save some money to put into the stock market while it's down.  Not that I don't think I still have a fair amount of time to do that in, but my money tree doesn't exactly put forth fruit that often.  Which for some reason makes me think of cross-breeding the apricot tree that popcorn was popping on with the money tree and seeing if that resulted in explosions propelling dimes and dollars at high velocity in all directions.  But, oh yeah, reality.

Some people might want to know stuff to get me for my birthday in a month.  All my worldly desires (uh, well, most of the ones I can think of) can be found <lj-cut text=""Here."">

In order of usefulness/covetousness (mostly) and updated as of 2/24/2009:

1. I haven't found any proof that such a thing exists, but thanks to Rosetta Stone, I'd really like a magnetic poetry type thing of Japanese kanji and kana characters.  
2. Wooden Spoons.  For stirring... uh... hot stuff.  Or stuff in hot pans.  Basically this comes from noticing tiny bits of melted and rehardened plastic in my hash browns one morning. 
3. Poetry or fiction books written in Japanese.  I was a little heartbroken when the one I had my eye on at the Thrift Store was sold before I got around to purchasing it.  Sure, it would have taken me years before I was able to read even a tiny fraction of it, but...
4. Due to near obsessive/compulsive listening to the soundtrack, I wouldn't mind owning any of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle on DVD, Except the double feature movie Princess in the Birdcage Kingdom.  But I'm picky about pricing and patient when it comes to DVDs, so no rush.
5. Maison Ikkoku box set DVDs, volumes 1,4,5,6, and 7.  Not sure how I feel about bootlegs (all-region DVDs), so for now I'm avoiding them.  Good sources for these are ebay or this web site (for some of the ones I'm missing): www.mjentertainment.net
6. T-mobile phone minute cards ($100 increments are the most economical, but whatever is good... although I should probably be considering switching to a contract.
7. A small houseplant, to replace the one I killed.  The empty pot I now have is roughly 4 inches in both diameter and height.  I enjoy having plants in the house, but I'm terrible at remembering to water, so something that's at least somewhat drought resistant would be good. 
8.  I could use more technical/running socks.  I tend to wear slightly thicker technical socks when I run, so proper running socks (which I think tend to be thin) may or may not be quite what I want, but I'll be happy with anything that helps keep me from having (more) blisters.

Frog Knows. I enjoy getting homemade stuff, random music CDs, recipes (preferably vegetarian), activity vouchers, or other creative ventures.  Don't blow a wad of cash on me if you've already got a great idea for something cool. 

9. A new CD burner for my computer.  Sadly, the ones from my old computer don't fit in the case I have.  Things this far down the list are pretty low priority.  I don't need anything fancy and used is fine... you should be able to find one for around $20.  It does have to have a normal, flat front, or I'll just have the same problem again.  Obviously an external drive would be fine too.
10. Traders & Barbarians -- the expansion for Settlers of Catan.  I don't have anybody to play it with right now, but I have a minor impulse to complete the set.
11. Chandrika soap.  I don't know why I can't just buy this for myself, but it feels like a luxury item I don't quite need.
12. A backscratcher.  A moment of whimsy says I need one of these.  I remember you used to be able to get them practically free at party shops or win them at fairs...  
13. One largish pillow, or possibly just a new pillow case.  Not for sleeping, for keeping me from hurting my neck/back while doing crunches.  Definitely a thrift store/DI item if you feel compelled to get this for me.
14. I'll never say no to more Rachel's yogurt.  Really.  :)  Well, as long as I have fridge space.  I'm sadly empty at the moment.
15. Running shoes/gift cards/gift certificates usable for running shoes.  The best deals I've found online at ebay and holabirdsports, but any running store will also do.  Currently I run in New Balance 857/858s and maybe 859s (I haven't tried them on yet, but they'll probably work) or Mizuno Wave Inspire 3 or 4 -- size 11.5 normal width for all.  But I have several backups at the moment, so not a priority. </lj-cut> 
      
That's about it -- today I'll be walking and running and maybe trying the new health food drive-thru (it sounds contradictory to me, but I'm willing to check it out) and doing minor shopping and just maybe folding my laundry.  I'm feeling quite cheerful today -- I wonder why?"

"event","I gets to see my sister before she becomes a Californian next week.  I'm thinking at least a minimal amount of corruption with board and card games and cookies should happen before she and Joe have to vanish into the abyss of new work and new apartment and such.  Thanks to one of the people I'm chatting with online, I've developed a huge craving for lemon bars, so I need to look up the recipe and produce some, along with regular egg-free cookies, before they arrive.  I'm also thinking watermelon... it's on sale at the stinky Mexican market and if they have a good one, I'm going to pick it up.  Maybe two.  Mmm, watermelon.

Running was hard on Sunday.  I mildly injured the top of my left foot, narrowly avoided massive blister trauma again, and got really bored running up and down the same street... well, I lost count, but something like 18 times.  The bad thing about running in the black of night is parks are closed, and pathways that are more interesting don't feel as safe.  But I had better get used to the idea, because 90-100 degree weather is here to stay for a while. 

Livejournal gets two points for their multiple versions of ""page not found.""  I should really get over being amused by AYB... it's so last century.  But I can't help myself.

My nightly reading is a bunch of tales by Lovecraft now.  I'm wondering if this will turn out badly... so far I keep falling asleep before anything interesting happens, but perhaps I'll eventually get to a place that could give me nightmares or keep me up, shivering in fear.  We'll see... maybe I'm sufficiently jaded that one of the supposedly greatest horror writers of all time will roll off my back like... that thing with a back that stuff rolls off of.  Oh yes, a duck.  Which also floats on water.  So if horror stories roll off my back, then I must be a duck, and therefore made of wood, and therefore, a WITCH!  I'll expect everyone reading this to contribute a faggot to my pyre.  

Still no job, same shit, different journal post, blah, blah, blah.  I hate being so predictable."

"event","I own lots of Settlers of Catan games... and there was much rejoicing.
My bathroom is clean... and there was much rejoicing.
Ants continue to invade my apartment... and there was much frustration.
I have a new recliner (sort of)... and there was much rejoicing.
I made a trip to the farmer's market and not only enjoyed visiting all the booths, but managed to purchase a bag of mushrooms and a live rosemary plant... and there was much rejoicing.
I realize now that I get frustrated when people describe all human nature as absolute... and there was much... meh-ing.
I seem to have found the best spot for my wireless internet (and there was much rejoicing), but it requires levitation or a chair, a chessboard, a box, and Killer Bunnies all stacked up... and there was mild annoyance.
I spent too much time yesterday clicking on butterflies while watching TV... and there was mild self-recrimination.
My shoulder is almost healed... and there was a mix of frustration and rejoicing.
Wall-E is coming out soon, and Avatar will finally restart... and there was much excitement.
I have lots of tasty peaches and nectarines... and there was much rejoicing.
My apartment remains surprisingly cool despite outdoor temperatures in the 90s... and there was much rejoicing.

So... overall, much rejoicing.  Also, there's a good chance I'll be able to renew my lease, based on indirect discussions with my landlord.  Which is good, because I continue to suck at seeking out, applying for, and getting a job.  Maybe I'm just trying to force myself back to school... and makes me wonder on the other hand if I'm just trying to make myself unhappy because I think I should be.  

In any case, I have a couple of scorching summer months at UPS to help motivate myself to change."

"event","Tired lately.  It's getting hot here, and the air quality is getting bad, but I'm still riding my bike nightly and enjoying it, as long as I don't leave too late and put pressure on myself to ride quickly.  But my car is ""fixed"" in that it started today and served to help me stock up on groceries I needed.  Not sure if it was broken at all, might have just been lack of gas, although I still think it's weird to have it run out immediately after getting home... more likely is a minor electrical problem that prevents it from starting on high humidity days.

I've had a couple of game nights with some friends from work, playing marathon sessions of Settlers of Catan and now Cities and Knights... it might become a weekly thing or a semi-weekly thing.  It's nice to have something social to do on weekends, at least.  

Meanwhile, at home nature has decreed that it's time to face a new ant invasion.  The good news is that they aren't in my kitchen or near my food.  The bad news is they don't seem to be susceptible to the ant traps I put out, and aside from normal ants I'm seeing a ton of the flying drones around, and they creep me out.  I don't know if I'll try more traps or spraying next.  I could seriously do without insects making a home in my home.

I hurt my shoulder last week, which has slowed down my training a bit, but I'm slowly recovering, and the 5K I ran on Saturday went OK despite a really hilly course -- I now own a first in age group tile as a prize.  I think I'll try to get up hella early on Sunday to run 22 miles, hopefully before the air gets thick enough to spread and hot enough to melt the flesh off my bones, because I'm against that.  

Must try to eat more vegetables.  And sleep more.  Or maybe less, I'm not sure, whichever will make me less tired and more productive."

"event","Sweet.  I love it when money arrives in the mail just in time to ""save"" me from my own folly and/or laziness.  In this case, I got reimbursed for my eye exam and glasses from the end of February, and got my dividend check within the space of a week, just after I received an email warning that my checking account had dropped below $100.  I had forgotten that I set up such a warning, but it's good to know that as long as I remember to walk the three blocks to the bank and actually deposit my checks, I don't have to put everything on my credit card... or even worse, transfer money back from savings.  Because that would make my brain 'splode.  

My car breaking down/not starting turns out to be the perfect motivation to ride my bike to work every night.  And now that I finally have the full complement of lights, helmet, chain and lock I can be slightly less paranoid about both killing myself and having my bike stolen.  Man, that would suck -- you've just been dealt a fatal blow by an oncoming car, and as your spirit is leaving your body you glance down and see the driver get out, shrug his shoulders, and proceed to load YOUR bike in HIS trunk.  

Anyhoo, it's a six mile trip, it takes me about half an hour, and so far the only down side is slight wobbliness when I get off my bike and the fact that with wind chill it's surprisingly cold at 2:30 am.  Must remember to stuff a jacket into my backpack tonight, yep yep yep.

Of course, sooner or later I should verify that my car is broken and maybe fix it in case I need it.  I'm just worried that doing so will be the temptation that causes me to stray from the path of righteousness (or at least the path of bike-riding).  I may just put off fixing it until my next vacation, which is in another week and a half.  You know, when I'm looking forward to my fourth week off in about three months, it kind of makes me love my job.  It's too bad I can't reschedule it for July, though, when Anami and Joe are coming to visit en route to California.

Must... figure... out... where... to... put... giant... boxes... of... crap.  Must... not... spend... day... reading... fantasy... novels.

"event","You know, I have this urge to create a picture of real war kittens and make a credit card out of it.  This despite the fact that I have no need for a second credit card.  I'm thinking 400-ft tall cybernetically enhanced Tokyo-trampling kittens with laser vision and adamantium claws and enough residual cuteness to cause passing fighter pilots to stop flying and go ""awwwww"" just before they hurtle into a mountain.  I tried googling for relevant pictures, but the results just weren't quite what I had hoped.  Another day, perhaps, when I learn Photoshop, and for that matter, own Photoshop.

I have a bike helmet now.  All I need is a lock and I can fulfill my lifelong dream of taking my bike to work.  OK, not really a lifelong dream, more of a thing I had hoped to be doing sometime during May.  If I splurge a little and buy some panniers, I could probably use my bike for shopping and eliminate 90% of my driving and probably improve my health as well.  Of course, with summer approaching and the air quality probably getting worse, I may be forced indoors more, although I hope it doesn't get too bad.  Jogging in my living room was boring enough, and I don't really want to buy a stationary bike, aside from that defeating the purpose of not having to drive.

I could stand to take a little time each day to sit and think or plan.  Come to think of it, maybe I should have a schedule.  I'm notoriously bad at holding to such things, but it would certainly help me spend less time watching bizarre Japanese game shows and sleeping.  Maybe.  

I'm having sort of an odd competition to see how long I can go without visiting an ATM, which is kind of stupid in a world where pretty much anything can be bought on credit, but I feel like I'm cheating somehow when I charge $2.12 on a card.  That and I still like to check out garage sales, and they don't take Discover.  It has been fun surviving by raiding my multitude of change stashes whenever I want a random trivial item.  However, it must end soon, as I have promised $10 to help the campaign of a coworker running for a city council position, and I just don't have that many quarters.

I've learned to let myself rest after running.  The staying on my feet all day to bake hurt.  That being said, experiments in kitchen are big fun, especially when you get to sample the results.

Someday... I'll be able to resist eating an entire frozen pizza after cooking one.

UPDATE: Getting my bike ready is now a priority, as my car won't start, again.  It's very random.  Oh, and I need to pick up my lights too, as I'll be riding at night for the next two days just to go to and from work."

"event","Arrgh, back to the grind.  

Probably the most exciting thing to happen this week was me picking up the paper, reading about a crazy lady in the local section, and realizing ""Hey, I know that person.""  It's strangely mind-boggling to know that the person who took off all her clothes and repeatedly rammed her car into someone else's car in the middle of the night used to live in the same house as I did.  It's like infamy by association -- I can have some of the reflected glory of being fucking nuts, without having to be arrested and taken to a mental institution myself. 

I can't believe June is almost here.  I kind of thought I would have been further along by now.  I guess for some reason the end of my lease is on my mind, even though it's still three months away... I'm really hoping I can continue living here.  Not just because I like it -- I'll have a hard time finding anything near this price if I have to go apartment shopping again.  And I hate that kind of shopping.  Car, house, really anything that's vastly expensive carries the uncomfortable risk of being really screwed over, and I have a hard time regulating my desire to trust people in light of the fact that a good many people will happily take advantage of 2-year old cancer-stricken war orphans if they think they can get away with it.  Eh, worry about it later.  

I'm going to bake a lot of cookies.  For some reason, it sounds like fun.  First, find the Tupperware needed, then choose some recipes... and I might get a book or two read while things are baking.  Which reminds me I have other projects to complete.  Pictures, music, writing... we'll see how much stays in my head and how much escapes into the real world to wreak its chaotic will upon the universe.

Sometime soon, when I'm bored, I plan on figuring out how many miles I've run so far this year and estimating how many I'll cover annually.  I'm guessing ~1200.  Which will cost me a small fortune in shoes.  Hmm, I wonder what the cheapest way to exercise is?  Almost every sport requires equipment and such, and I'm kind of curious if you average stuff over the life of said equipment, what comes out on top.  Maybe I'll visit the great wide internet later and try to find out.

Grocery ads are here... time to finish this up and start dreaming about food. ;)"

"event","OK, one exhausting and overly warm run later... Yay!  I won, so to speak.  I finished my marathon in 3:28:06 in 80+ degree weather, despite a rather long period during the run where I came to my senses and thought it might feel nice to walk the remaining 9 miles.  I mean, it really was a beautiful day to be in the particular canyon I was in, especially if one wasn't punishing one's body for the crime of not being equal to a completely artificial goal to be at a certain place by a certain time.  But after a few minutes I lost the shred of sanity I had temporarily obtained and decided I would go back to running, and somehow that was good enough to be under 3.5 hours.  

I felt like shit when I finished, but seven mini fruit smoothies later I only felt like puke, or maybe even watery phlegm.  Of course I'm going to do it again next year.  Depending on the temperature, I'll probably be aiming for 3:15 to 3:20.  And if that goes well, the year after will be the year I try to qualify for the Boston Marathon (3:10).  Of course, I could just keep running the same speed and in 15 years I can qualify with my current time... but I'm impatient. :)

Of course, four days later comes the storm I would have liked to run in.  But it's been nice for walking around, and just breathing in.  Also, I'm quite pleased with the ipod shuffle I bought for the run.  You know, because everyone should have an mp3 player that is light enough to clip to your scrotum* if you should happen to want to run naked, and has enough battery life to last for 12 hours if you can go that long running naked without being arrested.  

In other news, I've managed to finish a couple of books and get my apartment cleaned up a bit and watch a couple of movies and generally accomplish a lot of not quite productive things in my weeks off.  You know, I haven't thought about it for a while, but it's been a long time since I can recall being out-and-out depressed.  Not that things couldn't be better, but that's a good start.  

If I can't find or motivate myself to pursue a job, I'm reconsidering volunteer work of some kind, because I have too much free time, especially when I'm not working double shifts to make extra money I don't need.  Sometimes I think I need a bright neon tattoo on the back of my neck declaring me certifiably nuts.  Tattoos aside, I guess if I go that way I'll need something challenging enough to be interesting, but not so much that I make a mess of things.

*For those lacking a Y chromosome, you could clip a nipple.  No pain, no gain, or something like that.  Of course, if you're too much of a pansy to draw extra attention to your private parts while running naked, you could attach it to your lip, your earlobes, your hair, your pinky, or your armpit hair, or as a last resort, shove it up any available orifice.  Performance is not guaranteed in that last instance."

"event","Sometime soon, there will be cleaning of the toilet, before it comes to life and eats me.  What does that have to do with piracy?  I don't know, but if there was a pirate living in my toilet... I'm stopping that line of though before it goes anywhere.

It's nice to have a bit of vacation.  I can do spring cleaning, and spend time trying not to stress out too much about the marathon this weekend.  

It's weird that this run has become so important in my head, but when I think about it, I haven't worked so consistently on anything in a very long time.  It's kind of a testament to having good habits, which is nice to think about it considering all my bad habits, particularly relating to time management.  So I guess a lot is riding on a positive result time-wise, just because it will be the proof in my head that I can be consistent and that consistency pays off.  

I still need to spread that consistency to other areas of my life. 

I'm arguing with myself as to whether I should purchase an ipod shuffle.  I'd be using it just for running, and I think they're only about $50, which hardly breaks the bank, especially after the economic stimulating by the current president.  It's something I don't need, though -- my regular ipod is fine, just a little heavier.  Funny to think about something that only weighs about 5 ounces as being too heavy...  I'll probably resist, unless I spot one in a store somewhere and start drooling.

I have a bike now.  More correctly, my bike is now at home where I can use it, except that I don't have a helmet or a lock.  Finding/buying those two things may be the next step towards biking to work and maybe helping me lose the last 5-10 lbs. I half-heartedly told myself I'd dispose of before the end of June.

Money isn't an issue at all right now, but rising food prices are starting to annoy me.  It's that things take root in my head as being worth a certain amount, and once the price rises beyond that amount, I pretty much no longer think they're worth buying, even though with a little mental adjustment they are.  I guess I'll monitor my brain (sounds like I should stick in some electrodes) and have an intervention with myself if my diet gets either too boring or too unhealthy.  

Speaking of which, a burger is calling my name right now.  Life is good. :)"

Me: ""OK, Legs -- it's really time to do that standing thing, and maybe even the walking thing too, because lying like a rubbery sack of protoplasm all day isn't good for me.""
Legs: ""No, we really don't think so.  In fact, you can take your walking suggestion and shove it up your butt with a 4 foot pole.  Maybe that will help you balance while you walk on your hands, because that's the only way you're going to be mobile until we're good and ready.""

Extra naps aside, things are going pretty well.  Except for being boring.  And struggling with my insurance.  It turns out VSP, which I thought was just an acronym, is actually the company providing my vision insurance.  If I had known that 3 months ago, I could have saved myself a couple hundred in eye-related expenses.  

May is near.  I think I'd like a really good thunderstorm soon, not a shadowy pretense of a shower.  I should get out more, too -- maybe hit a bar, or a comedy show, or a church... commit a  burglary, go out cow-tipping, run naked through Sugarhouse Park until I get arrested... I'm just trying to toss out some ideas.  

Instead, I'll probably just work more.  At least I don't have to stress out in more than an idle way about <insert generic crappy-economy issue here> affecting me personally, even if it depresses/angers/annoys me that things are the way they are.  Except gas prices -- I still think those should be around $5-6 a gallon.

Don't know why that popped back into my head, probably something to do with the self-mandated overtime being almost over.  More time and energy to focus on harder thing, like job hunt.  After visiting a career fair last Saturday, I was left with a mild to medium feeling of inadequacy... general ""I'm not ready for this"" stuff brought on by not fulfilling any of the requirements for positions I'm interested in.  That's probably an exaggeration, but it feels that way to me.  I did pick up some good tips from the lecture on interviewing, and at least I can learn more about the two companies there relevant to my interests, even if the appearance is that I couldn't get a job at either one even if I sequentially fellatiated their entire board of directors and the HR departments to boot.  

In other news, there is a steady stream of ants traipsing to their doom in several places in my apartment.  Really, they sealed their fate when they swarmed my counter top for the three breadcrumbs I left out after breakfast yesterday.  I don't want to have to limit my usable kitchen space to the tiny area next to my stove, and while I try to keep the place clean, I don't think I should have to develop an OCD about scrubbing surfaces 5 seconds after I use them.

New running shoes are on their way here, hopefully in time for the race Saturday.  I'm really enjoying cooking rice and covering it with stir-fried veggies and Boca.  80 degrees Monday, it snowed yesterday, perhaps tomorrow will be a tornado?

Week gone by is a haze of work interspersed with a long run and a bit of illness -- I've been calling it a half of a cold, because usually when I get a cold I'm reduced to a nose-dripping misery, but this time, not so much.  Slightly less working ahead, but still more than usual.  Got formally rejected by UDOT, so no chance of any new job for me yet without extra work.  A little disheartened, but I was so underqualified that it would have been a miracle if they had given me the time of day.  So, more working on being workable for new work.  Still, with the economy drooping like it has been, I'm grateful that I have a job that's unloseable and the opportunity/flexibility to work part or full time as need strikes.

Meanwhile, I've declared war.  The ants storming into my pantry are out of control, and although I somehow feel guilty about it, I'm now out to kill the buggers instead of continuing a peaceful coexistence.  Coming home to find a hole chewed in the Ziploc bag containing my butter and a writhing black mass inside was among the more unsettling things to happen over the past few days, especially for an insectophobe/arachnophobe like me.  So, after reorganizing almost all of the food in my kitchen, the battle was begun by vacuuming a couple thousand of the suckers up, and will continue with the purchase and placement of ant traps later this afternoon.  Still, for some reason I have this little niggling feeling that attempting to end a million or so insectoid lives may negatively impact my karma.  But barring a mutual sit-down with a human to ant translator at a peace table, this is the way it has got to be.

Car costs $450ish... so far.  Finding this out led to mild depression for 8-12 hours.  Still need inspection to be done, pending bumper fixing, and that may lead to subsequent needed repairs.  Brain has compensated by going insane and ignoring all semblance of pretending at money management.  Later, I will probably atone for my spending sins in the usual fashion -- 20 hail $$$$'s and a couple of weeks of picking up extra shifts.  Unless I just rationalize it all under the heading of extra money the government is giving me instead of doing something responsible with it's own FUBARed budget.  Feels like cheating, but lately I've noticed work takes it's toll on my body, particularly my joints.

May run a 5K this Saturday.  Sort of startled to realize that I haven't done a real 5K race since high school.

Repelled an invasion of ants from my cupboard, via moving food items to the table, and ruthlessly vacuuming the SOBs up with my handy-dandy hand-vac.  They were after the crackers I keep as my perennial snack, which is normal ant behavior, I guess, but I wasn't expecting an assault so high off of what I think of as ground level.  Turns out ground level is basically at the bottom level of my cupboard, so all it takes is a few tiny cracks in the ground.  Next up is a reorganization of foodstuffs to prevent a recurrence of the invasion.  

As I was pulling into the driveway last night, I spotted a raccoon.  If it would have hung around a bit, I might have asked it a few questions, like what it's doing more or less smack dab in the middle of a major city.  It scampered off before the interrogation, however.  It also didn't lurk in the shadows to sneak up behind me and bite my ass in order to infect me with rabies/zombie virus/evil nanobots, despite whatever my imagination may have come up with as a reason for a roaming raccoon.  

Really, I hope today was the last time I see snow for a while.  I mean, come on, Winter!  Keep your frozen metaphorical dick inside your metaphorical pants and stop sticking it into the seasons I actually like.  Okay?  See you in 9 months, seriously.

Need new shoes.  Bah, the problem with having a budget that's more or less entirely imaginary is that reality keeps waving its seductive strawberry-scented tendrils in front of the money that you're not supposed to be spending, and when you try to be strong and turn away, there's an army of rationalizations waving truncheons and machine guns and telling you to just go peaceably and nobody gets hurt.  

Obviously, I need a metaphorical diet to go along with the real one I've sort of abandoned.  Anybody out there got extra willpower I can borrow at reasonable interest rates?"

I'm feeling a little pressure about running my next marathon now as a result... if I had cut another minute off my time and could run the same pace for twice as long, I would qualify for the Boston Marathon.  Not going to happen, but now the pressure's on inside my head to at least make a good show of things in May.  

I've completed one application, and will send my resume to a second company today.  I'm trying to keep expectations low, so if I get dutifully ignored in both cases, I won't feel too bad.  Sadly, those two applications are almost my entire collection of suitable jobs for someone with my experience.  Maybe it's back to grad school in the fall.

Finally managed a fix on what's wrong with my car, according to a code reader I borrowed -- the idle control system is malfunctioning.  Haven't gotten around to getting an estimate for fixing it yet, but I've also got registration to take care of, so my month can be all fun and exciting with the spending of the moneys for maintaining my means of transportation.  If I didn't need heavy steel-toed boots for work, I'd probably be running there and back again every night now that the weather is all nice and rosy.  

I plans to stock up on fake meat and kitchen utensils today before heading into work early so as I can afford to pay for the car crap.

If you count the negative balance I have on my credit card, I'm financially ready (by my own standards) to move out.  I'm going to try hard to resist the temptation to accept the first place in my price range with more than three walls and at least 62% of a roof.  Really, I can't think of what I should care about other than location and price.  And south facing windows, but I can do without.  I suppose I could actually look at houses too, I mean I have more than enough for a down payment and with the right financing I could make monthly payments without too much of a strain (OK, I'm probably kidding myself there).  Feels too much like commitment, though -- I'm not sure I want to stay in Utah for an extended period of time.  There's an opening for an idiot civil engineer like myself in L.A. that starts at around $50,000 a year, which I'll probably sign up for an interview for (deadline is the end of the month, if I recall correctly), but part of me says ""L.A.?  Ew.""  In short, the magic 8-ball in my head keeps coming up with ""outcome uncertain"" when looking at my future.  

Hmm, and now the mouse button works again.  What the hell?

There's a startlingly blue sky outside, so if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk to the library now."

"event","The hot and sour soup I made today turned out quite good.  With a few slight modifications, I think I can make it perfect, at least by my not so demanding standards.  Most impressive of all to me was the fact that it looked like what I think hot and sour soup is supposed to look like.  

It's kind of nifty to actually be accumulating money, even if it's only for a brief while so that I can afford to move out without living paycheck to paycheck or borrowing from my future self.

M. Night Shyamalan is going to direct an Avatar movie.  On the one hand, that sounds really cool.  On the other hand, the thought of the same person who directed Sixth Sense suddenly taking an interest in a children's cartoon kind of makes my head explode.  Really... what the fuck?

Projected timeline for moving out of the house is the end of February, roughly, depending on my ability to resist going on a spending spree with all the money that's no longer disappearing from my paycheck.  Projected time for finding more significant employment is... *sigh.*

Winter is depressing me, a bit, mostly due to inversion in the valley that pretty much makes exercising outside a death sentence for your lungs.  More sunlight would be a tasty fruit right now, and being able to go for a run would be nice too.  Kind of sad that I no longer have access to a treadmill, being out of school now.

Musically, I've found out that I like Erasure.  The Stephen Hawking-esque voice version of Video Killed The Radio Star cracks me up a bit.  

Also, I'm getting in the habit of using Wikipedia.  I know it's not totally reliable, but it's nice to be able to find out what random references mean.  And so, to conclude:

Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.

The world 'tis a wondrous place indeed.  And winter won't last forever."

I've been teetering on the edge of being sick all week, but I think I'm still on the top side.  Or is it the good side?  Maybe I'm the bad guy in this scenario.  I am, after all, responsible for the deaths of countless viri and bacteria.  What with the haircut last week, I'm pretty sure I have serial killer written all over me.  I really shouldn't leave that Sharpie out where my cat can get to it.

No job, but still hoping.  I have a harder time staying motivated when it gets cold and grey.  And when I'm feeling vaguely ill.  

Christmas was... well... blah.  Nothing happened, really.  I got no present love from anyone, except a pair of pjs from my stepsister.  Funny, I've never had pjs before, so it was kind of cute.  The not getting presents thing was OK, since I didn't want anything that isn't on its way already in some form, and so far everybody seemed to enjoy what I got them, which is just as good.  Except a few things which haven't been sent.  I hate waiting for things in the mail -- one of the downsides of buying things online, even if they are invariably cheaper.  So, for want of item x, item y hasn't been created yet, and boxes z and zz are both waiting on y.  That's all I'm going to say about that.

What's in store for the new year?  It's kind of hard to think about.  I think I should travel more, once I plant my money tree and collect my first harvest.    

Speaking of money trees, I've been reading a really interesting book called <u>The Undercover Economist</u>.  It's not that it will probably change the way I act as a consumer, so much as it provides a lot of insight as to why things work the way they do, economically speaking.  I mean, I'll never be able to look at a menu without trying to figure out why some things are priced the way they are again.  Or go shopping.

I'll probably be looking for more brain food when I finish the book, but I think tomorrow will be devoted to old movies and pizza, and perhaps playing Set.  Actually, I kind of wish I had a jigsaw puzzle right now.  Maybe I'll check out my source for satisfying all of whimsical and fleeting desires: dollar stores.  They're definitely a fruit."

"event","Well, it's almost here!  OK, I have to admit, I'm more excited about having a paid day off of work than I am about Christmas itself, which probably says something deep and meaningful about me, like that I either need to find a new job or more people to hang out with.  It's old news now. 

Today I launched a pre-emptive strike.  Tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of the enemy had their existences cut short by my willful and brutal attack.  The carnage was terrible.  I have no regrets... I'd do it again.  Some may argue that it's dehumanizing to act this way... but I don't care.  The victims deserved it -- they earned their demise through their blatant disregard for my wishes and whims.

OK, I take it back -- I do have one regret.  I regret not choosing the location of my assault more carefully.  Shaving one's head over the sink is just asking for disaster.  I had the foresight to close the drain first, but I still get minus 5 I.Q. points for not choosing to do it somewhere that could easily be swept and vacuumed.

There's a new job opening that looks promising.  The catch?  I have to overcome my introverted nature and actually call the company to inquire further.  Don't these people understand that applicants feel safer interacting strictly through the internet?  How could they be so inconsiderate!!?

Yeah, sounds flimsy to me too.  Once Tuesday rolls around, I'll have to pluck up my courage and follow through.  Not to mention launching various cross-country projects and starting my apartment shopping in earnest.  OK, that last one can wait until next year. 

Since I plan on avoiding going outside for the next couple of days (between crazed last-minute shoppers and heavy inversion, I'd be taking my life into my own hands by doing so), I can finally get caught up on some music stuff and reading.  And laundry.  There always seems to be laundry.  I could save a bunch of time and money by becoming a nudist.  I'd have frostbite within three seconds of stepping out the door, people would constantly be pointing and laughing, and I'd be arrested for indecent exposure, but I wouldn't have to do laundry ever again.  It almost seems like a fair trade."

"event","I'm happy that my head doesn't hurt today.  I think I've had a mild headache for the past two days straight, probably something to do with my diet -- cheese fries, while yummy, have consequences later on for my tummy and apparently my head in some connected way.  

I started looking at apartments online (because I'm lazy and I don't want to go outside today, it being grey and cold) and found a couple that might work.  I mean, it's not like my criteria are very demanding -- ~$500 a month, roughly 500 square feet of living space, and with as many utilities paid as possible.  While it'd be nice to go to a pet-friendly place in case I feel compelled to take in a kitten, I think I'd better worry about taking care of myself for a while.  I think I might have enough money to move in sometime in February or March.  Sooner if I find another job, of course.  Hope springs eternal.

I've been thinking about this for a while -- if you had to choose one song/musical piece to summarize your whole life, what would it be?  A minor caveat would be that you don't get to explain why.  And of course, no song is going to be perfect.  I'm still trying to come up with mine.

I should almost finish shopping today.  Tomorrow there's a long overtime shift for me, perhaps preceded by a run, perhaps not.  I really should get some reading done -- I haven't touched a book in weeks.  Maybe aliens have taken over my body.

EDIT: Apparently, the first time I posted this, I mistyped Freshmen for my music as Freshment, which led me to Fresh Mint, which made me wonder how horrible it would be if your life was summarized by an advertising jingle..."

And lo, the human did see that there were Dirty Things that required cleansing at the temple of Washing Machine.

Verily, he gathered the Dirty Things and transported them to the temple, and yea, the cat did follow.

Yea, the human did sort through his pockets looking for Loose Change and other Bric-a-Brac, and the cat proceeded with sniffing the Dirty Things.

And so commenceth the placing of the dirty things in the temple, there to be purified by the holy Soap and Water.

Meanwhile, the cat observeth this ritual, and comprehending it not, proceedeth to investigate more closely.

Lo, the cat entereth the sacred temple, climbing atop the Dirty Things, and finding the Dirty Things suitable for relaxation, the cat reclineth thereon.

And the human was struck with consternation, forseeing great calamity if the cat remaineth in the temple upon the advent of Soap and Water, and he beseeched the Lord cat, saying ""What the hell art Thou doing in there?""

And the cat did ignore him.

Whereupon, the human continued placing the Dirty Things atop the cat, hoping to dislodge him from the sacred place.

And the cat did smile contentedly.

When all hope seemeth lost, the human did place the Heavy Jeans upon the cat, and the cat was perturbed, and did seek exit from the temple.

And the cat giveth unto the human the Crusty Look.

So speaks the sacred text.

In other news, I came within a hairsbreadth of proving my total idiocy by falling for an old scam relating to my digital camera search.  I was angry and annoyed about that, but I don't know if it was because I should have known better, or because I shouldn't have had to know better.

I had a talk with my parents about my impending departure -- it felt kind of weird, because I don't think we're on the right sides.  I mean, aren't they the ones supposed to be pushing me out the door to go make a life for myself and I'm supposed to be dragging my heels saying how much easier it is where I am?  They're worried I'll be too isolated, which is probably true.  But I'm already pretty isolated, and I don't even have the independence to go with it.  That which does not kill you... blah blah... makes you long for cookies.  Or something.  I mean, I'm not totally well in the head, by my own judgement, but I think I'm safe enough to be on my own.  And even if I'm not, shouldn't I be screwing up and finding that out?

Meh.  I feel like I'm too old for this.  Probably true."

In unrelated news, it's quite cold.  I mean like piss freezing before it hits the toilet cold.  (really, it's very musical)  As i was walking through six inches of snow to check the mail, it occurred to me that perhaps I should have put on real shoes instead of flip-flops.  And then when I was waiting outside the guard shack in my shorts, I slowly came to the conclusion that  Winter cared not one whit for my denial of its wrath, or for the fact that it is several weeks premature.  I came close to being reduced to a fleshy popsicle today, and I probably would have been carved up and distributed to a supermarket as a new ""mystery"" flavor in the frozen foods section.  I'm sure there's plenty of mystery in the world without my frozen corpse confusing the issue.  Although small children do make the best guinea pigs for this kind of thing.  Other than real guinea pigs, of course.  

I need to go to bed before I get too distracted.  I'll have to stop kicking and screaming some other day."

We had our Turkey Day today instead of Thursday.  I think, for once, I only overate by about 40% instead of the usual 100.  It probably helped that I felt an urge to consume a largish salad.  I'm really starting to appreciate Annie's Shitaake Sesame dressing, which means there might be hope for me going vegan someday.  Nahhh.

Tomorrow I'll try to decide if I should spend some of my b-day money on stuff I don't really need or not.  I'm sort of thinking I might want my own digital camera, but I'm a little put off by having to do the research to determine what's best.  Maybe it can wait another half year or so.

Question of the day: Is love (with a semi-assumed ""romantic"" preceding love) immature?  

This spawned from a comment in a book I was reading on singles life vs. marriage.  The book brought up a lot of interesting points on why people from generation X have a hard time getting married, but it was kind of hard not to take everything with a grain of salt, as the success and failure stories seem just as easily explained by percentages.  Don't know why I was reading this book in the first place -- I'm not even a member of the target audience, and it was obvious within three pages that this was the case, so I have no excuse for finishing the damn thing.  But I did, and there's nothing I can do about it now.

I've been exploring volunteering opportunities, and one that really caught my eye was being a victim advocate for people affected by domestic violence.  On the one hand, I have no experience with such a thing, and I don't know how well I could deal with the real life stress these people are going through, but then, it sounds more... I don't know, needed? than the other things I was looking at.  I'm thinking I'll start with something safer and check back in a couple of months.

I've checked a couple of more places for potential jobs, and seen a few that look plausible, but I haven't sent my resume anywhere else yet.  

I had to go back to work yesterday, and found out I really liked sleeping during ""normal"" hours.  Back in my pre-college days I was slightly a morning person, so maybe underlying years of night shifts is that same morning person struggling to break free.  Probably has something to do with biorhythms or mental wiring or astrology.  Yeah, it's Saturn's fault.  

I have this urge to unhook from all safety nets, real or imagined, move to a new city and just see what happens.  I mean, I have enough fake retirement money to do it, so why not?  My common sense is so far stifling the urge, but I keep having this nagging suspicion that my common sense is just plain wrong.  Sigh.

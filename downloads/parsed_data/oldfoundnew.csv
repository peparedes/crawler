"event","listen to 20 songs, write lyrics from each then have people guess what they are. dont use the title in the lyrics.

1. racing to find you and losing our way back to 
the end of you. racing to lose you and finding our way back to 
thoughts of you. until now, my eyes understood 

2. Better save the hot hot seat for the emperor. He's the arsonist, yeah I got the evidence.

3.  your fax machine can fax me back and get in touch with my cappucino maker.

4.  you get up and dance around the room -- my eyes are on you. 

5. she said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go. she couldn't scream while I held her close. I swore I'd never let her go.   

6. the radio is playing our tune. I love it, could you turn it down? the thought of you crying in my room. I miss you, could you come around sometime?

7.  Boat remembers the carpenter's sure hand. Missing fishy flutter on it's rudder. Sold at an auction, on a dolly ever since. Sometimes rainy days drop boyish wonder.

8. and another night hangs at the end of it's rope. and  our held-off white hours bleeds three shades to the wind... the turn table turns, and the organ comes in. 

9. don't blame yourself, it was everyone around that made you act you this way. there's a stage, and a chance to watch it go down.  

10.  but though times have brought change, I've accepted the fact that you don't understand me.

11. I know, by the look in your eyes it's time to go. We rub our legs like crickets. kicking cans and stones. Make it electric. I've got to know I'm still alive 

12. what once was lost was what once was not. 

13.  wash it from my eyes, all the sad goodbyes, make me feel again. leave me here, to reconcile these unfinished plans...love broke me. 

14. And old townies are tired of the beaches and bars
being packed so tight.And bridges, and traffic, and inlets, are locked in their fight.

15.  but the fucking kids in front of us, were really really tall! I got kicked in the head more than one time...

16.  we won't say, we won't bleed

17. I got a key to the door where nobody knows me...

18.  angel, I can see myself in your eyes...

19. maybe we could blame our culture for what it did, our parents for what they didn't do.

20.  And this is why I am leaving. And this is why I can't see you no more. This is why I am lying when I say that I don't love you no more 




bah."

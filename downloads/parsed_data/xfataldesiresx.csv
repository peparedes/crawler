"event","I couldn't make an entry about 2005 in my other journal, not when most of the year was spent updating this. 

It isn't a very happy new years at all. I'll make a happy post telling you all that later. The fact is, I'm not happy. I thought I could be happy with every opportunity/mistake I have taken recently. If there's one thing I've learned from this year it is to be content and to be grateful. Nothing will go back and change anything from 2005 and to be honest I don't think I'll miss most of it. '05 was filled with mistakes, mistakes, and more mistakes. Maybe it was just a bad ending but I think it really was just a bad year. There's alot wrong with me and there's alot I could say. I did alot of flat out fucked up shit this year. I've never felt such a wicked slap of karma these past couple of months and I know I deserve it. I wish I could see this year as something new, some sort of hope. But I can't. I can't see anything but all the mistakes I've made. All the pain I caused myself and everyone else. It's bad enough to hurt someone who doesn't deserve it but to hurt someone you love is even worse. I've only loved 3 people. And as of tonight, I've hurt all three. I'm sick of it. 

I have to go visit an old Christian women weekly with bibles on her shelf and a pshyciatric degree. I wish I still believed. I'd at least have something then. I see all of these religious women and men that are so happy sometimes about who they worship but I just can't believe. I've tried and there's nothing. I can't figure myself out and I'm tired of trying. I know there's something wrong with me. I know there's probably alot but knowing doesn't help when you can't stop. I've gone through an endless cycle of ways to hurt myself this year and they've all been ridiculous. This year has been dissappointment. Not the kind you feel when your plans get cancelled or when your phone call isn't return. It was the kind where not only do your plans get cancelled on count of rain but you get rained on too and fall in the mud. But it was like you were the one that made it rain and you made it rain for everyone else too. Gah, that was a shitty comparison. 

I could be hopeful and say I'll get fixed. Maybe I'll quit putting myself in the worst of situations. I could hope for that. I could hope to start making plans with my friends like I used too. I could have a great relationship. I could make good grades. I could I could I could. I can say I could or would all night but I'll never say I can. I'm done with wishful thinking. I don't know if I can pull myself together again. All this time that's all I've been hoping for and now I'm not even sure if I want to try anymore.

I can't say any resolutions. I know I won't even try for them and why should I when there will only be dissppointment or yet another mistake to make? I won't say I won't hurt anyone again. I know I will and I know I won't mean to and regret just as much as I do everytime. I won't say I'll be happy because I'll be lucky if I can be. I won't say I'll make everything right because I can't. I won't say alot of shit. Like I said, I'm done and through with wishful thinking. 

please please be a better year...

here's to 2006.

I'm sorry."

"event","Today I wore my ""gunz jacket"" and acted very dorky, all day. I also got a wonderful rose drawn for me and I put it on my wall. Overall school was extremely easy/boring but I didn't mind. I enjoyed today's weather even though I stepped in a giant puddle. My parents have gone on this cleaning rampage so the house smells like dusting spray, not lysol, dusting spray. I can't even talk on the phone because of all the chaos of ""omg we have to clean in time for your sister and the babies"" even though their house is a mess when we go to visit them. I helped out some but mainly I've just been hiding out upstairs watching movies.

"event","20 things about you most people don't know, tag 6 others

1. I have a hard time talking, even to my friends.
2. I really just like being held.
3. Tuna grosses me out more than it should.
4. I am paranoid and easily startled.
5. I'm actually very talkative despite how much that contradicts #1.
6. I love polka dots.
7. Everything I write online or with a picture, won't make sense unless you ask me, even if you think you know what I mean. 
8. I have a horrible temper and I'm sorry.
9. I only play video games to escape reality.
10. Large crowds bother me, sometimes.
11. I like emails alot but no one ever sends any.
12. There is a birth mark on my right knee shaped like virginia/a backwards NC depending on how you look at it.
13. Sadly enough, I spend most of my time on the internet.
14. I avoided getting my permit for so long because I'm scared of dieing in a car crash.
15. Incorrect English bothers me, not as much as when it's written (because I do it too), but when it's spoken. I have a teacher who says ""dat"" instead of ""that"" daily.
16. I've been avoiding social situations lately because I feel guilty. I think I'll stop but everytime I say that, it just happens all over again. Make me hang out with you.
17. I always want to hug people when I'm in a good mood, but I never do.
18. I don't know how to react when people take pictures of me because I'm used to taking pictures of every one else.
19. I'm a hopeless romantic. If a guy gave me a rose I'd either fall in love with him or never forget it.
20. America disgusts me, I'm moving away."

I didn't think Mrs. Castleberry could talk through 2 class periods but apparently I was wrong. The class doesn't seem all that bad. I just didn't realize we had to print our own pictures.

English was okay. I just seem to be surrounded by gangsters and a couple of rednecks but the teacher wasn't bad.

Travel period was nice :) even though it was hot and nick wouldn't stfu. 

Lunch...Lunch was boring. It basically consisted of Ryan talking about how high he was and seeing random people and just kind of sitting there with Byron. Oh! and cookies, can't leave out those. 

5th period was Environmental Science HN. Basically I'm stuck in a class where I know absolutely no one and most of the people are seniors. I think I'll just be quiet in that class...

Algebra 2, what a lovely class. argh. I did know Kate and Kathleen which was a nice change from not knowing anyone at all but the teacher is horrible. He's not mean but from what I can tell he can't really teach X_X

US History with Mr Rickert, what can I say. He's very ermm...animated!

Alphabetical seating annoys me and it was weird wearing make up.

I've still played video games, slept, and talked on the phone most of the day. Alot of good things seemed to happen this summer and alot of bad but I don't think I minded. I needed this summer to be consistant and away from most of friends despite how I wish I hadn't at all. This summer was plain but I feel better now.

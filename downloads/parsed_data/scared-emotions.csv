<h2>You Are a <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/circusfreak.html"">Circus Freak</a>!</h2>
Sex standing on your head? Check!<br>
Prison sex fantasies? Check!<br>
Triple penetration? Check!
<br><br>
You've done more stuff than Dr. Ruth has heard of!<br>
A peaceful Saturday involves installing a <b><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/hnuw"" target=""_blank"">sex swing</a></b>...<br>
Or recovering from last night's flogging section.
<br><br>
Advice? Well, you don't need any in the kink department.<br>
But I'd say, slow down, let your partner take the lead.<br>
You might be surprised how it feels to be the one with your legs in the air.

<h2>Your Sexual Energy is <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/blue.htmls"">Blue</a>!</h2>
Blue represents an experimental mindset, and an unpredictability that you are only in touch with.<br>
You are not pure, nor are you totally naughty. You are on the borderline.<br>
Will you fall into complete kinkiness, or will you back up into being a normal girl?<br> 
<br>
Your strength is your open-mindedness to try new things.<br>
You are confident to follow-through on your lover's fantasies.<br> 
You often even add your own special edge to them.<br>
<br>
Do they want to be tied down?<br>
Well, how about a massage first, and then tickles to drive them crazy?<br>
Blue women know how to mix and match and come out with extraordinary results.<br> 
<br>
You go about snagging your partners by sneaking up to them and then playing twenty questions.<br> 
Your targets are often puzzled by your ability to draw out their darkest secrets on a first date.<br> 
However, you still like to keep your own secrets to yourself.<br>
<br>
You could spice your sex life up a bit if you let go of some of your own secrets, and let it all hang out!<br>
Tell 'em your desires.<br>
You might just surprise yourself!<br> 
<br>
Carmen Electra and Catherine Zeta Jones, although both very different celebs, have been honing this blue sexual energy. 
Follow their lead!<br>
<br>
And, for some compatible lovers, look for those who have sexual energies in the colors of red, gray, and brown.

If there were an ""extra vanilla flavor"", that would be you.<br>
So you're a bit on the conservative side, sexually.<br>
Maybe you're a bit new to the game - or a bit shy.<br>
Either way, furry cuffs are the perfect way to spice things up a little.

You are enormous fun to be with, endearing to<br>everyone, and easy to trust.  Also, you can<br>help more timid partners through what might<br>otherwise turn out to be embarassing<br>moments.<br><br>
The dynamic lover is an exhilarating individual who<br>charges any situation with exciting,<br>spontaneous energy.  You will very often come<br>up with something bold, new, and shocking; in<br>the bedroom or in everyday life.  Life is never<br>dull with a man or a woman who is gifted with<br>this energetic brand of dynamism.  But beware<br>of going too far.  You may have a habit of<br>overlooking the needs and personality of your<br>lover when you devote all your energy to<br>absorbing schemes.  Maybe you should spend more<br>time asking what would please and captivate<br>your partner, and less on yourself.  But your<br>partner should not let this distract him or her<br>from the excitement and exuberance you can<br>bring to almost every aspect of sexuality, love<br>and life.

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/V/valeriana/1066558374_ubtlelover.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Subtle Lover""><br><b>Subtle</b><br><br>
You like it when eroticism has been built up to<br>such a level that it only takes a sexy look to<br>make you feel weak at the knees.  Sexual games<br>really appeal since, for you, good sex happens<br>in the brain.<br><br>
The subtle lover is a master of eroticism because a<br>subtle mind can take hold of fine nuances of<br>suggestion and allow them to develop into<br>something creative and different.  You are<br>fortunate in having such a distinctive<br>imagination linked with the ability to<br>understand your unique and special sexual<br>impact.  The downside is that as a subtle lover<br>you may come to require elaborate fantasies for<br>total satisfaction.  A major task in life,<br>therefore, is to discover a partner whose<br>inventiveness and imagination match up - a mind<br>and personality that compliment your own.  This<br>will not always be easy, but it's definitely<br>worth holding out for the right person.<br>Together you can explore an exciting world of<br>luscious sensuality and pure eroticism that<br>most couples desire but never attain.

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/V/valeriana/1066572101_aringlover.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Caring lover""><br>Caring <br><br>
You are one of those rare people who takes the time<br>to think about your partner's feelings.  You<br>see a lover in terms of pure romance even when<br>he/she behaves badly.  Just don't get taken for<br>granted.<br><br>
Men and women who genuinely care about others'<br>welfare and feelings are lamentably rare<br>creatures.  The best way in which to show such<br>caring is to act quietly on your beliefs,<br>thereby making yourself indispensable in the<br>most erotic and thoughtful way.  You don't<br>waste time telling the world your feelings;<br>instead you get on with your life.  Yet because<br>you don't look for attention you suffer the<br>possibility of being taken for granted.  This<br>is one of the most damaging things that can<br>happen in a relationship.  So remember to ask<br>for your own needs to be met as well.  A little<br>selfishness could be better for both of you in<br>the long run.  The chances are that your<br>partner will be pleased to discover what you<br>really like, and how best to turn you on.  You<br>may find that the quality of your sex life<br>shows radical improvement.

You possess enough inner security to deal with your<br>partner having a life of his/her own.  You are<br>able to tackle the occassional jealous twinge<br>by inviting a 'rival' to dinner instead of<br>making a fuss.<br><Br>
Nothing can rattle the strong lover.  You have<br>developed a kind of inner courage that allows<br>you to deal with your difficulties without<br>getting upset and lets you provide a shoulder<br>to cry on when things get tough.  Best of all,<br>you are unlikely to get jealous about either<br>petty things or real infidelities.  This<br>doesn't mean that your partner can et away with<br>lying and cheating.  Instead, you might simply<br>pack your bags one day and walk out the door.<br>If this happens your lover could discover that<br>he/she has lost a solid and reliable partner,<br>someone well worth holding on to.  But then,<br>the strong silent type isn't neccessarily<br>everyone's cup of tea.  In bed you are not<br>overtly wild and explicit, but your lover can<br>sense deep currents of passion that flow<br>beneath the surface.

Hotel California (1976)
Hotel California

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place (background)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
Any time of year (background)
You can find it here
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany twisted
She's got the Mercedes bends
She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
Please bring me my wine
He said
We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely Place
Such a lovely Place (background)
Such a lovely face
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise
What a nice surprise (background)
Bring your alibies

Mirrors on the ceiling
Pink champagne on ice
And she said
We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
Relax said the nightman
We are programed to recieve
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave"

"event","Deele Two Occasions Lyrics 


A summer love is beautiful
But it's not enough
To satisfy emotions
That are shared between us
A winter love is cozy
But I need so much more
It just intensifies my wants
To have a love that endures

'Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I wanna be with you
Wherever you are

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right

An autumn love is special
At this time of the year
But when the leaves are gone
Does that love disappear
I never underestimate the new love of spring
But I'm glad to say in my heart
I know my love's lasting

'Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I wanna be with you
Wherever you are

(chorus) 2x

'Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I wanna be with you
Wherever you are

(chorus) 2x"

Why do we scream at each other?

"event","Damn so lots have happened. School is getting better thankfully. I performed at AIOTS. If anybody saw that, I was comin' off the top. It went well from the crowd reaction. Ethan and Justin ripped it. I was okay. But I blanked out at the end though hahahhaa. All good All good. Today was a good day. I ran into Johnson knows who  a couple of times which made my day well. I was very happy to see her around and I can only hope she felt the same. Last night, I'd like to think I helped out two close friends. Long long story that I can't get into, but I'm happy she's giving him a chance. This brings me to my next topic. I lost a friend, not like they died or anything because Lord knows I've had too many of those, but I decided to say fuck it. And I'm doing this on grounds that I worned them about. In my eyes right now, they shady. That's all there is to it. Anyway, I ain't gonna ramble on about it here, so they can find out why. They gotta ask and I dunno if I'll answer. I'm  just fed up. I'll show her respect as long as she does the same, but I dunno what else I can do. Anyway that concludes the good and bad, PCN sucks major dick right now. Dick sucks major PCN. And to be truthful, I'm teetering on whether or not to stay in it. I'm serious. I mean no one is going to sway me either way. It's my decision. But I just don't know anymore. Oh well I stay smiling though."

"event","It's been a while so I'mma jus get my feelings out and tell y'all what I've been up to. All right, so basically, a couple things on my mind are Valentine's Day, school and Imaginasian and the kickback afterwards. Oh yea and fuckin' PCN too. Anyway first off, Valentine's Day was cool I kicked with my home girl it was a nice night. REAL NICE NIGHT. No need for details, aight? School has been buggin me especially since I don't understand half the shit I should. Also, I have my chem and math midterm ON THE SAME DAY. I ain't frontin like that's never happened but it doesn't help the stress level. Nah mean? So basically I am studying chemistry tomorrow and prolly math whenever I can. I am so fucked. But I pray i am not. What's really been on my head was this kick back after Imaginasian. All right man, in the knowledge that I'll sound fuckin crazy and what not, I'll tell you what happened in the perspective of retrospect. Okay, me, B-mac and some mk modern heads were chillin at my homegirl Jade's house. Btw, Jade, if you read this, I just wanted to let you know you are fuckin cool man. FOR SERIOUS. Anyway, me and this girl that I really didn't know that well got into a really deep and heavy conversation about stuff that's been buggin me. And I mean that conversation and who it was with was exactly what I needed. I walked away from that conversation a lot more mature. And I'm glad we both gave each other the satisfaction of reassurance. And if they ever read this, I just want them to know. That conversation, to me, was a blessing. Why? Cuz maybe, if only for that conversation, I spoke to an angel. For the things you said, you deserve whatever you want. I'm not gonna lie, shit was touching. Now don't get it twisted, start talkin like oh Cyril's on this girls nuts and what not. Nah man, but when you are able to connect with an acquaintance to the point where y'all walk away as homies. Well I mean, that's just a beauty of life. They might not remember, but it happened and in reality, that's all that matters. That's what's been new with me. OHHH yeaa btw, I did some spoken word and people were feelin it. Me and Matt got new song ideas for the LP, GOOD SHIT!"

"event","I've had moments of weakness with people that have done nothing to deserve them. I've treated good people like absolute shit, almost like they don't matter. I'm a damn fool. And I know words can only say so much. I've made really large mistakes that I know I won't make again, but it still remains that I shouldn't have made them and put people in that position. What's worse is that some people think what happened with a certain girl didn't affect me to a deeper level. Yes, I did change because of it and I take it as a lesson. I understand that I hurt her very deeply and pissed her off hella much. It was a moment of true immaturity just like how I slipped into a depression and had serious contemplations about taking my life because of that same situation the following summer before my second year of college. So don't tell me I was only marginally affected cuz I was so fucking close. I'm not takin away from her, I'm just sayin my side. Why did I put this on here? Because I wanted you to know."

And I'm scared of what it may or may not bring. It's like everyday brings new people and different people from what I'm used to. And that in turn makes me feel uncomfortable but at the same time makes me comfortable getting to know people so much. Okay now that I got that outta the way........I need to rant about something. Ethan and Roman are right. Words can only say so much and words are garbage, respectfully. And it's becoming quite obvious like it always has been that I'm the only one who gave a damn.

Been searchin for your type like the protagonist of Princess Bride.
Cuz you know I'll Say Anything jus to see you smile,

Of course, my mood is highly dependent on what the doctor determines why I have this swollen lymphnode in the back of my head. I hope it was because of the flu virus I had earlier this fall. I am currently in the home of Alexa Gacutan, enjoying Shopao(sp????), and might I say I'm having a mighty good time chillin with her. I always do. It's funny how close we have become ever since we broke up. Is there another relationship or a second time around in the works? As you know, only time will tell. I am just happy and relieved that she is doing well since her recent injury. Things on my mind and the emotion I have felt throughout this break have been crazy. I have felt excitement as well as overall joy upon the news that I got lead role in PCN. I have felt sadness and utter depression upon pondering just what the fuck this bump is behind my head. I have smiled hard through the realization of how blessed I am with family and friends. Even those girls that are borderline friends. I am sad though because I really wanted to kick it with one Christian Garrucho and one Matthew ""The Glock"" McLaughlin this break but I have heard no news from either. But I figure we will have a lot of time for all that during Christmas break. I have felt so much frustration and confusion about just what to write my ASA paper on. I have had a lot thoughts in my mind, mainly where I stand in the lives of my friends/good friends/homies. It's like I am clear where they lie, but where do I lie in their lives? I will just have to have faith that they look upon me and keep me in high regards as I do to them. But hey whatever you know? One girl in particular has got me confused but I have no clue where to go, looks like I'm jus ordinary eh? Shout out to Sam London for having to spend these holidays alone. I will try to visit you because I know you need it. Today, I got to kick it with my homie/former interest Anjelica, and we kicked it and had a nice and innocent time. Much to my relief and probably her too. It was kinda awkard since I have not seen her in a long long long time. But that's okay, we just picked up where we left off friendship wise. Anyway, my family is blowing up my cell to come home so I must end this prematurely. Anyway, y'all have a good rest of break.

P.S. It's funny how some people think they know me to my very bone, but they have no clue about what the things personality holds.  They just see me and think they can figure me out through what they see. That's like reading a poem on the surface.  Now I'm not speaking to anyone specific but some people. 

P.P.S. Damn it Melissa I called you to help you on your paper and you do not even answer your phone. WTF? LOL, jp. 

P.P.P.S. I'll holla at y'all when I see you. Shout out to Patrick Pascual, Ceyx Torado and Stephen Aglubat."

pushes me down to the point I wanna be like fuck this shit,
Reading potential as 0 on all digits.
But y'all couldn't understand my plight.
You can't understand it like, 
you never seen the difficulty,
You never seen your dream's potentially become minimally
No hope and my life are on the same boat.
Closer and closer to zero, just like an asymptote.
So, this On S1ghT spittin it so freely.
You know me and how I would like life to be idealy.
And you just oh yea really?
Yessir, Yes ma'am,
look at the cracks in my hand
Just don't understand."

You forget my name and forget my face.
You can't even remember the times and place
where we laughed and smiled
for a while
on the phone,
at your home.
I thought we was for serious?
It's like now that I see what's happenin?
I wonder how were those feelings genuine?
who knows? I see more on the horizon than just her face.
I am now able to see that someone can take her place.
Flip that on the same token, vice versa.
All started around circa
tonight,
all right?
So maybe I'm a lil broken from the harsh truths and realities,
like an aspiring kid hit by generalities.
Man, better yet, this ain't the end of my line.
I will accomplish greater things in my life time.

"event","Here's the deal,
So last night old feelings rushed in,
left me so mad, whole night I was cussin.
But just then, you know what fuck a beef,
I don't care if you got much with me.
Cuz it's a must I see,
that I guess our friendship wasn't much to me,
or more much to thee, cuz if it did well,
she wouldn't be saying fuck cyril literally,
I can't believe feelings still the same,
so much to the point you can't utter my name,
So I musta made you mad to a point I can't imagine.
Thinkin damn don't even believe what happened.
I changed and you think I'm still hella immature.
I mean I know I can't get back things to the way they were.
Man, if that's how you see it then fine
Grudges are for hypocrites,
I don't mind if you feel this a lil bit,
if you wanna hate me, then fine hate me,
when you should know you were the thing that saved me.
Makin me finally grow and not see things like a baby.
Is that so crazy? 
I'm jus sayin that's some real hatred, cuz I'm jus like
Damn I even told my ex what happened that night.
Damn if you really feel like that, I really musta hurt you.
And it's like damn I asked for forgiveness in church too.
I felt awful what I did and I wish I could take it back.
Now i'm just whatever when it comes to all that.
It don't matter if you never see me again,
thinkin I don't ever wanna see him.
Well then, I guess that's the end.
But even you gotta admit
that it was a dope week when we had a friendship.
And if you don't admit it, then you shouldn't be so mad.
You shouldn't give a fuck about the friendship me and you had.
I used to think I would go through the impossible
with failure so probable
usin my own patience for fuel,
go that lengths not to holler but just be cool.
ANd if you don't give people a second chance 
how you suppose to expect people to give you a chance.
So it's okay I wasn't invited to you home,
just thought I'd write you this poem.
that I don't have no regret in my heart.
cuz I was doomed to learn the hard way at the start."

"event","Dear Jesus,
I just wanted to ask you some questions.
How come I'm scared in the dark when I'm alone in the dark?
Why do I have dreams where I end up lined in chalk?
Why is it that I'm caught up in situations that cause me to lie?
Am I really going to see you and my mama, after I die?
And if I may to take a second,
I would love it if I could for the record,
But yea why do i see visions of people screamin?
Why am I still scared, when God gave me the power to defeat my own demons?
Why does the most random bad shit happen to me?
And it's a sad sight, no matter what that happens to be.
If it's truth I sought, how come I just seek it?
I never wanted bullshit, but somehow I reach it.
Better yet, it reaches me except,
It's consistant, damn what's next?
okay well if that's order,
Thanks for the 5 dollar bill and the quarter
Watch out for me and everyone's sons and daughters,
Watch out for them folks when the hurricane comes through,
And thanks when I do wrong, you tell me shame on you,
So thanks for keeping me the right path,
Never setting me up to fail or crash,
Somehow I just end up laughs,
I do bad sometimes, but it's good that I meant though,
Amen, Your brother Cyril from Sacramento."

"event","I don't wanna write a rhyme right now so I thought I'd put some things on here that were on my mind. So, that  christian what a crazy guy. I hope he comes to davis but something in me wishes more that he succeeds with that girl he likes. He really deserves whomever he wants. I have come to notice that I am really blessed with great friends. You know there's more to people than what they let you know. And when you see what people are about like the oh so bad and the damn right good. It's like a learning experience. What about me? well, I ain't post so y'all ain't gotta do no work that's gay shit. anyway, I'm excited about today. In the words of General William F. Garrison hours before the Somali Raid, ""Today we go."" And it's true in a way it is time for me to go and move out. I love my house and my family but I would like to be on my own again. So today is a big day. I gotta get food and extra shit on base and then hopefully ceyx will have time to bring some extra  stuff from the house to my apartment. THis is all of course if he baskets his birds early which I doubt but oh well u know I'm chill. Also, tomorrow is the long awaited arrival of MR. DAVID CHAPPELLE. I can't wait I'll be the first one NOT to yell rick james bitch. Speaking of which, I'm fuckin sick of chappelle show, just watched so much of it. well this year's anticipations are over before it even started. I mean the whole thing with jenn is just a whatever thing now. I mean I don't really see myself doing PCN and being involved in MK. Yea i know again. So now I think janette's gonna try to persuade me and that's chill. I'm mostly looking forward to IM football and volleyball this year. I'mma fucka bang, I promise you. So well, my life hasn't gone on the right course but then again hey even Jesus had it rough. but you know as the chinese proverb says the glory is not in not failing, but rather in rising every time you fall. and in the words of the glock, in the future there will be robots. Anyway, so moving in is rough. But yea I'm just taking it all one step at a time. I mean seeing everybody again is something I look forward to. I mean it makes me wonder about the people I haven't seen yet like lizzie, homer, janette, mark, jenn, angela, sheila, peter, hey maybe even crystal. But I'm not gonna hold my breathe for that one. Yadidamean? Big ups to Roman for that one. Ummm yea like i said big day and i don't know where to put my furniture yet but it'll work out so they say but hey hey all right. All Roman needs is his thizz face while all I need is my rhymes. That's another reason I am looking forward to summer. Me and Phil are gonna try to get our CD made and distributed. of course with the help of jona. I'm just ready to get to writing you know? I'mma change the game, change my life, change my friends' lives and most of all change the world. Yes? a man can dream right? man I'm telling you that's why I always say ""gimme a beat and lemme make you proud"" 
Cuz you know what? I'mma give y'all the best of me.
Can't deny it? This fame shit was destiny.
Watch me as I make ""I Wish"" become ""I Am""
I've been angry lately and still kinda there but I'm chillin out. Oh yea and thanks for the talk AJ. And to my sister bibian, thanks too. If you read this, just know I got love for all y'all. YEA, ALL Y'ALL. Hit me up online or cell. THis is truly an On S1ghT PSA. Jahsan is king, there I said it. ummm yea Christian keep doin what you do, Matt B. i'll see you. Glock-u r the dopest mofucka I know. So many great people gotta smile about that."

"event","Your words are garbage and I can't believe 'em,
Cuz if you still got feelins for me, only stevie wonder can see 'em.
So imagine me, it's morning breathing in that summer air,
Hopin and wishin', for something no longer there.
I see it in my mind, as I stare at the sky,
And I think to myself, that I just don't know why,
I look down on the ground,
and what do I see now?
Flashes visions pop in my head,
of a life so comforting, not this life that happened instead.
Did I not try hard just to understand you?
Did I not want to be your man too?
So see the tears from my eyes as they roll,
cuz u had to replace in a manner so cold.
And you got nothing for me, feelings just a lil bit,
Thinkin' it'll be all the same with this friendship.
Man, you know i wanna be chill as I can,
That's what I'mma do as my plan,
I jus wanted to understand your mind, have it open.
It's been that way since that day we spent by the ocean.
And it's like once I heard sadness, now I hear the void,
Did I not make you cry tears of joy?
Did I not make you happy at all?
Did I not get you to lower your walls?
Damn man, I told people and even people who hate showed me love,
Shit it's so bad, even Roman gave me a hug,
And I'm thinkin really what did I actually do?
Nothin, cuz if there were somethings, you wouldn't be feelin him too.
So why did you make it seem that I should keep hope?
When all this is garbage now, my words, poems and notes.
You made me feel so special
and you were the one who talked about potential,
Now it's switch, cuz you see it in another name,
I guess you finally saw we ain't the same,
I'm me, he's him,
I don't wanna get wrapped in this drama that's just them.
And it's hard to move on, cuz you no longer care,
What about us huh? what happened to the stuff we shared?
I missed you and I'd just think that while I chilled at home.
And how I guess I really didn't make you smile at all on the phone.
I guess I didn't impress you with who I am,
Cuz damn, I guess I don't understand,
I guess that's why you went and played me,
and how come feelings haven't been strong lately.
Better yet, if I am wrong,
then how come that's all it took for u to be gone.
So from now on I guess, it's just me likin all over again,
thought all this came to an end,
But oh well, that's how u just want to be,
I gurantee u, you ain't gonna find neone like me,
People sayin yea cyril just got played.
And if I didn't, how come you gonna let them feelins fade.
And if it isn't this way, it's 2 AM, I shouldn't be writing this poem.
It's obvious it is this way, cuz we ain't on the phone."

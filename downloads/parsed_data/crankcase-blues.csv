"event","Someone described my latest roleplaying endeavor as this: <i>""Some wolf came in and was crazy. Then it died, and a gooey thing came out with tentacles.""<br /><br /></i>That made me giggle : )<br /><br /><b>Unnecessary Update: </b>Argh, damn you friends! The Douglas had a thing at work (always with the things, on weekends), and while he's free after 3PM, Rob needs to be back for a friend's show at 9. We called it off until next weekend but, for my holiday, I think I'm going to kick up my heels and chill.<br /><br />Doug will be coming much later tonight for some Clock Tower (you must realise how much of a pussy I am), but other than that I severely doubt that I'll be out of my pajamas all day today.<br /><br />Kickass~<br /><br />"

"event","Today I bought Clock Tower 3 (PS2) for $9.99. The original scared the living shit out of me, and that was 16-bit. It's predecessor (along with Res Evil, Silent Hill, and Fatal Frame) was just as bad on 8-bit, what with <b>dead babies stuffed in furnaces. <br /><br />Title: Clock Tower 3<br />Console: Playstation 2<br />Year Released: 2003<br />Genre: Survival Horror<br /><br /></b><div class=""ljcut"">In the original Clock Tower, the main nemesis was a a little boy with a sailor costume and gardening shears. The only music in the entire game is whenever you're chased by him and even then, it consists just of staccato notes and the occasional snip of his hedge clippers. <br /> <br /> As soon as I get around to putting an emulator on this computer, or track down the patches and translations for this rom (which are wickedly hard to find) I'll do a play by play for it too as right now, I'm thinking the original will be better.<br /><br />I'll be updating every once in a while, whenever I remember, so that I can have a thorough walkthrough by the end of this. I'm playing without a memory card, so... we'll see how that turns out.<br /><br />2AM- I've figured out the ending.<br /><br />2:02AM- Put in the wrong disc. Maybe later I'll do a walkthrough/review on my nephew's Nascar Race for the Cup but for now, let's stick with Clock Tower.<br /><br />2:14AM- The controls are jerky, and the camera angles leave much to be desired. Aside from that, I'm already much liking this game.<br /><br />- taking a break for the night -<br /></div>"

"event","I missed an important call during an ill-timed nap. When I saw my missed calls list, I saw that I had done so. Of course I called back, left a message, then carried my phone around with me. I happened by the john. 

You can guess what happened while your delicate writer was doing her stuff. 






I really hate phone tag."

"event","The Gentleman Companion and I are going to the (notso)Local Nature Center on Thursday, and I am excited about that because with him, I know that I'm going to be climbing some rocks and exercising. Yay.

It is 7:30AM and I'm about to call regarding my applications. I'm nervous, but excited. It isn't a, 'did I get the job' call but a, 'do you know I exist' one. That's the most pivotal: I applied, and I care, and you should hire me. Oyes.
-
I wasn't passive aggressive with the person I wanted to, and am relatively proud for not doing so. She asked me why I kept pacing with the phone, and I told her that I was expecting a call and it has a habit of going out of service. She then asked me about the places I've been going lately, I told her (in laymen's terms), but did not tell her what absolute crap she was making life around her. I did bring up things that shouldn't have been brought up but excuse me, I do not allow people to abuse me, and if you do then I won't allow myself to be drug into your mess.

It wasn't a heavy topic, but I asked why a court order hadn't been brought up yet. I understand that I need to watch what I say or do around her because of the things she has going on psychologically, but this was the woman who told me to ""Grin and bear"" three broken ribs, a fractured back and sprained neck while she literally drug me into nicer clothing so that I wouldn't embarass her at the hospital. Being cut out of expensive clothing and having freshly washed hair cut away was worth it, in her mind. I need to respect that.

On that note, she needs to respect my right to lead a life uninhabited by loony whack-a-doos."

"event","It's amazing how the mind works. I'm on a diet, so of course I want nothing more than some good pork gristle and a large Coke Icee right now. I'm trying to better my relations with folk, and again of course, the urge to tell them exactly what's on my mind right now is just stupidly hard to resist.<br /><br />I think about it, fantasize, about being wicked and letting my evil loose on them. It feels good and I have to keep my sentences curt to keep from doing so.<br /><br /><i>""Oh, yeah. Well I stopped going there, you know, after what you told me the other day I just don't want to anymore. Oh well.""</i><br /><br />It's passive-aggressive and so <i>catty </i>of me, but it's like cerebral masturbation or something. Usually I'm so wonderful at not being that person, but they've stressed and drama'd and brought so much obsessive lulz that it's starting to wear off on me.<br /><br />I won't say or do any of this, of course. It just feels so damn good to admit that I want to."

"event","It has been way to long since I wrote in this last, honestly. Everything is so fucked up right now it's not even funny. where to start.

well me and pat aren't going out anymore. I couldn't do it anymore so I broke it off. We lived together for about a year and that's all it took for me to realize i wan't happy at all. I had no friends, i couldn't do anything without getting accused of doing something and i felt trapped. 

So I met this new kid who i'm currently dating...BIG MISTAKE. This relationship is a joke.. that's all i have to say. It revolves around his ex and it's rediculous. I can't take it anymore and i don't know why i can't just get myself to leave. I hate being alone and that's what i don't want to happen. 


I miss Cudney....end of story. 


It think about the kid EVERYDAY and I know i'd be happy with him. I know I would"

"event","<P>So now seriously I'm going to try to keep this updated for everyone to read of what a mess up I really am...</P>
<P>I talked to one of my best friends last night and everything got blown out of proportion. Not to mention I made this person cry and I hate doing that. Well this person found out I still cut myself and that I did it again last night. I made a promise to them that I'd try to stop myself and they're gonna help me. I want to tell Pat (my bf) about all of it but I'm just scared that people aren't going to understand and I know he'll be upset with me. Especially if I just go right out and tell him ""Oh by the way I tried to kill myself last night.."" yea that won't go over to well. Today in school I just felt so down because of last night, and it made me realize that there really is something wrong with me and that I need help. I never knew what I was doing was hurting other people. I talked to this person all night,well more like cried, cause I don't want to do it anymore but it's just so much easier said then done.</P>
<P>I want to tell Pat everything and ask for his help because I think he could. I'm just scared though to tell him some stuff and I don't want to hurt him because of my stupidity. I just know, like I've said in earlier entry's, that I can't do this on my own. I really truly need help. I know now that I am not well. I'm to scared to talk to my parents because I know they won't understand. Just like my mom did. I don't believe in therapist's or them ""doctors"" who just make you feel worse about yourself after you've left then when you got there. I feel so sick and disgusted with myself I could just puke. I haven't been eating much lately, and when I think I'm hungry I try to eat but just the sight of it makes my stomach turn. Even my journal's. It's like it's starting to make things worse. I don't know why but it makes me feel worse about myself. The scars on my wrist from last night are going away, I kind of wish they wouldn't. I've been feigning it so bad lately. I get the gut feeling in my stomach and the shakes so bad. It makes me cry sometimes and freak out on my friends because I can't get what I want. I want this to stop and go away..I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THIS ANYMORE! It's making me feel worse then I did before I did it. I never felt this horrible about cutting and it's been three years. I think this time it really hit me to hear someone actually tell me that I am not well and there really&nbsp;<STRONG><EM><U>is</U></EM></STRONG> something wrong with me.&nbsp; I think that's what's bringing me down the most. I've known that there was something wrong with me I just never wanted to pay attention to it. The thing is I don't even know why I do it. My life isn't even something I can complain about. My friend told me that there is something there that's bugging me and causing me to do this to myself, something in the past or in the present. The more I think about that it just doesn't make any sense because I really don't think there is. What really got me down was when they said that if they find out that I'm still doing it then they are going to start doing it too. That's NOT what I want. I feel that no matter what I do and no matter how hard I try it'll never stop. It's been to long. It's not like I just started doing it yesterday, we're talking three years. That's a long time. That's why I'm saying that I can't do this without some help from those closest to me. I'm just scared to hurt them. I just hope they'll understand.<BR></P>"

"event","Ok so starting today or something I am actually going to try to keep updating this cause I haven't been doing such a great job. It's just hard because nothing new has been going on in my life.

It's been so freakin hot outside it's unbelievable and I can't take it. All I been doing is sleeping because there is nothing else to do and I'm to lazy to walk anywhere because it's to hot. This weekend I am going to my mom's house for my little sister's birthday party. I have to chaprone I guess so this is going to be a blast. I am going to take my friend Dezarae though so hopefully that will help pass some time. School's been done and thank god I don't have summer school. I only have to go back in August to retake an exam and thats it. So I was very much excited. I am stuck babysitting all day today and it kind of sucks because I am so out of it I can't stand myself. Oh well it will be a good paycheck then. Score! 

well that's it for now because I am having a mind blank as usual. So....BYE!

"event","Damn it feels like forever since I updated in here last. I don't even know what to say honestly. School's finally over which freakin rocks and hopefully I won't end up in summer school. I still haven't recieved a letter but there's always monday and that would be my luck to get it then. 

So tonight I got stuck babysitting and it kinda sucks because I haven't slept at all yet. I got about 4 hours last night at the most. I been sleepin all day and now i'm stuck here all night. Oh well. I have a graduation party tomorrow and I had to go to 2 graduations the other day which was a major drag. I can't wait to just get a day to myself and relax. haha I sound like my life is so hard. but I have been running like crazy it feels like and I want to just sit back and have a day all to myself. I also want to get out too. I haven't hung out with Stephanie in what seems like months and it sucks because we were always together and now like we barely talk at all. I don't want to lose her because of some stupid shit but I'm sure everything will be fine. Both of us have been so busy and now with her going away to camp and everything it's just crazy. Oh well her birthday is coming up and I have to find out what I am going to get her and what I'm going to do for her. Until then I'm just stuck here. So if anyone has any suggestions with what I could do with my life over the summer please leave me some comments!

"event","Hey!!! Oh man I had the best day EVER yesterday!!! So me and Josh, Mike and Tia are all going to the movies wednesday. I can't wait. Then Josh came and met me after my 7th period class and walked with me to my next class. I didn't know what to say. haha. Then....I went to the Goldfinger concert last night and it was FUCKING GREAT! I had so much fun! The opening bands were Black Maria and The Bottom Line. They rocked. I went and bought myself a t-shirt and while I was up there this guy started talking to me from behind the table just asking me how I was and how I liked the show so far. Well I was talking to him then realized it was the drummer for Goldfinger. I was like oh my god. haha I didn't even realize it. They laughed. Then the guitar player from Bottom line was talking to me and they gave me some free stuff and told me to come and hang out with the band after the show. I was like ok! haha I didn't though but it was such a great time. It was funny because Goldfinger brought everyone on stage and the people were running and jumping into the crowd to crwod surf but nobody was catching them. You'd see them run and jump and then just fall. It was a good time. It deff got the money worth. So then the drummer of Goldfinger came on and told us to rate from 1 to 10. So everyone was like oh god what is he going to do. Well he dropped his pants and was wearing a thong. It was probably the most disturbing thing I ever seen but it got some good rates and not to mention it kept falling off of him. The crowd went crazy when the band was playing. The whole floor was a huge mosh pit! Me and my dad were laughing. We were jumping all over the place and just going nuts. So now the morning after and I am still going crazy and talking funny cause I am still trying to get my voice back. But it was worth it. Me and my dad are thinking of going to the Chevelle concert coming up in May. So I am going to save up some money and go to that one too. WOO!!"

Friday I had my friend Cassie's birthday party and it was really fun. We went to the Hampton Inn and it was just alot of fun. ""CHARLIE....COME OUT COME OUT WHEREVER YOU ARE.."" and ""DID I GO ANYWHERE??"" me: ""NOPE!"" haha good times. And we fed a ho-bo that was across the street too! It was great we gave him some of our snacks and then bought him food at ALDI's. Then me and Steph went and got our belly buttons pierced. That was crazy. First thing out of my mouth..""HOLY SHIT! LOOK AT YOUR EARS!"" hehe. The girl that was there had a spike coming out of her forehead!! We were like how did you get that pierced? and her response was ""oh I got it surgically implanted."" I was like holy shit screw that! haha. Then Sunday came and it was MY birthday!! I had a few people over and we all just kind of hung out. It was fun and it was a nice day. So that's about it. Then Cameron's bday was yesterday and Veronica's is tomorrow. Then I got my sister's on the 15th and my brothers on the 22nd. I am going CRAZY! haha to many birthdays at once."

"event","So last night sucked big time. I got to Jessica's house and I met everyone which was cool because everyone was super sweet. Then Cameron came and everything seemed to go down hill from there. It just sucked. We really didn't exchange any words or anything all night. I don't think we even wanted to be in the same room. I kept getting up and leaving. Making excuses that I had to use the bathroom and stupid shit like that. Jessica's brother Joey hit Cameron in the face with a hacky sac it was really funny. That was like the only thing that really made me laugh all night. So then the limo came and picked us up and of course it was like snowing and all nasty outside. But the guys went to the front of the limo to talk and us girls went to the back and played with buttons and the phone and the radio until we got yelled at. It was fun. Then the guys decided that they wanted to play a game. BUt it included us girls taking our clothes off. haha. It was funny. Then we changed roles and made the guys do it. Of course nothing happened though. Mike and Ryan tried all night to get me and Cameron to kiss and well that didn't turn out to well. Just argument. Go figure. So while we were there it was so cold. We were outside maybe 5 minutes at the most and we were soaked! Our makeup was all running down our faces and shit it was really funny. Mike did more complaining while we were there than anyone else did. We were all like...damn we should have kept you home you crabass. It was funny. He didn't think so though. So Cameron did nothing but yell at me all night. It sucked I wanted to go home so freakin bad. Everything I did it was either...Jesus Christ or what the fuck! I was like OH MY GOD! haha. yea it sucked. Then on the ride home I just isolated myself from everyone at the back of the limo and wouldn't talk to anyone. I was so pissed off. Jess was a little upset because she knew I wasn't really having a good time. But I told her it was ok. So we turned all the lights off in the limo and everyone just like layed down and fell asleep. It was a long ride. Cameron ended up coming to the back with me and sitting with me and then he yelled cause I didn't know what I wanted to listen to. Everyone found it shocking cause I wouldn't talk the whole time and then when he yelled at me again in the limo I bitched right back at him. I was fed up. I was like ""ARE YOU DONE?! I'M SICK OF THIS! YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT FUCKING BITCHED AT ME THE WHOLE FUCKING TIME AND I'M NOT LISTENING TO IT THE WHOLE FUCKING RIDE HOME TOO. SO MAKE UP YOUR MIND OR SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE!"" Yea everyone was speechless but the look on his face was pricless I couldn't help but laugh. But then he seen I was serious and stopped yelling at me. It was cool though because Cameron payed for all my stuff and everything. The ride home was so cold I was like shaking because all my stuff was soaked. I looked like a wet dog. haha. And Cameron gave me his jacket so I wouldn't be cold. It was kind of cute. Then we just layed there and he sang to me and it was cute. But that was about it. That was like the only good thing about last night. Besides that HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESS! haha."

I am going to Canada tomorrow and I don't really think it is going to be all that great. Cause one: it's supposed to be really shitty out tomorrow Two: Cameron is going to be there and I have a bad feeling about that cause with the crap going on. It's going to be all couples and..me. I hate when that happens. Anyone wanna be my date?! haha. 

I decided I am sick of being really preppy. I miss my old self....yes my old self. So I decided I am going to slowly go back to that. But not totally. It's complicated to explain. Whatever. So yea awesome.

Vacation's almost over bitches, this sucks. But I can't really complain cause it has been fun. Most of it at least. I hung out with some old friends yesterday which was fun. They came and kidnapped me from my house I was excited. haha. I went to my friend John's house because they were having band practice. They sounded real good too for not having the whole band there. They were trying to show me and Jami how to play guitar but it wasn't working to well. I was confused. Go figure. Yea, John is really hot. haha and I kind of told him that by accident yesterday. But it was really funny. Guess you had to be there. 

Stephanie and I got so bored on Tuesday that we walked to the mall. We had alot of fun though. We have some good pictures too, haha. We went in this one store and I put on all this crazy stuff and we were taking pictures and the lady was about to yell at us and I just kind of came out with...""umm I really like this jacket!!"" Then she just gave us a look and walked away. haha. It was so freakin funny. Then we went into this prom dress store and put on the biggest puffiest dresses we could find and we put them on and took pictures. We had the lady takin pictures for us and they were laughing. I found these awesome glasses too! They were more like goggles and they were so cool! I looked like a bug! haha! Good times. 

Well I'm out. Bye!"

"event","Yesterday had to have been the WORST day possible. I talked to Cameron yesterday and he just told me straight out that he doesn't want to go out with me. He said he wasn't feeling a ""spark"" with us. I'm am so freaking glad that he waited 2 MONTHS to tell me this. Ugh it just sucks so bad. I kept telling Stephanie and Justin and everyone that I was getting sick of him because he wasn't asking me out or anything and I was just getting annoyed with him. But I never thought it would hurt this much when he actually told me. I never cried like that for someone either. I don't know, it just hit me hard I guess. I can't even eat because I feel so sick to my stomach. And on top of it I am going to Canada with him this Saturday. So that is not going to go to good either. I would feel bad if I told Jessica that I wasn't going because this is part of her birthday. So I am gonna go for her but I don't know how long I'll last till I go crazy. we'll have to see. 5 months...that's all I can think of. I just wasted 5 months of my life on nothing. And a few let downs from people I ACTUALLY LIKE ASKING ME OUT. Everything is just so messed up. This vacation kind of sucks big time. I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong. Every guy seems to do the same thing to me. Well I'm going...I think I'm going to be sick."

"event","So the first few days of vacation so far have been great. I spent it with my best friend and well a few others. So I don't think this vacation is going to suck afterall. Steph had me running on Friday and then we walked for 2 days straight. I can't even move I'm so sore. haha. Goes to show how out of shape I am. Last night we caught up with Riy, Chris, and Jaime (yes, timon boys) and we just walked around all afternoon (I think we should have just stayed home Steph!) haha. We had fun though and it was great to see Steph beat the shit out of Riy. haha! Oh well he deserved it. We went to Nick's and then decided that we weren't hungry so we just got up and walked out. The face on the girl that was waiting on us when we just walked out was priceless. Good times. Chris got punched in the face by a 10 year old and he was bleeding all over! It was really funny. ""I highly advise you not to come to my house if you want to live to see tomorrow cause me dad..well he's crazy and he will shoot you in the head.."" And go figure Steph they came anyways. haha. Idiots! Oh talking about that, the guy that lives on the corner of my street shot himself in the head on Thursday. Sucks to be him!
  
So today is Easter! YAY! I am so excited and I can't wait to go to my grandmas house and eat. mmm food....haha. On holidays I never eat anything until we get to my grandmas house cause that's where the best food is. wow I'm a pig, oh well. So HAPPY EASTER EVERYONE!!"

We played cards and darts all night and listened to rap. haha steph! only we didn't have disney movies!!! HAHA!! So we go to sit down to play cards and I sat in the chair and it broke!! It was soo freakin funny. Then after we went and played some darts and I don't know how it happened but I ended up giving my sisters boyfriend a lap dance...yea..not to mention I like fell over while going to do it. So Lu went and got the bed together and when me and steph went to go to bed the bed collapsed!! I was like oh my god..welcome to the West Side! And as LuAnthony would say...""Hey now....."" haha I can't even write this without laughing! Well let's just say it was a crazy night and I can't think of anything else.

I didn't even get out on the runway and I had people asking me where I got my outfit and stuff. And they bought it! I was like wow that is so cool. When I was walking down this lady said I had a good figure for my outfit. I was so happy. My mom came but of course she was late and missed it. I was like whatever. She had nothing good to say anyways. She just walked in and then walked out. I was like wow what a bitch. haha. So now I am in such a good mood I can't wait until the next one. My step mom she is going to do it with me next time. I was like OH MAN! hehe. well that's all for now! Bye!"

"event","So today we had a competition for orchestra at Southside. One....it was so boring and we weren't on until around the end so it took FOREVER! Then....it was our turn. Well we didnt do so great. Jeff had to play a smaller bass which was like not so good, the piano was out of tune, and we all rushed so much that we couldn't even keep up with ourselves! I was so mad. But I mean hey there's always another time. We didn't even get really any time to practice the music. I mean Mr. Whitney gave us the music maybe a month ago not even. It wasn't enough time. But oh well. I mean Jeff and I were talking during the performances and we kind of had a feeling we weren't going to compare with City Honors or anything. They sounded really good. I have to admit. And then to top it off I only made it to two classes today but they were Mrs. Delbel and Mr. Slaght, I was like wow go figure. So now I am stuck here babysitting all night till around 11. I just can't wait to get home and put some comfy clothes on and bond with my pillow. That sounds great."

I have a audition tomorrow for school and I am kind of excited. But....we sound horrible! I have this part I have to play and I can't get the third position fast enough with the song. It's sounds really bad. Then again I probably should be practicing for that right now. But there's no point cause we sound like ass anyways. haha. 

Only a week or so left of school and then Spring Break!! I can't wait. I can use the break cause school sucks. I can't wait until it's over. 

This weekend is going to be amazing though. I am so pumped. I got that Fashion show on saturday and I just can't wait. haha. It's actually not even like a big deal but it'll be fun. 

ok so I am now drawing a blank. My life is quite boring actually so it's hard to write stuff in here about exciting events. hehe oh man I'm such a nerd!

I can't do it. I decided, I can't do it. I thought I was stronger. I was wrong. I need it. I need it. Blood, it's the only way. The only way for me to...die? No I don't want death. I just want out. But it seems my door is locked. I'm stuck. I'm stuck in this hell. Also known as my life. I've gotton to far. To far for anyone to help me now. It's just to late. I look in the mirror and what I see is...this poor girl. Sad, depressed, broken. I look away cause sometimes, all the time, I hate my own reflection. Her eyes, if only you could see the pain behind her eyes. Everyday I pray. I pray my life was just a dream. A dream I can't wake up from. I feel confused. I feel like life is playing a big joke on me. The girl in the mirror spoke to me. She spoke to me and said ""Excuse me, but can I be you for awhile?"" I looked away. Looked away as she called me, as she faded to black. I fear I am ordinary, just like everyone, to lie here and die among the stars, adrift among the days. I don't think there was ever a place for someone like me to be totally happy. I end up on the floor, hands wrapped around my stomach, head bowed. I can feel the warm tears on my cheeks. I open my eyes only to realize, I am still here. Oh but how I wish I wasn't. I have this voice inside my head, and it keeps telling me this world isn't meant for me. And as I look at my wrists a bloody mess, I begin to realize it's true.

So for some reason I got real down about some stuff yesterday. And I got bored in fifth period. I hate it cause I get in these moods and most of the time I don't know why. But that's why I write stuff like you just read cause I feel it helps me from actually doing it. I don't know, one of these days I'll understand...someday."

School still really sucks and I can't believe how fast it is going. I really need to start to get my grades up or I might be stuck here again. It just sucks. Cameron..well he's just amazing as always. He took me to a movie and then to eat last monday which was a blast. but umm ya.
  This month is black history month and I never really thought anything of it at my old school cause like there were no black kids. But in my school yea they really get into it. I can't stand anyone in this school anymore. I hate it I am going to see if I can get my mom to maybe let me use her address so that I can go back to West Seneca. I would do anything right now to get out of this school. People just don't understand. I am really not going to pass this year either I know it. I don't know what my problem is though I did great in my old school. I think it's just the fact that I hate it here and I just don't want to do it.
   But anyways I'll stop with the complaining cause my life isn't so bad. haha. My sister is moving out to the West Side today. I can't believe she is going to raise a kid out there but whatever. I can't wait till the baby's here! Did I mention that it is a boy? everytime I go shopping I always end up looking in the baby section and the clothes. haha. Oh I'm such a dork.
   I went to the mall Wednesday I believe it was and we had so much fun! I was so hyper and I was just acting like an ass. I ran through the mall hiding behind poles pretending I had a gun and humming the mission impossible tune. It was so much fun. Then I was playing red light green light with people. It was really funny. I guess you had to be there. Cause it was so funny.

We got in trouble cause we were all in the cafeteria and they had these m&m's on the tables. So I kept throwing them at my friend Amanda and she got mad and threw the whole dish at me. It was great until we got warned that they'd kick us out of the dance. Woops! Great times. I miss that school, cause we used to get in so much trouble there and the great part is that I don't even go there and all the teachers still yell at me! haha. My bad!

Then my step mom came home and flipped out at me cause my sister went and was talking shit with someone at my moms work. So I almost got kicked out of the house yesterday. And I had to babysit for my cousin last night which I didn't get home until around 1 and then I had to babysit this morning. I am beat. But the cool thing about yesterday was Shannon Speaker from the Edge came and picked me up from my house last night and that was freakin awesome! She was laughin cause I was like ""OMG you're Shannon Speaker from the Edge! That is so cool!"" and then they all laughed. She was like ""It was nice to meet you!"" And I said ""Yea same here cause now I have an awesome story to tell me friends tomorrow!"" It was funny I guess you had to be there.

So tonight is my big dance and I am so excited! And everything feels so less stressful now that everything is figured out and situated. I went to Cameron's house on Thursday to do a little ""Meet the Parents"" and that was interesting! Not to mention I looked like ass cause I was on my way to dance. But they didn't seem to mind. I have this feeling that something big ois going to happen tonight and it isn't going to be good. So now I can't wait!

I didn't go to school today again. I went to the dentist and I have a cavity...eww. I also had a mid term today for global but whatever. He said that he'll let me take it tomorrow. So lt's hope.

I watched The Grudge last night and I'll admit that I jumped a few times but it was really stupid, plot wise. I had to watch it twice cause I had no idea what the hell happened! haha.

School is going really slow it feels like. Or maybe it's just this week. This girl Selena got all pissy face and whatnot on Monday. She tried to hit me but it didn't work as she planned. Man I hate girls...I really do.

My friend Sara had a date yesterday so I helped her get herself together for that. She was so nervous she threw up everywhere. It was really gross, but I thought I would at least help her out and hold her hair. It was kind of funny. The last thing out of her mouth when he showed up at the door was.....""Do you have a mint?"" and then she started crying. I felt bad. haha. I am going out with Cameron tonight I am so excited. I hope I don't do what Sara did! haha, oh man that was really funny I'm sorry.

So I didn't go to school today but it's all good. I hate when you are up and ready to leave and then your parents say that you don't have to go. I could of went back to bed but that's ok. So I let my brother stay home with me. We swarmed ourselves with blankets, made hot chocolate, and watched movies. It was fun cause I'm a cool sister as he would say. He's to cute. 

Oh did I mention that I was ""vision"" on Saturday?? Ha! I let Emily give me a makeover. Big mistake!! She had this bright blue eyeshadow on me and my lips were like a blood red. It was nuts. Then!....she decided to paint my nails. I swear it was everywhere but on my nails. She did my hair in pigtails and they were mostly knots in the rubberbands. I looked like the babysitter from hell! I couldn't get it off either. But it was cute because then Johnny came up to me and gave me a big hug and said ""Wow, you look beautiful."" It was adorable.

I got a manicure yesterday. It was amazing! Truly amazing! I also went to the dance thing at our school on Saturday and it was really good. I am glad that I went. These girls started hasseling Steph and I because we are white. Steph was all scared, she was like ""I don't understand how you can come here everyday!"" it was funny. Did I ever mention how much I hate the girls in my school?

Last night was amazing! I went to Stephanie's basketball game and we had so much fun. I hung out with a bunch of my old friends that I haven't seen since last year. Bad thing though. I caught up with a jerk that I haven't seen and didn't want to see yesterday....yes Lamare. When I seen him I just got up and left because we don''t need to go back to what used to happen. I was tempted to just go up and beat the fuck out of him like I always wanted. Show him how it feels, asshole. Then afterwards we all went out to Tim Hortons and just hung out. I miss that school so fucking much I wish I could go back there. 

Today I have to go help my friend Dezerae move her shit out of her house. Sounds like a blast! Maybe I just won't show, you think she'll be mad?? Tomorrow Steph and I decided to go ice skating and I can't wait! I have to go tonight though too for my brother. 

School yesterday was so boring and slow. I had this sub however that talked like Marvin the Martion, however you spell it, and it was amazing. Besides that it sucked. GOt into another argument with Mr. Whitney. God do I hate him. Always getting in my business. It just annoys me.

We had these really cute costumes all picked out but there was this girl that was rather ""large"" and in order to fit into an x-large she had to lose weight. So we had to pick these really ugly ones cause they were the only one with her size. Well go figure after we order them she dropped out of dance! I'm pissed. So now I am stuck payin $70 for a really ugly costume. Pfft...people these days!

So I got news on Alex. They said he is going to be in the hospital for a few months. Which sucks. And I just found out that my friend Aaron has to go in for surgery because when he got a concusion they found a brain tumer. So I am hoping for the best here."

"event","I had such a crazy day. I have so much energy now too. My sister came over today and we hung out for a bit. Mad fun. 

So....last night my friend Matt called me and he got jumped, robbed, and held at gun point. Crazy. That would really suck.....oh wait it happened to me a few times already I forgot! haha. 

I think I am doing pretty good so far with my whole trying to be happy. I haven't complained in like a minute and yeah. Bad news however, Veronica is leaving me in a few weeks. That really sucks. It will be back to me myself and I once again. Oh well. Shit happens. I am trying to get my grades up and it seems like it is absolutly impossible!! I have been doing everything I can and it seems like nothing's working. Oh well back to summer school for me.

"event","Is it just me or does it seem like this week is going by so slow?? I can barely stay awake in school anymore. But I think I am actually going to try so I can please my parents. Today for the first time this year I did homework for Mr. Healy, he was shocked!

They are calling for a huge snow storm! Yeah! Hopefully we will get a snowday. I just can't even stand to be in school anymore. Veronica is now leaving me which sucks but that's just another page in my life. So it's cool. For New Years I decided that a good New year resolution for me is to be happy for once. I decided that I might as well deal with everything because nothing is going to change anytime soon. Plus all my solutions for getting out of this place aren't working because......well, I'm obviously still here. Great.

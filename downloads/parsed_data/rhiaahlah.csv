Well... tomorrow is my big last day of working for the state.  I've spent all day tying up the loose ends... finishing the transcribing process on the surveys for this month, cleaning out the car, freaking that I've forgotten something huge.

It's going to be weird to not have a job... I mean... I had a lot of free time with this job, but I was always forgetting something.  There has been a feeling in the back of my mind for the last 6 months that I've got something due... or something I'm forgetting.  It's actually a hell of a lot like college... weird, eh?  Unfortunatley, that feeling was usually right... I usually was forgetting something.  I don't even know how many times I forgot to fill out my time sheet, or my mileage trip ticket, or lost my keys, or missed the thousands of phone calls my two supervisors flung at me.  Argh.  Sometimes I felt like I was the worst employee ev4r, but after talking with a lot of people about my woes... it seems like everyone feels that way.  It's going to be nice to just relax... and clean the house top to bottom, heh.  

The upside, however, is that I'm going to get to collect unemployment for the first time!  :)  Wooo free money!"

"event","Urgh.  Just got home from a marathon of days at my Mom's house (right after working out of town for three days).  I went down and picked fruit Sunday, Mom had surgery Monday and I've been helping her around the house/farm ever since becaue Dad was out of town.  Thankfully he got home late last night so I get this partial day at home to prepare for another work week.  This week I'll be doing a string of 5 ten hour days because I'm saving up comp time for the Autumn War SCA event.  

Lots of driving ahead of me:
8/30/07 Central Puget Sound - Everett Marine Area 8-A
8/31/07 Columbia River - Mouth of the Cowlitz River  
9/1/07 Mayfield/Riffe Lakes    
9/2/07 South Puget Sound - Point Defiance Launch 
9/3/07 Lake Washington - Gene Coulon Launch

It's good to be home... I'm not sneezing every 4 seconds from the insane cat hair and dust that seems to cover every surface in my Mom's house.  Gah.  I didn't know I was going to be down there so long... so I didn't have enough clothes to last me so many days.  :(  I feel gross even with the showers.  /cleanme

My tattoo is almost completely healed, but it's at that itchy annoying phase... I'm also really tired of lotioning my freaking chest every hour.  < W2Bhealingz20g >
Well... I guess I'm off to organize clothes for my exciting worky fish week and dig out garb and camping junk for Autumn War (w00t w00t)."

The tattoo is healing up fast... linework > fill in for healing factor.  Linework hurts a hell of a lot more, though, so it's a tradeoff.

Our blueberry port is bubbling away in its brewing bucket and the beer (I have no idea what kind) that the guys made has finally started to pop the airlock... even with a little nervousness about the yeast treatment.  Whee!

Ermmm.... not too much going on with me really.  I get back home on Sunday and I'll take the rest of the day for lazing about and getting laundry done.  Monday I'm meeting my Mom and Aunt in Olympia for another of Mom's skin cancer prevention/control surgeries.  Small one this time... in theory.  >_>  Luckily it's only abnormal cells, not full blown malignant melanoma like the one a couple years ago.  Meh.  Curse my genes.  /fistshake

My kitten has sunburned herself in the windowsill and is now all peely.  It's icky.  But of course she's scratching the hell out of herself now... so I need to find some sort of moisturing sunblock that's safe for kitties/babies to eat and be slathered in.  Any moms out there that know some secrets?

I watched <a href=""http://www.beowulfandgrendel.com/""><i>Beowulf and Grendel</i></a>... which is a state co-sponsored Ontario-Norway film.  It's held up in box offices in Canada really well... so I'm not just biased on the account of the male lead being a sexy beast (Beowulf... not Grendel).  I recommend it for the awesome garb and armour and the cute little Nordic ponies.  Also watched <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428134/""><i>The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant</i></a> which was beautiful and sad and awesome.  It's sad... and she's extremely used, but it's really an awesome story about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Bryant"">a real life person</a>... with embellishments and blending, of course.  (Shhh I still liked it)

"event","So... I just returned to Tacoma after a looong worky week.  
On Thursday I went to Vantage (it's a tiny little dust town on I-90 past Ellensburg and before the Gorge) and got some work done. 

Friday morning I headed out on what turned into a beautiful car trip to White Pass.  I stopped at fruit stands and collected various tasty things... and it was really nice weather so going up the back side of the pass was amazing.
When I got to the summit I checked into the White Pass Village Inn... which is very cute and ski-lodgy. I had a studio unit to myself with two beds and kitchenette and foreplace and whatnot.  

After I went to Rimrock Lake to get a water sample and harrass some boaters, I met up with my Mom at the Leech Lake horse camp (which is about 2 minutes from the inn) and we went riding up the Pacific Crest Trail to the first little alpine stopping spot called Deer Lake.  We've camped at that horse camp and gone up that trail several times now on different trips, and I've always loved it.  We hadn't been back in probably more than 5 years due to college and money and time... but my mom just jumped at the chance to meet me up there.  Dad showed up much later with their big ass Sprinter van that they use as an RV.

Saturday morning I went around to the smaller local lakes: Clear Lake, Dog Lake, Leech Lake, Bumping Lake, etc.  I didn't find much action for surveys, but at least I tried.  Turns out my housemate Greg had been mandatoried for a double shift the night before, which means he takes the next day off, so I invited him and Jon up to Whiute Pass for some adventure.

When Greg and Jon got there we went over to the horse camp and hung out for awhile... played some music, cooked up chicken sausage dogs and smores!  Whee!
In the morning Jon and I fell out of bed all stiff and lame and went to the little local store (okay, the only local store) and had fresh bagel sandwiches made for all of us.  w00t.  So tasty.  I made them have a big breakfast because they were going to go hiking up the mountain... and they're just not used to that sort of thing.

We met my parents at their camp and headed up the trail (Pacific Crest #2000 for anyone that cares) at about 11am.  The first mile is nothing but switchbacks and pain... where we almost lost Jon, but they both stuck to it and made it up the 1,000 foot rise to victory.  After that first horror show, the trail generally evens out... with random bits of climbing, but nothing to rival the switchbacks of the first mile.  Mom and I were riding, Mom bareback because her horsey had gotten a saddle sore and me riding a new horse that I'd never met... and packing huge bags full of all of our stuff.  Dad, Jon and Greg were all hiking... but Dad hikes a lot so he charged ahead with his binoculars to shout some elk.  I think the trail is beautiful... insanely rugged and harsh, but the trees are HUGE and there are amazing little lush meadows and rocky ledges that appear out of the dust.  There is light green moss hanging from every surface, eventhough it's really dry up there. 

We finally made it to the top three miles later... 5,200 feet... and had lunch at Deer Lake.  Yay!  One time my parents and I stayed up on that trail for 6 or 7 days and spent a couple nights at Deer Lake before moving on to Beosh Lake (I think that's how it's spelled) which is about another 10 miles.  We didn't continue on to Sand Lake because the guys were tired (well, not my Dad... who went marching off to Sand Lake and a random offshoot trail and back to scout before lunch) and it was getting colder.  You'd be surprised how freakin' cold it is in August when you're up that high... there wasn't any snow, but it was nippy.

Anyway... we all piled into our seperate cars (I had my state car) and trundled back to Tacoma last night.  We were going to watch <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>, but we were just too tired.  I assume we'll watch it today, but who knows.

I know this post is long... but I don't care.  If I cut it no one will read it.  >_>"

In a half hour comes the best part... punching and rolling.  I love it.  Then I'm going to seperate my massive bread heap into little squares and fill them with left over lamb and turkey korma.  After another 15 minutes or so to rise with their fillings they go into the oven until they're the right color and smell (I don't do the timer thing for the end product).

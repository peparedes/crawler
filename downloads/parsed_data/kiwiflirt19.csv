  i have crush on someoneelse tho but as well as the one im in love with he doesnt want me either... im sick of flirting in hoping that maybe something will happen...i understand im not ur type and that okay.... but its not happening he is in my grasp but he doesnt want me... a senior and a sophmore...hmmmm i think he knows who he is.... and if u do pretend  when u talk to me that i never wrote this....because i just neede to get it of my chest.

  im starting to believe that im gunna die alone...and that scares me....

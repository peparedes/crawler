"event","Haven't been here for a while. Every time I say I'm going to post more, I end up ignoring this journal for months. Ah well...I guess LJ has just lost its appeal.

Though I probably should use it more, as I need somewhere to rant.

<lj-cut text=""Cue TL;DR"">So I started working for Laurent's dad again. Yes, that company that drove me to tears and near mental breakdowns - that very one. And here I am, again, wondering wtf compelled me to come back.

Probably that $3 raise. And the benefits. And some stability. Gamestop was fun and all, but it was not going anywhere. After Christmas they were probably going to get rid of me anyway.

I've been here since mid-December. I thought it would be different - new accounting software, less technicians to run around after, an actual accountant. After a month of being here, I already wanted to quit. But I stuck it out because I needed the money and health insurance.

There comes a time, however, when the money and benefits just don't quite justify staying at a job. Laurent's dad is the same as last time, if not worse. Nothing is ever done right, it seems. And they split the company up for tax reasons. So now instead of doing work for just one, I do work in both, and since the parts manager (well, former manager. He quit, thank god) had no idea what he was doing, I was doing the work of about 3 people. While getting yelled at. Constantly.

But, because I'm incredibly stupid, I stuck it out. Again. I come here every day only to have to fix the owner's fuck ups, placate customers the owner has managed to piss off, and chase after everyone here for them to do their job. I'm not expecting a thanks or some reward. All I'd like is to be talked to like I'm a person and not a toddler. Maybe be able to take a lunch every once in a while (or at least be able to mark that overtime on my payroll...heh, right). Hell, even if I wanted to, I couldn't take a vacation because *no one* else here can do my job.

This is where it gets interesting, however. I've always said that if the service manager, Dave, quits, I'll be gone with him. I literally cannot sit here in the office all day with Jack (Laurent's dad).

Yesterday night, Dave put in his two weeks notice, which completely caught me by surprise. I guess he couldn't take the bullshit either. I don't blame him. I know I said if he left, I'd leave, too, but if I did leave, that would really fuck things up here. They'd lose two employees at once (two that are the only people that can do what they do), and since Jack is here on a visa (through his business, I'm not exactly sure how it works) through his company, he needs to keep a certain number of employees. If I leave, that leaves him one employee short to stay here.

In short: I probably won't quit, as I'm being guilted into staying. If I leave, I'll be the horrible, bitch girlfriend that fucked it all up. Laurent hasn't said anything. In fact, he's actually said he'd understand if I left. I just get this really strong feeling that there would be a lot of resentment if I did. So I'll stay, come home in tears nearly once a week over the sheer stupidity and stress of working here, just so I don't let everyone down.

Still...I think I'm going to look around for other work, just incase I break down and quit...which is likely to happen sometime soon. Even if I take a cut in pay, it'll be worth it.

This? This is why I will NEVER work for family again.</lj-cut>

In other happier news, I finally went and bought myself a new laptop. I put my tax refund, plus a bit more, into a very nice laptop that'll last me a while. And it'll actually run games without lag! I can finally play Sims 3...which I bought 4 months ago and that ended up killing my old laptop. >.>

Plus now I can get Dragon Age and the expansion pack as well. And aaaaaall the DLC I want. :D Was looking at Mass Effect, too, but I'm not too sure I want a shooter, as I suck horribly at them on the 360. Maybe the controls will be easier on the computer.

But, yes, laptop is on its way in today. I am so excited. lol I kinda want to skip the gym today and just mess around with it. :P"

"event","I've decided to try and keep this thing updated now, at least for a while. I seem to get really into LJ for a bit, and then I just sort of disappear. Well, not really, as I still come here daily to browse the communities I'm in. I just don't post or keep up with my friends list as much as I'd like to.

That and nothing really important has happened that's worth posting about. :P

I'm back working for Laurent's dad (again). Yes, I know I'm stupid for going back, but they gave me a raise that was more than double what I was making at Gamestop. Yes, I worked there for a span of about two months before I gave up. Manager was an anal retentive, OCD, perfectionist bastard that treated us like crap (for the most part; he had his good days). I probably should have taken a bigger advantage of my employee discount, but oh well. :P

So I quit there and started back at Nauti-Tech near the end of December...and it's just as fun as it was when I quit. Except there are only 4 full time technicians there (down from the 11 or 10 that were working there before I quit). The yachting industry sucks right now, and we're lucky if we can land a few really big jobs now and again (ones over $50,000). 

Sometimes I feel like quitting again, but I saw what it's like out there, trying to get a job when <b>nothing</b> is available. I might loathe it but at least I'm making a pretty decent income. The only thing that really convinced me to come back was the fact I went from $7.50 per hour to $15.00 per hour...$3.00 more than what I made last time I was there. Plus benefits...yay benefits! Don't have to worry about getting sick anymore. 

So...yes, hopefully I'll be updating some more. I know I'm going to make an entry about some odd stuff that's happened to me and my family, but I'll do that tomorrow. When it's not dark. And I'm not alone. lol"

"event","So the journal is going to stay. I couldn't find a better name, and the one I really wanted was taken...both forms I came up with. Besides, I've had this journal since high school...I can't just delete it.

Instead I've started over completely. Cleaned up a bunch of the communities I was in, removed some friends that were no longer there. Deleted all of the WoW ones first. Now I won't have wow_ladies clogging up my friends page.

Left the game a month ago. I was starting to get too involved in it. Plus there was no way I could raid, and it takes so much time now to do *anything* that it feels like a chore to play it. So I left and I feel SO much better.

I even actually started going to the gym everyday. Up at 8 and there by 8:30, stay for an hour, then come home. It's really refreshing and I have tons more energy. I even lost 10 pounds since I started, so I'm thrilled. :)

Starting school again in the Spring semester. Going to finish up my AA (only three credits left to finish), and from there I'm going to look into cooking/baking classes. I can't decide between going into pastry or becoming a chef. I love both types of cooking, so I'll have to decide at some point.

I'm also starting back up photography again. Nothing really going on with drawing/painting, but I'm hoping that taking photos might help get the creativity flowing again. I should really start using my DA account again...

So, since I've had so much time on my hands, I started working for an in-game goal of mine I've wanted since I saw it first come out: the Ambassador title. It was put to the side while I focused on getting Metaphor leveled, but I hit a leveling slump around 73, so I decided to just buckle down and get it out of the way.

It HURT. lol

So much grinding...so many quests...so much gold spent on runecloth (especially for the gnomes...I now hate them more because of this. >.>), but I did it. Took me about two solid weeks of questing and grinding cloth, but I think it was well worth it. :D

Plus it'll help me along on my way to that albino drake. ;)

Poor Ix...she is not amused. Someone placed bunny ears on her while I was AFK, and this is what I came back to. lol. She looks so offended.

She's got a bit of an attitude. lol. I decided to have her take up engineering and mining...something I'm regretting now. It's sooo expensive. D: And it takes forever to level...and it's expensive (did I mention that?). :( So she may drop it for skinning for the crit bonus (and extra gold)...but the goggles. I like the goggles. :( Ah well, maybe when she hits 80 she can take it back up. :P

So! Last weekend was the end of Noblegarden. Friday I decided that I was going to buckle down and just finish the bloody thing as I had quite a few of the achievements. So I spent forever running around opening eggs...and I found 3 of the pet, 2 spring bouquets, the elegant dress, the bunny ears, and the tux set. Ported to Shatt and tried to do the bunny ear achievment. Managed to nab the undead female, orc female, and belf female easily (first time I had mistaken a male for a female...oops. D:). Then I begged and pleaded for a port to Dalaran...which didn't happen until Saturday.

That desert rose achievement was a pita. D: Metaphor seems to enjoy the bunny ears more than Ix, by the way. lol


Saturday I woke up early (as it was the last day for the event and I was sooooo close), got my port to Dalaran, and spent literally an hour waiting for a female troll and Tauren, which didn't show up. :( So I decided to get Hard Boiled out of the way (freakin' ran from CoT aaaaaall the way to Un'Goro) as well as Blushing Bride. Long story short (and I mean LONG...took me 4 hours to do it all. D:), I got the Tauren and Troll as they ran by, then ran to Karanos for the last bunny achievement I needed. 

End result?

And then I rolled on Hellscream and made a paladin:

But it wasn't Horde.

There's Metaphor at 18, kinda sorta matching. It was the earliest ss I got of her.

Then she leveled and did an awesome quest and had her name yelled throughout the zone...it was pretty cool. :D

She even got a neat tabbard to cover up her armor (or lack thereof) in the near future:

Yeah, no longer in that guild. They seemed to think rape jokes were funny. >.>

Moving along...her first mount! :D

I got artistic. :P

And then this, because I've *never* had this happen and it was really, really strange:

<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_041209_115511.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_041209_115511.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Logged in...there was no ground. D:

So the NPCs and I fell...and fell. And fell some more. Until...everything disappeared. It asked me if I wanted to release my spirit, and I did.


<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_041209_115532.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_041209_115532.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
This is where I ended up...Menethil Harbor...across the freakin' ocean from where I was. And guess what? There was no ground there either! So my spirit just fell...then disappeared...then spawened at the spirit healer again..then fell. Wash, rinse, and repeat for about 5 minutes while I was freaking out. Couldn't hearth, couldn't log out, couldn't exit game...nothing. So I alt+F4 to exit and was back on solid groud...in Theramore...with my body out in the middle of the ocean.

No idea how this happened. O.o

Anyway, here she is now, looking pretty badass. :D

I might reactivate my first account...even though I can't play on both at once. :/ Or not...I'll wait a while more and see what happens. I just feel like I'm missing out on so much now that 3.1 is out and my druid is just sitting at 80, untalented, and without her dualspecs. :(
</lj-cut>

Lolo's running Limewire again on his laptop, so that means free music for me. :D Been fixated on a lot of indie recently, so I went out and downloaded a few bands I haven't heard of. Managed to get Vampire Weekend again, after losing my CD. :/ Pretty sure Lolo has it, even though he denies it. Also got a Black Key's CD and The Wombats.

I've been working on that little art journal I mentioned a while back. I found a box of 32 (!) colored pencils at Lolo's house which I <strike>stole</strike>borrowed. They look so pretty against the black inking pen I use to draw. :3 I may post pictures as soon as I finish something. lol

Oh! I almost forgot to mention...Lolo was talking to Alex a week ago and he almsot has the cafe portion of his shop up and running...and he's really interested in what I have to make. :D Turns out the guys put in a really good word for me about my food, and he wants to set up a time in the near future for a tasting. I hope this happens, as I think it would be a great launching point for what I want to do eventually (customer ordered cakes/cupcakes).

Lolo's birthday is on the 24th...he's turning 21 and we're taking him out for a few drinks and dinner. I have no idea what to get him, though. D: I will be making him a cake...er, well, pie. He wants a home made cherry pie, which I can do. Never made a pie, but it can't be that hard, right? 

My sister's birthday is also this month on the 30th. She wants a butterfly cake and asked me to do it for her. I'm thinking about doing a two-tiered cake...maybe pastel colored with fondant/gumpaste/chocolate butterflies. I'm going to try my hand at making my own fondant so that it's actually edible. -_- I'll be making a rough sketch of it sometime next week, so I'll be sure to post it here. :)"

And an updated shot of my druid. She's got two pieces of T7 now, and is starting to kind of match. She also got her fist title (which you might be able to see in the above shots): she's now Eikcaj the Explorer, soon to be Eikcaj, Guardian of Cenarius...when I get the time. :P

First off:


<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_020809_192007.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_020809_192007.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>


My druid hit 80 a couple of weeks ago. They grow up so fast... :P


<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_020909_162545.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_020909_162545.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Old screen shot of her as a fresh 80...still wearing those level 70 gloves. >.> She's better now, I promise! :P

See? Her first piece of tier gear ever: her T7 chest piece. The new guild I'm in decided to take me along on their 10 man Naxx run. I think I spent more time dead on the floor than being of any real use....besides the occasional innervate or battle rez. Did get a couple of really nice healing upgrades, so when patch 3.1 comes out, I'll be ready to go resto/feral.

I've been pretty much running Heroics and dailies nonstop since hitting 80. I'm a poor, poor druid now. LWing is such a bitch to level.

Anyway, a few more random shots:

Halls of Lightning is such a pretty instance. Good thing I was just in there as a DPS(lol)...I think I spent more time looking at the graphics than really paying attention.

We 7-manned ZA just for the hell of it.

So what exactly do you do when you're 80?

Take a bunch of screenshots of yourself on mounts, apparently.

Or work on an alt:

See her? That's my next 80. :P

Even though my warlock:

<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_020309_170825.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_020309_170825.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

And my hunter:

Are both level 70 1/2...I go straight for my little 36 priest (who is now 47). I swear, sometimes my brain makes sense.

Lolo's already got two 80's to my one. That'll be fixed soon enough. We've been spending a lot of time with our new guildmates running Heroics and whatnot. They're a really good group of people who actually realize that it's a game and not a job. Can't make it to a raid? No problem! Need to leave early? That's fine! They're just an awesome group of people. :3</lj-cut>"

It's been a really hectic couple of weeks lately, as I would have posted earlier. Anyway, here are a few SS from the past couple of weeks.

First off, I'd like to show off my newest alt, a little Tauren Warrior named Neka. She will be my first real attempt at horde, even though she isn't getting much play time lately.

<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_012309_224457.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_012309_224457.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

I've never really cared for the warrior class, but for whatever reason, she's just a blast to play. If it wasn't for the consistent griefing by a few Alliance players, I'm sure she would have made it to level 10 this weekend, but level 9 is good enough. :)

Now to my druid - she hit 75 last weekend, and has been making the slow and painful grind to level 76. She's still a tank (and a pretty damn good one, too), and she'll most likely stay a tank due to the fact there are NO tanks on. Ever.

<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_010909_221115.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_010909_221115.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
I've since replaced the shoulders, but I'm still running around in level 70 blue tanking pieces. WTB upgrades, please.

The fun part of being a feral druid is being able to pull nearly whole instances at once, which makes giving run throughs much quicker. Once I hit 80, I think I'll be able to pull Stockades all at once.

Belated post of my epic flight form, as I can't use it yet in Northrend. Only two more levels and 2000g until I can. :P

She finally hit just over 19,000 life and a little over 22,000 armor. Druid tanking so far has been a breeze and I'm enjoying it (even if it would be nice to DPS once in a while. >.>).


With the druid being leveled, not much else has gone on with my other characters. My hunter did manage to snag two new pets:

<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_010909_233620.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_010909_233620.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Cyric the Worg, who refuses to hold aggro and has really bad pathing issues.

<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_012409_233149.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_012409_233149.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
And Otto the Hyena. I'm so glad they added pet talent trees. I had a hyena ages ago when they were a less than ideal pet. :)

Other Alts:

<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_012309_181139.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_012309_181139.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Finally remembered to get a ss of my warlock and her Fel Guard, apparently. She'll be leveled with Lolo's hunter, so we won't compete for gear. She's demonology for now, and will probably stay that way until 80.

<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_012309_181203.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_012309_181203.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Enhancement Shaman. She's been getting some love lately, but is now parked in SW as I wait for Lolo and his paladin to catch up to her level. Once he reaches 28, she'll be elemental so he can tank and I can heal. She's working on her Darnassus rep so I don't have to get an Elekk. D:

<a href=""http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_012309_181210.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/us_or_them/WoWScrnShot_012309_181210.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Lastly, my mage. She's been leveled a whole level since I stopped playing a year ago. She did manage to snag a twink staff off the AH for 1g. One day, she'll be leveled. I need to play more DPS characters. </lj-cut>"

This is the hunter. It took her over a year to finally hit 70, but she did it. As soon as my druid hits 80, she'll be leveled next with Lolo's hunter. She did make use of her last Beast Mastery talent point and tamed a rhino for a tanking pet. At the moment, she's running around with an oversized bug which I've heard is a decent pet. I just think it's pretty gross looking. :P

Here is the Death Knight looking rather unhappy at the fact I haven't touched her in over two weeks. She *was* going to be my first character in Northrend but...well, it just didn't happen that way. One day, though, as Dreanei are just awesome to play. Plus she looks pretty badass.

Druid hit 73 yesterday after two hours of questing. Lolo wanted me to catch up to his shaman before we continued. Now we're more or less within two bars of each other. Been doing tons of instances to level. And I'm actually tanking for once, and doing *well* at it. :D I get about 3 or 4 offers to tank each time I log on. No idea what I was so afraid of before, really. :P When I get to 80, I'll have a raid spot reserved for me as an offtank/maintank. Now, if only leveling     didn't take so long. /sigh <lj-cut>"

Mine was decent enough. Finally got myself my Xbox 360, along with Fable II (of course), Assassin's Creed, and Rock Band 2. Fable has been pretty awesome. I've yet to play Assassin's Creed; Lolo's been all over that game since I brought it out. lol

We've actually started playing WoW together again. Did our first run last night. Was pretty uneventful, actually. Nothing good dropped, and we spent near 45 minutes wiping on the last boss. Originally I was going in as a tank, but we found a paladin at the last minute. Sad thing is, I had more life than he did in bear and he was 3 levels above me. :P

I found this while running across the map to the other starting point. Wrath definitely has some amazing detail. There are probably a million screenshots that I have that are just like this one. I'd say this is my favorite zone hands down.

This is my druid after her makeover. I tried to change her hair, but I just couldn't. My druid has looked the same for two years now. All I could change are her markings. And yes, that's a different mount. I have about 6 now. Still 34 short for the mount achievement. :P

And this is her in her feral gear. I'm slowly replacing all of it with greens/blues, but at least she still looks decent. If you were wondering, yes, my character list for this realm is full. My little DK is still sitting at 60 near the bottom. I have a screenshot of her which I'll post later on. She's still in Hellfire, and I've lost all motivation to level her further now that my druid is being played again.

That's it for now. I'll be posting more screenshots from now on, in case they get deleted or I have to reformat the computer again. Once I start raiding, there will be even more. :P</lj-cut>"

A couple of nights ago, my brother was looking for a bible for his theology project. For some reason, they can't find one and ask me if I have one. I told my dad no, I didn't.

""But don't you have one from high school?""

""No, I gave it away.""

Pause. 

""You *gave* it away?""

""Yes, it's not like I was planning on using it again.""

""But wouldn't you want to read it?""

""Maybe, but only as a work of fiction.""

Cue teh dramaz. My mom said she felt sorry for me for having such a void in my life, and my dad thinks Laurent turned me athiest and that he's very disappointed in me.

Didn't help when I brought up the whole ""Catholics are taught to practice tolerance, right?"" argument up. 

So now I'm an athiest/baby killer/anti-marriage(biiiiig wtf lol)/pro-divorce/pro-orgy(because if you're for divorce, that means you're a slut) miserable excuse for a person who is going to hell. 

And my dad hasn't talked or looked at me since two nights ago. Go go passive aggressive. Grow the fuck up, please.

Needless to say, I've been in a terrible mood.

It's times like this that make me hate religion. I find it a big waste to begin with personally, but I'm not going to go and pass judgement on those who practice it. Hell, I hung out with two roommates who were born again Christians without a problem.

Just...frustrating.


On a happier note, I picked up Wrath of the Lich King this weekend. As I have no wireless/internet to play it at home, I've left it over at Lolo's house and am only playing on his PC (amazing graphics! And no lag! I can has new computer?). Have yet to touch my druid/hunter, as I'm leveling those with his hunter/shaman, but I did start a lovely draenei Death Knight who makes the most rediculously awesome little squeaks when she attacks. <3

Plus the Death Knight mount? OMG AWESOME.

She may be only level 57 at the moment and still puttering around in the starting area, but I'm having a hard time deciding to keep my druid my main. :P"

Got some Christmas shopping done last night. Finally broke down and told Laurent what I was getting him since I was SO lost on what kind of computer screen to get him. :/  He ended up finding a nice HP 24"" screen at Brandsmart yesterday. It's $289, which is $2 under my budget for his gift. lol  It's a really nice monitor, though. Flatscreen. :D

It's going to be an expensive Christmas. :P 

Here's the list so far:

[1]My Mom/Dad: Record player. :D Picked it up last night for $206 (got the 4 year extended warranty on it, just in case) from Best Buy. It hooks up into the computer so my dad can put his records onto the computer/CD. My mom's wanted a new one for some time now, and since they're going to be redoing the entertainment system for the backroom, might as well give them one. :)

[2]Sister: Ended up getting the wrong thing at Target, so I'm exchanging it for a cupcake maker or something creative (Kinex, Legos...something along that line).

[3]Brother: He picked out a PC game. Gears of War, I think. I wasn't really paying attention when he gave it to me. :P

[4]Great Grandmother: Dressing gown and slippers...I know, I fail at old people....and kids. D:

[5]Laurent: He's picked out the screen he wants. Now we need to see where we'd get the best deal for it.

[6]Grandparents: No clue.

[7]Aunt and Uncle: No clue.

[8] Laurent's Parents: He's taking care of that.

[9]Me: I'm getting myself an Xbox 360 and Fable II. Laurent's getting me Guitar Hero 2, since he couldn't come up with anything to get me himself. :P


At least I've gotten most of it done. I should be finished by this weekend, hopefully. At least the malls aren't too bad...yet."

Anyway, I've noticed some weird things going on at home, and apparently my parents have as well.

My mom heard someone shuffling around in the living room/backroom of the house a few nights ago. Now, to be fair, she *had* just watched an episode of Paranormal State. The thing is...my dad heard it too.

Now, my dad doesn't believe in this kind of stuff at all. When I had my experience a few years ago at my grandmother's house, he made fun of me and told me it was all in my head.

He and my mom both went out and checked the area...only to find nothing. No one was out there (it was around midnight, one in the morning). They went back to bed, and a few moments later they heard it again. This time my dad went out, only to find *nothing* there.

My mom said he looked a little unnerved, which worried her because he never, ever gets like that. He's always got some rational explanation for all of this. This time he had nothing.

Seeing as this was all going on on *my* side of the house, I played it off, saying it was the crickets rustling around in their tank, or maybe some sort of animal on the roof. You know, anything to keep me from freaking out. lol

The next night, I woke up around 3 in the morning to find my ceiling fan had been set to its highest setting and was making a lot of noise. I'm pretty sure I didn't do it, seeing as I always keep it on a low/medium setting, and that's the way it was when I went to bed.

The kicker, though, came this morning.

I leave the house last in the mornings. I had just finished breakfast and was gathering my stuff to leave. As I'm at the back door, I heard a man's voice say ""Jackie"" in my ear. Like, as though there was someone <i>behind</i> me. I turned around and no one was there.

I am not making this stuff up. Maybe it's my overactive imagination? I'm hoping so. I have no tolerance for this kind of stuff. >.<"

This weekend is chocolate peanut butter cupcakes. Maybe I'll make some meringue and practice some different decorations.

I just got the weirdest call regarding a job position. Apparently they saw our company car (it says ""Now Hiring <b>Experienced</b> Marine Technicians on the back), and spent about 20 minutes chasing it, looking for our number. The lady admitted to not even *knowing* what we did or what our company name was.

And she was calling on behalf of her husband, who needed to job, but couldn't call himself because he was pumping gas they ""wasted chasing your company car"".

The kicker? When I asked if he had any experience with installing electronic equipment <i>on boats</i>, she said no, and asked if we would pay for his training.

Head, meet desk.

Yes, of course, we'll hire him right away! Who needs experience before they're hired, anyway?

Unfortunately, things do not work that way around here. I told her that no, we would not hire him without prior experience (shock!), and no, we would not pay for his training. She then proceeded to rant about how they had wasted so much gas chasing our company car for our number, and that we should reimburse her for the gas.

In a fit of boredom today, I decided to work on some specs for my Druid, Warlock, Hunter, and up-and-coming Shaman (hopefully my fourth 70). This is more for my reference more than anything, but comment if you have something to add.

http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Kargath&n=Eikcaj
This is my druid's current build, ripped off a tanking druid in the guild. I really don't care for the build, as it is geared towards a tanking feral, not DPS. Then again, who really brings a feral DPS druid when you could have a rogue? :/


http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Kargath&n=S%C3%ABtsuzoku
That's the lock. Again, I did not spec her. Lolo took her over as his PvP character (can ya tell? :P ). She'll be a Destruction/Affliction lock when she raids. Just want to hit Affliction for the Nightfall and Improved Corruption.

http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Kargath&n=Terue
There's the Hunter. She's not geared for Marksmanship, I know. She was BeastMastery up until this level, when I decided to try something else. What can I say...I love DPS. lol. I really can't complain about the build, since I haven't had a chance to try it out. I know I'll miss my survivability while grinding/farming though.

http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Kargath&n=Neve
Forgive the talent points there. Can you tell it's my first time playing a shaman? :P She's going enhancement up until 58 when I can get her some nice Elemental gear from the Outlands. That way she can either DPS or heal up until 70. Then the poor thing will probably end up Resto (It's the damn druid all over again) just so I can get into runs.

</lj-cut>

<b>Edit:</b> The talent calculator didn't save my stuff. D: Anyone know of one that will?"

<lj-cut text=""Wall 'o Text"">Lately, I've been thinking of what I'm doing with my life...again. Honestly, I'm as sick of this topic as I know the rest of you who read this journal are. I'm starting to second guess myself, which is never good.

Am I really wasting my life? Will I regret the choices I've made for the rest of my life. Maybe, but I can't say so with much certainty.

I know I'll regret bending over backwards to keep everyone happy.

I know I do regret dropping out of school, but not for the reasons everyone wants me to. Did I miss out on a great opportunity? Depends on who you ask. Me? The only thing I'm missing is my independence. I never really wanted to go to that school. I was just making my family happy. Am I going back to school? Yes. Do I know what for? Not at all. Does it bug me? Not in the least bit, though I know it should.

Yes, I'm 20, just two months shy of being 21. No, I'm not married/have a degree/still in school/graduated/getting into my career. All the things I should have done (based upon what I've been told). If I had the guts, I'd take off for a while. But let's be realistic...I'm not that kind of person. I hate being on my own. I hate being stuck in a large group of people. I procrastinate...terribly at times. I wouldn't last a moment on my own.

Shit, this has just gone from one tangent to another. It's not even halfway coherent. Who knows if it even makes sense? And why the hell am I so damn wordy? There's no one I'm trying to impress. I shouldn't even be apologizing...this is just supposed to be a dump to make myself feel better. And I do...in a way.

Coffee combined with pain pills is not helping.

Please, excuse this mess.</lj-cut>

Just because I can't leave this as is (much too emo for my taste), I feel obligated to post something else.

So Friday, I omgwtf pwned my ankle.

I can't see 100% at night. It has something to do with my pupils dilating too far at night. Anyway, I have issues with lights and depth perception at night. Not to the point where I shouldn't drive and the like, but enough that I've learned to be much more careful at night.

...Supposedly.

Anywho, GXE is located on the second floor of a building in a little mini-mall. I've got a fear of using elevators, and I'll be damned if anyone can get me into the one there. So I take the stairs. Going up wasn't the problem, it's going down that is.

Laurent goes down in front of me and I'm going a little more slowly, since it's dark and there is barely any light in the stairwell. Laurent trips and I snicker (Can you see where this is going? Karma ftl. D:). Just as I'm going to say, ""Man, it would really suck to fall here""....

The inevitable happens and I trip. Guess I didn't see the last step and assumed I was stepping off the last step. Landed none too gracefully on my ankle. Heard it snap twice, once when I fell and once again when I stood. I'm pretty sure it had dislocated and relocated.

Got home and iced and wrapped it. Spent all of Saturday off of it (mostly. I can't friggen' sit still all day). Any time I was up I was on crutches I had from the whole knee incident. Iced it almost continuously and had it wrapped.

Cut to today, Tuesday. It's still slightly swollen, and there's a really attractive black/purple bruise under the outside of the ankle. The top of the foot is slightly bruised as well, and so is the other side of the ankle.

Yes, I can walk on it. I can't really straighted out my foot 100%, but I'm almost sure I didn't break anything. And even if I did, I won't be going to the doctor until the end of the month when my insurance kicks in.

Nag at me all you want, but I'm stubborn and I'm not going. :P

...I wish I had something more interesting to add. :/"

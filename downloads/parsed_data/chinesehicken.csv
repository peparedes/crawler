Or maybe it just comes out wrong because you leave me so flabbergasted. I can't express myself when your stone cold eyes pierce my soul. Ignoring me only causes more frustration and I struggle for words and for a voice loud enough for you to hear me. If I scream, maybe you will listen - but it pushes you further away. You lock the door to keep me out, but it only makes me want in more. You leave and I immerse myself in cleaning - hoping your presence will wipe away. No matter if I'm wrong or right, I always convince myself that forgiving you is the best thing to do. But in doing so, I let myself down. I'm giving in and telling you that hurting me is okay.

Some time away from you would do me some good. But I know if I leave - you won't be here when I get back. I guess that's the part that hurts the most. You aren't willing to give a little to make me happy.

I guess I'm just tired of feeling like I'm being used."

"event","The greatest gift you can give yourself holds no material value, but is the most valuable thing you can have.  This gift is confidence.  Not just the confidence to wake up and face every day.  Not just confidence in yourself, in the knowledge that you are not less of a person than anybody else and you have the same right in living as the skinny bitches that rule society.  But the confidence that you will make the right decision.  This confidence frees you from the worry that chains you to depression.  The confidence that you know right from wrong.  While this confidence might look similar to the last confidence, it is entirely different.  This confidence ensures that although sometimes life might throw you a curve ball, the confidence will be in you to give you the courage to stand up and say NO!  Confidence also gives you the strength to start something new.  Traveling on a path to a new adventure can be frightening.  Confidence will stay by your side during your darkest trials and celebrate when you find a ray of light."

We always seem to fight- but no matter what we forgive each other.  I don't know if it is healthy to fight so much, but I guess when you are living with someone it is inevitable.  He's an awesome boyfriend, even if he does hurt my feelings once in a while.  He's just insensitive from growing up with a mom that cares more about keeping her house clean than showing affection.  

We leave for St. Louis on Friday, but will probably just crash in the hotel room that day because of the long drive.  We have a hotel room right downtown, so everything is close by.  It's only a 5-6 block walk to the Busch Stadium and even shorter to the Arch.  I've been to St. Louis before, but I was really young so I don't remember it all that well.  On Saturday, we're going to Six Flags..... I think I am most excited about that.  It's been a long time since I've been to any theme park besides Adventureland.

I seriously do not belong in any customer service position.  I just want to smack the shit out of these people who think I should bend over backwards to satisfy their needs.  Seriously, I just spent 10 minutes on the phone with a guy who needed directions to a place that is a block away from the hotel.  You turn left and walk one block... easy huh? no.... this guy kept asking... so if I turn left then I would be going this direction right? blah blah yackity smackity.

I should mark that walkie talkie so I never touch it again.

And right before I press the send button, I pause and contemplate whether it's wise to talk to you right now.  All the anger will come tumbling out and words will be said just to cause any pain I possibly can.  I want you to hurt like I hurt.  I want your throat to ache with the possiblility of losing me.  I want to be in control.  Pushing you away is the easiest approach to take.  If I announce that you're not good enough for me first - the pain won't seem so intense.  Overreacting is how I act - but not all the time.  But with you, you always make me feel like I'm overreacting when I'm just telling you how I feel.  Stupid.  Crazy.  That's what you call me or my thoughts.  You don't try to understand because I don't think you want to be running around in my crazy world.  You say you have enough problems... and that I need help. I know I need help, but mostly I just need to help myself.  

Is this really what I want?  Should I stay away for awhile until everything seems to fall in place and doubt is no longer a constant annoyance?  

I want you because your safe.  Because your here and I'm here and it's easy.  Because then I have something and someone to hold on to.  Like you said, it's nice to know that you don't have to worry about being with someone when your with someone.  But is just being with someone enough for me?  Can I not live without you?  What makes me love you - convenience or who you are?  Should it even matter?  Should I just forget that I asked that question and focus on the love that I seem to have?  Does the why matter anymore when the what when where and how are happening now.  

Even though I said I wanted a break, that I needed to think things through, I still want more than anything to call you - to be with you- and to know that you still love me.  Is that what this is all about?  Me needing to know that I am still needed and loved?  That you haven't moved on or I haved pushed you so far that you've thrown up your arms in exasperation and proclaimed yourself done with the relationship?  Should I just break down and give into my hunger pains - maybe, possibly so we can talk it out.... or do I really need to think?  Thinking is scary... something I don't want to do on such a topic....."

"event","I'm falling apart, both physically and mentally.  Why do I always have to make things more complicated than they actually are?  And why do I insist on messing things up by trying to fix them when I should have just left everything alone in the first place?  What is this strange desire inside of me that needs everything to be perfect?  My head is throbbing and when I try to ignore the pain to concentrate on some other point in my life, I discover something else that needs fix and the throbbing increases.  

All I want to say is I'm sorry for being who I am.  I'm sorry for what I've done and said.  I'm sorry that I'm not sorry at all.  An ache inside of me demands that I be apologetic, but if I wasn't reduced to having to explain this to anyone, I would still do everything the same way.  Maybe I am just a horrible person because I think and feel the things I do.  Or maybe I'm just a really angry person who can't accept others for who they are and thinks I should always come out on top.  I don't know, but I do know.  I just don't want to say it because I don't want to be horrible in your eyes."

"event","I am soo bored and have absolutely nothing to do at work.  It pretty much sucks to work 8 hours a day and not be busy.  But I guess that's good because then I get to write on here.  I'm really excited about moving to Iowa City, it's like I want to get everything settled right now so I know what I'm taking and how it's getting there.  I can't wait until I'm actually out on my own and close to Trevor.  I've been missing him a lot lately and reflecting back on the weekend I spent with him cuddling and kissing.  That was so awesome and we didn't fight at all.  It's like when we are apart, we have to knit-pick at each other and our nerves are short, but when we're together it's so awesome.  We don't care about the little things as long as we know we love each other.  On June 13, it will be our 4 month anniversary - 4 months of being together but not actually being together.  We've spent so much of our relationship apart, that it will be interesting to see what happens when are able to see each other more.  On August 13, it will be our 6 month anniversary - half a year together and this will be the start of actually seeing each other.  It's so weird if you think about it.  

God, John Kenniker just walked in.  He expects me to play nice and talk to him like nothing happened, but I still resent the day he walked in here and thought he could say that shit to me.  And it hurts that everyone else thinks I should be OK with him being here - just get over it.  But how do you get over someone saying things like that to you?  It's just like Sharon threw salt in the wound by allowing John to be housed in the office.  I guess she ""had her hands tied"" though.  Whatever.  

Last night I was supposed to hang out with Andrea, but when she called I was watching CSI with my mom and the phone was out in the kitchen so I didn't hear it.  We haven't had time alone in a long time - like she said - I need my Melissa time before I go into withdrawl.  HAHA yeah ok.  But my back really hurt last night so I decided to take a few Tyenol PM and sleep instead. The things that people say are really true, you really do forget about all the things that happened in high school and you lose contact with your best friends.  You think that at that moment, you will never forget the humiliation you felt or lose your popularity, but really once you cross that stage and recieve your diploma - nothing matters.  You look back on the events that caused your heart to race and palms to sweat and you just wonder why you let all of that effect you so much.  But what I hate the most is the lost contact with friends.  I remember back in middle school when we all would hang out before school began and dream about the future.  We decided that we would all live together in a mansion in Florida and how great that arrangement would be.  Now, Rachel lives in Tennesee, Andrea in Missouri, and I'm going to Iowa City.  We're hours and worlds apart.  I guess when you don't work at a dream and throw it in the back of your mind, they just decay until they disappear.  It's kind of depressing that I'm ok with my friendships breaking up, but really I can't do anything about it so there is no use worrying about it.  And maybe I am somewhat of fault for these decaying friendships because I could put more effort into preserving them, but it just never seems to work out as it should.  People have busy lives to manage and paths to follow in order to contribute to society.  

It's just now hitting me that there are so many possibilities out there, so many things to learn and directions to take.  I can do anything with my life.  So instead of being depressed about if I will succeed as a writer or journalist, I'm thinking about how I now have control and the power to do anything.  God, it will be so great not having to worry about what my mom will think or what opinion she will have.  

There is a writing conference listed in the paper.  I really want to attend, but I would have to take work off and I really need the money.  When I read the advertisement for the conference, it reminded me that I have been slacking off on finishing all my stories.  But the ideas and plot are slipping from my mind, and once time passes you start questioning yourself as to if the great idea you had really is that magnificent.  The magic has subsided and now reality sets in, but I still have to keep reaching for the possibilities. 

Kelsey had her baby, so now she will be out of the office for awhile- freaking hooray!  She was driving me nuts when she was trying to boss me around and tell me exactly what my job was.  I don't think Kelsey should be pregnant for awhile, it just makes her 10 times bitchier than she usually is.  (And damn that's bitchy.)  

Sharon will be coming back from her vacation and that is both good and bad- good because then I will have something to do-bad because then I won't be able to fuck around on here as much as I would like.  I probably should clean the office so she comes back to a refreshing start, but nah.  I would rather sit on my ass and ramble off my thoughts.  

I think it is so weird how people change their personalities according to the person their with.  Actually, it's retarded that people let others change them by forcing their personal beliefs on them.  Mindless sheep.  How many faces do we all have?  Perhaps we all have multiple personality disorder.

I wish lunch would come so I could leave.  Sometimes, I really do dispise being in the same place every day and having to look at the same confining walls when it's beautiful outside of them."

"event","If you're like me, you're usually late to three-fourths of the events in your life.  Why?  Because your five miles down the road before you realize you forgot some important object that you just can't do without that day.  Then you must decide, should I back track, waste valuable time, and arrive late; or should I continue and feel like I'm missing something all day?  It's a hard decision, but it's wonderful when your options are open and the decision is available because sometimes you're five miles down the road, and there is no choice if you want to go back or not.  You think that you're doing great, escaped from all the sticky situations you might have led yourself into, but BAM, everything catches up to you and it's too late because you've traveled those five miles and you can't turn back.  On this road, you must suffer the consequences of your actions and wonder what else might pop up along the way."

Other times I feel like I can't move.  Like I'm so lazy and fat that I don't even deserve to have a name.  My name, what is it?  what does it mean?  When people say it, sometimes I don't recognize it or the fact that they are talking to me.  Why does my name seem foreign to me?  

I'm not sad, I just need to move on, drastically.  I feel the ache inside of me that yells I don't belong here.  So where is it I do belong?  It's so weird now thinking about all the possibilities ahead of me- where to go next?  I know - Iowa City will be coming up... but I will have so many options in front of me.... so many chances to be without my mom and make my own mistakes without someone breathing down my neck about how it was the wrong choice.  Is it wrong to have this love/hate relationship with your mom?  Somedays I wish she would just disappear and other days I want nothing more than to be a little girl again and crawl into bed with her.  She had this picture of a little girl and her mother snuggling and it was just reassuring to look up at.  

I don't know what I'm saying anymore.  Mostly, just random thoughts and ramblings because I really don't know how I feel anymore.  These blue walls are suffocating and I really do get tired of looking at the same scenery every day."

"event","A constitutional democracy values basic rights, freedom of expression, privacy, and justice.  Citizens of American should feel that they are free to exercise their basic rights as outlined in the Constitution.  They should also feel that their privacy is not being violated by laws or regulations that the government makes.  Contitutional democracies believe in popular sovereignty, where the ""people are the ultimate source of the authorty of the government which derives its right to govern from their consent"". (Constituation Democracy)  Also, when it comes to voting, a majority is required to approve laws or regulations.  This ensures that no laws are passed that could possibly harm America's core values.  There is a limited government with a constituational democracy which means that not one person has complete power in deciding how America will be ran.  The check and balances system meets this requirement and ensures that the powers are both seperated and shared and that one branch of the government does not hold too much power over another.

In order for a constitutional democracy to work, there needs to be free play of ideas among the citzens.  They need to feel that the government is open to their ideas.  The citzens will then feel their freedoms and rights are being upheld through democracy and will instill democratic faith."

"event","The USA Patriot Act was passed after the September 11th attacks that devastated the United States.  The act is meant to stop terrorists acts while uniting and strengenthing America.  This act is extremely controversial in the federal legislation because some view it to be intruding on our personal freedoms.  On March 2 of 2006, the Senate voted 89-11 to renew this act and on March 7, the House of Representatives backed the Senate up with a 280 to 138 in favor of the renewal.

Many laws were amended because of the USA Patriot Act.  One of those was the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Sureveillance Act).  This was meant to put guidelines on what the United States could investigate.  The act said that people who are known to be a member of a terrorist group or if they are engaged in espionage, they can be searched or investigated.  Among many of the investigations the United States can legally hold agaisnt these people are: they can be physically searched and their records can be searched.  In 2004, under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, the FISA law was expanded to permit the United States not only to search people who are known terrorists or spys, but people that they suspect to be a threat to America.

Another controversial part of the act is section 215 which allows FBI agents to obtain personal records like internet files, library records, phone bills, or anything that they feel would be important to determining the outcome of a case.  Many people argue that this crosses the line and steps on the personal freedoms of American citizens.  There have been many attempts to limit section 215, and on June 15 of 2005, Bernie Sanders succeeded in amending the section through the House of Representatives.  This amendment prevents funds to be used by the FBI to search library and book store records.

Section 805 was ruled unconstitutional on January 23, 2004 because it was too vague.  This section said that ""expert advice or assistance"" was support of terrorism.  Judge Adrey Collins ruled that this was in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments and the section was thrown out.  Section 505 was also ruled unconstitutional because it was a violation of the First and Fourth Amendment.  Section 505 allowed the government to obtain internet records from ISP (Internet Service Providers) without judicial oversight.  

Among the resistance in the government, eight states and many cities have condemned the Act for attacking civil liberties.  In fact, the Gallup Poll showed that many citizens were wary of the Act.

When I went to Spain in 2002, I know I felt a little worried about the trip.  It made me feel even more worried when I heard that the security for the airport was increasing.  My thoughts were of people searching me and my personal belongings and not that they were protecting the United States.  I know this might seem a little selfish, but I don't think it is right for the government to be allowed to violate the personal freedoms of citizens.  The USA Patriot Acts do not make me feel protected in any way.  In fact, it makes me feel just the opposite.  It makes me wary of my government.  No one should be allowed to go through your records or physically search you unless they have probable cause."

One step, two step, bite your lip, just a little bit further.  Hang on to the tear drop that threatens perfection until you reach your destination.  Three step, four step, blink until they disappear because courage is never supposed to be shed.  The problems in my head are nothing more than ghosts swimming chaotically.  I can never fully focus on one before another thrashes uncontrollably.  I feel overwhelmed."

"event","""You stay because you don't think you deserve any better"" Those words, spoken from a movie screen hit a home run to my heart.  When I was a naive girl, I believed that it was enough to proclaim I would never allow myself to fall victim to a manipulator that it would never happen to me.  I never understood why a woman would let a man cause her such pain.  The hurt they go through seemed to surpass the amount of love they could ever have for that person.  And I guess that maybe I wanted to be strong in announcing I would never let myself have that kind of relationship because I had lived my childlife in the hands of an abuser.  I never knew what was worse - my dad for hitting me or my mom for letting it happen.  I would lay underneath my covers and ask myself how could a mother stand back while her children were being beaten into the ground... not only by the blows but through the words.  I wanted her just to leave him... I told her over and over again that I would be happy anywhere else - even if we had to live in some cracker jack house.  I didn't care because at least I would feel safe to come home.  At least I would not feel like I was nothing.  At least I would have hope for the future. 

But now I understand... you stay because you don't think you deserve any better.  And while everyone is telling you that you shouldn't have to go through it... in your mind it doesn't matter because that's what you've allowed yourself to be reduced to. Granted my relationship isn't that of an abusive husband or boyfriend - I have a manipulative family that lets me believe that I owe them something.  And they do this because they know I will stay.  They know that no matter how much pain they cause with the words they throw around, I'll come crawling back and pretend the bruises aren't there.  I'm no different that my mother, or my sister, or the millions of women that end up bruised and broken because I've allowed myself to get manipulated into thinking I don't deserve better - well fuck you, I'm moving on."

"event","Sometimes it's hard to make the first jump off the cliff.  It shouldn't be so difficult for me, but I've been teetering on the edge unable to make the plunge.  Should I stay or should I go? - The universal question.  I am dying to make a difference and to spread my wings and fly away from it all, but what if I fall?  Failing is one of my biggest fears that I've never been able to conquer.  Being unable to control my destiny drives me to insanity and makes me back away from the edge ever so slightly.  Change hurts.  It can destroy everything you ever knew and toss it into a box labeled ""the past"".  Box up my friends, my mom, my memories?  I'm not ready to.  I'm not ready for it to end, but I'm dying for a new beginning.  Can I hold on to one thing while I grasp for another?  Caught in the middle, I would just wind up stretched to a limit.  But perhaps I can throw down a rope and jump from rock to rock until I reach the ground.  Each small step would help in accomplishing what I need to achieve.  Then, if I need it - I will be able to return to what I have always known.  But is that a copout, not being able to make the big leap?  Perhaps, but I'll have it my way."

"event","A memory pops into my head at weird moments in time.  A face, a whisper, a touch, a dance.

I miss the art of dance... the way it made me feel free and immortal.  Movement of words, body, and soul intertwined to create a shattering performance full of passion and love.  The pain of wanting something so much and practicing over and over again to achieve the impossible, and the joy of finally making it happen.  So many years dedicated to something I cherished, why did I throw it away and pretend like it didn't happen? I failed in creating pictures through pencil and paper,but I could paint pictures with the movements of my body.  So today, worlds away with fantasies preoccupying the mind, I escape where ever the music leads me."

"event","Wow, I have incredibly neglected my journal - but I guess I just haven't felt the urge to write about how shitty my life is because lately it hasn't been that shitty.  Yeah I still occasionally have the tear jerkers and temper tantrums, but since I quit Casey's my life has gone much smoother.  Also, I'm extremely excited to be moving to Iowa City away from Creston and my mom.  It will be nice to finally be out on my own and not have to worry about someone breathing down my neck and badgering me about what I'm doing.  

This weekend I actually spent in Iowa City and in Illinois with Trevor.  A damn trooper stopped me on my way - how inconvient and totally unnecessary!  Sure, I was going 84 in a 70 - but isn't the speed limit just a suggestion?  Tornados invaded Iowa City on the night I decided to drive the long 3 hours there.  It was crappy because I had to spend the night in the basement of a restraunt with my potential room mate, her friend, Cassie, and Amrita.  Bitchy people really pissy me off especially when there is something terrible going on  -- and Lexi (room mate's friend) was extremely bitchy and self centered.  After surviving the natural disaster, we appeared unscathed with our tummy's still rumbling because our food had been taken away from us.  After awhile, we decided to take our chances and drive back to the dorms.  The next day, apartment searching was real fun driving through the chaos the storm had caused.  I didn't find any apartments I really liked, so I probably will have to venture up to IC again sometime soon if I want to have a place to rest my head without the fear of getting raped or killed.  

I had tons of fun at Trevor's house, even though his mother ended up freaking out on me and making me feel like total shit because I wouldn't find a damn easter bunny she had ""hid"" for me.  I mean, come on!  I am not 4 years old and I don't need someone in my face telling me I have to participate in something I don't want to.  She felt bad after screaming and harrassing me, though, and made me look through millions of pointless pictures with her.  

And.... I went to my first strip club, which was - boring.... I don't need to pay 15 bucks to look at boobs when I can do the same thing by looking in the mirror.  But, it was interesting to watch the girls give themselves pole burn.

Cuddling with Trevor was the highlight of the weekend.  I loved to feel his arms around me and his breath on the top of my head.  I felt safe and cared for - something I haven't felt in a long time.  Maybe sometimes I just try to over analyze our relationship and that's what makes me doubt it.  Sometimes, I can't stand the thought of not being with him and telling him all about my day and other times I think things are moving too fast and we need to slow way the hell down.  I'm just so confused when it comes to love and being in it.  I can fall in love - I've mastered that part- but the actual staying in love and making it work is what I'm having difficulties with.  I always think - what if there is something better out there - what am I missing?- and then I start to despise the fact that I am tied to one person.  But so far, it is going good with Trevor.  I haven't wanted to go out clubbing and grind up agaisnt guys and I have even not had the urge to talk to the various lunatics that reside in the chat rooms.  

But sometimes I do doubt... and I feel like a bitch for it - but when it's all out in the open, my mind becomes so clear that I know exactly what I want - and that's to be happy and I think I can be with Trevor."

The weekend was much dreaded, but for no reason at all.  My anxiety of being at someone else's house for the weekend melted when my aunt gave me a bed instead of demanding that I sleep on the floor like other unwanted guests.  

Sioux City is a long way to drive - especially with your grandma and mom as passengers.  Trips are only worth while with the music blasting and wind blowing in your hair.  Aw, sweetness.

Ashley was happy - for the moment.  Despite her long sweater, we saw the cuts on her hands and wrists.  Denial and frustration raised in ugly red strikes across her skin.  She wrote me a letter full of the pain and anguish she experienced throughout her life.  She asked for my forgiveness and if I could look at her with the same eyes as before.  Why does she think so highly of me when all I can remember is heartbreak and failure?

Just so you know, morning sickness sucks - but then again this isn't the morning is it?"

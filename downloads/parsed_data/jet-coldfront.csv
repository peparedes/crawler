"event","&nbsp;Lately I have noticed a disturbing trend developing, so I thought that I should make myself clear.<br /><br />There will be no hugging me, or thinking about doing so. Whining will not help, nor 'puppy eyes' attempts to get at my spark. You try, I <em>will</em> shoot you or throw you to the nearest more bad-tempered decepticon.<br /><br />Please try to keep in mind that I am a decepticon. Though I won't kill you on sight, I want no fleshling displays of affection. Go find the nearest autobot instead, like Ironhide.<br /><br /><br /><strike>Unless I'm drunk.<br /><br /><br /></strike>Sunburn."

"event","<p>*Shuffles papers*<br /><br />I'd just like for all of you to know...<br /><br />Since Coldfront is currently out cold in the game, and was regretably eaten by the kraken in the chatbox. I will be taking over the updating of this place until further notice.&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you have any idea of how much <strike>fun</strike>&nbsp;it is to comb the beaches for all the neccessary pieces? And I hate puzzles...<br /><br />Later, I would also like to have a talk with you about that magic marker thing...<br /><br /><strike>Doing that to a poor, passed-out mech. And I have got a hangover too.<br /><br /><br /><br /></strike>~Sunburn~</p>"

"event","&nbsp;Arrived at&nbsp;Earth following some glitch of an autobot. Had been eluding me and Sunburn for weeks.

Got the gnat in the end, but not before he managed to offline Sunburn.&nbsp;

On my own for now, but there seems like other decepticons have been here as well. Will have to try finding out what happened to Megatron.&nbsp;

Looks like Optimus Prime may be somewhere on the planet as well. Till I can track that one down though, I'll have to find entertainment where&nbsp;I can.

Disgusting little bags of flesh, the natives of this planet."

"event","<p><strong><font color=""#ff0066"">This years Fourth of July went off with a huge bang in my life. It's the end of a saga that lasted nearly 3 years.&nbsp; In fact tomorrow would of been Geoff's and my third anniversary if we had managed to stick it out. Instead last night just before the fireworks I confronted him with Jenn, the girl he cheated on me with for months. And boy was he up shit creek without a paddle. She called me on Thursday night after a bunch of messages via myspace we spent 3 and a half hours talking and put together a timeline of when he was cheating on both of us. So we decided to confront him last night, and we did so spectacularly. I finally put into words just how much I hate him and actually loathe him which I find to be worse and I told him if he ever thinks about calling me or emailing me again I will have a restraining order put on him because he is out of my life for good. He made me think I was going crazy with all the lies he would tell me, and the lies he would tell her.&nbsp; He was doing the same exact thing. There was nothing he could say to defend himself so he just said well now that you two have each other I'm leaving. It felt so damn good to watch him good. Emotionally I'm just like hell yea! My life is turning around for the better. I feel it every day.<br /><br />Zach was here last weekend for my friends wedding and he was just great. Though I know that we won't likely ever be a couple he's the kind of guy that I would love to be with. Someone I can be myself 100% and be totally comfortable. That's such a rarity to find these days. And guys in Boston don't leave me with much hope but I'm sure I'll find someone someday.<br /><br />It's been almost a year since I've written last. I just started losing myself and finding bits and piece's of myself in different places. I've picked up knitting and crochet. I've started losing weight though the eating today has been horrible. Lol and I'm hoping that I don't have to many medical problems. My doctor wants me to get an abdominal ultrasound as I've been having really bad heart burn and abdominal pain with it. So that should just be fun fun fun. I've already had an internal one and breast might as well just ultrasound my entire body! Also I need to repeat a liver test in 6 months. The numbers are still the same and I really need to work sugar out of my body and system. NO MORE SODA. SODA BAD. This is going to kill me lol. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ff0066"">So here is my final salute to Geoffrey Silas Merrill - you bastard KISS MY ASS!</font></strong></p><p><font color=""#ff0066""><font color=""#000000"">Kiss This<br />(Aaron Tippin/Thea Tippin/Philip Douglas)<br /><br />She was a woman on a mission<br />Here to drown a man for leavin<br />So I set her up again to watch him drown<br /><br />She had just about succeeded<br />When that low down no goodcheater<br />Good for nothing came struttin' through the crown<br /><br />Oh he was layin' it on so thick<br />He never missed a lick<br />Professing his never ending love<br /><br />Oh but I never will forget, when she stood up and said<br />Well I guess you think we're just goinna kiss and makeup don't ya<br />(That's when she said)<br /><br />Why don't you kiss...kiss this<br />And I don't mean on my rosy red lips<br />Me and You, oh we are through<br />And there's only one thing left for you to do<br />You just come on over here one last time<br />Pucker up and close your eyes, and kiss this...good bye<br /><br />Well the next thing I recall<br />She had him back against the wall<br />Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone<br />She was putting him in his place<br />And I mean right up in his face<br />Draggin' him down a list of done me wrongs<br /><br />It was just about now that the crowd gathered round<br />They came to watch him pay for his every sin<br />She called him everything under the sun<br />And when we thought that she was done<br />She ran back and she let him have it again<br /><br />She said...she said<br />Why don't you kiss...kiss this<br />And I don't mean on my rosy red lips<br />Me and You, oh we are through<br />And there's only one thing left for you to do<br />You just come on over here one last time<br />Pucker up and close your eyes, and kiss this...good bye<br /><br />Kiss this<br />And I don't mean on my rosy red lips<br />Me and You, oh we are through<br />And there's only one thing left for you to do<br />You just come on over here one last time<br />Pucker up and close your eyes, and kiss this...good bye<br />Kiss this</font><br /></font></p>"

Forgive, sounds good.
Forget, I'm not sure I could.
They say time heals everything,
But I'm still waiting

I'm through, with doubt,
There's nothing left for me to figure out,
I've paid a price, and i'll keep paying

I'm not ready to make nice,
I'm not ready to back down,
I'm still mad as hell
And I don't have time
To go round and round and round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is
You think I should

I know you said
Why can't you just get over it,
It turned my whole world around
and i kind of like it

I made by bed, and I sleep like a baby,
With no regrets and I don't mind saying,
It's a sad sad story
That a mother will teach her daughter
that she ought to hate a perfect stranger.
And how in the world
Can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter
Saying that I better shut up and sing
Or my life will be over

I'm not ready to make nice,

"event","<font color=""#993366""><strong>Oooh I like this topic!&nbsp;This week has been a&nbsp;huge reading week for me. I finished A Fine Balance by&nbsp;Rhonin Mistry FINALLY! Then I read and finished The Road by Cormac McCarthy on Friday and now I'm reading Kushiels Justice by Jacqueline Carey, needed something more or less lighthearted after reading those first two.<br /><br /><u>A Fine Balance</u>. This was a supremely&nbsp;well written book, that during the first 30 pages or so I really didn't like it since it was just so damn&nbsp;depressing. And it is a depressing book, but there&nbsp;is an upside to&nbsp;it all then it drops right back down again to misery.&nbsp; But honestly its a story of the humanity and how life&nbsp;comes full circle, no matter what we do to rise above it,&nbsp;there is always something to beat us back down. Key example Dina,&nbsp;happy willful child, with an a&nbsp;strict older brother Nusswan, their father dies and Nusswan becomes man of the house.&nbsp;Now Dina is expected to fit into the mold of a perfect little angel, he refuses to&nbsp;let her have friends and has her&nbsp;taking care of their mother, and the housework, so her grades suffer. And as a consequence he pulls he&nbsp;from school. Though good for her she rejects all the men he brings to the house to marry her off to and actually marries the man she loves. Though tragedy strikes again when he passes away on their 3rd anniversary so now she battles loneliness and supporting herself through a myriad of ways, and through these enter three men. Maneck, Om, and&nbsp;Ishavar, all with sad sad stories of their own. Now no longer lonely, but not sure on how to interact with these men&nbsp;they live&nbsp;and learn together and things become better. But the struggles of these people are incredible. I&nbsp;recommend this for anyone who can stomach&nbsp;such a strong tale.&nbsp;Once you become invested&nbsp;in the characters its a book its hard to put them down.<br /><br /></strong><strong><u>The Road<br /></u>I would of waited to read this one if I didn't have to give it back to&nbsp;my&nbsp;co-worker - again another depressing book.&nbsp;Its in the midst of a nuclear winter and everything is dead, its not sure how long its been a&nbsp;nuclear winter, and for the main characters it seems to have been a&nbsp;long time. The child seems to know nothing different than&nbsp;what is currently though he is ten, and apparently the mother and wife died a long time ago. They head to the coast in order to find&nbsp;what is not clear. Blue water, the good guys, something. People are desperate, resorting to cannibalism to survive. The father and son spend a good deal of time alone, though the son has a tender heart wanting to share what they have with others, while the father&nbsp;obviously more practical says those people are going to die anyways and then when we&nbsp;are starving you'll wish we&nbsp;kept the food. This was a tale that tore at the heart strings&nbsp;and knowing that in this day in age it&nbsp;could happen at anytime. Nuclear&nbsp;War will destroy the earth and will humanity survive to see the world reclaim itself?<br /><br /></strong><strong><u>Kushiels Justice<br /></u>Back to the realm of fantasy, of mystery and intrigue, of love and loss and pissing off the Queen!&nbsp;Gotta love pissing off a queen.....I won't go so far into this one because I have&nbsp;friends who have yet to read the second Kushiel Trilogy!<br /><br />Now for the rest of the books that I have yet to read. I just ordered a couple of new ones from paperbackswap.com. One is The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and Making of the Oxford English Dicitionary, and the other is a cook book, Healthy Indian&nbsp;Cooking. Samosas anyone???? =) But I also have a few books being sent this&nbsp;way. One is entitled Quarter Life Crisis and Eye of the World by Robert Jordan, I am going to attempt one last time to read his series the Wheel of&nbsp;Time and hopefully make it through all of the books this time.<br /><br />Friends, maybe its not exactly friends but I just don't understand the games people play. In fact I find&nbsp;the dull and wearisome. I was sharing some text messages with a friend earlier, and this is what they amounted to more or less.<br /><br /><br /></strong><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /></font>&nbsp;"

"event","There is a major wildfire going on in Idaho right now and its shameful that today is the first time I have seen any mention of that on the news or in the papers or anything. My cousin lives in Idaho in Sun Valley where he works and the first mention of it was a tiny little paragraph in Boston Now, and then in the Metro all there was was a picture of a firefighter and the blaze behind him with a teeny little caption. Both mention that the fire is going up the west side of Bald Moutain and heading into Sun Valley. Since Sun Valley Resort is where all the happy rich people go, it finally merits a teeny tiny little mention. Sometimes this country just sucks when it comes to reporting about our own! I haven't talked to my cousin in&nbsp; few days so I'm hoping that everyone has been evacuated.

Ok I just checked out whats going on in some papers online and Sun Valley hasn't been touched yet though a good portion of one of the mountains is now charred. I'm still a little worried though and hope that they contain this sooner rather than later."

"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px""><font color=""#009966"">Several articles this morning caught my attention:<br /><br /><strong>TWO TEENS SHOT NEAR STATE HOUSE</strong><br />Ok this one here isn't anything new. Though it was quite different to walk down Tremont St, the length of Boston Common and seeing a huge chunk of it cordoned off with crime scene tape. Two teenagers were sitting on a park bench on Sunday night when a guy flipped out because he thought they were talking to him and started shooting wildly. One of the bullets broke a window of the state house.&nbsp;<br /><br />"" The governor is deeply disturbed by any acts of violence in the commonwealth and is particularly upset with one that caused a bullet to break a window at the State House."" Patrick spokeswoman Cyndi Roy said.<br /><br />I laughed when I read this, he is particularly upset by a broken window?? I would be more upset that more people are getting shot, and maybe this is a wake up call to get the government to wake up and do something about all the gun violence in this city. This place is becoming fairly dangerous thats for sure, despite measures to do something about it,&nbsp;it just seems to be getting worse as time goes on. Though it seems like most of the violence is in the poorer sections of town, its spreading to the more affluent areas, and is only going to continue to spread.&nbsp;<br /><br /><font color=""#ff3399""><strong>OBESITY RATES SHOW NO DECLINE<br /></strong>This one rates its own section especially since I was talking to Abhi about it last night. Mississippi became the firest state to break the 30% barrier of obese adults. And the highest percent of children ages 10 to 17 is in the District of Columbia.<br /><br />I find this to be so frustrating not just as a national epidemic but also in my personal life. I've always fought with my weight and the feelings of frustration, helplessness, and depression that go along with it. Fortunately the solution is quite simple when it comes to losing weight and being healthier. Eat appropriately and get enough exercise to start burning all of it off. Easy Peasy. I wish it were so, I've never been overly motivated to do get off my ass and do something and when I do, all of the negative feelings come crashing down and I feel like crap about it and end up giving it up in the end. It seems pointless to walk and not go anywhere on a treadmill, I can't think of anything more annoying that going to a gym and feeling like a rat in a cage trying to go somewhere but ending up nowhere.<br /><br /><font color=""#9999ff""><strong>AND MY FAVORITE ONE OF THE DAY . . . .<br /><br />SEX NEVER GETS OLD<br /></strong>This was great - to know that when I am in my 80's that I can enjoy an active sex life. WONDERFUL!!!! This is great the same joys we get from it now can live on. As its a toning exercise, as well as still releasting endorphins.&nbsp;And the fact that the seniors aren't ashamed to admit that they do have sex.&nbsp;As long as everyone is happy all will be well. Just hope they're using protection!<br /><br /></font></font></font></p>"

"event","<font color=""#cc0066"">8-23-2007<br />Its an cold morning again this week - the summer has faded away in a draft of cold wind. Today is the morning that I wished I had woken up earlier or gone to bed earlier. Though I don't think it would of made a difference last night when I went to bed one of Ian's women was taking a shower, and when I woke up this morning Ian was in the shower. I didn't have time to wait for him to get out of the shower before I had to leave for work. UGH! So I'm tired and dirty feeling today. Its amazing at how much a morning shower helps to wake one up and energize them for the day.<br /><br />What fun last night was though - I went over to Kate's for dinner with her and her boyfriend, George, who's from Maine also so we spent some time talking about places back home. He's going to take Kate to Booth Bay Harbor, its a tiny little hamlet of a town thats a lot of fun. I love these tiny places in&nbsp;Maine that are just so quaint and peaceful. But poor Kate wanted to make mini raviolis for dinner, and they tasted like Cheez-its with sauce. Oh well could of been worse thankfully we went out for ice cream afterwards.<br /><br />8-24-2007<br />This morning was helacious. I lost my T-pass for getting to work via bus and train, its somewhere in my apartment so now I have to do some major hunting tonight when I get home. Definitely not a fun trip into town, and getting home is going to be a longer drive, rush hour in and rush hour out with idiot people who don't know how to drive! Sheesh. Yes I am one of those people.<br /><br />So my patience is waning on all fronts. I'm tired of waiting for the state to make me a permanent employee yet. My friends and family keep getting frustrated with the situation, more so than I am I think. I'm a patient person what can I say, but theres just so much a person can take and its annoying as hell since I've been here for a year and still nothing has changed and its even worse now because all of the paperwork has been submitted and still no word from HR about being permanent. Sigh! This is only part of my patience that is waning, the other is my relationship status, I'm tired of being single. This isn't a rant or anything else just a statement of fact, I want to get married and have a family, this has always been my number one goal, more so than my career. I often feel like I have been born into the wrong century. I have to admit to a certain amount of envy when I see families out and about, especially when those people are my age. My friend Elise, married 3 kids, the oldest just started school a week ago, and she and her husband run a ranch out in Montana!&nbsp; My dream life, with the exception that I'm allergic to horses!<br /></font>"

"event","<p>Gotta love having an allergist appointment first thing in the morning, especially when they are testing for what your allergic to. But the first thing the doctor says to me this morning is ""You have to get rid of your cats."" I politely said ""thats not a possiblity"" what I really wanted to say is ""ARE YOU SMOKING&nbsp; CRACK?!?!?!?!""&nbsp; The doctor was nice I do have to give him that, but that is the worst possible way to start off a conversation with me. Besides if I wanted to get rid of my cats I couldn't. Honestly though if for some reason that I am not able to keep Mittens she is to go back to Cathy, the woman I got her from. But having to find a new home for Precious would be next to impossible - he's such a little hellion that I wouldn't be able to place and more than likely would have to have him put down. I DON'T THINK SO! And if Mittens went away I would hate to think on how miserable he would become. So guess what the kitties are staying put! So there.<br /><br />But on the other downside I have to make a ton of changes to the way my home is and I know I'm not going to get any help from my roommates regarding this. The biggest one is to my bedroom, I'm allergic to dustmites (this is a new one) and the best way to combat them is to wash all of bedding once a week in hot water, and to cover the bed, box spring, and pillows with a cover that is hypoallergenic and doesn't allow the mites into the bed. Of course this shit is expensive. So essentially I need to live in a bubble. What really stinks is that I wanted to get a down comforter, and I'm allergic to feathers. Visting my parents house is going to be a&nbsp; pain in the ass, as they have a bird, cat, and dog, and my dad smokes like a chimney! Thankfully none of these critters go into the guest room.<br /><br />Less than 45 minutes to go in the day. Pierre was in Augusta the last time I called him - so he should be here before 6 or 7. Though he is going to hit some crazy rush hour type stuff. But on top of seeing a good friend, I can't wait because he is bringing cross stitch stuff from Mary&nbsp; and I now have a lot of books to read - super exciting. Life is good at the moment. I'm happy for now.<br /><br />Hope all is going well in the rest of the world with all the happy people!</p>"

I am a sudoku lover, it helps the day go faster when I am work and have nothing to do, like today! I have a hard enough time solving a samurai sudoku, which I really enjoy and now I have been handed the ultimate challenge a sudoku cube......Oh my, giddy with anticipation - I have a feeling I'm going to be working on this all weekend. I haven't even started it yet and it looks to be near impossible on just doing the normal sudoku square.<br /><br />What a week this has been only an hour and 15 minutes till go till the weekend. I'm looking forward to going home to some peace and quiet. Every night this week I have gotten home late, spent it with friends, ended up doing something. Tonight is my night! I just want to go home and get some stitching done. Watch some tv, clean the apartment and start getting things ready for our new roommate to move in. Because Ian is absolutely zero help when it comes to this. Ugh the guy is a nasty slob in the bathroom - he doesn't wash the sink down after he shaves and its just gross!"

"event","<p>No this is not meant in a good way. Today just started out in the most annoying way possible. After a great night last night. We had one of our book club meetings and this time we had a bunch of new people join us and the group dynamic is wonderful. A couple of my friends joined, as well as some other people and we just had wonderful conversation even though we didn't read a book for this month. But our book for next month is A Fine Balance by Rhonin Mistry, so far its pretty depressing. So after leaving around 9 so I could get some grocery shopping done.&nbsp; I went to sleep around midnight. And was woken up at 4:15a due to my roommate leaving the kitchen light on. So after going back to bed I ended up having the weirdest dream......<br /><br /><em>I'm standing at a snack machine, somewhere in the world goodness only knows where, and the guy who plays Clayton Webb on JAG (Steven Culp) was standing behind me and telling me that he needs me to go with him to pick up a person of a sensitive nature. So I leave with him, and we drive to Logan, and we pick up this guy dressed all in black and wearing a black hood over his head. Strange very strange I think I'm watching to many espionage type stuff lately. We get the guy to the car and Steven Culp says to me uwrap your gift. Ok I know what you guys are thinking now. But I pull off the hood and its Abhi. Ohhhh-K. He is obviously not very happy&nbsp;at this point. So fastforward and we're sitting in what I assume to be my apartment. We're sitting cozily on opposite ends of the couch with glasses of wine and laughing and talking and having a great time, but every time we try to move to get closer we can't and so we stay at our own ends and talking. I know it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out.</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />The alarm went off at 6:30 and I didn't get out of bed at 7:20. So I'm running late, I get to the bus stop on time, and the bus is running late. When the bus does finally come its almost 8:30 and I have to be to work at 8:45. Yikes. But the best ride into Boston was just horrible. There was a woman with twin boys at least 3 or 4 years old and HYPER. So they're yelling and screaming and she's yelling at them and pinching them when they won't sit still. Like that is going to teach them anything! She was pinching them and twisting and I just felt like going up to her and doing it to her. She was hurting and scaring her children, the only thing she accomplished was them fearing her. And if she is pinching them like that in public what is she doing behind closed doors? I know this is only one instance, but I hate to see children terrified, I grew up like that, and its not easy and it makes life harder as an adult thats for sure and the pattern continues. My friend Mel is a key example. Her parents berated her and yelled at her, and who knows what and she is doing the same thing to Emily calling her a little brat and screaming at her. Its horrible. I feel like telling her why don't you try a different approach and see what happens. Children are not meant to be angels and as adults we sometimes give them reasons to act out - but we can change that and most of my friends see that,&nbsp; thankfully!<br />But on top of the kids screaming and acting out on the bus, there were two women who are at least my mothers age comparing their breast sizes LOUDLY. Not a conversation to behaving that loudly in a public place no matter what your age. And the final straw was this Asian girl who was wearing a very full back pack. I'm sitting in my seat, and she is forced to lean back into me because she and her friend refused to walk to the back of the bus to make more room in the front. So people are pushing by her and she keeps leaning into my lap and hitting me with her bag. Common courtesy is to take the bag off and put it on the floor out of the way so there is room for everyone. People in this city just don't get it sometimes.<br /><br />So by the time I got to work I was pretty cranky and its almost time to go home and I find myself still venting about all of this. oh well time to go ttyl<br /></p>"

"event","Hey so its another weekend. I've just stayed home and done pretty much nothing this weekend. I haven't been feeling so well thanks to mother nature, and my head has been throbbing all day today. I did get all of my laundry done though!

So whats going on with me. I finally talked to Stefanie and she gave me the webpage to view her wedding pics. I need to get some money togehter so I can order a couple of her pics. She and Dave are a gorgeous couple and I AM so happy for them. After looking at the pics I've gotten some ideas for Jenn and Chris's wedding. Though thankfully thats a couple of years away. There's going to be so much to do, and unfortunately I haven't been feeling quite happy for happy couples lately. Especially when I am being inundated with pictures of wedding dresses, and bridesmaid dresses, at least Jenn is choosing sensible colors which are deep red wine colors like burgundy. Which thankfully will look good on all of us. Now to keep her away from the sheath dresses!&nbsp;

It looks Iike I'm going to be going to NYC for a weekend in September to visit Stef and Dave its been almost 2 years since I've seen them. The last time I was with Geoff and we had gone for Thanksgiving. So its going to be nice to visit them without someone being around. Also yesterday I found out that my friend Eugenia is now living in MA, though on the other side of the state. Hopefully I'll be able to visit when I borrow Pierre's car while he's in Cali for a week, plus I can go out and get a look at Amherst and check into what I would need out there so I can get ready to move next year. Once I get my bills in order that is.

I'm not sure what else is going on with my life but at the moment friends are abounding and hopefully I'll be able to see them all soon."

"event","<font color=""#9900cc"">Yep its FRIDAY - this annoyingly heinous week is over! With the 4th of July falling in the middle of the week it just seems insanely long. We got lulled into a Saturday-like day and then thrown back into the fray fresh Thursday morning. Thats just not fair.<br /><br />So as for the rest of life its going well. The roommate search is a pain in the ass as always. I've been looking for roommates non-stop since December. Every 3 months someone moves and its a pain in the ass. Our landlady is not going to allow any more subletting - so that should be interesting. Especially when I am ready to move out because I have a feeling that that is going to be sometime close to the end of the lease but not quite. The good news here is that Ian has taken over the whole roommate search pretty much. The guy is a born salesman, which honestly I think he might be coming on a little too strong and last night he had people scheduled to look at the apartment till 10:30. WTF?? I don't think anyone showed up though because I was up till 10:45 waiting to find out if there any other new people to meet.<br /><br />Linda let me borrow her computer while she was out of town for the 4th which was great since I was able to do some job hunting. I applied for a lot of jobs some part time some full time, pretty much anything to get extra money and get back into the food world. The permanent jobs I've been applying for are with hospitals so that I can get into nutrition. I might be over qualified for them unfortunately, but there are a couple that I hope I get because they would be good experience and an excellent lead into grad school. Plus making more money than what I am making now is going to be great!<br /><br />The worse thing that happened this week is that I got in another fight with mom and dad. I'm really tired of my parents and thats too bad. They're just being themselves and they don't realize that is what is pushing me away from them.&nbsp; They're attitudes, and if I am not all about them then I am a bad and horrible daughter, a selfish little bitch who cares nothing for anybody else. What started this off is I told them about Hope and Rhonda's offer that if I want to move back to Maine they will help me, and help me get a place and to get back on my feet. I told mom and dad that as bad things were the other day I was thinking about their offer, but I opted not to because I really want to do this on my own.&nbsp; Well needless to say WWIII broke out dad dis-owned and hung up on me, mom is calling Hope and Rhonda faggot dykes and everything else. The sad part is I laughed, because 20 minutes later dad calls me back and lays into me again and mom is still screeching like a freaking banshee working herself up into hysterics. The funniest thing is though - its dads pride that is hurt, and mom was begging for attention from me because obviously I give it ALL to Hope and Rhonda and not her. Jesus Christ who the hell do I call 2-3 times a week when I'm sure my dad isn't home to see hows she doing? But apparently I'm not giving them the chance to help - but the problem is they can't help me even as much as they want to. Sigh. Welcome to my dysfunctional hell. Even if I wanted to go to Florida and have their help I would have to live with them for awhile and the last thing I need is my father berating my mother telling her to shut up and what an idiot she is and passing that along to me and start laying into me like that. I moved out when I was 20 and I swore I would never live with them again on a permanent basis. And I won't.<br /><br />Only 45 more minutes till the end of the day. I can't wait to go home. Its been a long day today. Plus I haven't been sleeping all that well lately. Oh well.<br /><br /></font>"

"event","<font color=""#008080"">Ok I must once again admit to being in a bad mood. This sucks!&nbsp;I cleaned the apartment this past weekend while Ian was at work and Selina was out doing her own thing. No big deal though it would be nice to have some help. But as a consequence my allergies were so bad I woke up with a hangover style headache Sunday morning. Then Ian and I switched rooms. So I am back in the room at the back of the house which is nice. I don't mind having the smaller room in fact now that I don't have everything in there that I did before its much cozier. And darker, I hate having light in my room while I am trying to sleep so sleeping is going to be much much better. Though it wasn't last night. It was horrible I ended up waking up at 1:30 and reading till 2:30 because of my allergies and feeling like shit. Then the alarm goes off at 6:45 and I have been feeling tired and cranky all day. I feel bad for people who have to deal with me on a regular basis. Quite frankly I just want to cry I feel so bad.<br /><br />I'm in the middle of what feels like a million and one things going on around here. I want to do my work, but the printer is down so I can't do anything there and there is only an hour left in the day. I was hoping to get out of work early tomorrow to get an early start to the 4th of July though I wasn't planning on doing anything major. I just want to cry but sleep seems like a much better option.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well some good news, I applied for a part time waitressing job with Ivy Restauarant - dinner is reservations only and its very pricey - which means good tips and good money. Thats essentially the only good thing to come out of today. Well there are a couple of others. Wow I am so negative lately - yikes. But I'm borrowing A Thousand Splendid Suns from Sarah in the book club, and Linda is lettnig me borrow her computer for a couple days while she is out of town. As much as she drives me crazy sometimes with her relationship issues - she is a good friend. I just got to listen to more than I want to.<br /><br />I had to reschedule my appointment with my therapist till next week as I don't have the money to see her this week. I hope things go well with this one. I want to be happy again, I want to stop being bitter and hateful towards the people around me but I just can't seem to get out of this funk and there is nothing more that I want than to wake up and be happy.<br /><br /></font>"

"event","<p>Being an adult sucks. I don't remember what I pictured my life being at 26, but this sure as hell wasn't it.&nbsp; I'm 26 years old and I keep wondering how my life has ended up like this. I know there are hundreds if tens of thousands of other college graduates out there who can't make ends meet. But I still feel like I am losing my mind. Alexandra Robbins wrote a book called Quarter Life Crisis. Yeah thats my life a quarter life crisis. Well since I need to organize my thoughts just going to switch to the old stand by questionnaire. Amazing how it allows me to answer whats going on in my head without it becoming a jumbled mess. That I can do with my journal at home.<br /><br /><strong>I See:</strong><strong><font color=""#009933"">&nbsp; Besides the daunting pile of CQE's (data entry stuff for work) that are beside me on my desk and that this is a nice summery color for today, I&nbsp;don't see much. I'm between and rock and a hard place and I can't seem to find my way out. Or at least I don't see one at the moment. I owe money and I have absolutely no money. Well I take that back I have $20 to get me through till next Wednesday when I get paid again.&nbsp; But today I am able to pay my landlady $200 not by choice and my rent is $550 per month! I got a bank check so that my landlords can cash it with no problem. That way they can get their money and I can get caught up and I can stop avoiding them out of shame.&nbsp; As I said I'm 26 years old and I can't do a god damn thing!<br /></font>I Need: </strong><strong><font color=""#009933"">A lobotomy? To relieve some of this pressure in my head.&nbsp; Monday and Tuesday were just horrible, when I needed my family the most to be supportive they tell me don't worry about it. Don't worry about it? WTF! My student loans went into default on June 13, 2007 and I'm not supposed to worry about it? I have a chance to rehabilitate my loans but in order to do that I need to come up with $605.00 before July 15. I don't see that happening either lol. When my apartment got broken into all I wanted was some time with people who love me and can help make things better and my dad told me to stop running from my problems. Running from my problems? I didn't know wanting love and support was running away. When I told my parents I wanted to get back into therapy - my dad told me to take karate lessons to focus my life. I start therapy today at noon time.&nbsp;<br /></font>I Find: </strong><strong><font color=""#009933"">That to quote my earlier self - being an adult sucks. I may not have had the best childhood growing up, but anything is preferable to the way things are going right now. That I am more frustrated than not when it comes to my friends and I am more than grateful that they put up with me in my current state. I called Hope and Rhonda the other night and they helped bail me out of trouble this week. My electricity was going to be shut off yesterday I paid the damn bill last week, but due to a mess stemming from the break in, the check bounced. Long story short, computer stolen (had account info on it), so opened a new bank account had $300+ in said bank account. The old account was still waiting for checks to clear, which over drew the old account, so the bank took it upon themselves to transfer the $300+ into the old account in an attempt to bring it current but all they did was leave both accounts in a negative state. I was finally able to close my old account, but I can't do anything with the new one cause its still negative and what little money I get I need to cash and hand out to the people I owe. Talk about frustrating.<br /></font>I Want:</strong> <strong><font color=""#009933"">A lot of things the first and foremost is to go and entire day without thinking about my money issues. To actually have a normal life where I don't have to worry about where every little penny is going. . . . .<br /></font></strong><br />Ok I just got back to work from visiting a therapist who was EXTREMELY helpful! Unfortunately I won't be seeing her because I can't afford the $25 per week. But she did have some suggestions and other places for me to go to&nbsp;get help.&nbsp; Its amazing what was accomplished in an hour. Nothing life affirming or life changing but just helpful suggestions. And honestly it feels good to take a proactive approach which I haven't for the longest time. Its not going to be easy but then again what is? So to continue where I left off<br /><br /><strong><font color=""#009933"">. . . . .I want to achieve my goals and get out of this rut that is my life. I want to be a registered dietician, I want to help people. But as they say you can't help anyone till you help yourself.<br /></font>I Have:</strong> <strong><font color=""#009933"">A tiny glimmer of hope, its slim, but there is a way out. This is good because I sure as hell didn't have this, this morning and its now a reason to smile.<br /></font>I Need: <font color=""#009933"">This is funny to hear from the therapist today as I explained my past relationships - ""with every thing that is going on this must be a very lonely time for you."" and ""As soon as your ready I encourage you to find a partner"" Odd. Very Odd. But its true I do need someone in my life. But more than that I WANT someone in my life. I need to get my life in order, one day at a time. I need to get over my fear, because this situation is very frightening to be in, my parents are in a bad situation, I'm in a not so good situation, and it is frightening. Now I need to stop being afraid of my landlady.<br /></font></strong><br />I don't think I need to go into further digression here. But this covers the basics and now I am waiting to find a therapist that I can see on a regular basis and get more things worked out. Also, its time to take charge once again. I'm a stubborn and tenacious woman its gotten me through life so far, and its time to bring that back to the forefront.&nbsp; Cause once I do, nothing will be to hard to handle.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

Though this weekend has been better than the last few.<br /><br />And apparently NOT! GOD DAMMIT. I just checked my account balance for my checking account. I havne't closed the old one yet and they took the balance I had in my new one and applied it to my old one which leaves both account in the negative. Jesus H. Christ. Why do I keep getting F***ed by this shit? Thankfully today is a holiday and the banks are closed. So I can deposit $100 into my old checking account tomorrow and then again on Wednesday and then close out that account. The take the remainder and apply it to my new account and hopefully bring the balance back up. Goddamn these&nbsp;mother fucking greedy sons of bitches of fucking Corporate America. I hate this fucking capitalist country! No one can get ahead - sure as hell not the college graduates. Our economy sucks. I can't imagine why people want to live here, because there is no such thing as the American Dream. You work hard all your life for nothing. It never fails and it never ends. I am always going to end up owing someone something all the time. I hate it. I feel like I will never be self sufficient. I'm always going to be relying on someone to get my ass out of trouble and end up owing the world.<br /><br />I guess I'm a little infuriated. I just can't believe this. Actually I can. Its the story of my life. Oh well.<br /><br />On the flip side of things I've been working on a list of goals that I've been wanting to reach. They are as follows and are not in any particular order.<br /><br /><strong>1. Get student loans back on track. I have put my VSAC on another 6 month deferment hopefully within 6 months I'll be able to start paying on those again.<br />2. Take the GRE before January 2008 (need to start studying again)<br />3. Lose 10lbs<br />4. Get finances in order (starting with my bank accounts!)<br />5. Apply for grad school<br />6. Start paying people back the money I owe them.<br />7. Get my own apartment<br />8. Get back on line at home<br />9. Travel more other than going to Florida. I want to take a real vacation one of these days preferably somewhere I've never been before.</strong><br /><strong>10. Just be happy, which is an uphill struggle at the moment.<br />11. Meet someone great and if I'm lucky at least be engaged by the time I'm 30. This isn't forthcoming either at the moment.<br />12. Get renters insurance, you would of thought that I would of done that already, but no money means no nothing. Big surprise there.<br /><br /></strong>So yeah I'm a little bitter at the moment. Oh well I'll get over it.</font>"

"event","<p>Why does this shit keep happening to me? Though last night was first for me ever in my entire life. Someone broke into my apartment, and stole my laptop, my digital camera, and two pieces of jewelry, one of which being an emerald and diamond 14K gold bracelet my parents had bought me for a christmas present, and a 14K gold necklace with a sapphire and diamond pendant. They left the pearls, I hate the pearls. And they left the ring Geoff gave me, they could of taken that and I wouldn't of bothered reporting it missing. Thankfully they left the necklace Hector gave me for&nbsp;Valentines day,&nbsp;it wasn't in its normal hiding spot or else it probably would of ended up stolen as well. Who would do this? I feel so dirty and I don't want to go home. . . as if I don't have enough shit hanging over my head right now. I'm happy that I am still in good standing with&nbsp; DELL, even though I don't like the company at least I can get a new computer and a new camera. The jewelry I'm afraid is gone forever. Though I am still checking Craigslist and Ebay periodically througout the day and probably will continue to do so.<br /><br />I honestly feel so violated, and hurt, and angry. I try to see the good in people but this really just makes me angry and disgusted with humanity. I want to cry, but I haven't done that since I talked to mom and dad last night. I wonder what they touched, what else did they take that I haven't noticed yet? Did they go through my underwear, did they enjoy what they found there?&nbsp;<br /><br />One thing I don't want to hear what ""doesn't kill you will only make you stronger"" FUCK THAT! I'm tired of being on trial in my life, and having to go through these tests to see how strong I am. There are some people that can just glide through life with no problem what so ever, and then there are those of us who have to fight for every single step we make. I am frustrated at having to fight for everything. Builds character, WHATEVER. I'm sick of it. This past year has probably been the worst one of my life. I'm in a job that doesn't even pay my rent, and I have to work two other jobs to not even scrape by, I have so much I want to do and I am not allowed to because of my financial status. I can't even by a pair of new jeans without wondering if I can afford it or not. I spent $200 on my new uniforms for work at Andrews and that has set me back almost two weeks.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm 26 years old, and single, and I often joke that I get what I want out of life and that is true to some respect,&nbsp; but everytime I get what I want I end up paying for it and I pay for it dearly. What I want right now is so damn simple, it relaly is. I just want to be held. Nothing more nothing less. Thats all, that and to be allowed to cry, instead of being the rock that everyone leans on, I wand to run and scream and throw a hissy fit and not even care. But I can't. I just don't understand why I can't have more than a few seconds of peace in my life before its shattered. I now get to go home and clean. I definitely need to clean my room and get a safe deposit box, and get renters insurance, and all that jazzy stuff and hope that my stuff comes back.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm buying a new computer and camera from Dell, and Its going to jack up my monthly payments, but oh well. I can't live without a computer. I really can't. Its the only way I can actually talk to some people, because I can't talk to them any other way. Plus with everything else that I do on it, shit. I'm just trying to imagine everything that I have lost on there besides pictures. Good God please just give me a break! Let my life work with me for a change instead of against me.&nbsp;<br /></p>"

"event","<font color=""#3300cc"">This is color suits my mood well today. Bluish black. I'm feeling like such a loser today. I really am. Things are just getting out of control and I am trying to figure out how the hell I am supposed to raise the money I need to pay my student loans before they go into default. Which looks like it will be the end of May though I don't believe the people that called yesterday because they couldn't give me an exact date. So its probably not until June or sometime around then. If things could only hold out till July - so I can be hired permanently by the state. But it doesn't look like its going to happen. Being hired permanently will happen, my loans not going into default before then likely not.&nbsp;<br /><br />So what happens if my loans go into default, well the worse thing is my parents cosigned for me.&nbsp; So the bank will be putting a lean on their home propery. Not good. Especially since their financial troubles are massive due to moms surgery, we're not sure when she is going to be able to go to work and they cannot survive on my dads paycheck alone. Big surprise. When it comes right down to it for me, they would garnish my wages up to 15%, put leans on anything that I own (which I don't own anything) or will own. I will lose all financial aid if I decide to go back to school which I want to do, and I want to go to Boston University, but if this happens then its likely I won't be able to go period. So UMass Amherst which the state will pay the tuition for. So not all hope is lost, but this is going to have serious life long complications.&nbsp; What makes me so angry to is that the student loan people seem to think that I can pull this out money out of my ass. That its just sitting somehwere in waiting to be spent. I have no money, honestly I have nothing. I need to figure out on how I am going to pay my electric bill this month, let alone the gas bill.&nbsp; But the worst thing of all this that the entire $53,000 comes due.&nbsp;Honestly I wish I had never gone to school. And to make matters ever worse my dad is beginning to agree with me. After yelling at me for saying that now he agrees because it goes back to him too. He is such a hypocrite sometimes.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm trying to be proactive about this. I was just on the website of the company that has my student loans and found something known as Loan Rehabilitation. This would be a good thing.&nbsp; I need to call the loan people tomorrow and see whats up with that. Amazingly that has never come up in phone conversations. Maybe things aren't as bleak as they seem. And they seem pretty bleak. I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens and hopefully I'll have enough money.&nbsp;But I've just picked up two weekend jobs. One of which is&nbsp;hanging out with kids&nbsp;for some events, and the rest are working with&nbsp;Catering&nbsp;by Andrew working some events. Hopefully these will bring in some extra income. Working at&nbsp;Andrews its about $100 per shift and I can work two or three in a weekend, and the kids thing is $15/hr for&nbsp; however many&nbsp;hours those events last. I'm usually bored on weekends anyhow so this should work out just fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Its such a quiet day at work today. I'm spending time doing cross words and reading. Its really dull. But thats ok my boss is out of the office until Thursday and I can guarantee that Mon-Thur next week is going to be busy for me at least I hope so.&nbsp;<br /><br />So whats coming up? Jenn's graduation is next weekend, my friend Pierre is going to be driving down from Maine to pick me up and then we're going to drive back to Maine. He's crazy but he wants to do it. I just need to get ahold of him to make sure that it is till going to happen.&nbsp;<br /><br />Other than the fact that I am going to be working a lot I think I have destressed for today. Its been a good day at work, and the day is almost over hard to believe that it has taken me an entire day to write this posting. But there you have it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dinner with my friend Linda tonight and hopefully clean my room - maybe I can stay up till 10p. At least then I can try and sleep in tomorrow. Though Precious will have me up at 6.<br /></font>"

"event","<p><font color=""#ff0066"">I've been sleeping like the dead lately, and waking up exhausted. Weird dreams have been plauging me for the last couple of nights, this morning was one of the strangest yet. <font color=""#ff3366"">It was weird, I was holding a baby that has messed his diaper, and the closest place to change it was a McDonalds bathroom. So I go in there and put the kid on the changing table and start changing him and all of a sudden he's a doll and the head pops off and so don't his legs. But he's still messy so I put him in the sink wash him off, and water runs into the hollow body, then I pour it out. Then I put his legs back on and then his head and then he a real baby again. Very weird. I told one of my co-workers and she's like uh oh Michelle - baby dreams??? Yeah I don't think so. But seriously the dreams have a Alice in Wonderland like quality to them, its been odd to say the least.<br /><br />As for the rest of things, I've been feeling a little frustrated and upset with myself for the past couple of days. I can't seem to keep my finances together. Every time I turn around, something happens and I think this time its going to kick my ass. I feel bad about this, it really makes me feel like a failure, every time it looks like things are going to be ok, I end up falling further behind. I'm 26 years old why can't my life be ok, why do I have to work ten times as hard as everyone else for little or no reward. When I go out with friend and spend $5 I have to wonder if its going to keep me from paying my electric bill or buying groceries.</font></font></p>"

"event","<font color=""#990033"">Life is interesting at the moment. I'm sitting at home watching tv, CSI to be exact and taking a break from working on my cross stitch and my phone just rang twice. Both numbers are unknown meaning bill collects especially if they don't leave a message. If a message is left then its my landlady 9 times out of 10 that is.<br /><br />So the reason I am posting today is there has been a lot of relationship drama in my life lately and none of it mine. But the most serious case is with my friend Mel, she and Josh broke up on Saturday evening. I'll admit that it was a little bit of a shock but wasn't entirely unexpected. Sorry Mel if you ever read this. Mel seems to be doing alright though I am happy to hear that she is going to be looking into therapy tomorrow. I've been worried about her for the past few years. Though what was scary Saturday night was the fact that her biggest upset was that she would die in her parents house among many other things. It was very hard to hear, but I let her cry and hoped that it was just all talk and since then I have checked in daily with her to see how things are going. Today she told me that she blew up at her mother and pretty much has a severe Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde situation going on.&nbsp; So hopefully a therapist can help her out, she seems ready for it which I wish her all the luck. I'm thinking about calling her mom and talking to her about having Mel come down here alone for the weekend just to get away and take some time to breathe. Mel wouldn't leave Emily behind unless her parents are willing to watch her for the weekend. I think I can get Janet to agree to it and she knows I won't take Mel out to do too much crazy stuff, mostly because I can't afford it. Who knows whats going to happen at this point, I just want&nbsp;for her to be happy to love her life again.<br /><br />Things in the rest of drama land are going ok, or as ok as it gets when one friend and her boyfriend are possibly thinking about getting engaged, and the other friend is dating a married man. As I have said before I don't need a relationship I have plenty where my friends are concerned.<br /><br />That leads me to my next issue - I'm a sexual person and lately I just haven't been feeling it as much which is a relief. I'm finally getting to a point where I don't really care about that anymore. I don't want it and&nbsp;I am getting tired of&nbsp;the innuendo.&nbsp;I've pretty much stopped dating at this point because of it. I don't want to sleep with these guys and I don't know if I am giving off phermones or what&nbsp;that says hey lets try to get in Michelle's pants. I've stopped talking to&nbsp;people because of this lately. So I figure its best just to stop&nbsp;the&nbsp;dating until&nbsp;a real man who is interested in more than screwing me become available.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok done venting about stuff, on the career path things are looking good with the state. Despite embarassing wardrobe malfunctions, and other odd moments. I enjoy job for the most part, I work with a great bunch of people who I am comfortable working with. The great thing last week is my boss took me too lunch for Adminstrative Proffessionals Day. Which was really nice of him we got to talk and learn more about each other. The best thing was when he asked me what I plan on doing with my life. I told him that I want to get my Masters in Nurition and then he started telling me about the state paying for 100% tuition. It might be worth me moving to Amherst. That is if I don't get in to Boston University. I haven't given up on this it will happen within the next year or two I'm hoping. Everything could fall into place if I can make it another 8 weeks. Not so long but maybe too long, I hope that I don't fall down into a deeper hole, but everything is falling down in pieces and maybe it will fall together and life will be easy for once. I doubt it.<br /><br />I'm reading this over and it sounds so negative, but I think that part of it is just because I am so tired. But over in my mind life is sligtly negative at this point. Though honestly I'm happier than I've been in a long time. I'm happy with myself for the most part, just want to drop a few more pounds and call it good. Then I'll be ecstatic. Things are better now other than the financial situation and that will get better with time it might get worse before it gets better but it will get better.<br /><br /><br /></font>"

Life gets ahead of us and we just don't stop to&nbsp;do anything about it anymore and its sad. So here is an entry - and I wonder how long before anyone of my friends reads it.<br /><br />So whats going on in the world of Michelle? It really&nbsp;seem like not much, but sometimes its just a bit overwhelming. The most recent crisis has been boy&nbsp;related. After Geoff I&nbsp;have taken a hiatus of sorts from dating. I&nbsp;have dated occassionally and its turned out ok. But really just feels like a huge waste of time sitting through a meal with no hope of ever&nbsp;seeing the person again.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;picked up another male friend, for the&nbsp;necessity of taking care of mother natures urges towards pro-creation without&nbsp;actually pro-creating. Thats one headache I don't need at the moment. So for the most part I'm avoiding guys in a relationship sense.&nbsp;<br /><br />Though enter the new roommates Allen and Roberto. Both nice guys and it seems like Roberto has developed a crush on me. Ok this violates the roommate code somewhere. I just know it does! He saw fit to tell me that he likes me and ok my radar is going on the fritz and I'm freaking out because I don't want to hurt anyone and well hopefully I nipped this in the bud because its just NOT going to happen. This is one absolute I can and will standby. But the little turkey turns around and buys me a small vase of Roses for Valentines Day. So returns the freaking out stage. Though honestly I think things are going to be ok with the three of us. If not well we'll see what happens. As for the rest of the guy problems: Mark is moving out in less than a week and internally I am doing cartwheels and screaming hallelujah! This kid is the absolute worst roommate I have ever had next to Scott in college!&nbsp;<br /><br />Then enters Abhishek. This is one man I can't wait to meet. A guy I met totally by chance via the internet. We'll have been talking for 4 years come March or April we started chatting during the my first semester at NECI. Awhile ago we started talking in more or less a romantic sense and that stopped once we both started seeing other people. But after our relationships ended we started talking again and he's coming to the U.S. in a few months. I have to admit I am excited, and nervous, and a little neurotic about this at the moment. There are so many what ifs going through my head. Its ridiculous! But my biggest fear about all of this, is everything is going to change either for the better or for the worse but after this nothing will be the same again. We were talking last night and he&nbsp;challenges me so much we ended up having one of our old style conversations. Talk about mind olympics I actually had to turn everything off so I could focus on the&nbsp; conversation something I haven't done in awhile. I can only imagine what these conversations are going to be like in person. I have a feeling we'll be debating everything of consequence and discussing animatedly things that aren't of much consquence. Though I do have a reply to his question ""Why do we live?"" its kinda smart ass answer ""What does it matter? We're already here!"" So a few more months and who knows what will happen.<br /><br />I'm back to working two jobs again and may have three depending on what happens with Jesse, this guy is horrible at getting back to people and he wants me to do the food for an event of his. Catering again but this time on my own. I can deal with that. It should be interesting and I am looking forward to it immensely. I miss working with food. I had a three day weekend, one of the joys of working for the state. So I ended up doing a lot of cooking, I made a Mojito Chicken - yummy, and some manicotti also delecious, I was just a cooking machine this past weekend. It felt so good to make things. I need to get some veggies or make more glaze to go with the chicken because as it sets it gets a better flavor. Gotta love roasted chicken recipes. Food is good!&nbsp;<br /><br />I finally have my book club up and running and we have a good crowd of people that gets together once a month. I'm amazed it took me almost three months to get things together and finally. Finally it looks like things are getting to where they are working really well. We have fun together meeting and eating across the city. Books that we have read are:<br /><br />The Year of Magical Thinking - Joan Didion<br />My Sister's Keeper - Jodi Picoult<br />Water for Elephants&nbsp;- <br />The Glass Castle - Jeannette Walls<br /><br />So there is my life as it currently stands. Hopefully writing will become a part of it once again on a regular basis. Who knows. Once I get ready to start studying for my GRE exams. Life should be really interesting!<br /><br /></font></font></font></p>"

""Before He Cheats"" - Carrie Underwood

Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleach blonde tramp,

carved my name into his leather seats...
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights,
slashed a hole in all 4 tires...

Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.

Right now, she's probably up singing some
white-trash version of Shania karoke..
Right now, she's probably saying ""I'm drunk""
and he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky,

"event","<font color=""#3399ff"">I fell asleep late last night...nothing unusual there. I was watching Harry Potter and got interrupted twice with phone calls. So I just finished watching it later than I wanted to. But the odd thing is I had the weirdest dream last night. I mean honestly I dreamt about two of my ex's (Bill and Hector) and a friend (Jeff McKay). The only one I ever talk to is Hector and occassionally Bill when he is in the mood to be slightly chatty. And I haven't talked to Jeff since April I think.<br /><br />So here is the dream as much as I can remember a few hours later.<br /><br />It starts out with me hanging out with Bill, and things are going ok. Though in my dream&nbsp;Bill is like he was&nbsp;in high school and we were dating. It was very close and very intimate. Though I am exactly the same person I am now. Very strange. We were sitting in his room and talking and out of the blue he asks me ""do you love me and only me?"" In order to spare him hurt feelings I tell him yes and start kissing him. After a few moments, I get up to go to the bathroom. When I walk out&nbsp; the door I walk into Hector, literally. Again this is the Hector from when we were dating, not the friends that we are now. This scene is reminiscient from when I came home from VT and was waiting for him to come home from work, and he came into his apartment and pulled me onto his lap and just held me tightly.&nbsp;I am remembering Bill whom I had just left in the previous room when Hector kisses me and tells me he loves me and that there is no other person in the world for him, and I am torn, because I do care about Hector deeply and I tell him too that I love him and want him. He pulls me upstairs and halfway up his hand becomes Jeffs.&nbsp; (This is where it gets odd because I have never had the slightest inkling of emotional attachment to him) we go into Jeff's room and he pushes me onto th bed and starts undoing my shirt, saying the same thing that the other two have said and to be fair I tell him that he is the love of my life, though I am lying through my teeth because I don't want to hurt him, since he is my friend (again he is a teenager). After a few moments I am back with Bill, and feeling extremely guilty for lying to him and knowing that if ever finds out he is going to be hurt. The same thing happens with Hector and Jeff. I run out of the room and they all end up chasing me and cornering me, but before anyone could say anything and make me out for a liar I wake up.<br /><br />Thats it.&nbsp;<br /><br />So here is my interpretation. Knowing Bill's personality when we dating I see him representing the quiet, and needy side of myself. Hector represents the part of me that always to do the right thing. And Jeff represents the narcisscistic side of me the part that always needs to be right.&nbsp;With there being three of them I see&nbsp;that&nbsp;as being indecisive though why&nbsp;&nbsp;those 3 I don't understand. I don't understand why all 3 of them want me to be in love with them and I can't be in love with any of them. That may have nothing to do with it.&nbsp;<br /><br />So analysis:<br />I'm not sure why I am indecisive maybe this is something that will show itself later. Or it maybe the fact that I have an interview tonight for a job in a liquor store and that I am having a hard time with my decision to leave the Food Industry as I am always looking for a way back in.<br /><br />The love part may be because I am feeling lonely and want someone to love me. Just for me and really see me for who I am. And I am indecisive because I am&nbsp;not looking for anything&nbsp;but&nbsp;I am wanting a physical thing at the moment with no emotional attachement if I could get that right now, I would take it. At least it would give me a sense of fullness for a little while instead of this empty feeling&nbsp;I've been having for months.<br /><br />Or honestly I could be completely off base but this is the only thing that&nbsp;seems to make sense to me.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /></font>"

And all is well, I am going be going back to Physical Therapy which reminds me I need to find the number for Joint Ventures so&nbsp; I can set up an appointment. Yay. Physical Therapy...... Also there is skin discoloration on my chest, that I have found out is a fungal infection. Which I am 90% sure I got from Geoff.&nbsp; He has the same thing on his arms, and says that it is heat rash. I got very frustrated with him last night when we were talking, it really hurts that he won't listen and always has to be right. I just wish he would try the cream on his arms to see if it works and the stuff goes away. Its really annoying and the more we talk the more frustrated I get and the more I realize that I was becoming very unhappy in our relationship when we were dating. I was so infatuated with him before and now I find myself thinking, what did I ever see in you? As I have in all of my previous relationships except for Frank. Unfortunately I find myself becoming unhappy with my friendship with him. I think its because we don't spend much time together I don't know. He is a good person but a pain in the ass, and he reminds me more and more of my father. Scary thoughts.<br /><br />Mom went to the doctors today too. And her visit wasn't as good as mine thats for sure. She went to see a specialist about her headaches, and found out that she has two fractured vertebrae at the top of her spine. Apparently this is something that everyone has known about from the beginning but her. The ER doctor who sent her to work the day after her accident, her doctor who has been seeing her since, and there is another doctor that she has been seeing. So now the headaches could be permanent, if the doctors had sent&nbsp;her to a surgeon before this it could of all be avoided. But not now, mom is seeing a surgeon today to see if they want to operate on her or not and if they do there is a very slim chance, but still a chance that she could become paralyzed from the neck down. Scary stuff, why couldn't the doctors have taken care of this earlier? So now the possibility of me moving to Florida is stronger than ever.&nbsp; I just have to wait to find out what happens. Also, on the 8th of November my Uncle Harold is having his surgery to have his tumor removed from his brain. Oh man I can't wait for this stage of life to be over honestly. I really can't.<br /><br />Financially I am doing ok barely, squeaking through. Something will even itself out at some point and hopefully I will be getting a part time job soon. I think this weekend I will go around and fill out a bunch of applications.<br /><br />Well time to get back to work.<br /><br /></strong></font></p>"

"event","<font color=""#cc6699""><strong>I am really getting frustrated with my financial situation. I am beginning to think that taking my trips to Florida and Maine weren't the best ideas, but how could I go much longer without connecting with the people I love? But I am paying for it now. As hard as I have tried to keep from spending my money I somehow have overdrawn my account. Not good. The only money I can take out is for my doctors appointment, and for doing my laundry. Thank God Geoff is letting me come over to do my laundry at his place or else it would cost me almost twice as much.<br /><br />This is really sickening, I hate being broke and trying to get things paid for. Not even 6 months ago when Geoff and I were together I had a savings account and was able to pay my bills on time, and I had a job that paid enough for me to live on. This is so hard, and its the having to get through until January. January, January. Can I hold out until then? I sporadically have been looking for a second job but it seems like I am going to have to get more serious about it. This part of my life I am beginning to hate. I enjoy working here, but the money isn't there and well as long as I can get through to being hired full time.<br /><br />I do have my Y membership, and I think thats what is going to be taking up my free time along with working on my cross stitch. And spending time with Kate, Claire, and Geoff. The rest of my life is just going to have to be put on hold. There is so much to do and I want to do. But until I can get my fiancnes in order there isn't anything I can do. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.<br /><br />So what is going on in the rest of my life, I have a life saver in Bard Richmond, he is hiring me as a nanny for next weekend. 16 hours at $16 an hour. I wish I was making $16 an hour now. This extra couple hundred bucks will be an immense help and may help enough for me to get my butt out of the hole for the end of this month and work on a budget for next month. I really need to sit dow nand work this out. Maybe save myself a huge headache. Because my head is beginning to throb with all of this bs.<br /><br />Other than this life is good, my friends are all happy and healthy, mom and dad are doing ok, mom has a doctors appointment today take care of some problems. Hopefully get the settlement they deserve. Everything rests on today and mom has been having headaches, and apparently the ""shakes"" which could be preliminaries to seizures. I am wondering if it would be good for me to move to Florida for a little while to help out if I can. Just to be closer, this is a very real realization that I am going to have to pack it all up and go there. I really don't want to, All of you know just how hard it is to deal with my parents, but I guess I have what is known as the good daughter syndrome.&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong></font>"

"event","Hey its Monday morning, when did this happen? I'm super tired right now. Though I can't seem to find the energy to go to sleep I think I am going to go upstairs and read Incubus Dreams for a little while. This hasn't been the best weekend. I mean its been alright, but for some reason I can't seem to shake the lonely feeling. Normally I do alright by myself, I tend to enjoy the quietness. Hell I look forward to it, when I get to come home and be the only person home. I really do hate having roommates, but that is another topic for another day. I talked to mom and dad earlier and knowing that I am going to be seeing them soon makes me feel wonderful. Its been almost a full year. They told me that yesterday was Harold and Alma's 44th wedding anniversary and Chris and Nat also got married yesterday. I'm happy for all people concerned, though I wonder why my relationships can't even make it to two years. I'm really missing my relationship with Geoff right now. Not the way it was these last few months, but how it was when we first got together and there was nothing but just the joy of being together. In the same vein I am also missing my early relationship with Hector, and even my summer with Frank. I sometimes wonder if my early mistakes are catching up with me. I was chatting with a guy last night from OkCupid, (Claire why did you ever get me on that thing and how the heck do I get off it?????) and he wasn't interested in conversation he was just wanting to know how to get into my pants, it really made me ill and it made me feel so dirty. I ended that conversation damn quick. I know I have mentioned getting a F*** buddy, but I can't. Claire says I finally grew out of that, thankfully. Jesus talk about at risk behavior. I don't miss sex, hell I enjoy it, but what I miss more than anything is the comfort of someone holding my hand or rubbing my back. Or just holding me close. Time heals all wounds right? So I guess just getting through this and being patient will heal all of this. Maybe instead of finding a fuck buddy I can find a cuddle buddy. 

On top of everything finally seeming to sort itself out, I have to have my lower wisdom teeth removed. Not my idea of fun, and thankfully I get free care from the state of MA. But I am now eligible to get health insurance from my work well my temp job. Its $33 a week which is fine with me. I need to get things checked out and procrastinating isn't going to help. But I wonder if its going to be a problem with my getting my wisdom teeth removed. Ugh to many problems. I am going to go to bed and read, and get some sleep. Hopefully I'll be able to breathe tonight, me and my allergies."

Geoff and his family are all in New York City for it and I was supposed to have been there to. But thanks to Geoff and his god damn change of heart, I am here watching the family pets, and taking care of his damn apartment. Bitter no...hurting yes. Especially since Geoff just called me to tell me that its a Jewish Wedding after all. I don't want to hear this. I don't want to hear about the wedding, I just don't want to know especially after we spent so many months speculating about it. This was the last major thing that we had planned before we broke up, and it hurts because I still don't understand why we broke up. I just don't get it, I haven't been able to understand. Affairs of the heart are what they are and we didn't make it. I understand my side of the break up I was tired of being hurt, but his side of it started way before that in April, and things seemed like they were going so well, and then they weren't because his feelings changed. Its been over a month now, and I'm still as confused as I was when he told me that he didn't feel that we had a future together anymore. 

Geoff said he is going to call me back after the ceremony which starts at 6. I'm debating whether or not to answer the phone. I just want to get over this, and maybe after this weekend I will be. I want to keep my mind off this, but its hard to when I am house/pet sitting for him and his mother while they are in New York. I would much rather be anywhere else than here right now. 

Why can't there be someone out there who wants to be with me, just as I am, and stay in love with me....I'm so tired of becoming friends with my exes."

"event","I am so tired, I couldn't sleep last night. I couldn't figure it out. But this one topic no this one word kept resonating in my head. ""Alienated"" Yep thats the word, and the subject of this posting. 

Almost two weeks ago, Geoff and I were hanging out and I asked him sarcastically, if his friend Jenn would actually meet me now that we are no longer together. And he replied that he didn't see why not as there was no way for her to feel alienated (obviously this is not a direct quote, but close enough). I laughed - and thought to myself - how the hell did she feel alienated? Since then that word has be going through my mind. I rarely get obsessed by anything, but I was furious in that moment, and realized that I was still mad at him. So I ended up writing him a 6 page letter, telling him why I was mad at him, and it was a very freeing, I literally felt the anger drain away. But something tripped me off again last night. And I realized that if Geoff ever decided that he wanted to get back with me, that I just can't do it. 

Because he alientated me from his life. I remember the day he told me that he was looking for rollerblading partners, and that he was going to meet Jenn. That was the day he drew the line between us, that I was not allowed to cross. If I had to choose a time when our relationship started to fail, it would be that day. I could not understand why he wouldn't want me to be a part of that section of his life. I still can't. But I no longer need to understand. I tried to cross that line time and time again. Then when I couldn't I tried to rationalize it and pretend it wasn't there. I spent so much time being angry and jealous of Jenn, and it had nothing to do with her at all. I couldn't understand why I was jealous and angry everytime he talked to her on the phone, hung out with her. Out of all the relationships I have been in this is the first time I have ever been jealous of my boyfriend hanging out with his female friends, and now I know why. Because I am not a jealous person, my behavior and reactions scared me. 

Obviously I have to wonder, because by his own admittance, that past girlfriends have had problems with him hanging out with his female friends. I wonder if he has drawn that invisible line with them as well. If Geoff is trying to find a woman that will accept this line being drawn in their relationship and being alienated from his life, well I highly doubt he is going to find her. And I am afraid that he is going to be unhappy in his relationships until he realizes what he is doing.

Personally I am amazed at myself right now, amazed that I am not crushed or devastated by this. Especially since I was trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with me, and it had nothing to do with me at all. I'm not ready to date yet, but I am still ok with me and I am ok with being with me. With all the shit that was going on, I wasn't able to recognize something so simple, and being in love, I would of done anything (within reason) to work things out in our relationship. But a relationship takes 2 and both have to be invested in it. The day that line was drawn, I believe I was the only one still invested in our relationship. 

I'm not mad at him, but at least I am not going to be letting him rent space in my head. I want to be friends, I care about him deeply, the only way you can care about someone that you were once in love with."

Peggy, my co-worker, says I am thinking too much and giving myself a stress headache. Which I find kind of funny since there isn't a whole lot giving me stress right now. Probably whats giving me the most stress is hearing about everyone else's relationships, and happiness, and honestly it hurts. Geoff and I have been broken up for two weeks today. And I am still very much in love with him. I love him and I am in love with him, why can't I win? It would be so much easier if I could just bring myself to get a ""friend"" and get Geoff out of my system. But I don't want to get him out of my system, and the thought of having another one of those ""friends"" is enough to make me feel sick to my stomach. Definitely want to leave that bull s*** behind me. I find myself being a little hopeful that Geoff and I will get back together someday, but honestly I am not holding my breath. When I am ready to start dating again, I will, I'm not going to wait around to see what happens life is way to short. But right now, all I want is to make some new platonic friends. People to hang out with. I can't wait for the internet to get hooked up at my place, and to get my new computer this week. I am definitely going to be looking for a bookclub to join or start, and just hopefully find people who I have things in common with.

Kate is coming over for dinner on Thursday and I am going to be making my curry chicken dish again. Its so yummy, I am going to try it with shrimp one of these days. Also, this weekend I am going to be baking cookies, I have a couple of recipes I want to try out. Pumpkin chocolate chip is the top of my list. Experimentation and learning all fun stuff.

My headache is starting to go away, maybe writing is what I needed. As long as the photocopier doesn't start running again I should be alright."

"event","Wow have things taken a turn for the better this past couple of weeks. I started working for the state of Massachusetts on July 31, and its a good job. I am really enjoying it the people here are wonderful, and though its a huge pay cut, at least I am not in the food and beverage industry anymore. Oh man that makes me so happy. I do a lot of billing and stuff, and today my boss finally gave me access to his calendar and contacts so I am doing a lot of administrative stuff.

Geoff and I broke up on August 1, and we're ok. We're remaining friends and so far so good. We've been hanging out and spending time together and just having fun. We went to Canobie Lake Park on Sunday and it was a blast. And then last night he came over for dinner and a movie, but we ended up falling asleep on the couch. So hopefully this weekend we will be able to catch up on the movies and just stuff in general. I miss him a lot, and I still love him very much. I am amazed that our transition to friendship has gone so smoothly. Though we have technically been broken up for months but neither one of us wanted to make it official. Its a huge relief for the two of us, there's no more tension, or frustration, and its wonderful being able to spend time together, without all of this crap hanging over our heads. 

My roommate Catherine moved in last week and she is completely awesome. So everything is looking up finally. About damn time!!!!"

"event","Well since my post on Monday I thought I should update my LJ because a lot of good things have happened since then.

1.) I got a job. I went through the temp agency Professional Staffing Group, and during the interview I got a placement that starts on Monday.
2.) I got my checks from Unemployment finally, and it came in at over a thousand dollars. Thankfully. I was able to pay two bills and I get to do some major grocery shopping soon. Food is a good thing.
3.) Geoff and I had a talk today and things are looking better. It could go either way with us honestly, but I feel that I am better prepared to handle our relationship issues than I have been these last few months. Either way things work out we're going to be ok.
4.) I'm moving again tomorrow, switching apartments. The people downstairs are moving up and I am moving down. I haven't felt that horribly towards my new place this week, but I have a feeling I going to be feeling a lot better being downstairs.

So there thats the update. I am going to continue to look for work, but I am going to take some time off from it for now. I need to let my mind and myself settle before I take on too much.

Thank you - all of you who have been so helpful and supportive, and letting me use your shoulders to cry on. You guys are amazing and I love you."

"event","I am sitting here at Geoff's dreading his homecoming and not because I don't want to see him. Far from it I can't wait for him to get home so I can cuddle up with him and show him my surprise. I found his watch that has been missing for over 2 weeks! No I am dreading his homecoming because that means I have to go back to my place and well I don't want to. I brought Precious and Mittens over here and they are sooo much happier here. Right now Precious is stretched out on the bed sound asleep and comfortable. Mittens has been running around and playing and cleaning Precious and Koona and its breaking my heart. At my place they are both sullen and hiding and avoiding and its depressing. The last two weekends I have been alone at Geoff's mothers house and here and I look forward to these quiet times, because I hate that apartment. I'm alone when I am here, but its  different. Its so different and when I am alone there I am the most miserable I have been in my life. And there has been a lot of shit happening to make my life miserable. And seeing how scared and miserable my lovely babies are makes it all worse. 

I hope that moving downstairs to the smaller apartment will be better. But I am not holding out a lot of hope for it. And the really sad part is that I wouldn't be happy there even if I was working right now. Ugh. And the really sad sad part is that there isn't any way that I would be happy in any place I moved into after living with Geoff. I miss him. 

So how does one define home. I feel more at home here than I have anywhere before. And sometimes that scares me. And I wonder if its a home to me because of Geoff... I love him so much and I can't imagine my life without him. What we are going through is difficult and sometimes it feels like the end of the world."

"event","Right now its Saturday and its been a crazy day that started around 2:00 p.m. yesterday and ended at 3:45 this morning and started up again at 8:45. UGH. 

Life which has recently been extremely depressing, and I mean deeply depressing is finally taking an upswing. I am not working yet, I am still broke beyond belief. But I had an interview today for a full time nanny position and I feel that the interview itself went well and hopefully I can get the job we shall see. The kids are pretty cool, and it requires light housework and cooking for the family. I have no problem with that 30 hours a week afternoon to evening, 3 weeks vacation per year, and health insurance. So I can work a morning job, and still have time to be with Geoff. I'll be tired, but this might work out.

I have three more interviews on Monday and Tuesday. One at PetCo don't think this one is going to happen, dog-grooming and my allergies not a good combination. The first one on Tuesday is at Emmanuel College for a Cafeteria Supervisor, definitely don't see this one happening either. Icky. Just the thought makes my skin crawl, I just got done working with high schoolers, college students can't be much better. The final one is for Barnes and Nobles at Kenmore Square. 5 floors and lots of books, retail. I think I can handle this and I can work it as either full time or part time. This one I see happening.

What else is there, oh there is the relationship stuff. Geoff and I went out on a date last night to Faneuil Hall's Comedy Connection to see Gary Gulman. This guy is hilarious actually all three comics were great, the girl April before Gulman, was so out there it was hilarious. I can't remember laughing so hard the openess of a woman making fun of sex and masturbation and anal, and my favorite joke about men going down on women and missing the ""spot"" and having to take a sharpie to mark it. Geoff leaned over at that point and asked me about it and I just had this little smile on my face. I love him so much. Though before this, after our spending a great day together of just relaxing and him rescuing me from my horrible horrible home. We ended up having a little spat, which ended up with me calling him a son of a bitch, and him apologizing profusely for using the wrong words and not explaining himself clearly. Yeah - don't come crying to me if you don't get the job, yeah wrong choice of words. Oh was I ripped shit, and he found that out pretty quickly. I understand that it/I have been difficult to deal with do to losing jobs and everything else going on. And he has a hard time dealing with me crying and there is nothing he can do to help me though I don't think he understands that him being there and holding me while I cry my eyes out is the best and most wonderful thing he can do. Sometimes I wish I wasn't so understanding and the other reason he got my forgiveness was he has been sick since Tuesday and has had a fever of a 101. And after the show we ended up in the Emergency Room last night until early this morning. And now he is at Foxwoods with some friends until tomorrow, and I miss him. I can't wait for him to come home tomorrow, so I can actually kiss him. I haven't been able to kiss him since Monday and it SUCKS!

I love him so much, he's just a pain in my ass sometimes and if he wasn't then I would be truly worried. Next weekend weather permitting or not we are hopefully going down to Marion for the weekend. Its going to be nice just to get away.

So there is my occasional blog about my life. Things are looking up, in both the relationship section and the career section. I'm tired and its alright. I'm in love with a wonderful man who while at Foxwoods has text me numerous times, just to let me know that he is thinking about me. I love him."

Wow, I am using both mine and Geoffs computers right now and my screen saver popped up I have all of my pictures set as a slideshow. And my favorite picture of Geoff just popped up. Its one of the first he sent me, its the one of him holding a baby gibbon. Looking at it, I remember telling him that I couldn't decide which one is cuter. Him or the Gibbon. Definitely him. Lol.

Its clouding up again, it seems like all it has done lately is rain, rain, and rain some more. Which is fitting with my mood. I have not been the happiest of people lately. I've been fired from Rosie's a bakery where I was working as an Assistant Manager. So I am leaving the Food and Beverage Industry. For good? I'm not sure but even though being unemployed sucks it feels good not to have to work in that environment. Quite frankly I really should be looking for a job right now.

I just read a bunch of live journals of my friends. And just a note about Jenn its amazing at how our lives are in almost a perfect paralell. Its almost scary. The issues we've been having with our guys. The insecurities. As much as I wish we were both stable, its nice having a little company to talk to about it all with. Men suck sometimes and yet they are wonderful beyond anything in this world. Like my day with Geoff yesterday was just great. Despite a few minutes of tension, all went well. Which is a wonderful feeling given how things have been between us the last few weeks.

Quite frankly I don't want to move. But I am excited about moving as well. Its another chapter in life, and well this time I hope it works. Though its quite interesting on how I always end up moving or having to move when I am broke. It doesn't make it easy thats for sure. 

Despite how messed up things are I am happy with my life. Ironically. This is just a mild bump in the road one of lifes little tests. And I am sure that I will pass with flying colors."

I just got off the phone with Hector and I haven't felt this good in a few days. I needed his cool sense of making things right. One of the things I cherished during our relationship and our frienship previous to that. I have let too much stuff get into my head. Especially from mom and dad, as always. I am thinking of getting back into therapy. I am not perfect and speaking with psychologist might help me deal with stuff that I had thought that I had already dealt with. Guess what I haven't. Nothing new there. 

I'm tired, so tired and frustrated and I need to write more later, I don't think I want to ruin this good mood."

"event","Tonight was fun, I went and saw the movie United 93 with my friend Jay. Interesting movie, though I am thinking Flight 93, which was a made for television movie based on 9/11 is much more emotional. But that movie was portrayed through the eyes of passengers whereas this one comes from the views of the people who were trying to figure out what the hell was going on.

But on my way downtown I called mom and dad. Yay for free weekend minutes. And they asked me how my new job is going. Quite frankly, its very annoying. Because I am totally not satisfied with what I am doing. Dad says that I won't ever be satisfied with what I am doing until I own my own business. But I don't think that is true either. I have been wondering about my choices for a career a lot lately more so than in the past. I know I am not happy doing what I am doing I get tired of it very easily. Somedays I wish I could go back to Bar Harbor and work for Lou again - despite personal issues that is the one place where I was satisfied with my work. It was simple direct and creative all at the same time. All I had to do was prep, plate two hundred or so appetizers, salads, and desserts, clean up and call it a night. Boom ba da bing. Done. Now I feel like even that would be too much to handle. But I honestly can't help but wonder if dad might be right. Or if getting my Masters Degree would be the right choice. Or if I have made any right choices concerning my career. Its not that I expected to be further along, its that I expected to be happier with my career choice than what I am. Hope and Rhonda have asked me time and again why I don't go back to school, for journalism, which is what I wanted to do in the first place. Rhonda even asked me when we were up there a couple of weeks ago. I love working with the people and I love helping make everything special for their special day - being part of something that I never thought I really had a chance at until I met Geoff. 

I can't wait for Geoff to get home he has to wait for the shuttle to take him from point a to point b since the train is being worked on. Its been worked on for the last three Saturdays. How annoying. He went to shoot some pool with his friend Jenn and they stopped to see a show together. I just wish he were home. This whole thing about my career has me thinking to much and I need some distractions. Unfortunately Penny doesn't cut it. Even though she is an adorable puppy. 

So to you my friends - what do you think? Be honest with me. Be brutally honest, it might piss me off, it might make me want to call you and yell at you. But I won't. My mind is so muddled right now about my future it is almost depressing. I am happy with every aspect of my life expept this. If you ask me what I am passionate about - food is top of the list obviously. But this is also coming from someone who was a binge eater through out her childhood. Ugh I don't know and my head is going to explode! I know you guys can't tell me what to do, but some advice, criticism, thoughts, anything at all would certainly be welcome."

"event","<P>Christmas is over....time to breathe a huge sigh of relief. In comparison to past Christmases this was definitely one of the best ones that I have ever had. Though getting woken up early by Livia knocking on the door to open presents . . . .this must be a preview of what it is like to have children.&nbsp;I got some pictures so those of you who read this regularly keep your eyes peeled as there will be some pictures coming your way soon. Yesterday was also the first day of Chanukkah. My first Chanukkah. It was very nice and very homey and simple. Livia lighted the Menorah with her Uncle and they sang the blessing together. After that it was on to more presents. As I am not Jewish myself the last thing I expected was to be fully integrated into the tradition, but Geoff's Aunt and Uncle (Pat and Norman) gave me a beautiful lavendar candle which is going to be going in Geoff's and my new kitchen. We finished off the day at China Sky for dinner and it was yummy. Last years Christmas while not the best wasn't exactly horrible either, with mom and dad in Florida and Hector came out and spent the night. Supposed to have been on the living room floor on the air mattress instead we ended up sharing the bed. I didn't sleep I was so uncomfortable. This year, was beyond wonderful the only thing missing was my own family. I miss them a lot and find that I miss them more now than I have in a very long time. Maybe it was the visit in October, or who knows. I certainly don't.</P>
<P>So here it is the day after Christmas, I'm at work and its quiet which is nice and I am spending time in reflection of the past years, as I have a tendency to do every year. It seems to me that after a certain age Christmas just loses its charm and excitement it becomes a holiday of blah blah blah. Well this one was definitely different as we sat and watched Livia opening her presents, I can't remember the last time I laughed so much at Christmas. It was great, I&nbsp;am going to go to CVS after work today and see if I can't make some copies of the pictures I got on my camera to frame. Geoff and I both want to frame the one of us together at his place, and the one with us and Livia is just great. I'm going to put that one here in the frame at work. </P>
<P>So news on the move. The closing date for 22 Fairfax St is January 11, 2006. On Wednesday we have the home inspection and that should go pretty smoothly depending on nothing freaky happening. And as&nbsp;of Wednesday I am giving Josh my notice for&nbsp;February first. I&nbsp;would&nbsp;give it&nbsp;to him now, but I want to make sure&nbsp;everything is going to work out ok with the home inspection, I really don't want to find myself without&nbsp;a home. Though&nbsp;Geoff says I could move into his mom's place if things go awry, I'm sure&nbsp;Lois would be thrilled about that. I know that she isn't a hundred percent supportive of&nbsp;Geoff and I living together as it is.</P>
<P>Some more good news is that my cell&nbsp;phone is back on. I need to make so many phone calls. Jenn, Mel, my parents, just everyone and the things I need to get done at home. Whew. I am glad that my schedule isn't as insane as&nbsp;last weeks that for sure. I will be able to get some sleep this week&nbsp;</P>

"event","Well if any of you read the beginning of the weeks entry, I was so not in a good place. I was tired, frustrated, and just didn't know what to do concerning my finances and it made me feel like a complete loser. I am trying hard to stick to the budget that Claire had helped me with but wit the lack of money to put towards the budget, the percentages were not working. I need to maintain an income of at least $1,400 a month and right now I am barely clearing a $1,000. What is it with catering business that I love the job I am in but I can never seem to get enough hours in the day or have enough work to do within those hours. I hope that is going to change soon. I applied for a second job on Thursday and had the interview yesterday and hopefully today or tomorrow I will know if I got the job or not. I am keeping my fingers crossed. 

Other than that life is going good. I am watching Penny run around outside in the new snow fall and she is just loving it. I love watching animals have fun in the snow. Geoff is still asleep upstairs, how he can sleep so much boggles my mind. Lois and Livia are out doing Livia's weekend schedule. That little girl has a tighter schedule than I do but she seems happy doing things and has free time to do as she wants when she is at home. Though she is a little spoiled, but show me what kid isn't? 

So despite some early anxiety this week things are looking up and no matter what I am going to end up on top and know that Geoff and I are going to be moving in together soon. So lets see how things pan out financially. And I am not going to worry myself about it too much more."

"event","I am sitting here in Needham and the last two days have left me feeling, I am not sure if its exhausted, no not exhausted but feeling kind of let down. And its not because of anyone else that I am feeling this way its because of me. My mind feels like its going a hundred miles a minute and I am frustrated since I can't seem to make heads or tails out of what is happening right now. I am the happiest I have ever been but I have this cloud of doom hanging over my head. And it all has to do with money. Money Money. Goddamn pieces of shit paper that have zero meaning beyond what people give it.

I have ten dollars left to get me through till Thursday and its more frustrating than ever now. I feel like crying my eyes out I feel so bad because of this. I may not have the most perfect job in the world but I don't want to have to find another one so soon. I hate that I can't seem to get myself out of the low end jobs that are the part of where I am. I have so many more skills then this. Jesus Christ Stefanie has bought herself a fucking mustang. I am not sure on how successful my other classmates are but I can almost guarantee that they are doing better than I am. I often find myself regretting my decision to go to NECI or even being in this business. Granted I am doing well for myself, but at the same time I am barely squeaking by. Today, today I went with Geoff and his mom to look at the places he wants to potentially buy. The one on Summer St is gorgeous if a little unconventional and the one that is out a little ways further is even nicer I think - except for the green bathroom. When Lois was talking to Steve the broker about a couple of things, I felt myself being insulted by a couple of her comments. 1) Cheap - in regards to formica counter tops and 2) No taste, when it came to vinyl siding. I wanted to ask her if its cheap when you can barely afford it, and how is vinyl siding no taste when its a huge step up from roof shingles on the side of the house? I know she is really trying to get the best for the money and that she coems from an entirely different life than I do. Thats not a problem, but she also needs to remember that it isn't in bad taste or cheap. In fact the formica is somewhat more suitable for a kitchen, granite in the kitchen would be wonderful but it isn't a necessity. I am finding that it doesn't matter to me what the house looks like that is really up to Geoff. But what I saw with each of those places we were looking at and I asked myself in everyone of them...Can I call this home? Can I be happy living here with Geoff. And honestly these two places were the only ones that in my mind were Yes to both questions. Then I find my mind drifting - Geoff and I have agreed that I will pay the utilities. No problem it will be a hell of a lot cheaper than rent! Except in the case of heating oil in the winter, but if he is willing to help out on that then it will be alright. But for me its going to be a fight as always to keep things financially balanced. 

What is bringing on all of this is that my student loans are off of forebearance, and they are now 30 a month cheaper than my rent! Hence the reason that once again I need to find another job. You think that after all of the changes I have made in my life it would be easy to just pack it up and move to another job and to another house. But this time it isn't easy. I have already uprooted my life so many times to make it better and it seems like that just putting a band aid on it and its falling off, and it keeps falling off and nothing is getting better it feels like it is only getting worse and worse and worse. And I want more than anything to move in with Geoff and live with him and be happy ever after, but how can it be happy ever after if I am always broke trying to put my life together. Why must I always try to put my life together this is just bullshit. I am tired of fighting with money and have bill collectors call me and I can't seem to get myself out of debt. I can't seem to keep things from getting worse. Maybe they have to get worse before they get better. I dunno. I am so sick of this. 

I have to remember, I am crossing the boundries into the more sophisticated side of the world, and I hope that I can survive in it."

"event","Its 11:30 and I need to take a shower soon. I spent the afternoon/evening with Geoff we went to Mulans in Cambridge for Taiwanese Food and we are so going back! The food there was excellent. I can't remember the last time I had such great Asian food and the server there was realy nice as well. We came back and Geoff went to sleep the poor guy was so exhausted. Livia had a friend over and the energy in the house was high. I called my parents and had to tell my dad that the phone battery was dying because I just couldn't take one more instant of hearing about the Union that is going to take over at his job. He and I have two very different opinions on Unions. They are good for something and not others. But if it makes his professional life easier then its a good thing. 

Though an interesting thing at dinner happened. Geoff and I both ordered spring rolls which came as an order of 4. We got into this dispute because the waitress brough my order out, and Geoff thought it was two orders of two instead of two orders of four. We had a bit of a tete a tete about this and the waitress also said that it was two orders of two. I asked to see the menu and showed them both that it was 4. After this she went and put in the second order, and Geoff said maybe it was something else probably the eggrolls that were an order of 2. I was only half expecting an apology at this point, so when he said that. I kinda smiled and thought to myself oh shit. So far this is his only character flaw, can't admit when he is wrong. I can live with this, but at some point its going to cause a fight, and that will spice things up a little bit.

Its so dark and dreary out, but this afternoon should be intesting. I am going to a lot of Open Houses. The prospect of moving in together is definitely happening. We were talking in bed last night after the lights were out and Geoff told me that he loves me more than he has ever loved anyone before. And I told him that its the same for me and he's like really? And I told him, I wouldn't be looking at houses with you otherwise. We both laughed at that. I do love him, flaws and all. No one is perfect, but he is perfect for me thats for sure."

"event","What is it about kids that they can just melt your heart with a word? Or make you laugh by being silly. I am so close to tears right now because Livia told me that she loved me and wants me to watch her every night. Monday Tuesday, and Wednesday, and Thursday, and Friday! What I wouldn't give to have this kind of innocence back in my life. But I do have this kind of innocence, thanks to a wonderful 8 year old little girl. I will be sad the day that she becomes jaded to the realities of the world. 

Livia is such a great girl. Energetic and just full of warmth, and wanting to play. We watched Zooboomafo and acted out the characters along with the tv. She read Disneys ""Scamp"" and ""101 Dalmatians"" to me, and then when she went to bed, I read her two Curious Georges. I can't remember the last time I read Curious George. I wonder if Paddington Bear is still around?

Geoff and I are planning a trip to China Town this weekend. It should be a lot of fun, though my paycheck was really small this week Only 491 bucks and then there was the problem with overdrawn checks, and I still have to pay rent so spending to much money just isn't going to be happening for a couple more weeks. Though I do need to get a hat, scarf, and mittens for this winter. Also I am going to start taking the train to work more often and home as well. Its just a little nippy that early and the route 66 bus is not reliable at anytime of day.

I am so happy. I feel like my heart is going to break. And in the list of questions when it says ""what do you have"" and I replied with everything. The truth is I have more than everything."

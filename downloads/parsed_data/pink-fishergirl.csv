"event","Well the weather seems to be changing finally... So is pretty much everything else it seems. May 22nd my work closes down completely for almost three weeks until June 9th. Once we re-open we will  be strictly food to-go, catering, and business lunch delivery. We are also trying to get into catalog sales for a lot of our homemade desserts and we hope that really takes off. No breakfast, no tables or chairs, no sitting down at a table and being a demanding customer any longer. Did that last part sound bitter of me?

Weird.

Anyway, it isn't because we can't pay the bills or can't compete any longer... Really quite the opposite. Our catering has expanded so much that it is hard to run the front deli and finish catering jobs at the same time. Besides the fact that ALL of us are completely burned out from running a busy restaurant. Anyway...we aren't closing FOR GOOD and it will certainly be a transition for everybody... The reason for that we are even closing for the three weeks is to sell all of the stuff we won't need anymore and remodel the space. The place has been for sale for awhile now... And no one is buying restaurants right now... Go figure eh? Otherwise we would have moved somewhere way smaller. That's just the way it goes though.

Anyway, I won't have full-time hours anymore once we reopen since we only be doing to-go food and catering so I'm searching high and low for new employment. Change is good right? I know everyone will miss Tres Cafe... What isn't to love about bread pudding?"

"event","I have been sick for TWO WHOLE WEEKS! It started out Sunday night into Monday morning with a stuffy nose and slight cough. By next Saturday when I thought I was getting better, I completely lost my voice. Only now have I pretty much regained my voice ONE WEEK LATER! I finally took cough syrup with hydrocodine so I could sleep through the night without coughing fits. The coughing fits along with my nose running every ten minutes really kept me from the sleep department. I'm still tired and sick but I finally think I can be done with the whole illness thing."

The Mariners won 5-4 even though the ninth hitter in the White Sox lineup hit a GRAND SLAM. The seats were great, only ten rows behind third base. We spent all day Saturday walking around Seattle shopping and it was the 100th year anniversary of Pike Street this weekend, so that was also really cool.

"event","I got the urge to clean my computer room today, and I actually have taken a good dent out of what I need to do, so I thought I'd take a break.

On June 7th, Tim and I had a friend die in a car accident while he was on his way to work at 6 in the morning. The last time we had really gotten to see him was on his wedding day, just eight months prior in September. At 24 years old, it seems pretty unfair. The fact that I drove in a car from Portland, Oregon all the way to Chicago, Illinois and back with nothing but one ticket and not even a dent in the car while Mike was just three miles from home on a street that he had driven on probably 1,000 times (I as well!) is something that is hard to shake. I suppose it is just hard to wrap your head around something like that. It will just never be fair.

On a lighter note, I got all of my final grades and am done with college. Well, for the moment anyway. I have begun researching jobs that can earn me some money while I begin to apply for law enforcement positions. I have spent four years at Tres Cafe and it's time to move on I think.

It has almost been two full months of working out in the gym. If I'm not working out there, I am usually hiking or walking the logging road on my off days. I am up to three quarters of a mile on the treadmill at a pretty good pace without stopping, that is QUITE an accomplishment for me... I think I have begun to lose some of the weight, and I am definitely toning my body while actually having a good time. I am really excited to keep my exercise up, I feel really dedicated.

I guess besides that, that's my life at the moment. I can't believe it's nearly July...Everything just flies by now..."

"event","Thursday morning we left my house for Salt Lake City. As soon as we passed Pendelton, we began our climb into the mountains. We saw snow the entire way, but it had been plowed so the roads were dry. The first day was a 12 hour drive with the stops along way and it was dark when we finally got into Salt Lake. I didn't really realize how religious Utah is. Even their Dairy Queens are closed on Sundays. We stayed right downtown across from Temple Square which we dubbed ""Mormon Square"" because of the mass of people wearing skirts and suits leaving the church that sat right downtown. Watching their local morning show before I left in the morning, the news anchors laughed and mocked a recent scientific study about the beginning of our universe. You could hear in their voice that they just didn't believe in any science whatsoever.

Thankfully we left immediately after that. They could probably smell the sin on me. Our next resting stop was Denver, Colorado. St. Patrick's Day. We got in a little earlier this time, it was a shorter trip. After getting settled in, we went to a nice dinner since we had time and walked downtown. The downtown is so sprawling but it was dead quiet, even for a Friday party night. The bars were packed, the one bar we saw anyway. I decided to have a little Red Bull and Vodka on our balcony to celebrate the Irish.

The third day we ventured to St. Louis, Missouri. Our hotel sat next to the Mississippi river, and was one block away from the St. Louis Arch. We had another fantastic view, but it was a late night so I crashed soon after we got there. In the morning we walked across the street and took pictures of the arch. On our way back to the hotel we saw Bon Jovi's tour bus parked outside another hotel. I wanted to stay and accost him, but we had to go.

We drove across the Mississippi into Illinois for the last leg of our trip until we left Chicago. We stopped in Springfield to see Abraham Lincolns house and then his tomb. We finally got into Chicago and drove through the downtown to our hotel so we could see what it looked like. Portland is like Canby compared to Chicago. The buildings are so high it hurts your neck to look up. It took us 45 minutes to drive through it on a Sunday.

We however stayed in the third most affluent county in America. There were nothing but half million dollar houses lining the streets of towns. We had every restaurant you'd ever want, and their grocery stores sell hard liquor...for cheap. We got a fifty dollar bottle of vodka for twenty-five dollars. We took many trips back. 

The convention was fun. The resort was really nice, we got a quiet room away from everyone which was good because there were a LOT of people there. Our shooting team took second overall and we won a couple of awards. When we could get away, we went downtown. Our first trip we went to the John Hancock Building which is 94 floors up. Scary for me, because I despise heights. I drove the Magnificent Mile which was just insane. I have never seen so many people or cabs in my life. In Chicago, you drive with two things; the gas and the horn. It's a different place there. Our second trip we went to Geno's East which is world famous deep dish Chicago pizza. I could only eat one slice, and I didn't even finish it. We went to the Sears Tower which was 103 floors up, and drove through the South side of Chicago where Cabrini Green, the projects sit. We didn't dare stop because they tell tourists not to even go there because it's incredibly unsafe. Even the police refuse to go.

We finally left Saturday morning to stay in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. We stopped and left early the next morning. We went to Mt. Rushmore, which was probably one of my favorite things to see. There was snow everywhere so I got to play a little in it, which was nice because how often do we get it here?

Monday was a push. We drove 13 hours, and got in around 11:30 at night. I was exhausted but glad to be home. I had a blast, it's weird to be home now after everything I have seen, but there is still no place like it.

Last night I was driving home late on 99E. Some idiot was in front of me and would slow down in the other lane so I would barely pass him, then he would speed up and pass me again. A few minutes later he would slow down where I would barely pass, then pass me again. Finally he went barreling by me just as I got to South End road and I was glad he finally left me alone. It was after midnight and no one was on the road. When you come into Canby and it merges to one lane, he slowed down again. I didn't tailgate, but I was close, and as it got to one lane, he slammed on his brakes to a dead stop in the middle of the road just before you can turn right onto Territorial. I was tired and irritated beyond belief at this point so I just sat on my horn. I saw the dome light in the car turn on and a guy stepped out of his car with a wife beater on and tattoo's of crosses on his arm. He promptly asked ""What the fuck, asshole?"" with his fists clenched. I could not even believe what was happening...Being me of course I started yelling right back. I asked him what the hell he thought he was doing, I asked him if he was going to beat up a girl. I berated this poor kid because he obviously thought he was going to pick a fight with a guy. I continued to call him a fucking idiot and asked him if he really thought he was going to beat on a girl. At that point he got back in his car and I swerved around him, brake checked him, and then turn onto Territorial while he continued down 99E. I think I scared him...I'm sure he thought a guy would fight him, but when he saw I was a girl, I'm sure he thought I'd call the cops. The fact that he didn't follow me home makes me think he felt foolish. I hope he did. For once it was unprovoked on my part, there are just really crazy people out there.

Whew...Safe and sound though."

"event","I'm back down to a single job again. Jeremy, my boss at the tanning salon, just up and sold it, and when the new owner asked if I wanted to keep my job, I told him I wasn't really interested. I'm going to have to start interning somewhere come Spring for my degree, so I was going to quit anyhow. How nice it will be to have my Tuesday and Thursday evenings back, and to spend less on gas! Then again, if I'm not at work then I'll be using up my gas someplace else I suppose. 

Finally got done with my midterms this week. I got an 88% on my Substantitive Law midterm, which is unheard of for that class, so I'm proud of myself. Haven't gotten the grades to the others yet though. 

And lastly, I made my hotel reservations for Chicago. I'm excited."

I got...

-$300.00 cash
-Laguna Beach Season 1
-Clothes
-Earrings
-Pink trash can that's super cute
-Calender
-CDR Spindle

My birthday actually turned out well this year. Last year I was sick, my Mom forgot it was my birthday temporarily, I had to take a midterm, I went to breakfast and my order got lost and I had to wait FOREVER, I burned my hand, AND I had to do the dishes. This year? None of that, so I guess it wasn't too shabby.

So only 365 more days and I am 21. Sweet."

"event","I think that cars I touch fall apart. On the way to get my hair cut with my Mom, her car broke down on the side of I5. So of course that was a miserable experience. We had to call a tow truck to get the car to Canby Ford, where it's been sitting all day now. My Dad loaned her his car, and he's driving a work truck, so that all worked out, but I'm sure whatever the problem is, it will be expensive. That truck is very very dead.

On the topic of cars, I'm considering buying a 1997 Range Rover. I don't know the mileage on it yet, but it has brand new racing tires and leather interior. The stereo has an $1,800 face piece. It can be my young flashy car. I might sell my car and then end up paying the difference. I think the guy was going to sell it to someone else for $15,000 or so, but he said he'd take $10,000 from me. So who knows, we'll see what my parents say.

Planning on the Blazers game tonight, we shall see."

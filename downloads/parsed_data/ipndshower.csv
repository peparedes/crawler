then i went to my dad's house saturday and sunday and slept for like 2 days. and my stepmom made some really good cookies. and we planned our trip to Italy.

then sunday and monday i was at catherine's with her and emma and we tried to go to stupid stone mountain but the darn thing was closed so we had leaf races in the river and her brother thinks i have yellow feet.  

then we went to discover mills where i had no money and catherine and emma did so they got manicures and i played in the fountain with my fan.   and catherine wants a $300 chair for her birthday hint hint?

also, i burned my neck.  i was wearing my sterling silver heart necklace while i blow dried my hair and the necklace got really hot and it burned all the skin off my neck.  so i look like a leper.

"event","a couple of my friends both got me into astrology and today i was cleaning up my room and i picked up my Bible and papers were falling out of it so i was putting them back in and the first page i opened up to was about astrology.  Isaiah 47:12-15 says  ""Disaster will fall upon you,and you will not know how to conjure it away.  A catastrophe you cannot foresee will suddenly come upon you.  Keep on then with your magic spells and with your many sorceries, which you have labored at since childhood, Perhaps you will succeed, perhaps you will cause terror. All the counsel you have received has only worn you out!  Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make predictions month by month, LET THEM SAVE YOU FROM WHAT IS COMING UPON YOU!  Surely they are like stubble; THE FIRE WILL BURN THEM UP.  They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame.  Here are no coals to warm anyone; here is no fire to sit by.  That is all they can do for you-those you have labored with and trafficked with since childhood.  Each of them goes on in his error; there is not one that can save you.""


if you wanna read more about astrology and magicians read Daniel 2:1-50  its about how king Nebuchadnezzar ordered the magicians and astrologers ans enchanters to interpret his dream for him but he would not tell them the dream, they had to do it themselves.  they could not do it and the the king ordered them dead .  Daniel prayed to God and asked to interpret the dream and he could do it with God but no man can do it alone and he saved the magicians and enchanters and wise men and astrologers."

"event","well, i had my birthday party last saturday.  it was really cool and i got lots of presents.  then when i got home i was opening them and it was all nice & good until my mom woke me up at 4 in the morning and told me my parents' best friend died of a heart attack.  so the rest of the week until wednesday was spent planning the funeral. the funeral was really sweet, my stepdad spoke for hapf an hour about his friend for 27 years.  the funeral procession was so nice, there were probably 150 motorcycles and 150 police cars. (he was a police-officer)  and i was feeling very antisocial the rest of the week.

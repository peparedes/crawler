"event","Today I got something interesting in the mail.  I'm sure she knows what I'm talking about.  How many more nails are you going to drive into my soul?  You already stole my soul, my heart, and who I am.  You took everything inside of me and kicked me to the curb.  

Do you know what got me through those 4 days of hell in the hospital?  The thought of you (I took a picture of you with me) and the hope that when I got better and released that there would be some form of correspondence from you when I got home.  But there was no such thing.  Over the next week I spent days waiting outside for your arrival.  I kept my cell phone on throughout the night hoping you would atleast call.  Every day I went to my P.O. Box atleast twice to see if there would be a letter.  But there was nothing.  Just the hole inside of myself left by you.

I thought I could save you.  I thought that was all you were waiting for.  Was someone to unconditionally love you and to be there for you.  I was even stupid enough to think that maybe I went through all the crap in my life for a reason.  It was meant to be.  I was kept alone and hurting so that when I finally found you that I could more fully appreciate and love you.  There was no doubt in my mind that that was the reason I've had the life I've had.

You were my everything.  I would have done anything for you.  I meant every word I ever told you.  That's why I came over that Thursday night.  I told you before that I would NEVER leave you or give up on you, and I meant it.  You told me the same thing.  That you would never leave me.  That we would be together forever.  Apparently that was just pillow talk on your behalf.  You only meant it in the safety of your room with the door closed, and the minute things get uncovered you flop on yor belly and going slithering back to him.


I've come to the conclusion that you deserve the life you have now.  Even on the last day we spent together,  you layed next to me and whined and cried about how you feel your entire life has been a waste.  And you refuse to do a fucking thing about it.  Maybe you think it makes you ""cool"" or ""goth"", I don't know, but it's pathetic.  You haven't done one fucking thing to change anything.  You are a 30 year old woman who wants to go through life acting like a 16 year old girl just sitting around complaining and writing little entries about how awful you feel, and you could care LESS about who's life you destroy on the way.  ""WA WA WA WA Kathryn left me, Becky left me, etc etc!"".  Your big complaint is that you feel alone.  You think everyone leaves you, and than you finally had someone 100% devoted to you.  I was ready to spend the rest of my life with you.  I wanted nothing more than to undo the damage other people had done to you.  It's nice to know that along with those other people you supposedly care SOOO much for that in a few years I'll barely be worth a paragraph in your revised LJ life story. 

You don't have a clue about what it feels like to be dead inside or to be truly alone.  You've always had other people there to pamper and control you like a little puppy dog so you don't have to lift a finger to do a fucking thing.  That's why you're still with him.  You may despise and hate him, but hey!  He has a projector TV and is willing to treat you like the child you wish to be.  The definition of a shallow and heartless bitch.  Sure, you may be depressed, but you think that's better than being happy through effort.    

DOn't use your kids as an excuse.  You are still there soully for yourself.  Because it's comfortable.  You don't have to do anything there except what you do best; lie.  Your entire life is built on lies.  Even you yourself is a lie.  After everything that's happened you'll still go on like you always do.  Smiling at bullshit church meetings, baking your pies, going to little family outings, talking about ""networking"" and all the wonders of your godly life.  Than maybe in a few years you'll get bored again than sucker someone else into being your fuck-toy for 9 months, than kicking than to the curb when the acts up.

And the worst thing of all this is that I still love you.  I despise myself for it, but I am still madly in love with you.  So while I sit here and destroy my life over you, you go back to normal being Ms. little happy pastor wife without giving me or my heart a second thought."

I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car, I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick, it even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right, I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. 

But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.

</lj-cut>

I love you even more than I did a week ago.  I am not mad at you.  Not at all.  I've tried to be upset.  I've tried to be angry.  But I can't do it.  Any of those feelings get overwhelmed by how much I love you."

My arm hurts a lot now.  I think I need to go into the hospital to get stitches.  It won't stop flowing in the middle one.

Chuck Norris once visited the Virgin Islands. They are now known simply as The Islands..

If Chuck Norris is late, time better slow the fuck down.

Chuck Norris is not half cherokee indian, cherokee indians are half chuck norris

Not only did Chuck Norris lose his virginity before his father, but the dinosaurs looked at him wrong. ONCE!

Chuck Norris died ten years ago, but the Grim Reaper can't get up the courage to tell him.

Superman owns a pair of Chuck Norris pijamas.

Chuck Norris doesn't age....... he floats in a perpetual state of ass kicking

Chuck Norris doesn't have hair on his testicles...because hair...doesnt grow on steel

Chuck Norris uses a nitelight not because he is scared of the dark, but because the dark is scared of him.

Chuck Norris' roundhouse kick can shut a revolving door.

When asking Chuck what time it is he says ""2 secs till"" when you say 2 secs till what he roundhouse kicks you in the face

Chuck Norris's tears cure cancer to bad he never crys

Chuck Norris is not hung like a horse. Horses are hung like Chuck Norris.

Chuck is the only person that can beat a wall in tennis.

Chuck Norris is the reason why Waldo is hiding.

In 1967 Steven Hawking became the first and only man to outsmart Chuck Norris............He learned his lesson

chuck norris played a game of russian roulette with a fully loaded gun, by himself and won.

If Chuck Norris found out about this bulliten he would delete the internet

Chuck Norris was the fourth Wiseman. He brought baby Jesus the gift of ""beard"". Jesus wore it proudly to his dying day. The other Wisemen, jealous of Jesus' obvious gift favoritism, used their combined influence to have Chuck omitted from the Bible. Shortly after all three died of roundhouse kick related deaths.

When Chuck Norris grew tired of masturbation, he removed his own rib and woman was created.

When Chuck Norris chops down a tree, he uses the wooden end of the axe.

When Chuck Norris goes to the movies his friends call him him Fire!!! because it is safer than saying Chuck Norris in a crowd.

Contrary to popular belief, Mary was not a virgin. Chuck impregnated her and the result was a bearded man named Jesus that could walk on water and turn stone into bread. He could not, however, throw a proper roundhouse kick. Chuck abandoned them and denied that Jesus was his son by proclaiming that Mary was a virgin. Everyone listened, because he is Chuck Norris.

Chuck Norris cannot be duplicated. If you try to duplicate Chuck Norris he will duplicate you. This is for the sole purpose that he can have the pleasure of killing you twice.

Chuck Norris' face grew from his beard and his body followed shortly after.

Christopher Reeves wasn't riding a horse when he was paralyzed. He tried to shake Chuck Norris' hand. The infusion of the Holy Ghost, Beard, and Chuck Norris Man Musk twisted Reeves' neck into numerous contortions until it snapped. Then Chuck transformed into a Black Stallion, carried him to the nearest hospital, and roundhouse kicked him into a dumpster because he wasn't really Superman

Contrary to popular belief, Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, and Heart can actually combine. However, it is not Captain Planet that materializes out of thin air to stop ecological disasters from destroying our fragile planet, it's Chuck Norris dressed in full jungle camouflage with an uzi and a flamethrower.

After reading the Letters to the Editor in his local newspaper, Chuck Norris became enraged at the fact that Richard Dean Anderson was considered sexier by women in the coveted 65+ demographic. To increase his sex appeal to older women, Chuck Norris tried to build a Missle Defense System out of a tube of chapstick, six rubber bands, a spork from KFC and a copy of Sports by Huey Lewis and the News. This soon became the prototype for the Total Body Gym Workout Machine.

Chuck Norris's girlfriend once asked him how much wood a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood. He then shouted, ""HOW DARE YOU RHYME IN THE PRESENCE OF CHUCK NORRIS!"" and ripped out her throat. Holding his girlfriend's bloody throat in his hand he bellowed, ""Don't fuck with Chuck!"" Two years and five months later he realized the irony of this statement and laughed so hard that anyone within a hundred mile radius of the blast went deaf.

Once, Chuck Norris sneezed so hard that he created the leap year.

Around 1pm I'm going back to the tattoo shop to help someone re-felt a pool table than we'll maybe play a few games afterwards.  Should be there for a few hours.

Also, tomorrow I will finally be getting in a game of Warhammer Fantasy. :)
Got an e-mail from a friend (Trekkie to some) and said he wanted to get in a game at the Gameroom sometime on Sunday.
All I have to do is go over to my friends house where I'm holding my army and pick it up.  I'll swing by later this afternoon.  Time to kill me some dwarves.  O;)"

Not much is going on tomorrow.  I don't work in the morning which is a relief.  I'm going to try and take it easy for most of the day.  Since Sunday afternoon I've been laboring non-stop.  Working from 9am-3pm at work than going over to my friends studio to help out from 4pm-11pm-ish.  I feel very drained at the moment and will enjoy my day off tomorrow."

You like things edgy, subtle, and smart. I guess that means you're
probably an intellectual, but don't take that to mean pretentious. You
realize 'dumb' can be witty--after all isn't that the Simpsons'

"event","Last night I saw one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It's called Hostage <a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hostage/"">(Describes the movie well)</a>.  It was a Bruce Willis film, and his films are usually a hit or miss, but this one sounded really promising on the box.  I usually check online to see reviews before I rent or buy a movie, but I didn't this time.  I will never make that mistake again.  It was literally like watching something fall apart in front of my eyes.....

Also, I must comment on this season of Miami Ink <a href=""http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/miami-ink/miami-ink.html"">(Official site)</a>.  I have become disappointed with this show.  The first season was awesome.  It had none of the bullshit that other tattoo shop shows have *cough* INKED *cough*.  It was really about the art and work of tattooing, and about running a new shop.  It was a tattoo lovers tattoo show.  Season 2 has not been such a show.  It's like the tattooing itself has taken a backseat to their personal drama.  A few weeks ago an entire show was dedicated to how one of the artists partys too much, and blah blah blah.  Another episode spent 15-20 minutes following the story of one of the artists and his long range wife, and how she was whining about moving to Miami and more blah blah blah.  Another episode spent two whole segments on how this guest artist chick wanted to get a fake gold tooth (yes, a gold tooth) and followed her when she got the tooth, and followed her back to the gold toothy hut when she decided it looked like crap and she wanted it taken out.  It's sad that such a good show seems to be going down the toilet...."

Introspective and reflective, you think about everything and anything.
You are a soft-hearted daydreamer. You long for your ideal life.
You love silence and solitude. Everyday life is usually too chaotic for you.

Given enough time alone, it's easy for you to find inner peace.
You tend to be spiritual, having found your own meaning of life.
Wise and patient, you can help people through difficult times.

At your worst, you brood and sulk. Your negative thoughts can trap you.
You are reserved and withdrawn. This makes it hard to connect to others.
You tend to over think small things, making decisions difficult.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whattempermentareyouquiz/"">What Temperment Are You?</a></div>

Very true.... Especially the part about the brooding and sulking.  I cant tell you all how many times I will take small, meaningless details, obsess about them, and turn them into big huge deals that are 99% of the time something negative.

Interesting.  This will probably shake some neo-conservatives up.  Democracy is not a fix-all; it's a device.  It gives people the oppurtunity to chose, but that choice isn't guaranteed to be a pro-American or pro-freedom choice.  A tyrant can be just as easily elected as an Abe Lincoln."

"event","I just finished Malcolm Gladwells ""Blink"".  It was an interesting book.  It's basically about Rapid Cognitive thought (or intuition-instinct) and how our perception of it is wrong.  His idea is that rapid cognition isn't just a gut feeling or an emotional reaction, but real <i>thought</i> that has taken place but just on a faster and subconscience level.  He believes that we are wrong in viewing that as a problem, and it is actually a blessing and something we should embrace.  That's basically what the book is about.  I'm not sure if I agree with his hypothesis or not.  Need to think on it more.

I also finished John Julius Norwich's ""A History of Byzantium"".  Although I think I had posted that a few months ago on the day I planned on finishing, but I never got to it and since forgot about it.  But now it IS actually done. :)

I'm also about half-way through Robert Jordan's ""Eye of the World"" and it's turning into a good book.  The only problem is that the main character Rand is annoying me.  He seems like such an idiot.  I greatly prefer Lan, the Sorceress' bodyguard.  I keep hoping that he'll kill Rand while he sleeps and take over the story, but I keep getting disappointed :D"

"event","Made an interesting purchase today.  I took a bunch of old cd's I never listen to anymore (stuff like Zao, Pearl Jam etc etc) and some old PS1 and PS2 games to Cd Warehouse for an exchange.  I didn't figure I'd get a lot of money for them, but I got more than expected.  I got a copy of Xenosaga Episode 1 for the PS2, Pride Fc for the PS2, and I got Secret Window and A River Runs Through it on DVD.  Made out much better than I expected. :)"

"event","Has anyone read the Celestine Prophecy?<br />It's god-awful terrible.<br />The Secret is nothing more than the Celestine Prophecy marketed as a self-help book.<br /><br />It is a cognitive failure to examine either of these books/movies and conclude that the claims made in the publications are somehow valid. There is a massive failure stemming from an over-reliance on deductive logic starting with false pretenses as axioms.<br /><br />The Celestine Prophecy is a piece of fiction that has been touted as containing ""truths"" about reality, without literally claiming to contain truths. It has relied on the incredulity of its fans to create a philosophy based on misconception, an unjustified and spiteful rejection of the scientific method (scientists/use of science != science), and fear disguised as hope. It is childish and fantastical. <br /><br />The Secret is a massive self-help scam. It's purely delusional. It makes claims but fails to back up those claims, presents untruths about quantum physics and the nature of energy (which, in reality, is defined as ""the capacity to do work""). It's distasteful.<br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper""><br />Karl Popper</a> --&gt; see his work on falsifiability<br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"">Inductive Logic</a><br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning"">Deductive Reasoning</a><br /><br />New-age crystal healing polly-ana-hippy tripe:<br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy"">Logical Fallacy</a><br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy"">Informal Fallacy</a><br /><br /><br />People don't like to be told they cannot understand something. It's true, some people won't be able to understand some things. The real truth is that reality is incredibly complex, and understanding parts of it require a substantial amount of dedication and effort. The Celestine Prophecy and The Secret provide a soma, an ""opiate for the masses,"" which soothes, reassures, and deceives. Science is not interested in the pursuit of ""truth."" Science acknowledges that truth may not be knowable, going so far as to assert that it cannot be demonstrably known. This is disconcerting for people, who already fail to understand science as a philosophy or method, and they react predictably as anyone would against being lumped outside of a group of ""elitists."" They feel excluded, rightfully, but what right do they have to actually be included? I don't understand tons, I have no problem deferring to someone who understands more than I do. I would like to know more, but I understand that this does not come easy. Authority must be demonstrated, so that ones authority is not drawn from oneself (the perceived notion of authority), but from the demonstrable nature of the knowledge behind the authority.<br /><br />Creationists, crystal healers, homeopaths, chiropractics, scientologists all subvert the authority and esteem of the scientific method (already unduly, but perhaps more justly, applied to the scientists themselves). <br /><br />If you can listen to the argument behind creationism, and truly understand the flaws in logic, the presentation of false axioms/pretenses, or any other number of things wrong with the concept, you should be able to do the same to things such as the Secret, or the Celestine Prophecy. Unfortunately, I can think of a handful of people who simply cannot.<br /><br />The Dark Ages came from a reasonable reaction against an elite who misused their position and perverted the authority of intellectuals, but it spawned an unreasonable rejection of the principles of a hierarchy of knowledge or accuracy (god forbid 3 be more than 2). People wanted a Universe that they controlled, after living for centuries at the behest of prophets, seers, and other archaic anthro-deities. Unfortunately, what you want cannot change the nature of the Universe. Thinking more positively may lower your blood pressure, it may improve your capacity to deal with crises, and it may also enable you to take risks with high benefit. A small caveat, if you will: Risks with high benefit often come with high, for lack of a better word, risk. Optimistic thinking should be tied to realistic thinking. In the same way that overly-pessimistic thinking is unrealistic and harmful, an over-assessment of ones capabilities, standings and assets will lead one similarly into ruin. Proceed with a realistic and critical attitude. Don't keep your head in the clouds, buried in the sand, or staring at your feet. Keep both feet on the ground, but don't be afraid to jump, run, and climb. Look all over, search everywhere, just don't expect to get anywhere without exerting any effort.<br /><br />Fun reading for anyone interested: <br /><a href=""http://www.gibson-design.com/philosophy/Aristotle-Organon-3-prior.1.i.htm"">Aristotle </a><i><a href=""javascript:void(0);/*1175047149677*/"">Organon</a> </i>(incredible over-reliance on ancient authority)<br /><a href=""http://www.constitution.org/bacon/nov_org.htm"">Francis Bacon <i>Novum Organon</i></a> (from <i>the Magna Instauration</i>, modern science and rational empricisim stems from Bacon's work)<br /><br />Fun links for anyone interested:<br /><a href=""http://skepdic.com/"">Skeptic's Dictionary</a> (more of a forum populated by self-proclaimed skeptics. The irony/punchline: approach this website...skeptically!)<br /><a href=""http://www.randi.org/"">James Randi Educational Foundation</a> if you don't know who James Randi is, then you should know that he is a pimp.<br /><br />In summation:<br /><br />Skeptical thinking is not ""science is right/alternative new age philosophy is wrong."" Science typically scores higher in credibility, reflection of reality, accuracy, predictability, etc. than ""alternative"" knowledge. The scientific method accurately and honestly admits its reach as well as limits, and is centered around the concept of rational empiricisim, falsifiability, and valid logical reasoning.&nbsp; Alternative/New Age mysticism, like much ideology, stems from untestable axioms/pretenses and proceeds from the general to the specific (which limits the accurate/logical scope of a method), is based on ""faith,"" and rejects valid criticism without inspection.<br /><br />The mantle of science is tarnished by misuse and misappropriation. The irony here is that the people who most abuse the authority of the scientific method do so by falsely claiming their ideology/knowledge/idea/philosophy to be drawn from science, or scientifically testable. People who see this fail to see the man behind the curtain and associate these instances with science, which only (and falsely) gives credibility to people who would discount the nature of science for ""alternative ways of knowing."" It's a vicious cycle. <br /><br />Science is not ""always right,"" or ""not always right."" The nature of the scientific method forbids ""right."" For communicating understandings to the common people (not pejorative), often times scientists over-simplify conclusions and their work to say, 'this IS the way it is, I KNOW so."" This is unfortunate, but people hate being excluded, and mistakenly assume they are being called stupid if they are told, ""I cannot explain it to you."" In a way, science does ask people to take things on faith, this is unfortunate, but not all people are demonstrably (as evidenced by the support for things like the Celestine Prophecy and the Secret) unable to think critically, analyze, and draw logically valid conclusions. <br /><br />Joke to finish: <br />What do you call ""Alternative Medicine,"" that works?<br />MEDICINE."

"event","So then... how is the weather where you are?
Actually, it's fine here. The wind was intense last night, and it made all sorts of fun noises. But that's not the point. This is:

I am, and have become, increasingly bad at keep in contact with people. I am busy, and at the same time, I'm not. Most times when I get a call from someone back home, or an e-mail, or a message of some sort, I'm otherwise occupied, and by the time I'm free from responsibility, the whole situation has kind of faded into obscurity.

So, if you're reading this, and chances are you aren't, I'm sorry. Wanna do something fun with me?

Hit me up for a game some time. 

And now,&nbsp; I'm off to a statistics lab final. Fun. Wish me luck!"

"event","9/10 students will agree, statistics are stupid.
Well, I made that up, but it's an interesting subject, boring class.
In the lab the other day, we were learning how to use a non-parametric test (Spearmans Rho). In stats, it is important to know when a test is applicable, when others are stronger, more accurate, or more predictive, and one of the questions was: ""What test should be followed by this step."" The answer was Spearmans Rho, but the diagnostic for figuring this out literally consisted of looking at the graph, ""eyeballing it,"" as my prof would say, and saying, ""I guess that doesn't look like a bivariate normal distribution.""

I guess? Isn't there some sort of test for a critical value? I don't know how to deal with this kind of vagueness in a math class...how can they grade a test when it all breaks down to someone's subjective impression of a graph?

Where will this end? ""I see four objects,"" ""that looks more like three.""
Hello, four and three are discrete integers.

MN, here I come."

Are there beginnings? Or, as Aristotle would argue, is all existence cyclical? In this case, it's a bit of both.

As much as I despise Aristotle, his work on infinite values and approximations were prescient. They would be seminal, but some idiot monk went nuts in the 1200's. Not all monks were idiots, of course, St. Augustine was on the level. You have to expect a level of ignorance, and in those days, a level of religiosity/superstition in even the most rational of men. We have it today, and it will only become more evident as time approaches infinity."

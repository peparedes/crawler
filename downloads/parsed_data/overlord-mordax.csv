"event","Some of you probably remember when <a href=""http://overlord-mordax.livejournal.com/265185.html"">I called someone out in the kin community a while ago and called them a faker.</a> While the person and I still have our differences, we have come to an understanding, and ceased hostilities. At her request, I am posting our reconciliation conversation here in the open, so that it may be as much a matter of public record as the initial feud. 


<lj-cut text=""The following has not been edited, except to remove the screennames of both parties."">

<strong>Her is now online</strong>
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> What?
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me: </span>What do you mean, what?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> You, you haven't changed at all.
I'm mostly pissed 'cause you slandered me. I never said I WAS kin. I am not kin.
You said that.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:&nbsp; </span>Did you expect me to have changed, honestly?
Alright, fine, but you were hanging out in the community, and making us all look bad by comparison.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> No I wasn't. YOU slandered me. You did. You picked me out and when you where having a bad day. How was I meant to respond? I was still going through an awakening and trying to learn. It was meant to be a learning place for me. When I realized I wasn't totally kin . I wanted to leave and was trying to.
I admit I made mistakes but what you did wasn't cool.
How would you like it if it was the other way around?
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> You're right. I acted with quite a lot of cruelty because you annoyed me. Honestly, I don't remember the details, but I would do it again if it happened again. Its my nature, and as both a batman fan and a kin you pissed me off.
And I would care. I've been slandered in public plenty of times. But I'm able to defend my beliefs, AND my self esteem doesn't rely on the approval of others.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> I'm NOT KIN!
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> No, I sadi I was pissed off AS a kin.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> You're alway pissed which is why I can't talk to you. You wont reason.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me: </span>Because other people don't differentiate. To the people outside, YOU are the face of kin.
People like you are a big reason people don't take us seriously.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Yup that's right it's my fault when it comes to you.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me: </span>I'm not sure what you mean by that sentence.
However, I think you mean that you think *I* am the one who has a poor public face.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Why do people have to be the same as you? I don't get that part.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Nobody has to be the same as me. You show your ignorance in believing I think that.
But what I demand from people as far as their abberant spiritual beliefs is that they be coherent, and that the person be able to defend them rationally.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her: </span>I do that but you tend to piss me off.
Which is why I can't talk to you.
I wanted to talk to you back then but you wouldn't with me.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> We're talking now. Obviously. And back then you put in a very poor showing as far as defending yourself.
So defend yourself now. Convince me. why should I believe you?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her: </span>'Cause I'm not fake. You can look me up on beenverfied.com. I've been spiritual/magical since in my teen years. I just don't know how to put things into words all the time. I like myself for who I am. I know what I believe in. I don't hurt anyone with it. It took me a long time to get where I am and I like myself for that.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Okay, firstly 'because I'm not fake' is an assertion, not evidence.
What is beenverified.com and why should I trust it?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> So you just don't think I'm a real person. Is that it?
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> No! That's absurd
I think you're a real person with poorly roleplayed and poorly written imaginary friends that you pretend are real.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> That's fine. I do not roleplay and nor do I have imagniary friends. If you think that then that is up to you.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> I find it amusing that you just throw back in my face whatever accusation I level at you.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Mmmm I have meet people from Metropolis and Gotham from my verse and so forth. I have also worked with friends online on eBay helping with spirits and so forth and have feedback for it. So yah.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Look, your medium-ship is irrelevant here. Let me ask you to do something for me
Please describe, in your own words, who you are, what your relationship with Gotham is, and what your relationship with the people thereof is.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> My name in Gotham Is Elisabeth. However, I mostly lived in Metropolis for most of the part. I was with Jonathan Crane and my adoptive father was Lex Luthor. I know and am friends with Alyce as well. I wasn't really pretty or anything like that just sort of there. I had more fun in high school then I did here as well.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> How is the you here related to the Elisabeth you? How do you believe you get back and forth? Describe the flow of information/energy.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Through portals and sometimes through sleep. Jonathan has the habit talking to me at night, which I really hate. Elisabeth and I are kind of the same but not. In Gotham and Metropolis I can be myself more . Here I am more limited. I work with computers and technology in Metropolis and sometimes Gotham. Sometimes I just talk to Jonathan and Lex. Again through portals and sometimes whenI feel Jonathan it's very warm but doesn't feel like a spirit though. Not the same type of energy.
I think I understood the first question.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Describe these portal to me. What are they? Do you physically leave this world, or is it mentally/spiritually?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> They physically leave. We've gotten into a pattern where Lex and Jonathan will sometimes live here with me.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me: </span>So, let me repeat what you just said.
You PHYSICALLY leave the world and enter gotham with your real body. And Lex and Jonathon PHYSICALLY come here and interact in this world with their real bodies? Is that correct?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Yes.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Okay. This is easy to prove then.
I will buy you a plane ticket, and you will come here, and prove this to me. I would absolutely LOVE to meet Lex. he is one of my heroes.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Sounds like fun.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> I am absolutey serious. If you can honestly physically travel to a version of Gotham city and bring people back, I will willing to worship you as a goddess.
However, I think you are not really able to do that./
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Not to that degree. No.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> But you just said that you could? What did I misunderstand?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> I can but never had them on a plane before.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Oh, that shouldn't be a problem, right? Just fly here by yourself, travel over from here and get them.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> We could always just go on my magic broom and fly. That be easier.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Okay, so you're trolling me. What was the point of this conversation?
I thought you wanted me to believe you are real?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Sarcasam ,
OK so you can't read sarcascam on line but that was too fun to miss.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Alight, fine. But what was the problem with what I suggested? Why can't you do that?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> I got confused by what you were saying ..... You know with the first question it threw me off.
It's like I can see them physically and they leave spiritually. I got confused by what you meant.
I'm being honest.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Okay, so they are not really physically here. You just see them as if they *were* here.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> yes, excatly.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Can other people see them?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Yea, my friend Jen can and my friend Missy can feel them and my friend Marie does too. She sees them as well.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Is there a way in which they can interact with people when they are here?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> I know Marie does. She can go back and forth , but I am not totally sure how. I've never asked. Jen does too, but more like through just walking and talking. She's married to one of the incarnations here. If that makes sense.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> I'm afriad that I've lost you a bit. Could you please clarify who Jen and Marie are?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> They are both from Gotham. Jen is Alyce. Marie is Janya. I have had spiritual friends who have been able to see them too. That one is Missy and a man name Jacob I knew a while ago could see them too.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Oh, okay. That is not what I meant. Let me clarify.
Can anyone you know who is originally from this world see or interact with people from Gotham when the people from gotham are here?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Do you mean if they are from Gotham or Metropolis? Or just anyone?
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> I mean anyone not from this world that you bring here. I am using 'gotham' to mean anywhere in the DC universe.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> If they are spiritually opened yes. My parents really are not into this sort of stuff and uh I do not hang out with a lot of people to ask . LOL however, my friend Deb who is a tarot reader has seen them too.
I'm still trying to understand what you are saying too. LOL.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me</span>: Its okay. I know we do not communicate well, so I am trying to be as clear as possible.
Let me ask; so, when Crane comes here, you are usually the only one who can see or here him?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Yes, unless I am at like a metaphysical shop or something like that and others sometimes will see them. If there like intuned.
And sorry for the barriar. I have a very low reading level. So it's hard for me to communicate at times.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> So would I be correct in saying that he travels here as a 'spirit' and not as a physical being?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> I am not totally sure in a weird way. See now they feel different to me then say like fairies, or ghost and etc. But could it just be 'cause of different energy frenquency?
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Yes, that makes sense to me.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her: </span>'Cause sometimes they are very solid to me and other times there not. I guess it depends on how much energy they have been around.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> When you used to update your Livejournal, sometimes there were entries signed by Crane. How were those typed?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Owie that was so confusing. It was by automatic writing. I hate automatic writing it makes me feel week but it's the best way for him to write.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> So basically Crane told you what to write, and you typed it?
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> I tried to the best I could, yes. However, with my medical problems here ... mmm let me see if I can explain. My brain is not totally caught up to my physical age. I often act like between 15-20. So when I type for him it drives him nuts any ways 'cause it doesn't get translated well.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Alright. That makes sense. In that case, I to Crane for attacking him based on the quality of your typing.
***I apologize to Crane for
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> It's ok . If you understood my medical background it would make so much more sense. And thank you.
Trust me when we first started talking . Jonathan and I fought a lot 'cause I didn't understand him half the time.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> I understand now. The way you communicate with Crane is different to the way I communicate with my bonds from other worlds.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Aaahhh ok. (:
Do you want me to accpet you as a contact on my list?
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> I usually don't use this email any more, but you can if you want.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> OK I will unblock you on the other one though.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> I appreciate that. Please let Crane know that I am sorry for the misunderstanding.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Honestly that would be good 'cause he hates LJ now.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> If you would like, I can post this conversation between us on my livejournal, so people will know we have come to an understanding.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> That be SO great. I would so apricate that .
Thank you so much for letting this conversation happen and
I am sorry for what I have said in the past too.
I really am I just get so over emotional about stuff at times.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> I am sorry that I attacked you publicly instead of taking the time to ask you about it in private.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her: </span>Apology accpected . Thank you for taking the time to talk . I am so glade we did this. 'Cause we would have so much fun together, which is also partly why I was so hurt. Does that make sense?
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Yes, that does make sense. If you come back to LJ at all, I would put you back on my friendslist.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her:</span> Thanks. Maybe I will try in the future, I would have to talk to Jonathan about it.
It's honestly more him then me.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> Alright. Well, I have to take care of some things around the house. But I will post this conversation to LJ, and I think we will talk in the future.
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Her: </span>That sounds great. I will talk to you again soon. Have a good evening.
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Me:</span> You too."

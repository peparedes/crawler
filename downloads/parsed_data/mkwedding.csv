"event","Haven't posted here in ages. Well, what's the point when the wedding is over, eh? Ah, i can post how i thought at this time of the year, i'd be a lot thinner, richer, and we'd be renewing our vows at a beatiful, relaxing place somewhere, enjoying what would be something JUSt for US.
And, i can post that yes. But what would be the point? I'm just as broke, a little bit fatter, ten million times more stressed out, and only finally getting used to living with someone and all the pet peeves, compromises, and wearyness that comes along with that!

Well, we also had all these big plans for an anniversary get-away, as well...but now it's just going to be a quiet trip to Santa Rosa CA. It's mainly to visit Uncle Wilson, Kevin's uncle who took us to Greece. It should be relaxing, though, once we get passed the drive. And we have been meaning to visit him.
I want to cry with the idea of happiness that goes along with not having to go to work though. Too paid it's not paid days off.
Anyway, Who knows. Maybe i'll be able to make a commerative post on that fateful date.
I am actually sort of shocked that one year came about so quickly. It's actually only 10 months we've lived together."

"event","Well, here's a start. It's raw, and not linked to the wedding webpage itself yet, but here's a HUGE long loading page of all our scanned photos from the wedding.. But seriously...a lot of them are fuzzy, most don't make sense as to WHY you would TAKE such a photo, and all i have to say is you get what you pay for, if you're going for the cheapo photographer guy *lol*
ah well, live and learn, and ruin your wedding in many different ways.
BUT despite the fact that some things still depress me about how they didn't turn out, we wasted money, and everything went wrong, i just have the comfort of knowing, it's the curse of my family, and that there will always be many things worse that will happen to us *lol*
Well, anyway, there are a couple nice photos. Of course, some that i like the best, are fuzzy due to his lack of skill at taking a photo, BUT oh well, i think you get the idea of a lot of them *l*
okay, here's the link...they load pretty fast for having so many : )

anyway, still don't have any wedding photos to my name! we've been SO busy still unpacking, and moving, and working WORK WORK WORK to pay off all this CRAP *l* that i haven't gotten to order any photos yet! i REALLY need todo that though...maybe tomorrow, i sort of get a day off kind of....then i ican post some photos online. there are some cute ones, i better get on the ball!!"

"event","so! hectic crazy stress! soooo much school work to get done, along with many little wedding details, but they're all organized and i feel good about it all. things are so far going really smoothly, and my mom started fitting me for my dress....it's actually almost done!i have to say, i started getting really excited finally, once i got to see how HOT i'm going to look in my dress! i've lost like an inch of the ol' fat all over, and i stopped losing weight, but i pretty much think  i still am, i'm just gaining muscle now. that's good too! toning : )
though now i have fat looking legs! i look good in my bathing suite, but now my legs look fat! Blah.
still have a bit of a chin though *glares at it* but i guess some things just think they're here to stay.
it's hard to tell if i reached my goal size, becuase in some clothes, i AM a 16! in some others, i'm really not *lol* but, it still feels great, because i was basically like that with a size 20/22 for a while there!

only bad note, is my ring has been being butchered by the jeweler...they broke my stone. nice huh?
so i need to deal with that.
more details on that later, but i'm tired now.
and still generally happy that things will turn out well, and be really beautiful! spent all day today (well it's 3am, so yesterday) giving my mom a perm *lol* she wanted one, and then kept putting it off, and i told her she'd better do it today when i could pencil her in on time, or i wouldn't be able to do it later! turnd out really nice for my first perm-giving, i must say! she'll look great too, becuase her hair is really long. i just love long curly hair. (it was really really long! we actually had to trim it a bit)
anyway, getting to the nitty gritty now...nail-fixins, hair touch-ups, gonna wax my legs in the next couple days...come on girls, say it with me now *OUCH* indeed!
i don't wanna be trying to shave in whatever weird set up they'll have on the cruise ship though, so i think it's worth it!
maybe *l*

ack, it's late. and i'm so busy i need my rest! so, sorry for no updates! prolly won't be another one for a while : )"

"event","Now, after all that fussing at my mom about not wanting a huge wedding, with a bunch of strangers there....i find myself with the smallest wedding ever! there will be like, 13 people there, couting me and kevin, the photographer and his wife, and the county clerk lady, and a possible someone there to videotape it for us *l*
Kevin was pretty sad that his uncle said he couldn't make it, but the uncle did make time for the wedding...just for when it was planned for november! i guess in may he's like, going to europe or something, so he can't be there.
(might have already said this? i don't know, i don't post enough to remember what i've already said : )
I'm sad that my friends in california can't make it. I mean, i know it's REALLY far away, and it is in the middle of the week, but i want to just convince them that it's okay if i buy them a bus ticket and they can come stay in my parents' spare bedroom *l*
but, if you can't make it you can't make it i guess!

on a happier note, yay losing weight! I might actually make my weight deadline after all! i definatly would if i'd remember to work out EVERy day, not just randomly when i remember...but i've had so much horrible evil school to deal with, that i can't seem to find time to do anything else! anyway, 20 more pounds to go!

Ordered kevin's ring the other day, and it arrived today!  He settled (finally, he was so much more picky about this than ME for once!!) on a Tungsten, polished plain band. It's like a mirror, it's really nice looking. I engraved the inside, and there ya have it!
Also, my ring is getting tweaked. again, here i dont' remember what i've said about it, but we weren't actually happy with how it turned out. lots of issues, but we found a jewler who could fix it up for us, and when it's done in perhaps two weeks, i'll post a pic up and explain the differences. I'm excited to have it turn out!!!
Sometimes i wish i hadn't tried to be so picky, and cheap, and guilted that he was spending money on me...i should have just let him pick something random out, from him, he picked, even if it was going to be expensive. BUT i think this will fix it, and then i can be happy with the ring.  So i'm excited about that!
Bah, picky picky! tired of being so piiiicky!"

"event","Let's see, tomorrow i need to call the photographer guy (since some of the engagement photos had weird spots on them, and he had to order them again) call the place we're going to stay that first night after the wedding, and make a reservation.
ask kevin if we ever finalized the reservations in seattle, since i cant' remember....oh and if we decided to make reservations at the space needle for dinner....
oh yeah, and email kevin's cousin back! she got the invite to the wedding and wanted to chat it up and get to know me *l* she seems nice, i'm just a bit shocked because so far everyone in his family has been really....distant really, so i'm just...shocked! *l*

I picked out the candle holders...(long story) but basically we decided to go with lighting a candle during the ceremony. My mom made these beautiful candles (well, i haven't seen them yet, but i saw the designs, and i believe her when she says they're beautiful! i'll take a pic and post it later) and the holders are just silver, but it will be a subtle elegance with the candles i'm hoping!
Got kevin's, hid dad's, and my dad's tux's ordered & figured out, FINALLY! hopefully they'll be okay, oh well if they're not!!! *l*

I still need to send the majority of the invites out. I need those pictures you photographer you!!!

btw..... . .  i'm finally getting EXCITED about the wedding. I'm passed the point of stressing, i've just reached the conclusion that Sure it may not be what i had in mind to begin with, but really, what DID i have in mind anyway??? either way this is going to be a memory for us...i'm just couting on it being a more FUNNY memory, than sweet or perfect, or ruined or whatever. We're usually pretty good at turning just about anything into a joke, so i'm sure we can laugh about all this later! MUCH later, but still later *g*
I met with the County Clerk lady, who does weddings, and she was like OH yes i'll do yours (only 50 bucks, rather than 100 for the other guy) but she's like, OH i like to say random things during the ceremony, to uplift spirits! hope you don't mind.
and that's when i decided, SURE lady, do whatever your little heart desires, because you know what? If it's good, we'll quote it to each other later, and if its' ridiculous, we'll make fun of you and quote that to each other, for the rest of our lives *lol*

I think the parents have finally started to calm down too, so that's a big plus! getting most of the details hammered out helps *l*
I'm starting to feel pretty bad actually about not helping my mom out as much, with the yard and stuff. I just don't seem to have the TIME though. I really should make some time.
BLah!
okay, off to slave away at school *barff*"

My mom was thinking something like these:

And though i think those are neat, and interesting, i think they would be annoyingly long, and it' would hamper me.
so i kind of like these...maybe with pearls around the edges? what do you think?

"event","now that all that car stuff is getting taken care of, i can put all my stress back into the wedding *g*
i was thinking about how i should do my hair....
i would LOVE to get hair extentions, but kevin said he'd hate knowing i had fake hair mixed in with my own hair. i can't say i really like the idea of that either, but i want longer hair! you can do so much more with it.
my hair just hasn't grown fast enough : (
i thought about maybe getting one of those 'hair clips' that's just this big clip of hair that clips onto your hair, but i dunno.
i have a picture of the drawing of how i wanted my hair, but i keep seeing all these other interesting and pretty things to do.
i cant' decide if i want to have some hair be gathered at the bottom into a pony-tail, or if i want just ALL of it up in some way, and then just sort of ""up"" in a ""down"" way, at the base of my neck....kind of like this i mean:
http://www.ivorydragons.com/images/wedding/womensgdec0007.jpg
basically here's a big list of photos, and give me your opinions on them!
<b>So, here is what i thought i'd like my hair to look like:
http://www.ivorydragons.com/images/myhair.BMP</b>

here are some other styles i thought would be really interesting:
http://www.ivorydragons.com/images/wedding/bewitchingd.jpg (i just think this girl is so pretty, this is a pretty pic, and i want little dangly hairs down, like she has)

"event","I got the castle i ordered. I would take a picture and put it up, but i broke my digital camera : ( i have to send it back to the factory etc.
anyway, it looks really nice. it's mixed white and clear glass, with silver details, and blue wind-swept flags coming off the towers. I dont' know if it was worth the price, *lol* but it's still really nice, and custom made.
So yay cake topper!

I also got the pressed flowers i orderd in the mail, yesterday. 
I had gone down to a copy place and found out they wanted a bazillion dollars to copy a few words in color ink onto my invitations, and still a lot if i only even wanted black ink...which i don't...so i just bought a new printer cartridge, and we'll see if i can just print out a few that way. my printer isn't really bad, but we'll have to see.
also the place in town was like ""oh, print us a copy and we'll copy it and do something weird, and no you can't just bring in a disk and we print it out for you and bla blah."" so hopefully i can just print them out on my own, and then put the flowers on!
I also saw this ""silver stain"" at bi-mart for four bucks, so i picked that up, to try it out. it's supposed to make the paper look all wonderful, so i'll have to practice with that and see.
The problem is, i would be doing all this like, right now! or in the next week....but i need to know what time to actually HAVE the wedding! it was going to be at 5pm...right? well, i contacted the Wollowa lake lodge, to see if i could get reservations there for the 25th, and 26th, but they only got back to me once to say ""oh we're all sick, what do you want?"" and so i told them, and they were all ""oh well we don't open up for (whatever) season, until the 27th! so we'll have to get back to you to let you know if we can let you come stay in our empty room for the 25th and 26th"" and then they haven't gotten back to me.
oh, yeah so anyway what i was saying is that since they are like an hour-hour 1/2 away, it would be really late by the time we got there! so i thought if i moved the wedding to say, three or so, then we wouldn't get there as late.
So anyway...that's where i am!

Called and reserved my FREE beverage fountain *lol* since i won that 25 dollar certificate, and so i'll have a kick ass cool wedding drink fountain!
made an appointment to look over flowers for a bouquet-since i have that 25 dollar off gift certificate...and tried to get ahold of the mary kay lady, for my free consultation and 20 dollars in free junk stuff, but she's out of town.
now if only i could find a gift certificate for a cheap hairstylist! *l*

I'm actually debating if i should get my hair cut for the engagement pictures. not cut cut, but trimmed, as the ends are being a bit frizzy. the problem is, i don't know what cut to get since i want to keep the legnth. I like how my hair is now, but the problem is the ends! and they won't know what cut this is, becuase i've been cutting my hair for ages now, myself.
it's just, random layer cut *lol*
anyway, i'd show you a pic of what i was thinking of getting, but my camera broke =P

hmm anyway, i ususally cut kevin's hair too, but i'm thinking maybe he should get his done professionally too....i don't want to mess it up!"

"event","So, most of you have probably already read <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/jaleely/18091.html"">here</a> how i had gone to a bridal show, and won prizes! Cooking stuff, and a 'honeymoon' package, with a two night stay at the Wallowa Lake Lodge near my town. (www.wallowalake.com) 
So, i called and switched our horseback riding from over where we were going to go (two hours away from the lodge) and moved it to right next to the lodge, and it was a lot cheaper, so yay! (going here http://www.eaglecapwildernesspackstation.com/#horserides)
Which is really neat, since we had 4 mights before we left for the cruise, where we had nothing to do! that and we were so downtodden with how things had been going lately, we really really needed such a great thing to happen for our wedding.

anyway, kevin is definatly going to come for march now--the 22-26th, so we're going to go get some engagement photos taken on the 23rd. I talked to the photographer and we decided to go the park here in town, becuase i thought it would be cute to have a pic of us on the swingset together *g* cuz we're such big dorky kids at heart, and also there's a river and such with a lot of other nice places for pics.
i'm getting totally stoked! there's only like 20 days until we see each other again, and also there's only two more weeks of classes for me *l*
oh, and i guess i'm kinda looking forward to the bridal shower my mom is throwing, now. it's on the 19th. she hasn't been fussing at me for days now, and so it's a lot easier to appreciate it *l*
I have a feeling there isn't going to be many people there...which isn't a problem since they're all over 40...*l* i guess i dont' see this really as an issue, but you get a distinctly different party from people that age, than say people around my age? *l* yes.
anyway, i felt bad kevin wasn't really getting anything like that, so i went shopping for him today. he's going to read this so i won't say what i got, but let's just say i got him a little ""groom-shower"" gift. not too naughty, but i could always add things! mwuahaha!
now he's just going to have to wonder (probably worry *G*) what i got him!

anyway, i know i'm getting a couple things just 'for me' at the shower, but most of it i'm pretty sure will be just things for wedding. Which is great since i don't want to invite all these people to the wedding itself! *l*
i hope i haven't seemed selfish or, really picky....it's just the situation where i didn't care either way, and my mom is mostly throwing this party for herself.

anyway, for the past couple days the hardest thing i've had to deal with is convincing my grandma not to buy us a couch *lol* i really don't need more stuff to haul down to CA, but i KNOW i don't need to haul that down there!"

"event","i thought this was helpful, and counts as going here since i'm on a strict wedding diet! *hides the wrapper from the ice cream i just ate*
____________
Q: I work part-time and the rest of the time I'm home. As a result, I find it hard to stop snacking all day! What can I do to stop?

A: Well, you accomplished the first step: identifying that you have a snacking problem! Now here's what you can do about it: Set a schedule. Establish an eating schedule that includes three meals and two snacks (one midmorning and one in the afternoon) and eat only at those times.

Clear off the counters. Store food, especially snack foods, out of sight in the pantry or refrigerator. The mere sight of food can trigger some people to eat.

Eat at the table. Designate only one spot in the house for meals, such as at the kitchen table, to encourage mindful eating. This will also put a stop to ""eating amnesia,"" whereby you walk through the kitchen, grab a handful of cookies, and munch throughout the house, half unaware.


Quit multitasking. Reading, surfing the Web or watching TV while eating make it all too easy to snack nonstop without noticing.

Get to the root of the snacking. Try keeping a food journal: Jot down the time, hunger level, what and how much you ate. Then identify what you were thinking and feeling each time you snacked.

Once you identify the trigger, you can formulate a strategy. For instance, if boredom leads to munching, keep a handy to-do list of things that need to get done, such as balancing your checkbook. Or create a list of fun things you like to do but often lack time for, such as getting a manicure or doing a craft project.

On the other hand, if you snack as a procrastination technique, set a beeper for a designated amount of time (such as 30 minutes) and give yourself permission to do whatever you like during this period. (Doing absolutely nothing counts!) When the timer goes off, fun time is over. This method should make it easier to get into your next task and skip the snack in between."

"event","So, I finally found a site that has some pressed flowers on it that are the right color! (I mean I finally got the sample, so I could see if it's what I wanted)
<a href=""http://www.mygatsby.com/product.jsp?ProductID=396980"">here</a>
now I just need to order them...I keep putting it off though for some reason. Not sure why, but I decided to order them like two weeks ago, but still I hold off....
Oh well, anyway what other news?
I guess my mom's decided to throw the bridal shower on the 12th of march it looks like. Eh. Whatever *l*
she does fully understand that I didnt want to invite a bunch of strangers to the wedding, so I guess it's okay.
I can't think of many other thingies to talk about really. I knew it'd slow down after a while, but since I was so stressed out, I sort of took slow to a complete stop! 
I did order a glass castle as a cake topper though 
I liked <a href=""http://www.glasscaketops.com/castles/castle32.htm"">this one</a> but wound up going with <a href=""http://www.glasscaketops.com/castles/castle19.html"">this one</a> because it was bigger. I mean, you want to see it right?
It'll have blue flags, silver flagpoles, and silver drawbridge chains. So hopefully it will turn out nice...(esp since I'm paying all that for it!) I should actually email the guy to see if he could give me photos or something of it, before he finishes so I can tell him if there's a mistake...hmm I probably should at least ask, huh?

Btw thanks pygmywarrior *g* I found that site a while ago and really looked into it...and then realized I needed pressed dried, not just dried! It actually took me a lot of time to find even close to what I was looking for, but hey, the internet has everything eventually, right? *l* anyway I forgot to say thanks!

Oh yeah and kevin's coming in March now...the 22-26th. So that's happy! I guess we'll go for the engagement photos afterall, since the sitting is free, it's just the cost of whatever photos we buy, and we're not obligated to by any right now or ever...so might as well!
Anyway, I'm off for a nap right now *l*"

"event","so nevermind, i decided to keep the guestbook after all, since i didn't actually want a BOOK type thing for people to write in (since there's not going to be very many people there, and so it seemed silly to have like a 60+page book) and C, i had thought a while ago that i wanted a signable photo frame, but as the date got closer, i realized a lot of people i don't actually know and have never met seemed to be going *rolls eyes* and i didn't want their signitures on there *lol*
i just didn't want to look at it in a few years and see like, five recognizeable sigs, and then 20 others and be like, ""oh honey, remember John P foofinhagin?"" so bleh...
So i'm just going to do this - keep the Silly GB thing i have now, set out the cards in a cute basket or something, and have people write down advice, wedding wishes, or memories and have them put them in a little like, cute mailbox or something, and then after the wedding is over, i'll just keep them in the little keepsake GB thing.
Or i could set it out after all and just decorate it. either way, less hassle, because!!!!!! they charge you shipping to return the stupid thing, and you don't get reimbursed...so it's silly i might as well just keep it.

<center>___________</center>

So, Kevin and i will have been together for 4 years, 6 months, and 13 days on the day we get married.
It was supposed to be an even five years, if we'd still gotten married on Nov. 18th, but oh well. This was easier for work and all that extra stuff...and weather *l* it snows FEET and FEET here! *shudder* UGH i hate that much snow! i used to love snow, but now i only like it at about two inches deep...no more!!!! *l*

needless to say i had a lot of time on my hands at my parents house yesterday, so math was the object of my still-ness.

Still trying to find some nice dried flowers. I want them! *stomps around in circles*"

"event","so i decided to go ahead and send the guestbook back (sorry for the messed up link, but i don't want to fix it *g*)
both kevin and my mom were like, why did you pay that much for one anyway? and i don't know! so i wouldn't have to make it *lol* but oh well, i will anyway.
I don't think a guestbook is going ot be that much of a big deal anyway, since we're <I>supposed</I> to not have that many people anyway.

hmm yes, well anyway. So how many of you have ever been on a cruise? I'm getting excited to go on one. I just hope i lose all the weight i want to by then. i haven't really tried to actually DIET diet since i was sixteen...and i got to a size 16! which is actually pretty okay for my body type and height. I had a fat eaty-everything-in-sight-day today though. =P oh well!"

"event","So, i went ahead and ordered this really cute guest book! rather than having people just sign pages, it has little note cards and encourages the signers to put little happy memories of their own wedding, or advice, or such and such on it.
so you can see what it looks like < href=""http://www.bridalpeople.com/wedding-guestbooks/9393.asp""> Click</a>
So, i thought wow, how cute! it's all silver and nice, and interesting....and then i get it in the mail today. It's not at <i>all</i> what i expected. It's small and lame, and <b>plastic</b> and thing, and just tacky. *l*
 So, here are my options: i could send this back (within ten days it says) and get my money back for it, since it's not what i thought it was....and then i can make one on my own similar to this. BUT if i did make one myself, i wouldn't have a nice way to put the cards in. i could punch a hole and tie them with ribbons or something, but THIS book has little clear sleek covers that they fit nicely into. SO I *could* just keep this one, and decorate the front a bit so it actualy looks nicer than the lame thin plastic front that it has now. but then i've paid 20 bucks to halfway make my own book anyway!
BLeh. Any ideas?"

"event","So i've never been a big flower person, and really i dont' have a favorite flower....so i think i don't mind if the only flowers that *might* be there at the big to-do, are fake *l*

But, that reminds me. So i'm making my own invitations, and was going to go all out and hand make the paper, and put some dried flowers on there, with some vellum paper with the printed words on it etc. etc., but really, as many as i'd *like* to send out, that would have been the biggest hassle in the world! and considering how i thought it was going to be stress-free, that would have been fine, but now ...bleh!
so i went and got some store blank invites/announcments, and am just going to print them in blue, and then stick some blue dried flowers on Those!
Ahh but here's the catch! did you know blue dried (pressed) flowers are the hardest things ever to find, besides a glass castle that doesn't have gold all over it? *l* well they are! so there, now you know.

i found a few websites that sell pressed flowers, but when you look at them, the ""blue"" is actually purple.
that, and i ordered a few samples, and YUP purple! 
i mean they just dont' come in dark blue. Oh they have baby/sky blue, but anything after that is just purple, people!

well, i emailed around to a few sellers, to see if they could offer me something i want (i enticed them with saying how many i'd like *g*)
which, actually since each flower goes for about .18 cents to .29 cents a peice! that is quite a lot. I wanted to get about 350 or so to decorate the invites, and responce cards. i'd like to do matching thank you notes, but i really don't foresee too many of those anyway, and it's expensive! like 60-100 bucks just for pressed flowers!

But, <a href=""http://www.net1graphicsdesign.com/purple_garden.html"">THIS</a> is what i was origionally going for, and they were 7 bucks a peice, so it's still cheaper than ordering them here!
I mean, come on! anyone can make that, and make it better probably!"

"event","not much more to update right now. i'm taking a sress break *l* i mean seriously, i think i went through panic mode for a bit there. sure sure i didn't mention it earlier, but it was building!!!
my mom was detailing me to death, and then kevin's parents went haywire and now his mom decided she's mad she didn't get to pick out her 'mom' outfit, and now they dont' want to drive to oregon, they want us to have it in las vegas, cuz it's a shorter drive for them. but my parents dont' want to go there, and really my dad can't travel that far becuase of a back injury.
so that went on for a few days.
but now it's back at my parents house in oregon, *l* and everyone's just going to deal with it!! and LIKE IT!
blah.
so, taking a break, calming down. trusting that it will all turn out right. geez i mean i've got months here, i shouldn't be this stressed out already, right??? i mean, i thought this would be a stres free thing! it takes a LOT to stress me out! can i just say i was not expecting stress??? *l*

it's just i would have been totally fine, and fun, but i wasn't expecting the parent factor! Bleh!!!!"

"event","well, the wedding's coming to a point where most of the big details that can be done now, are, and most of the little details that can be done later, everyone's squabbling over *lol*
my mom keeps freaking out about the MOST tiny thing, and i have to keep reining her back in...and i feel horrible since i know she's just trying to help! but i think it's all under controll now.
i still need to pick out some shoes
and we still need to fix up the yard (agree on a way to block off the ugly stuff)
and now since i don't want to pay 65 dollars for the one glass castle i could find ANYWhere...(though it would have blue flags, with silver details) it's still a bit much....my mom and i decided to make a castle with frosting...or that candy marzipan stuff, you know? we saw this cake book that had this really big neat one on it. so, we'll see!
oh, and (i probably already mentioned this, but oh well! here it is again in detail!) since kevin and i are going on that alaskan cruse, on the 29th, that gives us a few days (from the 25th obviously!) so we decided to go horseback riding on the 27th! he's never been, and i LOVE IT, and we've been planning to go for ages. i called this guy in the next town over, and he's going to give us a good price. I haven't been riding in SO LONG, and i love love love it! then we're going to drive up to seattle, on the 28th, stay the night, and then up at 8am to board the 7 night cruise!
did you know they automatically charge you ten dollars a day, per person, for tips? you can't get out of it! so we pay an extra 140 dollars for TIPS!!! i know for a fact there might only be like, ONE person who deserves a tip. UGH i hate how society thinks people are SUPPOSED to tip! it's a T I P people, for when you have good/exceptional service!!! it's not like, we're obliged! ugh. and i've WORKED hard jobs like that, and yes i do think it's still silly to tip becuase you HAVE to!

I was going to make them, like, really make them! i mean make the paper by hand (i've done that before for other projects) but it just seemed like so much trouble since there are so many i wanted to send out... so i bought these sheets of cardstock with a pearlized border, and am going to print my own, and then place some blue dried flowers on them for decoration.
I also finally picked up my tiara! it's edged in pearls, and it's pretty simple, but ..pretty! I don't have a pic up yet though because i forgot it at my parent's house. oh well!
I also got some wax seals. i have so totally always wanted one, and so i'm going to seal the invitations with an old fashioned wax seal!
hmm i can't really remember what else we did.
just randomness probably.

blah..my mom and i are going to boise friday, and while we're there we're naturally, looking for MORE stuff!
I'll be searching for a good price on Kevin's Wedding band.
he wants a black titanium, 6 or 7mm wide ring, with two silver stripes around it. Interesting huh?
I'm also going to search like crazy for a Glass Castle wedding cake topper, since EVERY SINGLE ONE i find online has GOLD trim, and i hate gold!!! *FIT*
oh well.
I'm also picking up my tiara! woooo i'm a princess!
looking for dried flowers for the invitations we're making...
and hopefully going to try on a pair of shoes, to go with my dress. (if they're there! they had to order them)
Yes folks, they are...glass slippers! well, they're acrylic, but they're really pretty. If i can't get them at this place, i might just order them online somewhere, but they're expensive! BLAGH! like 40-50 dollars.

OOOH and i finally found the song! The song I'll walk down the isle to.
I'd been searching and searching...for like 4 years! I really wanted a Corr song, but all their instrumental music was fast paced, or just not right. Then, their 2004 release, has the PERFECT one! it's called 'minstrel boy'. it's short, and the first part the mom's can walk down, throwing flowers or something *l* and then the second half is just right for me : )

"event","Well, to get the ball even more rolling...i thought i'd just list for my benifit, all the things i've gotten, that i needed or wanted for the wedding. and oh yeah, the theme-neat huh? well i think so. also the colors are blue, silver, and white--same as this site! *g*
Let's see....
   *We picked, and booked, the photographer ($500 dollars -$400 of that goes towards our purchase of the photos)
   *We set a date for engagement photos, which of course kevin has to get a flight for, and come up to do them with me. ( a weekend in march)
   *I bought Toasting glasses 
   *matching cake servers
   * little castle placecard holders 
   *Personalized napkins!(i found this highly exciting!)
   *matching plume feather pen, for the guestbook (gb which hasn't arrived yet)
   *Fabric for my dress, and vale, and for the men's vests, and ties, and for the women's dresses, and patterns so my mom can make all that!

which at this point i should mention that i have no attendants for the wedding (groomsmen, bridesmaids) But, our parents are going to stand with us. My dad will walk me down the isle, and my mom is my Matron of honor, while kevin's dad is his best man, and his mom will stand with him also...I thought about having the ladies maybe be my duel flower girls too *lol*
we'll see what they think!

I was going to put pics of the stuff up, just cuz i think it's cool and exciting, but i think it will be easier to just i dunno, put i link up sometime to a page on my website with all that gumbo on it. 
Weeeee shall seeee!

Oh yeah, and we PURCHASED our Honeymoon CRUISE!!! Yes folks, it's a 7 night cruise from seattle, to alaska, and back!  we'll stop in canada, and go up to the glaciers, etc. I'm so excited! 
Kevin will drive up with his parents on the 22-stay the night in reno, then finish the drive and arrive on the 23rd. Then on the 24th the dad's and kevin are going on a fishing trip, while the moms and i go get manicures etc, and relax! then we have the rehearsal that night, then the next day the wedding! I think it will be at 5pm. Then dinner, then everyone leaves, and we hang out a bit, then i thought we'd go stay in a bed and breakfast, or hotel or something, and then we're going to be around to help return rentals, because the honeymoon cruise doesn't leave until the 29th i think. we'll drive up the 28th, stay the night in seattle, and off we go at 8am the next day!
Woooha!
So...much...planning!!! *barff*"

"event","Alright, i decided to go ahead and do SOMETHING useful with a stupid livejournal. 
I'm going to give every little detail about my upcoming wedding!
Yay. I think i'm the only one thrilled about this, but oh well *g*

Well, first off, let's start at the beginning.
Kevin and i met, about september 1999 on a website chat, Pages of Legends. It's a robert jordan (author) fansite. But, it's also a small community of (mostly) really sweet people.
He and i were introduced by my online best friend, Amanda! Well, we chatted every so often, but that was about it. He was busy with school, and i was busy just being online and goofing off.
Well, about a year later, after i started college at E.O.U. (eastern oregon university) He and i were talking, and I decided we should chat on the phone. The first time we talked it was for <b>8 hours</b>!!! And, two weeks later, we were inseperable. (That was November 18th, 2000) And, the next month- He flew up from Souther California, to meet me face to face for the first time.   A month after that, (right after valentines day) he gave me a promise ring.
And the rest is history!
Well, for the past two years i've been culminating all kinds of wedding stuff, only to throw that idea out, and start all over with a whole new idea.
We at first were going to have the wedding at the Delta King riverboat, in Sacramento california...well, before that it was a garden in australia, then the beach in Elk california, then Sacramento....Sac held for a while, and then we moved it to Hood River oregon...well, that area...really to Husum Washington, wich is across the river. We were going to have it in a big castle there! (beautiful place) but the guy smokes who owns it, and so that sort of turned us off. Also we decided to spend less on the wedding, and more on the honeymoon.
So then we decided to go to las vegas...maybe the Venitian, or Bellagio....but finally we settled on North Powder Oregon, at the house my parents just bought- in their front yard! (oh, and at every place we settled on at the time, i had picked out everything from the photographer, to the food, to the DJ and officiant--then did it all again! I must love wedding planning.)
So now here i am, finalizing all of this on--what else? The internet.
Also, i figured it would help me clear things up since this is IT people, For REAL and i needed to write it down somewhere *l* why not here?

SO May 25th, 2005 is the date of doom...ah i mean date of love!! We're really not THAT nervious........ . . .  most of the time!"

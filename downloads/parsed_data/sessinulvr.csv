"event","Dear Friends,

I hope that your summer has been a good one, as mine wasn't. I hope that your year goes great as mine is going to be hell on earth. I hope you guys enjoy every minute of rp, and chatting with friends, as I am going to wait and see weather or not I am going to see my mother again. 

To all of you guys, I wish you the best in everything, as I finish my senior year in college. *waves to all and fades*

P.S.

Rain drops and falls, but it never falls or drops in the same way."

"event","The time we have in this world is short. That what you have and hold it close to your heart and soul. Remember that everything is just just a arms length away. Don't back down from anything no matter what. Stay close to friends and love ones and don't take anythign for granted. Stay strong is what you believe in and hope to God or whoever you believe in to be the God of Gods. Be positive in everything and everything will come to you in the end.

Mircales happen everyday and the light around the rainbow shines on you sometimes, so be happy that you are live and ready to see the world.


Sincerely to all,
sessinulvr"

"event","The days and mouths unhold as we move on with our lives. We try to make it clear that we live in a world of peace and safety. We try to live in what we imagine the world to be, as other people move around you like chess pieces moving across the board. The world is never what you think, as I think that even the nicest people do things that you never would ever find. But spring break is a nice little week that we can relax and just say forget the world and just live it out. I say to just relax and let life flow to whatever.

Life is life, peace is peace.

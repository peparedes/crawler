"event","So last week Jeff came over and stayed the night with me. I talked to him for hours and I've done a lot of thinking since then. I've come to the conclusion that even though I care about him, I'm not going to go back out with him. He's a great guy and he'll always be a close friend of mine, but I really want to give my new guy friend a chance. I'm young....I have years to date and meet the guy of dreams right? Now I have to figure out how I'm going to tell Jeff...I feel so bad...(He's so sweet..I wish you girls could have known him better.) The best way is to be honest and just tell him the truth...As hard as it will be that's what I have to do....I hope he'll understand. I'm going to go take a shower so I'll talk to you girls later. bye."

"event","Hey girls! I haven't updated recently, but I'll try to keep up with doing that. A little over a week ago I met a sweet guy named Eric. I have hung out with him a few time since then, and I'm really looking forward to getting to know him better. Last Sunday, he took me to Sioux Falls and we ate at the Olive Garden. It was perfect the food was amazing and I had a great time talking and hanging out with him. I hung out with him a couple times later that week and this weekend. I like him a lot so I hope things work out for the best with him. I would like to be his girl friend, but it's too soon to think about that. I'm not sure what is going to happen, but I do know that I'm happy and it's nice to have a guy that lives in Brookings.....There are other things I need to talk about, but I don't want to ruin this journal so I'll end it with happy thoughts. I love you! (Especially you Tiffany, because I know you always read our silly journals!)"

"event","Hey everyone! I can't believe I haven't updated my journal since Thanksgiving. It's amazing how fast time goes by sometimes. A lot has happened to me lately, but I don't feel like typing so I'm going to summarize as much as I can. Jeff and I broke up exactly a month ago on December 11th. It was both of our decision and I honestly know that it worked out for the best. Jeff is a great guy and he's fun to be around, but we are simply not meant to be a couple. At least not right now, maybe in the future. I don't know. I like having him as a friend though. I don't regret going out with him, because even though we only dated for a couple of months I learned a lot from him that will help me with relationships I have in the future. I'm definitely learning from my mistakes and more about myself. I need to work on being less selfish and more understanding. I don't blame myself or Jeff for our relationship not working out, because no one is to blame. I'm actually a lot happier being his friend and hanging out with him when I was his girlfriend. Before I date another guy I'm definitely going to be friends with him first. =) Okay, I don't feel like talking about this anymore so I'll change topics.

This journal is going to be really random so I hope you guys enjoy reading it! My family and I moved into our new house in White about a month and a half ago. It's nice and I love having my own house, but I hate being away from my friends. That's probably why I've spent most of the past month and half living with Tracie and Janna. My life has been going pretty well, lately. Bowling is okay. I'm not bowling as well as I would like to, but it's still fun. School sucks as usual, but the year is half way over and soon we will be finished.=) This week is semester testing so I have a lot of studying to do! I'm looking forward to this weekend. I want semester tests to be over and I'm excited for the bowling tournament in Sioux Falls. Friday is also pay day, which means I get money so that makes me happy. =) Well, I don't know what else to talk about so I'm going to continue researching about the pros and cons of animal testing for medical research so I'll talk to you guys later! Take care. I love you! Byebye!"

"event","Last Friday I went to my grandparent's house with my family and Jeff. I had a lot of fun. My cousin Kelsey and her family were also there. They are from Ceder Rapids Iowa, which is about 7 and a half hours away so I only get to see them during holidays or the summer. We all had a lot of fun. We played a lot of board and card games. We listened to my dad and my uncle play music, and we ate a lot of food. Everything was delicious especially the lefsa and mashed potatoes. Overall my weekend was great. It was really nice to see all of my family and be able to spend time with them. I'm a little sad that I didn't get to spend time with my mother's parents, because they cooked a big meal for us and even bought me a cake for my birthday. We would have gone over there, but Jeff had to be back in Canton by 3:00 for a Thanksgiving meal with his family. That's okay though because it was really important for him to spend time with his own family, since he spent the whole weekend with mine. I'm really happy that he came with me, because I had a good time.

Can you guys believe we actually had a snow day today? I woke up and I was amazed. I was so happy and I slept in until noon. Today, was okay except for the part when Kevy beat the shit out of Dani and me. He gave me a black eye and I have a bruise on the left side of face on my jawbone. It really hurts! He also threw a pop bottle towards me, but it missed and hit Dani in the ear. It sliced her ear open and there was blood gushing everywhere. It was really disgusting, but I felt so bad for her. She should have gone to the emergency to get stitches, but she wouldn't go to the hospital so now she's suffering. The reason Kevy decided to hurt us was because we wouldn't let him play his video games, because we were watching a movie. He played his video games all morning for hours so I figured it was okay that we watched a movie. So yeah, now he's grounded from playing all video games, and he doesn't get any money. It still doesn't make it fair that I have a black eye and Dani has a crippled ear so I'm going to get revenge on him. Maybe I'll shave off one of his eye brows or pour honey in his hair when he's sleeping. haha! I'll figure out a great way to get that little fucker back! Talk to you guys later! I love you. Bye!"

"event","Hey guys! I miss you so much. I'm really mad that I missed my bowling competition today! Oh well, hopefully I'll be able to go to practice tomorrow. Thank god this is only a three day school week. I've been so sick for the past week it's crazy. I seriously feel like I'm dying. I went to the doctor on Monday, I was tested for mono., strep throat, and tonsilitis but I don't have any of them. I have some type of virus throat infection and an ear infection in my left hear. It really sucks because I can't sleep because I can't breathe through my nose so I try to breathe through my mouth then I start snoring, coughing, and choking. So yeah I've got a couple hours of sleep every night since Saturday. I have to force myself to drink liquids and I haven't been eating very much so that sucks too. Grr I'm so annoyed and frustrated. I just want to feel better. No matter what I do I still feel like crap. Maybe I should go back to the doctor. I don't know, but I do know that I don't want to miss anymore school. I hate missing school. At least everyone has been really nice to me for the past week. I ask them to get things for me and they actually do it so that makes me feel little better. I'm really looking forward to this weekend, because I get to hang out with a bunch of my family and Jeff. Jeff is coming to Brookings on Thursday and coming to Minnesota for Thanksgiving with my family, Bill, and I so that should be fun. Oh yeah! I still need to finish my journal about my 18th Birthday. I don't feel well, right now so I'm going to go, but I do it later. I love you guys! I miss you. Love Always, Karin.

P.S. You guys can call me if you want to talk for a little bit. The hotel number is 692-3111 and my room number is 128!"

I can legally rent porn by myself! Just kidding. I'm more excited to be an adult, even though I really don't feel older! I'm going to go look at pictures with Janna on Katie's website so I'll finish updating all of this later. I love you guys! Hello! I'm finally finishing this journal two weeks later. On my birthday I went shopping with my mom, Danielle, Janna, and Bill. I got some new clothes and a new coat. I also went to the Pizza Ranch with them for dinner. It was really yummy! That night Janna, Dani, Bill, and I also got our left ears pierced on the upper part of our cartilage. It hurt a little bit, but it was completely worth it. I think I might get my right ear pierced in a few weeks, but I don't know. So anyways, I also went to the midnight showing of Harry Potter with all of them and my mom and Kevy too! It was a great movie and I highly suggest for all of you that haven't seen it yet to go check it out. So overall my 18th birthday was a lot of fun. I still have to make birthday party plans so if any of you guys have any ideas tell me! I love you guys! bye!"

My mom and I are driving to Canton tomorrow after school so we both get to meet Jeff's mom. I'm really excited about all of this, especially because I get to keep him all weekend. (I know that sounds silly, but I'm so happy!) Jeff is so sweet. I think I talk about him too much sometimes, and I do annoy myself because I repeat myself when I talk about him, but I just can't help it. God I'm so stupid!

"event","Hey guys! I haven't updated for a few weeks so I have a lot to talk about. The trouble is I don't remember everything so I'll try to talk about the main things. Jeff and I started dating on the 9th of October. I've met his friends Randy and Dave. I like both of them they're nice. I really can't remember anything that's been going on in the past few weeks. Hmm.....I've been spending a lot of my time sleeping, doing homework, and hanging out with Jeff.I've hung out with friends too, but not as much as I would like to. I spend a lot of time at the hotel watching my brothers....That really sucks, but oh well...bowling season starts on Friday! So that will give me some time away from my evil siblings. I miss Jeff....I just saw him this morning lol! It's amazing how quickly I miss him....Hmmm I think I'm pathetic....at least I'm happy right? I really don't feel like typing so I'm not going to bother with grammar right now. I'm hungry ice cream cake sounds so good right now. Yum! So yeah getting back to Jeff there are a few things I don't like about him...but he's still amazing and the good things definitely over weigh the bad things...(The main thing that bothers me is that he smokes...I'm also bothered about the whole jealousy thing, but he'll probably get over it.)I was just thinking that I've been getting annoyed really easily...I just want to hit the guy sitting next to me...I don't know who it is, but he's making stupid little noises that makes me want to smash his face in! lol. Wow... I've been really bitchy the past three weeks and I've been sick on and off for the past three weeks too! I have a doctor's appointment on Thursday so that makes me happy. I got to meet my cousin Hanne on Friday and I hung out with her Friday night and Saturday. She's so pretty, sweet, and funny. I was worried that I wasn't going to get along with her, but she's a lot of fun. She's the type of person I would be best friends with. Friday night Hanne, Danielle, and I went to the movie the fog. It wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be, but it was still freaky.  On Saturday I had to take the ACT so I didn't get to hang out with her until after noon. The ACT sucked it was hard and I know I'm going to retake it, unless I magically do well...So yeah Saturday was Tracie's 18th birthday and her party...It was nice to hang out with everyone at Tracie's apartment. Hanne said she had a lot of fun too, because it was like being at home with her friends....I guess she's really home sick, but I don't blame her I can't imagine how difficult it would be to live in a different country and not know anyone. Poor girl. Anyways...During Christmas Vacation I'm going to hang out with her again and we are going to go to the Mall Of America. We were talking and she told me that when my family and I come to Norway in a few years she's going to take my sister and I to a bunch of crazy parties! I'm excited.. =)I'm in a really random mood right now.... I was so happy last night, because not only did I get to keep Jeff over night...I got to talk to Rey on the phone! I've missed him so much lately. I really hope I get to talk to him sometime soon. He's so sweet and cute....There's nothing wrong with talking about other guys as long as I don't do anything with other guys right? Yep! I'm right lol. Oh my god....I'm so tired....I'm sick of school...I wish it was summer time and I was already graduated....I don't want to go to college, but I really don't want to be here right now or any day. I should really work on my stupid english paper...I love you guys! Take care. Karin.

P.S. I'm sorry if this journal doesn't make sense...I'm really sleepy and lazy right now!"

"event","Hey guys! It seems like I haven't talked to most of you forever! I was really busy last weekend, but I had a lot of fun. On Friday, I went to Sioux Falls with Janna and her mom. We went shopping at the Empire Mall and Gordmans. Janna bought a lot of new clothes for senior pictures at DEBS, and I bought a really cute pair of blue jeans at Gordmans. The trip to Sioux Falls went well, except for Janna and her mom fighting. (Oh well, hopefully they'll figure out their differences, but Janna's mom is seriously mean to her!)

On Saturday I had my first date with Jeff and it couldn't have gone better. I had a lot of fun and I really enjoy hanging out with him. He got to Brookings around 7:00 so we decided to go to a movie. On the way to the movie theater his muffler fell off! I felt so bad...but it was kind of funny..he just left it there so we wouldn't be late for the movie. We went to the movie Flightplan I liked the movie because it wasn't predictable, but it was a little long. Afterwards we ate dinner at Perkins. (Thank God I forgot that Eric was a cook there and I was able to enjoy my delicious chicken sandwich.) My mom wanted to meet Jeff so we went to the hotel for a little bit to visit with my family, then we went over to Tracie's house to watch Guess Who with her and Paul. (I love Bernie Mac he's so funny!) Anyways, after the movie Jeff and I went back to Brookings and hung out in his car for a few hours. lol.

"event","I'm at the library with my mom, then we are going to go eat somewhere for supper. I've been researching to find an interesting disease to do my project on for health occupations. After reading about different disease for about an hour I've decided that I'm going to do my 1000 word report on Angelman Syndrome. Angelman syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by severe congenital mental retardation, unusual facial appearance, and muscular abnormalities. Symptoms include unstable jerky gait, hand flapping, unusually happy demeanor, developmental delay, lack of or diminished speech, and microcephaly (small head). Epilepsy may develop in the early years of life, however it may decrease with age. Patients may also have balance problems. I don't know the details about the project, but I decided to start researching early so I can get it done as soon as possible. 

Yesterday, I hung out with Shelly for the first time in weeks. She called me and asked if I wanted to hang out with her so we went swimming and took pictures with her camera phone. It was a lot of fun to see her again, and I really hope that she comes back to Brookings for school. I woke up at 7:35 this morning so I was almost late for school, but I made it a few minutes before the bell rang. Overall today was pretty good, unfortunately I have a huge 350 word vocab. test in Health Occ. tomorrow morning. I'm really not looking forward to taking that test, but I guess I'll be happy to have it done with. My stomach is making noises...I'm so hungry...I wonder when my mom is going to be ready to leave...I want to go eat! lol. I'm in a complaining mood right now...

I feel really random right now I'm not sure if my journal makes a lot of sense, but that's okay. I miss Jeff I hope he calls me tonight...I would call him, but I don't want to bother him. Only three more days and I get to hang out with him! He better send me a picture of himself to show all of you before he comes here or I'll be mad! (Jk! I will be disappointed though.) I really miss Rey too! I haven't talked to him forever.... Oh well, I'm sure I'll talk to him sometime soon he's probably busy with school and work. I don't have anything else to talk about so I'm going to go. Bye Bye. Love Karin."

I have a date with Jeff on Thursday we aren't sure what we are doing, but I know we are going to eat somewhere nice. (If you guys have any ideas share them with me!) I'll tell you guys all about it on Friday. Earlier this week I went over to Darcy's house with Janna. Darcy and her room mate Jen are so pretty and really funny.

Saturday was really really busy and a lot happened, but I'm really tired so I'm going to make this journal as short as possible.  I had bowling league with Tiffany and Janna at 10:30 a.m. I'm ecstatic that I went because I got a new high score of 202. I can't believe I had six strikes in a row! lol. After bowling Tiffany and I ate at Taco Johns, then we met Tracie, Paul, and Janna at the movie theater. The Exorcism Of Emily Rose was a great movie, but it scared me a lot. (It's unbelievable that it was based on a true story, but I guess I believe it.) I've always believed in that sort of thing. I also believe in spirits and I think I believe that there might be other planets like Earth somewhere in the universe. =) Before you all think I'm crazy I'm going to talk about something else. We went to Goodwill after the movie and bought clothes for our homecoming spirit days. For inner city youth day I got this really long, yellow jersey, and I found a black bandanna and some *bling bling*. I'm really excited about this week especially for Wednesday and Friday. Around 5:00 Tiffany and I showed up at Erika's birthday party. Erika's party was a little boring, but I stil had fun. (It was cool to meet her sister, the food was great, and her niece was a great little entertainer lol.) Babies are so cute! On Sunday I went to church with Tiffany, I took a nap, and I hung out with Shelly. Shelly and I went to Dairy Queen and we went to Wal-Mart. For the rest of the day I did my homework, watched movies, and played with my kittens. I don't feel like typing anymore so I'm going to go. Take care. Karin."

"event","Hey guys! I'm so tired. I didn't get any sleep last night so I'm a little cranky today. That stupid storm woke me up at least four times, and my kitten Bailey wouldn't leave me alone. He kept on trying to lay in my hair and on my pillow. I don't know maybe the poor thing was  afraid of the storm. (The thunder was really loud.) This morning I went outside to see most of my yard covered in water, and on the way to school most of the roads were flooded too. I usually love storms and I enjoy watching them, but I like to sleep too! Today, has been going by really slow, and I have a lot of homework to do tonight so I won't be doing anything fun. Oh well, at least I have this weekend to look forward to. During english class today Mr. Ganci's students got to run down the hall and into his class room. It was for video tech and I'm guessing it's going to be on the homecoming video or something, but I'm not sure. I guess we'll see next week...Wow! Next week is already homecoming? I can't believe it! lol. Yep. Next week is going to be really great. I love you guys. Take care. Karin.

P.S. Tiffany I'm probably going to call you but if I forget please call me! I would like to know if we are going to bowl Saturday mornings for league?"

Last night I wrote Justin a letter and I talked to him so I guess we are on good terms. I don't hate Justin I just dislike some of the things he does...and the way he has treated my sister in the past. Honestly I can't see their relationship working out long term, but I could be wrong. (I've been right about all of the other guys she has dated, but then again they were all fucking retards.) (I still think Brad is better looking than Justin though, lol!) I talked to Rey last night and I had him leave a message on my journal. (I hope he got a lot of studying done last night...I kind of feel bad for bothering him.) Grrr...my stomach keeps on making noises, and I'm so hungry! Right now, I think Pizza Ranch sounds really really good. I'm going to go to Pizza Ranch for supper on Friday so if anyone wants to come with me give me a call. I don't have anything to talk about so I'm going to check my e-mail. Take care everyone!

P.S. I'll update my journal later and tell you guys about Tracie's pictures, even though all of you will probably see them tomorrow. =)"

I always feel so safe and happy here, but I'd be happier if my cousin Kelsey was here. She had to stay home because she had a lot of homework. Oh well, I'll be home tomorrow night so I guess I might live. lol. So yeah, last night I went to the football game with Janna. It was a little boring at first, but it was so fucking funny when Travis smashed a guy from the other team into the ground. It was so cool! I love when stuff like that happens. (As long as it happens to people on the other team that is.) Katie also did a great job with her flag! After the game I went to Tiffany's house and hung out with her for a couple hours. I played with Hershey for a little bit, and we watched Elimadate and a little of Ripley's Believe It Or Not. (Janna came over for a little bit too.) I was going to stay the night with Janna but both of us were too tired so we just slept at our own places. I woke up around 12:30 today, and I was in Minnesota around 5:00. My mom and I went to her parent's house first for about 40 minutes, then we came over here. Tomorrow afternoon I have a family reunion in Oliva, Minnesota. (My dad's father side of the family) I'm really looking forward to that...it's going to be so boring! Oh well, I'm going to go because I don't have anything else to talk about.

I really hope Christina and Austin are the homecoming queen and king. I'll be disappointed if some stupid little prep bitch that I hate gets it. lol. Wow! I'm really not in a bad mood it would just piss me off if Nicole gets homecoming queen. She's so fake! Kind of like how I got really pissed when Nicole won most inspirational for bowling! Ahh...that still upsets me. Anyway, I signed up for a senior shirt and I'm going to pay for it tomorrow. I really hope that the shirt is not retarded and if it ends up being that dumb O.A.R. quote I'm going to freak! So yeah, last night I talked to Rey for awhile. Talking to him always makes me feel better even when I'm having a really shitty day. I wish he lived a lot closer to Brookings. Even 3 or 4 hours away wouldn't be so bad, but 10 hours is crazy! I don't know...maybe he'll move closer or I'll move closer to him someday. I love talking to him because I can just be myself and not have to worry about him thinking I'm retarded, and even if he is thinking that I'm probably thinking the same thing about him! lol. =) I love friends they are so great!

"event","Hey everyone! It's 7th period and I'm in the library because it's my free hour. I can't believe that my summer is gone and school is already here. The first day of school was great considering it only lasted one hour. lol. After school I went out to lunch with Tracie, Tiffany, Erika, and Janna we ate at Z'akota. Tracie and I went over to Tiffany's house afterward to see her senior picture clothes. Tiffany left Tracie and I alone to babysit Hershey when she went to go pick up Jake. I don't think Tracie and I were very good babysitters though. lol. Even though Hershey is fixed Tracie thought it would be funny to see if she would hump her. So Tracie was sitting on a chair with her leg out in front of Hershey to hump her. I couldn't stop laughing when Hershey actually started to hump Tracie's leg. It was really gross, but at the same time it was so funny. When Tiffany got back Tracie showed her the wonderful thing Hershey could do. I don't think Tiffany liked what Hershey was doing but I'm sure she still thought it was funny. Hi Tiffany! ((I'm sure you'll read my journal))

Tracie and I stayed at Tiffany's house until around 4:30, then she brought me home, and she went to work. After work Tracie picked me up, we got something to eat, and went back to her apartment. We were supposed to hang out with my friend Mike but he ended up being an ass so we hung out with her friend Derrek. (He's twenty-five, he works with her at McDonalds, and goes to SDSU.) Derrek was a lot of fun to hang out with and he is so funny. We watched movies, listened to music, and just hung out. I thought we would probably stay there for a few hours, but we didn't get home until around eight a.m. We only slept for a few hours so I was a little cranky yesterday. 

Yesterday, I went to Back To School with Tracie and she went with me so that was fun. After her session Tracie, Paul, and I went to McDonalds for lunch, then we went to my session. When I got home from Back To School I took a shower and called my friend Mike. We talked for a couple of hours and I'm not upset with him anymore. (He's such a sweety) I misunderstood him when we were talking on the computer, and I guess he wasn't being an ass to me. So I'm going to hopefully hang out with him sometime soon. 

Today, was the first full day of school, and I already have home work! =( Oh well, I really enjoy all of my classes and I like my teachers so I think this year is going to be a lot of fun. I'm not sure what I'm going to do tonight, but I'm going to call Rey and Shelly. I haven't talked to either of them for about a week. I miss Rey. lol. (He's so cute) Well, I don't know what else to talk about so I'm going to go. Take Care.

I wish I could have a couple more weeks of summer vacation. Being a senior is going to be fun right? I hope this year goes by fast...I really do. Last night I stayed the night at Katie's house with Janna. We went to a softball game to watch Tiffany play. Her team got first place so that made me happy. It was a lot of fun watching drunk people play softball. I also sang karaoke with Janna, Stephanie, Angela, and some drunk guys. lol. We attempted to sing Sweet Home Alabama it didn't turn out very well, but it was still fun. When we got home I made a picture and colored it for Katie's dad. It took me about an hour and a half to finish it, but it was completely worth it. This morning he thanked me..told me that it was cute..and that I color good for a senior lol. I just hung out at my house, watched a couple movies, and played video games with my brothers. I'm at Janna's house right now playing on her computer while she takes a bath. We are going to stay up all night playing board games and just hanging out. I'm going to check my e-mail so I'll update again later. Goodnight everyone!"

It was a lot of fun, and it was also nice to hang out with everyone. I can't believe I have less than a week of summer vacation left it makes me sad, but at the same time very excited. I want to start my senior year and I want it to be over, but at the same time I really think I'm going to miss high school. Oh well, college will definitely be a lot more fun. There will be a lot more cute guys, new experiences, and of course parties! lol. Janna has been staying with me for a few days, but tonight she is staying with her friend Darcy so I'm staying with Tracie. Last night Janna and I went to Wal-Mart to get juice, but ended up getting Dr. Pepper, Sprite, cherry flavoring, cherries, cream cheese, salsa, corn chips, burritos, cookies and cream and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, and hot fudge. The whole reason we went out was to get juice, and we didn't remember to buy it. It's really not a good idea to go grocery shopping when you're hungry. =) So yeah, I didn't do anything that interesting this weekend. I just hung out with friends and watched movies. Tracie and I went to Kum And Go tonight to get something to eat and visit Kate. She's so nice. I'm a little sleepy so I hope what I'm writing about makes sense. lol.

The shopping part of the trip wasn't so bad I ended up finding some nice clothes and a few interesting books. After we were finished shopping we went back to my grandparent's house to pick up my uncle and go out to dinner at the Prairie Edge Casino and Resort in Granite Falls. We arrived at the hotel around 6:30 but we weren't seated until 7:45, because the restaurant was so busy. The whole time we were waiting Neil was freaking out because he wanted to go swimming and being loud. I thought for sure my family and I were going to be kicked out before we got the chance to eat. Danielle and I spent most of our time wondering around the hotel trying to find cute guys and avoiding our family. lol. The food was great but the service sucked, even though our waiter was a nice guy the restaurant was simply too busy to keep everyone happy. I think they were short on staff or something, but anyway when my mom laid a few dollars on the table for his tip my grandma picked it up right in front of him. She said, ""That queer doesn't deserve a tip!"" I couldn't believe what I heard coming out of her mouth, and it really pissed off my mom so she just walked away. I tried begging my grandma to put the money back down, but she wouldn't give in so I left the restaurant to find my mom. Danielle and I left our grandparents and uncle to find our mom in the arcade with our little brothers. I asked my mom for a few dollars and I went back to the restaurant with her to give him his tip. I still feel really embarrassed about the whole thing, but that wasn't even the worst part of the night. My sister, uncle, and grandpa got in a huge fight when we were home, because she wanted to go back to Brookings. The fight lasted for about ten minutes then my grandpa ended up yelling at her and told her to get out of his house, and that she was not welcome there anymore. So yeah we got home around midnight last night, but I was happy to be home. The library is closing in a few minutes so I have to go, but I'll try to get on the computer later tonight to tell everyone about today. Take care. Love Always, Karin."

I would have had a lot more fun if Janna was there though, because then we could have ""snuck out"" to the bar again. While was there I spent most of my time reading, playing with the kitty, thinking, and playing rummy. Lately, I've been reading a lot of books by Danielle Steel, and my favorite one so far is called ""The Ghost"". I've also been hanging out with friends, getting ready for school, and enjoying the last couple weeks of summer vacation left. I'm a little upset with my best friend Rey, but I'm not sure if I even want to tell him. Even though I'm upset with him right now, I miss him a lot, and I can't believe it has been a whole year since I last saw him. (Aug. 13th) When I tried talking to him in the first place he just frustrated and pissed me off. He told me that he really cares about me and everything, but sometimes I seriously don't think he is listening to me. I'm sure I'll talk to him soon and everything will be okay. I don't understand why friends and friendships have to be so difficult at times. *Sigh* I'm really sleepy so I'm going to go to bed. Sweet dreams. Love, Kar!

For those of you that don't know me, my name is Karin, I live in South Dakota, and I'm 17 years old. I'm not sure what to talk about so I guess I'll continue to tell you a little about myself. I have long blonde hair, greenish blue eyes, I'm 5'3, and I'm not exactly model thin, but I'm not an obese cow either! I love hanging out with my friends, laughing, traveling, watching movies, listening to music, reading, bowling, swimming, cooking, debating, experience new things...and being my usual bitchy, lovable self! So yeah, now I'll tell you about yesterday. I went to Sioux Falls with my friend Tiffany and her mom. It ended up being a lot of fun even though Tiffany is seriously one of the most difficult people to go shopping with, but I still love her. After I got home from Sioux Falls I tried to read my book, but my sister Dani wouldn't leave me alone. She kept on making these terrible, retard noises and looking at me with silly expressions. She annoyed me so much I had to have my friend Janna come rescue me from my evil siblings. I'm now happily safe at Janna's house staying the night. I'm going to head off to bed so I'll write again soon. Take care everyone. Love Always, Karin."

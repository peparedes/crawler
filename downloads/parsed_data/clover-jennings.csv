"event","BACK STORY FOR CLOVER LIKEWOAH.

Clover Jennings is a fifth year Hufflepuff. Her two best subjects are charms and history of magic(Which she loves for some reason, the world will never know.). She has a rather irrational fear of heights and rats(There are roughly twenty six mouse traps under her bed. Don't ask.), and will only attend quidditch games if she is dragged and/or bribed with candy. She also enjoys cooking and baking, though she'll occasionally try some pretty weird recipes that turn out to be... 'Interesting', to say the least. clover also loves to read for long periods, usually on some random topic that's sparked her interest.

She is a rather naive girl, and tends to see the world in black and white. She can't comprehend exactly <i>why</i> people would do evil things or be nasty, and tends to just ignore it for the most part. Clover is very shy when meeting new people, but after she warms up to them she becomes very bubbly and sometimes hyper, and is very loyal and protective of her friends. Though as stated she tends to be timid around people she doesn't know very well, she will put her foot down when needed.

Clover was adopted when she was nine months old by a muggle couple that had no idea about her powers. The identity of her biological parents is unknown, so it's basically impossible to know how much pure blood she has. She acts like a muggle born though, preferring many muggle activities to wizarding ones(Such as football/soccer to quidditch.).

So... Any takers?

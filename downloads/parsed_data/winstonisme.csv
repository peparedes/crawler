"event","well tyler dude you so could have called me. acutally why didnt you call me. but i guess thats okay. well i just heard that this kid from my first grade class died from a drunken car wreck. thats never good, its not that we were close friends or even friends at all but its still like a shock that someone the same grade as me died, i dont think any one in my grade has died that i know of, well this is a lesson dont drink and drive because accidents do happen and people do die its not a bunch of made up stuff taht parents and commercials say to scare you its true. just please remember this when your getting drunk andthen remember when your with someone who is drunk be a designated driver."

sorry i havent posted ive not been home and my thing was set to my ip only so i guess ill have to change it well yesterday pretty much sucked massive freakin cock. ok the day was going fine i woke up near 720 took a shower and was ready by 735 okay my mom pulls in the parking lot we both depart from the car as i was walking into school...before you cross the road in the back infront of the middle door was a penny. as you may remember yesterday was a dingy day and it was hard to see and i figured that since it was hard to see that the penny i found would be lucky, the penny i found was dark and had three black marks on either side the penny was cold and wet i clutched it and said mabye...just mabye this will be a good day...oh was i wrong...it all went good until about 4th block when i had to deal with my gay spanish teacher the day before i had told her to take a hike so things werent good between us first thing i had lost my notes and i was already pissed kortnee mehler came in there and started her everyday shit and i went off on her sorry kortnee.  then we had a vocabulary test that i bombed because i didnt have my notes as you know.  i had to hear andrew brag about his 102. okay and then my teacher gave us a bunch of activitys in the book she expects me to have a 6 page packet done she tells me that every single thing i dont have is due she gripes on me and i tell her i will give it to her monday she agrees and then 5 minutes before class i pull out my cellphone and play tetris.  she takes it from me and im like what the heck 5 minutes and were not doing anything im like okay you can give me that back now and shes like no so i finally get it back the rest of the day goes normal until about 645 when tyler says he will be here in 5 minutes and i have 5 min. to get ready well he picks me up and his bro drops us off at ruby tuesday.. we decide to walk to the movies to see what is playing then we decided to go get something to drink and some gum. i say dude i sure hope that penny doesnt haunt both of us tonight and hes like yea i know we buy ale8's cause that is like our drink only me and him.  and were at ruby tuesday i make reservations. we wait on them and make jokes saying that the old man beside of us is thinking were drinking heiniken. anyway they get there we eat and the tables turn for the better for aproximately 3 mintues...that was the best moment of my day, my week, my month, i dont know i was just having so much fun berry wars pictures just fun.  well we get to the movies and we buy ticket to a lot like love okay so we find seats and whitney and erin are like lets go outside so were like okay we were taking a picture against the indianna jones picture on the wall and some people came up so we went back into the movie (me and tyler) that is they come in and say lets go to a diff movie we knew kelvin and chad would be there and we didnt want to put up with kelvin so we were like no no no and they were like w/e so they left and we waited 10 min for them to return they didnt they were in the lobby talking to two guys and me and tyler were fed up with it and we just went back to the movie so we went into interpereter and a lot more stuff happened that only the people in the movie will know about and finally things started kindof going right but then they screwed up again. yea so i went home with mycousin i schooled him and someone else in risk fell asleep woke up and i got to level 42 in tetris for all those wondering...2241 lines.  today went okay the only bad thing was i didnt win the tshirt contest but the other guys was cool i guess. i think if was a neutral crowd i may have won but i only had 3 friends in the crowd so it was pretty much game over and to all that read this God Bless You thanks for caring about me and i needed someone to talk to but i guess i dont know so ill cya later

"event","hello,

all my friends i hope your day has gone well because mine kindof started off a little ruff okay so im sitting in second block, and my social studies teacher, Mr. Mcwhorter, was talking about sheriffs or w/e and im sitting there and i hear the U K fight song okay so i kind of start humming i find its my phone on the loudest volume so i grab for my pocket and pushed the button that automatically sent the call to my voicemail and to play it off i shouted go uk but my teacher was nice about it and just said give it here so i turned it off and gave it to him.  Him being the idiot he is decided to turn it back on and look at my phone book.  Puzzled he says ""BACON?"" andso i explain who that is not 5 seconds after he had said that my voice mail registered and then my voice mail song turned on... and that is ""I Walk a Lonely Road"" by Greenday under my breath i made a swear because i knewwhat was coming next it plays ""read beetween the lines""...thats when i started yelling out la la la...and my teacher was waving it around dancing to it...then it goes ""whats f**** up and everything is alright"" the song finished he gave me a strange look like what in the world is wrong with you boy. then he says why does your ringtone cuss and i go well the people at nextel did it.  I was scared that i was going to get saturday school by the way. So then he goes well why dont you change it and i said i do...everyday but so do the people in 3rd block...i thought noone was going to help then the kid in front of me goes hes not lieing.  Mcwhorter gave me one last look that could have killed and turned off the phone and slipped it in his pocket. (after class he gave me my phone along with a lecture) so in a plus or homeroom i decided that i would check the message that was left... it comes to find out that its a little old lady who said sorry i must have the wrong number.  I was so amazed at how much one little mistake had gotten me into so much trouble... oh yea in fourth block it was takin away also because i used it to call the orthodontist...well thats my story for now im going to a soccer game with tyler erin and whitney so im out...love you all

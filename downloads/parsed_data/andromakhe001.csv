"event","On IMDB, a regular poster and her husband have decided to start a donation drive for Jensen Ackles birthday.  It sounds like a great thing to celebrate the big day and something Jensen would probably appreciate much more than presents to himself.

<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/7zppwyx"">The original post is here, which I am copying and pasting below:</a>

<b>The husband and I have decided to donate to The Los Angeles Mission for the birthday gift. 

Here is what we can do to celebrate Jensen Ackles' Birthday.  

If anyone is interested please donate at your own volition. Follow the rules of The Los Angeles Mission page to donate.<i>(ed note: There is a big red donate button in the right top hand corner of the website)</i>   Email me that you've donated in honor of Jensen Ackles/Jensen Ackles' Birthday, if you'd like a shoutout on the birthday blog. If you'd like to send a birthday greeting I'll add that to the birthday blog up to 70 words. Please only pleasant comments. Please feel free to use a pseudonym if you're not comfortable with using your real name. Listing your donation is not required and is preferable. This is a gift. 


<a href=http://www.losangelesmission.org/Home.aspx>Los Angeles Mission Home Page</a>

 

<a href=http://celebrityhollywoodconnection.blogspot.com/2011/04/supernatural-articles.html> The birthday blog will be shown here.</a> 


My email address: Beowulfxox@yahoo.com. 

After you've donated, send me an email and use Birthday Gift as a header. 

If you have any questions please use Birthday Question as a header. 



This is not a planned and organized event and for that I apologize. Max and I are planning a more organized event later this year. We will try to find a way to inform Jensen Ackles of the blog, either through twitter or facebook (maybe Cliff's). 

Max and I are just two struggling actors, writers, and film makers who are inspired by Jensen Ackles. We wanted to do something special for him on his birthday. Hopefully we can do more in the future. 



Thank you for your time.</b>"

There is still time to donate to Team Levi, the Buddy Walk Team in honor of Jensen's nephew with Down's Syndrome.

<a href=""https://bos.etapestry.com/fundraiser/DownSyndromeGuildofDallas/BuddyWalk2011/individual.do?participationRef=607.0.365406309"">The donation page is here.</a>  Jensen asks very little of his fans and it's a great way to give just a little bit back to a good cause.  The donations can be as small or as large as you want.

Young actress Madison McLaughlin had a great on set experience with Jensen Ackles that included Jensen and the SPN Crew singing Happy Birthday to help her celebrate her Sweet 16, including a cake.  Here is the video:

She also tweeted some wonderful words about working with Jensen and a great picture:

"event","Just thought I would do a little update.  These are some nice video interviews featuring Jensen which I've come across thanks to the other Dean and Jensen fans over the last week since Comic Con.  I'm going to embed or post links to some of them.  

Lately, I've been trying to remember to comment on any interviews I find either on youtube or on the official website from which they were posted, just to let the interviewers know I appreciate them interviewing Jensen Ackles and hope they will do it again whenever they have another opportunity. :)  Especially because Jensen so often comments on the whole show and is sure to mention what is going on with other characters. I admire that he considers the show as a whole so often in his interviews.  So click on the videos, go to the sites and if you are able to, say thanks to them for talking to Jensen Ackles. :)

Pass any of 'em along that you like. :)

This is a nice one from The Ugly Couch Show, which not only features Jensen Ackles, but also Jim Beaver and Misha Collins. Jensen appears again after the end of Misha's interview so watch the whole thing. I agree with Jensen, Dean needs to be kicking ass, taking names and saving people from the bad guys(as soon as he gets the Impala fixed up!)

<lj-embed id=""114""/>

<lj-cut text=""More Interviews with the gracious Jensen Ackles behind the cut"">

This is a nice, long interview at one of the press tables. If you like The Ackles&#39; lovely profile, this one is for you.  It is filmed, close up from the side. :)


<lj-embed id=""115""/>




Digital Spy is a site that often has little mentions of Jensen and the show so it would be nice to thank them if you get the chance. :)
<lj-embed id=""116""/>





Hollywood Reporter had a nice interview with him too and Hollywood Reporter is a major entertainment site.  He says some lovely things about Colin Ford(young Sam). You can comment on youtube and <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/comic-con-2011-supernatural-panel-214781"">on the Hollywood Reporter website too.</a>

<lj-embed id=""117""/>



Movieweb also has an interview.
<lj-embed id=""92""/>




This is a link to the Sky TV interview, first up is Jensen, then Misha and Jim.  

<a href=""http://tv.sky.com/supernatural"">Sky TV Comic Con 2011 interview with Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver and Misha Collins</a>




The interview done by Give Me My Remote blog is at the same table as the 2nd video above but from a different angle.  Instead of his perfect profile, his fantastic face. :)

<lj-embed id=""118""/>



*ADDED VIDEO*
The Futon Critic also has an interview with Jensen up.  Just found it, thanks to a link elsewhere to a youtube copy of it someone made, but this one is at the original site as I feel it's important to link to the originating site if possible so the site managers can see who is getting them hits, which might encourage future interviews. :)

Round 2 of <a href=""http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b232285_alpha_male_madness_2011_who_will_rise.html"">E!'s Alpha Male Madness Poll</a> is underway. 

You can vote as often as you want in this poll, so the more frequently you vote the better.

They are out to get Jensen this time. I've seen posters in the comments saying ""You have to vote against Jensen Ackles if you want your guy to have a chance of winning in the end"".  Which means a lot of people are going to be voting against him so they don't have to risk their own choice going against him in a future round.

This round of the poll lasts until Thursday March 24 at 2PM PST.  If anyone wants to get together some campaign materials like pictures and animated gifs of Dean being awesomely badass that would be great. :)  We have plenty of examples to choose from.

So vote Jensen Ackles and get everyone you know to vote for Jensen too.

"event","<font color=""blue"">Hi all, I just thought I'd gather together some of the Paley Festival interview links from this past weekend, particularly the Jensen centric ones.

This first one is from the panel where Jensen talks about not being that interesting. What is hysterical is the way he plays out his reactions:

<lj-embed id=""123""/>

<lj-cut text=""More behind the here"">

Some of these videos contain some of the same information as other ones just taken from different angles and with better quality but they are all worth watching. I may have missed some spoilers because, as a spoiler whore, I can't always tell what is a spoiler and what isn't but I did try to label them. :)  

And of course spread the love and post any of these to anyone you want. And remember if you have accounts, give the uploaders(and Jensen) some positive comments in the comments sections if there is one. :)

Very nice interview where at the end he talks about the Days of Our Lives clip in The French Mistake.  Danielle Turchiano who does the interview is a long time Jensen supporter, from back in hisDOOL days, she currently writes on Made Possible by Pop Culture, so give her a lot of support. PS check out the look he gives at 2:19 and try not explode:) :

If you get a chance to post on the March Madness thread, and feel like posting pictures, post pictures and gifs of all the stuff that makes Dean awesome.  We all can see how gorgeous he is, but he's also endearing, goofy, funny.    He also loves his mom and his brother and of course his new angel friend. :)  He is also dangerous and kick-ass(and athletic;)) as well.  We gotta make sure it's all represented.

"event","I don't normally post about an episode, I've never done it before in my own LJ but I was insulted by this episode's treatment of Dean.

Dean needs an attitude adjustment?  ""Stop whining about it""?

The man was tortured in HELL.  For DECADES. That is on top the childhood he never had because his obsessed father didn't take responsibility for his own kids and left it up to Dean to take of himself, take of his brother and take care of said obsessed father.

Dean's whole life has been devoted to ""saving people and hunting things"".  Did Sera just forget that?  Or did she think we'd forget it?

Do you say a returning POW he needs to just get over it and stop whining?  Would anyone, in this day and age, think that was acceptable?

What is this?  WWI?  Where guys with shell shock were treated as cowards who just wanted to get out of going to the front?

We got that powerful episode last week and Sera Gamble follows it up with Dean needs to stop whining?

Dean's whole life he's ""gotten over it"", he's ""not whined"" - and after being through what he went through, THAT is what Sera Gamble considers a ""pep talk"", that's what she thinks is a ""boost"" to his self-esteem.  Being told once again, it doesn't fucking matter how you feel, just shut up and do your job.

I am so pissed off right now.  Literally, it made me cry.  And not like Dean made me cry last week.

ETA:  It's not that I don't think last week should have been ""rock bottom"", I want Dean to start his uphill climb.  I do think this is what he's meant to do and he's strong enough and he can do it.  But this...this was just an insulting way to do it.  No one ever told Sam to ""just stop whining"" and Dean's been through all he has and THIS is what Sera comes up with?  

How much better would it have to have the angel put them in this situation and have him, HIMSELF, start to think something was wrong, without the pushing? Both he and Sam can come to the same conclusions seperately and end up working together.  And then no big, guilt inducing attempted speech from Sam but instead Dean, on his own, just turns down Adlers offer when Adler offers him the raise and promotion.  And Adler leaves it at that.  Gives him his memory back, tells him the bit about how this is what he was meant to do, he'd find his way to it in the dark and left it at that."

"event","This is a rant.  Feel free to ignore.

I realize there have been errors in the first 2 issues of the Rising Son Supernatural comic series but the 3rd has errors which really put me over the top.

First what we know from the show.  Dean was a crack shot when John put a gun in his hands at 6 years old(No Exit).  Dean was building his own shotgun in 6th grade(Bad Day at Black Rock).  Dean was already quite familiar with using a shotgun at 9 years old(Something Wicked). 

This comic would have us believe that Dean at no younger than around 12 1/12 year old would have no idea what to do when shooting at a deer and would complain about the gun being too heavy!?!?!  This is the kid whose father was regularly leaving him alone with a shotgun that he fully expected him to be able to use to protect himself and his younger brother by the time he was NINE! And I'm supposed to believe that John had never taught him how to use a gun by shooting at real moving targets? 

Even if believed that John hadn't done more than had Dean shoot at bottles until he was 9 years old(which I don't), I'd never believe that, after the events of Something Wicked, John never had Dean practice ""for real"" given his slight hesitation in shooting at the Shtriga(which to me was understandable, it was right over his brother, he wouldn't want to miss and shoot Sam by accident). 

I don't think Peter Johnson has actually ever watched the show since the Pilot.  He seems to have no idea who Dean actually is, what actually motivated him or even what happened in his life. He has completely screwed up the psychology of the characterization in such a way that makes it non-canon in and of itself. He even has a ""seer"" character say Dean is like John when the show itself has gone through some pains to show that John and Sam are actually the two who were very much alike since around mid-Season 1."

"event","Okay I have to comment on this asinine ""Dean is misogynistic"" stuff that's going around after the finale:


You are kidding right?

Dean didn't hit a woman, he hit a DEMON. He insulted a demon. Why? Because it works, because he wanted to get the knife away from said demon. It was a SET UP. He didn't hit her because she called him a dick. He hit her because he wanted to get her under the Devil's Trap and because he wanted to pick her pocket of said knife. He insulter her so she'd insult him(because he knows from past experience that it works), which in turn would give him an excuse to hit her in a way that she wouldn't suspect was just a trap to get the knife away. Guess what, it worked. Yay for SmartDean!

Holy fracking hell, do people even pay attention to the show or are they just looking for reasons to get up on their high horse? So what if he called her a slut or a skank? She's a demon, he's never called a ""real woman"" that. He's never treated any real women badly at all, unless she has been a bad person. A demon is living in a human being's body, they are a parasite, they are living off another and often causing that body's death. And the fact that Ruby hasn't acted like the dictionary definition of ""slut"" or ""skank""(though personally I think a case can definitely be made for skank - eta: which means someone disgustingly foul and I think doing what she's done is just that) shows that Dean isn't saying it because of her or anyone else's sexuality, he's just saying it as a general insult that works. 

And no having one night stands with women is not misogynistic or sexist, they are doing the same with him. We have seen women hit on Dean(go right back to Dead in The Water, the waitress was totally hitting on him with come hither smiles, so that's right at the start of the show and it has been the case ever since). We have seen women want to have sex with Dean. Clearly this is a two way street here. As it would be. Dean Winchester looks like Jensen Ackles and frankly I am quite sure that man has never had a shortage of women wanting to jump his bones so neither would Dean Winchester. 

In point of fact Dean has shown a great deal of respect towards strong women on many occasions on this show. What he doesn't show respect for are nasty terrible woman and neither does he show respect for nasty terrible men. If anything he shows more respect to female authority figures than he has for male ones. 

As for Bela--she wasn't just an annoying human being, she was willing to leave them for dead(BDABR--she knew it would kill them and she just didn't care), she shot Sam, she stole from them(hand, lottery tickets), she sent their worst enemy after them(Gordon, it's not bad that she told him where they were but it's incredibly bad that she just ""forgot"" to call them and no I don't buy the ""Oh but it's just one guy"", it was ""just one guy"" that wanted to kill them and whom they didn't know was coming), then she turned them into the FBI, where Dean was wanted for capital offenses, which means he was pretty certain to get the death penalty and very likely Sam as well at this point. 

And then at the end--she was going to shoot them dead in their beds to save herself. No I have no sympathy for how she ended up, she did that to herself. It wasn't her deal at 14 that made her deserving of Hell, it was all her actions afterwards, which were self-serving, greedy, and often deadly to others in her path.

So I'm sorry but I think whoever you are and whereever you are, you are entirely wrong. 

I think Dean has shown time and again that he likes women, respects women and doesn't look upon women any differently than he looks upon men, both for better and for worse. 

Dean has been insulted and called names and put down by demons, male and female, on this show since it started. He's had the crap beaten out of him by them, been almost killed by them(and now killed by them) repeatedly. Dean hitting a Demon in a FEMALE body is not Dean hitting a woman. They have demonically enhanced strength. And neither is his calling them names, no matter what the names, showing any dislike for actual human women.

ETA:  Ellie made a great point below I wanted to make but got distracted from - the demon in Ruby's body is committing something that is tantamount to rape, every day she was in that body.  So calling RubyDemon a skank and a slut, is a very small price to pay for what she has done to that body by possessing it.  This is not ""poor wittle Wuby the helpful demon"". This is a demon who has forcibly seized control of some poor young woman, who is now most likely dead(we know she has been shot point blank in the chest) due to that posession."

"event","Addresses to write to ABC's Lost in support of Jack and Kate. :)  ETA:  And now that we've had our beautiful moment in the jungle, the kiss, it's especially important to make sure they know how many of us are rooting for Jack and Kate. :)

Be polite, be positive, tell them what you like about Jack and Kate together(their chemistry, the cosmic connection, the respect they show each other, the way they have each other's best interests at heart, whatever it is). Letters and postcards count as hundreds of viewers.  If you take the time to write them a letter or note, they are more likely to take your opinion seriously.  

Also, it's a good idea, though not strictly necessary, to send a copy of your letter or postcard to more than one of these addresses, because if it is lost or thrown away or just generally ignored at one place, it will likely still make it through at another.

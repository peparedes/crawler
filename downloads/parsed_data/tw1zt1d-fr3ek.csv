"event","so i finished all my work at like 9:00 this morning and now i am surfing the web, listening to music, and, obviously, updating my journal.  it's really shitty outside and i would imagine it will not be too long before the rain arrives.  i think today will be an all day jonah-fest in celebration of my re-aquisition of the gratitude album.  i got my file server back up on mirc tuesday night and it has been doing quite well.  i've had several responses to my advertisement of shadeland on myspace and hope to get some folks to buy their new cd.  if you're interested in perusing my selection, look for the user kn1fparty in the following channels on EFnet:  #emometalmp3, #mp3absolute, and #rockscene."

"event","beautiful day today.  it's a shame i was stuck in an office for the vast majority of it.  on the flip side i did get quite a bit of work done, so it wasn't all bad.  rocked out to some coheed at my desk and cranked out a couple reports before lunch.  i decided on friday i needed to move my desk so i couldn't hear our secretary's bogus radio station pumping out the same garbage rap songs non-stop all frigging day.  yes, fucking trick daddy and 50 cent on repeat for 8 hours got really annoying months ago, if you can believe that.  i really need to convince my old man that it would be a shame to waste such a perfect golfing day tomorrow, as the forcast calls for temperatures in the mid-60's and clear skies.  anywho, i guess i'm done here."

"event","spring has sprung, people.  time for barbecues, beer, sublime, golf, outdoor shows, drive-in movies, and country cruises with the windows down.  oh, to have an endless supply of corona.  the stuff dreams are made of."

"event","so anyways...it's been way too long since i've filled everyone in on my experiences in this crazy random world.  last week i purchased an additional hard drive for all of my wonderful music, as i have grown weary of digging through a stack of discs whenver i wish to listen to something.  i celebrated my musical liberation by listening to both coheed albums and i started getting a little sentimental.  yes, it is true, i miss those good times had by all in the residence of one Mr. Jackson.  Many a night of great spiritual energy combined with alcohol induced euphoria were spent hanging with good people and listening to good tunes.  this is a period of time which i hold dear, as real people with thoughts and ideas on an uncannily similar plane with my own are a rare find.  those people who contributed to those fun filled evenings know who you are, and you have my ""gratitude""."

"event","what happens inside our heads while we sleep? tiny bits of light slip through our eyelids, granted access by rapid eye movement (REM). the ocular nerves then take these shards of illumination and send them to the brain as electrical signals. the brain then interprets these signals to create images which we call dreams. this is the exact same process by which we see things in hour waking hours. this makes me wonder...will 2 different people sleeping in the same exact place with the same exact light exposure and eye movement patterns have the same exact dreams? not likely, say you? and why not? does the fact that no 2 brains are identical mean that each individual interprets the signals sent from the eyes differently? i would imagine so. and does the fact that no 2 eyeballs are identical create some variations in the signals that they send to the brain? of course. and so, with those points in mind, would it seem possible that 2 people looking at the same exact object, could see 2 entirely different things?"

"event","so yeah, new gratitude tracks on the prp. ownage. with that in mind, let us turn our thoughts to the long awaited and always welcome arrival of the splendid fall season. i must say that it could not have come at a better time. 80 degree weather is just not for me. i like to be able to go outside without fear of spontaneous human combustion. i hear that is rather unpleasant. so it is time once again for jeans and hoodies...the stuff dreams are made of. there are few things in this world more enjoyable than a good hoodie on a brisk autumn evening. put yourself next to a bonfire with some cold beers and ""voila!""...perfection. we are now one step closer to removing the dust bunnies from my snowboard, the thought of which puts an evil grin on my face and a song in my heart. an evil song."

"event","As it was written...so shall I be...in attendance for the Deftones show, that is.  Jeremy has sparked my curiosity in Dredg's live performance, and now I will get to see for myself what all the hubbub is about.  Should be a good time.  The wife has never seen the Tones and she's pretty excited, which is probably the only reason I'm going, lol."

"event","So I was looking through some pictures this morning and found a few shots of the old band.  That was a good time.  Oh how I do miss playing with others.  Neil and I jammed out for a little bit last week and that was nice.  Don was in the pictures too, lol, which sucked, but what can you do.  Ha, that guy...what an oddball.  I need to invest in a PA, nothing fancy, maybe a little Kustom or something cheap like that.  My microphone has been collecting dust...not cool."

"event","Wow, was this past week funn! Camping I have concluded is not my thing at all!! It was tough to camp for a whole week with only taking one shower. If you know me, you know how I take 2 showers a day or at least one a day. It was tough waking up having to just throw up your hair and don't care. Also, I was scared out of my mind at night. I hate animals, especially possums so I kept waking up all night long, every night. I would nudge Frank the first night of camping like 200 times because I was scared. Yah, he was mad. So I quit after that and just layed there still, scared the following nights, trying not to wake him up. The second night of hiking we camped down in the forrest and I saw like 3 bear poops around our campsite, so yahh. I was not sleeping good that night. One night on the Rafting part of the trip there was big cat prints in the sand, they said it could be a mountain lion or an Kudyamondi (like a lemur) don't know how to spell that. That night was scary. I woke up in the middle of the night and could of sworn I heard cat growls. Woke up frank, because I was terrified and yah it was about 2 people snoring in the other tents. I felt stupid. hahaha

Hiking section was tough. We had hiked nearly 20 miles the first two days. We hiked not just on flat ground but mostly up and down hill the whole time. It wore me out considering I didn't prepare for the intensity. On top of all the hard hiking we had barley any food, which sucked. For lunch the first day after hiking through 4-feet of snow we had crackers, salami, and cheese to split between 10 people. Yah, it was not good. Other than that, the hiking part was long but fun. Carrying a 50 pound bag wasn't fun but it was definatly an adventure. 

The rafting section was a blast. Our guide, although a bit annoying was an extreme adventurer and always wanting to go for the Huge waves. The first rapids we went through I was sooo nervous thinking I would fall out. I didn't fall out at all, although I was close at falling one time. It was fun to actually be down in the Grand Canyon and see how HUGE it is. You can see the oldest rock in the world from the pre-cambrien era down there...it looks almost like metal, neat!!! It was funn!! The food was better because we could carry stoves and stuff on the extra boats. We had mexican night with burrito's\rice\beans\tequilla shots on the river, and grilled chicken\salad\potatoe wedges. Our river guides were awesome, just so much fun. The end of the trip wasn't the greatest because it was cold, raining on us, and huge waves just kept splashing us. Overall, I enjoyed it and definatly going rafting again. 

Grand Canyon WOW!! If you havn't seen it, you need to! But..don't just see the Canyon from the top try to get down in it, get a permit to go rafting, or hiking because it is totally different being on top and then being down in it. 

Well, my trip was a blast. I have ton's of pictures I plan on somehow scanning them on my computer to show if anyone wants to see, but who knows when that will be, because I have ALOT to do now. Well, I will keep writing...later."

"event","Well, we had our meeting wednesday night about the Grand Canyon Hiking\water rafting trip and found out some disappointing news. There was a huge rain storm that went across the Grand Canyon and made a huge landslide across our trail we were supposed to hike on. Figures huh?? So, we arn't able to use that trail and in order to get another trail you have to go through the government months ahead for a permit. Sooo...we are backpacking other areas I think around the Grand Canyon and possibly doing the tourist hike deal there instead of in the wilderness of the Canyon. Which I guess is good because we will be staying at a campsite with showers and bathrooms. Shower + Bathrooms = PERFECT FOR ADRIAN! Anyways, we still get to go Water Rafting in the Grand Canyon river, so that's going to be set it stone. No matter what we are going to have a blast, and we now won't just see the grand canyon but like a cactus forest and such places. Im excited!!!! I will take tons of pictures to show everyone interested!!

To all my girls back at home...I miss ya'll and will call you this coming week during the day to catch up with you all!"

"event","Well sorry everyone. I meant to keep this journal to let everyone know what's happening but I have had like noooo time latley. I have school, and started waitressing again, and with all that it's been crazy! Im glad I am back at work because I made 350 dollars last week just in TIPS!!!! Isn't that crazy?? I work like 8-10 hours every sunday which wears the ""shindig""(don't know where that word came from) outta me but it's worth making 120 dollars. Well, we have our meeting about the Grand Canyon Spring break trip tonight. I finally get to see who all else will be going on this. I hope it's cool people and not foreigner's!!! It's so nice today I should of walked to the lake and ran, but yahh I feel asleep studying nutrition! I have been doing my ab-lounge though, so I didn't completely stop working out haha (yeah!). So....I have A's in all my classes, as of mid-term grades, which makes me happy. I got accepted into OU about 2 weeks ago, so that's where I will be moving to and transferring to next Fall. Im excited, yet sad, because I love OSU and it's soooo pretty!!!! I have been sick the past week with some virus that's floating around. Talking about miserable time to get sick when I have had three tests this week. Yah, not fun! I also had to pay 400 dollars for my spring break trip and didnt have any income because I was sick and I wasn't able to work the WHOLE week! So yah, pretty miserable again.  

OKLAHOMA STATE BASKETBALL TEAM #4 IN COUNTRY!!! YAY! We play A&M tonight at 6pm, which will be a sinch!! haha sorry Dana! Actually I don't know if A&M is any good or not. Im hoping OSU goes to the final four and win's it all this year, since we suck at football. If you watch the game, be sure to see our coach's face, Eddie Sutton. He's soo hillarious. He always has his lip sticking out like he's frowning. WATCH and you will laugh. 

Well, I will try to keep this up to date. YAY Spring break is in two weeks!!!! Love you all, especially my baby Frank aka as my sis would call him Frankfurt (no idea where that came from)! Ohh my sis' birthday is MARCH 12th, she turns 18...she's excited. She's getting old! Anyways, later!"

"event","Well, as bored as I have been I decided to just search OSU's website. I found a website about outdoor recreational trips and saw they had a trip planned for Spring Break. It was a trip to go Hiking , camping and River Rafting in the Grand Canyon!!!! I thought ""That would be sooooo much funn!"" Then memories came about the camping trip with a bunch of us girls my summer of senior year and remembered how I didn't like it too good. We were even in a ""cabin"" and had showers and bathrooms near. This trip there is no cabin, no restrooms or anything, which is a bummer but then I got to thinking that well this will be an adventure out of the ordinary at least for me. Soooo...I talked my wonderful boyfriend, Frank to go with me and he agreed. YAY! 

WE ARE GOING ON A HIKING, CAMPING AND RIVER RAFTING TRIP IN THE GRAND CANYON!!!

Anyways, I guess you have realized I am sooo excited about this. Ohh and it's cheap. For OSU students it only costs 400 dollars which includes transportation and food for the whole week. The sucky thing about it is..that we leave that first saturday and come back the day before school starts again. Ohh welll...this will be a trip to remember!! I will take LOTS of pictures to share ;) !!! 

Well, off to work in about 2 hours. Soo..gotta run for now. I will try and keep up to date with this. Later everyone!!"

"event","Heyy people...I figured I would do this journal thing to kind of keep up to date on my life for friends, incase they wanted to know whats going on, since I have been so dang busy. Well, for people that don't know, I live in Stillwater, Oklahoma and attend Oklahoma State University. I was going for a BA in Architecture, but after being in studio from 3am till about 5pm, I was sick and tired of it. It stressed me out, and I decided I dont want to do that my WHOLE life. Soo...now my major is Psychology. I plan on getting a PH.D in Clinical or Child Psychology. It'll be fun. You guy's can come to me if your sad or what not, talk about it, and shoot you will be cured!!! Haha, I guess you will see! 
Yahh, well I made stew yesterday with a butt load of vegetables. I was peeling potatoes and cut my knuckle on one of my fingers. OUCH and it hurts like heck!!!It's like high of 40 here this week, so I figured stew would be mighty good! Well, I have to study French, psych and philosophy...so I will keep this up to date.

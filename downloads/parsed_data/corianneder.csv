"event","I AM DONE CHEMISTRY FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

no more carbon, no more cobalt, no more iron, or hydrogen, or nitrogen, no more coordination complexes, or spins, or ligands, or k, or reaction pathways. I never have to worry about oxidation numbers or charges, lab coats or goggles, acids or bases, colour changes or precipitations. Alas I will not miss lab notes, reports, or quizes, nor will I long for writing imposible tests and memorizing compound after compound, or bonding configuration after bonding configuration. I NEVER have to draw an molecular orbital or crystal field splitting diagram ever again!

Today is a Happy Day. Chemistry you will not be missed.

Congrats to me!

So tomorrow night we are getting drunk. Come one come all!"

"event","So despite the fact that my life is practically perfect in every way, awesome friends, decent grades/fun classes, the most amazing man a girl could ask for, a nice little apartment, and a relatively happy family...I find myself horribly disconnected and well quite frankly lonely. I don't know when I stopped being able to talk to people but recently I just feel like I need to suck it up because I have everything and the crap that bothers me isn't important (I told you emo). I just feel like I have no one to talk to (so here I am talking to the entire internet seems like a reasonable solution, and no I'm not doing this to get posts being all like ""ohh its okay we still love you blah blah blah"" because I know people care, its just for some reason I can't talk to them in person I just don't know what to say.

So at this point you might be thinking, what about that incredable guy mentioned before, well the thing is I do talk to him about everything, but who do I talk to about him? I mean just because he is wonderful doesn't mean we don't have issues. For example, I know we haven't been dating that long, but man does it feel so much better than I ever thought a relationship could. So where's the problem? Well I just feel like I've invested so much more emotionally into this relationship than he has, and I don't blame him, but I also can't help how I don't want to move to fast and ruin everything because yes I have strong feelings but that doesn't mean I know what I want from them! I can't talk to him or ask him how he feels because I don't want to freak him out and I we have into this relationship because of work and school etc. So bottom line is I just wish I could find a way to get inside his head sometimes so I knew where I stood because I'm in pretty deep hear and I'm afraid of getting hurt.

I would talk to my friends about this but I feel like sometimes they think I shouldn't be complaining because I have this amazing relationship and well that should be enough, and it is, most of the time. Plus they are busy with their own problems, and more importantly I just don't feel like I am on the same wavelength as anyone I know right now.

That's really what it all boils down to, I don't feel like anyone gets me right now and vice versa. Either people are planning on moving away and going to school, or moving back home, or continuing at school, or starting their careers, they aren't where I am. I know some of these things haven't even happened yet, but its already been put into motion and I can feel everyone shifting already and I just feel like where does this leave me? and more importantly who does this leave me with?

So ya thats whats going on with me about 20% of the time the rest of the 80% I am fully enjoying about my life is everything I could every ask for and how well things are unfolding. Don't say I didn't warn you, I just needed to get some stuff off my back and well tell people how I feel in the most indirect and inefficient way possible.

PS some of my sanity returns the night of Dec 20th when I am officially done chemistry FOREVER! We are celebrating and I am going to be a drunken mess. If you care to join me the more the merrier!"

"event","Last night I served Evlis coffee. He takes it black. Okay so it wasn't sequin jumpsuit karate chopping Elvis, but it was the guy who played Elvis in the Walk the Line. He is also is on One Tree Hill, and thats really why I recognized him (yes I watch One Tree Hill and if you find a show with a better season finally you tell me, I mean 4 possible pregnancy's and 3 possible deaths, like whoa) anyways the point of this story is there was a C list celeb at my work last night and it was very exciting (not as exciting as the time Neko Case came to my work but still exciting), yes my work is very very boring sometime, expecially lately. Best part is I couldnt' get over the fact that his character on One Tree Hill is a huge jack ass, and while I'm sure he's actually a very nice person, I just kept on thinking what a hige jerk he was and how could he do all the horrible and overly dramatic things has has done over that last season. Ya I know I rule. 

In other Free Times news, I think we have figured out who my secret craigs list poster might be (for anyone who doesn't know there was a missed connections posted for ""The red haired waitress at Free Times"" and pretty much said my piercing was cool but they were too shy to talk to me). And I'm pretty sure he's harmless and isn't plotting to kill me or building shrines or anything. Which is a big relief. Though I still don't know for sure, and well its kind of fun not knowing and is a really good story to tell."

1. When I'm nervous about passing a class, I spend way to much time calculating exactly what mark I need on the exam to pass the class. I also do this during the exam. This is only weird because I tend to do all the math without a calculator, aka a lot of long division. Note I need 34% on my exam this afternoon to pass the class.
2. When I'm thinking really hard or am nervous I clench my teeth really hard and get headaches.
3. I also giggle when I'm nervous, so if I laugh at your bad jokes I'm probably just nervous and have lack of anything better to do.
4. I know what a zeolite is (sort of).
5. I play the flute but no one has ever heard me play except Dan. And drunk playing doesn't count.
6. I never remember my dreams if I sleep through the night. The only time I have a chance of recalling anything is if I wake up in the morning and go back to sleep in an hour or two. When I do dream there usually never more than one or two people I know in my dreams, everyone else I know in the dream but don't exist in real life. It weirds me out a little.

"event","So I have been feeling very nostalgic lately, and its making my kind of sad. I have been listening to a lot of my old CDs lately as I load ones I still like onto the old ipod and its weird all the memories they have. I mean old Alkaline Trio, the Plain White T's, remember seeing them and thinking they were awesome and then playing them while playing basket ball after school with Jeremey, Jude, Jenn, Carla, Sam etc. I just miss fun. I miss not being so tired all the time and having so much work to do. I miss not spending so much time alone. I miss driving around in Jenn's car, haing out in dorm rooms, going over to friends houses after school, the park, everyone visiting Amanda and my room in Chestnut, being on Fire duty and just yelling for no reason. It weird its like everyone here just stays in their rooms now and no one hangs out anymore. Mostly b/c we are all so busy and tired, but I dunno things have changed. Become more serious. While at the time I'm sure we thought our problems were huge, and everything is going wonderfully now, it seems less carefree. In some ways I like it, I lik ebeing independant, and out of my parenst house, and at school, but I miss the closness to people. I don't want to go back to high school or first year or even the begining of last year but I miss parts of all of it. There's just a feeling thats gone and I think things are getting too serious too fast. Then again maybe its just the music, or the mood I am in. All the same I am rambling now, but I can't explain whats wrong because nothing is wrong so to speak, something just isn't right."

"event","I have decided to compare how people talk in Toronto (born and raised) vs those in the Kawartha Lakes (preferably those with little influence from living anywhere else aka Toronto).

I may have to settle for some people who have lived in Toronto for a short while and I really dont need that many people. At least one male and female from the 16-20ish generation, and a male and female from the 45-55ish generation from each location, though as long as the numbers are even I can use as many people as I want.

If I have time I will also look at people who have moved to Toronto and have lived here for a few years like Matt and Dan.

So I have some people in mind but if you know anyone who would be willing to do short interview, you would just answer questions and read word lists, that fits these qualifications. Please let me know asap!

Feel free to ask me any further questions. Also if you have any comments on differences you have noticed btw speakers in these communities please share since I am not sure what aspect of speech I want to look at yet.

You never know I could discover something that could put us all in the socialinguistics textbooks for year to come. Don't act like its not something you've secretly dreamed about."

"event","so much has happened today before 11 am, not all of it was exciting but still more than my average day.

so i finally get up at 7:30 am after a night of not sleeping b/c Dan's pillows are too poofy and Tae decided not to sleep and I could hear him printing stuff and slamming doors all night, but I was so close to sleep I didn't want to move incase I was just abotu to fall asleep.

regardless I finally get up and have all intentions of reading over my notes aka watching saved by the bell and eating breakfast before my exam. Then Chiedza comes in looking sketchy though thats not out of the ordinary and I thought she was just going to say hi, grab the phone and preceed to talk on it all day when she sits down and asks me to call an ambulance for her.

so now I'm concerned and ask why, turns out she took 40 asprin last night while drinking and now can't seem to breath, not to mention she's really high and out of it. so as I'm deciding whether or not to call 911 as its an emergancy but she is conscious so are flashing lights and cops and fire departments necessary or what? then matt came down and I tell him whats going on and he thinks to call amanda and she being the smart one tells us to call poison control or the hospital, since she could get asprin poisoning. so matt calls the hospital thankfully b/c I need to get ready for my exam at 9. EMS comes and Joanne being the awesome person that she is says she will go with Chiedza since I have an exam and Matt has to work. Yup so that was a little overly intense for the start of my day.

I then preceed to write an exam and grocery shop all before 11 am. 

Okay so it got less exciting as the morning proceeded but still its a lot to do in one morning."

"event","mwahahaha, I just wrote my roommates an angry/bitchy note telling them to pay rent or I'm giving their rooms away. Yup I'm tired of being taken for granted. I mean I wish we could all get along but no one gives a fuck about anything around here anymore, at least not anyone else. Its mostly Tae and Chiedza, I could seriously due without babysitting those too anymore. I mean they can't seem to pay rent, wash a dish, be tidy, and are consantly tying up the phone lines or smoking in their rooms.

Despite all this I still love the fort, mostly my room, and the rest of the people, though I wish I saw more of them. We aren't nearly as close anymore and I miss it despite that fact that it is equally my fault. I think my new years resolution is going to be simply put ""more effort"" aka more effort to being a better friend, less of a pushover, maybe a better student though I'm kicking ass in that department, and a better grilfriend even though I think everything is super awesome as far as Dan and I go. 

Its weird b/c this has been one of the best late summers/falls. I am really happy, but I see so much potential for more. I guess what I want is last fall with this fall, last fall was more friends fort fun, this one has been more about me, if I find a balance btw the two my head may explode from awesomeness.

Like I said though, things are great right now. I'll be happier when exams are done but who wouldn't be? Dan and I just had a weekend in the BR where I met Crystal and Jess, two of his oldest friends, then headed back to Toronto for a bake off/birthday celebration at his sisters. Good weekend + lots of new people and haning out with dan's family without dan = tired (but happy) cori.

"event","So here is my delema: 

I have recently really started to get annoyed with the bands who practice/jam in my house for a few reasons
1) they are fucking loud b/c Jesse and Sam bought new amps and left them at our house, these amps are big and thus loud and seem to need to be cranked louder than I feel is necessary
2) there has been a band practice or jam at least once a day everyday since sunday
3) I am sick, and often would like to be quietly watch TV or read in my room without getting a headache, something that has been impossible lately
4) I miss comming home to a quiet house to relax in after work or class, or a busy Sunday afternoon, I can't remember the last time I watched Sunday night TV without having to blare it over the Burnitdowns

Now don't get me wrong, I like the music, and I really think its cool that the guys I know are musicians and musically creative, I just feel its gotten excessively often and LOUD!

So why haven't I said anything? A few reasons really
1) people will be mad and take it the wrong way and be mad at me which I hate, I don't want to create a rift btw me and my friends.
2) Tyler in in two of these bands and will assume it is really b/c I hate him, which for the record I never have, and will think I am doing this out of spite. This is petty and stupid but will still bother me and probably provoke him to do it more.
3) The boys are poor and can't afford to rent a practice space.
4) Its Matty's house too and he shoudl be able to play if he wants to.

So what do I do? Do I suck it up, talk to them despite the fact that they will probably hate me, or be a huge bitch and throw a tantrum?

"event","Saw the Get Up Kids last night. Last show in Canada ever and probably their most fun, making it a pretty bittersweet ending. Though I think the sweet outweighed the bitter. Not only did the play Woodson which was unexpected but easily one of my favorites, but the encore was amazing, sing alongs and crazy dance parties is how every show would end. Then again not every show had the vibe this one has, the band was relaxed, the audience was 100% into the show, and everyone was there to have fun and celebrate a band that has probably meant a lot to them from the beginning. 

I can't believe I almost didn't go. Seeing them live reminded me how much this band meant to me and how much I love them. THANK YOU (x10000000000 billion) Cabatan, that was the best Birthday present a girl could ask for. And thanks Jenn for dancing up a storm with me, I think we definitely did this much better the second time around.

So thats that I guess, well if I'm never going to see a band again I'm glad I saw them play the show they did last night.

"event","Lets give a round of applause to the weekend folks b/c lets face it, it fucking slayed. 
First of all I got to see Amanda who I love and have missed quite a bit since she moves out two weeks ago. Second I went on a road trip and lets face it I love road trips, especially when they involve killer road trip mix CDs as this one did.
So it all started early Saturday morning when Amanda, Matt, Jon and I made our way out of the city to Jon's house in Omeeme. We dropped the boys off and Amanda and I went to spend a lovely afternoon in Lindsay on an absolutely glorious day. After a brief trip to the dollar stores for birthday supplies aka a sash, some crowns, streamers and sparklers, we got lunch, watched a dance recital in the park and ended up lounging on a sleeping bag in the sun while listening to music from Amanda's car.
This whole time we were supposed to be avoiding being bored in Fenlon while the boys practiced, but they called us and told us they hadn't even left for Fenlon yet so do we want to tag along anyways so we did. 
*insert loud music and TV with a sprinkle of Brad and Crosley* That pretty much sums up Fenlon. 
Later was Jen's Birthday show back in the park in Lindsay. Then it started to drizzle which sucked b/c we were supposed to be camping out in Jen's field later that night, and it kept drizzling through but the Springloaded and Vile set, both of which were a lot of fun and full of dancing. I wish I hadn't been so cold for the last band A Dying Race b/c I probably would have enjoyed them more. 
After the show we packed everything up and Jen decided we should party at Ted's instead of in a field since it was now raining pretty hard. The party was fun and drunk-like, we danced to the strokes, made sandwiches, talked, sang, and good times were had by all.
Eventually we went Dan's place where we sat in the hot tub drinking beers until the sun came up.
The next day consisted of a tour of the lakes of Burnt River and Coboconk from Dan's dad, a BBQ with Dan's family, pizza, movies, and sleeping. That night we met up with the ""fenlon"" crowed and had a bonfire down near the river, where we crashed lisa's sisters party aka we ate their food and laughed at their horrible country music. It was a fun and mellow night with surprisingly only one bag of pee thrown by Brad at Rob.
The nest day Dan and I picked up Brad and Crosley and Dan drove us all back to TO.
So to recap mixCDs+parks+shows+birthdays+drinking+dancing+hottub+fire+drivehome = the perfect long weekend."

Then the fuckers ate all my bread.

It was a perfect way to end a pretty mellow weekend. If only friday night had ended better, then again who doesn't want to be storming around in their underwear and a sweater more pissed off than they have been in a long time b/c they are tired of not being respected by selfish people at 4 am. Ya good times. I think I actually scared some people, haven't been that mad in a long time. Felt kind of good. Sorry to anyone I woke up aka Amanda, and sorry to anyone who was high that I freaked out b/c they thought I was running around naked aka Matt. Ya interesting night, and here all I wanted was to watch a movie, hang out and go to bed.

Saturday I was tired from my Friday night excapades and hid from the world b/c slush isn't meant to fall from the sky and I was worried the world was coming to an end. Some of the Fort made some pretty killer movies though. All murder mysteries shoudl have vikings and end with halloween costumes, jigs, and guy on guy head. I hear Jesus also confronted a T-rex after I went to bed, glad they caught this all on film. 

Yesterday I worked.

This is my last week of classes and I am super psyched. Drinking with the girls wednesday, drinking b/c I'll be done classes Thursday, Weakerthans Friday, and a house party saturday, sounds like a good way to celebrate to me."

"event","It was a crazy weekend (see subject). I am currently obsessed with the song Add it Up by the Violent Femmes, it makes me want to dance like a fool, wait thats how I always dance...

Friday was awesome, good show, good people getting older, good company, good dancing...well I don't remember much after that lol

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TY AND JON! I love you both. You are both older than me and therefore wiser, so you are my role models and I look up to you (I'm so screwed...). So here is a toast to two people very close to me and who I couldn't live without. *hugs and kisses*

Sat was fun too, didn't get in to see the Black Halos b/c we weren't drunk or slutty enough. Brads right I shoudl have shown my cans. Damn oh well soon I wont be denying bouncers blow jobs any longer. We ended up at the Q bar and saw a crazy awesome hardcore show. Brad and Matt moshed, Langford and I bobbed out heads, good times. I also got my piercing changed and its now smaller and even though i didn't think it was possible its hotter. Hung out at Exotics for a while with the guys and girl who work there. They are so nice and way to much fun, I really hope Shane comes out drinking with us. Melissa wants me to get a tattoo of bubbles on my lower back (or stars they seemed to think I was a star person, they are probably right) but as I told Shane, when he asked what he could do for me that day, ""you are not coming near me with your tattoo gun"" and for now I'm sticking to it.

Today Dan and I went out and looked at expensive frames, but nothing caught my eye. They were all a little too flashy and I'm just not trendy enough for what they had to offer. Hopefully my optometrist will have something on Tuesday b/c I want new frames. I feel its time for a change. We continued to enjoy the nice weather and looked at indie movies and yuppy furnature. It was a nice afternoon. This evening consisted of the Simpsons and Mr. Show.

Now the weekend it over and that smells, at least I have nothing due or tests to write this week, and I am intrigued to see what next weekend will bring."

"event","to the Arcade Fire Show April 27th. If I don't I will die. So who wants to come with me? Matt K I'm looking at you. Anyways the fact that they are playing Toronto when I am currently obsessed with them is just brilliant timing on their part and I thank them.

In other news, I have one more midterm this week. Today's went okay but not as well as the one before reading week. Tomorrow's is going to suck. Oh well. 

It was nice to see Jenn, Alison and Amanda again on Tuesday though it was only for a short time. I really hope they all come out Friday night. That would rule.

Three weeks until I can suck cock again. 

Man do I not want to study right now."

"event","had a crazy car adventure last night... i was giving a friend a ride home from a walmart party (we almost took over the electronics section with toilet plungers, but the guy at the desk had a laser gun, bah) at like 11, and we were cruising down a back country road when, BAM, i couldn't see anything.  evidently we had hit a bump or something, that popped the hood open.  at 45-50 mph,  that big sheet of metal is not very aerodynamic... big ol' sail catches the wind and sends it straight up into the windsheild.  BAM.  CRACK.  windshield all busted up, rearview mirror lying by the pedals.  i stopped (smart), while looking through the crack under the hood so we didn't go into the ditch (smart), and then got out to put the hood back down (smart) taking the keys with me (not smart).  so i get the hood down, though it's like bent in half, and turn around to see headlights approaching from behind.  that's when i realize that the car is off, so we're basically a big dark blob on an empty country road about to get rear ended at 50 mph.  first thought is to get the car on so he sees the lights, but keys are in my pocket and it'll take at least 15 seconds to find the right one, probably longer cus my mind is not in top condition at this point.  so i go charging behind the car and start doing jumping jacks.  it was carolyn who had the presence of mind to TURN ON THE EMERGENCY FLASHERS.  yes, i'm an idiot.  man, that guy's brakes squealed.
as it happened, we were almost to civilization, and there was a residential street about a hundred yards ahead.  i drove up there all slowlike, and got out of the way of crazy night time country road traffic.  carolyn had a cell phone, so we let parents know where we were (though BOTH of our dads drove right by us the first time).  and then just hung out for like half an hour waiting for more functional cars to come get us.  exciting."

"event","graduation is a lucrative business.  should do it more often.  my liquid assests have been boosted over $300 in the past two days, not to mention the video camera my parents gave me... it's a tight little sony handicam... my baby...

since i was salutatorian, i had to do a speech at the bacalauriate (sp?) mass on tuesday... meh... people liked it though, so it's all good.  mr. sands, my calculus teacher and officially the smartest man on the face of the planet, even requested a copy to keep... he was an awesome calc teacher, cus we spent more time in class discussing philosophy and life in general than we did calc... i have no idea why he's working at a little place like stm...
oh, yeah, and i got a pile of random awards, including a plaque certifying that i know more about catholicism than like 95% of catholics... lol... the theology department award went to a non-catholic too... though, that's probably because she was the only one who never did anything to piss off father joe... the only one in the whole senior class...

a pile of my junior (or, rising senior now, i guess) friends left today for their class pilgrimage to rome.  it was pretty funny, cus all their shirts said ""catholic trips"" on them, but the ""t"" is like an ornate cross, so they really say ""catholic rips""...  we'll see what benedict xi has to say about that diss on his religion... well, i thought it was pretty funny...
anyway, they'll be gone all week.  chester didn't go, so i can use the time to learn some 1337 |-|4><o0|2 5|<|115 from him...  summer has arrived... good luck with finals, hanover people."

south pacific is over.  everyone liked it, it was fun, and we all did a pretty good job.  really going to miss it.

15 school days left for me.  counting down.

just got back from the hitchhiker's guide movie... it was way better than i thought it was going to be... i've only read bad reviews.  while much of it wouldn't make any sense to someone who hasn't read the book, i have.  of the new stuff, the ultimate use of the pov gun was definately the best... totally saw it coming, but it was awesome.

this afternoon my sister (who came down to see me in south pacific) and i went to see les miz, which came to town on tour.  i had forgotten so much about that show... the guy playing valjean was so totally full of himself it wasn't even funny, but other than that it was awesome.  pulled up a lot of memories.

well, i've been getting zero sleep this week what with rehearsal late every night and confused emotions all day... so i'm going to go in the corner and pass out.  cheers. :)"

"event","ahhh... april fools day.... soooo much fun....  yesterday was preparation- chester, carolyn and i took a little trip to a store called ""dallas,"" which has costumes, magic, theater stuff, etc, to pick up a few necessities: some large plastic cockroaches, some blood packets, a pair of sunglasses with holographic eyeballs on the lenses, and a plastic monkey mask.

today, carolyn loaded the girls bathrooms with the roaches (unfortunately, i was unable to observe reactions, though when joe showed one to betsy in the hallway, there was a nice screech.)

in chem i tried a trick i had read on a prank site, a supposed method of shorting out part of the school's power:  plug something in halfway, and drop a quarter on the exposed prongs.  unfortunately, it didn't short the power, but it did pop the quarter, making some cool sparks....

just before lunch, i got out of theology, recruted korbin (who happened to be out of class as well) to make sure that the administration's attention was diverted, and took the glasses and mask into the main hall... see, right in front of the office is a bust of our school's namesake, st. thomas more, who was about to get a little... plastic surgery.  the bell went, and everyone in first lunch (half the school) walked past the sage ape on the way to lunch...  got some laughs...  unfortunately, there wasn't a good way of securing the mask and glasses with out causing damage, so the monkey mask and googly eyes are now in the possession of the establishment...

mr sands wasn't there for math, and we were really bored, so elena and i made ""out of order"" signs for the bathrooms.  kind of lame, but boredom is the best excuse...

the prank that was a sort of afterthought originally turned out to be the most successful... i even fooled a couple people who i had told before....  so proud of myself... in track, we were doing an excercise were everyone pairs off, and we run in two lines, around the parking lot.  the two people in front then race around in the opposite direction from everyone else, and the winner gets to sit out for a lap.  then the next two in line race, etc.  i waited until i was in the back, and pulled out one of the blood packs and emptied the thing on my head.  eventually, someone was like ""whoa, tom, you're bleeding!""  i was of course surprised.  (huh, how did i suddenly start gushing blood from my head...) by this time it had trickled all the way down my neck... joe and carolyn immediately caught on, but no one else did.... coach sent me inside to get washed up, hoping, i guess, that the bleeding was done.  after washing off the majority of the goop, i went back out and rejoined the team... throwing in a few hints of dizzyness here and there... finally, after i won a lap off, and the line was coming back around, i sort of stumbled up to join it, hand on my head.  coach said maybe i should go inside, i said (no, i'm ok *stagger* i can finish up the workout...) then she started freaking, like ""no, you've got to go inside... let me see your head"" (no, i'm ok, let me run) ""no, you're not ok, holy crap your hair's full of blood"" i'm trying to cover it up with my hand, but i'm so ""dizzy"" at this point that i'm about falling over (i don't need to go inside...) ""yes, you do, now!"" (... i just need some shampoo, cus this fake blood stains really badly) ""what... fake...?"" then i really did have to run, cus she was about ready to bite my head off... hehehehe.... she was soooo scared... chester didn't catch on, even though he was with me yesterday when i bought the stuff...  made my day."

i was bored.  nuff said.  kind of disappointed i didn't score higher... 20% of the population is nerdier than i am... should go and memorize the periodic table or something...

so i found out today that i'm going to prom.  wasn't planning to, but made a bet with carolyn that if she could beat me at the game ""lightsabers"" (where your lock hands and try to stab eachother with your index finger), then i would go.  however, this was on the condition that we played left handed (she's a lefty, i'm not, evens the field a little).  SOMEHOW SHE WON.  i was pulling this cool spinny move, intended to put her off balance, but she grazed my arm on the way around.  so i'm going to prom.  don't know what i'm going to do.  can't dance.  just sort of stand around, i guess.

looking forward to tomorrow... lots of kids from our school are going on a field trip to chicago for art class, which means that a lot of people will be missing from classes, which means a lot of study halls.  for you spoiled hanover people, that basically means ""scheduled up.""  except at my school, it's a good thing.  yeah.  chill out all day."

"event","today was the opposite of my last entry... started out majorly bad, ended up pretty good.  i've been tired all week, as have most of my friends, and carolyn has been uncharacteristically depressed.  i've been at a loss to figure out what's up, and as a result have been growing the feeling of utter helplessness all week long.  in gym i was so frustrated that i punched the wall and lost all feeling in my hand for about ten minutes.  then we had a study hall in advanced morality, and i decided to vent in writing, and cranked out a reasonalby intense poem about how i don't know how to help her if she won't tell me what's wrong... it felt good to get that out... then i stuck a copy in her locker.  not the best thoght out course of action, but i didn't know what else i could do.  in track after school, she was back to normal.  she said the poem made her cry, but then she felt better.  i guess that's all she needed.  glad she's back.

joe and i are planning another movie.  it's going to be like four story lines that start together and then diverge... played backwards like in mommento.  the four stories are going to be about: two college guys who had offered to make dinner for their girlfriends, however realize that they are out of ketchup, and start raiding the neighborhood to get some; a kangaroo salesman (either looking for a new job, or selling roos on the black market); some really dumb terrorists; and a dude who finds a magic cabbage which brings him very bad luck.  no idea how they're going to relate yet, we're working on it."

also had the regional math comp on saturday.  jaemin and i got first place in the jr/sr two person team, and third in the oral presentation, and i got a sort of fourth place in the individual pre-calc tests.  overall our school got second out of eight.  pretty cool."

"event","watched the superbowl.  was not all that excited.  nothing is going to beat the superbowl a few years back (was it the broncos?) that came down to a winning touchdown with :01 on the clock, being made RIGHT ON THE LINE.  and no ad will ever beat the eds cat herders or running of the squirrels (though this year, the bud skydiving one was pretty funny, and the ameriquest spaghetti/cat one was awesome)  if you missed the ads, they can all be found at http://dyn.ifilm.com/superbowlads/
somewhat disappointing.  though the patriots did win.  again.  but it was too much effort to make myself care about a football game this year.

the first weekend of ""a little princess"" is over.  thankfully... it's a play for newbies to CDW, a means to get more people involved.  lots of little kids.  the people who have done plays there before almost all have cameo roles, which is pretty cool as that means that we all just hang out backstage the whole time.  the actress who i had to work off of in my two scenes this weekend was only in the first weekend shows, and thankfully the girl who's going to be playing the part next weekend seems to know what she's doing... though she hasn't been to hardly any rehearsals.  yeah.  we'll see.  can't be any worse than the first weekend... we ended up skipping half of the first scene, and there was one place in the second scene that i had to cover for her ALL THREE SHOWS.

got some modeling done for one sequence in this movie chester, carolyn, and i are making.  the two of them are talking, making a deal which will result in the complete overthrow of the governement, and they're caught on security camera.  their faces are scanned in wireframe, which a computer then uses to pull up all sorts of info about them, so agents can be sent to take them out.  i could only find good profile shots to work off of, building the faces, which means that from the side they look exacttly like chester and carolyn (close), but from any other angle, there is no resemblance whatsoever.  need to work on that.  probably get some good reference pictures simply for that purpose.

time for physics homework.  yay."

"event","had my eagle scout court of honor last night.  i had to stand there while my parents and scout leaders made speeches about what a great guy i am.  it was really long to stand.  my mom read excerpts from a bunch of letters from various senators, reps, both george bushes, etc... some even mentioned things specific to me, but it was probably mostly a lot of form letters.. but i also got letters from my two favorite columnists, dave barry and john leo.  WHOA... ok, so i'm starstruck, sue me... no form letters there...

got first semester report card today... my faith and reason grade was the only one to get worse second quarter, and not much surprise there... i'll just have to be sure to be perfect on all of the graded work in advanced morality, so fr. joe has no excuse to drop my grade this semester... also see if i can get my english b up to an a this semester... we'll see... otherwise, good stuff..."

"event","yeah... my theology class this semester could be awesome, could suck.  it all depends on whether fr. joe will let us discuss, or if he'll just tell us the stance of the catholic church, and when we ask ""why"" answer ""because.  discussion over.""  yesterday he go treally mad at me because i brought up an old issue... see, at my school, we've got a requirement to log the time we spend doing volunteer work, which i object to on the grounds that it changes the purpose of the work:  volunteer work should be voluntary, right?  well, yesterday fr. joe brought up the relationship between actions and intentions in determining the morality of different situations- i made the obvious connection, and he started yelling at me about how i'm always so difficult and closed minded... given that he got mad about a question, that last accusation is rather amusing, and given that most of the time i'm ""closed minded"" by asking him questions which he cannot answer (ok, so i don't simply take his word for anything, i always have to know why... if that's closed minded, i'm guilty as charged)... anyway, today, we got into a spontanious discussion about the basis of morality, about whether ""good"" and ""evil"" can be defined apart from God... and fr. joe got pissed off again, because that wasn't in his lesson plan for the day.  or something like that.  evidently we were all mistaken, morality is based on what the catholic church says, and all we need to do is listen to fr. joe's decrees, and not question.  ok, maybe i'm not being fair to the guy, the situation is a bit exagerated... but hey, if there was one class which was DESIGNED for discussion, this would be it...

yeah, got back english final, and physics.  did better than i thought on english (a 6 on the AP scale of 1-9, which is about a B) and went over the top on physics.  unfortunately, not everyone did as well (our class average was a failing grade), but with a little lawyer work, we managed to  get every grade in the class raised by 10 percent points!  that was because he took off a lot of points he shouldn't have... like points off for putting an answer in cm when he SPECIFICALLY asked for METRIC UNITS (luckily, mrs. johnson, my chem teacher, was there to vouch for cm's status as metric.  mr. catarello gets a little confused sometimes)

ok, just so i don't leave everyone with the impression that all my teachers are idiots... math class was awesome.  mr. sands gave us the theology class that we all wish we could have had... we did no calculus, but we learned a lot about the issue of free will, and the origin of evil... which i know something about, given the week long spontaneous discussion at camp last summer, but mr. sand's take was interesting.  good fun.

"event","we've got some snow.  nothing that any good new englander would consider significant, but it's the most we've had all winter: about three inches of powder.  enough to have to shovel, but not enough to really do anything cool with.  oh, well.

went skating today- a friend's birthday party was at a skating rink (reminded me of amanda's b-day, at the roller rink... good times).  only a tiny fraction of the people invited actually showed up, which meant that the pizza/candy/soda was in abundant quantities for all involved.  goodie.

i've got an english paper to write over the weekend, some sort of character analysis (i think i'm going to do sydney carton from tale of two cities) however, i don't have the sheet with specific info on what it's about... or how long it has to be... my guess is, five or six pages, but i need to find this out....

the fire is now in joe's movie.  i'd post it here, but i have no method of uploading movies.  : (  it looks pretty cool.  he's got a guranteed A+

the most recent issue of discover had a cover article on a computer simulation called ""avida"" which is essentially natural selection in a digital world, with ""organisms"" evolving number processing skills... apparently, it's on the web for download.  sweet!  unfortunately, i am currently unable to compile it... still working on that.  it looks cool, though.  while that front, i am yet unsuccessful, my search did turn up a really interesting forum at www.iscid.org.  the acronym stands for ""international society for complexity, information, and design.""  it's a must see for anyone at all interested in the intelligent design movement, or those who operate under the popular misconception that the only people who do not accept neodarwinian evolution are uneducated redstate hicks.  some very interesting articles/discussions there.

hmmm.... maybe should start on that english paper...."

"event","yeah, it's been a long time since i last posted... haven't really  been on for a while. busy w/ school and the like.  brief perusal of recent entries... nothing ground breakingly amazing going on... i haven't missed anything important, have i?  so much of what is happening here has so little to do with those of you who actually read this post, that it's almost pointless to put anything up anymore.  very sad.  i want to take another trip out there, visit you hanover people.

we're starting a film club at stm.  though, it's going to be less a ""film club"" than a ""secret society for nerds with a cinematic flair.""  only certain people are going to  be allowed in, so we will not be overrun by bums who just want to make skateboard movies or something.  it will be interesting to see how this plays out.

this next weekend is our homecoming dance, which i am actually going to go to this year *shock* no, not kidding.  and i'm not going alone either, i asked katie.  no, this does not mean i am reworking my philosophy of dating, (katie shares my views on the subject, so there's no danger of miscommunication).

yesterday my family was in chicago, helping my sister move into her dorm.  there were elevators, but the lines for them were very long, so i carried some of the stuff up the old fasioned way, by stairs.  did i mention that my sister's room is on the 12th floor?  good workout, she can forget about the freshman 15.
yeah, that's about it here.  drop me an e-mail, if you have time."

"event","so, summer is over for me.  STM started up on thursday, with a nice quick half day.  i've got some cool teachers, though mr fink is no longer there (he's leaving for kuwait in about a week).  most classes are starting out slowly, but AP english is not among those.  today, we spent the entire period writing from a prompt.  we could write abbout any of the four books we had for summer reading, and a lot of people chose frankenstein (the question had to do with social standards and their effects on a character).  i wrote mine on the awakening, simply because it's so much fun to rant about it.

had an excellent start to the year in social studies today.  i have the same teacher i did last year, which means we're going to be doing a lot of chilling in that class.  in one chill moment when everyone was chatting, i was talking with a girl named kimberly about pirates of the caribbean.  she wanted to know if there was any ""bad stuff"" she should be warned about before watching it. i told her that there was a whole lot less violence than one would expect, the only real gore were the living skeletons, and there was no nudity.  now, right about that moment, it so happened that everyone else in the room happened to come to a lull in the conversation.  it wasn't speaking very loudly, but that one key word rang out across the silence with amazing clarity.  everyone, including the teacher, just turned and stared at us, like ""what are you guys TALKING about?""  it was pretty funny.

unfortunately, after freshman pe with rock climbing, sophomore year pe free, and two slacker classes last year, i'm going to have to take a real gym class.  crap.  well, it's not so bad, i've got some friends in the class (dex, vaughn, katie, etc) so it should be ok.

i've got two science classes, first and second period.  they're in the same room.  pretty cool.  carolyn and rosemary are both in those two classes as well.
thankfully, homework has not taken off yet.  i only have a few problems to do for calculus, and a chapter to read for faith and reason, and a pile of papers for my parents to sign.  still chill time."

"event","boys' state was a lot cooler than i thought it would be.  to give a very quick summary of the week, i was elected county sheriff for stelle county, and represented my city (mather) at the county meetings as a supervisor.  i ran for governor, but there was one kid who was fated to win that, because of his voice. (high and squeaky, everyone thought it was soooo funny.  well, he did have an ok speech, but i doubt most people were actually listening to what he was saying) 
i was involved in the initiation of a prank war with another county (savage), but my friends and i decided that political scheming was more important than stealing shower curtains.  overall, it was really cool.  you can check out pictures from it at www.illiniosboysstate.org and i'm in a few of them. (i'm famous!!!!! yeah, anyways...)
made a bunch of friends:
mike noonan - drummer/ bass guitar player, formerly of a band called ""the skank bangers.""  my campaign manager, proud to be a socialist, and probably my best friend there.
wes - city and county treasurer, guardian of the pizza fund.  a rabid sports fan, especially the cubs.
mike ""maglite"" martin - in our rather unplanned shower curtain raid on savage, he was the only member of the team without the presence of mind to just walk away when confronted with all 80 members of that county, caught in the act.  he tried running, but got caught, and in panic drew his trusty maglite, laying about with it.  that little episode got all of us in trouble, and we called him ""maglite"" for the rest of the week.
brian - pretty quiet kid, but odd in a funny way.  the last night there, we wanted to duct tape someone to a chair, and he volunteered.  we left him out on the landing with a sign taped to his chest that said ""savage.""  the next thing we knew, he had broken half way out, and was waddleing across the lobby.
morgan - the only one of the crew not from mathers city, though we inducted him at the end of the week.  he joined up because his city was a center for an impromptu political party called the ""badass.""  they disliked him, and he joined our ""party,"" i3.  however, given a short, not quite overheard, transaction between him and one of the badass leaders, i'm not sure if he may have been a spy.  he was cool anyway.
steven ""skull"" kull - a funny, kind of dorky kid.  he ran for secretary of state, lost the primary, but kept on handing out his little business cards.
curt - our city's cool counciler, and last year's governor.  he was very cool about blocking his ""counciler ears"" whenever we started talking about raids on savage, or any number of rather unapproved subjects.
that's just to name a few.  it was awesome.
we made up a really cool game called ""extreme frizbee.""  it can only be played in a narrow dorm hallway, with on of those cloth and wire discs that won't leave marks on the wall.  it can be played with teams of one or two.  essentially, the two teams face eachother about twenty feet apart, and chuck the frizbee at eachother.  if a team drops the frizbee, the other team gets a point.  it's especially amusing if it is played at 3 in the morrning, when your mind is legally shut off, and you act drunk without needed to  actually consume anything.  that pesky disc is so freaken hard to get when you're having trouble standing up straight.  good fun.

so yeah, back for another week.  on wednsday i'm leaving for camp spofford (in nh), and after july 2 or 3 i'll be staying with a friend who lives in plainfield, for a week.  let me know when you guys are avaliable for chillin' time during then, so we can, well, chill."

"event","well, that was interesting.
so i'm just sitting here at the computer, minding my own business, converting the mafia script to industry standards, listening to rebecca st. james, when i hear a kind of *crunch*.  i got a mental image of my little brother climbing up a bookcase, and knocking a couple books off.  this all happens in the split second before there a drawnout, multi-wave explosion from the same direction.  my mental picture changes to  the bookcase falling on my brother.  not good.  i jump up, and run out of the room- into a dust cloud.  the floor is covered with chunks of inch thick plaster debris and dust, much of the latter deciding that it aspired to higher things than the floor, and exploring my nose.  then i look up, and see the square yard of rough wood on the ceiling, wood which up to about five seconds ago had been covered by the plaster which now covered the floor.  the sound was multi-leveled, because there evidently were a few stages of destruction involved- the *crunch* was that of the plaster coming loose from the ceiling, and starting its descent.  the first stage of secondary noise came from the square yard of falling plaster encountering the banister of our stairs, effectively cutting it in two pieces.  the second stage was the larger chunk hitting the second story hallway floor, and being blasted into dust and shrapnel.  the third stage was the second piece of the original chunk being pulverized two stories below in our front hallway.  the fourth and smallest stage would have been the chunks of the second floor piece which where sent through the railing, to follow the first floor chunk the rest of the way down.

it seems there had been a crack in the ceiling for a while, and my mom had called a contractor we know about it, ironically enough, just this morning.

it's just too bad i hadn't know this was going to happen ten or fifteen seconds eariler, so i could have had the camera on it when it went.  ahh, weeelll.
it's all cleaned up now.  and i need to  go wash my hands, i'm getting my keyboard dirty."

"event","i finally went out to the sword fighting group today.  i hadn't gone before because they don't allow me to use my own arsinal- and the sword they use are EXPENSIVE.  check them out here: http://www.edhellen.com/
anyway, the let people borrow weapons for free, so i was out there with a short little sword and shield- getting shashed into tiny pieces.  that's right, the ""black knight"" of rrc fame was being smashed.  it was quite nice to be the underdog, and therefore have room to improve.  by the end of the time (around three hours) i had managed to kill two people honorably, backstab a couple more (this group does not regard backstabbing as dishonorable), releive a few people of limbs, and actually survive a few battles.  there were about 30 people there, so the team battles were awesome.  however, it was hard adjusting to the new rules (no headshots, no stabbing, etc) and the fact that this was by NO conceivable means a ""lightest touch"" group (my elbow still hurts).  oh, and since you can't hop around when you lose a leg, my knees hurt too.
i'm going back whenever i can.  it's pretty sweet."

"event","i'm in shock.  it is amazing.
it started yesterday, when my friend anastasia called up and wanted to know if i could come to a party at her house- that evening.  well, given my mom's past  track record as regards parties (with  the exception of the LAN party last friday, but that might really be the start of this story) i figured i didn't even need to bother asking, a) it was a party and b) it was that day.  my mom loves planning ahead.  but i asked anyway.  she said yes.  she even gave me a ride there and back.  wow.
now today- it was katie's birthday yesterday, which she spent in chicago.  however, i just got a call from rosemary, about a party they were putting together- this afternoon.  in one hour from when i'm writing this, in fact.  the plan is, katie, rosemary, carolyn, joe, and i go to lunch at 2:30, chill there for a while, then go see ""van helsing"" at 4.  a) no planning ahead, b) no direct parental supervision, c) van helsing is pg-13.  all strikes against it in my mom's book.  but when i asked her, she said yes.  all she wanted was for me to write down the name of the place we're going to be eating(she's out right now, this was on her cell phone), and give her an estimate of when i would be getting back.
so that's pretty cool.  too bad this mood never hit her in nh (well, there was amanda's party.  that was cool)
good fun."

"event","schools out..........YAHOOOOOOOOOOO! two finals yesterday, pre-calc and vocations.  i forgot how to figure out a geometric sequence on the pre-calc final, but other than that it was cool.  the vocations test was amazingly, i would say insultingly but it was about what i expected from mrs. hakl, easy- i got both the three pages of true/false, and the essay done in a total of about twenty minutes.  and we weren't allowed to leave.  luckily i had me ipod and a book, so i survived.  then it was all over.

on my way to school, chester told me about a lan party going on at some kid's house after school, which he was going to until 11.  on a cell phone, i called up my mom, asked her if i could go, and amazingly she said yes.  my guess is it had a lot to do with the fact that she didn't actually have to drive me anywhere.
so i spent a happy afternoon filled with random, senseless killing.  i mostly played halo, though i did try my hand at ut04 and red facttion, sucking at both.  though, the fact that i didn't do well in ut04 probably has more to do wit h the fact that someone was hacking into our server and screwing up the game, than an extreme lack  of skill on my part- though, of course, there was that element too.
the kid also had a huge trampoline, pool, and a nice yard.  we played football, ultimate frisbee, and when it got dark we played hide and seek.  since i always dress in camo colors, i did pretty well at that.

so, for me summer is here.  time to make some movies."

As a professional humorist, I often get letters from readers who are interested in the basic nature of humor, but few fortified mills are actually known: one in Beurge, and another recently discovered near Montauban, in the next valley.  However, by an exraordinarily lucky chance, they had not yet fully corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and they passed right under it.  The raising of Lazarous differs from the Resurrection of Christ Himself because Lazarus, so far as we know, was not raised to a new and more glorious mode of existence, but merely restored to the sort of life he had before.  Speaking of raising,  Freud does not raise any question of systematic phenomenology, and it is here that structural analysis can usefully fill a gap in psychological theory, just as transactional analysis fills a gap in social theory by setting up elementary units (transactions) and larger units (games and scripts) of social action.

yeah, so i went for a fairly diverse selection of literature there.  needed a little adjustment to fit better.

finals tomorrow.  thursday will be easy, since the only one i need to take then is english- my sociology and gym classes don't have finals, since they were mainly composed of seniors.  however, tomorrow i have spanish (need to review vocab, but should be easy), then chemisty (open book- though i won't be surprised if mr. yockey throws some curve balls...), and drama (which again, should be easy, since we spent most of fourth quarter doing nothing)
friday i have math and vocations, neither of which should be too bad.
what? me study?  ok, maybe a little...

chemistry was fun today.  mr. yockey let us play with the bunsen burners, even let tunes, matt and chris set a desk on fire (ok, so it was just burning ethanol poured on the desk, but it still looked cool)  nick, dexter and i were ""chefs,"" cooking pennies to insane temperatures on the bunsen burner, then dropping them in cold water.  pennies made before 1984 (i think that's where the line is) would look fine, if a little burnt, until we dropped them in the water, when they would shed an outer layer of copper.  this accomplished both cleaning them nicely (the dirt and grime came off with the copper) and also to make the inscriptions quite unreadable.  the newer pennies were much more fun.  since the inside of those is just zinc, they melt much faster.  when we put some of those on to cook, we were actually able to wrap the penny around a paper clip-- then drop it in the water to harden.  then  we messed one up, and ended up squiching it through the wire mesh we had over the burner.  so now we have beads of zinc.  it was pretty cool.
also got to play with a generator- dexter cranked on end as i touched two points on another, and i got the sensation of putting my fingers against a rapidly rotating wheel's spokes.  good fun.

filming yesterday was pretty cool too.  matt decided to drive his car off road, across the park, in order to chase down joe.  we got it on film.
then i tried driving matt's car.... fun.  it's a '52 chevy, falling apart.  it takes serious muscle to shift gears, and it has four speeds: too fast for comfort or control, faster than that, so fast that i didn't even try that on residential streets, and reverse.  reverse is pretty fast too.  anyway, mattt was giving me directions, and one turn came a little late- in my dad's outback, it would have been easy, but in matt's car i almost took out a street sign.  we got that on tape too.  then driving back around, also on tape, we have carolyn screaming in terror as i confront a busy intersection in the old beast.  very good fun.  btw, no one was injured, but it was quite exciting.  from now on, i will stick to cars overwhich i have some control.  well, maybe not, it WAS pretty fun...

got my track awards, even though i didn't really expect any.  the ceremony was sunday, but i was going to lunch at some people's house , and couldn't make it.  got two ribbons for two fifth places in the 4x4 and 4x8- and a very nice medal for a thrid place in 4x4.  i also got the coach's award, basically for showing up to practice everyday.  as coach said at the ceremony, ""he came to every practice, never missed an event.  except one.  he's not here now.""  i've gotten more trophies and such this year than the rest of my life combined.  and in that i am not including the random trophies we all got in pre-minor league softball.  i have two trophies, three medals, three ribbons, a plaque, and an oscar- against the one legitimate trophy i got in baseball for happening to  be on the champion team.  i am happy.

ROTK CAME OUT ON VIDEO TODAY!  WOHOOOO! this weekend.... renting, of course.  waiting for the extended to buy it..."

"event","track is finally done.  whew.  sectionals went ok, i had a little scare when i finished third in my heat(running the 800).  however, that was evidently tthe reeeeaaaaly slow heat, and in the last one, the slowest guy beat my time by about 10 seconds. so i am officially done.

had some fun riding my bike back from filming/habitat for humaity store orientation this morning.  i normally ride my bike on the side walk, so i'm the biggest fish in the pond-- but there was some road work, and the sidewalk was blocked off up ahead.  so i turned onto the road, which was half blocked off (rt lane)  which meant i needed t o be riding practically on top of the cars.  not good.  then i saw that there were two lines of cones, with a sort of lane between them.  i figured, that was either a nice, safe, bike path; or an open sewer.  by the time i was able to see that it was the former, it was too late.  i was turning in, but ended up plowing into one of the cones at about 20 mph.  this wasn't one of those wimpy traffic cones that you can squish, this was one of the big barrel cones.  anyway, i managed t ojump over the handle bars safely, as my bike slammed the cone about 8 ft across the ground.  my sister, who was riding behind me, said it looked pretty cool.  the only damage done  to the bike was the chain coming off the gears, but i got that back on ok.  the cone still has a massive dent in the side, though.
the best part was this all happened because i was trying to be safe.

for those of you who i haven't told yet,  there's a chance i can come up to visit in early july, for maybe a week.  still working on that, more info later."

"event","after tomorrow, i will be able to count the school days left on one hand.  and given that im not having finals in two of my classes, this is shaping up to be a pretty easy week.

today, seniors were hangingg around the school for some reason, even though none of them had classes.  lucky for me.  i have two classes which are just about all seniors, so i got two periods chilling in the library.  now, you spoiled hhs, x-period, open campus, in-class-eatting, non-dress code people out there may be thinking ""crap! two periods in the library?  why's he happy aboutt being scheduled up?"" but given that one of my senior friends was writing an english final in there, had brought his laptop with a dvd player, and a full book of discs, including matrix reloaded, i was quite happy.  i'm going to see if i can get anyone else to bring in laptops and matrix revolutions sometime in the next week, i can watch that too.

as for track, sectionals are on friday.  wish me luck.  i'll need it.  i am seated dead last in my event, the 800.  this is going to suck, majorly, if i don't beat anyone at all.  ah, well, at least it means i won't have to go to state- mentally, i amd done with track for the year.

i had the most amazing night of poker with my small group tonight.  i started of the night with more full houses than i normally see in an entire night, and oculdn't seem to loose.  twice i was dealt terrible hands (non-suited 2 and 7, and non-suited 2 and 9-- we were playing texas hold-em) which i of course immediately folded.  both times, i would have ended up with three of a kind, the best hand  of anyone in those rounds.  it hurt to leave, i had won around $2,000 (not real money, unfortunately)

now i'm off to do the small amount of homework still trickling through at the end of school"

"event","we had the best english class ever today.  in response to something in ""invisible man"" (by ralph elison), mr. fink brought up the question of objective truth- whether or not it exists.  the discussion was so involved and good, that he followed us down to the class most of us have next (christian vocations) and we continued it through the next period as well.  
\the main points i got out of it and/or contributed were basically the destinction between ""perceived truth"" (which i refer to as ""fact"") and ""real Truth"" (or ""veritas"").  ""facts"" are all we can be sure of, but we must constantly re-evaluate our ""facts"" to bring them  as close to ""veritas"" as possible.  with all the different (and yet hauntingly similar) belief systems in the world, my guess is that none of them are completely wrong, or completely right.  some are much closer than others, but i don't think anyone has the perfect veritas nailed down.  
however, the most important point is, ___one must beleive that there is an absolute Truth, an absolute Right, to be beleived in if one is to ""beleive"" anything___.  when you say ""i beleive..."" you are simply stating your ""fact,"" but in order to have any meaning behind that, you must agree that there is something to be beleived in.  if there is no absolute, what does belief mean?  if no one can be right, no one can be wrong, the possiblility of discussion is completely destroyed.  if the meaning of everything is relative, then essentially, nothing has any meaning at all.
sorry if i'm not making sense- i'm still trying to organize 1 and a half hours of heated debate in my mind, a slow task.  if you want clarification, feel free to ask.  if you disagree, feel even freer (is that a word...?) to post, i love debate.  i see it as an opportunity to re-evaluate my ""fact"", and get closer to ""veritas""-- not just as a chance to shoot anyone down.  let me hear your ideas.

oh, and (you knew this was coming..) track is going cool.  we got a pizza party today, and coach says next week we're tapering off so we'll be fresh for sectionals.  now i just need to survive tomorrow..."

"event","wow.  we actually had a hard track practice today.  a mile, 800, 400, 300, 200, 4 one hundreds, and another 400.  i'll do the math for you: over 2.5 miles.  much of that sprinting.  this is the first time in a while my legs have gottten tired, normally my lungs give out and that's that.  but not today.

we're moving into super-get-filming-done mode in drama class- we got a total of 7 scenes shot over the weekend, and we're getting three more tonight.  which means i need to bike bac kout to doyle's house.  which isn't a short ride.  after that track practice.  yaaaaay.  oh, yeah, and after filming on saturday, we blew up carrolyn's house a few times, and are going to put it in the bloopers. good fun.

saturday gave me a bit of a revelation as well.  most of the scenes we did then only needed joe, carolyn (who are going out) and me in them, so we were chillin for most of the afternoon.  yeah, i had almost gotten myself to the point of being completely at peace with staying single until college, but seeing them with eachother made me amazingly lonely, a feeling i had all but left behind.  yeah, so i'm human.  it still hurts a bit, but i remind myself that i'm not alone, and that what doesn't kill me makes me stronger.  ok, so tthat sounds cold, but it's true.  suffering is never senseless, even though it may seem like it when you have to slog through.  life is always clearer from the high ground, looking back.

i've also been watching ""dune"" (time- 265 minutes.  this is not a one sitting movie).  it's pretty good, so far (i'm in the third episode of 3) though they do over do the matte paintings in the desert lanndscapes, an i really didn't remember that much sex in the book.  but overall, high quality.

so, yeah, track sectionals are coming up next week.  it remains to be seen if these practices will make me stronger, or the alternative."

"event","so we got the results of the math comp today, and we did better than i though.  our school placed 8th in the state in class 1A, i got 7th in the alge 2 test, and dj and i got 6th ffor orals (for which we each got a nifty looking trophy).  so that's all cool.

my english class was reminded today of an assignment we were given at the biginning of the year, due at the end- and assignment no one really did.  so we all have to run out and read three books from a list of 100 ""great books"" (meaning mostly long, and mostly boring) and write reviews for all of them in the three weeks of school we have left.  good fun.

i'm working on a replication off the beacon of minas morgul from rotk(in blender, bien sur))- i have some pics up on my site, but i'm still working on it.  looks pretty cool, though.

amazingly, we actually had a somewhat challenging track practice today (a nice, hard, 2.5 miles) and then i joined the girls track team in their game of tag.  good fun.

my dad and i watched gettysburg the other day, it's pretty good.  except for the small fact that they used the same shot sequence every single time a line of cannons went off, and in fact used the EXACT SAME SHOTS three or four times in a row.  overall, high qualitty.  the best part about that movie (and the book it's based on, killer angels) is that it doesn't take sides- while other civil war movies (like gone with the wind) present the story from either the northern or southern perspective only, you never really get the feeling of ""rooting for"" anyone in this movie.  both sides of the conflict are presented evenly, and in the end you feel bad for lee, longstreet, picket, etc, in their defeat, and are happy for chamberlain, buford, etc in their victory.(oops, did i give away the ending? my bad, it's not like we haven't known the ending for almost 150 years...)  also, the movie doesn't glorify the violence (like, say, lord of the rings with really cool sequences where legolas singlehandedly destroys a mumank and such).  it's filled with very interesting discussions (some of which can be compared to current issues).  good movie.  watch it.  though be warned, it's around 4 hours long."

"event","so the math comp went ok.  i got an 11 on individuals, which is a pretty good score (12 was enough to get me first in regionals) but i don't know how it measures up to state.  didn't do so great in orals- my watch was slow and i actually showed up late- poor dj was sweating bullets trying to get everything done alone.  not sure how the presentation was, dj was pretty nervous.  then in relays, we had one person on the team who probably eliminated any chance of winning(she was our first person for the first one, but i took over that for the second and third rounds).  kind of sad, that.

also, our planned filming for today won't get done, since a) it's raining, and b) my parents are gettting obnoxious about the question of driving.  i think some people are having a little trouble reading small print- such as ""drivers license.""  oh, weeeell."

"event","well that was fun.  i had signed up to work the concession stands at the softball game today, so had to cut that last entry short.  then found out that they don't sell concessions at softball games.  well.  and that AFTER my normal ride had left.  so i got to hang out, watch the softball team get butchered (unfortunately, as usual), and just got home.

so yeah, i took a couple of those quizzes (enemy of the christian church, american hating minority) and found something interesting-  they had me peggged as both an intellectual and a christian.  now, i don't disagree at all with those assesments, but that in their *cough* unbiased and *cough* scientific assesment, those two are mutually exclusive.... funny about that.  i'd be interested to know what ""obvious holes"" in the christian faith they are referring to- they seem to conviniently leave out that information (to avoid debate...?  or simply to hide their own ignorance...? who knows)
also the fact that they assume that i'm a liberal (well, anyone who can think is a liberal, right? *cough*)  easily reducing those stupid conservatives to whining animals with the sheer power of logic-- when i'm actually a moderate with conservative leanings.  funny about that...

so the meet today.
we ended up getting 2nd place out of 8 teams, which  was cool, but i had little to do with  that personally.  i did the same tso relays again, and managed to pass someone who started out about 50m ahead, their next guy whooped our  next guy, so it was all for naught.
given that those two events were first and last (again) i had loads of time to wait.  i did a lot of walking, and thinking, and kind of worked through some prroblems i've been dealing with, so that was good fun.

in otther news, we had the substitute teacher from the abyss in english and drama today.  our nickname for her is ""the lizard lady,"" since she looks like she fell asleep in a tanning booth.  her skin is literally red.  it's pretty freaky.  and she treatts us like kindergardeners ttoo.  basically, she's really obnoxious.  we ended up spending halff of drrama class trying to persuade her to let a group off us go down to the cafe to block out some scenes for the movie there- even  though mr. fink had left instructions for her to let drama class manage itself.
speaking of mr. fink, we found out yesterday thatt next fall he's being deployed to kuait, probably for about six months.  that sucks majorly, since he is the coolest teacher ever on the face of the earth.  yeah, that really sucks.

saw the beginning of the muppet movie last night, high qualitty sttuff that.  the second best part: ""i don't know how to thank you.""  ""i don't know why to thank you.""
and the best part: when miss piggy first sees kermit, the love song there was hilarious.  imagine a pig and a frog wearing shakespearian clothes, dancing in a meadow.  that's the first time in a while something has made me laugh so hard my stomach hurts.  good fun.

also saw a few good movies from theforce.net fanfilms section- ""brains and steel"" is a must if you like the princess bride; ""fanboys"" has a much better story and is much funnier than a lot of the stuff they have there, though it is about half an hour long; and the ratrix is pretty good too.

finally got a cleaning tape for the camera, but it turns out the footage itself is corrupted, so no lightsaber movies yet..."

1. Grab the nearest book.
2. Open the book to page 23.
3. Find the fifth sentence.
4. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.
(i asn't sure which was the fifth, since one sentence carried over from the last page, so here are two)
""Here is a third way of seeing it.  If the Moral Law was one of our instincts, we ought to be able to point to some one impulse inside us which was always what we call ""good,"" always in agreement with the rule of right behaviour.""

anyway.
just got back from our second track meet, the guys' team got fourth place out of six to eight teams, probably because most of our early stuff sucked.  in the 4x1, the baton was droped in the last handoff, when we probably could have won.  one kid scratched four times on the long jump.  and the amazing joe feeney actually lost the 1600, which really should never have happened.
on the plus side, i chopped two seconds off my 400 time, and helped get third place out of seven teams in the 4x4.  jennifer got first place in the 100, and some of the guys got first and seconds in a lot of the sprinting stuff.  anyway, i'm kind of tired from that right now. 
and the orange peel fight with carolyn.  that was pretty intense.  and the several games of ... whatever that thing's called, where you stand square with eachother and try to push the other person over only hitting their hands... anyway, me and chris krassa had a massive war of that, i think the final tally was 8-6- which is a lot given the leigth and intensity that two well balanced individuals can give to the game.

no school tomorrow!  wohoo!  i'll probably spend it in front of the computer, working on a lightsaber movie me and carolyn shot a couple weeks ago, but couldn't get onto the computer because someone ran off with the cleaning tape for the video camera.  good fun.

anyway, hope things are cool out there."

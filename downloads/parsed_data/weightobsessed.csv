"event","Hello:

I've been watching this site for about a month and a half now; I Love it!  It's so nice to know there's a place for ED's like us.  I have had an ED now for over 20 years.  It's hard to let go of.  It's nice to know there's a place like this for support.  I hope everybody made it through Thansgiving alright; I hate that day!  It should be banned.  Anyway, I did okay; I refused to eat anything....Think Thin :)

"event","How is everyone going to deal with Thanksgiving?  I absolutely HATE IT!!!  It's the only day of the year that I dread coming!  I have such a hard time every year with it.  I'm obsessed with my weight, and hate being 'forced' to go to my parent's house, or my in-laws to eat.  It's the most terrifying, awful thing for me to have to do...
Anybody have any suggestions on what they do?? Thanks.

"event","Hello I'm new here; I was just wondering if anyone is having the same problems I am about loosing weight.  I run almost everyday; go to the gym and work out, and eat almost nothing; but, I cannot seem to loose any weight!!  My lowest weight was 103, now I'm back at 110 lbs; I'm 5'7"" tall.  I really want to get back to my 'old self' but I'm having a hard time.  It seems no matter how little or no food that I eat, it doesn't matter, I cannot seem to loose anything!  It's so frustrating!
Can anyone give me ideas on how to loose these pounds??!!  Thanks."

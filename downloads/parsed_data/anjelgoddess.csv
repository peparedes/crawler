"event","<P>Trevor and I are doing...okay. I finally registered for my classes. I'm not taking any classes with Trevor. He is doing concurrent enrollment at CCCC and UTD. I'm going to work on getting credits to transfer to Austin College in a year or two depending on what I decide. I also want to do some studying abroad because I've always wanted to. I don't know what I want to do yet. Still undecided on my major. I don't know what Trevor plans to do.</P>
<P> I'm afraid that I won't be seeing Trevor as often this year as last year. We don't have any classes together. I'm choosing to start on a path that will lead me to Austin college which Trevor has no interest in. It almost feels like we are starting to pull apart and I don't want that to happen.</P> 
  <P> Coming home from registering my mother gave me a lecture that made me break down in tears when I saw Trevor tonight. My mother told me not to make the same mistake she did. She married her high school sweetheart right out of high school and then started college. Her husband wasn't very supportive of her going to school so she stopped going. She ended up divorcing him. But she told me she realized that she had put her dreams aside just to stay with her high school sweetheart. She told me that I need to go ahead and go straight through school and go to austin college since I want to and not to worry about what Trevor does. She told me to go on and study abroad like I want to for a year. Even if it means that I come back and find that Trevor has forgotten me and found someone else. That upset me but I managed not to cry in front of my mother. That is never a good idea.</P> 
   <P> When I went over to Trevor's house tonight I told him what my mother told me. Trevor told me that I should go on to austin college and study abroad since I want to because I will always regret it if I dont'. Then he said if I am gone for a year and come back maybe we will decide that we aren't good for each other after all. Maybe it will help us see that we just aren't meant to be. I couldn't help it I cried after he told me that. That's always been my fear that he will decide that I'm just not right for him. If I go abroad for a year he will probably find someone else while I'm gone. Then I come back and surprise he didn't wait for me. I know that if I don't go and study abroad I will regret but I will regret going abroad and studying for the rest of my life if it causes me to lose Trevor. :( I think I scared him by crying so much but I couldn't help it. </P>"

"event","College orientation was so boring. It started at nine in the morning and finished at three in the afternoon. I mean they did tell us lots of useful stuff but did they really have to make it that long. I still haven't registered for any classes yet. Mom wants me to go tomorrow and get it all worked out. I'm feeling a little better about myself today. Again I have no idea why.
<P> I got to see Trevor today. I haven't seen him since last Saturday I think. He told me that he really missed me. Bethany came in and wanted to play Dynasty Warriors 4. I beat her in most of the versus matches which made me feel good because she usually brags at how much better than me she is. Sad that I feel good about beating someone in a video game isn't it."

"event","I have no idea what is wrong with me today. I just feel so sad. I'm having one of those times in life where you feel like you've completely wasted your life. I've spent most of the summer being a complete bum. I haven't cleaned my room or done my chores that I'm suppose to do. I'm 18 years old I don't have a job and I never have had a job except for babysitting. I still don't know how to drive a car. I've just been to scared to learn. I haven't registered yet for my college classes which I've been told are filling up really fast that it's hard to get into a required course now. I've been happy until today wasting time on neopets and watching TV. After how hard I worked this last year in high school I was burned out on working. <P>Now I realize that with my grades I could have gone to any college that I wanted to in the state but I didn't apply to any. Why? Because I was afraid to leave home. I also didn't want to go to far from home because of my boyfriend. People are always telling me not to not do things just because of him. They keep telling me that most boyfriends just don't work out. But with him it's different and I don't think that they could possibly understand this. I couldn't help crying earlier tonight about how messed up and worthless I feel right now. Then listening to my friend's troubles and only hoping that I have given them the right advice. Keeping what I know a secret from my boyfriend is killing me because I hate keeping things from him. Now he knows that I'm keeping a secret because I was crying when I was talking to him on the phone. He thought I was going to break up with him just because I said I didn't want to see him tonight. That wasn't entirely true I just didn't want him to see me cry. How can you love someone and trust them with so much and then not want them to see you cry? I'm beginning to wonder what he can possibly see in me? I don't know if he could understand all of this. And then there is everything about me that he does not know. I'll have to tell him someday. Will he still look at me the same way when he knows everything? Will I ever have the courage to tell him everything? Am I overreacting to this whole thing? I don't even know what really brought this mood on. It just sort of happened and there I was crying. I cry too much I really do. </P><P>Tomorrow I have my wonderful college orientation day. I hope I'm in a better mood before seeing the academic adviser. They will really worry about me if I break down in tears in front of them. Then Mom will know something is wrong with me and play twenty questions with me. I hate it when she does that.
<P> Then there is my food problem. I don't have an eating disorder because I know my body shape and size looks okay. But I just can't eat sometimes. I just think that sometimes I don't deserve food or sometimes that it is just to much effort to fix something to eat. Like tonight I didn't eat dinner I just didn't feel in the mood to eat. What kind of person isn't in the mood to eat? That's not normal it just can't be. I don't think I'm clinically depressed or anything because I'm usually happy okay not perky the whole world is a wonderful place happy but happy enough."

"event","Well I actually saw Trevor last night without crying my eyes out. It was so hard to let go of him when he drove me home. We must have stood on my doorstep for 5 minutes before we pulled apart and he left. His family left sometime this morning. I stayed up all night talking to people on chat rooms. I guess being on the computer a lot almost takes my mind off him being gone. Of course I've written out a long list of things I need to do before I leave for vacation this coming saturday. Hopefully that list will keep me occupied."

"event","I always knew that one day I would walk across a stage and get my diploma but some how I never thought I would. It was always too far ahead to even think about. Now I face the vast uncertainty of my future and it absolutley terrifies me. For years I've waited to be free from those who picked on me just because I was the quiet one. I didn't have it as bad as some but the taunting still hurt. Now that I no longer have to see these people on a daily basis I find that I miss them. At least with hight school I knew what to expect. Each year seeing the same old people and a few new ones knowing how each would act.
In August I start college I can hardly believe it. First I have to make it through the summer. Once again I will be separated from my wonderful boyfriend Trevor. Last summer my family vacations separated me from him for five weeks. This summer we will be separated for three. He leaves this Saturday for a week, my family leaves next Saturday and won't return for two weeks. It nearly killed me being away from him for so long. I missed him so much. By the second week I was very moody snapping at everyone for the stupidest things then apologising later. I cried several times while clutching the stuffed puppy dog he had given me before I left. 
I missed the simpliest things about him. I longed to hear the sound of his voice, his laughter. I wanted to be able to look in his eyes especially the one look that simply melts my heart. Last summer I had only been going out with him for about seven months. I was so afraid that he would forget me but he didn't. I now know that those fears were foolish as he has promised me that he will never leave me. But tomorrow I will see him for last time before our family vacations. I only hope I don't fall to pieces in front of him I don't like people to see me cry. I don't know if I can stand the burning ache inside of me when I can't see him for so long."

Some guy that looks like Charlie Manson bought me a diet coke on his way home and his parting words were ""Tell Cleat Brian is looking for dirty love"". I ran back in side the cab and locked the doors. However 3 girls got in tonight and I was speaking of my single days and offering to ""bake cakes"" when one of these young ladies said the guy is only supposed to bring the icing. Nothing but freaks and weirdos in Big Daddy Land.

As fun as it would be to drink till I puke and ask everyone what happened after I blacked out, I have to return to big daddy land. Things that did not happen to me last night:
I didnt try to fight a girl on her bday or make sexist remarks
I didnt remember anything
I didnt puke on anyone
I didnt have a bad time

"event","I love to drink. I hate strip clubs. More improtantly I hate to drink at strip clubs because then I am ""forced"" to give naked girls money. As most of you now know I am a partial owner of the Big Daddy Taxi empire, which means I have more money (doh!) to give to naked girls if I go out. After spending 50 bones at Hooters and about 200 (bob owes me fifty) at cheetahs and getting absolutely nothing out of it besides a dehydrated belly and an empty wallet, I am doing it again tonight and tomorrow at CMU. Why am I such a glutton for punishment? Responses welcome :-)"

"event","WOW...so much has happened. I got the bestest girlfriend on the world, she has the two most amazing rugrats on the world. Um, I went to Kentucky and saw a detailed road map of the state, drank alot, wore a mullett wig and pretended to love nascar legend DICK FUCKIN TRICKLE and acted so hillbilly I even fooled the locals. Got a new ride, new djing gig to pay off the new ride. Working on some music stuff and some promotion stuff on the side. I live a pretty boring yet challenging life. I went from a drunk 24 year old horny male, to a 24 year old business man and father figure virtually over night. Its one of the greatest changes I think I have ever witnessed anyone go through. I saw Bryan Adams, Def Leppard, Sum 41, and MOTLEY FREAKIN CRUE this summer. One of my brothers and I are tighter than ever, I never want to see the other one again (and if I do I will be sure to poke him in the jimmy with a very sharp stick. Other than that I eat, I sleep, I shit, I shave. I need to have a balls to the wall party or do one last crazy thing with my life. Why, I dont know. Happy as I freaking am there is a very little mischievous person inside me saying I need to get drunk and sleep outside naked. Invite the haters (fuck you guys...hehe), the congratulators, sinners and saints, role models and those needing guidance, and pave a very crooked road to my little house of horrors. My good buddy Houla is moving away. We got drunk last night with dom and steve and hung out at their frat house after i dod some promo shit up here. I wandered around and was just sort of quiet all night. Im getting old, people are getting married, moving away, or both. I am going a million miles an hour and have no idea where I am headed. I dont care and I will know when I get there. I have to wake people up for breakfast, im fucking starving. Later biznitches!"

"event","This is a short segemnt of the journal where I will relapse to my previous living arrangement which was in Mt. Pleasant Michigan. For those of you who are unaquanted with the largest shithole on Earth here are the few defing factors: #1 A really big Casino on a  really big Native American reservation. #2 Central Michigan University, home of the whoreiest of whories (just ask cleazy). #3 A small job market with mediocre ($6.00 an hour) pay and too many bars to make ends meet on that kind of budget. 
     The first time I had people up (willie d and his cousin, cheez, my brothers) we started pre-drinking. (Prelude)I was at the Bottle and Barrell party store getting beer and hitting on the hottie at the counter, i left, went to start my car...its always nice to hit on girls when you dont need jumper cables. Anywho, massive amounts of drinking and what not occur at the apartment. Fun is had by all, then we leave for the Wayside (bar with a dj in Mount Pleasant, a GAY SHITTY PIECE OF SHIT DJ). Things are going good...I see cheez hitting on a fat girl and a skinny girl at the pool tables. I take the skinny girl beer and quickly take over the situation. We are having fun and buying rounds and what not, I don't even have time to get her number before security is carrying us out of the bar because willie d's 20 year old cousin got kicked out for drinking. I slept in the car for a few hours, stumbled up stairs to go to bed. The next day (astonished to see the apartment was empty)i go to toss my cheese wrapper in the trash and it hit the floor...my trash can...in my empty apartment (no furniture, no tv, no nothing), hit the floor. I moved the trash can, finished making breakfast and when i looked up, there was a ""head-sized"" hole in my wall. I called my roommate O and asked if that was there before we moved in (at 8am) he said no. I went down the list of attendees I thought would do soemthing so utterly bogus, calling cheez and willie d and they both denied. I didn't think my brothers were capable, so I drove back home after arriving at my apartment the night before to find out they were the ones who infact, got drunk , wrestled, and speared the other onces head into my wall. Anger ensued.
    The next night of drinking came shortly there after, day of drinking if you will. The girl I was seeing (sort of, long story. let us refer to her as the devil's advocate. Everyone knows the real devil is Patty Pfalert)  started some sort of BS and since she no longer lived in that apartment (i sub-lent from her) i TOLD her to leave. It didnt take much with what I had said before then, getting her to leave was quite easy. My roommate and his then gf (who we will refer to as the bicycle, because everyone rides a bicycle) woke up (around 1030 am) to me with a half gallon of bacardi, a 2 lieter of coke, a 64 oz mug, and an evil mad look on my face. They knew this was going to be a long day. After I woke back up I called Houla to come over and help me drink and have a good time. After my second cup (with no food all day) O and Houla made me noodles because they are swell. However I was not swell, I was wasted and wanted to go to the bar. Houla and I left for the wayside (for those of you who know Mount Pleasant shut your yappers it was the closest place with loud music). I guess he says I bought lots of beer and shots which is good. Now for what is bad; I fell asleep on the way to Rubbles (awesome dive rock bar just off of main amd mission...i think). He intoduces his friend B to my face which is squished, sleeping, and drooling on the window. He drives me to his place to return to rubbles. I was beyond ""adam drunk"" at this point. His mom was ""sitting"" his place as we terrorized Mount Pleasant. She woke up to me barfing on the dog. WHY ADAM BARFED ON THE DOG: #1 A half gallon of Bacardi #2 I ate noodles. #3 I wasn't asleep, wasn't awake, nor was I conscience, but when the dog licked my mouth thats all he wrote. I heard someone screaming about a drunk friend and I have a soft spot for mothers, I clenched my fist and bit my tounge. Houla arrived shortly to be temporarily hated by his mom (god bless her for not gutting me) and drove me (puking noodles on the side of his car and all) back to my apartment. My roommate 0 and the Bicycle carried me upstairs and tossed me in the shower. She came in to check on me when I was screaming at the top of my lungs ""Dont look at my donger you skank!"" repeatedly (and for some reason she blames me for the break up). She was a skank and prolly wanted my donger, anyway...I woke up the next morning fine except, when I woke up I had no idea what happened.

"event","Wow...I havent been here in a minute. Nothing too interesting has happened lately. Let me run down some events for you. 
MY BIRTHDAY- Melissa and I have the same birthdays. Cool because Melissa is as cool the other side of the pillow. Not cool because they make the kind of jello shots that dont like to solidify. So after some captain and coke, mass quanities of taste testing and jello shots, we leave for ricks all american cafe, where i start double fisting Whiskey SOurs (my newest fav). I put a shot glass in my back pocket (i had to), I gave my weed beads (from mardi gras) to christina (super hot) to see her boobies (only boobies I remember from the bar). I guess I was dancing, drinking, and seeing boobies...then I ruined it for myself. I went into the kitchen took (into the kitchen), took two slices of pizza, and walked out. They asked for money and I told them it was my birtday, ask someone else for money. They threw me out..dickheads.

St. Pattys Day- I worked. However well in advance I asked my boss for that friday off because I am sober when I am smart. I started getting drunk dialed by dwight and andy around 11ish. They are troopers...reminds me of my former self. Anywho...after a LONG day at work...I start drinking in the shower. I couldnt wait, yes im a drunk, fuck off. Josh and I head to the bar. Many green beers, dirty girl scouts, and Irish Carbombs later (tab= greater than $100) I am ""Adam Drunk"". at this point my roomate josh (sober weriner) suggesting i close my tab. I do. About 10 minutes later when I find out its my turn for shots i open another one and take off before i pay(a $75 one which my roomate signed asshole instead of adam house, maybe he was drunk after all). During the 2nd tab i almost started a fight with a differnt roomate and his freidns, poured green beer on my brother and then of course...left without closiing my tab. My little asked me for his green beer back, so i dumped it on him, not good. He followed me outside and i slept in his car onteh way home (i rolled on him in my sleep in the car, for those of you who know aaron this is not good...but we made it here anyway). WHen i got back to my house..i went to casyes car and fell asleep just as he was trying to leave. He was not happy and could pummell me sober or drunk...however he just laughed as I told him to fuck off and that his car was really mine (got..what a good kid) I lost my timbo's for about a month, broke the mustard, and destroyed the house before everyone got home. I woke up intime for work, I even got ready. When i called cheez, he reminded me i took the day off. Im never taking that day off again.

Other than that...went on a few dates, got some def leppard tickets (screw you they still rock), going to Kentucky at the end of may, and prolly drinking till i cant see my shoes, or covering my shoes with puke. Either way, i wont be able to see them. Im off till I drink Again...till then...

"event","I received a comment to the  ""Why the asshole hat fits me so well post"" Today. When I read it I was slightly amused and greatly annoyed. If someone wants to tell a story, they must first get it right (also reason due to the lack of posts lately, none of us can really piece the nights together)
If you haven't read that story (mentioned above), please do so by clicking the following: http://www.livejournal.com/users/ajhouse20/610.html

After reading, I hope that you will see I am more than a strwen mess of curse words. Thank you all :-D

Her Response:
Their reply was:

    Subject: Being an ASS
    I am a female and I feel the need to stand up for all girls that you everyday put down and belittle. We are sick of you guys thinking you are hot and your shit dont stink. NEWS FLASH..it does. You know what though I can take a joke and I think that it is sometimes funny when you are mean to people but enough is enough. We can only laugh at it for so long....It seems to me that you give girls a hard time by being a dick to them that way you can turn them off automatically and save yourself the embarassement of them possibly seeing your very small penis.....smart I must say I do give you credit for that.....But moving on... maybe if you didn't waste so much time being a dick you would make a new friend...some girls are actually cool as fuck and smart and beautiful and they even have common sense...Imagine that you fuck.

My Rebuttle:
     Lets add this address this being an ass issue. 
1. You posted anonymously.  You obviously know me. You are also more than likely upset that we treat you like shit (also meaning you know my roommates and more than likely attend Baker College).  Only a chicken would hide their true colors.
2. To let you know, you girls (most of you are far from being ladies. Those of you whom I deem to be closer to being a lady, I'm sure its only due to the fact I don't know you as well.). And justly so, we treat(ed) you as such. For your information, you have been treated the worse out of any girl(s) that have been to this house mainly because each and all of you are ignorant enough to come back for more. Therefore, we were hoping to automatically turn you off, however ignorance is bliss, isn't it?
3. For those of you who have seen my small penis, aren't you equally as embarassed to admit you've seen it. I'm small and I am proud. I will show the world.
4. The only real joke here is you. You should have been looking for the signs, however you were too busy paying attention to how un-hot we are and how stinkless our shit is

5. Also if your claims are false and we have never treated you like shit, I would like to personally extend you an invitation to come over for a night or torment and hell courtesy my fellow conspiritors and I. Nothing would make any of us happier than proving you how small minded and arrogant you are.

Next time you choose to retort, I highly suggest you do it when you have bullets in your barrells, or know more than what you have witnessed when you are the only ones here or read some slightly exaggerated version of what happened (That is ofcourse besides those in the messanger format, that was copied and pasted.) Thank you and good evening lovers, haters, and loyal followers.

P.S. I hope this shows all of you when slightly pertrubed I do have a vocabulary larger than that of a sailor."

"event","Ok yeah I said frat, and for those of you in a frat and don't like the fact I didn't say fraternity fuck yourselves. For those of you who know me, you know I would not join a frat or seldomly would I associate with anyone of the greek scene (Besides those PKT's at CMU. Those guys always show me a good time (See ""Adam+Shots=Angry Bitches"")). I live in the I Phelta Thi house and they call me Rico. Once the house is done being remodled pictures will be provided online. This will be perhaps one of the coolest places I ever spend my time. I've slept on the couch, on the floor, on the stairs, and on my bed. I've woken up hoping my arm was stuck in a bear trap and woke up wondering how drunk the girl next to me must have been to wind up where she was. We are yet to have any kind of application process or initiation. That is soon to come. We allow hazing as well. If anyone is dumb enough to do something the regret we will drag them over broken glass before we let them forget about how much of a jack ass they are. If you are interested in I Phelta Thi you may e-mail me at ajhouse20@gmail.com Men and women alike are welcome to join. Women, if you don't want to join you are always welcome for the night.

"event","Thursday-Wow. I am thankful that I lived to tell about this night. I drank hard, I drank fast. We (RS) were at the bar for LESS than 2 hours before getting asked to leave. Surprisingly RS was the one who got kicked out. In that time I drank 3 shots of tequila, 1 shot of jager, 1 bombay and tonic, and 4 schooners. To a rookie this would generally equal death. To me, well I'll get to that. Apperantly I danced with some good looking girl from what jmac tells me. So thanks for the pick me up (my beer goggles need to be returned - enough said, you'll read more later). Thankfully I treated all of my co-workers (with the exception of RS which I will get to) with respect. Apperantly I made a few phone calls on RS's phone, which came up missing. We get to RS's and a flop face first on the couch and begin vomiting. Not like a drank to much and some liquid came out. This is vomit like last weeks ramen noodles, my socks and shoes, you name it, it came out of my mouth. From what I was told I damn near turned inside out. After this I decided I had to pee. I missed the toilet, but not the bathroom floor (my aim was exemplary) as I covered the bathroom floor with my urine. Anyone want to buy me shots or call me out again, thats how I will pay you back.

Friday- I lived to make it into work. Which went ok then I departed for Mount Pleasant to see Cleazy and O. Cleazy and I got the clever idea to tell everyone we are brothers. We are smart because girls think its cute when brothers hang out. There was a party acrossed the hall from O's and after I talked Cleazy into putting his vagina away, packing his balls and coming with me we had a pretty good time. We walk in - drunk freshman spots me. This is good. She wobbles up to me (half because of her thigh-cle, half because she is tanked) and she says Hi I am ""blank""; we will call her dumbass for all intensive purposes. I proceed to dance with her as she wiggles like a half dead fish on a beach in mid July. I get annoyed and go back to O's for beer when I meet Tristan and this other guy (I forget his name because I really don't think he is as cool as we are). They are about to do this one chick - on Cleazy's bed. SWEET! At least someone is going to use it. I go back to the party, mingle with slobbering hookers who don't know how to handle their booze, get bored, tell dumbass I'll be back and when I go to steves I see ""guy 1"" and Tristan and they are not happy. It turns out ""finger-cuffs"" just walked out on them. I would have at least dumped my beer on her (this is why I am an asshole I guess, and others are not). ""Guy 1"" who I will now refer to for the rest of this story as douche`bag is upset because this girl he liked got pissed that he was going to tag the hooker. Cleazy and I come to the rescue and we go talk to her. I really think she wanted to do me for a number of reasons. A: She seemed remotely interested B: We live somewhat near eachother = fuckbuddy within driving distance C: I love beer. So we send them away to go talk and I see dumbass come out with her freind who refused to get naked when she asked me for money (bitch). He friend gets to the end of the hall, spills her beer (i.e. : Pukes Violently) and leaves. Dumbass is eliminated from the equation. The girl douche`bag likes comes back to steves, walks right by douche`bag and sits next to me. I don't shit in another guys back yard especailly when he is sitting there watching. My first comment to her is: ""I am not going to talk to you unless you agree to let me fuck you in the ass."" She said what in disbelief, she left after I asked her the second time. Being an asshole is so much fun. I fall asleep on the couch by myself around 5:30am

Saturday - Its 8:30am and there are fireworks going off and the guys wake me up for free food. I excused the thought of shitting in their beds because free food is 3rd in life next to free beer and sex (in that order if you are taking notes). FYI - Hot chicks make shitty pancakes. I ate the eggs and I thought I was going to shit my asscheeks raw. Oh well, it was free. Then we get 60 beers for about 25$ and head to tailgating. Central Michigan does NOT know how to tailgate. Anyway I see douche`bag and Tristan. Tristan and I walk around for a while he introduces me to a number of girls who dont yet know how bad they want to have sex with me. Then we get an idea: Its Central/Western weekend; Halloween Party at O's! We declare ourselves the smartest people on the planet and talk to about 60 girls about the party. We then tell O about his party. O is not happy. I get snuck into the game and ridicule people with Tristan. We have fun making fun of cheerleaders and dumbasses at the game. Fear of inclimate weather forces us to leave. We go to the frat house and hang out. A couple fat chicks come in who knows O's ex. Cleazy and I call her everything but a saint to their faces because it is fun and she is by far the dumbest girl I have ever met...times 3. I go dj, that goes well. It was a dry event. I go to the hick bar down the road to celebrate my cousin's, wife's birthday. They are hammered I am sober and slightly annoyed. We drink for about an hour till everyone (except for me) says they are too drunk to drink anymore (A: Because I am still sober and B: There is no such thing).I go home and crash...vowing not to drink for a ""LONG TIME"". 
No I didn't take the time to spell check, fuck your couch!"

"event","I get out of work at 11pm. A girl from work invited me to this Hillbilly bar called The Main, in a Hillbilly town called Ovid. I've been here   once before, not a bad time, so I decieded to go. I called my cousin Rich who lives just down the street from here to corrall his boys incase she isn't enough trouble for me (very rare that one girl is enough trouble for the one and only...). I get to the bar, locate everyone, slam a beer. Josh, (one of my cousins friends, not the roommate you will hear of in other posts) found $50 on the floor and was spending it wisely, till he got to me. He bought me a shot of Jager. Jager+Adam=barf. AT this trip the the bar I bought a budlight and a captain and coke. I do the shot, slam the rum and coke to get that nasty taste out of my mouth, and begin nursing my beer. This is when the women around us begin to call me out (hookers). So I slam the rest of that beer and get a shot of Tequila and another beer (I love ,multi tasking). I began feeling drunk (IE: Shartfaced) when I start dancing and talking to who appears to be the sleaziest girls in the bar. Leah my ""friend"" finds it in my best interest to pull me away. I love it when ""freinds""...""lookout"" for me when I am shartfaced. I begin dancing with another girl who seemed to be slightly sleazy and yet again got ""saved"" by my cousins wife, who at this point probably feels like a ""superhero"" for ""saving"" me from sleazy girl #4,456,234. 
After this thank god its closing time. My ""freind"" Leah and I leave to go to a party. We get there and I think about the recent events. My thought process goes as follows: Sleazy girl #1 **""Muffed"" ; Sleazy girl #2 ""Muffed""; Sleazy girl #4,456,234 ""Muffed""
So I say lets go back to my place. After about 20 minutes of my place I do my standard shartfaced move: Pass out  ---Time Warp---I have a voicemail on my phone Sunday afternoon which goes: "" Adam I had a great time with you and everyone last night, Sorry I wasn't exciting enough to keep you awake."" HAHAHA! Sweet, I play it for my roommates and we have a good laugh. I talk to Leah today and this is the short of the long of it; Apperantly she woke me a while later. I went to the bathroom for about 10 minutes and came out with out my pants on. She said I looked tired, so I mutterd some slurred drunkeese back to her and went downstairs to my room. I did not return. She ended up leaving at 5:30am. You all know between close and this time there is no way it took that long to realize A: This loser passed out B: This loser is drunk and passed out or C: What the fuck am I doing here. 
I some how woke up with my pants on. I remember this becauase I wasn't nearly as drunk when I woke up as I was when I passed out. Some people  deny this but I am a believer. Miracles are only 7 beers, 2 shots, and a mixed drink away. TTFN!

**Muffed - My person term  referring to a cockblock laid down by a female. I think its funny kiss my ass."

"event","Wow. I was wasted. It was all good. I got out at 11:00pm for the first time in about 5 weeks and I released myself on the public. Why not? I went to a house party with some friends of mine and the jackasses hid the keg in what had to be the most congested corner in the house. Not Smart. I began drinking excessively because A: I could and B: I wanted to. I was drinking at a rate of 3-1 in comparison of my freinds. I was feeling good till I started to buzz. I wasn't about to wait for my beer. So if I am rude people will move. If you tell girls they are ugly and you would rather go to bed with their mother they will not want to be anywhere near you. And the guys by the keg will laugh hysterically and fill your cup for you asap to get you out and the chicks back inside. I told the two ""rookies"" working the keg how smart they were then told them to fill my beer. I like being the older guy at a party because not caring what some homely, stupid, 18 year old girl thinks of you, and you verify that by telling her how stupid she is and that everyone would be smarter if she just stopped bitching is fantabulous. I was at a house party and I was getting served before the girls. This was heaven. But all good things come to an end. We walked to my friend's apartment after buying some beer only to sit up talking till 5:00am. They say you repeat yourself when you are drunk.They say you repeat yourself when you are drunk.They say you repeat yourself when you are drunk.They say you repeat yourself when you are drunk.They say you repeat yourself when you are drunk.They say you repeat yourself when you are drunk. I woke up drove to my place for the Lions game which was dope because we got to watch it on a projector. If you don't understand take me to the movies. I got drunk with my dad and it was great. Now I am at work and the highlight of my night: MY SHIT SMELLS LIKE BUD LIGHT. I love my job."

tonight was wicked funnnn.
but i'll get to that after.
today i got up and drove to dartmouth for my doctors appointment.
NO WORRIES PEOPLE I STILL HAVE A PULSE! --in case you were wondering.
so then we drove all the way back home.
and i slept the whole way.
and slept some more at home.
i need to sleep at night more. it makes more sense. 
hm but anywayssss...
tonight..
me and matt went to the movies.
britt and steve couldnt go.
so it was just us. 
and we decided it was a date.
sooo he picked me up. 
lol he drove by my house like 4 times. 
so i finally went outside to meet him.
and he came up and mom met him.
thennn we hit every red light in the city of concord.
there was like, no one at the movies. 
and we were the only two seeing the skeleton key.
it was an allright movie i guess. 
the end was good.
so im adding this for brittany's sake: we held hands during the movie.
and made out in his car after. 
lol that reminds me of that movie...what is it?
oh yea..riding in cars with boys. 
so um then he brought me home.
I GOT HIS GREEN SWEATSHIRT. hahah i <3 it. and there is a secret pocket and there were post it notes in it. lol how random.
so anyways. then i talked to britt for like ever.
and talked to ppl online for a while.
then matt called to say goodnight.
and i figured i'd update quick before i go to bed.
i have school tomorrow. which sucks. but oh well.
janels coming over after school.
shes gonna be jealous. shes like, in love with matt.
haha. goodnight <3<3

friday=brittany coming over and like, sleeping over and stuff. we went to nanas and made ham roll ups. and hung out with janel and megan and ppl. then we came home and both janel and britt slept at my house.

saturday=long story.
we got up and frantically got ready. i wore a gorgeous <B>fuck-me</B> dress. and i curled my hair. it looked awesome. and brit and janel wore awesome dresses too. and i did their hair. and jon came and picked mom and all of us up. the we went to the wedding. gina looked freaking drop-dead gorgeous. her and bryan were so cute together. anthony walked her down the aisle and the ceremony was awesome. the party was wicked fun. me and brit changed after the wedding was over tho. the heels were killing me. we wore matching skirts lol it was funny. sooo we called steve and matt to see what they were doing and they came and picked us up.
they drove by nanas road like 4 times lol and then finally turned in and met mom and aunt lori (scary!) and we went to the park. me and brit tried to steal matts car but its a standard so we couldnt drive it.
we went back to nanas to get drinks and stuff (pay attention because the visits to nanas come into play later) and then we drove to the conservation center. walked along the yellow dirt road and i stole matts pimp green sweatshirt. ha he gave it to me not brit. <B>i win!</B> and my new name is matt and britt is steve. we stole their name tags from work. and britt lost steves but she found it. so we hung by the river for a while and matt picked me up and was going to throw me into the river. not very nice btw =P 
so we went back to nanas and the boys had to go home. it was sad. i had to give the sweatshirt back. and then me and britt were bored.

this is the long part. after the boys left, like an hour later, aunt sheila told me that megs checkbook, janels camera, and $300 was missing from the house. wow so then they asked if it was matt and steve and i was like hellllll no. then uncle bobby said 2 people saw the boys in the back room. and me and britt started thinking it might be them. so we freaked out and called them and they both denied it. then the cops got involved and we had to tell the cop everything we knew and all the boys information and everything. it was so fucked up. cuz then i talked to steve again and uncle marc talked to him too and we realized they couldnt have done it. and we're stupid for thinking they did. and the cops called their houses and interrogated them and stuff. but the camera and checkbook were found this morning at nanas so the cash cant be traced anyways. so they wont get in trouble. but believe me....me and brit told matt and steve that we were <B>wicked wicked wicked</B> sorry. and they dont hate us. they still <3 us so its all good. but im tired. and this entry took me 4 hours to finish. cuz i kept stopping every 10 seconds and forgetting about it.

im cold and tired so goodnight.

"event","hm. what a funnn weekend!
thursday kenzie picked me up from school. we went to my house to get all my stuff to sleep over. then we drove to andover and ate dinner at pizza chef. we were stuffed. then we went to her house and dealt with some boyfriend drama (hers of course lol) and just hung out. kenzie is a slave in her home by the way. so i slept there.

friday we got up and got ready for the football game and just hung out. her parents slaughtered a pig WHILE I WAS THERE. who does that? it was sad. um...so kenzie drove us to penacook and met mom there. she went to the football game but i came home and brit came over. we walked to memorial field at like 9 at night and there was another football game just ending so we went home and she talked to her (hot) friend sean on the phone for like 2 hours.

saturday me and brit ended up just going to nanas and hanging out there getting stuff ready for brian and ginas wedding. which is next weekend and i cant wait forrrr!! me and brit spray painted rocks lol for the backyard and then went to sears and i got a really cute outfit. then aunt lori and brenda brought us to beefside. god i love their roast beef sandwiches. and me and brit talked to sean and decided to meet him at the hopkinton fair. aunt lori dropped us off and we got lost and couldnt find the gate for like, ever. it was funny. but we finally did. and then we wandered for a little while and sean called brits cell and we met him by the ferris wheel.

omg he was with his friend ethan and he was so fuckin funny. he was kinda cute too but a total dumbass. it took him a minute to figure out sean stopped walking and was hanging with us. hm...then we saw seans friend ron and hung out with him. he was gorgeous. he bought us all tickets and we went on a couple spinny rides. then me and ron went on apollo cuz no one else would. then brianne called me and said she was there to pick us up and that sucked. so we were walking away from her cuz she didnt see us and i was like ""its not like she knows me from my back"" and ron goes, well i do. haha he was soooo fine. he had like tattoos everywhere and his nipples pierced. and omg he said he had his *ahem* dick pierced. haha thats awesome im sorry. so he kept like ""accidentally"" touching my ass and shit. it was funny. 

sean and ethan got in trouble for smoking and they had to go and sean kissed brittanyyyyyyy! she like, melted. lol and then i had to get my purse out of rons car cuz i left it there. and then we had to meet brianne somewhere and leave. but it was a VERY fun night. aunt lori was pissed cuz we slept over nanas and we were an hour later than we said we'd be. but she got over it.

so me and brit were laying in bed and i had a kickass headache and my head was still spinning from the rides so i got up and puked my brains out. i've never thrown up that much in my life. it was mcnastyyyy. but i felt 242130577982 times better after. then i fell asleep peacefully lol =P

sundayyyyy we didnt do anything. we hung out at nanas for a little while and then came home and set up the attic so we could hang out up there. its wicked cool. i have my stereo and a fan and a light up there. its a pimpin little set-up =P we ate oreos and peanut butter and then talked to steve. played an interesting game of truth with him. lol then mom freaked out cuz we were up at 1 am so we went to sleep. 

today brit went home early. and i took a shower. and cleaned my room. and now im doing nothing. waiting for someone to call so i have something to do. damn. it kind of sucks. CALL ME DAMMIT!

"event","last weekend was actually really fun. 
i was just in a really bad mood.
pissed off at people and i didnt wanna go back to andover.

mom brought me to the beach and i saw annika for the first time in like 7 years or something. we used to play together at nanas all the time and then i moved and we didnt really talk anymore. but now shes gonna be a sophomore at chs so i'll hopefully see her. and we're going to hang out and stuff. at the beach we hung out with janel and i bought a sweatshirt, a louis vuitton purse, a necklace, some green and white etnies, and 2 really cute star bracelets. thats the only good part to working...getting paid. anyways back to the beach..some really sketchy guy came up to us saturday night and asked us how old we were and he started hitting on us and shit. he was 17 i think and a total fag...his best line? ""how's that ice cream?"" hahaha im not even kidding. flamer. needless to say we didnt talk long. and sunday i called two little girls fucking bitches because they cut janel in line at the store and she tried to tell them to move so i went up to them and tried to be nice and they refused to move so i was like fucking bitches and they looked shocked so me and janel left. little girls are so..lame. 

hm..so we had to go home sunday and monday morning i went back to andover to fucking babysit for another week. this week went by faster and im soooooo glad its over. no more babysitting. ever. unless i get poor. ha i got paid another $250 so im going cell phone shopping sometime. i need one. so jackie (janels nana) is letting me go on her plan. you dont know how happy this makes me.

im gonna go because i need a nap before i have to go to briannes for a cookout. those kids get up at freaking 7 in the morning. so i need some sleep.

i've been in andover all week babysitting.
its kind of like hell..but with popsicles.
thats all that those kids eat.
and um, linda and mike (their parents) put me in steves room to sleep.
let me tell you, that was friggin weird.
meghans wicked jealous =P
he wasnt home though.
cuz he was at football camp all week.

for real, if i didnt get the $250 that i did, i guarantee i would not go back next week.
but im going to.
cuz im poor and need moneyyyy.

um, i didnt get much sleep while i was there.
i had to get up at *shock!* 8 in the morning. 
but didnt go to bed til like 11 or something.
not very smart.

linda taught me how to crochet.
im making a bag now.
adrian (younger kid) got stung by a bee and screamed bloody murder.
i thought he WAS being murdered.
um, we went to the beach almost every day.
i had kenzie meet us there one day but she brought nicole.
so i couldnt really talk to her.
omg, i somehow got strept throat the day before i started babysitting.
and just found out that its strept TODAY.
so they had me on the wrong medicine.
and it wasnt helping.
and my tonsils look like ""moldy raw meatballs"" according to devon.
hes not too far off.
so i cant swallow but i really feel fine except for my throat.
no fevers or shit like that.
dammit, now im rambling...

holy shit i almost forgot.
im getting a kitten!
in a month cuz he/shes too young right now.
but i got a picture and i named it Wheatie.
its tan and white and sooooo adorable.
i'll put the picture in here tomorrow or something.

that was a longer entry than planned.
so im going to bed.
theres a fucking cricket living in our kitchen.
behing the radiator.
and it might be good luck in china,
but in mckenzies house, its fucking annoying.

im going to the beach tomorrow 
and i have to get up early.
so gooodniiighhhtttt.
i've been trying to stop writing for like, 5 minutes but i keep thinking of things.

me and mom went to burlington coat factory tonight and i got some really cute cords and 3 shirts and a jacket. i still have a lot of school shopping to do tho.

"event","sooo um yesterday we got up and watched madison..that child is so freakin cute. but i feel bad for katelyn. if my mother had a kid when i was 14 and made me waste my summer babysitting her, i think i'd run away. anywho, we went to mcdonalds and i got a chocolate shake. yummy =P and we went to bed bath and beyond to return katelyns bag that she bought. that store has a ton of cool stuff that would go good in my room. im getting it painted green on sunday. its gonna be awesome. 

um.
then we went to the mall and walked around for a little while. we saw this girl that goes to katelyns school with another girl that this rap (lmao) was written about. apparently shes a major slut...

OK, this is how it goes
this ones for all my bitches and my hoes
runnin round the house in fitty percent clothes
It funny, seeing how much her belly grows

Thats right, she cut my heart with a saw
when i heard that the bitch was runnin round in her bra
i just laugh at the attention it draws
but do i give a shit, .....haha naw


Its ok, cookie dough takes its tolls
cause your shirt cant even cover your bottom jelly rolls
its not my fault your boobs are covered in moles
so just get out of school and go stick to the poles
                     (Stripper) 

haha thats the greatest thing i've ever heard. so anyways we saw them at hot topic and katelyn practically yelled ""MOM I NEED A NEW BRA!"" cuz the slutty one was prancing around in her bra at some kids house with a bunch of people around. nasty tramp. ha i dont even know her. 

buuut anyways..we went to spencers and katelyn bought a cute playboy bunny bag to hang on her wall. and i didnt bring my money because eventually i will need a car. so i suppose i should start saving for one. 

OH MAN. i was recently reminded that there is only 3 FLIPPING WEEKS left of summer vacation. wow. i kind of dont want to go back to school. concord high is like 189116574683 times bigger than mv. oh well. that means 189116574683 times more boys =P lol

k we're going to the movies tonight with a bunch of people to see the island? and i have to straighten my hair. and im starving. so im gonna go.

ciao

"event","wellll i never update bcuz im still computer-less. but hopefully it wont be for long bcuz jon just has to install a few drivers and then i get it back. however i have been saying such nonsense for quite a long time. so who knows when i'll really get it back. 

whats happening you ask? nada. i have a meeting to pick classes for this year on aug. 10th. and i've been babysitting cj this week. god hes lazy. and i have to babysit adrian and vinny (steve the ex-<3's little brothers) next week and the week after. that should be fun they're so cute. and um..i've given up on calling nate bcuz hes a stupid prick. and i've given up on conquering cody bcuz he may be hot but hes the equivelent of a piece of dirt. 

i have incredibly painful sunburns all over my body. back and front. thats what happens when you dont wear sunscreen. oh and there was a really hot guy (lifeguard!) checking me out as i was being fried so i wasnt too concerned with anything else. he talked to me and stuff. he was wicked cute in a scruffy beachy lifeguard way. and he was incredibly tall. 

well brittany is bitching at me to leave and i cant concentrate with her talking so im gonna go.

kisses and comments?

"event","well i dont click like legos with anyone right now but its cool. jackie has a wonderful new boy toy. lol. so i definitely havent updated in like FOREVER. but im getting my computer back sometime this week hopefully. so i guess i'll just tell you the basics of whats been going on. 

we moved into the new appartment! its like the size of 3 cardboard boxes but its like 10 feet away from anything i need..like stores and school and stuff. and im going to concord high next year if mom ever freaking gets me registered. but anyways..

so the whole nate thing..well its a long story and i dont feel like typing it all right now so the short version is he pretended to like me, i put out cuz im a friggin idiot, he lied about not telling cody (apparently he told him everything. they were quite good stoner buddies..jackass), anyways..then he went home cuz he was done housesitting..he swore he would call and pretended like he was sooooo into me and blah blah blah and JUST GUESS who hasnt called? or answered his phone when i call? you got it! NATE!! but whatever..he can poke himself in the eye for all i care. lol harsh i know.

umm..so the relationship with **** (if you can call it that) has gotten even more complicated. i really dont even like him but hes really hot. and we got stoned together the other day and he was like, can we go fuck now? and im like no you were an asshole before. and then he spent like 20 minutes trying to convince me to sleep with him. i'll let you guess what happened at the end. you can assume im a good girl or a slut. then later i ate like 2 packets of ramen noodles. haha.

sooo i dont know what else to speak about..oh yea i told brittany everything about nate. she didnt care. hypocrite. whatever. she was all omg im so glad you're happy! and then she was all..omg i cant believe he did that! but oh well shes lame. 

so yea. im single. and bored. but i LIKE IT! ok i dont really but if i convince myself i do maybe it will happen. 

gotta go im watching devon.
ciao.

*edit* i forgot to mention that kenzie dumped ben and i went to the beach with her and her cousin. it was wicked fun. kenzie and her (cute!)brother dragged me into the ocean with all my clothes on. lol. and we dug up clams that had penises. dont ask. =P k thats all buh bye."

"event","uh oh. i fucked up a lil bit. ok i guess i should start at the beginning since i havent updated in a while. not very many big things have really been going on except whats happening now. first of all, that hot kid that lives with nana for a little while, nate, well...brit made out with him. and the next day she got all serious and had to ""talk to him"" and she had to know ""what it meant"" and a whole bunch of stuff. so he said he was on E which, you should know, makes you horny. so he was embarrassed or whatever and he regretted it because he doesnt really like her. but she wont accept that and she still wants him. so he keeps like, ignoring her and not talking to her and staying in his room when we're there. but right now britt is in hawaii (lucky bitch lol) so i dont have anyone to go to nanas with so me and janel slept over there this weekend. and we were hanging out with nate and we were flirting and stuff and then everyone went to bed and we were still watching tv and we started making out! so now i feel like a horrible friend cuz it went a liiiiittle farther than just making out. just a little though. so now im hoping brittany never reads this. but anyways...me and him were talking and he was like, the whole thing with britt was a mistake and blah blah blah. and then i asked if he was high because a girl has to know these things especially after what he did to brittany. and he said no and i made him promise. so then we were just cuddling and hanging out and stuff and nana got up so we went to bed. omg this is so cute! he has a million freckles on his arms like me and he has a couple on his stomach and they are adorable. ok so  im a loser i admit it. but its still cute =P oh yea and the next morning he snuck in before anyone got up and he kissed me and it woke me up and we just layed there and talked for a little while and then janel got up and ruined it. freaking jerk. but you know how that goes. i dont know what to do about brittany..i mean i obviously cant tell her because she'll hate me for stealing her man...even though hes not her man and never was. but whatever that wont matter to her because i knew she liked him. god dammit why does she think she always can have the guy? its kind of stuck up of her. shes such a bitch sometimes. but oh well...its not a big deal. but i have to go even though there is more that i could talk about. bells gonna ring soon.

for kenzie to get out of practice. then mom picked us up and we went to concord 
high for the VOC tour to meet our teachers and stuff. kenzie's doing the nursing 
program so we went separate ways. but the marketing program seems pretty cool. 
we get to work at the store and maybe go to dallas for some convention thing at 
the end of the year. so after we met up with kenzie again shes going on and on 
about this hot guy thats in her class. he really was hot. and mom started 
freaking talking to his mom cuz they were walking behing us. lol kenzie was 
bright red. it was wicked funny. so shes in love now. but not with ben cuz hes a 
moron. no hitter..ew. dont ask. but anywho mom brought me and kenzie to see the 
appartment and its pretty sweet. my room is kind of small but the attic is huge 
and its almost all mine. mom just needs a little corner for storage and the rest 
can be my hangout spot. kenzie's spending memorial day weekend with me hopefully 
so we can clean up the attic and pimp it out. haha. its gonna be awesome. i cant 
wait to move now. well...i dunno. but anyways...<br>we went to connecticut for 
the weekend and i hung out with megan and dave. all they did was fight and make 
up. it was fun though.<br>umm..brianne and devon came over last night and we 
started cleaning the spare room upstairs. <br>i found some cool stuff for the 
attic...like my lava lamp and my vw bug lamp and some beads and shit. i 
dunno..we're gonna have to go shopping to find some cool stuff. but omg i packed 
up like, almost all of my room last night. almost all my shoes are packed and my 
cd cases and books and belts i dont wear and shit. my room looks way bigger. its 
crazy.<br>oh yea i just remembered we get yearbooks today! im so excited. but

"event","umm so i had an...interesting weekend.
me and brit went and played pool on friday night.
there was some guy there named gary and he was watching me and brittany suck ass at playing so he asked if we wanted to play with him.
he was reallllly hot.
so we said sure and we won bcuz he scratched on the 8 ball.
haha weird.

we slept over nanas friday cuz we were ""in town"" thats how mom put it anyways. and friday night was wicked fun. after we were at nanas for a while, we walked to the park at like 10 and sat on the basketball court in the dark and talked about stupid shit. then nana called britts cell and asked if we wanted to go to walmart with her so we made her bring us to mcdonalds and we seriously pigged out. then we walked around walmart to burn off some of those calories and a good song came on so me and brittany started singing...in the middle of walmart. it was so funny people were staring at us and laughing. but it was crazy. then we went home and brit left early saturday morning to go get her softball pictures done. and she went to a wedding .. i forget whos it was. and i basically chilled in my pjs all day. ahh so relaxing. i watched national treasure with brenda. good movie by the way. and then britt came back and i finally got dressed. we went and played pool again to see if there were any hot guys. there IS an advantage to being bad at pool. =P there wasnt anyone good there so we went and got chinese food. then nana picked us up and we went back to her house cuz mom was at the sting concert with jon. me and brit hung out with cody for a while and watched some stupid eddie murphy movie. then britt went to bed and me and cody hung out and watched viva la bam. they are such morons. then i went upstairs and went to bed. brenda lori and cody went to cody's dads for mothers day and mom brought brittany home. and i did nothing for the rest of the day.

28 days left of school!!

i ended up going to the track meet with brittany. and then to her softball game. it was really cold.
and i still cant get the image of cody in (short) track shorts out of my head.
im scarred for life. *shiver*
=P
umm..i saw aunt lori and brenda there. they're so devoted lol. and nate bought me pizza. and brittany lost her softball game miserably. 

ugh i was sick yesterday. i woke up and attempted to eat breakfast and then threw it up. 
tres nasty.
and i couldnt even stay home because stupid real estate lady was showing the house today.
so i ended up at nanas.. big surprise.
i really might as well just fucking move in.
and nana had to watch john and michael so it was loud and annoying. then cody came home with one of his friends and i was like, half asleep. and they decided they wanted to play guitar in the garage.
needless to say it was loud and i couldnt go to sleep. friggin boys. at least they played some good songs...or tried.
and then brittany came over and we went to the park. and we came back and the boys were sitting outside. just sitting. doing nothing. staring at us. so we walked back the other way and they started laughing really hard. morons.
aaand um..me and brittany watched making the band. p diddy is hot. and then we went to sleep.
mom picked us up at friggin 6:24 this morning. i know this bcuz brit was like, ""ahhh its only 6:24 we shouldnt be up yet!"" yea were losers. anyways...now im here and im supposed to be making up testing that i missed yesterday.

damn.

friggin comment.
say something interesting.

"event","soo last night was not a very fun night. i got home from school and layed on the trampoline for an hour in the sun. then i went inside and fell asleep cuz i was wicked tired..im still wicked tired. but anyways...mom and devon came home and devon made me get up. kenzie called and was locked out of her house lol. so we talked for a little while. then i went downstairs..mom asked me when the real estate lady came. and i said i dunno i was sleeping..apparently she put up a for sale sign in front of the house. mom was pissed but she was all bitchy to me about it like it was all my fucking fault. so she called the landlord and they talked and we have 30 days to get out. nice of them to spring it on us like this. before that we were supposed to have until june 1. whatever. kenzie and me were looking for appartments in mv but there are like, none. whatever im sick of my mother bitching about all the stress like i dont have any either. 

um..i have nothing else to say really

"event","soooo i think me and brittany cant be friends anymore. all we do is fight. like last night for example...we were in the car and candy shop came on and mom was like, change it. so i did cuz i didnt want to piss her off and i have the cd anyways. so then we get home and later brittany was like, wow your mom really didnt like that song huh? so i go i know right. and i laughed. and then all i said was your mom probably doesnt like it very much either. and she goes, no she likes it. so i said well if she had a choice thats probably not what shed pick. and britt got all defensive and bitchy and started flipping out saying i dont know her mom and i dont live with her 24/7 and i never come to her house and blah fucking blah. i cant take it anymore. we never get along. EVER. and i cant even tell her stuff anymore. i saw dylan the other day and i told her that and she almost had a heart attack and wouldnt talk to me for the rest of the night. its not like i slept with him again! jeez..then she complains that guys dont like her bcuz shes fat and ugly. is she jealous that i hang out with dylan? because she really shouldnt be..i mean hes hot and everything but hes no prince charming. whatever. she can sit all alone in her room and hang out with amy or whoever cuz i dont care. kenzie's a good best friend. at least she doesnt get mad at EVERY little thing i do. fucking whatever.
PLUS..all she cares about is herself. i gave her some of my cds so she could burn them for herself and i wanted some in return so i gave her some blank cds so she could copy some of hers. she copied my cds the first day she got them. and she hasnt even started mine. this was like a month ago that she got them. i finally got my cds back but she still hasnt copied even ONE of hers for me. and the plan was to do one of mine, one of hers, one of mine, one of hers..till they were all done. oh but nooooo..she has to be a selfish bitch and do everything for herself. oh and now her computer is supposedly broken so she cant do mine unless her dad lets her use his computer. whatever im getting my blank cds back cuz they will never get done. i guess i just need to save my money and buy my own damn cds. good thing she doesnt have to spend any of her precious money on cds. she has me at her disposal. not anymore. shes not getting anything from me anymore. not even her b-day present. i like it so im keeping it.

wow im kind of a bitch. whatever.

so anyways...last night mom took me and brittany ( this whole ""me hating brittany"" thing started last night ) to see a movie at the capital center. they were playing grease. i loooove that movie. its so great. brittany was dancing in her fucking seat. retard. and singing REALLY loud. and we were near people from our school..chelsea guy and all her gay friends. i was like, maybe you dont have to go to school with these people cuz you punked out and you're homeschooled but I DO...and you're seriously embarassing to bring into public. it was kinda fun though..im really tired tho.

so im gonna go.

this weekend was crazy.
thursday i slept at aunt maggies cuz i had a doctors appt. friday at dartmouth. 
friday i slept at nanas and megan, dave, brian, and gina came up and we hung out.
saturday i went shopping and sat in the SUN (finally getting nice out!!) with megan. aunt lisa had a party and bonfire and aunt lori and mom werent there long so i got to drink with megan. it was kind of weird. i didnt get like, falling down puking drunk, but it was fun. janel was a little shocked i think. whatever..then i slept at aunt lisas and megan and dave went home early sunday. i slept until 2 and finally got up and felt like crap. then me and janel hung out in the sun all day and nana brought us to the mall and i got new flip flops. janel got some really cute ones too. then we went to get my ears pierced cuz janel made me. ""cuz you wear your hair up all the time."" whatever. i got little ones with skulls on them. nana doesnt like them. lol and she had to pretend to be my legal gaurdian. shes a bad liar. haha whatever. so then we had d'angelos and went back to aunt lisa where mom rushed me out the door and home. brittany called and was supposed to sleep over cuz mom went out but shes a bitch and never called back. whatever. so i watched desperate housewives and went to bed. and now im here in hell..i mean school.

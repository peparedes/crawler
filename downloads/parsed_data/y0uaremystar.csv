OH YES. should i jump on the myspace bandwagon? its a good way to be vein (OH YES) and a great way to make yourself feel better about yourself. i guess? and its addicting. shall i?? or shadtn i? however you spelll itttt.






i was thinking today...and..woah..i ran away from home. how incredible is that. im so hardcore. well in my own world i am. i have NO phone. NO money. NO place to live. NO car. barley any clothes. and here i am, doing whatever i want. finally being happy. CHANGINGGG for the BETTER. im happy now. and im caring and NICE. i know me nice....weird huh. its really awesome. and im really happy about it.











oh yay. other things are going wonderfully today. i say today because i never really know how tomorow will be..ive learned to take things one day at a time. but for right now, i couldnt be happier. i literally couldnt sleep last night because i was so happy. or maybe i just couldnt sleep? nah..ill make it more exciting and say that i was way too happy to sleep. and i know that this can go as easily as it came..as quickly. so im not going to screw it up like i always do. this is it. this is prob the last chance. so no screw ups! im happy. im finally happy. things are going great.

funny how things have a weird way of sortof working out... hmm...






for the record... i AM grateful. more than anyone could ever know. i feel so lukcy to have people in my life like briana and like chantelle and like chelsea. and maybe i have a strange way of showing it, but i DO love yall. i mean..i used to beat up hayley, but she always knew i loved her. i really thought that this summer was going to be so awesome and that me and briana would finally be closer again and i could finally have chantelle and chelsea and erica back in my life..but everyone has someone else and to be completely honest, i havent felt like i fit in the whole time ive been here. which is why i sometimes want to venture off and go hang out w acotsa or bridget..bc thats where i feel like a person. you guys have all your inside jokes and stuff and i think its really awesome, but im not in on them and im not asking to be. my only goal here is to be here for anyone when they need me. IF they need me. when chantelle was crying, who danced in the backseat, made an ass out of herself, and sang a song about guacalomle until she laughed? me. who TRIES to help out briana when her and everyone else are fighting? me. ive tried my hardest to be here for you guys and to fit in. but somehow im always off. and im not sure how to fit in. im not sure how to be accepted by yall for all my flaws and faults. bc i know ive got them. but im willing to do anything, and i hope yall know that. i dont want to fight. i dont want someone yelling at me to go home. and i dont want anyone to think im ungrateful. bc that is the LAST thing i am. no one could ever imagine how LUCKY i feel to be here. to be at a home that was so much better than mine. and to be here with one of my friends so i can talk and laugh and cry around. its made me a happier person, definately. even kimbo noticed that. and im really not sure how else to make you guys know it, but i do love yall. and im not ungrateful at all. and yeah i am a bitch, and ill be the first to admit it. and im sorry. if someone would just say something when its happening, the problem would be solved. i dont know how else to fit in here..but do know that i am trying. and thats pretty much all i can do....

"event","alright, so as you all may have heard, i did run away from my house. and i ran to my aunts. and then i was unhappy there, so i ran away to hayleys house. and i will be staying here until briana comes back from cancun and then i will live in the boom boom backroom until school starts. and belive me.. there will be boom boom in that backroom. whhhat whhat. just kidding.



so there are many thingsss i feel like saying, but i dont feel like typing, or having the whole world know my business. but lets just say that my mom and aunt didnt have very nice things to say about me. how about caling me a compulsive liar. saying that i am just like my mom. and that i have problems and need to see someone. and pretty much every other degrating and mean thing. so they have me really thinking about what kind of a person i am and everything and its not good. my mom even made this comment that has been repeating in my head and i think that it is true.. she said: no one or nothing will ever make you happy. is this true? i dont know...:( i cant decide... i hope that shes wrong.. but theres a little part of me that thinks shes right.




with this new separation anxiety ive been having..i realized a lot of things. i realized how much my brothers and my sister meant to me. i guess i sort of started to resent them or something and i wish i hadnt. and now when i see them its like ... i dont know. im overfiled with love for them. they really are the most amazing things i have in my life. and i think that if i ever found happiness...it could possibly be in them. they are the most amazing things i have ever seen. and i dont know..... i also miss someone else. and everyone knows i miss him. he knows i miss him. and i havent talked to him in a long time and i dont know if its good or bad. i know im going to break down and talk to him but im not sure if thats good. i dont know. i want to be happy. and he makes me happy. but i dont know... i really dont.. im still tryng to figure things out.





so pretty much... im trying to find ... myself. which is really lame and is really cliche or something i dont know. but i need ot figure out shit about myself bc its true what everyones been saying... i am this little secluded person with no hope for life. and it is true that i cant get anywhere in life being the way i am. so i need some serious life changing going on, or i really am going nowhere. it doesnt pay being a bitch to everyone around me it really doesnt. it isnt fufilling to be someones secret. and it doesnt pay to steal someone away from someone..bc i cant ever really have them. i dont know, i know that the things i do are wrong i know ive done a lot of wrong in my life. and i need to try to change somehting about myself..bc apparently its not working.






now i have to get a job and support myself. and i wonder why i even ran away now.. so UGH.

one more day of school. is it even possible to SURVIVE? i dont know i dont know. my last exams are EASYYYYYY too..so thats always good.







i am not starting to realize how fucked up people really are. not to say that i dont do or say fucked up things..but some people are fucking terrible. and i think it sucks how they make others feel. no one deserves to feel the way that these people make them feel. why do you feel the need to USE everyone for your own benefit? havent you ever heard of FRIENDSHIP? im almost kind of sad to say that i assosiate with people like this..but i do. and sadly, ive been one of those people. but im done with that. thats fucked up. no one deserves to be friendless..no matter how much shit they do. no matter how many times they backstab you. everyone deserves atleast ONE fucking friend they can rely on. and the sad part is.. its only going to get worse as the years go by.. and im sorry about that. im sorry for you. i really am.

and all thats left is a fucking letter that you know you read everyday. inside it tells how much i care and how much it hurts that youve gone away. but you never once said that it touched your heart and brought back to life what once was dead. what i meant to write is that i fucking love you. but beautiful, don't let it go to your head...







and the only way i belong to you
is if we keep perfectly quiet.
in the darkest of nights
and the latest hours
you secretly agree to see me
and each time the slick encounters arise,
i feel the noose getting tighter.
most days i need something else
to get my mind off of you.
so i fall asleep on the living room floor
holding tight to two bottles.
one makes me numb to the feelings i have for you
one makes it almost impossible to stop thinking of you.
so in a way they counteract
and leave me desperately clutching to the phone
in hopes that for some odd reason your shallow mind
stopped a second just to think of me.
and when i rise with the sun
my heart starts to beat fast
i check the phone, in hopes of you calling
but it is always the same...
the pills still arent working,
i'm still thinking about you,
you neve even thought of calling.
so add another tally under big bold letters:
""you let me down again...""

"event","so today was the seniors last day. i miss them already. i cant even imagine what life is going to be like without them. but i do know that all the drama has finally subsided. yay! i pretty much settled everything with everyone. i told lancie i was sorry for all that happened.. i gave eric a hug..told tracy sorry.. apologized to alana for the drama we had in the beg of the year.. etc. and i gave chelsea briana chantelle christopher and alyss letters. you know, my infamous senior letters. uh huh! well i didnt give it to chris. i had to get someone else to do it. isnt that a shame. no comment.


all i can say is that most of oh five were MY LIFE. ive spent three years doing everything with these people.. from prom to weekends to baseball games to everything! and now.. they are gone. poof. done. its rather depressing. and im stuck here at a school where my class hates me and shit. oh wonderful. oh girls and boys please come back. i need you guys!! :(



things are finally going to be okay tho! i wont have to throw up every three seconds bc i see them together. and i wont ever have to worry about them making me sad or anything. things are okay. i said what i needed to say to him and it wouldnt even surprise me if we never spoke again. oh well. im over it i suppose.




i miss you guys!! :'("

"event","i'm sorry about the phone call and needing you
some decisions you don't make
i guess its just like breathing and not wanting to
there's some things you can't fake.
and i'm sorry about the phone call and waking you
i know that it is late
but thank you for talking because i needed to
some things just can't wait...



now i am starting to see that i really can't have anything great happen to me because i am so stuck worrying about other, less important things. and i can't allow myself to enjoy anything because frankly.. what's the point? nothing is worth anything unless it is you. when i'm laughing, i'm not really happy. when i smile, i'm not really all there. i don't know. its all really strange. and this hasn't ever happened before. usually i can bounce back, or return to normal or something.. but this time i can't. and how could i ever get around to telling him that he's everything? oh yeah i forgot.. i'm not. some things are better left unsaid. so i am sorry about the phone call and needing you. it just sort of gives me hope. when you answer, it gives me hope. i don't know what else to do or where to go or anything. all i know is that i don't want you to go. but i know that there isn't anything i can do about it. oh well.



moms is gone. and it is 3 and i am home. what is that? NO ONE could/would do anything with me tonight. its ridiculous. every single time i can go out.. no one else can. i swear the whole world is out to get me. i swear on everything it is. its really not fair at all. i'm oh so devestated. and no one EVER calls me to hang out. i don't understand. am i really not that cool to hang out with? hmph. you learn something new everyday i suppose.






and tonight, i pass out on the floor
clinging to the phone
in hopes that it will ring
and you'll be on the other line.
i am staring at the clock
waiting for 11:11
so that i can close my eyes
and wish that you were mine...




i love you. don't you understand?"

so i like my icon. a lot like love. i wish i could find someone who was perfect for me in everyway. why doesn't exciting things happen to me like that?!!!! BLAH. who cares. i really don't want a relationship! i promise. i don't even want a guy in my life. i promise. it's way too much drama!! speaking of drama.... fergie and me are okay again. i'm so happy. i really need him in my life. i'm really glad. he's so awesome. i love hiiim!!!! he's incredible! yay.



i always catch the clock, it's 11:11     //.





i don't belive in anything anymore.. BRAD and JEN didn't make it.. and now my KENNY CHESNEY is married?! never. life is over. life is UNFAAIIRR!! ugh!







i swear, 2 days and i will be okay.






would you look at her as she looks at me
she's got me thinking about her constantly
but she don't know how i feel
yeah, she carries on without a doubt
i wonder if she's figured out
i'm crazy for this girl.
yeah i'm crazy for this girl
   AWWWW> OLD SCHOOL SHIT.

"event","<P>All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right<BR>I'm tripping on words<BR>You've got my head spinning<BR>I don't know where to go from here</P>
<P>Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do<BR>Nothing to prove<BR>And it's you and me and all of the people<BR>And <U><STRONG>I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you</STRONG></U></P>
<P>There's something about you now<BR>I can't quite figure out<BR>Everything he does is <STRONG>beautiful<BR></STRONG>Everything he does is right</P>
<P><BR>kinda makes me wish i had a guy. or someone to even sing this about. there isnt anyone who does everything right or beautifully. sad huh? no not really. i am perfectly content. well i do have someone that i can't keep my eyes off of. but we won't really go there.</P>
<P><BR>due to the demands of the population... aka gretch and acosta...i am trying this whole journal thing again. i don't see the need to make it friends only, because i haven't anything juicy or full of gossip to write YET. when that does happen i'm sure it will be friends only again. or perhaps if i feel like making a friends only banner then i will. </P>
<P><BR>so my favoritest people only have like 3 days left. this is so saddening to me! and i wish people werent up other people's asses so that i could atleast be FRIENDS with them before they leave. but thats just wishful thinking or something. SEEING YOU, IT KILLS ME NOW.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>so prom? i guess i'm just not going to go now since everyone's going to ERIC DILLS. yeah too bad eric hates me and wont even speak to me/look at me. which breaks my heart, hes such an awesome kid. and i tried so hard for him to be my friend too. oh well. its for the best. and briana is going to everything along with fredy, which is fine.. but ERIC DOESNT LIKE ME. so i dont know! it doesnt even make sense for me to go if i have no one to hang out with or if everyone gets split up. thats so depressing! i go to prom to be with everyone.. yet everyone sells everyone else out. not even cool guys. not even cool. yall are so pulling an oh six on each other! never!! oh well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>so i started writing senior letters and stuff. it always depresses me so much to do that! but now more than ever. i feel like my life is going to go on hiatus! in fact, i KNOW it's going to go on hiatus!! :\ i finished the saddest of my letters.. it was hard, but also easy? i got to express everything, so it was okay i suppose. i just dont know when to give it to that person. they always seem to have a shadow. cant get them alone for even three minutes! so who knows!? blaaaahh. oh well. thanks chelsea (chalesseah) for coming over to watch one tree hill with me last night! (worst episode ever!!!!!!)</P>

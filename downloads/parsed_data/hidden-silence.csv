"event","<P>It's almost time for me to move across the state. I've been moving my things bit by bit, and taking real baby steps. I planned for it that way. I've never lived with someone I was romantically involved with.. neither has he. We both need time and baby steps. Our relationship isn't perfect. I don't think there IS such a thing... even if it was perfect.. that would make it abnormal.. which in turns.. makes it.. imperfect. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If that isn't a brain whirl, I don't know what is.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm feeling a great many things. Not only about this. Not about going back to school. Not about wanting to change majors already. Not the fact that I wasn't invited to go to the bar with my best friend and her ""housemates"" on her 21'st birthday..... My family. More so my father. I was a daddy's girl... until about 5. Then I became rebellious. I'm of course, joking. My father has been slowly but surely losing his sanity. I really noticed it (meerly from a childs perspective) when my grandmother (his mother) went into a nursing home... several at that. She died in April of 2001. It's then when it became apparent to everyone that dad wasn't quite the same. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Only latly it's been more severe. The rest of the family all went on a little weekend trip. My boyfriend even came and we all had a great time. My sister and I got off of an amazing ride we waited all weekend to ride... when we noticed our mom on her cell phone with a look of stress upon her face. It was then when we found out that my father fell asleep at the wheel and crashed, head on, to another car. He went to the hospital but was home within hours. He's fine, but has been playing it off as a joke... he dosen't seem worried about losing his lisense, a lawsuit, if the woman was even HURT. Nothing seems to matter to him. It's like it didn't even happen. He acted like his totaled, smashed car was a prize.. I was wondering if he was going to try to get it mounted on the wall or something. He was even talking about getting a new car which is rediculous as my parents have no money. I can't even ask to borrow some from them. He's being completly unrealistic and it's driving my mother insane. I've been stopping by every day just to add to the sanity in the house (not to say I'm much better). As I walked in the front door now.. I walked in to see my father in his underwear.. rocking in his chair. He thought I was my mother and didn't realize&nbsp;I wasn't&nbsp;for a good minute. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It's kind of hard to see and watch sometimes. In a way I feel bad for leaving now.. it's such a bad time. But my mother wants me to go.. and I am. </P>

<P>My head will deffinatly be turned to look behind for a good while.</P>

""Brick""

My own story in parenthesis




6 am day after Christmas (5 p.m week of her birthday)
I throw some clothes on in the dark 
The smell of cold (the smell of rain)
Car seat is freezing (pavement is steaming)
The world is sleeping (the world is driving)
I am numb

Up the stairs to the apartment (Drive through town, get lost on the way)
She is balled up on the couch ( he is late, but soon finds her)
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte (parents living their own lives)
They're not home to find us out (clueless to our day)
And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

They call her name at 7:30
I pace around the parking lot (he paces reception office)
Then I walk down to buy her flowers (she comes out, he grabs her hand)
And sell some gifts that I got (he holds her hand, tells her he loves her)
Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

As weeks went by
It showed that she was not fine
They told me son, it's time to tell the truth
She broke down, and I broke down
Cause I was tired of lying

Driving home to her apartment (driving home to our apartment)
For a moment we're alone
Yeah she's alone
I'm alone
Now I know it

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly



been a wonderful week. A lot of hard things I've had to go through. A lot of decisions. A lot of uncertainty. a lot of emptyness... sadness... and the all around feeling of being lost. 

This song is on loop


I am sick."

"event","<P>Again it's been a long time since my last update, and for that I apologize. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>An amazing amount has changed in my life since my last entry. I wasn't quite sure how to deal with things after my grampa died. Things just got crazy and I began to change.I can't remember everything now, and I'm not going to try. But I will try to sum up some open ends.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That last boyfriend was one of the easiest things I've ever gotten over. It wasn't hard in any way shape or form. He was self centered, closed minded, and lacked imagination and had no control over his life. We've spoken a small number of times, but nothing recently.</P>
<P>Because of the breakup and my grandfather's death, I began to realize that life is not necesarilly short.. but it needs to be lived to the fullest extent. Living life with regrets is not a life I want to have. I was sick of work everyday for 10 or more hours for crappy pay, I was sick of being screwed and shafted and abandoned. I didn't want to spend all my days inside working. I never wanted to live a life based on money and making sure I have enough. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So I took a risk. I went out with someone. Someone I misjudged. I then began to like him more and more.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lots of in between stuff I can't get into right now.. and two 1/2&nbsp;months later, I'm going to go back to school, with a major, get a new job and move. I'm going to a school in his town. Not because that's where he lives but because it's one of the best schools in the country. Well.. Not.. School... but.. well.. whatever. They have a great program for what I want. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm really excited but I'm also really fuckin scared. I can't screw this up.. if I do I'll just... be so discouraged! But I'll be ok...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>as long as I sleep tonight...</P>"

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm a little bit sad. I'm going to miss a lot about him.. but then again.. there's a lot I won't miss.

"event","<P>I get so fed up sometimes. I'm feeling ok right now. I am rather tired.. and depressed as always.. of course.. like that could ever stop. I'm tired of people pretending to care. Especially if it's for their benefit. If they only do it to make themselves feel better about who they are.. not for the sake of helping. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I've been staying up to all hours of the night. I had a breakdown. A good old fashioned breakdown 3 nights ago. I collapsed onto my bed.. curled up into a ball and began to bawl.. harder and harder. It was then when I gave in. I saved my wrists. I went for my stomach, and my sides. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Maybe it's because of Halloween.. maybe it's that <STRONG>deep</STRONG> <FONT color=#cc0000>red</FONT> almost <FONT color=#993399>purple</FONT> nail polish I dropped all over myself as blood... maybe it's because of a story someone told me. Maybe it's because I'm sick of people not beleiving me when I say 'I can't handle being used anymore'... maybe now.. guys who say they're interested in me.. will stop when they see..... maybe then they'll... I don't know. I don't know why I did it. But I know I did it again the next morning when I woke up.. and then again after I took a shower.. and later that night before I went out... </P>
<P>And.. it was.. I don't know. I didn't really.. care for people to know about it. But some found out. It hurt too bad... whenever someone hugged me I would cringe.. when someone would tickle me.. I'd shreik... and push them away... they didn't get it unless I told them that there were gashes there. I tried. I told them my stomach hurt... I told them... I have boo boo's... </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I saw a picture of his girlfriend. They were entangled in a hug. She was beautiful... tall.. skinny.. long.. straight hair....</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>she sounds really sweet too.. I don't blame him for being with her... I'm sure she's amazing.</P>

<P>Things are going alright. I'm over those fellas. They're not worth my time. I'm fine to be friends. Though, mr.original can't even really be that. It really is his loss. I'm awesome and I made him laugh a lot. I really don't think people laugh enough... What are ya going to do though?</P>
<P>I have a slight improv job. For halloween. My eyes have wandered toward another actor. I feel his may have met mine a few times. Either he likes me.. or.. is an amazing actor.. If I don't say anything I won't see him again after this weekend. So tomorrow when we're all getting dressed, I'm going to see if he'll hang out with me on Sunday night maybe.

<P>I finished a painting yesterday. It felt really good. It really did. I felt a big sense of accomplishment as I always do. I had been working on it for a while now.. so I'm glad I got it done. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I got my seasonal christmas job back. It's only for a few months but it will deffinatly help me stay focused on getting something better, and more permanent. Like waitressing. I think that would be a good skill to have. Especially if I'm now considering a move to NYC. I really think the creative side of me will come out there. I went to visit a while ago and I sat in an empty apartment for hours, listening to piano music, and writing poetry. Poetry I still read and enjoy now. And maybe then I won't be annonymous to you all. Though I think it would still be fun to have this. I think I'm getting ahead of myself.</P>

"event","<P>So the other night I was fed up. The new guy.. is driving me up the wall. Again he says he wants only my friendship and we can't do the ""<FONT color=#cc0000>bed thing</FONT>"". He's never done the casual relationship and dosen't want to start. Though he realized he led me on. He wanted to set it right. So we went to a movie. It was decent. Not the best ever. But whatever! We then went to his apartment to catch the <FONT color=#3333ff>yankees</FONT> game. Started out ok. I was on the couch, he was in the recliner... </P>
<P>....for all of 1 minute. </P>
<P>Then he asks me to rub his shoulders. So I do. Then he rubs mine, I rub his.. we go back and forth throughout the game. He then begins to make out with me and.. I didn't exactly fight it. But when he wanted to go farther I told him to <FONT color=#ff0000>stop</FONT> and to think. I didn't want him calling me the next day saying he regretted it and <EM><FONT size=2>bla bla bla</FONT></EM>. He said ""<EM>Yes. You're absolutly right</EM>"" So I was like ok. a few minutes later he goes again. I stop him again. repeat. finally I couldn't take it anymore. <I><FONT size=1>ba da bing</FONT></I> Still no sex. Don't worry. We don't want that. Neither one of us wants that. <FONT color=#3366ff>Yankees</FONT> lost. We were <STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffff00>pissed</FONT></EM></STRONG>. We left. no hug, no kiss, no handshake, no wave... barely a good bye. dah. You would think I'd be used to this. He's gone for another week. I think he has one more week trip.. NEXT week, then he's done. But I guess this weekend is still on for me, him, his daughter, and the <FONT color=#ff0000>c</FONT><FONT color=#ff9900>a</FONT><FONT color=#33cc00>r</FONT><FONT color=#33ccff>e</FONT> <FONT color=#cc33cc>b</FONT><FONT color=#ffcccc>e</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>a</FONT><FONT color=#6666cc>r</FONT><FONT color=#33ff33>s</FONT>. We'll see what happens there. Anyways. </P>
<P>My mother made me call to try and get unemployment. I knew I wouldn't be able to get it but she made me call anyway. Just like everyone said the Temp Agency would work.. I was correct in saying it wouldn't work. I'm broke. And I've been hating life more and more latly. I took a <STRONG><EM><FONT color=#cc0000>knife</FONT></EM></STRONG> to bed with me the other night. I didn't use it. It's still there. I did come close however. I'm a bit rusty. It's been over a year. Meh.</P>
<P>I think I'm going insane. I beleive I have <FONT color=#cccccc size=2><EM>ghosts</EM> <FONT color=#000000 size=3>in my room. It's a good thing this is an annoymous journal. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I have reason to beleive.. my ghosts are my 2 dead friends. There. I said it. All that's lacking from my story is a straight jacket. But.. whatever... I didn't cut. I think whatever story I have is good enough.. being the outcome is no <FONT color=#ff0000>blood.</FONT></P>
<P>But yeah right now I'm ok. Though today I'm just kind of sitting around in my pajamas and a sweatshirt. Which is more than I did yesterday. I did this.. and took a nap. Watched the <FONT color=#3333ff>Yanks </FONT>by myself without a beer.</P>

I don't know about that, but I am taking up his offer to hang out with him and his daughter next weekend. I may see him tomorrow as well. But next weekend he asked if I wanted to bring over some care bear movies to watch with his daughter, then play on the playground. I'm excited. I love kids, I love care bears, I love playgrounds... and I enjoy her father's company. ha.


I'm basically jobless now. I need to work on my resume'. I don't know how to do one. I'm finding things here and there but I know I'll have some trouble with it. All of these people keep telling me they're going to help when I know they just say that to be nice. But it's ok. There's a job I might get. But as I said I need a resume'. 


I talked to my origianl him. He.. didn't say much. He said he turned his ringer off to relax and be in silence. I'm almost positive there's something he dosen't want to tell me. Though, hey maybe I'm just paranoid. I don't have a reason not to be.. so.. n'yeah.


I'm doing a Halloween, improv thing. Despite all the shitty stuff that has been going on, this whole thing just lifts my spirits. I've been working on my costume, figuring out my make up, doing research on-line.. I feel a bit dorky but I'm really looking foward to it. I've done it before. Last year I was stuck inside. I was a charater who didn't talk and was stuck behind a wall. But this year, I'm outside, I can walk around, dance, talk, and actually play with the kids. I'm really looking foward to it.

"event","I had a good day yesterday. I saw some friends whom I don't get to see too often. I've been taking advantage of having the weekend off. 

I went out last night. I guess it was kind of a date. I hadn't met him before, but we've been talking for a while. We went to play pool. We took control of the juke box, and it took us an exceedinly long time to finish one single game. We played 3 or 4 games. Then a round of darts which also took a long time. Before I knew it, it was 1:30 and we decided to go watch our shared love ""The Simpsons"" at his apartment. He was nervous about inviting me over because he didn't want me to think anything was planned. I didn't care. I thought we were getting along great and didn't want to leave. So we went.

We took the thruway. When I got to the toll booth, my fare was already paid by the gentlemen in front of me. It was only a quarter, but I thought it was sweet anyways. 

I was surprsed by his apartment. It wasn't the bachelor pad I'm used to going to. It was nicely done, neat and clean. He showed me around and we got settled. 


I ended up staying the night. We didn't sleep together. There was some fooling around but deffinatly high school level. He was so.. affectionate. He would randomly squeeze me, or kiss my hair, or my face... Even through the night. And I actually slept. I fell asleep... just after him. 


He sang in the shower this morning. Then he took me to breakfast. He's going out of state for a week now, of course for work. It didn't seem like a one time thing.. and I hope he... I don't know. 



We'll see how this goes. I know I could like him, and at this point, I could walk away from this too. Though.. maybe I don't want to.. I'm going to.. just.. be myself and hope something comes out of it."

Just to see if I call this, I'm going to write it down.

My prediction, is that right before the rehersal he's going to say he feels ok enough to drive an hour to reherse. Then.. tomorrow.. right before the wedding (right before so I have no time to get there.. it IS a 3 hour drive..) I.. have a feeling something like that is going to happen.


He's making it extremly easy to move on from him. I feel like he's trying to erase himself from me or something. We never ever talk. It's not even how it was when we first met. He never answers his phone. 

I'm slowly begining to not care. I'm slowly begining to realize that I can find someone who dosen't live 3 hours away. I can find someone who actually cares to see me. Someone who dosen't sleep with me.. and then decides we moved too fast and can't be together....


I'm pretty sure I can find someone else."

"event","So. I've been trying very hard to get him out of my head. But it just won't work. I can't seem to get around it..

The biggest thing is that, it dosen't seem to be bothering him at all. He dosen't miss me. He dosen't think of me. He dosen't lay in bed at night wondering if I'm missing him, and he dosen't reach for me. He dosen't even realzie I was there. I almost feel as if he forgot he even met me in the first place.

I've been trying to be cold. Trying not to care. Trying to go off and find other guys who at least pretend to want me... 

I suppose I would be out finding someone new right now, if it wansn't for a slight.. woman problem, which I'm releived to have. This him who doesn't care, hasn't stopped that for me. 


My head hurts. Not as bad as my heart. 



I walk around barefoot. All the time. I go outside and wander about the yard, and the sidewalk and driveway. Sometimes the pavement is hard and sharp and I have to jump to the soft grass. My feet are always grey, and have some sort of cut or scratch. I don't care. 

It's supposed to snow soon. I'll have to wear sneakers and boots instead of sandles.


Last night I made a list. I've been with nine men. <i>Nine</i>. That's a lot, and I was ashamed. Though.. not all of them were wanted, or had my permission... but that dosen't bring the number down. I know now that I'm always going to be looked down upon when I meet someone knew. The inevitable question will always surface, and, I guess I don't look the part. 

I'm 20. I'm 5'3''. I'm 160 ish. I have a stupid looking face with a hereditary bump in my nose making me look like a fucking witch, and I bite my nails and have dirty feet! I mean.. I'm not.. your typical.. ""slut"". I've never dyed my hair, it hasn't even b een cut or anything in over 5 years... I have no fashion sense, and.. I'm extremly unstable. But.. I have a big heart, an open mind, and I'm trusting...

I went to see him and his band compete last night. I was going to pour my heart out to him, and tell him I was ready and willing to be with him, and that I wouldn't have it any other way.


He was.. maybe.. distant. His mind was elsewhere. I talked to his students more than I talked to him. I TRIED to talk to him. To no avail.. I grew confused.

I thought we were going to go grab a bite to eat. It was still early and we hadn't had the chance to see or talk much in the past week. But he said he simply wanted to go home and get his mind off things. 

Hurt, and confused I reluctantly walked to my car, and watched him screetch his tires and speed away. 



What had I done? It couldn't have been something I said... I didn't <i>say</i> anything. I knew he was upset about the judges... but I knew there was something deeper. 


As I started driving and he faded farther and farther away from me, I just began to cry. Slowly at first. As the minutes passed I grew hysterical. Who had I to call? Who could I go to or talk to? My best friend? Who was throwing a party I wasn't invited to? He was the only one I could go to... and yet.. I didn't know if that was right or wrong. With all of my thoughts latly, I decided that I needed him to know what I've been thinking. 

I told him everything. I told him I was going to open up and that I was ready to be with him. It's the only thing that makes sense to me. I talked and talked for ahwat seemed like hours. Then it was his turn...

He basically said that he dosen't have time for himself, let alone.. time for a relationship. He also said that, it scared him to think that I depend on him. Yes. The exact same thing my ex boyfriend said to me on numerous occations. That is the part that stung the most. 

Especially since he was always the one to get me to talk. He got me in the habit of telling him what was on my mind, and that I could go to him whenever I felt the need... whenever... it.. didn't matter..

My heart was just breaking. I didn't understand. I didn't want to. I wanted to pretend nothing was happening... I wanted to pretend things were how they were before...


He told me to write him a letter. So I went home and I did. I started to feel better, and I went off to sleep... only to have nightmares. He was in every one... But one was ok... 

I dreamed I gave him the letter and he realized that he had made a mistake.. then we were walking around and he kept introducing me as his girlfriend, and holding my hand, and keeping his hand on my back.. and.. I was wondering how I was ever worried...

I feel like absolut shit. The low of low's.

I was on-line as usual, and just.... wanted someone to talk to, maybe, to go somewhere, do something. But as usual everyone was too busy for little me. No one could even spend two seconds telling me that they couldn't do anything.


My best friend. I love her to pieces. Our friendship goes back 9 years. We've been through so much and sometimes I wonder how we're still friends. It's hard to explain what she's done. Though I can't hold her to it becasue she didn't realize it. ANd she's sorry now. But the things I've done without thinking. Such as, sleeping with her ex. In fact, I thought he got me pregnant. I told her about it. She was, extremly upset. More upset than I had really seen her. She took a little time to herself and was ok. She even came with me to buy a pregnancy test. We both laughed and sigh'ed a HUGE sgh of releif when I started laughing. 

"".. No fucking WAY!!!!!""
"".. What!?! WHAT!!!!!???""

"".. I got my fucking PERIOD!""


heh. That's the way our friendship is. Everything is just, halarious. But it's hard. She goes to school at the big university here. I'm so glad. She's 10 minutes away. But.. her mindset is that she's ""away"" at college. That took me a while to really.. get. She has her friends there. But it isn't the easiest thing to see her. She's a busy girl. She has school, she works, one of those alone would make a person busy. But she's doing both. Her birthday was at the end of August. Last night I still had her presents. I decided to wrap them up and drop them off at her house.


I had been scared to give them to her. Well, one thing. I wrapped up a book she let me borrow a while ago, and I made her a big Mix CD of songs we've always loved. Songs from Middle school, high school, and what we love now. For some reason I was able to fit like, 6 hours of music onto a CD... I found that as an added bonus. The thing I was afraid of, was a painting. I painted it for her. But, when it was finished, I wasn't sure if she would like it. I didn't want her to pretend. But then, I knew she would if I was there. 

I knew she was inside doing work. So I made a plan. My plan was to go leave it on her porch, get back into my car, beep twice, then send her a text message saying ""BEEP BEEP! Go to the porch. Happy 20""

I thought it was insanly clever. 

I pulled up and of course, She was walking outside with one of her housemates. 

DAMNIT!

I told her what I had planned and that, I didn't care if she didn't like it but I didn't want to be there when she opened it. I handed it to her, and we said good bye. She called a bit later asking ""How could you think I wouldn't like something you made?""

I was.. actually speachless. She loved it! SHe said she was staring at it trying to find all of the hidden things in there. SHe was also very excited about the CD. Especially when she realized there were 5 pages of songs..


I love her. I honestly do. I miss her too though.. almost mroe than I love her.

"event","I'm feeling very alone, and lost latly. Maybe I have right to be, maybe I don't. I can't tell anymore. I'm so used to me feeling this way without reason, I'm never sure if it changes. 

The feeling itself is never old. Everytime I'm down it feels like it's the lowest I've felt.

<i>""Every day is a little bit worse than the day before.. Everyday, is the worst day of my life""</i>

Some day I don't feel a need to get up and do something. I do anyway. I set an alarm and get myself up, dressed, and go somewhere. Be it to take pictures, or pay bills, or go to a mall, a store, anywhere. Just to get out and do SOMEthing. Because I know, if I sit in my pajamas all day, watching tv, playing on this damn computer, I know I'm going to hate everything about myself by the end of the day. I usually do anyway, but it's only worse if I have nothing to show for an entire day.

Sometimes I think that maybe I shouldn't have broken up with my boyfriend. I wasn't exactly.. happy and I knew that we weren't right for eachother, but, he never allowed me to feel this way. At first I could but then he got tired of it. We would be in bed at night and I would cry, he wouldn't pay any attention to me. I would cry harder because he didn't care. But then I didn't want to keep him awake so I just quieted myself. But, now that we aren't together.. he's been doing the things he knows I love. He's been listening and trying to be there for me. But, I just. I beleive he's only doing that so I think I was wrong and would come crawling back to him. He did kiss me after. But that might have just been because, it's been so long. 


But something out there tells me that.. there IS someone better for each of us out there. Maybe I've found him already, I'm really not sure. That would make things a lot easier. In some ways I guess.




I want so much. I want to.. I want to be one of the girls. No one thinks of me as that. Everyone thinks I'm someone else. I may not be the girliest person in the world. I don't get my nails done or dye my hair... I don't really like shopping... But I like kitties, and puppies, and babies... I like pink.. and.. singing and dancing. 

I fit in more with guys than girls. I notice that. A lot of my friends are older and married. When we all get together, the wives and women are in one room talking, and gossiping... I'm in the other room with the men watching family guy, and laughing about how women talk so much and have to go to the bathroom in pairs. 


There's a part of me that just.. Maybe if I had gone to college. But I just, I can't see myself on a campus. I can't see myself trying to fit in with people, and trying to find my ""group"" of friends. People would try to be nice but, I can see through all that.



<i>How am I supposed to find myself?





How am I supposed to go anywhere...</i>

"event","I think I may be getting a bit sick. That wouldn't exactly surprise me. My darling ""him"" has something, so does my mother. Also a few people I work with have come down with things. I'm not sure if I'm completly dreading being sick. 

I did end up painting last night. I got myself some new brushes, and some bigger canvas. I'm enjoying how my painting is coming out. If it turns out as good as I hope it does, I want to give it to 'him'. 

What I would love. I'm not saying anytime soon, but, I would love for us to marry. I would love to decorate our home. Spread my paintings around our house... walk around from room to room, and sing. Watch him conduct as he eats his dinner and thinks. Look to the window and see my cat gazing out... answer the door to students stopping by for a quick visit to say hello, and ask if they can see the car he's working on... 

<i>""you can say, that I'm a dreamer""</i>



.. And I guess I really am. It's very early in our relationship. I know this. 



We're going to a wedding in two weeks. I get to spend the entire weekend with him. We get to dress up, and dance, and I get to meet all of his friends. 



This weekend will be fun as it is.."

"event","I've been feeling rather lost today. I haven't done too much. Today is one of those days that don't come around much. Today was a day I didn't have to go to work. Needless to say I spent the day working around here. 


Latly I've been feeling as if I live in a nursing home. My parent's don't take care of themselves. My mom dosen't because she's busy taking care of her parents and working. My dad, however, needs help tying his shoes, and getting shirts over his head. It even smells like a hospital. And I hate it.


My good friend/semi cousin called me today. I haven't talked to him much since he moved in with a new family. I wish.. with everything I have... that I could take him, and he could live with me, and go to the high school he wants to go to, and go to a college he wants to go to,  and work where he wants to, and, go out and be happy and have friends again. He calls me for a few minutes every couple of days to talk to me before anyone gets home. 

I am touched that he choses to call ME. Even though we're cousins, I still love him like a brother. I wish I could do more for him. When I move on and find a decent job where I can take care of myself, I'm going to try my hardest for him to live with me and my cat. Yes. I love my cat. You would too. Even if you don't like cats... you would like <i>my</i>cat. 


I've been trying to remember what makes me enjoy life more. Today as I cleaned, I put a CD on. I sang. I always sound good when I'm mad, or upset. I also lit some candles and hung some art. I think I'm going to go to the store today and buy more canvas. I feel like painting tonight I think. 


I think I'd like some yellow paint. I really think I would. 



I'm concerned. I've been shaking a lot latly again. I feel like Ozzy. I eat enough. I drink enough. Maybe it's not an even balance. Maybe I don't sleep enough. It seems like there's just way too much people have to do to be ""Healthy"". Eat like, 8 servings of fruits/vegetables, drink 47 glasses of water, run 26 miles, eat a cookie, and get 8 hours of sleep, every day. On top of working/raising children/having any sort of social life.

::sigh::


Does anyone honestly do that? Low Carbs, Cholesterol, heart, arteries, brain, there's so much stuff out there to make people paranoid. I bet it's all just a coverup. No one has time to worry about conspiracies... All too busy trying to be ""healthy""..."

"event","As much as I've been trying to fight it. Or.. at least postpone it... I can't...


I'm falling for him. When we talk it's amazing. When we're together.. there aren't words to explain my happiness.... when we're a part.. I miss him.. with every part of me. 


I hate that I've turned into the kind of girl that only talks about the ""him"" in her life. But I really just can't do anything without thinking about my ""him""!


It's not that I don't want to be with him. I do. I reallly <i>reallllly</i> do. It's hard to explain where I stand in this situation. I know I can't be with anyone else. He's... he's just... incredible. We get along so well. I loved when I was there last weekend. I loved when he came home from work, we cuddled on the couch and I rubbed his neck and shoulders. He told me about his day and I told him about his. I really wanted to hear how his day went, and he wanted to know how mine went. He appreciated the cleaning I had done, and as he ate sliced tomatoes, I watched, and felt a great sense of ... (cue made up word) Rightness. It all just seemed.. right. We never feel awkward. We never feel scared, or, wrong... everything has been how it should be. How I've always wanted. The only thing missing was a Golden retriever, a basketball hoop over the garage, and a white picket fence. 


In 10 minutes it'll be tuesday.


I get to see him on Saturday, at least. Maybe even friday! 


He thinks I'm beautiful. I believe him. It's hard for a girl like me to feel that about herself, or to believe that someone means it. But I do. I know he does.

"event","People who say:

<i> ""suicide is the easy way out""</i>

So mater-of-fact'ly. Are absolutly right. Suicide IS the easy way out. 

But people who say that have also never experienced anything worth dying for.


I'm not talking about working their way up the corporate ladder. I'm talking about other things. Some people can't even touch a step. People who say that.. have never been beaten, or abused, they've never feared for their life. They've never been followed to their house by a gang of thugs. They've never gone a week without sleep. They've never had to decide between food or electricity. They've never buried any of their friends. They've never, been alone. 



It really bothers me to know that people feel so strongly about an issue, without experiencing it. They have no idea what it's like to hate your life so much that you want it to end. So naturally, if they haven't felt it, or experienced it... it must be wrong. 


Being clsoed minded is so ignorant. I'm not sure if that makes sense. It does to me, and that's all I really care about right now. TO my knowledge I still don't have any readers.

I'm sick of NOT worrying about things.. people my age worry about.




I'm sick of worrying about not having insurence.... I'm sick of worrying that if I don't get back on meds and doctors .. that.. I don't have much time left.


I'm sick that I rely on people to keep me alive.

"event","I'm afriad another entry filled with sadness, depression, and anxiety are upon us. My fellow readers. I don't belive I have any thus far. 



Today had the potential to be an ok day. However I was wrong. 



I went with a friend to see another friend of ours, play with his band. That was alright. I saw some old friends. Enjoyed myself.

The friend I went with, latly, has been making things extremly akward for me. He brings up things. He's always liked me. I admit. I led him on, not realizing the full.. well... I didn't realize how much he was interested in me. This was also back when I had the lowest self esteem in the world and basically, well. TO be perfectly blunt, I was a bit of a slut. But it's not like I went out looking for it. I think guys tend to realzie that. THey know what to say.They take advantage of it. I eventually got used to it.


It's like when a child gets abused by it's parents, in a lot of cases, they grow to do the same to their children. It becomes natural and.. ""home"".


I actually used to be very religious. My faith was so strong nothing could break it. I stood my ground, let people know what I beleived in. I didn't care because I knew what was right and things would be ok for me forever, because I beleived and I had faith.

How blind I was.


Things in my home life turned sour. A lot has been blocked and I wish so bad that I could know what went on. I remember things here and there, but I was too little. It started when my older sister was in college. She was going through some things and would get very upset, very easilly. I remember there was always yelling, and screaming and crying, and throwing, and pushing and hitting... as I grew older, subconsciously that's what I looked for in who I dated. And I found it. 


A month before I turned 17 my (at the time) boyfriend, decided he COULDN'T be with a virgin. So he decided it was his duty to take it from me. And he did. I cried. In case you're wondering I did break up with him. Only after trying to reason with him. 

After that, I had a secret fling with someone 10 years older than me.

I went on to date an alcoholic with a 2 year old. He left me for his ex fiance' a week after Valentine's day. He did come crawling back to my doorstep when she turned around and did the same thing to him. Of course I went to his house that night and we of course, went on to have sex. I don't call that making love because.. it wasn't. There was never any love involved in that.


Last year I met someone who was extremly forceful and never gave me time to think about anything. Everytime I saw him, he beat down my self esteem. He would make me feel like the biggest idiot on the planet. Everything I said and did was wrong. I was never right. I didn't talk enough to his friends. I was getting TOO nice to his friend. He wouldn't allow me to wear tight, or revealing things. And I had to have sex with him, at every waking moment. It got to the point where I would cry. Hysterically. He would then yell at me because my crying made him feel bad. That all ended when we had one final fight. It was in October. At 2:00 in the morning. He had taken the coat I was wearing. I was left in short sleeves. It was snowing/hailing. I was freezing. Tears were freezing on my cheeks. He yelled at me, again for crying. Then again for shivering. He said I should be used to the cold because that's what my heart is. Cold. He wouldnt let me speak. Even if he could I wasn't able to. To this day. It's the most intimidating thing I can recall. He towered over me by a foot. He was twice my size. Could easilly pick me up over his head. I was fearing for my life. He was insane. I was searching for a place to run. My car was so close, but he was in between us. He stood right in front of me. Kept pushing me, and pushing me. harder each time. I don't know why. But finally he let me go. 


and I was gone. I drove, and cried. I thought I was going to die. I thought he was going to kill me. 




I've. I've been through a lot. I can't even remember where I was trying to go with this but.. It feels good to be able to get this all out. It's been a while since I've been able to really talk about it.


I was going on about how.. well. How I've done some things I regret. But I do think that, I'm generally a good person. We all have our shadows and spider webbs in our closets that are locked up and sealed tight. I'm not trying to give myself an exucse. I think excuses and reasons are two completly different things that often get confused. 


There's so much I want to say but, the words just won't come. 


I'm scared I guess. Of a lot. I have an interview I should be sleeping for. I'm falling head over heels for someone. And I'm.. afraid of what my future has in store for me.

"event","He is a teacher. He teaches music. He also lends his hand to a marching band. Yesterday they had a competition. He asked me to come see it.


I took the 40 minute drive after work.


I didn't get to see him until after they went on. I had an enormous sense of pride for these kids. I know how much he loves them, and how much he enjoys working with them. In seconds I could understand why. I don't know if it was from the cold, or, maybe because I hadn't eaten all day. But I had tears forming behind my eyes. 


I walked around the feild to where they were supposed to exit. I stood waiting for him to see me. He turned around and stopped. Then he smiled and said ""Hey you.."" and came over. We hugged and I told him how excited I was and how amazing they were. He had to leave for a few moments, but when he returned we walked. 


I met a lot of people. Kids, Parents, Teachers, wives.. they were all exceptionally nice and wanted to know how we met. He was thrilled to tell the amusing story, and the listener also showed their enjoyment. 


We went out to a little restaurant/bar, afterward. None of them seemed to care that I was underage. They didn't realzie it either. They simply thought I didn't drink. But for once in my life.. it wasn't important. They still talked with me, and I may be jumping to conclusions, but I feel as if I fit in. 


I was pulled in by his conversation. His passion, his.. charisma. Everything. I was drawn to him. I couldn't stop staring at him, and smiling. 


It was... an amazing night. Next week there's another competition near me. I want to go. 



We left the bar late. CLose to 1. 


We went to a diner. Just the two of us. We were in seperate cars but, he called me and we talked the whole way there. We drove by the place we met for the first time. We both said something about it.



For some reason I really just didn't want to see him go. I know it'll be another week before I can see him again. I know that isn't long. I just wish there was a way we could be clsoer together. He lives about three hours away from here. But his family lives here. So he stays with them when he comes. 


I kept hanging on to him. Not wanting to let go. I rested my head on his chest, he rested his head on mine, and we stood. Arms wrapped around eachother...



oh. How I wish this were easier... But I guess it woulnd't be worth it then, right?"

"event","I need a drink. An extremly strong drink. The kind that deserves a tiny sword with a cherry on the end of it. Maybe I could just throw one of those in there anyway. I beleive all drinks should be entitled to having a miniature sword, with a cherry poked onto the end. That would make the drink much more satisfying. 

Sometimes I wish I was smarter so I could be farther in life than I am. I truly am afraid of people.  Everyone expects so much from me. I feel it's a great accomplishment that I even finished high school. I don't think many people in my position could have. I lost my grandmother and a friend by his own hand. I tried to kill myself. I realized I was too scared to do that. I continued to cut. In fact. It hasn't even been a full year since I stopped. I don't even know why I don't do it anymore. I don't know how. I had several doctors, and my guidence councelor holding me in these plastic bubbles. I was on medication. I was failing. I was skipping classes. I never did my work. I don't know how I got out of there. 

Two months after graduation I was raped by my boyfriend. I broke up with him. I at least did ONE smart thing for myself. I tried college. I failed every class. Haven't been back since. I decided I needed to accomplish more important things. I had to get away from the yelling, and screaming, and crying of my house. I got a good job. I moved into a crappy apartment with 2 annoying, dirty, lying roomates. I bought a car. I was doing ok.



I got laid off. Lost my job. And both of my roomates decided to leave. Another thing I've failed at. 


<i> just add it to the list</i>


My parents weren't going to let me move back in. To tell you the truth I didn't want them to. I was prepared to live in my car. My sister made my parents ""welcome"" me back. I've been mooching off of them ever since. Though I hate taking money from them and I lie when they ask if I need any. I know they'll just hold it against me later. 



I want so much just to be able to leave this place. I want to go away from everyone. I love my friends but I don't ever see them. So it wouldn't matter if I was here or not. 



I need to get away. 



I'd love to live with him. But I know that's not an option right now. For one, my car wouldn't be able to handle the winter months. Two?... actually I think that's about the only reason..."

"event","I arrived late. It was nice to know he went out looking for me. I pulled into his driveway shortly after he did himself. I threw myself on him, and we hugged, and I beleive he kissed my forehead. We walked inside.

I feel at home when I'm there. He explained he had more work to do than he thought, and would most likly be up all night. I wasn't too happy. But that's because I'm selfish and wanted him all to myself. 

We spent a bit of time cuddling on a tiny chair. We ended up kissing, and rolling around on the floor, Laughing, and smiling sweetly. We would tickle one another every now and then. Sometimes I still think it's wrong. I forget that it isn't. In fact, I'm not sure if anything has ever been more right.




We ate pizza. I ate with my hands, he ate with a fork and knife. We smiled and spoke with our minds silently across the table. 



I fell asleep on the couch as he worked. I awoke at 2 a.m to him touching my face lightly, asking if I wanted to go to bed. He finished his work earlier than expected, and had already taken a shower and was in his boxers and a t-shirt.

We spent a lot of time talking. As always. He touched me up and down. He held me tight and made me laugh. He's the only one who can make me smile like that. 

We made love for the first time. He had never done so before. I have been with 7. I still can't help feeling a bit ashamed. But it dosen't matter to him. But, in all of those times.. I've never had such an enjoyable, fun, romantic time. 

I got a bump on the head from a board that was laying on the top of the bed. It fell down on me and brought tears to my eyes. Yet, we spent the rest of the night sleeping in eachothers arms. 




I can't help but feel that I'll never figure my life out. Some say my life has been a lot harder than others. Then again.. some say my life has been a lot easier as well. 



I am well aware that I have issues. That's nothing I've ever tried to hide. In fact, I tell people out flat when I meet them that I'm not what they're going to expect. There's a whole other side to me that no one knows. 


I've had this image of being a sweet, smart, all around good girl. When, in all reality it's exactly the opposite. I've never really enjoyed school. I may seem sweet and innocent and in some ways I am. But there are plenty of things that would cause my family to disown me. And sometimes I feel that wouldn't be the worst thing that could happen to me.

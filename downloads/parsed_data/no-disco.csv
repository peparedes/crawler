"event","i'm such a terrable person. the things that go through my head are rediulous. 

i just want to snuff it. but there's no way i could. i care too much about amy and my family to do that to them. i don't want to leave amy alone. i mean i know she has other friends, but we've bonded. like i know if she ever went away i don't know what i'd do with myself. i'm not sure if she feels the same, but i don't want to question it. 

i want to cut so bad. 

this day sucks."

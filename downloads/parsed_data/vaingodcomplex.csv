"event","It's been so long since I wrote an entry. Livejournal has even changed it's format since the last time.

I've thought about writing almost everyday. I have no idea why I never did. Not much to say. I wonder about Crow alot. I miss him, I miss Tony, I miss Michael. I work a lot, I waste a lot of time. I waste so much time. I haven't really accomplished anything lately. Seems like I should be writing all the time if I've got nothing important going on.

I got a letter from Crow a little while ago. I was so excited. I sat without opening it for at least half an hour savoring that I had it. Then thought about how stupid I was and that I was probably making a big deal out of something that would say, ""I've had some time to think about things and I don't think we should have anything to do with each other anymore."" 

So that's when I finally opened it.

It didn't say that. It was a bittersweet letter. I'm not sure I want to talk about it here, but I'm going to talk to him about it. Well, write to him about it. How sad it makes me that Crow is scared of himself. And I don't mean scared of himself like most people are-like they think they'll do something bad, they think they're a bad person...I just mean...I don't know. Maybe that he doesn't understand himself. And how he must not trust himself at all, not to allow himself to relax and accept himself.

I've got a black pussy cat outfit for halloween. :D"

I'm learning to cook well, finally! Because I'm finding out here it's easier to get to know my nieghbors by offering food. :p

Sometimes it's nice being forced to meet new people. Sometimes it sucks and I just want somebody sincere who knows me to curl up on the couch with.

I feel like things are just more fake in my life without the SC here. Meghan is going to sleep over this weekend. That should be nice.

I don't know what else to say about my life at the moment."

"event","Got a letter from him yesterday and Tony said he'd break my heart. She didn't tell me that today. But she told me, earlier.

Those are the two things I've been thinking about since receiving that letter.

I always forget how things happen. When Tony said that I thought that maybe Crow couldn't break my heart because I had made sure he already had before we even started. From before the beginning I knew it wouldn't last, or maybe not be much, or maybe hurt enough to not need it to last. So I had already done the harm of breaking my own heart. Can you break a heart that's been pre-broken?

He's softening it, or sewing it, or something so that he can someday break it again worse, I guess.
I got the letter, read it, starred at it for a couple of minutes not knowing what to think and then just started balling and balling.

There have been so many things that I just did not expect happening ever since I came to the Singing Company. Nothing that's happened there has been like the rest of the world is."

What do you think?

I got another e-mail from him today. :) I thought he wouldn't respond again because he took a while. And he said I say thing sweetest things...do I? I didn't even remember what I might've said in my last e-mail to him, but he left it under his response. I suppose it must've been the thing about me wanting him to feel comfortable to say anything, no matter if he'll mean it in the future or not.

Off topic, I was thinking today that I don't believe in hardly anything. And how that seems almost...I don't know. I feel like for the kind of person I am, I should or something. But I don't believe in God. I rarely believe compliments people tell me. I don't think I believe in true love or love at first site or things like that even though sometimes I pretend I do...I've never believed in soul mates, something I always worried about with Michael. I don't believe people can stay faithful with the right oppurtunities. Sometimes I almost think I don't believe in love. I mean...I do because I swear I've felt it. But at the same time...can you really love someone if you can hurt them? And I think in some way I've hurt everyone I've said I love. And not all of it has been on purpose, but I still have chosen some of the hurtful choices with my eyes open.

And if my love is real, then why would I get so scared when I think of the idea that Tony and I could ever be meant to be with each other? If I love her, which I swear if I don't love her I don't love anybody, why should the idea alone scare me? 

If love is real then why can I not ever imagine being with only one person? I don't think anything could last long enough...nothing could stay satisfying for that long.

But not believing in love has got to be pretty stupid, right?

Funny thing is, all these things I don't believe in, they're the things I love most about entertainment. I love love stories, any kind-soul mates, love at first site-all of them.

I allow myself to fall for everything, I don't protect myself from much, I don't do what's best for me, and yet...I'm not sure what I mean. It seems like I shouldn't do everything I do if I don't believe in anything.

Anyways, that's probably all just a bunch of mumble-jumble-thinking too much or me being in a weird mood or something. All that matters right now is that I think I'm going to have a wonderful little trip this week! :D"

It's going to be a little different than usual because my make-up is very...natural and light. Just a litte eyeliner, not around the whole eye, and not dark. Very light green eye shadow. Light pink lip-stick with no lip liner! Eek! I don't remember the last time I wore that simple of make-up. But I'm ex-cit-ed!

I also got my DVD of Breakfast on Pluto today! I'm thinking if I might try to get Crow to watch it with me...

Yes, I know it's probably a high chance that he would change his mind or simply just forget that he ever brought it up, but...it would be fun, wouldn't it?
How would I keep up appearances, yes, I know, but it sounds marvelous enough for him to take me anywhere that I couldn't help but be excited anyways.

Oh...and I certainly hope talking about him in my livejournal doesn't count as telling people about him...the only people that read this are the people that already know, anyways."

"event","I have nothing profound to write. Maybe I should go subject by subject.

About Michael:

Tony seemed to act like it might have meant something if Michael had known when I went out walking with him that I wanted to pull him into a hotel and do him. I don't think it would've made a difference. I don't think I would've persuaded him. Which is why I didn't try, of course. I would've have gone for it if I thought I could do it.

It's not a surprise to me how bad it hurt to have him...not want me around. Not be able to comfort him. Not surprising how much I hated seeing Milo and him go off together. Not surprising how it made me cry to read Michael's entry about Milo. None of it's surprising to me, but not everyone's me. If I'm moving onto new conquests that means I don't care about old ones, that's the stupid assumed idea out there for some people. I miss him. It hurts.

My life's not on pause anymore. If I would've been able to do anything with Michael that day I would've been involved with all three of them, in that one day. Crow, Michael, Tony.

About Tony:

I have even less of an idea of what I can write about her. I now feel that I'm more confused about us than she is. It gives me the feeling that my confusion is hurting her. But Tony's tougher than that. And she knows me better than that. Right? Am I doing wrong by her or does confusion and fear pardon me? Is not being ready wrong?

About Crow:

I felt like I was in a movie. In a dream. It was beautiful. I felt pure and safe and so delicate. I felt young and naive and easily able to dream. I didn't feel any dread. I didn't feel like I wanted to cry for fear of when I would lose what was happening and when the disillusion would happen. I felt so good that it didn't occur for me to think about that until the morning. 

And then seeing Michael and Tony that day, it made everything with Crow feel too new that it must have had to have been shallow and empty compared to them.

I can't think about them all at the same time. Each one taints the other. I'm very disjointed."

"event","A lot of talk going around about jealousy lately.
I'm so horrible for liking it. And the fact that something hurtful to Michael is what brought on him being more physical with me in public. Kind of like a double-edged sword. I'm getting what I want, but at the expense of someone I love.

Michael, you are never invisable. You didn't need to remind me of who you were there. My attention was on you.

Is it really wrong of me to take down someone else's barriers? Is that something reserved for people who aren't in a relationship with someone else? It's not a question to Michael...just a question, I guess. Maybe to myself. I don't know.

Getting hurt and getting what you want are close together. Maybe I can feel so much hurt because I take more risks than some? And maybe getting what I want sometimes is what hurts me. Maybe I want the wrong things, or maybe I only get half of what I want.
It's true that sex is important to me, but of course I'm hurt if that's all I can manage to get.

I don't know. It's just a little bit of me thinking aloud.

Keep being comforted about what Tony said. About things hurting in me more or something like that."

But Michael was brave. He wrote. And he let me read it. And afterall, why shouldn't he? It's about *us*.

I still don't know what to write. But I feel better and I miss Michael and I just want to spend more time with him. It's getting harder and harder to aviod things by sex. What if someday, that's not enough?

There are a lot of things I can't quite put words to yet about that conversation with Michael. We seemed so defeated. It was depressing me. It was defeating me.

It's true, I'm not sure I could go through a promise of breaking up with Michael like Michael did with Milo. But that's because I don't think I could ever want to give up what we have. That's not honest either, right? Not like I put that much into honesty. And if someone broke up with me just because they had wavering thoughts about someone else I would think that what we had wasn't very important to him if he was willing to drop it over just thoughts.

But then again, I've never thought Michael thought what he had with Milo wasn't a big deal just because he went with me. I just thought I was a bigger deal.
Because that's what I'm like. Not because it's true.

I still don't know what I'm thinking, really. I just have to keep telling myself to breathe. So I know it's something."

Well...these were made for women, but:

What's Your Sex Personality?
By Amy Keyishian

Your Results  

	
Wild & Crazy

Congratulations -- you are an uninhibited divinity of doin' it, and the man in your life is oh-so-lucky to have you! You're a tigress who loves to bust out daring lingerie, erotic accoutrements, and inventive suggestions. You're more than likely to be the one to make the first move. And when the time comes for satisfaction, you know what to do and how to get there, with or without male assistance.

So what do you do with your wealth of knowledge? Share it -- with your girlfriends. ""So many women fall into the mistaken notion that long-term love means a death of sexy adventure,"" say Emma Jane Taylor and Lorelei Sharkey, also known as Em & Lo, the coauthors of Nerve's Guide to Sex Etiquette for Ladies and Gentlemen (Plume, February 2004). ""If you let your friends know how great things are going for you (without being boastful or obnoxious about it, of course), they just might be inspired to stoke their own home fires.""

Are You Boring in Bed?

Your Results:

Vanilla Sex? Nope! More Like Rocky Road Mixed with Peppermint Twist!

Some like it hot. And some like it totally on fire! That's you -- men might call you a lot of things, but ""boring"" isn't one of them. Whoever gets to share the sheets with you is in for a wild ride, and probably appreciates the heck out of your passionate proclivities!

""You've bucked the trend,"" says Lisa Douglass, PhD, coauthor of The Sex You Want: A Lover's Guide to Women's Sexual Pleasure (Marlowe & Co., 2003). ""Studies show that sexual satisfaction is hard for a lot of women to achieve -- but if you're expressing this level of passion to your partner, you're surely in tune with your sexy side."" And more power to you.

""Just remember to stay true to yourself,"" Douglass warns. ""Focus on pleasure, not performance, and together you and your partner will reach new, deeper levels of intimacy."" Keep exploring and enjoying the kind of pleasure that shoots out your fingertips and creates a lascivious light-show for the guy who's lucky enough to call you Missus."

Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. 

They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder.

It'd really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment.

The Ultimate Personality Test
The Real You: A Scientific Analysis

Ellis, you're a Shark!

Your personality is actually determined by two personality sub-types - your primary, or dominant sub-type, and your secondary sub-type. You are a Shark which means you are a Seeker / Success Your primary sub-type is defined by ""Seeker"" characteristics and your secondary sub-type is defined by ""Success"" characteristics.

That means you've got a robust love of life and a killer instinct. Chances are you hate rules, and don't plan on getting old. You're flexible and friendly on top of being innovative and smart. In short, people respect you.


Oh my! Look at this one! 
Actually, it's kind of touching too much on a touchy subject near the end...

Tradionally known as a ""siren"", ""rake"", or ""femme fatale."" You exude sensuality.
And while your sexiness is part of what makes you an incredible seducer...
Your ability to make others feel sexy is what really makes your seduction skills shine.

Most people don't feel attractive or desired enough - a need which you tap into.
You have the ultimate sex appeal, and getting attention from you is a total self esteem boost.
Your confidence is contagious, and you help others unleash their own sexuality.

Your sex pot seduction skills are so intoxicating that you can get away with... well, almost murder.
Lovers feel like your sensuality is in your blood, so it's only natural if you flirt a little.
And if you stray, that might be okay as well - as long as you make your lover still feel hot.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>"

"event","Some serious conversations with Michael were scary. I'm glad they happened, but it's the type of thing that by the end, neither one of us really felt much more secure about any of it. We just understood more. Being in relationships with complex human beigns is complicated, isn't it? I never really knew the true extent of it before. 

Still, probably a little reason that we made love so much was because we were scared of having more troubling conversations. That, and we're so damn sexy and in love together. ;)

I will never, ever get sick of that boy. I want to be spoiled and have him by my side every moment. 

Except, I want time with Tony, too. So I guess that's not all entirely true.

Once in a while, it's nice to have the attention from a big crowd. But having too much of that can make you feel pretty lonely, too.

I remember sneaking through window's in the dead of winter. I always just wanted her to stay asleep so I could crawl into her warm bed with her, snuggle under the covers next to her, without her knowing. Of course this couldn't happen, even if I could sneak in. I was ice cold, she'd feel me and wake up. A person can feel you, but still not wake up. That's what I wanted.

------------------------------------

A group of professional people posed this question to a group of 4 to 8
year-olds, ""What does love mean?""

The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone could have
imagined. See what you think:


""When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails anymore.

So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too. That's love.""

Rebecca- age 8

**********

++""When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different.

You just know that your name is safe in their mouth.""

Billy - age 4

(This is my very favorite!)

**********

""Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other.""

Karl - age 5

**********

""Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French fries without making them give you any of theirs.""

Chrissy - age 6

**********

""Love is what makes you smile when you're tired.""

Terri - age 4

**********

""Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK.""

Danny - age 7

**********

++""Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get tired of kissing, you still want to be together and you talk more.
My Mommy and Daddy are like that. They look gross when they kiss""

Emily - age 8

**********

""Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen.""

Bobby - age 7

**********

""If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who you hate,""

Nikka - age 6

**********

""Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it
everyday.""

Noelle - age 7

**********

++""Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well.""

Tommy - age 6

**********

++""During my piano recital, I was on a stage and I was scared. I looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling.

He was the only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore.""

Cindy - age 8

**********

""My mommy loves me more than anybody .

You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night.""

Clare - age 6

**********

""Love is when Mommy gives Daddy the best piece of chicken.""

Elaine-age 5

**********

""Love is when Mommy sees Daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford.""

Chris - age 7

**********

""Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day.""

Mary Ann - age 4

**********

""I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones.""

Lauren - age 4

**********

++""When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you.""
Karen - age 7

(I think this girl may have been watching some anime!!)
**********

""Love is when Mommy sees Daddy on the toilet and she doesn't think it's gross.""

Mark - age 6

**********

""You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget.""

"event","I did some looking around today and I found out that in Minnnesota and New York either Michael or I could have a child and the other could legally have ""second parent adoption"" rights. Which means we could legally have all the rights to the child together. :) I know, that's all too far in the future to really think about, but.
Oh, but in our home state, it's ""unlcear"" if we could have rights. Basically, there are no state laws stating it yet, and no one there has challenged it yet, either. Maybe by the time I should actually be thinking about this, we will be able to have the rights there, too! :)

Oh, but we couldn't even drive through the state of Oklahoma because they don't accept the laws of other states on this issue. Which means that if I weren't biologically the parent, they could take my kid away from me just for walking or driving there with the child. Sick, huh?"

"event","I don't want to write because I don't want people to tell me I shouldn't do this anymore, and I don't want anyone to be worried, and I don't want anyone to bother thinking about it, really.

But I feel like I have to at least talk about it. It would've been find if I hadn't been so stupid in the first place. That's the worst part. I should be smarter.

Ok. So, the place that I'm working for as a Drag Queen now has shows every night. To feel it out, they told me I could pick the first couple of nights I wanted to work, then they would assign nights after this week. I was pretty excited about it, so I started right on Halloween. Which went good, I had fun and didn't do anything naughty! ;)

I worked again last night. And that didn't go so good...I don't really know how to talk about it. And it wasn't really anything, but it still feels like something. There was a man there that was really drunk, but he was being sweet enough so I was being friendly to him. He was wearing a green baseball hat and a dirty yellow t-shirt and jeans and old work boots. He wasn't handsom, but he was by no means ugly, either.
Eventually work was done and I was in the dressing rooms cooling off. The manager there asked me if I wanted to have a bodygaurd to my car. Me, thinking that nothing would happen to little old me, said, ""Oh no! I'll be fine!"" And smiled.

So I left later, by myself. The man was there, outside, and I didn't think much of it. He started coming over to me and coming on to me, and I was laughing and smiling, because I was nervous, and he kept pushing me up against a wall outside. And I kept saying no, but I couldn't stop laughing either because I was so scared and that's what I do when I'm scared. And I could hear other guys laughing around the corner and I just wanted them to hear me saying no, and think that I meant it, but I know they thought I didn't mean it because I was laughing.

And I tried to push him away with force and he didn't mean to be hurting me, he was just drunk and he wanted attention, but he pushed me again and I hit the back of my head against the wall really really hard. And then I started crying because I thought something really bad had happened for how bad it hurt. And then he left me alone, so I just sat there holding my head and crying hoping that it would stop hurting so I could drive home. 

I got home. It still hurts tonight. It's swollen and red and bruised and I'm so worried that something's actually wrong because this horrible headache won't go away-but nothing serious could have happened, right? I don't want to go to the doctor, especially if I'm just being stupid...

But I still want to work there, all the Queens were so nice! From now on I'll just have a bodygaurd come with me and everything will be ok. 

Oh, by the way, the picture icon I'm using for this entry is how I looked for my first night there, before they offered me the job! :) It's a little blurry-I guess I was in too much motion! ;)"

"event","I remember in high school I had a world history class. On a section for Egypt we ended up having to choose a ruler to write a paper on. I did research and found two people that absolutely fascinated me.

The one that I ended up doing a paper on was a female Pharaoh called Hatshepsut. She had statues and pictures made of her as male. She had herself referred to as male and said that she was supposed to be male. That her spirit was male. And I remember my teacher commenting on how sad it was that she had to take the route of saying she was supposed to be male to be a ruler. I remember it being a feminist issue with her. And I just thought that maybe it was really true, you know? That she really did feel like she was supposed to be male. If it happens today, it had to happen then. I remember being so attracted to the idea of her.

The other intriguing person I found was very close to the same time period. It was a Pharaoh called Akhetaten. He changed his kingdom's religion to be on one god instead of multiple gods. But he also made the god sex-less, when all of the other egyptian gods had specific sexes. Along with the change of religion, he changed the art style. His statues and pictures are depicted as him having curves, a skinny waist and large hips. He looks very feminine. History people who study these types of things said that he may have wanted the statues to look like that to emphasize that he was like his god and his god didn't have a set sex. Other people said that with all of the incest going on in those times, it could've been due to that-medical people said those signs were common or something. And what I thought the whole time was maybe he was a hermaphrodite. Because if they have them now, they also had to have had them then. And I wondered why this never seemed to be a possibility. But maybe they all just knew more than me."

I'm staring at a blank screen.

I had a dream I was getting married and I had a tux and a wedding dress ready for me and I couldn't decide which one to wear. Started having a panic attack in the dream, and then I woke up and couldn't breathe. Austin was awake and asked if I was OK. I couldn't answer him.
He started saying, ""Oh shit."" 
I don't know if Tamahome was already awake or not, but he was suddenly in front of me. He put both his hands on my shoulders and said, ""Calm down. Breathe with me, slowly.""

It worked after a little while. I never noticed Tamahome was so calming. It was so nice that he tried to help. Well, did help.
Still, the whole incident is just so embarrassing.

I remember when my Mother would calm me at home. Dad didn't like it. He said it just re-enforced my childish behaviors. I'd try to keep it under control, try to keep it secret, but that would just make it worse until I was falling over or running into things or coughing and gagging and then Mom would hear me anyway.

My throat hurts and I've got a horrible headache."

You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and free.

In love, you feel the most alive when everything is uncertain, one moment heaven... the next moment hell.

You'd like to your lover to think you are optimistic and happy.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was ruthless, cold-blooded, and sarcastic.

Your ideal relationship is comforting. You crave a relationship where you always feel warmth and love.

Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about society and morality. You would never break a commitment.

You think of marriage as something precious. You'll treasure marriage and treat it as sacred.

"event","I read Bobbie's entry last night, and I'm not exactly sure why, but I was a little angry. Maybe it was because I was embarassed of being tense and scared to do it with her. I don't like the idea out there that I've *ever* been nervous or scared of sex. I know it's probably true that theres not a soul out there that hasn't felt that way, but still...
Maybe it was because she said it wasn't me, and I still always thought it was. Have always thought it was. After reading her view of the night, I still think it was. I'm embarassed or ashamed, thought it was an insult to me. And now it's out there for anyone to see. When before, just she knew. Like all our other little secrets.

So last night when I went to bed, I had dreams of Bobbie. I had dreams of her in skimpy black leather. I had dreams of me inside her, and her inside me. I had dreams that I was forceful with her, because of course in life I've hardly even been forceful with her, in any situation.

This morning I read over her entry again. I wasn't angry at all. It was just like looking at fond memories in a scrapbook.
So I don't know.

And now I have to decided if I should private this or not. From Tony, from Michael.
I've decided I shouldn't."

I always used to think about what a catch I'd be, if someone I wanted really wanted me. I never knew if I was joking or saying that to make myself feel better, or if I actually believed it. It's easy to think those things when it's hypothetical. Am I a catch now? I don't know.

I haven't dressed up for a while now. Sometimes you say things, and you're not sure what it means, but you know it's on the tip of your tongue. You know you just want someone else to care enough about you, or know enough about you to decode it. To tell you. And to be right. But being right is just the icing on the cake. All that really matters is they were interested.

At this moment, what I want more than anything in the world is a thunderstorm. A thunderstorm where Michael is sitting in front of me, my chest to his back, my face on his neck and shoulder, my legs straddling him and touching the side of his stomach and touching his legs as well. My arms coming from behind him and under his armpits to rest my hands on his collar bone or shoulders. Or just to hold him tight against my stomach.

And I almost said ""But it doesn't matter what I want most right now, because I can't have it."" And while it's true that I can't have it right now, maybe it does matter that I want it. Maybe it matters to Michael."

So many songs do. ""Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" because it was playing once and this guy I was interested in started to sing it to me. And he was just doing a sound check or something, but he was looking into my eyes, and it was the most sensitive or sincere I had ever seen him.

"event","We'll i have to say that a lot of shit has happenedsince ive last written, lots of drama, and lots of shit thats more then drama! But i come out of this knowing who my real friends are and knowing who ill never care about again. Ya know i was there for a few people LOTS of times, and i helped them out, and when it comes back to me needing the help they throw it in my face. Well i see now, u were never worth my breat, u were never worth my time, and u never will be again. The shit people have put me through is unforgiveable and never will be forgotten or forgiven. But one thing i will say is no matter how much i hate some people right now, i would never wish upon them the things that i have gone through in the last week and a half. But to everyone who has been there for me and has given me good advice and cared about me, i love you guys and ill always remember it, no matter what. It sucks to know that u have to go through deep pain to see who truly cares and whose just a STUCK UP, SELF OBSORBED WANNABE BITCH!!

We'll im so excited beause my mom just told me were going up to Old Forge for their big Winter Festival weekend February 11,12, and 13. I invited amber so hopefully she'll be able to go!! i know we'll have so much fun up there together!

I went over to ambers where ashleigh and amber were chillin and merielle and danielle soon showed up after me. We got pizza and chilled then started to get ready. We did Danny's hair and she looked hot (Anybody know where the crack bobby pin is!!!)insiders!!! after that we all got dressed by this point it was like 10 of 9 and the dance started at 8. We all got into our dresses take up all the rooms amber had upstairs haha then we got pictures taken and headed to the dance!! omg driving in heals like that is hard!! In short about the dance, it sucked and they played shity music but we danced anyways and made as much fun out of it as we could. after the dance the other girls went to dennys and i went and saw lindsay and bill for a little while before nick called me and told me about the ALCOHOL!@#$% yea u better believe thats where i went!! lindsay whose amazing and offered to be my DD brought me over. I got there and within a half an hour i had already caught up to the two that amber had already had and finished off ashleighs when lindsay told me to chug then said i better not, so i did it!!@ yea i must have drank it to quick because i was BUZZIN!@#$%^& anyone who talked to me when i got home knew that!! lol...it was a nite of many fun memories that i will never forget and i will take with me!! oh yea and ryan made fun of me than hung up on me!! yea im loved...  :(

"event","Well today couldnt have started any better then a phone call at 12:50 from ryan! i havent talked to him in so long, ive missed him!! well he definetly made my day so much better! The crappy end was that lately ive been gettin really bad headaches and since i woke up this morning ive had a bad headache that wouldnt go away so fourth block when Kilpy wouldnt let me skip gym and go to his study hall i left and went home, but then i had to go to work and work for 5 and a half hours which blew! my headache stayed all through work and i decided two customers into my nite that i wasnt helping anyone because they were all rude ass holes so i stood behind the register until someone asked me for help or were nice to me! the two things that brightened my nite are the two little babies that i was playing games with! they were so cute and they made me smile!! i was happy. Well Ryan was supposed to call me tonite and its 12:00 and he hasnt yet, if he calls and wakes me up i will kill him. actually since ive missed him, he would be the only one that i wouldnt mind calling me!! i miss that boy!!Oh yea and the first song i heard after work when i got in the car was my Boo by usher and alicia keys, the song that reminds me of ryan :(...ill get him back tho!@#$% im determined...hahaha hope he reads this!! lol love ya!! well kiddies im off to bed...leave some love...

"event","OMG today was so much fun! i spent all day with my mom and it was great. First we decided to go to breakfast and pardzees then we ran over to walmart and got my presents for this lil girl for environmental class. Then my mom took me to the mall because she needed some ideas for me for christmas. i ended up seeing a bunch of presents that she bought for me while i was there. Then she was awesome and bought me jewelry to go with my cotillion dress for saturday!! i cant wait its my senior semi formal, my last one. :( After the mall we went home and i came up with the awesome idea that me n her should go get the christmas tree. My dad was reffing a tournament down at colgate so it was just me n her the two blondest women of them all cutting down a tree with a very sharp saw. Well it took us two hours to find a tree that fit our likin, trust me we are very picky women. Then since i found it i had to be the one to lie in the dirt on my back and cut it down, thats some hard work, but that wasnt all then we had to cary it all the way to the road then all the way down this HUGE hill and back to our car. Once too the car we had to figure out where to put it. It was intresting but i had a great time. After that me n my mom went to kohls so i could show her this hat and scarf that i wanted, we found it so she bought it for me since i knew she would get it for me anyways then we went to P&C and got stuff for dinner then we went and got ice cream from cold stone! omg it was so good. yea we did dessert before dinner but with our intresting day that wasnt anything out of the ordinary. Prolly the worst thing about today was that i ran into BILLY, my crazy stalker that scares the hell out of me, i havent seen him since i met him, and omg lookin at him gave me the chills and made me want to cry, i hope i never run into him again, thank god i was with my mom and not alone because he didnt come up to me. well its 11:30 and i have a long day of school ahead of me tomorrow... so im going to bed... hugs and kisses XOXO

**I thought that by telling myself and everyone else that I hated you. That sooner or later I would come to believe it. But I now realize that by lying, it makes me want you even more

**I thought I'd forget you, but I guess I forgot to

**It's hard to tell your mind to stop loving someone, when you're heart still does

**I wish I was a kid again, because skinned knees are easier to fix then broken hearts

**The worst thing a guy can do is let a girl fall in love when he doesn't intend to catch her fall.

"event","Change my attempt good intentions

Crouched over
You were not there
Living in fear
But signs were not really that scarce
Obvious tears
But I will not
Hide you through this
I want you to help
And please see
The bleeding heart perched on my shirt

Die, withdraw
Hide in cold sweat
Quivering lips
Ignore remorse
Naming a kid, living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red

Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I

Crowned hopeless
The article read living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red
but I will not
Hide you through this
I want you to help

Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I

Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I

Heave the silver hollow sliver
Piercing through another victim
Turn and tremble be judgmental
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste
Eventually you'll one day know

Change my attempt good intentions
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition

Should I, could I
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I"

YOU could have floored me with a feather when I read the staggering report on the statistics of, not only adults in a neurotic orgy of sleeping pill popping, but even prepubescent kids gobbling them down like peanuts. 

 
Damn frightening. 


T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund predicts the market for sleep drugs will top $5 billion nationwide by 2010. 


Are we looking to be a nation of freakin' zombies? 


I wonder whether the living victims of the tsunami are popping their pills; I wonder whether the victims of the Pakistani earthquake are taking their nightly dose; I wonder if those poor people in the Gulf are dodging the bullet by knocking themselves out. Betcha not. 


Of course, people who suffer from the cruelty of insomnia have to get treatment from responsible doctors. And kids afflicted by attention deficit disorder should be treated by the wisdom of skilled medical practitioners. 


But this society always takes the easy way out. 


Of course, I've tossed and turned, worried about my job, my family, my friends and an occasional sickness. But you get up, go to work and get on with the day. 


How on earth do kids from the age of 10 to 19 get their hands on prescription sleeping pills? Does some hustler in the school yard line it up so they can mix the sleeping pills with uppers for yet another drug horror? 


Do they copy their parents, who seem to take the sleeping tablet every time a layer cake collapses, or do the parents give it to them? 


Or do they get it from an absolute blitzkrieg of television commercials that offers everything from a pill to fix your slumber blunder, to anti-depressants which are supposed to make you kick up your heels in joy every time you pop one? 


Someone within the medical society or the government has to put a stop to this before our kids walk around with a perpetual glazed look in their eyes."

Imagine there's no heaven,
It's easy if you try,
No hell below us,
Above us only sky,
Imagine all the people
living for today...

Imagine there's no countries,
It isnt hard to do,
Nothing to kill or die for,
No religion too,
Imagine all the people
living life in peace...

You may say Im a dreamer,
but Im not the only one,
I hope some day you'll join us,
And the world will live as one.

Imagine no possesions,
I wonder if you can,
No need for greed or hunger,
A brotherhood of man,
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...

You may say Im a dreamer,
but Im not the only one,
I hope some day you'll join us,
And the world will live as one."

Graduation day.
Got into a car,
And crashed along the way.

When we arrived late to the wake,
Stole the urn while they 
Looked away,
And drove to the beach
'Cause I knew you'd want it
That way.

And you were standing
On the hood of the car
Singing out loud
When the sun came up.

And I know I wasn't right,
But it felt so good.
And your mother didn't mind,
Like I thought she would.
And that REM song was playing 
In my mind.
And three and a half minutes
Felt like a lifetime

It felt like a lifetime

And you move like water
I could drown in you.
And I fell so deep once,
Till you pulled me through

You would tell me
""No one is allowed to be so proud
They never reach out
When they're giving up.""

And I know I wasn't right,
But it felt so good.
And your mother didn't mind,
Like I thought she would.
And that REM song was playing 
In my mind.
And three and a half minutes
Felt like a lifetime

Are you sitting in the lights?
Or combing your hair again,
And talking in rhymes?
Are you sitting in the lights?

When I got home, heard the phone,
Your parents had arrived.
And your dad set his jaw
Your mom just smiled and sighed.

But they left soon
And I went to my room.
Played that disc that you'd given me,
And I shut my eyes
Swear I could hear the sea.

When we were standing
On the hood of your car
Singing out loud when the sun came up.

And I know I wasn't right,
But it felt so good.
And your mother didn't mind,
Like I thought she would.
And that REM song was playing
In my mind.
And three and a half minutes,
Three and a half minutes,

Felt like a lifetime."

In a room of emptiness
By a freeway I confess
I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death
Reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Anywhere we want to go

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone 
I'll wait for you there
Alone

On my deathbed I will pray
To the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone
Who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall
I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised
The world was bled
And there you led me on

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone 
I'll wait for you there
Alone...alone

And on I read
Until the day was gone
And I sat in regret
Of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed
And all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death
I will wonder on

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone 
I'll wait for you there
Alone...alone"

thats goes for both pro war and anti war people. the anti war people have to realize by getting all steamed up about what the pro war people are saying that they are being just as stupid and ignorant as the pro war people. if you choose to not listen and to get violent at over something ...then you are being a ignorant other fucking and i will have no respect for you. if you want to reach out to someone; show them facts that you can support and back up. if you cant do that ...then dont say a god damn word."

<h3>A GREEN Dragon Lies Beneath!</h3>
</a>
I took the <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/teo592/quiz/dragon.html"" target=""new"">Inner Dragon online quiz</a> and found out I am a Green Dragon on the inside. My Inner Dragon is the embodiment of Nature and the Earth. Greens spend almost all of their time below the canopy or just above the treetops in tropical rain forests. Not a bad life considering every other creature in the forest looks up to me, figuratively and literally. I speak the language of every animal and plant in my domain and know most of them by first name. If people mess with my forests, I'm more than happy to wail on their puny butts. Because of my protector/caretaker role, I am the Earth Elemental dragon.<br><br>

Naturally my whole life pretty much revolves around the other couple million species I keep an eye on, but that's not my whole dragon. I also like to like to impose my steadfast will on others, commune with Nature, and lobby governments for alternative fuels and conservation. My favorable attributes are gemstones, mountains, caves, soil, respect, endurance, responsibility, prosperity, and purpose in life. Folks shouldn't get the idea I'm a hippy pushover though, because my breath weapon is a nasty Fire/Acid combination. Maybe I should invest in a hemp shirt reading ""Don't knock my smock, or I'll clean your clock."" *wink*<br><br>"

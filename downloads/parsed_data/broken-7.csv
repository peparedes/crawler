John and Bob were inseparable childhood friends . One night, they both died in a terrible car accident. 
When John woke up in heaven, he began to search for Bob but could not find him anywhere. Very distraught, he ran to St.Peter and said, ""St.Peter, I know Bob was killed in that accident with me, but I can't find him!"" 

St. Peter said, ""My son, I am sorry to tell you Bob didn''t make it to Heaven."" 

This upset John so much that St. Peter agreed to let him see Bob one more time. St. Peter parted the clouds and John saw Bob sitting in hell with a keg on one side and a beautiful buxom blonde on the other. 

John looked at St. Peter skeptically and said, ""Are you sure I'm in the right place?"" 

""My son,"" St. Peter said, ""looks can be deceiving. You see that keg of beer? It has a hole in it. You see that woman? She doesn't!''"

There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long
business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he
thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while
he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her
screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys
and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex
doll, but that was too close to another man for him.

He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something
special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man
behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man
said, ""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the
trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on,
but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for
weeks, except -- "" and he stopped.

""Except what?"" the man asked.

""Nothing, nothing.""

""C'mon, tell me! I need something!""

""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the
'voodoo dick.'""

""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" he asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old
wooden box, carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there
lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and
said ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this
shop!""

The old man replied, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.""
He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door."" The
voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and
started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the
vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the
door could split, the old man said ""Voodoo dick, get back in
your box!"" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and
lay there, quiescent once more.

""I'll take it!"" said the businessman.

The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally
surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife,
told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had
to do was say ""Voodoo dick, my pussy."" He left for his trip
satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny.
She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her,
but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and
said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch
and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever
experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had
enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still
thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing
worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off.
So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help.
She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to
the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the
way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she
was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and
then asked how much she'd had to drink.

Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been
drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and
wouldn't stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second,
and then said ""Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!"""

One day Mrs. Jones went to have a talk with the minister at the
local church. ""Reverend,"" she said, ""I have a problem, my
husband keeps falling asleep during your sermons. It's very
embarrassing. What should I do?""

""I have an idea,"" said the minister. ""Take this hatpin with you.
I will be able to tell when Mr. Jones is sleeping, and I will
motion to you at specific times. When I motion, you give him a
good poke in the leg.""

In church the following Sunday, Mr. Jones dozed off. Noticing
this, the preacher put his plan to work. ""And who made the
ultimate sacrifice for you?"" he said, nodding to Mrs. Jones.

""Jesus!"", Jones cried as his wife jabbed him the leg with the
hatpin.

""Yes, you are right, Mr. Jones,"" said the minister. Soon, Mr.
Jones nodded off again. Again, the minister noticed. ""Who is
your redeemer?"" he asked the congregation, motioning towards
Mrs. Jones.

""God!"" Mr. Jones cried out as he was stuck again with the hatpin.

""Right again,"" said the minister, smiling. Before long, Mr.
Jones again winked off. However, this time the minister did not
notice. As he picked up the tempo of his sermon, he made a few
motions that Mrs. Jones mistook as signals to bayonet her
husband with the hatpin again.

The minister asked, ""And what did Eve say to Adam after she bore
him his 99th son?""

Mrs. Jones poked her husband, who yelled, ""You stick that
goddamned thing in me one more time and I'll break it in half
and shove it up your ass!""

""Amen,"" replied the congregation."

A couple were driving to a church to get married. On the way, they got into a car accident and died. When they arrive in heaven, they see St. Peter at the gate. They ask him if he could arrange it so they could marry in heaven. 
St. Peter tells them that he'll do his best to work on it for them. 

Three months pass by and the couple hear nothing. They bump into St. Peter and ask him about the marriage. 

He says, ""I'm still working on it."" 

Two years pass by and no marriage. 

St. Peter again assures them that he's working on it. 

Finally after twenty long years, St. Peter comes running with a priest and tells the couple it's time for their wedding. 

The couple marry and live happily for a while. But after a few months the couple go and find St. Peter and tell him things are not working out, and that they want to get a divorce. 

""Can you arrange it for us?"" they ask. 

St. Peter replies, ""Are you kidding?!! It took me twenty years to find a priest up here. How am I gonna find you a lawyer?"""

 there is nothing wrong with the love i feel and yet the love i feel is being forbiden by my own hand. the words that yell inside of me belong to a scared little child that feels tthey have lost the way home. i stand alone in a crowded rooma nd wish to just disapear, to melt into the walls. the fire that now fills my heart burns the rest of me and there is nothing wrong with the heat and still it burns and i want to run. i feel that more tears will only flow if i give into the heat of the flames and then the fire will consume me.

i have already lost to much for me now to lose the flame too but is there anything wrong with the fear i feel... is there anything wrong with the heart the is breaking everyday inside of me. there is nothing wrong with me there is only right for the rest that stad outside of my own made chaos.. a chaos which i long to be free from but lack the courage of my convictions to breath once agian the air of the living and open my mind, body and soul to true joy, to true happiness. there is nothing wrong with me but there is not really anything right either..."

"event","i feel like a child the way that i have been treated lately and im beging to think that a regression back to childhood would not be all that bad. if i could go back a few years, knowing what i know now there are so many things that i would do differently. if i was ever given the chance to time travel i would take it in a heart beat... imagine all of the things that we would be able to stop. we could stop ourselves for falling for the wrong guy, having that extra drink or saying that extra little thing. but i guess that is why we can not change time; because if we could imagine all of the people in this world that would be rich and have everything they wanted. perhaps it is the it is not the passing of time or the situations thta we find ourselves that makes us the people we prehaps it is the way in which we deal with the situations. if we go through life question ing every little thing then we fail to learn the lesson that has been written on the blackboard of life. if we stop asking 'what if' and started asking 'why not'then doesn't it stand to reason that we will begin to understand life and its lessons rather then just constantly questioning it.
ther is not enough time in this short life to understand everything but if we can manage to comprehend the little lessons of life and gain a better understanding of ourselves then it is only reasonable that we learn about ourselves. for those of you who have ever had your heart broken and wished you could go back in time and errase all memory of the person, just rember all of the little lessons that being with that person has taught u about your self. a broken heart will mend with time but the lessons we learn will be with us for the rest of our lives. and if u belive in reincarnation then for the next lives as well...."

"event","I've been so angry (again, again, again!).  This week has been stress, anger, work, stress, depression, stress, busy, stress...and on and on.  It's been a week of very mixed emotions because I'd get really upset by people but then I've also been paid 3 of the best compliments I've ever received this week and that made me super happy.  I'm working on finding a balance, but at the moment I'm just on the upset side.  I hate it when people stop being the person they were and stop being who you need them to be.  I'm angry again...again...again..."

"event","dear______,

i'm going to tell you what i really want, though you may not even bother to listen. and if you will spare me the chance, just spare me once, and listen. because i mean this-
    i just want to be loved the right way. but i know its never possible because i'm expecting the love i see in the movies-the ones where the boy always comes back in the end and falls in love with the girl. but i know it will never happen because people are always leaving, always changing. 
         i want a boy who loves me so much, but doesn't need to say it for me to believe it. i want a boy who thinks with his heart and writes his thoughts with his blood but not the literal way that you're probably thinking.
    i want to find importance, somewhere, anywhere. i want to know it, and breathe it. i want to feel how i feel and not have to worry about it.
    i want to take good pictures, and write well, so you can see it and be proud. because i don't really have much to offer, and the only thing i have is not really there anymore.
    i want people to respect me. not pretend to, not say they do, but really have respect for me. because i feel a little bit more worthy when they do. and the same with love not the kind of love that sort of disappears, but really exists. it makes it easier to breathe.
    i want to dream what i dream and not have to wake up in the morning with death squeezing through my windowpanes. 




i want you to read all of this.
(if you care)
because this is me, and what i want.
and what i'll never get.


love, 
the girl
who will always
be waiting."

"event","i want to get lost in my dreams and never wake up to reality
i think ive lost my mind
i feel like just jumping out my widow and spinning in the grass until i fall, then just lie there and look up at the sky and be free.
im sick of lying
i want to stop complaining about shit, and just have fun.
i want to be nicer to my friends, even if they don't deserve it."

"event","My friends tell me I'm a walking illness.

I tell myself I'm digging my own grave.


These boys tell me that I'm pretty...pretty gruesome.

I like it that way though.

We named our children after towns 
That we've never been to. 
And it's true that the clouds just hunger around 
Like black Cadillacs outside a funeral. 
And we were laughing at the stars 
While our feet clung tight to the ground. 
So pleased with ourselves 
For using so many verbs and nouns. 

But we were all still just dumb, dumb, dumber 
Than the dirt, dirt, dirt on the ground. 


 

I will never understand my mother's mind.
Probably because she doesn't have one.
Or that she lacks the ability to understand the words that come out of my mouth or meaning behind them.
She is like a gun, once you pull the trigger you can't stop the bullet from killing something.
Geezus."

"event","Let's just stop being two-faced and grow up, ok? If you want something, grow up enough to know what you have to sacrifice to get it... stop stretching every limb towards a different ledge.


I want ..[to know.. am I stupid, blind, or should I really just keep trusting what ends up slapping me in the face?]

Of course. I'm not perfect... I have rough edges... I've decided to just not try sanding them off too much anymore.

I wish I had some stupid survey to put up, so that I could read the answers so selfishly.. hoping that I would see what I still want to believe as a 'fact' and read too far into things as I have always done. 


At the same time... I want to be slapped, and snapped out of this limbo.
This week has been terrible. The last few months have been terrible I suppose.... If I look at it retrospectively my life hasn't been too much of a .. hmm.. what is a good word? [what really is a 'good' word in our language..Love certainly isn't.. wars have been started because of thing so juvenille as mistaken love]... well I'll stick 'blooming flower' in there for the time being... that suits the purpose well enough.
Of course there's been good, but even with the presence of a few goods the majority of evil is far from blotted out. 

Wow...just look at how I write sometimes... I don't know why any of you people even read this. 
I'm weird, strange, odd, lonely, nerdy, geeky, lazy, idiotic, cowardly, devastated, broken, fading, bruised, ignorant, bull-headed, far too gullible, weak-minded, dirty, pathetic, trapped, fooled, used, a fall-back plan, too forgiving, stepped on, slapped, crazy, uneasy, easy, juvenille, blasphemous, sinful, and regretful. 

I'm just me... and you know[YOU BLOODY KNOW!!!].. you need to decide, to yourself first, and then to me.. if you're going to take it or leave it. 
Decide fast."

"event","Remember when we thought we were in love? Certainty had never come so quickly. What a fool I was, and what a fooler you remain. All the nights spent sleepless and alone...all the tears and time...all the TIME. I cannot mourn, for it has taught me well...Everything I know about loving with one foot out the door I learned from you.

No feelings of warmth and comfort fill me upon remembering you now...only a pale sense of indifference. There was never any love--only fear and desperation. A search for alleviation. My wasted heart gave in and grew up. You were just a dream, and I a lonely dreamer.

I grew tired of being run over...I wonder if you'll ever get tired of running..."

"event","Another day. Another perfectly wasted day.

I feel like i'm hiding so many secrets - deny deny deny.
I've never been one to react as people would expect in shit situations. I don't know what happens - and i don't know where there's feeling's run off to - i just know that i feel like i'm stepping out of my body. Sometimes i can feel myself 'acting' just so i actually look like i'm not completely cold-hearted...
Maybe the belated emotions are the outburst of tears that come out every now and than for no present reason...? It's like raincheck! Here i come - mouldy old baggage coming through !

PS. I was thinking lastnight how i missed my more sociable and laughable totally less-serious side. I haven't been this girl in a while ..."

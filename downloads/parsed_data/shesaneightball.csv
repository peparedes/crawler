went to the mall with ronnie yesterday. was pretty fun. we saw starsky and hutch. i'm sorry to the people who liked it, but i hated it. i thought it was pretty much just stupid. there were like two funny parts and that was it.. the rest was just boring. it was pretty pointless. so yes. but other than that i had fun. but then i saw Thirteen with my mom and dad. now that movie is pretty sick. it made me think a lot, which is ok. it's just, they showed a lot of things i would have rather not seen. but it was pretty good. it almost made me want to cry... hmm... ccd tonight. meagan and i are actually excited to go!! haha anyways. i don't really have anything else to talk about.

"event","well, i almost died today.
jessica was driving.
we dropped melissa off at work, and i was already scared.
jessica doesn't stop until she's about 2 inches away from the car infront of her.
and she doesn't look where she's driving.
she doesn't signal.
it's scary as hell.

so we were on our way home..
and we were pulling down the alley..
jessica said she didn't want to pull it into the garage..
we should have believed her..
she started out okay..
and then she almost hit my brothers car..
but then she smoothed it out..
but then... she... didn't put on the break..
so we almost had a bigger kitchen..
she hit the wall, and THEN slammed on the breaks..
i swear, she has no common scence...

i am never getting in the car with her ever again.
my mom said we were going to get lunch, and i was afraid to ask if we were driving there..
cause... i am NOT getting in the car if she's driving... no way..

i drive better than she does.
and she has a permit..
that's sad..
and very scary..

*shudders*

on a lighter note, jon comes home in 6 days!
it's still too long, but at least it's getting shorter.
<b>i miss my baby</b> =(

well, my mom is taking a shower, and then i'm not sure what we're doing.
either my mom and i are going to the Allen Outlet Mall, or we're getting lunch.
i hope jessica doesn't drive.......
i hope jessica doesn't go with us if we go to the AOM.. cause.. i really don't need that.
OH WOW.
i forgot my pill.
Gotta go take that.

Welps, talk to everyone later.
This Spring Break isn't too much of hell, but i miss jon.

"event","haha sorry, i forgot to talk about yesterday!
well, we woke up at 6:45.
(that was jessica's idea.. rahr i was in the middle of a good dream)
but we got ready and then left at 7 for my uncles farm.
it took two hours to get there, but we had fun in the car.
melissa, my mom and i were singing old songs that we remember from when we were little.
and we talked and stuff. so it was a good trip there.
then when we got there, we opened the gate thing and drove in.
Jackie, my cousin, came out on the four-wheeler, and drove melissa and i to the farm.
i KNEW melissa was going to love it. i had already been on them before, but she hadn't.
it was sooo muuchhh funnn......
there were horses, cows, goats, donkeys, cats, dogs.. so many animals.
my favorite animals were Bandit the little Yorkie!! Taylor the poodle, Gizmo (gizzy) the Yorkie, and the cats! haha i love big dogs too, cause they had Spud, Lady, and Rocky.. but they didn't like people very much, and they were kind of independent. and whenever i would go to pet bandit, or taylor, they would just jump on me or hit in me in the face. i got scratched a few times.

pretty much all of us got a sunburn. haha my face is a lovely shade of pink. but it was worth it.
we rode around on the 4-wheelers pretty much all day long, out in the beautiful sun.
but, my favorite 4-wheeler kept shutting off.... i don't know why, i think jessica burned out the motor because she would never shift!!! she didn't know how to, and she never cared to ask me..

so melissa and i were out on the two 4-wheelers.. she was on the one that still worked.. but then all of the sudden the one i was on stopped.. so we kept trying to get it going.. and we got SO close, but it stopped again. so melissa pressed the start button and the gas, and i was behind it pushing it. my arms hurt like a moe!!! man, that thing was heavy. my arms are so sore.. but we eventually got it going, so melissa drove off, and then i jumped on the other one and followed. but then it stopped again. so i got behind it, pushed again, and it went. she kind of ran over my toe, but i didn't care, it was going! so she got it back to the farm, and i got on the other one again and drove after her. then we just left them there and decided not to go anymore.

but before, when they WERE working.. we went around the tanks, and theres a lot of low bushes and stuff, and i got smacked in the face with a thorny branch, and it scraped below my eye.. and my arms got cut up a little bit. haha and one of their cats was trying to get my mountain dew out of my hand. the cat was sitting on my lap, and then he just jumped for my hand but scratched it. and then later, he wanted back up on my lap, but he just like put his legs on my leg, and his claws just dug into my leg and i was like AHH!!!!! haha but then he just jumped on me and kept clawing for my mountain dew.

at night, my uncle jack went up on the roof with my brother to look for coyotes to shoot. i went up also cause it looked like fun.  we just sat up there for at least an hour or so.  the sky was awesome.  we just layed down on the roof and talked for a while. we didn't hear any coyotes, and my uncle figured that all the 4-wheeling we did that day kinda scared em off. so we got back down off the roof.  jessica wouldn't go back down the ladder, little scaredy cat. so my uncle had to get his tractor, put her in the bucket thing, and slowly bring her down... she got up there, i dont know why she couldnt get down. oh well, it looked like fun being in the bucket! haha

melissa and jessica rode the horses, but i didn't want to. i'm not a horse person. i did brush one though, and there was alittle miniature horse that i sat on. jackie, my cousin, kept kicking it so it would start running with me on it and i was sitting there going AHH!!!!!!! the whole time.. but it was funny. it was my size pony =) haha

well, that is what i did yesterday. and it was fun.

now im going to go find something to do.

"event","well, i woke up today and didn't do much.
then my mom, brother, and i went to sonic to get some lunch.
then we came home and i got some better shoes.
then my brother and i went to the jasper parking lot
and he taught me how to drive a stick.
it was awesome, and i must say i did pretty well.

i stalled it once, and then one time he told me to just so i would know what it felt like.
but i had fun. i got up to third gear, cause well it's a parking lot.
how fast can you go in a parking lot? plus the stretch in the parking lot wasn't too long.
but it was pretty cool. so now I can drive a stick.
i want to go to jon's house and get his mustang, so i can drive that one.
that's also a stick. he's out of town, and i'm taking care of his house.
i could go get the keys and go drive it, but i wouldn't do that.
i'd feel bad taking someones car while they're not home.....
but maybe when he gets back i can show him that i can drive a stick.
it's fun! i thought i was going to stall it at least 5 times, but i only did it once!

awesome.

anyways, i am pretty damn bored right now, so i'm gonna go find something to do.
catch ya later

i miss him already, i really don't want him to go.
i started getting teary-eyed when we dropped him off at his house after school.
and now for some reason i'm extremely depressed and i feel like crying forever.
i don't want jon to go to florida. i know it's his grandparents 50th anniversary..
but i want him here.. yeah yeah, it's selfish. but i've waited to see him..
and wednesday didn't work out.. thursday didn't work out.. and he's still packing today.
so i haven't gotten to just spend time with <i>him</i> before he goes..
*sigh* whha.. i want him here right now. i just want to be able to be with hhiimm..

i'm also extremely hungry. i wanted chinese food, but my mom seemed to disregard my idea.
so i said i won't eat. but i'm insanely starving. there's nothing else that sounds good right now.
besides China Sun... i really want it... but i don't think anyone in my family will drive all the way over there just for me. so that's out of the question.. but i still want it.

i feel like crying, so i guess i will.

"event","well wow.. yesterday after school in the car... my mom told me that if i wanted to keep melissa as a friend, i was going to have to be nicer to her. now.. i had no clue i was  being mean..? so.. she kept yelling at me.. and i was yelling back.. and then i almost started crying... but melissa got in the car, and my mom kept giving me this evil eye so i just said ""MOM stop looking at me"".. and i had called her a bitch in the earlier fight.. so we dropped viv and melissa off at home... and then on the way home to my house, my mom was yelling at me more, telling me how horrible i am, and how horrible i make people feel, and how such a bad person i am.. and all this.. and telling me all my faults, and how i cant keep friends.. and how i piss everyone in my family off... so i burst in to tears, you know... i think anyone probably would have, too... and then when we got home, i jumped out of the car because it was actually to a stop... i slammed the van door, got yelled at for that.. ran inside, and tried to slam that door, but it didnt work... ran to my room, slammed my door, locked it.. and just fell to the floor crying...    after a while i started doing my homework trying to get my mind off it... my mom came to my room yelling at me to open the door... so i did even though i would have rather kept her out of my room... and she came in yelling at me again... and i never stopped crying from the first time.. so she just made it worse. last night, i hated my mom. i hated her. completely. i wanted to get rid of her for how she made me feel. she kept yelling at me, and i told her ""go away! leave me alone! get out of my room!"" but she wouldnt get her big butt out... and eventually she brought my dad into my room.. and made me feel even MORE like shit because i like my dad. i really do. my mom on the other hand.. pshh.. but she turned my dad against me... so now my whole family pretty much hates me... and she kept bringing up things from a long time ago that i did wrong... and she said i use my depression as an excuse. i dont use it as one, but because i have it, i do these things. i cant control my attitude no matter how hard i try... i could keep telling myself to smile, but it only makes me want to cry. i cant control a thing i do. and she got mad at me for not talking to melissa in the morning. ITS MORNING. IM TIRED. SHE KNOWS I DONT GET SLEEP. so theyre blaming it all on me, when i cant help it!! she says i ignore melissa... lately, shes been the one ignoring me. in the mornings she usually comes in my room, checks her email.. does her hair, or tells me stuff.. but now, she just comes in, puts her backpack down, and leaves to go into the kitchen, or go borrow my moms straightener in her bathroom... so she's been leaving me. i never told her to do that. and I DONT THINK I EVER EVEN GAVE HER THAT IDEA. my whole family, and jessica think ive been different lately. well, i'm on a new medication, what the fuck do you expect to happen? geez... they all expect me to be this little angel, all sweet, talking to everyone, laughing and all this shit. BUT I CANT DO IT. so they might as well just back off and leave me alone.... so pretty much now, my whole life is over.

my mom hates me
my dad hates me
my bro hates me
melissa hates me
jessica hates me (the feeling is mutual)
God probably hates me
Jesus probably wishes he didn't take my sins away
and i'm pretty sure that there is a hell of a lot of people at school who hate me.

notice i didn't say that jon hates me. i think he's probably the only one who loves me.
or can stand me.
either way, i love him xtrillion for that.

so now i have to go finish getting ready to have another day full of shit.


i swear my life is over...

"event","Charlie (my dog) is running around the house like a nutcase... Something is wrong with him. We think that he got into some kind of pills or something 'cause he is <b>not</b> normal. In the car on the way home from school he kept running to the front seat, then darting to the back of the car, and then in the middle, and then the back, and then the front. He was going psycho! It's very scary 'cause he's not like that. geez. It makes me so nervous and it really irritates me when he won't calm down.

anyways....... This weekend I'm going on a church retreat to SkyRanch. It's only until Sunday, but I kind of don't want to go.  But Meagan is going, and I can't leave her alone, and she'll keep me sane. So it's okay I guess. Two days and three nights can't kill me, right?

Yeah I know I haven't updated this in forever, but then again no one ever reads it anyways. It makes me sad how when I go to read my friends' journal, they have 10+ comments, and I have zero. And when they post pictures, they have even MORE comments, and it's all people being jealous of other people, and wanting what they don't have and all that...... sounds kind of mushy, though.

My friend who lives in Boston bought me these shoes that aren't in Texas, and she sent them to me, and I just got them and YAY! I like them =D very comfy.. mmhmm yes they are.

I am going to wear them tomorrow! And then I am going to feel so cool, and everyone will admire me, and they will think so much of me that they will STOP BLOCKING THE HALLWAYS and let me pass, and STOP BLOCKING MY LOCKER and let me get to it....... =) I wish. hah!

Adrienne, my friend from Boston, put a lot of tape on the package when she sent it. haha and it says ""tape.. tape.. so much tape!!"" haha I had fun opening it. and then it was in an American Eagle box... and then inside that, it was wrapped in a paper towel!! Haha, she's so funny =)

she and i have been friends since even before we were born! My mom knew her mom while they were pregnant with us.. and then Adrienne was born 7 days before me. So when I was born, we were already friends. It's awesome. But she's moved a lot. Like, 3 times? I think? Something like that. Her dad lives down the alley from me, just on the street over. But her parents are divorced.. So she comes to visit sometimes. And she came down like.. last week? or something? And I skipped a day *GASP!* and hung out with her. Hehe it was funnn. And then when she had to go home, I just walked her down the alley, haha.

<font size=16>AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! CHARLIE'S BARKING!</font>

DEAR LORD ABOVE THAT SCARED ME!
whew... sheesh.

well, I will try to update more. and maybe with some pictures! if only i was purdy. =(


See ya'll 'round later.

"event","hmm. not much has been up lately.
just got home from school, and imma starvin'!
i went to my psychiatrist yesterday after school.
that wasn't too fun.
got a new medication, that i doubt will work.
but man, i cried so much that day.
i was on the border of having my mom send me to C Center.
and i do <b>not</b> want to go there.
that's a hospital by the way, for people with mental problems.
and depression, im guessing, is a mental problem.
so my mom wanted to send me there, so did the doc.
but luckily i talked my mom out of it.

anyways.. i am going to go get a bagel.
that sounds good to me.. mmm mmm mmm.

oh, in p.e. the other day, this Danny kid molested me with a hockey stick.
that was gross. he did it to other girls too, but not as bad.
it's gross. he kept like going up my leg with it, and hitting me in the butt.
i was trying to play hockey, but its hard with that happening.
extremely uncomfortable. <b>extremely</b>

and i got made fun of MORE for how short i am.
i like being short, but i don't like being made fun of.
and i was being goofy, not ditzy, but goofy.
and they kept making fun of me.
and i kept going along with it, because i don't care.
and then Ravi hit me on the head with a meter stick.
so now people love to hurt me.
he was kidding though. but yeah, i hit him back.

and ricky moved!!! :(
rahr. he was in my german class.
he always pissed off Frau Ernst, and even though i love her to death,
it was still really funny.
he's a goofball. and i am going to miss him.
and i will feel very lonely without him there.
he was the only one (besides jon) who said being short is good.

anyways. wasn't i going to make a bagel or something?
right!
well, i'll be going.
auf wiedersehen.

<b>ich liebe dich, Jon!</b>

yesterday my mom and i went shopping with mrs. zimmer, and her mom.
we went to Joanns crafts, Foley's and then the low carb store.
then we dropped my mom off at home, and went by to pick up jon.
he was at a friends house working on a project for school.
but no one answered the door.. so we went home.
and mrs. zimmer and i spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out the number.
we looked at the caller id and tried matching the times to the number.
and then we went to whitepages.com and tried getting a number from the address.
but then he called! lol so we went to pick him up.
and then we went and got mcdonalds, and then we ate that and watched tv.
and then at 6:37 or so, we went to see Along Came Polly.
and then we came home around 8 or so, and hung out.
and then i came home around 10:50 or something.

and then today.. my mom and i went to Chilis.
and we got me some Brocolli Cheese Soup to go, because i love it.
and then we went to Kohl's and bought some stuff on sale.
and then we went to Walmart to get some sweat pants
cause my mom is going to hemn them for me and make them capris! woop!
and now we are home. well, i am. my mom went somewhere.
i'm eating skittles and im thinking about calling jon.

"event","well, i am officialy $60 richer.
after school, my mom dropped melissa and i off at her house.
and then we kind of hung out for a few minutes.
but then her dad took us to wendys for dinner
and then we went to Fieldwork Dallas.
well, it was in Dallas, it was in some huge building.
and then we went in there, filled out a paper thing,
and sat down from 5:55-6:30. that was kinda boring.
we were the first ones,  but then other people started showing up.
the last 3 times melissa had done these survey things,
she never got picked to go in and talk.
they ""always over-book"" so they send one group home.
and we were the group to go home.
so we sat there till around 7, then we got $60 each,
and left.

it wasn't all that bad. we were talking while we were waiting,
and even though i don't know melissa's dad that well,
he laughed at my jokes or whatever,
and that made me feel better.
we were quoting Office Space. haha that was great.
""but..that's my stapler.. don't take my stapler.""
""i...i'm going to burn down the building...""
""no, you moved me last time, and i said i didnt want to move.""
""Uuummmm.....Yyyyeaaaahhhhh.... That'll be ggrreaaaattt....""

haha best movie. well, not best. its kinda weird at some parts,
but its still hillarious.

3 day weekend!!!!!!! <b>HELL YES, YO!</b>

i'm hoping that after school today, my mom will take me and melissa to plano sports.
we don't know if its going to be open or not, but she's going to call today.
and we get to take jon home! yay! i get to see my baby!!!! <3333 <b> =D </b>

my dogs don't like me much either.
i don't have a lot of friends.
the only person i actually want to hang out with and be with every single day of my life is jon.
but i can't have that.
i do like being with melissa too, don't get me wrong. i just LOVE jon, love him.
melissa is just me sister/friend. so i love her differently than that.
but man... i have no purpose in life.
i swear i just want to cry all day long today.

All I want for Christmas
Is you...

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you...
You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You...

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need - 
won't you please bring my baby to me...

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You...

All I want for Christmas is you baby...

"event","today was sort of busy, so let's see if i remember it all.

algebra and ipc exams. algebra sucked cause joey was there. i hate seeing him or being near him.
ipc was ok. i think i failed. but other than that, it seemed ok.
after that, went to the car. melissa, jon, and stephen came. we went to mcdonalds for lunch.
after we ate, melissa and i went and played in the play place.
then stephen and jon went and played with these little basketballs and a net they have.
melissa and i joined. and then i went and climbed up the slide.
jon threw a basketball up, and i would catch it in the slide and throw it back down.
then stephen did the same thing, but he hit me in the face with it. it hurt.
my face was stinging for a while. but its ok now. just kinda burned.
then we were playing knock-out, which is very hard since the net and the space we had was very tight.
then stephen like threw the ball but it hit me right in the back of the neck, and it hit my spinal cord.
i guess it was in just the right place, cause i kinda blacked out for a few seconds.
he kept saying he was sorry, and i kept trying to take the attention away from me.
i said it was ok, and it really was. i didnt want to make him feel bad.

after that, my mom came and got us. we dropped jon off at his house.
stephen came over, but only for like 5 minutes. melissa and i were showing him my webcam.
haha he was being goofy though, trying to fly on the webcam.
then we took him home, and went to melissa's house to get these coupons for Kohl's.
then we came back home. later, my dad took melissa and i to Kohl's.
i thought we'd only be there for like 30 minutes to an hour.
we ended up staying there for 2 and a half hours.
my feet were killing me, and they still are. my legs are sore.
i bought a shirt for me, and a shirt for my mom. i hope my mom likes it =|
melissa was being pretty picky.... so it took a long time.
then finally we paid, and left. we took melissa home.
she said she didn't need her backpack, so she'd pick it up in the morning.
but by the time my dad and i got home, my brother and his gf were home too, and melissa was with them.
i was in my room and she walked in and i was like ""....hello...""
she got her backpack, and then asked to borrow my black sweats. so i let her, but i was still confused.
we could have brought her back over to pick it up, but she said she didn't need it...
i dunno.. just confusing...

i hate being a girl at these times in the month.. i hate it, <b>hate it, <i>hate it.</i></b>

well, my feet are almost dead, my legs hurt like a bia, and i am tired beyond tired.
i'm gonna pick out my clothes for tomorrow, get ready for bed, and then i'm crashing.

<b>i love jon so incredibly completely amazingly godly much</b>

and then we dropped jon at his house. i went to my doctor appt. and he went to his ortho appt.
then afterwards, he called my house and picked me up on his way home.

"event","exams today.. that sucks. but i have the easy ones today. art and health. woop woop. and my health coach told us we could bring in movies for after the exam, so i'm bringing some. it was hard finding PG movies in my house.. we have PG13 and R.. but not many PG. so the ones i chose are kinda dumb. Home Alone 1-3, Flubber, Babys Day Out, Casper. what crap huh? yeah. oh well.

and then after school, i get to go to jon's house. shibbyness! =] =] =] yay for that!!!
my mom said on wednesday i have a doctors appt, but that jon could go with me.
he'd be bored, but i do want to see him. guess i'll ask him today.
i'm wearing jeans but i brought some comfy pants in my backpack just incase.

k i need to finish getting ready.
peace out yo.

<b>i love jon like WHOAH</b>

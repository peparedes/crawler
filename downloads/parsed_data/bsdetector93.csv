<b>Child abuse works both ways.</b> The following questions may help you to determine whether you are an adult victim of children.

Do others fail to recognize your accomplishments because they are busy with their babies?

Do you feel that if people really liked you, they would stop creating other people that they like more than you?

Do friends rudely and unfairly interrupt conversations about you to yank their children away from burners, outlets or knives? When they do, do you want to kill them?

Do you find that many of your friends are more interested in their children than in you?

Do you find yourself nauseated by that weird baby smell?

Do babies make you want to puke?

Do you feel that, honestly, you are cuter than most babies?

Do you fly into uncontrollable rages at the sight of little tiny socks?

Do you ever wonder what would happen if you dropped an infant off the Empire State Building?

Have you ever said the following:

""How old is it?""

""Does it ever shut up?""

""How can you stand that weird baby smell?""

If you answered yes to three or more of the above questions, <b>you are a PRIC</b> (<b>P</b>erson who is <b>R</b>epulsed and <b>I</b>rritated by <b>C</b>hildren) , and you are not alone."

"event","After 6 years and 4 months as an Empowerism member, I feel that I can be of help. Please trust that what I am about to say is not meant to be intimidating, chastising, or otherwise harsh to you or anyone reading this. I am going to lay down some of the truths about Empowerism and how you can succeed. In the process, I am going to eliminate any excuse that you or anyone else may have for not succeeding in Empowerism. The only obstacle to success that I cannot eliminate is YOU. Hopefully, when I am finished, you will come to realize that success or failure in Empowerism is totally up to YOU.

Empowerism has done its part. Empowerism and its leadership has done whatever necessary since 1998 to make itself a thriving business in order to provide each of us an opportunity to capitalize on. The leadership of Empowerism developed an attitude of mental toughness and since the beginning became blind to ALL obstacles. Every business has its dark days. Empowerism has not been immune to those; however, it has done whatever necessary to survive and become successful. YOU need to adopt the same attitude!<lj-cut text=""Tell me more, Ray!"">

YOU have to become a believer in Empowerism and YOURSELF! Then, you share that belief. To become a believer, you need to become a student of the business. I can tell when someone is not a student of the business as soon as I hear them pose questions regarding the $19.95 per month dues as in your case. If you were a student of this business you would not have to question the $19.95 (from here on $20).

What is Empowerism? What are you paying for? Is it worth it? The answers and perspective I am about to give are not mystical or magical. I only have to look to the Empowerism Member Center for the answers (something that most people never do).

For a moment, let's forget the fact that you can make money with Empowerism.

Empowerism is not just a network marketing group. Empowerism is the premiere Computer and Internet Training Center on the World Wide Web. Did you know that though millions of people join the Internet every year, most of them have a difficult time powering down their computer? The majority of the Internet population is still computer or Internet ILLITERATE. It is amazing that nearly everything that anyone could want to know about the internet or even the operation of their computer is taught by Empowerism in the Member Center of each member's Empowerism website.

What are you paying for? A Membership with benefits on 5 levels.

Level 1: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced Computer Operation. Everything you need to know to operate your computer and to use the Internet. How to power your computer off and on. How to use Windows and Window Explorer. How to use your mouse buttons. How to read and use computer menus and sub-menus. How to create folders,  download files, find files in Windows Explorer, open Zip files, copy pieces of text, paste pieces of text, copy files, paste files in another directory, create shortcuts, change screen resolutions. How to understand and deal with computer hoaxes and viruses. How to set up Internet and email settings. How to select and deal with your Internet Service Provider. Dealing with passwords, email addresses, POP3 Servers, SMTP Servers, FTP, Telnet and NNTP Servers. How to set up Computer and Internet preferences. Email terms, Outlook Express and Netscape Setups, Email security issues, dealing with attachments and email filters, junkmail, privacy, encryption and digital IDS, and web based email. How about SPAM, Plug-Ins and finding free stuff on the Internet? Making web pages. Downloading and sending images. Setting up your printer, using it and making it interact with the Internet and other uses. Newbie Tutorials, Glossaries of Terms, Search Engine use. Beginning, intermediate and advanced Domain Name usage. Beginning, intermediate and advanced HTML and Website Design. How to make and use banners including banner design and exchanges. How to use Mirror and Doorway Pages, Email Marketing and Safelists. All about Auto-Responders. Use of Internet languages including Java, Java script, CGI, Pearl and Cookies and Tracking Tools. I think I have scratched the surface.

How much is all of this worth?

You could pay several thousand dollars for college courses, or you can pay $240 a year for an Empowerism membership; and, unlike college, you can pay it MONTHLY. You can pay an HTML programmer $50-150 an hour to build and maintain yourself a homepage or website, or you can pay a very small Empowerism Membership so you can build and maintain it yourself. I have several websites for my own needs. Just one would have cost me over $12,000 to build and maintain if I would have had it done with someone else. But I built and maintain it myself for my band. I have spent less than $1,500 in six years with Empowerism. Had I not made a dime, this alone was worth it. The fact that I have been able to prevent or recover from computer crashes has been worth every penny spent for my Empowerism Membership. I have not had to pay a computer technician for over 4 years. When I buy a computer I know what I am getting and why because of Empowerism. I can set it up myself, connect to the Internet myself, etc. Viruses can be very costly. Not for me. I learned how to prevent and deal with them because of Empowerism. These are just a few examples of the ""worth"" of Empowerism.

On the business side, and because I became a student of my business (Empowerism) I can communicate with you, answer any of your questions, help you grow and build your business which in turn helps my business grow. I am a believer in the awesome power and knowledge of Empowerism, and I share that belief with others. How much does one have to spend on an education and how much time does one have to spend with a company to work themselves up into a supervisory or ownership capacity with that company? In 6 years with Empowerism it cost me less than $1,500, I worked part time, and I have made money from the first month on and not with just Empowerism. But had I not earned a dime, the preceding paragraph will point out that it was worth the membership fees. Let me point out here that what you have today is worth far greater than what we all had with Empowerism in 1998. All we had was a magazine.

Level 2: The Empowerism Excellence Magazine.

This is all we had for over 2 years with Empowerism. Most people in Empowerism today have not even read it. Too bad. It is chocked full of answers and motivational issues that pertain not just to Internet marketing but to life itself. For 2 years, myself and others built a business with the magazine ALONE. The subscription price is a bit higher than other magazine subscriptions. On the other hand there was none and still is none that provides the insight into Internet marketing that Excellence does. And, you cannot make hundreds or thousands of dollars per month selling subscriptions to Life Magazine or National Geographic. Well, I suppose you can but it is a bit more work. On the other hand the knowledge I gained from that magazine alone was worth the Empowerism membership fee. (If you'd like a copy of the Excellence magazine to review, email me -  Jim)

Level 3: Building a downline of subscribers. 3x9 matrix paying $1 per head on up to nine levels, a $20 fast start bonus for every new subscriber, and $6 per month for each personal subscriber in your matrix.

With Empowerism, you have the opportunity to build a subscriber base that can pay you hundreds or even thousands of dollars every month. THIS IS OVER AND ABOVE THE WORTH of Levels 1 and 2. And now Empowerism offers an automatic prospecting system using the auto-responder to help you build the business. If you have just joined Empowerism in the last few years you have had the luxury of using an automatic system. Prior to that we built our businesses one subscriber at a time through conventional advertising and contact means. Most of my recruiting success has occurred offline. The automatic system is just a PLUS for me. And, I must say that for the last year because of other projects both business and charitable that I have been working on, the auto system has helped maintain my business.

Is the benefit of the Empowerism Opportunity worth 20 bucks a month? It is if you want to be in business. It is about the most affordable way to get into business that I know of. Good Grief! Have you ever tried to start a business? Do you know anyone in business? Is their overhead $20 a month? Are you kidding me? The electric bill alone costs more than that. It costs damn near $20 to set up a garage sale!! If the Level 1 Benefit is worth $20 a month... If the Level 2 Benefit is worth $20 a month... Then surely the Opportunity to be in business is worth $20 a month. If you had been a student of Empowerism, you would have realized that the tax benefits and savings alone for being in a home based business completely wipe out the cost of $20 per month. The fee itself is tax deductible for goodness sakes! It is the cost of doing business. Add to that what you can deduct for home office rent, utilities, advertising, etc. and you will get more of a tax refund than what Empowerism costs. The mileage deductions on your car alone would probably wipe out the cost of Empowerism. So, you make money just by being a member. If you never receive a commission check you are money ahead.

Why do you or anyone else fret the $20 a month? For existing members my general answer is that they are not students of their own business so do not understand that there is in effect NO COST to Empowerism. And sure! Get three people and it is free. It's FREE without 3 people if you consider the above. Forget the FREE! It is worth it without the free aspect.

But an income won't be handed to you - only the opportunity. I say this with some reservation. If you do absolutely nothing, and let the auto-responder work, in time it will be handed to you. Fact is, if you really want to make serious money with your 3x9 matrix, you need to become a student of your own Empowerism business so you can become a BELIEVER, and then share your beliefs and the dream of owning your own business with others.

Why do potential members (your prospects) fret the $20 per month? My general answer is that they have nothing to believe in because the person introducing them to Empowerism (YOU) are not a student, nor a believer, so you have NOTHING to share and NOTHING to believe in. People have to able to believe and they have to believe in you. In the least they have to believe in your enthusiasm. But if you are not a student or believer, you have nothing to offer including enthusiasm. If you offer nothing to believe in, there is no reason for people to join your cause.

A final note in this section... I see so many posts on the Empowerism message board regarding the $20 a month and what a hindrance it is, how people may not be able to afford it, how it stops them from buying leads in RSVP because they have to be a member, and so on and so on. This is nonsense, plain and simple! Once again, you cannot expect to build a business of any type on this planet for an overhead of only $20 a month, not to mention all you get for it. Get your head into your member center. The only group of Americans that cannot afford $20 a month is the homeless. In every household budget in America, including those on welfare, there is $20 a month to become a member of Empowerism which will give the member an opportunity to free themselves from poverty or enhance their already productive life. It is strictly a matter of budget. Do you drink soft drinks or alcohol during the month. Cut back and put it toward Empowerism. Do you smoke? Quit. Are you overweight? Eat less. Do you eat dessert with your meal once a week or more? Quit - there is 8-10 dollars. Junk foods are expensive. One bag of potato chips is 10% of your Empowerism payment. Skip the movie - rent it later when you make money. I ordered 12 pieces of chicken and jojos last night with a medium size pepperoni and sausage pizza, and a 2 liter bottle of diet coke. The cost with tip was $27. Are you a leadfoot?  Drop your speed 5-10 MPH and save 10% on your gasoline. If you only use a tank of gas a month or 20 gallons, you save 2 gallons or nearly $4 at today's prices. Spend half as much this Christmas as you normally do. Cut your thermostat back 5 degrees and save 10$ on your home heating and/or air conditioning bill. Clip coupons. If a person has an income they have $20 per month hidden in their current budget to cut loose. I have never met anyone to the contrary. Sometimes it takes sacrifice. BUT YOU have to give them something to believe in.

Level 4 Benefit: RSVP

RSVP is an extension of the auto-responder system in that you can buy leads over and above the 50 you get each month for your membership fees. These leads are deposited into your auto-responder and the search is on for subscribers. There is a good chance you will eventually get subscribers with these leads automatically. If not and you want them to turn into subscribers - work the leads by email, phone calls or letters. You don't have to work them, and if you do you do not have to work them in mass. How about emailing 1-5 per day until you get some responses? Then establish a relationship with the responses and continue to mail 1-5 a day. If you spent $200 and you bought 400 leads it will take you 3-4 months to work them all. If you get no subscribers (which is physically impossible) so what? Don't whine! By the time you worked through them you got paid $200 by cycling in the RSVP matrix.

I see posts on the message board regarding how to download the leads into another auto-responder after they have been worked by Empowerism's. Of course, not being students of the business, most people will not be able to do that because they do not understand how, nor will they spend money for another auto-responder anyway that costs about as much as Empowerism. What's wrong with just sending out 1-5 letters a day, one at a time with your own email program? What do you say? Assuming you don't know much because you have not dedicated much time to becoming a student of the business but have spent enough time to be a believer, how about...

------------ Hi, I purchased a list of email addresses of persons who expressed interest in an Internet business and you are on the list. I am building a new business on the Internet and would like to communicate with you regarding it if you are serious. Would you mind if we sent a couple of letters back and forth? Maybe we could even talk on the phone?

Best regards, Raymond Clifton

PS: I will remove you from my contact list upon request and I will verify that you requested information regarding Internet business opportunities should you feel it necessary. ------------

RSVP. Are you in it? If not, why not? Probably because you are not a believer. Where else can you spend $25 and have it turn into $2000 in commissions? Not to mention the side benefits of getting additional subscribers. AND the heck with $25 a month. It should be a minimum of $200. $200 a month deposited into RSVP every month will earn you $2000 every month after approximately 30 months, and will earn you from $200 to $1,800 prior to that depending on what month you are in. Not bad for a part time business. And, after your third or fourth month's deposit, you can take the $200 right out of your earnings. Guest what? Find $200 a month for the first 4 months. After that get the $200 out of your earnings and you can look toward a $2,000 per month income for life! Want a $4,000 a month income? Work your way up to depositing $400 a month into RSVP as soon as possible. By the way, work the 400 leads you get each month as above right along side your auto responder. You will never be able to contact that many people. You will need help. Ask a friend to help, then enroll him or her in Empowerism.

I know. Many of you do not have your leads yet? So what? The RSVP commissions are marching on even though the leads are late. Further, I cannot imagine that many of you are even working the 50 you are getting with your monthly membership fee. The leads will come. In the meantime your RSVP commissions are rising. If you just want to make one (1) $200 purchase in RSVP, it will pay you 6-800 this year. So much for the Empowerism monthly fee. We wipe it out again here. Don't have $200? Get it! I don't care if you have to sell your second car and drive your spouse to work. I don't care if you have to sell your living room furniture. Replace it later and sit on the rug for a while. Borrow $10 from 10 people and tell them you won't be able to pay it back for a year. Having a hard time getting subscribers? I will bet they will ask you what it is for when you borrow the $10. Point is, you can do it if you believe it and want it bad enough. And if you don't have $200 you need to do it more than the person who does. Don't pooh pooh and whine. DO IT! Until you do, you will never have the confidence to ask others to join you in your business. If you do not believe, neither will they.

You know? You do not have to work RSVP at all. It is your choice. The $20 per month you spend for your Empowerism membership stands on its own in worth if you have been paying attention. RSVP is just another benefit or bonus.

Level 5 Benefit: MVP

With MVP you can buy ad packages in $100 or 200 increments and be paid 2.5 times that amount back in commissions. You should be doing RSVP and MVP. If you have limited funds, pick the one you like best. To get MVP to pay out as much as RSVP, just repurchase with all or part of your MVP earnings. The point is if you make regular deposits in either or both, your 3x9 matrix business will eventually build and you earn unheard of commissions from RSVP and MVP.

Learn, Teach and Prosper!

Academic free speech is a damn lie. Try 
to discuss & debate Nature's Time Cube 
and your evil teachers will not allow you. 
Ignorance of Time Cube dooms humans, 
 inflicting their own created ""word hell"". 
Educators are actually ""<a href=""www.doom3.zoy.org"">evil word gods</a>"", 
teaching commercial plunder of Nature. 
The damn bastards suppress free speech, 
 by denying Time Cube debate discussion. 
Students MUST DEMAND free speech - 
 for the greatest of all human discoveries: 
Nature's Harmonic Simultaneous 4 Day 
Rotating Creation Principle of Cubicism.

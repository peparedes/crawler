I don't know why I'm so awful at writing lately.&nbsp; I think I'm just a lazy bastard. lol

Let's see...Abby is getting very big!&nbsp;&nbsp;She is crawling relentlessly, pulling herself up to standing, and really talking a LOT.&nbsp; And she's pretty much the cutest thing in the world right now!&nbsp;&nbsp;It's going to be very interesting to see how she behaves when her little sister or brother is born.

That's right...We're pregnant again!&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a little bit sooner than we had planned, but we're happy.&nbsp; The new baby will be born around August 5, so we have a lot planning to do.

I'm a little over two months away from PCSing to Ft. Meade and joining the Field Band.&nbsp; I'm really excited about it, and a bit nervous.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't want to get up there and do a poor job and have my bosses think they made the wrong choice.&nbsp; I'm sure that's just natural with any new job, but it's still there!&nbsp;&nbsp;

We're in the process of looking for houses in that area.&nbsp; We got approved for a VA&nbsp;Loan and found a realtor.&nbsp; We'll be meeting with her the second week of February and hopefully we can nail something down that we really like and can afford.

The week before that, though, I'll be going to Texas with the Jazz Band for a little tour.&nbsp; I hope that we come together and put on some great shows.&nbsp; Nothing worse than a bad Jazz concert!&nbsp;lol&nbsp; I'm looking forward to it, but I'm sad to leave Erin alone for a week.&nbsp; 

This past Tuesday we traded in our 2003 Honda Civic for a brand spanking new 2009 Honda Accord.&nbsp; It's blue and awesome... We really wanted to get the Odyssey, but the payments were just too high.&nbsp; We had to haggle for a lower monthly payment, but we got it down to a respectable amount.&nbsp; We were spoiled by my old payments cuz I got a KILLER&nbsp;deal on that car, but we'll make due.

So, from Tuesday&nbsp;through the next eight months, we have/will have a new:
1. President (woot!)
2. Car
3. House
4. Job
5. Baby

wow...that's a lot of change in a short amount of time!&nbsp;&nbsp;But everything is very exciting and I look forward to see what else 2009 has in store for us!

I hope you're all doing well.&nbsp; Rest assured that I have been keeping tabs on all of you."

"event","Well, it might be bigger than little.
I'll try to bring everyone up to speed on my life over the past few months!

Little Abigail is six months old now!
she's getting so big!&nbsp;&nbsp;She's cut two teeth, she's babbling incessantly, and she's on the verge of crawling.
I'm more and more amazed by her everyday.

On August 29th, I&nbsp;finally got to go to a promotion board!
I&nbsp;was nervous as hell... I didn't know if I had studied nearly enough!
I&nbsp;was third to go, so the waiting KILLED me...
However, once I&nbsp;finally got in the room, it was ALL&nbsp;business.
CSM&nbsp;James asked me some facing movements then told me to sit down.&nbsp; Said a few words and asked me to recite the Soldier's Creed.
I&nbsp;stood and belted that thing out loud and proud!&nbsp;&nbsp;When I&nbsp;finished, CSM&nbsp;said &quot;Man, Gunderson!&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought you were gonna crawl across this table and kill me!&quot;
haha
Then he asked me if I&nbsp;knew the NCO&nbsp;Creed, which I&nbsp;said I&nbsp;did.
So I stood and recited it with one small glitch.
CSM&nbsp;then proceeded to &quot;lecture&quot; me on cutting my grass. HAHA&nbsp;
That was funny.
And then it was OVER!
The board didn't ask me a SINGLE&nbsp;QUESTION...?!?!&nbsp;What?!
crazy

So, I leave to go back to the band hall. &nbsp;I'm just sitting on my computer at work waiting until I&nbsp;have to go to PAC&nbsp;and take my promotion packet over.
In the mean time, I&nbsp;get an email from the US&nbsp;Army Field Band which contained a message inviting me to interview for the Assistant Librarian position there, which I&nbsp;had applied to earlier that week.
I&nbsp;was shocked!&nbsp;Two great things happened to me on the same day?!&nbsp;
CRAZY!
so, Erin and I&nbsp;went out to dinner that night...alone!&nbsp; Our friend Andrea watched Abby for us, and we had a lovely time, just sitting, talking, laughing, eating, and drinking a very nice Riesling.

SO...
Fast-forward to Tuesday.
I&nbsp;drive up to Ft. Meade, MD for the interview on Wednesday.
I&nbsp;get to the hotel that the Field Band put me up in...
NICE&nbsp;hotel!&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a suite... I&nbsp;had a sitting room, a KITCHEN, the whole nine yards.
Well, I&nbsp;took it easy, watched some tv, read a little bit, got some dinner.
And of course, knowing that it would be a big day tomorrow, I&nbsp;went to bed early...
AND
DIDN'T
SLEEP!!
ACK!

Don't you hate that crap!?
Oh man, I&nbsp;just couldn't fall asleep!&nbsp;It was horrible.
so my alarm goes of Wednesday morning and I feel like CRAP.
But I&nbsp;get up, shower, eat some breakfast, and meet the other applicants at the front door so we can be driven to the interview.

There were only three of us accepted this far:&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl was from the Mannheim band and&nbsp;a guy from Ft. Riley.
So we get to the Field Band.
We get a mini-tour.
Then we take a WRITTEN&nbsp;test...ACK!&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn't know about that!&nbsp;I&nbsp;would've studied more!&nbsp;haha
but for the most part it was horrible.&nbsp; Just some answers I&nbsp;didn't remember, no big deal, right? 
heh...
I&nbsp;was nervous as crap...this was NOT a good sign... I&nbsp;should KNOW these answers.
Anyways, then we go into some scenarios...the librarian asked us things like &quot;ok, so-and-so wants to borrow this piece...&quot;
and so I&nbsp;asked her, &quot;well, do we own the piece?&nbsp;is it in print?&nbsp;did someone here compose it?&quot; yada yada yada.
and various other questions were asked... &quot;who owns the copyright to 'Feliz Navidad?'&quot; amongst others..
wow

then came the interviews!
we called in one by one.
I&nbsp;went last.
I was surrounded by five people who bombarded me with all sorts of questions...
&quot;What do you think some of the short-comings of our library are?&quot;
&quot;Are you intimidated by rank?&quot;
&quot;What do you think about modularity in our field?&quot;
&quot;Explain your biggest challenge you had to overcome in the army.&quot;

man, it was brutal, but the were all great questions.

so, we all completed that and Sergeant Major Martin called us in to a side room.
He informed us that two people were advancing:&nbsp;SSG&nbsp;Miles...and myself.

Now we had to go through another interview...with the Commander of the Field Band, COL&nbsp;Palmatier.
zoinks!

So, SSG&nbsp;Miles went first.
was only in there about 3 minutes

Now it's my turn
I&nbsp;walk in
COL&nbsp;asked me one simple question:&nbsp;&quot;Why do you want this job?&quot;
So I&nbsp;told him about me experience and my passion and my commitment.
He said &quot;you know there is no side door into my ensemble, right?&nbsp;You will not be&nbsp;a player...are you ok with that??&quot;
and I&nbsp;of course said, &quot;absolutely...I&nbsp;had resigned myself to that fate once, and I'm more than willing to do it again.&quot;

so I&nbsp;left the room.
the SGM&nbsp;came back and said &quot;ok, let's go to lunch!&quot;

UGH!!
I&nbsp;was mad!
making us wait like that!

so we went to a chinese buffet, a favorite of all Army Bandsmen. lol
and we chatted
and stewed!

got back to the field band and the SGM&nbsp;called the two remaining candidates into his office.
And he says &quot;you should both be proud of yourselves so far; you're both great candidates for this position.&nbsp; However, we've decided to extend the position to...SPC&nbsp;Gunderson.&quot;

*blink blink*

what?

excuse me?

You meant SSG&nbsp;Miles right?!

HOLY CRAP!
I'm going to be joining the FIELD&nbsp;BAND in&nbsp;about six months or so!!!
This is GREAT!

I&nbsp;was so pumped and excited I&nbsp;didn't know what to say!
I&nbsp;was told to go talk to CSM&nbsp;Keller, so I&nbsp;walked through a haze of disbelief and chatted with him for awhile.
I&nbsp;FINALLY&nbsp;got to leave and get back to my car at the hotel at 4pm so that I&nbsp;could call my nervous-as-hell wife, Erin, and tell her the news!&nbsp;She had been pacing back and forth all day, poor thing!

so...
yeah!
that's my story and I'm sticking to it!
I&nbsp;know most of you know the story already, but for those of you that don't....there it is!
I'll be an E-5 next month.
then I'll be an E-6 in a few months, once I&nbsp;join the Field Band!

thanks for taking the time to read.
Sorry I don't post that much anymore. I&nbsp;know I&nbsp;used to be an avid poster.
I guess I'm just a lazy bastard!&nbsp;:-P

peace out, yallz"

it's been like...a&nbsp;decade since I last posted anything of&nbsp;significance.&nbsp; I will attempt to do so now, but it might be a bit rambly and nonsensical.

For the record, just because I don't post doesn't mean I don't READ.&nbsp; I try to&nbsp;read through my&nbsp;friends page a few times a week and keep up with&nbsp;all your dirty deeds that done dirt&nbsp;cheap...or something...

Things have been a roller coaster here in beautiful ""oh wait, I forgot what f'n SEASON it is"" Southeastern Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The baby time clock is quickly ticking to&nbsp;the inevitable day when me and Erin are&nbsp;no longer the only people occupying our house (aside from our adorable kitties).&nbsp; That's right... my parents-in-law are visiting... Just kidding!
but seriously, little Abigail is due in less than three weeks!&nbsp; I'm gonna be a DAD?! What is THAT all about?!
I'm really nervous but excited at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people probably don't think that I'm that excited about it, but I really am.&nbsp; It'll be amazing to have this little child that I will be&nbsp;responsible for to mold into a decent human being.
Quite a daunting task!
But I know that with the help of my loving and amazing wife, we will be able to provide a house full of love and joy.
March 4 here we come!

Speaking of babies, I have to welcome Evan Hartlieb into the world!&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole's son was&nbsp;born this morning around 4:00 am (what a LONG day yesterday was!) weighing in at 9 lbs 2 ozs!&nbsp; I can't wait to see him! :-)

Things&nbsp;at work have been crazy.&nbsp; It's been a lot of ups and&nbsp;downs emotionally and musically.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Back in October, we took a PT test, and I scored miserably on it.&nbsp; I passed, but I had the single lowest score in the&nbsp;unit...embarrassing!&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then I was given the info that I wouldn't be eligible for promotion until I got my PT score up.&nbsp; Totally shitty, but them's the breaks.
So, I started working with my friend Angie to get a lot better at everything.&nbsp; I was running&nbsp;all the time, working out, yada yada.&nbsp; Then she gets pregnant and can't work out anymore... BUMMER!&nbsp;
So I try to rework my work out regimen&nbsp;so that I can train for another PT test.&nbsp; &nbsp;I took that test last week...
and I didn't do much better. :-\
I did better, if only slightly, on my push-ups and sit-ups, but worse on the run!&nbsp; I worked REALLY hard on that run, and hardly worked on the other two.&nbsp; I was VERY disappointed.&nbsp; And I'm still not eligible to be promoted.&nbsp; So, I'll have to kick things up another three notches and kill the test in April.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's hard for me though, because working out by myself doesn't quite work.&nbsp; I need someone to pace me or something.&nbsp; Don't know why... But I need to jumpstart this shit and get some f'n respect so that I can keep pace with my peers.

I also have been toying with this whole Officer thing.&nbsp; I've started to take conducting lessons at Old Dominion University from the orchestra director there, Dr. Lucy Manning (who got her DMA from USC...I met her once or twice right before I left for Milwaukee).&nbsp; She actually has me conducting the orchestra in concert, so that's exciting.&nbsp; I just hope I can pull it off without looking like a jackass!
Unfortunately, I'm not able to make an audition tape for the next band officer audition.&nbsp; It's due March 1 and I just have too much crap going on.&nbsp; Plus, I'm not able to have any time with the band here to rehearse, so that didn't work out.
Sooo... I'm hoping that another audition pops up in September or so because I need to do this.&nbsp; If I don't at least try for this, I'll be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life.&nbsp;

what else....??

Man, I don't even know.&nbsp; I just know that my life is going to change forever in the next three weeks, but all for the better.

I hope that you're all doing well, and I hope I can make more frequent updates.&nbsp; I just don't have a drive to write like I used to.&nbsp; Ah well!

Peace out, yallz"

"event","man, I don't know why I've been so bad about updating lately...

what's been going on?
Erin and I have moved on base. the house is really nice and we've got most of our stuff unpacked and in place...sorta...
it's so nice to be able to walk or bike to work 

things at work have been going well. the big summer concert series is over. it's sad in a way cuz it was like having a real gig having to prepare new music every week. but a break from all that is good, too!
next week I have to go to a Combat Life Savers Course at Ft. Eustis. Basically, I get to learn how to give someone an IV and how to get them out of a battlefield without hurting them more. yay! but it's 8 promotion points, so I'll go for it.

I just went to the School of Music in Norfolk today to have a teacher evaluation for a future gig there. They wanted to hear me play a little and then teach an AIT student.
So, I played the beginning of the Copland Concerto. and, amazingly, even to myself, I played the HELL out of it! it was amazing. the high Es were smooth and beautiful, so I'm really happy about that.
Then the teaching part came. The student was decent. Not a horrible player, but had some problems I could address. I talked about tone and tempo, which were the two things that the panel were looking for. 
So, needless to say, I got the recommendation to be a teacher at the school! That's awesome to have for my future in the Army. Options are always good to have in this job!

Other than that, it's just been me and Erin preparing ourselves to be parents! It's still crazy to think that we'll soon be parents! I'm sure the next 6 months will fly by.

alrighty, I'm gonna go and spend time with the wife.

hope you're all doing well.

peace out, yoz"

You strive to maintain harmony in relationships, and usually succeed.
Articulate and enthusiastic, you are good at making personal connections.
Sometimes you idealize relationships too much - and end up being let down.
You find the most energy and comfort in social situations ... where you shine.

In love, you are very protective and supporting.
However, you do need to ""feel special"" - and it's quite easy for you to get jealous.

At work, you are a natural leader. You can help people discover their greatest potential.
You would make a good writer, human resources director, or psychologist.

is it seriously almost AUGUST?!?
a lot has happened in the past few weeks.
first and foremost, for those that don't know, Erin and I found out we're gonna parents! We found out on 7/7/07! Our lucky day. hehe
the baby will probably due on or around March 12, 2008...how crazy is that!!?? :-)

My playing has been getting better. Got a lot of good practice in last week.
Robert Spring from Arizona State came to town Wednesday to play with us on Thursday.
We of the clarinet section got to play for him in a masterclass on Wednesday.
I had to go first (lucky me!), so I played some Copland for him. Just the beginning and some of the cadenza.
He was VERY complimentary of my playing, telling me he enjoyed my playing every time I saw him until he left Thursday night. That felt good to hear :-)
He played the Rigoletto fantasy with us Thursday night, followed by his signature ""Flight of the Bumblebee."" I was very impressed with his  playing. He did some things that I probably wouldn't have done, but he's very knowlegable and VERY nice...very genuine.

Also on Thursday night, I got to conduct the TRADOC band playing ""Serenata"" by Leroy Anderson. It went really well. I felt good up there; wasn't nervous at all.
Everyone was very complimentary of my conducting, and that makes me feel good.
It also really gets my creative juices flowing and my hopes up for applying for OCS. I really think I have a good shot at it as long as I keep working hard and proving myself as a musician and a soldier. I'm very glad the Captain let me work with the band!

In other news, an opening in the Pershing's Own Ceremonial Band is ripe for the picking. I've been given permission to apply for it. I just have to call them up and make sure what they want on the tape and work up a technical piece to put on there. Everything from my recital last year was mostly lyrical and standard, so I needed something more contemporary with lots of finger waggling. I'll probably pull out the Martino that I played for my F2.

Also I need to get over to the school and get my instructor qualification done. I want to keep my options WIDE open so that I can have OPTIONS for my reenlistment, ya know?

Next week is our jazz concert for the Music Under the Stars concert series. And SFC Felkner has put quite a few clarinet solo pieces in there! It's gonna be an awesome opportunity for me to shine! (...or totally suck... lol)  There's one Benny Goodman tune on there that's SMOKIN, an Artie Shaw piece, and a Woody Herman chart.... Crazy times! Pray that I don't take a huge crap on these classic tunes!! lol
alright, that's it for now. It's gonna storm here in a bit and I need to get to the store.

I hope you're all doing well!

peace out, yallz"

Had some concerts lately...things are going fine with that
not exactly the most challenging music, but it's alright.

We had a concert last night. Everything went well
but after the concert, I was on the load crew to break everything down and put it back in the band hall.
while unloading a timpani, i ran the box into a brick column.
unfortunately, my HAND was between the box and the column.
smashed the ever-loving CRAP out of it.
so I had to go to the doctor this morning.
put me on profile for a week to let it heal...no playing for a week?! DAMN!
and I have a jazz band gig next week!
I've been working really hard on it and now I don't get to play it. :-(
I'm really cheesed about this.
hell, my hand is hurting just typing this message...WTF?!

in other news, the Captain has asked me conduct on a concert in July! 
When he told me, I was really surprised!
I know we had talked about the possibility, but I didn't think it would happen so soon!
this could be a great opportunity for me, especially if I do well, and especially if I want to do OCS.
and on top of that the possibility of playing the Artie Shaw Concerto with the band, and I could well be on my way to establishing myself as a good Army Musician here.
we'll just have to wait and see!

For all my Milwaukee minions (j.k!), I will be back in Milwaukee July 13-17! YAY!
not as long as I want to be home for, but I don't have a lot of leave saved up.
c'est la vie. *shrugs*
5 days is better than no days!

Erin is in Williamsburg for a few days, working the end of the festival, so I'm home alone.
I have tomorrow off as a ""breather"" day to catch my breath before the MUTS season starts.

but right now, I don't care about all that.
I was over at our neighbors' house until just now.
But I felt uncomfortable.
Chris's mom and two sisters were over there.
we had gone to the pool
and we were all messing around, doing stupid shit.
but apparently his mom thought that I was ""clinging"" to his sisters too much
they're 13 and 15
uh...dude...
wtf?!
yeah, I was playing with them. throwing the ball, trying to wrestle it away from them, yada yada yada.
and after we got back, me and Chris were outside and he told me this.
I got really pissed off.
not at him, of course. 
I just shut up and laid back
left everyone alone.
and then his mom tried to get friendly and ask me about my job
i dunno...

as i was telling Carolyn (Chris's wife), I have this...""complex""

when people aren't satisfied with the way I act or whatever, I don't just let their disappointment get to me... I get down on MYSELF, and make myself feel WORSE.
I don't care who it is.
My wife, my boss, whoever
I got better at it for a while
I just didn't care about what anybody said or did to me. I just let shit roll off my back.
i guess it's come back
I shouldn't let this bother me, I suppose
but I DO...
cuz I can't help who I am
I like to have fun
and have someone tell me I was being inappropriate or whatever?
yeah...pisses me off
but whatever

I don't even want to write about anything else that's happened, and a lot has happened.

I think Erin and I just need to get away from here for a while, by ourselves. she's stressed, I'm becoming complacent.

we'll see what happens in the coming months with this whole Army thing.
I've been contemplating going back to school to get my DMA. I really want it and then go teach somewhere. It's my passion. I love to teach people what I'm passionate about.
but I haven't been passionate about the clarinet lately.
I'm trying to get it back though
kinda like my passion for writing
i don't know where THAT went either
but if I find some new music to be inspired by, both to listen to and to play, I think I can get it back

the writing however, who knows

I don't even know if this shit makes sense...
or if anyone will even read it.
but whatever
it's written and I've spoken my mind.

i'm out




ps, the cubs still suck...

fuckers


pps, some cool stuff has happened lately...i should write about that tomorrow maybe..."

I've been at Ft. Monroe for a month now.
Everything is going really well.
People here are REALLY nice and I think I'll fit in well.
I've been put in the admin office, responsible for leaves/passes and in/out processing.
Everyone in this office is really cool, but I'm upset that my boss is going to be leaving soon :-(
she's really awesome, and I'll miss her when she leaves

haven't been playing much clarinet lately. I'm playing second alto in the jazz band. difficult to get back into the swing of things, since I haven't played in a jazz band since...1997! Great!
but it's going pretty well. A little more practice and I should be doing alright. As long as I don't have to solo, I'll be good!

The busy season is about to start. Gigs 2-3 times a week! NICE! I like to be busy, so this'll be a welcome change from the innui that surrounds me right now.

I need another car though. Erin uses the car to go to work and I have to fight for a ride home every day. Hopefully my bonus money'll come in soon and we can get another car cuz I need reliable transportation to accomplish what I want to get done every day.

We have some really nice neighbors. A young couple that's around our age. They have a 2 year old daughter who is adorable. She'll see me and just start yelling ""Matt! Matt!""
adorable. :-)

the neighborhood isn't GREAT, but it's not terrible. We'll probably end up moving on base eventually though, so that'll be good.

hrm...I guess that's about it for now.

I guess I should think about doing some practicing :-P

hope you're all doing well!

peace out, yoz"

This is a horrible article about a family that owns a dry cleaners that is being sued $65 million for a pair of PANTS...by a JUDGE!!

wtf, man?!

the US is going to hell in a hand basket with all of these over-priced suings of innocent people...

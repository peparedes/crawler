"event","I don't stop breathing every time the phone rings My heart don't race when someones at my door I've almost given up thinkin' your ever gonna call I don't believe in magic anymore.I just don't lie awake at night Asking God would get you off my mind It's getting better all the time It's getting better all the time. Yeah, I got to work on time again this morning This old job is all that I got to live And no one even noticed I'd been crying At least I don't have whisky on my breath. Yeah, I think I'm gonna make it
'Cause God won't make a mountain I can't climb It's getting better all the time It's getting better all the time. God, I hope your happy Girl, I wish you well I just might get over you You can never tell. I always thought that I'd do something crazy If ever saw you out with someone else But when the moment came last night I couldn't say a word, I stood there in the dark all by myself. Yeah, I could of said a million things All I did was keep it locked inside It's getting better all the time It's getting better all the time.It's getting better all the time...

Why do i still think about her? Why do i still talk about her?...nothing bad...but still...why wont these empty feelings go away?...she's taken all my ""friends"" with her too...i have no one now...im all alone...they dont even talk to me...THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MY FRIENDS!!! i know what i did to her to diserve this...but wut did i do to them? are they just following her? can they all just erase me from thier lives? did i really mean so little to them? Will i ever be able to find someone to replace them? they obviously can replace me...so im gonna have to...

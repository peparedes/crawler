"event","sooo basically it was POORING outside.


so we (me and Loren) were waiting for her dad to come get her.

and since i'm oh so fond of rain/puddles.
i ran outside barefoot and was running around in the rain.
it was crazy
i'm soaking wet, i can't feel my feet or my arms.
i think i might have pnemonia. but it was still fun

just thought i'd share that."

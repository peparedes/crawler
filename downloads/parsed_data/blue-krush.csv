The whole smoking, and partying, and sex stuff doesn't really help, but deep down you are great. I hope you and Jessica work everything out, because you guys were so close. I remember Jessica telling me how much her dad did for you. I hope you never took that for granted. Do good things and accomplish your goals. I had a crush on you for a reason. Stick to your morals and your friends. M.A.</EM></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc>Who ever wrote this I really appreciate it!! It was very sweet. Just to let you know I dont party anymore and even when I it wasnt like I was doing anything bad ya know? Yes I know I need to quit smokeing. And the whole sex thing its not like I go ariund having sex with everyone I am with one person and I have been with him for a year and a half!!! And we are safe about it !!! I dont know if you got the wrong idea when I said I have sex but i am with one person and I am 18 years old thats good there are girls that start having sex when they were 12 and 13 and sleep with like 30 guys!! So I think it is ver good that I was 17 and I am still with the same guy and I never did anything with anyone else besides kiss them!!! I hope me and Jess work everything out too!! I know her dad did everything for me I actually consider him more of a dad than my own!! I love him and miss him very much!!I never took anything he did for me for granted!!! I would really love to know who you are you shouldnt have not signed the message or put M.A because I have no clue who that is I dont know anyone with those initials well at least no one I could think of at this moment. Dont be afraid just because you told me you had a crush on me I wont think of you any differently!! Please sign your comment this time!! I woild really appreciate it!!</FONT></P>

Beauty,<br>laughter, life, magic...that's what you are all<br>about. You are refreshingly innocent and happy<br>with your life of purity and play. Life's a<br>game and it's a good one. In your eyes there's<br>no way to lose! You can be very mischeivous and<br>have been known to cause trouble, but it's all<br>in the name of fun and not meant to really harm<br>anyone. You like to play tricks on people who<br>aren't quite as bright or clever as you - which<br>is almost everyone. Nature is the setting you<br>prefer to be in - Always. Barefoot and wild you<br>can't be tamed. You're probably a restless<br>spirit who loves to travel, and quite a<br>dreamer. Your creativity is astounding and your<br>art (of whatever media - from writing to<br>painting to drama) is like something from<br>another world - ethereal and often very<br>fantasy-oriented. You can either be a social<br>butterfly or a loner with their head in the<br>clouds - but rarely inbetween. You stubbornly<br>refuse to accept responsibility or to give in<br>to the wishes of others - unless you feel like<br>it. You have a strong passion for music and<br>can't imagine life without it. You'll grow up<br>someday, but you'll always be a child at heart.<br>You are adventurous and love to take risks, and<br>feel a deep connection with the weather,<br>plants, and animals. You prefer sunshine to<br>thunder or snow, the warmth of summer to<br>autumn's chill, and quiet forests to suburban<br>backyards. Magic through and through, you are<br>far more powerful than you seem, and are<br>capable of being extremely passionate. Though<br>you can be childish, naive, stubborn, and self-<br>absorbed, one thing is certain - life with you<br>will never be boring!

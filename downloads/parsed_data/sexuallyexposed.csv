"event","Well I've been up all night either playing diablo 2 with bryan or listening to music in bed trying to sleep. yes sleep the very thing i crave most right now but my mind wanders and there is to few hours in the day to sleep as much we are &quot;supposed&quot; to.  I realize now that the world I thought of growing up does not exist and how I miss those days.  the world was at our fingertips and we could do anything we wanted with it. now those days are over and the harsh reality is we don't have all the opportunities we though we did.  Not all of us will meet the love of our lives or grow up to be successful.     
           I screw everything up and this is no different. I told myself I would never do anything to hurt her again, I swore on it.   I love her still.   I went to visit her.  Her room mates where drunk and as roudy as a bunch of whiskey drunk gutter punks could be. roommates got pissed. shit got destroyed and I stayed with her.  My failure was saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.  She is amazing and I would do anything for her even if it means not being with her.   
         The US is a complete disaster and Obama is going to have to pull some Houdini shit to get us out of this one.   Well at least I'll be around to watch it fall. from Canada while listening to goodbye america by the unseen.  media is everywhere, media destroys the minds of intelligent people and distracts from the real problems facing the world.  less people protesting means less chance of government being overthrown meaning the rich can keep getting richer without worry. war is the most evil of all evils.  War is where rich old  politicians send young ambition men to die.  it has happened as long as we have known.  why commit genocide against ones own race.  1. Religion to date this is has been the leading cause of war.  2. media and other campaigns convincing people to join the military by making it seem exciting and adventurous and not the sheer bloodshed that is actually war.   I hope someday we can all live as one.  No hippie bs either. World peace or bust."

"event","Ive noticed in the last few weeks there has been alot of peer pressure towards white drugs.  Until recently there existance was shrouded in secrecy from me I really dont like it because those things will ruin you.  For example a friend from whom I will not name has been having serious problems with cocaine lately.   Just in the last 30 days he has handed me over 1,000 for the drug an I would get it from a friend of a friend for him. although I know for myself Im not going to do it an peer pressure doesnt influence me much but I do feel sorry for the those suseptable to the drugs deadly cost and effect.  Ive seen some horrible things the drug does to you or those disgusting enough to make it into crack. well ive never seen anybody do this and honestly dont think I could sit there and watch it. But ive keep hearing about it and ive decided im going to stop getting it from people its really does bring out the worst in anyone.  Rather than just cut off my connection im going to try just telling everyone who asks me that I wont help them I am no longer contributing to the stupidity it causes people and hopefully someone will listen to what Ive told them and stop(its doubtful but im being hopeful.  I would like to write more since ive had alot on my mind lately but i really must go to work."

"event","Hey so theres been a bunch of drama in my life lately and its not cool.   About a week ago my girlfriend (at the time) broke up with me. It was kind of hard but after the second day she wrote me saying she was so sorry and she wanted me back and I forgave her.  For the next couple days after we got back together she was being more effectionate telling me she loved me and things like that. After that she went camping for a few days and when I finally saw her again she cut my hair and then I took a shower to get the hair off. when I got out she was gone and there was a note saying she didnt want to be with me.   She text messaged me and we talked to about it a little.  after that she I didnt hear anything till yesterday when out of no where she texts me saying that shes found a new boyfriend who is much better than I could ever be.  I was pretty confused about the whole thing I just dont get it, its like once she broke up with me she raced out and found someone else(2 days after we broke up) but why? to make me jealous maybe or else why would she rub it in my face.  Also one of my room mates moved out of my house a month ago because I caught one of his friends stealing from me so im having to pay twice as much per month in rent.  Ive decided that things just have a way of getting worse on there own before things start getting better. I cant think of much else that could go wrong so hopefully things will start looking up.  Well im not going to let anything get me down. you have to enjoy life while you can otherwise it just goes to waste. To anyone who is reading this remember that you are the only one who will always be there for you no matter what and if you dont like yourself thats gunna making things alot harder so always LOVE YOUR LIFE its all you have."

"event","hey the elections are coming up and im sure you hear it everytime you go downtown but i want to remind you theres not much time left so if you havnt registered to vote yet HURRY UP AND DO IT becuase theres some very important statewide measures on the ballot one of which i would like to bring to everyones attention is measure 33 

Measure 33 states that a vote for amends the medical marijuana act by requiring marijuana dispensary/caregiver sales to patients.
  now you might be wondering why they should open up dispensarys for marijuana and what the difference is between the old law and the new.  well to skip all the fancy legal bs it increases the amount of medicine a patient can have by growing there own.  Also for patients so ill the cant wait 3-5 months for there medicine or grow it under there condition there will be a source of medicine at there disposal (lets say this was antidepressants if you got a prescription saying you needed them but the pharmacy told you your going to have to make your own medicine wouldnt you find that a little rediculous). Also measure 33 allows not only doctors but nurses to issue standard medical marijuana applications. 
   Now you might be wondering why should I pay for all this they could use the money for something better well thats the great thing about it.  the program is completely state funded along with the existing Oregon medical marijuana act. What you may no know is that all of this cost have been offset by patient fees.  What you may not know is that the oregon medical marijuana program has a cash surplus of 986,356$ on top of the expenditures to run the program not included diverted funds taken from the surplus for the oregon house bill 2148. basicly what it all means is that if the measure passes not only will the program completely pay for itself but will also pay for many other important state programs.  
  Dont just take my word for it ask the people around you ask the people who have serious problems trying to get some meds. ask the many doctors, lawers and patients who are listed below and you will know we are the people this is our right and we need to fight for it.

    So whether your quadriplegic or you are a recreational user or just a Oregonian I encourage you to VOTE YES ON MEASURE 33

"event","ya so alot has happened in the last few days and being as such i havnt had time to update my journal.  To start on wensday the first day before my orientation i had gotten eriks cell phone the day before cuz he left it at putters and i called it and some girl picked up so i got the phone back from them.  so around 1 i went to north to give him back the phone i got yelled at by this teacher for sitting on a table but robby was to and they didnt bitch at him so when he came back around and asked me to get off again i made a big scene.  the teacher was like ohh well i will be sure to pay special attention to you now(good luck cuz I dont go to your fuckin school asshole).  after that went to the bank and got some cash got gas and went to my house.  erik was going to meet me ther but apperently i beat him so after a while i thought he wasnt coming so i left,  and went to putters to play some ddr.  after a while he called me up an him and preston came to putters and we fooled around for a while. after that i went and dropped preston off then went home.  at around 4 michelle(two ll's yay) called and i went to bj's to meet her and louise which was ok exept i didnt have any money to buy anything so i just sat there, when your almost broke only use money on important stuff(DDR).  after that we went to ALL THAT and more and played for a little while I had alot of fun to and thanks to michelle(thank michelle seriously) I got louise's phone number.  bummer im completely broke now and i have to work 5 days a week and i dont get paid till october 4th cuz im not going to have any money to call her and go play but hopefully i can get some bling bling before then cuz i want to see her sometime before october.   After that i got home and went to bed at like 9:30 since the next day i had to pick up wyle at the greyhound station at like  6am.  preston called me at about 5:30 to wake me and remind me to get him so i drove down there waited for about ten minites then he got there.  so we went back to my house and sat around there till he went with erik to north and i went to orientation. everybody there was really cool but the course of the day was just going over bullshit company policys pretty much. it wasnt that bad way better than tns so i cant complain. on my first ever break i listened to a CD well actually 3 CDs at cafe paradiso in the little fenced off area right on broadway. ya it was kinda scary but it i got over it once i realized she knew ever other person there.  the rest of the day was pretty boring just listening to someone rambling on about policys whatever.  After orientation is when the shit it the fan i get a txt from erik saying ""dude you need to come here right now"" so i txt him saying ""why whats up"" and he calls me back telling me wyle was going to leave and he opened the door and then just passed out on the floor. so i hurried and got back as fast as i could to find him next to passed out on the stairwell. to cut out the unimportant stuff we ended up taking him to whitebird and sat in ""the trip room"" for about 3 hours by that time preston was there so i had someone to talk to which was nice but seeing as i got up at 5:30 and didnt think to eat anything i hadnt eatin all day after the first hour and a half prestons moms showed up and brought wyle food he ate quite a bit and me and preston split a PB&J. after that went back to my house dropped wyle off then went back to my parents house and passed out almost immediately.  which brings me to yesterday got up and decided to take the bus to VD since i dont have much gas and have 2 dollars to my name.  so i went there listened to more bullshit for half the day then they finally put me on the phones. within the first ten minites of my phone training they wanted to put me on an actual job cuz they knew right off i knew my shit.  I got on Lowes which is a twenty minite home improvment survay for guess who... if you seriously have no idea u should be shot. i got 2 completes in about 2 and a half hours which is almost bid rate.  i want to be on politial polls though it seems alot easier.  after that i went to the bus station and headed home. on the way home i ran into candys little sister she needed a lighter but i didnt have any. so we went to my house got a lighter and went to the landing to listen to a CD after that i dropped them off and went home dustys back in town but ive been so busy lately i didnt call him back i needed some time to relax which was something i hadnt had in about 3 days so ya. then i went to sleep and i just woke up this mourning and started typing this.. and jezz this is going to be probobly my longest journal entry so if you read the whole thing congrats your done.

Me and Adam got in the car and went to the landing to listen to a cd.  Ive got to say though its a sweet car its got a pretty good sound system in it to i was really suprized when i saw it.  I had a interview at venture data at 2 so as soon as we where done at the landing we went downtown to vd. i got there like 20 minites early but it was ok cuz candy showed me around the place and introduced me to alot of really cool people who work there.  So ya i got the job pretty cool but i already knew i was going to so it didnt really bother me.  i really didnt even pay attention thru most of the interview (due to the cd we listened to earlier still playing in my head[if you dont know what i mean by this dont ask]).  after that i went to pizza pipeline to get some pizza waited like five minites and the line didnt move at all so i just left. after that erik picked me up at the bus station then we went to the seven eleven and got adam.  From there we made our way to putters to play this rpg style arcade game which we spent forever playing and then we had to go cuz erik had to be at work at 430 and it was like 405. so he went and dropped me adam and preston off at my house and i gave preston a ride home cuz it was like 420 and he had to drive all the way acrossed town in ten minites. so i took preston home and then went to get some gas. after that erik called me and said he was missing his phone.  i ended up  driving over to putters and getting the phone from this girl who found it. suprizingly the girl was either crystals girlfriend or someone who looked just like her i asked her but she didnt say anything.  ohhh also i saw this cool girl louise(super cute) while playing ddr at tilt on sunday who i met thru michele.   anyways after that i came back here.  the end

After that called up serina to see if she was ready to go since we where supposed to play dance dance revolution today. ya i made it almost all the way her house then erik called me up and wanted to see if i could give him a ride to the st vinnys car dealership since there having there big deal its 50 % off all cars under a thousand dollars and they got some boss rides for like 300 dollars. lucky for me st vinnys is right acrossed the street from putters so i picked him up and went back to serinas to get her. Serina finally let me inside her house after all this time it was quite a experence although very shortlived. so we squshed into my truck and went the car dealership we checked out this one car that was 200 but erik wanted to think about it before he spent his money. so we left there and went acrossed the street to putters once inside i was happy to find nobody was playing which has been a very rare sight lately. they where moving new video games in so they had this really huge dollys sitting around so me and serina decided we where gunna get kicked out so she jumped on the dolly and i started racing her around the arcade, nobody noticed for the longest time then finally someone did right as we where putting it back so they just told us to stay off of it, so we didnt exactly get kicked out but it was entertaining. then we played simpsons bowling and i got my ass kicked by serina, no joke. then me and erik played a game and we left went back to my house and dropped erik off stayed for a while not really because i wanted to be at my house but it gave me a good exuse to spend more time with serina as opposed to me dropping her off then being bored off my ass and going home. after about fourty five minites i got a call from adam wanting to go to the landing and listen to a cd so i dropped serina off at her house and went back to pats. then adam was all like we should go to the gas station and get gas apperently he thought he was the only one who was pitching in on it so he was like anybody else gunna throw down, i planned on and needed to get gas anyways so i was going to put ten bucks in it with my ten adam put in five and chris put in five. then we went to the landing and listened to a cd from there we went back to pats. at pats a scored a fairly nice sized track and smoked that shit. then chris offers to put another five bucks in my tank to take him over to seven eleven and the bank which took way longer than i had in mind but seeing as i got 25 dollars worth of gas in my tank and i paid 10 I was in no position to complain. once we dropped chris off at frag net gaming we went back to our parents house. sat around there for a while then i had to bring adams girlfriend home but she really didnt want to go home so we went to putters again and i played another round of ddr and then played a driving game. from there i made my way to her house checked out her room. stayed and talked for like a half hour then her parents started to come out so i left and came back here. so ya i guess i was pretty busy today but thats how i like it. anyways ive spent way to long typing so im gunna go

Once i got downtown and filled out the form i was told i need to take placement testing next so i decided what the hell dont have anything better to do until I can get my truck fixed so i went to pizza pipeline which by the way is jacked up the prices for pizza and it tasted like shit. I guess they broke a bunch of rules and the corperation started cracking down anyways Im officially changing my favorite pizza place to papa murphys at least for now. after that i caught a bus and headed over to lane. Once i got there i went to the testing center and waited in line for about 5 minites once they called me i was informed i would need to get in the students first line to pay for my placement tests. If you havnt been to lcc before the students first line is a joke. After waiting in line for about 45 more minites i pay my fee and was done within 20 seconds. seemed kinda a waste but it had to be done either way. After that got back in the testing line for about 2 minites and was helped. took bout an hour taking all the test and i did pretty good considering i havnt been to school in two years.  Then i set up my registration for tomorrow at 9 in the mourning. which could be a problem ill manage.  after that i went home left again and went to my parents house filled my taxed. Suprizingly im actually going to be getting like 250 dollars back i was expecting like 50 so thats good. That pretty much brings me to now with me sitting here typing about how special my day was. well im a little bored but other than that i would say things went really well today considering everything. 

... on an unrelated note I think im going to quit my job. 
    peace, Ash"

"event","ok well i havnt updated in over three months so im going to start doing it now basicly not alot has happened i dunno if i said it in my last updates but i moved into a new apartment and got my drivers licence. Ya also my parents gave me a truck to use so things havent been that bad.  i made out with two guys and a girl at a show last night.  anyways i made the mistake of falling for one of my best friends whos already with someone (wanna know who well thats to bad).  I want to at least still be friends with her but i cant every time i hear her talk about him i feel like part of me is dying.  so im stuck with only one possible solution which isnt going to be an easy one. im going to have to tell her exactly how i feel about her and then immediatly after tell becuase of this i can never see her again.  which is going to be even harder seeing how im the only friend she has.  Im she will make new friends but i know shes not going to take it well at all but thats my problem.  
    So for today i woke up at like eleven and went to my parents house. i met bryan there and then we helped my parents out with some yard work. after that we went to bryans and got arean and chumby and made chumby ride in the back with all the grass so he got pissed and jumped out so we left without him.  once at the fair we ran into kayla and her sister Kassi and like four or five other people i really didnt know. i ran into shorty in the petting zoo as well. lost my barbell for my eyebrow but luckily i was at the fair and there was a body jewelry booth on hand. after fooling around for a few hours we went to drakes lumber yard for kareoke night and attempted to buy a ""green day cd"" from bryans dad for ten dollars he said she was almost out so it that fell thru. i must say that it was the most pathetic kareoke night ive seen them have there was only 2 people there i didnt know and one by the time i left(about ten minites after i got there) ya decided to go get food at carls jr and never came back.  ok well my friend just here so i better get this over with. byes"

OK figures there would be this huge hip  hop show at the wow hall and scared all the hobos off.  basicly it was me erik and about 200 rappers.  Somehow we made it out without being fucked with, I got hit on by this preppy girl in a car at the show too she was cute but i didnt get a good look at her face. all in all i would say the day was a success, I managed to do everything I planned on doing today(except get drunk)"

"event","yesterday i finished watching the first season of clone high and i must say its quite interesting and made me really think about alot of things. one of the biggest concepts it brought to my attention was my lack in ability to date. whenever i go after someone i always end up with the wrong person by the end of the week.  im tired of all this i went after crystal and got completely fucked on that.  its like  someones just  trying to see how far they can push it until i snap.  i dont get it many people tell me im really hot, people tell me a have a great personality but somehow it seems to make no diffence. 
a few days ago i did something horrible and im sure the majority of people know exactly what that is because SOMEONES GOT A BIG FUCKIN MOUTH. If you dont know i really dont wanna say. anyways i feel so horrible i mean what was i thinking the entire experence made me question my sexual orientation. ive cried almost every night since it happened. all and all even that didnt bother me as much as the fact that i knew i betrayed a friend who did nothing to deserve that. im a horrible friend i dont think i deserve to be his friend anymore. god what was i thinking?

Amie chances are your not going to read this but if you do regardless of whether or not you hate me or what you feel i just want you to know there will always be a place in my heart for you. I miss the way things where when we would go out and get coffee or go to the mall and play ddr. i miss being able to tell you how i feel. you always knew how to make me feel better whether it be sympathy  or criticism. your the one i wanted.
well anyhow im afraid i must run for now. ill start updating more often soon...maybe"

then we went to josh and melissa's and met up with joe and joe.I hadnt seen joe haden in so long it was kinda cool. so we wnt over to joes parents for cd's;) i gotta really good deal on an 1/8 for 45 bucks and it was big.  lets see from there we went to eriks house sat around and then went skating and listened a song. then Me and joe haden left and went home. after that i really didnt do anything just sat around my house being lazy. so the next day at like 11:00 preston comes over and he goes and gets a new hard drive i got it working and then he left and i went to work. work same ol thing (except no amy) i was on freddy mak and i figured they would switch me at 6 to recruit but they didnt they sent me home 3 hours early it was so cool.  so from there i went to the bus station went home talked to people online. ok so far for today  im doin pretty good  amy went on a date last night im really happy for you amy. got up at about 11 with the sound of my phone ringing. after that i just got online and started writing this. ya i ran into adam the other day downtown. Zhens coming soon to visit me to I was wondering when she was gunna come down but shes bring a friend. which is proving to be a problem because i only asked my dad if zhen could stay here for a few weeks so i gotta figure something out im sure it will work out though. but i cant think of anything else to write about so until  next time later."

Ya its strange amys one of the only people i can hold on a conversation with for hours and not run out of things to talk about its really nice. also today during one of our discutions i offically decided im going to find a girlfriend and stop being such a pussy about committement. I also realized that im not the one to blame for the drama between me and hellen I was the guy who was just to nice and got used.  Its kinda funny though cuz i think the idea of it was supposed to hurt me. I honestly couldnt care less what happens to her at this point she let emotions get in the way of friendship and if im worth loosing for such a petty reason then shes not the kinda friend i would want if the first place.  So fuck it hellen your probobly gunna read this and i honestly dont give a fuck you can hate me all you want for writing this but at this point I couldnt give a fuck less what you think of me. at least i didnt just use you (ahh that felt good). anyways other than that nothin of interesting happened.

"event","Well today was an interesting experince i learned a can work and sleep at the same time and still kick everyone elses ass at work. Although I was thinking today and realized something ive been lieing to myself for along time I have pretended to play myself off as badass by always surrounding myself by buitiful girls because im always so scared of being left and having nobody who cares for me that i spent more of my time going after 3 or 4 girls at once instead of finding someone i really cared about and being satisfied with them and in the end i always seemed to end up loosing them all anyways.  Also i never dated people to avoid drama well thats a lie to its because i cant of the same factor. Im to scared to be with just one person so I cant date anyone. so from now on im gunna change all that. for the next few week im going to be doing no dating no sexual contact or anything of that sort. then find someone who i can really care about. OHH god i feel so emo saying that and im sure im gunna get mad comments about this one. In fact on the way home some girl was coming onto me and i made if very clear i wasnt interested.  other than that cant think of anything else to add ohh i beat a 8 foot song on ddr so im pretty proud of myself."

I made plans to meet cory at the mall and when i got there ran into James Odin playing ddr after about 10 mins of wandering around doing nothing at all i managed to find her and discovered she was one of the most attractive people way out of my leauge apperently she didnt think so. After that i was heading to work and ran into an old friend shane now part of the crew on caskadia live. It was the entire film crew talking about plans for the upcoming show after talking to them for a few mins they asked me to join them and help them out. I agreed. I have actually in the past talked to shane about the posiblity of me being on the show but never really thought about me being a perminite cast member. they all where really nice people and i feel liked me alot. after that i headed to pizza pipeline and got some food. same old think i do every day. From there i went to work fortunatly i found myself not working on recruit but working on freddy mac. I got off at 6 which was really good cuz i really didnt want to be there after that i called and talked to my dad for a few mins then called my mom. she came and picked me up and i got to drive her car which is really nice. I got to visit my grandpa and see him althought he doesnt remember who i am anymore or who he is for that matter. after that i went to g willikers and my parents bought me dinner.  from there i went to the mall and ran into rachel and michelle."

"event","today was pretty much the same as any other day went to the mall with friends played ddr. Saw a girl I hadnt seen in years and got her number. On the way home I gotta call from a girl I had never met and knew nothing about asking me if i would go on a date with her tomorrow. I  all the sudden felt really strange when i was younger I was constantly mad fun of and had little or no friends. Any girls i liked never liked me. Ive been thinking about it alot more lately and dont see how i have changed just aged. Also its probobly safe to say hellen doesnt want to have anything to do with me anymore. I find i really have no idea what i feel. Part of my brain keeps telling me that i should feel sad cuz I had a thing for her a while and I thought it could be something special. But when i think about it it really doesnt bother me much. ive decided im going to break my tradition of never dating people and go out on a limb. The whole experecence has opened my eyes about the idea. I really dont like the feeling that im a tool used for sex until someone better comes along but that controls gone now.  In the end i dont think i really regret it even though it went completely off because i learned alot of important things from Hellen.  I was hoping things wouldnt get wierd because i still think shes a really good friend.  The idea of use not being friends for such a inferior reason hurts me more than the fact that i was cast aside so easily.  
More and more lately ive been starting to think im bisexual ive been trying figure out if im just reading to much into it or not. I could never bring myself to have sex with a man though although thinking about it a none sexual relationship with a man doesnt really sound that bad at all. Anyways I have a date tomorrow so i better go to sleep otherwise i will just sleep in and miss it."

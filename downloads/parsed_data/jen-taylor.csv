However, it's being taught by a graduate student who appears to be about 12 years of age and, this is the best part of all, is a Southern Baptist who has lived in Texas.  Oh lordy, that's the stuff of which awesomely bad jokes are made.  I can't actually think of any right now, but they'll come to me soon enough, I am sure.  Really though, he seems like a pretty cool guy, and he goes with the if-I-don't-have-my-doctorate-then-just-call-me-by-my-first-name system as so many VCU instructors.  So hoorah for not having a pole up one's arse.  Yes, yes, good, good...time for lunch!"

We drank for a bit, I smoked like a freaking chimney (I know, shame on me), and then we played truth-or-dare.  Dear Lord, I haven't seen so much nudity in quite a while.  I mean a LOT of nudity, enough to go around and then some.  It was enough nudity to appease a 19-year-old boy wandering the streets of a European city, ala EuroTrip.  Well, needless to say, it was a lot of fun!  Over and out, I'm tired."

Ooooh, or when we had to do that assigment to create new words for English class last year... I have two that stick in my mind. One's better than the other, so I'll tell you the crappier one first.

Somnambulance- (n) Vehicle driven by the Sandman to resuscitate those who fail to wake up in time from ""falling"" dreams.

Chipocrite- (n) One who consumes chips until all that remains in the bag is three paltry chips and a handful of dust under the pretense of generously saving a snack for someone else in the future.

"event","Well, when posting an update I try to check my spelling for accuracy.  Ocassionally, I come across a REALLY awesome mistake.  Today was one of those days, and my brain was mushy.  So I looked at a comment I was about to post and rather than the word ""result,"" I found the word ""reslut.""  I'm not exactly sure what that would have meant, so I turned to Dictionary.com for answers.

re-
pref. 
Again; anew 
Backward; back 
Used as an intensive 


slut    
n. 
A woman considered sexually promiscuous. 
A woman prostitute. 
A slovenly woman; a slattern. 


So apparently a ""reslut"" is the following:

reslut
n.
A woman entered anew into prostitution and/or sexual promiscuity.

Stability results were moderately high which suggests you are relaxed, calm, secure, and optimistic. 

Orderliness results were moderately high which suggests you are, at times, overly organized, reliable, neat, and hard working at the expense of flexibility, efficiency, spontaneity, and fun. 

Extraversion results were high which suggests you are overly talkative, outgoing, sociable and interacting at the expense too often of developing your own individual interests and internally based identity. 
 

trait snapshot:

social, outgoing, worry free, optimistic, upbeat, tough, likes large parties, makes friends easily, rarely irritated, open, enjoys leadership, trusting, dominant, thrill seeker, strong, does not like to be alone, assertive, mind over heart, confident, controlling, feels desirable, likes the spotlight, loves food, social chameleon, hard working, concerned about others"

"event","The days are getting longer.  The weather's warming up.  Lunchtime is moving out-of-doors, and people are avoiding walking through buildings to get from point A to point B.

You've got to love this sudden burst of energy that is tangible on every corner of campus.  From Temple to Hibbs from the Cricket player in Monroe Park to the rastafari-esque vender on Main Street, everything and everone is perfectly attuned to the oncoming season of Spring.

This is what I call the semester slump.  We all know the feeling.  So close, yet so far away.  Feeling like slacking off but still having too much work to make that feasible.  This is the number one worst time in the college student's life.  

All I want to do is sit outside and do nothing (maybe take a walk at the most).  I don't want to fret about the things I have left until the semester is terminated.  I don't want to care about the two biology tests, the two child psychology tests, the two English tests and two English papers, the infinite busy work from MATH 131, or the remaining exams in my dreaded Death and Dying class.  I want to chill.  Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill . . . 

P.S. I'm drunk at 6:20 in the evening.  I'm not even going out.  Goodbye, semester, goodbye.

P.P.S.  I saw a license plate yesterday that read ""SNAZI.""  All I could see was the plural of ""Nazi"" if written by someone with a bizarre form of dyslexia."

Here are a few problems with David's Bridal:

A.  One must have an appointment to try on dresses.  However, the lady assisting you doesn't do ANYTHING!

B.  I despise being called pet names by people who DON'T KNOW ME!  (i.e. sweetie, honey, or even girlfriend)

C.  The women who work there display extreme emotion at all times.  When my mom tried on a mother-of-the-bride dress that was very flattering the response was ""OH!  It's just THE most beautiful dress!  You're the person that looks the best in it that I've seen!""  And when our assistant who doesn't do anything discovered we couldn't find the right top exactly (not a big deal, we order them anyway, we just try for sizes), she makes a sad puppy face and says, ""Oh no!  We don't have it?!  Oh no!""   I thought she might cry.

Stupid David's Bridal, I hate thee!"

Of course, my evenings will be Tracie-filled (because was anyone really expecting anything else?).  Also, I'm taking summer school this go around.  I'm excited about my first class, ARTE 301 - Art for the Elementary School Teacher, because my advisor told me it's lots of arts and crafts (and I think you are all well aware of how I feel about arts and crafts!).  Buuuuuuut, I'm also taking lots of biology crap.  I'm taking the 101 lab and Human Biology and the Human Bio lab.  It won't be too fun I'm sure, but the easiest teacher is teaching it for the summer session, so that's a plus.  Altogether I'll have 8 more credits out of the way of the core requirements.  The good news is that my 101 lab only meets for 3 weeks so it will be completely and utterly bearable.  Buuuuuuut, I'll have to abandon Pinchbeck for a bit while I'm doing that, but I'll be back for the last week of school.  Eh, they'll live without me.

"event","The weather is blah.  However, because it started snowing but didn't really stick, I got to wake up to snow falling in all its prettiness, without having to worry about wrecking my car within a half mile of my house.  BUT, I have my English test tomorrow.  I hate that class so unbelievably much, it's not even funny.  My professor has seen the Dead Poets' Society a few too many times.  All he does is show movie clips in class and tells us stories about his friend Cooper (Who, I venture to say, may be a fictional character Dr. Richardson's pulled out of his ass.).  I just feel like he's trying much too hard to impress a 200-level literature class full of 150 people and only 2 English majors.  That means that exactly 98.6(repeating)% of the class wants to write down the information needed on the tests, take the tests, pass the tests, and subsequently pass the course, thereby relinquishing him or herself from the Gen. Ed. of a 200-level English class.  But, given that he does not even lecture on American literature, I'm not sure how I am going to accomplish this.  So, wish me luck (or a meteorological catastrophe that would cause VCU to close on Friday)!"

"event","You know the breaking in period of a haircut?  Well, I've passed it.  I let my hair go curly and I'm definitely feeling it.

I had my first test in my death and dying class.  There are only three of them so the pressure was on.  I skipped all of my classes so I could study.

Watched ""Wit"" with Emma Thompson tonight for the class.  Great movie.  But I have a ""straight crush"" (as I say to describe a mild and non-sexual obsession with a member of your own sex) on Emma Thompson so I went into it slightly biased.

I had an up and down day.  But over really funny things.  Well, I wanted Moe's for dinner, but they closed at 9 and I wouldn't have enough time to go rent a video I needed for class and get over there.  So I accepted my fate of a Moe's-free evening.  Alas, I got to Blockbuster (one I usually don't rent from) and what did I behold, but a Moe's Southwestern Grill!  See down and then up!  Then, my mom told me I was going to Holland this summer and then said, ""Yeah, the tickets didn't work out.""  Up and then down.  
It was like VH1's Best Week Ever:
- No Moe's . . . downgrade.  Moe's next to Blockbuster . . . UPGRADE!
- Holland for two weeks . . . UPGRADE!  Tickets not working out . . . downgrade.

Oh, well.  Tomorrow I have to be at Pinchbeck in the morning.  Love the kids, hate waking up!

I'm off to bed!  I'm ready for sleep . . . 

What a wonderful day today was.  I'm happy.

Gabeish boy (i.e. Billy . . . Tracie, you know about the nickname) says I didn't show up for the movie.  Truth be told, I did show up.  I told him to be there a 9:30 and I left at 9:45 when he wasn't there.  Regardless, the movie began at 9:55 so he still had 10 minutes for the movie to start, but was still 15 minutes late for me.  Well, I deemed that at least midly rude.  So I told him so, to which he replies that it is rude not to have a device by which someone may reach you (i.e. a cell phone).  Well, that just about did it.  Whether he felt he was justified or not, an apology STILL would have been in order for being late for our meeting time.  Did I recieve that?  I'll give you two guesses, and the correct answer begins with an ""N"" and ends with an ""O.""

Well, I shouldn't leave out that I had Utah with me, so that was cool.  We just blew that popsicle stand because we weren't 100% into seeing a movie about a child molester starring Kevin Bacon (The Woodsman, if anyone is interested in it ;)).  It all worked out, so I'm not pissed about that, but I am pissed about Billy's commentary on the situation.

EL FIN!"

"event","Tonight was surprising:

1.  I had a really good hair day when I really wanted one.
2.  The trip to the Forneris' house was painless.
3.  The trip to the Forneris' house was enjoyable.
4.  John the redhead showed up.
5.  I watched Brother Bear with Christine and LOVED it.


Tonight was not surprising:
1.  I didn't talk to John the redhead, because did anyone really expect anything
    else?


Oh well, tonight was successful.  We discussed wedding shower plans with Mrs. F.  I quasi-bonded with the Forneris boys.

Tonight was really chill because I didn't feel uncomfortable like I usually do in homes of strangers.

Tracie, I think you're the only person who reads this and who ever will.  I mean, I know I'm incredibly interesting, so not everyone can handle the Jen Taylor LJ's coolness.  Yeah."

"event","I am a happy soul...I passed on an evening of creepiness and got something so much better.  Denny's breakfast for a late-night dinner with Utah.  No, not the state, the Indian.  I may not be Mormon, but I love Utah.  (Sorry, that was a direct quote from the kid.)

I also looooooove Tracie, my best friend in the whole world!  We were discussing the beginning of our friendship.  Too funny!  Such a great story of shared irks and quirks.

I talked to my cousin tonight.  Long time no talk.  Five days apart are we; though I'm the older of the two!  I'll see him in October for Julia's wedding.

The kiddies said they loved my hair.  Love them too.

These are good days I'm in; they let me note the good things."

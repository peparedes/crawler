"event","It has been quite a while since either of us have written in this so I decided tonight was a good night to do such a thing. Well honey I like you very much and I like how you like me too. I'm trying not to be too cute-sey with you because I suppose thats what you want, you know. But I really cant help but plan out MY life and by default you are added to it because I want to be with you, just remember when I talk about kids or a house I mean my life, my family, and I only hope that you will be there with me to see all these things and take part with me, so please dont get freaked out. My emotions get carried away but you must realize that I need stability and I need reassurance and I suppose that makes me a needy person but I cant help it. I just hope that you feel the same way, if not now atleast someday. I appreciate you. I am so glad that I have spent all this time with you because I really dont know what I would do without you. You are my rock and when I leave, I dont know what Im going to do without your words of kindness and love. You are the only family that I want and need. I am scared babe, I dont know how Im going to deal. I do the things I do because I know that I can see you or talk to you after it, I dont want to have to wait four years to see the progress I've made for us,its just such a long time to wait. Well I dont know bebe. I love you. And I am glad to have made the memories I have made with you."

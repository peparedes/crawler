I miss you all the time,
And I love you with all my heart,
That's why I hate when we're apart.
I never meant to keep the secret,
I didn't mean to hurt make you mad,
I truly feel awful and sad.
I just want you to know,
I really, really love you,
And other people may say it to,
But Katie,
Nobody will love you the way I do.

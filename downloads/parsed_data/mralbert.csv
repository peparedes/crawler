Sammie and I had our one year anniversary on the 22nd of April. We went to Quebec city to celebrate in the European-like town. We stayed at the Chateau Frontenac which was so beautiful! There was a kick-ass pool with a fucking amazing view so once Sam pinned my ripped swim shorts back together, we went swimming and hot-tubbing. We sat outside for a while because it was lit up with white lights and we could see all of Old Quebec. All of our meals were at the little cafes and really cute restaurants. The waiter of one place had a weird accent and we had no idea what I asked him for when I told him ""seulement un"" in response to his question. Whatever it was, we never got it. It was an awsome weekend and an even better year!"

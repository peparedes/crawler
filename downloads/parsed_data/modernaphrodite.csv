We came home to two baby foxes playing in our yard.   They were so little and the cutest things I have ever seen.   One came right up towards the car, very curious about the bright lights.   We went inside soon after so we wouldn't worry the momma.   

I hope we see them again.  :)"

It was weird seeing it in a theater not surrounded by fellow geeks.   Just Erik and I seemed to notice certain cameos and things like that.

"event","I never post anymore.   I'm too tired and my days are fun, though mainly the same and uninteresting to anyone but myself, so I don't bother posting them.  Even though LJ is the land where everyone needs to know what shampoo you used.  I did have an interesting weekend so I guess I will post about it.  Plus some people added me at some point so I feel vaguely obligated.  (I have no idea why, as far as I know, I have one of the more boring LJ's I've seen)

Alluvial came to visit and we attempted to go to the fetish flea.   We all had fabulous costumes planned for the masquerade ball later that evening, myself a geisha kitsune, her a naughty bakeneko, and Erik as the lucky Tengu.  Unfortunately, Alluvial and I were sick all week and slackers about our costume ( I was of course, the laziest about it.)  So we stayed home to try and finish them.   The sewing machine wouldn't cooperate so we just did what we could and went to the ball.  I had no idea how complicated and constricting obi were, and that they do not hold up well as well to slutty dancing as they do to a more precise Noh style, and I almost found myself being far more revealing than I planned.   Alluvial and I are fabulous and creative and made me a sexy top out of silk scraps.   Alluvial and I had fun dancing in next to nothing, Erik had fun watching (as did everyone else, judging by the loads of compliments).  There was lots of latex but not nearly enough masks, but I did not need to bleach my eyes the way I was afraid I would.   Except when studded thong man lost both his thong and his cape on the dance floor.  Alluvial and I retreated from the dance floor at that point.   We stayed out super late, and were way too tired to go to the flea the next day either.   I guess I will wait till the summer to learn how to use my bullwhip better.

Job is going well, there is an even better potential promotion coming up and I am excited.  It would mean less hours, but hopefully more pay, and it would be easier to take classes so I can finally graduate. 

The apartment is coming along very very slowly.  I have to learn that the floor is not my closet and find homes for my numerous shoes and bags.  I have goldfishies though and they have a pagoda .   They are very cute and give little goldfish kisses.   Lola is still pretty and bitchy and Simon is getting more dragon-y every day.

Erik and are doing really well.   I won't bore my one or two readers with the mushy details except to say that Ty was right, sometimes that happy giddy head over heels feeling doesn't fade  away.

I'll finish with that I'm sorry I'm so terrible with the keeping in touch, I just retreat this time of year and assume no one wants to hear from me.  Silly and I'll try and stop.

The people I work with are fun, but I'm bored not doing anything other than transactions.   I miss the coin machine.    I will start training for my mini-promotion when I get back though, and I get to read when the branch is empty so that's a plus.

Erik and I are watching the first season of Beauty and the Geek.   I don't like these geeks as much.   They're much more bland than geeky.   I miss the Dungeon Master of the second season (He and the Woody Allen look-alike who won were super cute.)   There is nothing I love more than a hot DM.  (wink wink)  Erik and I discussed how if he pretended to be socially awkward and I pretended to be dumb, we could totally win, though I realize that we kind of would defeat the growth purpose of the show.   

Thanksgiving was good.  Spending time with his little cousins reaffirmed for me that I really want to teach, or perhaps go for my masters in art therapy.   I feel that it is a job that I would be good at and would make me happy.  Erik made absolutely delicious apple pies.

I guess everything's going well.  I miss people, and I have to stop being convinced that no one wants to hear about my boring (though very happy) life and actually contact people.   

I'm really content now though, and that is good."

The only thing that would have been better would be a Voodoo Hamlet, where Ophelia turns Hamlet's whiny ass into a Zombie and he works in the fields, or him being a zombie is used as an excuse for his lack of ability to make decisions.

"event","So we have internet and cable, which is exciting.  The new place is amazing.  My only complaints are minor (there is no tub and someone with very different taste picked the wallpaper and boders in the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.  At least most of that is fixable)and the general fantasticness of the place more than makes up for it.   

The kitchen is huge and really well designed.  I was able to find convienent homes for everything.  And it has a dishwasher.  That alone made the place worth it as I cannot stand doing the dishes.

We have a study, a sunroom, and a basement, besides the kitchen, bedroom, living room, and bathroom.  The place is the size of a small house.  Which is good because Erik and I have enough stuff to fill it up (With shoes, minis, and books).  

There is also a laundry room and we are the proud owners of a washer/dryer set.  They are my(our) first owned appliances and therefore make me exceedingly happy, in a way I thought only new shoes could make me.

There is a deck and a yard.  We're right in between a nursery and a park so I look outside and see beautiful trees and flowers and no other people.  Heaven.

Our upstairs neighbor is polite but keeps to himself, and is relatively quiet.  He is my definition of the perfect neighbor.

I will post pics of it soon.  

Other things good and bad.   I like my job and have become a favorite of the old ladies.  A particularly lovely lady brought me peppermints because I was so sweet when I waited on her.  Another woman told me I was gracious which I thought was a wonderful compliment.  I do find it ironic that I hate people, but continue to excell in jobs working with the public.  I have been sick at work and the past week was rather awful for that.  There were a couple of points on friday when the pain was so excruciating I almost couldn't stand.  But I have no choice but to work, and I'm used to it, though maybe resigned is a better term.  Soon I will have health insurance and I like to fantasize about how easy it will be when I don't have to deal with it quite as much, especially since fall and winter are my worst times. 

Erik and I are, well great, though as usual I don't have the words to say how giddy he makes me.  

And while there are the hints of beginings of new friendships here, I miss people I care about very very much.

I think I've put off sleep long enough.  I put off going to bed because of nightmares from reading The Kite Runner and a vicious ex(I fortuneately don't remember much of those other than waking up terrified), but I think I'll be ok now.

Erik and I are looking at apartments.  There is one I really want that has a sunroom and a deck.  I'm so excited.  We need our own space.

I'e had very bizarre dreams lately.  The latest involved me fighting zombies in an apocalyptic Tokyo using an ice cream truck and everybody lived in the penthouse apartments or in the neighborhoods built away from the zombies on top of the buildings.  My subconcious thinks like anime, exept for the lack of robots, aliens, or school girls.  I guess they would have showed up had I not woken up sick.

I'm drawing again, I'll post those later and bemoan about how much I suck. At drawing, just to clarify for those with dirty minds like myself.

Things are good.  Work is going well.  The people at work are nice and seem to like me.  I haven't (knock on wood)made any major mistakes yet.  I have gotten rather adept at talking about the weather and having the same conversations about my name or being a new teller over and over again.  But it's a good job all in all, and I'm happy with it.

Living with Erik's parent's is slightly stressful on both sides.  They're very sweet though so it is going well.  They reacted well to me never having cooked on a cast iron pan and setting off the smoke alarm.  Apparently the pans hold heat well and get hotter and hotter.  Good to know.  :)

Erik and I are great, which goes almost without saying, except that I like to say it. I can't wait till he's no longer commuting and won't be as tired.

I also reconnected with my best friend from high school.  It was really nice to see her and hopefully we'll be able to hang out more, especially now that we're in the same area.

I feel overwhelmed and while I'm happy to be moving on, and very excited to be doing so with Erik in about two weeks, I'm sad as well.  This area was my home for so long, and I will miss it, though I know that what I actually miss is more of the idea of the place and the people that were here than how it is presently.  Though there are still people here I will miss.  I'm rambling, but my point is, I'm all freaked out.

Erik and I are having a big party next weekend, with the guys upstairs, to try and revive the Hick Games and as a goodbye for us.   So if read this and are in the area, come say goodbye to him or me, or the cave, or just to have a good time.  IM or e-mail me if you need directions.

I want to be waited on and I complain and whine like no one has ever had a cold (even though I caught it from Erik) and can't sleep, I'm cranky, etc.  I normally deal with my whole kidney-related problems and migraines pretty well, but to not be able to breathe and have a sore throat on top of that seems like too much.  I think it's kind of the straw that breaks the camel's back.  I have to be sick all the time with something painful and chronic, I should have a ""get out of regular sick"" card or something.  At least that's how I feel when it hurts to talk and I'm whining like I'm five.  I feel bad for Erik since he has to deal with me.  I'm just lucky he's really patient, and that I'm apparently nowhere near as bad as his ex's.

It's been an interesting week.  Cinco de Mayo party was fun until a point, but I kind of expect them to have drama or slightly awkward things happen if last year's was any indication.  I saw Stick It last night with Liz, Allison, Erik, and a friend of Allison's, Ken.  Oh and a boy Liz wrangled into seeing the movie instead of RV.  Amusing, in that way silly teen movies are.  Not as good as Bring it On (missing the cute punkish romantic lead I wish had gone to my high school), but enjoyable none the less.

I've been packing, probably much more slowly that I should, but packing to leave this weekend.  My new job starts on Monday, so I'm moving in with Erik's parents this weekend.  Erik isn't leaving until the end of the month, so I'll be back to visit during the week and on weekends, but I will have officially moved out of the valley.  Yay me.  

Anyway I have to go shower and join Erik at his job to be a huge dork.

There is this weird backlash I get for not being traditionally dorky girl enough.  People who don't know me seem to think I was the mean girl in high school.  I wasn't.  My blunt honesty isn't always nice and I am guilty of the occasional catty comment (who isn't?) but I certainly wasn't the bitchy head cheerleader.  I was tortured in my middle school in Brooklyn (once literally), and when I got to high school in Mass, I never cared about being popular.  When you move to a small town and are from NYC, everyone will know who you are, but that I couldn't help.  In high school I was known, friends with people from all different groups, dated band geeks, went to punk shows, was involved in drama and the newspaper and yearbook, and had a (undeserved, much as that may surprise people) kind of slutty, bad girl reputation.  My friend Danielle and I were really weird, but no one seemed to notice or care.  My point is, I had fun in high school, but it wasn't my raison d'etre, and I didn't spend my time picking on anyone.

I don't see why being into fashion and enjoying things like dancing sexy with my friends makes the dorky things I do less valid.  Or that I like these things for the same reasons everyone else who likes them does.   I like fashion because my mom is a designer and I grew up with it.  Playing with clothes is like playing with paint.  I like dancing and while it amuses me when people are watching, I will dance that way by myself or with a friend regardless of anyone watching.  It's just how I dance.  

I complain about it to Erik sometimes, but it really just makes me cranky in that way that any kind of stereotyping does, and that is just seems to be so rampant in the ""alt""  communities.  I know that I can like Miu Miu and minis, diablo 2 and sexy dancing.  Since I don't feel a need to belong, my interests are just that, my interests, rather than completely defining my personality.  I'm just lucky that I found people to be friends with that are the same way."

"event","Things have been good. Great even, and more than just the Erik aspect of things.

Most importantly, I now have a job for the summer.  I will be a bank teller in Milbury.  The training starts May 15th.   This is a huge relief as I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find a job and not having a job has made me quite crazy.  Except I feel like I don't have any bank appropriate clothes.  Oh no, I have to shop for more clothes and shoes.  Very much a tragedy.  (I'm sure Jay will comment on the ridiculousness of me needing more shoes.  My numerous (and often bloodthirsty) shoes are an ongoing apartment joke.)

I've realized that I have to put more effort into talking to my close friends.  Now that I feel like we've mainly worked out what happened on both ends, I need to make sure that we stay close.  Especially because I miss them when I don't talk to them.  And when I can call them and talk to them when things are bad, not just when they're good, something I felt like I couldn't before.  But I'm trying and it's working out, which is making me feel more loved and happy.

I finally met the lovely Aubrey, and she is adorable and delightful, just like I thought she'd be.  I'm hoping that she will be a frequent guest in the fall or even in the summer after she graduates.

Erik is of course still wonderful, even when one or both of us gets slightly cranky (well I get cranky and he gets meloncholy).   I am terribly, fantastically spoiled.  I have a boyfriend who will give foot and back rubs with no prompting on my part, and takes my concerns about zombie attacks with a grain of gravity, and matches my mind's wandering path that will expand on anything and everything.  He thinks I'm always beautiful, but more importantly he loves that I'm jack of all trades smart.  I never feel like he's dating me to prove something.  There's so much more I could talk about, but I won't bore the 5 people who read this with the gushing details.

I've been wanting to play D&D again.  But I sadly have no one to play with, which makes me feel like even more of a loser than missing playing D&D does.  

I'm happy and finding new music through Pandora (which connected Tom Waits and King Missile.  Totally sold on the site after that) while I organize Erik's closet.  Though I might have to stop soon and watch Dead Like Me with him instead."

"event","Three Halloweens ago, my friends Liz, Steph, and I decided we would go as Charlie's Angels from the second movie, specifically the scene where they dance in sexy military uniforms (<a href=""http://www.ba.no/multimedia/archive/00339/charlies-angels-ver_339742h.jpg"">This scene actually</a>).  We already had the right hair colors and we spent weeks on the costumes as there were none to be found.   I(Drew Barrymore) found a jacket on e-bay, Liz(Lucy Liu) converted a silky bathrobe, and we scoured the mall in search of lace gloves for Steph(Cameron Diaz).  Not to mention all the ribbon adding and sewing.  We looked sexy as hell, unfortunately I don't have the pics up on my computer.

I just found a website with at least two of the costumes.  They are of course way too expensive so we likely would've made our own anyway, but the option of not having to do that work would hae been nice.  Oh well.

I wish I had an excuse to wear that costume again.  It was very fun."

"event","I had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.

It included hives if that's any indication.

Erik was amazing, even when I was rather snappy at him(and I can be quite snappy and mean), and Jay was also quite considerate when I was going through hysterical girl mode earlier this morning.

Some entity is conspiring to make me crazy, but I refuse to give.   All this introspection and mild hysteria has just led to the conclusion that I both need to get out of the house and perhaps find some friends that don't make me feel like I'm forever banned to be on the outside looking in.

Or maybe it's just PMS and my wandering uterus.  Let's hope it's PMS and not so much the wandering uterus as they are all wily and a pain to locate.  Also I'd rather it wasn't the entity thing.  I'd hate to have to try and make amends with some minor deity of bagels or something."

"event","My birthday weekend was a mix of good and stressful.   Stressful would be dealing with my mom on Saturday and today and none of my friends seeming to remember my birthday.  Good would be excellent presents and dinner with my family and Erik, well wishes from Jay, Aubrey, and other family, and just Erik generally being the best boyfriend in the world.   

I have lots of books and crafty things, as well as a fabulous kate spade purse and a date with my sister for shopping and Fire and Ice.  I have Erik's heart in delicious gummi form and both seasons of Dead Like Me.  

I am a (mostly) happy kitsune."

"event","Tonight I made stuffed peppers.  They were fantastic.   I would be such a fabulous fifties wife, except for the whole twin beds thing.    

Erik and I had dinner with his parents on Sunday.   They're so great.   They're more conservative than my parents, but Erik has a similar realtionship with them, so it's fun to watch from an outside perspective.  His dad flat out asked when we're getting married.  Not yet, is the most accurate answer I can think to give.   I think living at his parents house this summer will be fun, especially since we will have the house mainly to ourselves.  I'm mostly just looking foward to getting out of The Cave.   

I like all my roommates but I'm getting more and more excited about Erik and I having a place that is ours.  I have way too many decorating ideas and potentially having a dishwasher and kitchen that stays clean is thrilling.  And doesn't kill my plants would also be good.  We already live together so well that I don't even have the worry of that.

I'm sick and have retreated somewhat since it got cold again.  I'm trying to reconnect with people and some of it's working, some of it's not.  Such is life, and I'm trying not to take it all too personally and the friendships that have been refound more than makes up for the lack of response in others.

I guess basically my life is more of the same, ordinary, quiet, and mostly very happy."

"event","So I had what started out as an amazing dream of an epic battle between good and evil that dignerated into a mild spat between good and evil when the dream somehow against my will turned into a larp.   First I was a specially trained assasin/torturer used by good to keep the balance between the two and find out what evil was up to.  I wore a red leather catsuit so it was quite obvious I was bad-ass.   The next guy I was assigned to was in fact the ex love of my life who had disappeared, played by the rather sexy Hugh Jackman.  After a tearful reunion I of course realized that I couldn't be working for good, but was instead working for a corrupted good.  This led to a scene of me freeing a line of prisoners ""good"" had taken in an alley, that at some point after freeing the third or so prisoner that the alley turned into shop and stop.  I continued freeing the prisoners and then had a dramatic confrontation with the head of the ""good"" organization, something about how I could see the good in the eyes of every man when I finally killed them, no matter how evil they were.   I walked away to wait on line with Erik and tried hard not to giggle at the silly clichedness of the whole thing.  Dream and real me realized at the same time that we somehow embroiled in a dreaded larp and promptly woke up.  I now refuse to go back to sleep if this is what my subconcious comes up with.

I went to both 80's night and a party at Sam's, as well as having dinner with Liz earlier in the week.  I feel more social than I have in quite some time.  The party at Sam's was fun, though I felt much older than everyone there, except Pat (and Erik obviously).  Probablly didn't help that I just chaperoned a party with people the age most of the guests looked like.  I can't wait to get out of the valley.

Other than that things are both great and crappy.  I am sick all the time and the job situation is going so badly that I've given myself two weeks to find something or I go back to CR, which made me miserable.  Erik and I are fantastic, so much so that as usual I don't really have words for it, and I'm excited about our future.  Hopefully I'll find a job soon and stop going stir crazy."

Geisha charm
<img src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f386/Kuzunoha357/kitsunedoll022.jpg"" alt=""Geisha charm"" /> </lj-cut>

I will be using the white fur for the tip of the tale and as a kind of ruff around the mask.   The geisha charm is kind of an indicator of what the kitsune's other form is, and the photo here is unfortunately kind of blurry.   I'm really happy with it so far, and all I need is wire so I can pose the arms and tail, and something for claws.  And I will have leftover fur I think.   The next one will be spring themed and there is pink fur I want as soon as I have money again.

Things other than that are also good.  Erik and I were out shopping for stuff before the ""blizzard"" and I got a migraine.  Not only did he run and get me jasmine green tea (my favorite) so I could take my pills, but when we got back to the car there was a small vase of tulips and tea roses on the dashboard(my favorite flowers for bouquets).  It was so sweet and unexpected.  We agreed not to do anything for Valentine's Day other than eat steak and lindt truffles and watch scary movies (so pretty much a normal night for us) as both of us think expected romance is pretty close the opposite of romantic. So it was extra great to get flowers in way that I think is actually romantic.   And I have the best boyfriend ever.  Which is basically all that I have that is exciting to write about."

"event","I wanted to post these really cute avatars which were two versions of me as a comic book heroines, but livejournal is dumb and I have no website with remote loading.  I might try and use them as my LJ icons instead.
Nothing terribly exciting is going on, hence the lack of posting.   Erik and I went to Haven this past week.  It was the suck as only Haven can be.  Jeremy has been over with a creepy Steven King series that was fun to watch.  I'e been obsessed with scary movies as of late, though I have no idea why.  Though not a lot of the ""scary"" things I've been watching have actually had the effect of causing fear.  Though the Masters of Horror involving a necrophiliac polyamorous woman and her zombie partners was pretty disturbing, but more in a ""Ewwww!"" kind of way.
My car won't start so my parents came up here to visit me.  Ena took me shopping, my dad came up with a ridiculous amount of senerios/things I should do, so it was pretty much typical time with them (but still fun).   I will be doing a project for my dad's company which I'm excited about and he offered to pay for any classes I want to take, which was also great.  I also have decided to continue my obsession with kitsune and make kitsune dolls.   I found perfect fur and I love doing crafty things.  I'm going to make a tanuki one as well.   I wish I knew other people that were into stuff like that because I would love to make one for someone who would appreciate it, as I can only make so many for myself (I've limited it to two).
Erik and I are great still, though that feels like an inadequate way of describing how giddy the relationship still makes me.
So, I am happy and alive (though still really sick) at least, even if I don't have a lot to write about."

You are the Kitsune, or ""Fox demon,"" the ultimate doer of mischief.
Kitsune belong to a class of demons known as ""Henge,"" or animal
shape-shifters, along with the Tanuki, or badger-demon. They are
uncanny creatures who are notorious as much for their malevolence as
for their wild and unpredictable behavior; a fox demon may help a
human, only to betray him in deepest consequence at a later date.
Kitsune are known to frequently possess women or pose as humans,
causing chaos and catastrophe where ever they go. They are mischievous
creatures who take great pleasure in playing terrible tricks on
unsuspecting mortals; however, this behavior indicates that they are
more perversely playful and apathetic to human suffering than genuinely
evil and desirous of harm. </td>

"event","I've been watching a lot of Buffy lately, Season 5.   I've always liked Spike as a character far more than Angel.   He's bad-ass, but has this inner dork, and is passionate, clever, and grounded.   The relationship he has with Buffy always stuck with me, and I could never really put my finger on why.   Then it came to me while I was watching Crush.  Their weird, s&m , I love/hate you dynamic is disturbingly similar to one I had with one of my first boyfriends.   I don't ever really talk about him excepet in a joking way, because a lot of the relationship was painful, but that episode hit home.   The situation wasn't eaxctly the same, obviously, but I do have scars from one of the last times he tried to prove how much he loved me (scars I almost invariably forget to count when talking about how I have a inordinate amount of scars.  I really don't like to think about that segment of my life too much).  Particularly facial expressions Spike made and they way he just didn't get that what he'd done was disturbing were a little to familiar.   Part of why I like the series so much is how I can connect to it.   I wish I'd actually watched it more when it was on TV, but I'm still glad that Steph got me watching it, so now I can borrow Andy's dvds and contemplate it at my own leisure.
In other news, I've been sick and bored and freaked out about both finding a job and switching schools.  I have not been fun.   I finally slept at night, rather than the day, and feel much better about everything.   Erik being amazing about being here for me when I need him definately made things easier.  I am so lucky in having won the boyfriend lottery.   Erik will help me job search and cover letter write when he gets home, and we will likely go to 80's night tonight, so if you have nothing to do, you should come out.  No cover charge and I have way more fun there than I do at Haven.  Ok, I'm going to go shower and then actually do things with my day."

...... All You Care Is About Yourself
And Im Pretty Much Sick Of It~....



I have been there for you
Every step of the way
I've picked you up on rocky paths
And have supported you each and every day

I have listened for hours on end
When you were crying on the other line
I've dropped everything I was doing
Just to be by your side 

I have stood up for you, no matter what people said
And been there for you 
When things weren't going right
And you didn't know what else to do

I have put all my energy into helping you
Because that is the kind of friend I wanted to be
But can you say the same 
Have you always been there for me?

I have had days, when I just needed someone
And yet you found just one more excuse

I spend my life trying to be a real friend
Because friends mean the most to me
And yet it always comes out the same
Your never who you want to be"

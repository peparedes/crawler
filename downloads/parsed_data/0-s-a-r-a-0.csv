"event","im sooo flippin bored. although i did go to a party last night. it waz kool, but my big bag of sexxxi waznt therr, and that really suked. but i brought my friend gabii, so yah it waz kool. i went swimming in my cloths. my second time swimming this week might i add. and yes i am proud sayin that beecuz the last time i went swimming waz last summer. soo yah. i went to the pool earlier this week wit my skool. it waz gay but better than i would have hoped for. but having 3 ppl humping ur and one of those ppl then l8r tryin 2 get u up ur ass, now thats what i call a good time. i waz also used as a decoy this week cuz my dumbass friend devon didnt wanna go out wit her even tho he told her he would so gabii took the prid 2 tell her i was goin out wit him and he said to go along wit it and we'll ""break up"" the next day.....well he didnt stick wit the plan and blew me off in 4th period. so when eva one of amanda's friends came up abnd asked me if i waz goin out wit him i said yes, so they wouldnt tell the skanky ass poseur bitch i waz lyin, so NE that waz great. and earlier this month i got in a fight wit dev beecuz he's changed and he didnt believe me so i got pissed and didnt talk 2 him 4 eva and  i guess we still tight but i digress. i wont get into detail bout that and y exactly i got mad, its very long and deatiled. NE ways g2g.

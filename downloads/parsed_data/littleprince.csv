"event","The ideas in the reading can be slightly abstract or convoluted, but I'll try to share what I know is clear:<br /><br />...<br /><br />An earlier excerpt discussing the falling in love and it being beyond our control:<br /><br /><br />Falling in love, then, is a result of two things coming together: The longings which we have and the workings of our imagination. <br />The first draws us out of ourselves in search of another personl the latter intimates that a particular other person may be the one who can satisfy us. When these come together there is an amzing explosion of feeling. All our desires become focused upon that person and we look, dazzled, into those beloved eyes and see - if only for a while - the summation of our own existence and a new world of happiness. Although we have seen that those longings may be darker and more complex xthan we might like to believe.<br /><br />...<br /><br />His (Schiller) ode <em>anticipation</em> (to which Schubert gave on of his finest settings) describes the thoughts and emotions of a lover sitting by a window, awaiting the arrival of his beloved; it is probably based on an experience of his waiting for Charlotte von Lengefeld, the woman he was soon to marry. At every moment a slight sound or movement in the garden makes him think she has come at last - but no, he realizes it was only the wind in the branches of the tress, an apple dropping in the orchard, or the glimmer of a swan on the lake. But in his disappointment he enjoys a stronger and surer grasp of his love for her. <br /><br />Why? Because anticipation, if conducted imaginatively (as it is here), doesn't just mean hanging around muttering: 'Where is she, when is she coming?' It involves thinking: 'Was that her footstep? I love the way she walks, she seems to carry herself so lightly.' that is it involves dwelling upon just what it is one is waiting for: the other comes alive under the benign influence of such thoughts. The lover, in this beautiful song, sees the whole of nature joining in his passion. He wants the trees to embrace her protectively, he wants the gentle breeze to enjoy the warmth of her cheeks; he begs night and silence to come quickly and provide the perfect sympathetic setting for their love. And he sees his own love as continuous with an eroticized nature: doesn't the wind kiss the flower; don't graps and pears swell under the loving influence of the sun?<br /><br />The way the lover uses nature in this poetic example has, of course, a distinguished cultural history. It was a major obsession of the era to see in nature a reflection of human passions; this in turn was a special deveopment of the medieval view which regarded all of nature in symbolic terms. But the interest of the ode, for me (John Armstrong), does not lie in the specific images employed. Rather it is the way in which the lover spins out - and enlarges - his passion by aligning it with whatever comes conveniently to hand. This is the opposite of the climax and discharge of passion which brings feeling to a close. On the contrary, imagination in this case seeks to keep the passion growing in the mind of the lover.<br /><br />...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Rain was coursing down the living-room window. J had gone into town an hour ago and I was about to head down the garden when a mass of black cloud hoved into view from the direction of Kallang and turned the drains into mad rushing streams and the canal a river.

No matter. I would do some painting.

It wasn't part of the plan. The plan was to finish the book or build an orphanage or even travel to corners of the world and naively think that I will somehow be able help someone less fortunate, earning a smile. But then, there was no harm resurrecting my dormant artistic skills before then. 

I dug the old stash in the corner for hard drawing paper, the ones that easily absorb water colour. Not that it mattered really, acrylic does little to paper. Found myself paint, the top hardened from age but the rudimentary shake - the way you would do a coke can to get it in someone's face,  was all it needed to tear the layer away. Two colours, green and yellow. 

After making a mug of green tea, settling down at the computer table wondering, why had I put this off for so long. The scent of old paper, the sticky plastic paint. I remember sitting in the corner of the art room, at seventeen and eighteen with a colour palette, dabbing dots on the pages as though it were a uniquely personal form of impressionism, attempting lines to no avail. The mix of the non-mixed paints as they merged while dabbing were fascinating, well at least the accents it created were. The edge of the cheap 1.30 paint brush, blunt from the constant tapping and stresses on the paper while I struggled with perspective, which till now, I barely am able to grasp. 

So I start off with the best 3D perspective outline of the orange in front of me. 'All circles are oval', Mr A used to say.

How often did I enjoy this gorgeous, furtive seclusion? In the bath mostly, or when I'm alone perhaps. Though it takes quite some time for anyone to truly understand this need for periodic isolation and the lack of it - while regularly dragging your senses to the shared reality, with the littlest of earthly distraction. 

And then I begin to dot in the shades of the whole orange.

Funny - well not funny in a funny way, to think that this was once what I had wanted to do with my life. Not oranges per se. But art in general. Abstract, mixed media, cross art forms, mixed multimedia art forms, there were more, the grander the better. Fit for a chapel exhibition or those museums with high white ceilings. Installations. Singapore never seem to create enough of that awe, that ambience and grandeur to make any (my!) majestic 'work of art' justifiable. I think it's the people. But that's my opinion. This dream though held no root to reality.

It was a bad painting. 

In truth, as always, overdone. Something about colours not blending so right. A slight miff and sigh and it was time to moved on to the next object, target. I don't like the word object. No, actually, I don't like the word objectify, object is safe.

So my second attempt was to be incredulously straightforward this time, to paint the wall behind the orange. Though now, thinking that blending a smooth cream colour wash over instead of the fail dots, (fail dots, heh) just didn't seem to be quite right without all the nuances of shadows and grainy paint work. I wasn't ever going to get this perfect balance. 

This just proves that reality was right along. Painting just wasn't going to be a sensible profession. Not if you wanted a decent salary and a decent non-dramatic, non-cliche gay life. Even the successful ones, the famous 'artsy' people you know about in Singapore's perpetual Arts Festival (I say that with a bit of irony and skepticism. I really do want someeday for the Arts here to take flight, better before I die) don't stay around very much, why or how or where or when, I do not know. 

My painting of the orange with dots created too much texture for its own good and the wall seemed too flat. They were both victims of a juxtaposed problem. The orange needed to be more smooth, the wall needed to be a bit dotty.

At this point, a man with no or little esteem would allow negative thoughts to enter his head, given that this man - I don't know, in Singapore, at what age do you call me a man, has in his mind many talents to share with the world who might, by some magically reason seem to need. But that was the whole point. To educate himself. To keep his mind alive, to keep it real. 

Just moments into this, I look up, and gaze through the window onto the neighbour's roof top. The bubble popped and I realise that, in my absence of the active world around me, the rain had ceased, the gentle soothing pitter-patter has subsided. No more rain to drown reality. The sun has come out and washed the world clean.

I tore the large attempt into little pieces, stamped it into the bottom of the waste paper basket, put on the bermudas and thongs and headed outside."

or where we're going, alone
in a world of the rat race
and pitiless renewing rubbles.

The angel is ... a beautiful man, with golden hair and wings, of course. I still dream about it. Many nights. I'm ... It's me. In that struggle. Fierce, and unfair. The angel is not human, and it holds nothing back, so how could anyone human win, what kind of fight is that? It's not just.

In real life, reading theatre and people and&nbsp; their scenarios are almost exactly alike, sans the intentional exageration. Except that in reality, there's a need to understand the existence of certain sign systems and what they mean anyway. How?&nbsp; You just have to have had experience or to find all that out for yourself some way or other. As human beings, some of us are made more sensitive than others (more EQ lah. the dense ones lugi lor, but its a double edged sword nonetheless). By that, we are able to read signs that happen around to us. Of course, our outlook in life predetermines our interpretation of these signs and more often than not, this is a form of communication. <br/><br/>When it comes to verbal communication: needless to say, talking is a huge sign system all on its own. But in a sense, this issue is not the crux of what I'm trying to express anyway.<br/>When it comes to body language: all sorts of sports, martial arts, dance and almost any form of movement characterizes a person.<br/>Some of us are just better at reading and understanding these signs than others. <br/><br/>(I can't really remember the point of my post lol...

Had the weirdest dream in a long while,
I only remember that there was some killing or loss of lives was&nbsp;involved. 
and it seemed like I was responsible for some of it.

See, the odd thing was I woke up mid way and went back to sleep.
But even as I was awake questions of whether it really happened surfaced
and continued on into my sleep. So I kept asking the people in my dream.

In the second dream, they were quite convincing that I've killed someone.
and then the dream shifted on to someone getting a death sentence,
concurrently with someone else with a (not very sensitive to say this out here) different offence.

Now as I am awake, the thoughts of that reality are slowly seeping away.
It's still raining."

Love is a central theme

Love is closely connected with

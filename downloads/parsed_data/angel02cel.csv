"event","Larry goes back to school on Sunday (or possibly Monday if I cry enough). I go back to school the following Sunday. This summer went by too quickly. Why did that 15 weeks pass by so quickly when the 15 weeks of school always passes by so slowly? I don't want to leave home, and I especially don't want to leave Larry... After Sunday, I'll have to go three weeks without him. Then I'll see him only 13 or 14 more times before December. Somehow, that seems oddly unfair."

"event","I have that stupid song stuck in my head, and it's worse than the Small World song. 

Since I'm going back to school soon and Mom's giving me a coffee maker, I decided that it's time to try to actually MAKE my own coffee instead of shelling out money at Dunkin Donuts and I must admit that for my first cup of home-brewed coffee (yes, I life a sheltered life), it wasn't half bad, although it was really strong and now I'm coming off the caffeine buzz and I'm not feeling too hot. I think another coffee might be needed to rectify the situation.

Um so yea, I need a new book to read. I wonder if I can convince Larry to take me to The Book Rack because they've got great (used) books for less than $5 and seeing as I'm on a tight budget for the rest of the summer, a nice cheap used book might come in handy and even though it's only a mile away from my house, I don't feel like driving, and walking's out of the question, and since it isn't Barnes and Noble, Larry can't complain, HA.... 

Good Lord coffee makes me hyper.... It's just those lazy-hazy-crazy days of summer...."

The drive home sucked. We left a little after 8 which meant we should've been home around 10:00, but traffic was backed up on 495 for about a mile. It was stop & go for awhile because they brought it down to one lane to do bridge work. On 290 in Worcester someone two cars in front of us in the fast lane slowed to a dead stop to take a right... The guy in front of us almost hit him, and Larry had to get within inches of that car because the guy in the minivan almost slammed the back of my geo. I thought I was going to lose my baby.

Anyway, that's my big project. Who knows when I'll get through with it. Who knows when I'll START it.

On the up side, I just ordered The Devil Wears Prada for my book collection. I checked it out from the library and decided it was so good that I'll prob end up reading it again, and it'd be easier for me to have my own copy. I had to special order it from B&N because I'll be damned if I have to read it again in paperback. I'm such a book snob. 

Hmm...

I miss Larry. He left here like 30 minutes ago, but I feel like it's been forever since I've seen him. He just called to say ""goodnight beautiful"" though, so I guess I can't complain. It's going to suck having to leave him to go back to school. I can tell I'm going to bawl my eyes out when he leaves (I think he starts a week before me. WPI likes to make EVERYBODY'S life miserable: the students AND their families, so they drag them away from us when the first opportunity presents itself, and from then on it's like ""FUCK YOU HE'S OURS"" and poof... my boyfriend is too busy for me). Yep, I'm definately gonna cry. I miss him already.

I wonder if he's going to get me anything for my birthday? He got me Phantom tix in May but maybe he loves me enough to get me something small and cute; something that says ""I love you"".... I guess I'll find out in 5 days."

"event","The Jeep went back to the shop yesterday. Larry got a flatbed to come pick it up and he dropped it off in Lowell last night. It was so sad to see that monster strapped to the back of a tow-truck. It brought back memories of the Cavalier, except the Jeep is a much better vehicle.

I was so excited when he got it back last week (ironically, he had it exactly a week before it went back). It's such a great truck; it purrs like a kitten when it idles and growls like a lion when it drives. I love it. The lift kit and the large tires make it stand like an animal that's ready to pounce, although they do make it IMPOSSIBLE for someone like me to get into it... I can't just step up because the door is about three inches higher than my thighs-- and that's with heels on, so it's probably really up to my hips... I've gotta do this half jump in order to grab the roll bar and hoist myself up (but that's half the fun, so I won't complain) 

Anyway, it's been sitting in the back of Chris Martin's yard for the last few days spewing fluids from every place possible every time it runs. In order to stop the gas leak from the carburator (sp?), they disconnected the gas line, although I think they flood it with gas in order to get it to start, then disconnect it again, so it runs all of five seconds before it stalls again. It took Larry a good 10 minutes to get it from the back of Chris's house to the driveway for the tow guy to pick it up. After the initial 5 minutes, I was starting to get worried.... ahh I miss that Jeep dammit... especially after I spent over $120 on it for Larry's birthday present"

But the only thing I can think of to get him with that shock value would be a new Jeep, and I'm a couple of hundred short for that, although I AM still considering it.

He keeps telling me he wants roll-bar pads and that's it. But since he got the Jeep back and it's not exactly working (yet), I told him I'd hold off on the pads until I'm POSITIVE he's going to be driving it and I'll get him something else for his bday and the pads when the Jeep's fixed, but he keeps saying ""no, just the roll-bar pads."" He's making my life extraordinarily difficult. So now I'm at a loss of what to get him. I want it to be practical, but it has to show how much I love him... hmm...

So anyway, that's my life. I have a paper due tomorrow, but I might not turn it in until Wednesday, that way I'll have half of today and half of Tues and Wed to work on it. Who knows, I'm getting lazy. But I think my professor will understand if I'm a few days late, esp. with everything that's going on (because if you keep them posted with what's going on, they'll be more lenient when you need extra time ;))

"event","I've got this whole summer reading thing going on for myself. At the beginning of the summer, I went to Barnes & Noble and bought a few books to keep myself busy. The list has since grown to 11 total, with more to be added as the summer progresses. So far, I've read ""Sula"" by Toni Morrison (which I'm using to write my summer independent study), ""I Am Charlotte Simmons"" by Tom Wolfe (it's nearly 700 pages long but it's one of the greatest books I've read in a long time), and ""Witness"" by Amber Frey. I'm debating whether or not I want to read the fourth and fifth book of the Harry Potter series because the next one is coming out in less than a month and Mom is already planning on buying it... I guess if I run out of things to read, I will.

Today I started ""The Other Woman"" by my favorite author, Jane Green. I'm trying to read a wide variety of books: biography, fiction, etc. I love reading. I am taking a creative writing course next year so I want to read as much as possible in order to prepare. I want to publish a book when I graduate (Larry says I should give it a shot, that I'll never know what happens unless I try), and I figure reading a lot will help me with that dream... *sigh*

Anyway, I'm supposed to be spending today writing my third summer paper (5-10 pgs, eek!) and reading my book so I must be going... Have a good week, all.

One month exactly til I turn 22... YIKES!"

I want to spend some quality time with Hassey, to drive around Dracut & Pelham aimlessly, to work and actually have MONEY, to go to the beach and read (without getting burned, there's wishful thinking), to spend time at the lake with mom & dad (on the boat with a book without getting burned-- do you see a trend here?).

I can't wait to spend some time with Larry... But dammit, I can't spend every available minute with him. I love him more than anything but I don't want to become one of those girls who can't live without her boyfriend. I can be independent and have fun. But grrr, I said the same thing about christmas break and look what happened then...

It's mother's day and I can't spend it with mom because I'm sick. She's coming to Ludlow to visit my grandmother too; I am missing out on a perfectly good visit all because I had to stress myself sick. I blame school... But school's almost out so I'm going to try not to harbor any resentment. I only have one year left, after all, I need to enjoy it. 

I started researching for my independent study. I haven't narrowed down a topic yet but I'm thinking on doing women's roles in literature. I need to focus on feminist theory, so we'll see how that works out. I looked up dissertations online yesterday to see examples of how to write a proposal and find a theory, etc. This is too much work already!! Haha.

I think I am going to get Harry Potter (Book IV) on CD because try as I might I can't seem to settle down long enough to get through it. I'm always distracted. The first time I attempted to read it, I had just finished Anna Karenina, which was 900 pages, and the thought of reading 700 pages of Harry Potter was such a turn-off. I tried reading it again during the semester, but tests and papers sprang up and ruined my motivation. I want to read the fifth book because the sixth book is coming out 3 days before my birthday, and I can't even get through the fourth!! GRRRR..."

"event","""You're beautiful."" She may not look like Nicole Kidman, but you should make her feel like Nicole Kidman. Don't just tell her she's beautiful when she's dressed up. Tell her first thing in the morning, or during a quiet moment when she's reading the newspaper.


""You're a great lover."" If you're lucky enough to have a woman who truly is a Professor of the Kama Sutra, good for you. Make sure you tell her how great her skills are. But if you'd like your woman to try something new, preface it by saying how great she is in bed already.
 
 
""You're so smart."" Studies have shown that in elementary school, girls begin to develop the belief that they shouldn't be smarter than the boys in the class. Most women get over this, but a little residual of this grade school lesson lurks around in the back of their minds. Be sure to tell her how much you value her greatest asset-her mind.


""You're my best friend."" Your woman wants to be your lover, but she also wants to be your friend. If your relationship is to last, this should be the truth, not just something you tell her.


""You're the most important thing to me."" Maybe you work late nights at the office. Maybe you like spending Saturday nights with the guys. Just make sure she knows she outranks everything.


""I would never lie to you."" And make sure this isn't a lie!


""I have never cheated on you."" Jealousy rears its ugly head from time to time. Make sure your woman knows she has no reason to suspect you.


""I'd be lost without you."" A woman wants to know (as Elvis sang), that you don't just want her and love her, you also NEED her.

"event","My room is so empty. The walls are bare, the fouton is gone, and most of my little knick-knacks are gone. Mom and dad came up last night and Larry helped us to move my stuff out. I'm sad to be leaving; I feel this way every year but that doesn't make it any less sad now. I have a lot of good memories from this place. Plus, I don't deal well with change, even if I'm going back home and moving into Evergreen Townhouses in the fall.... *sigh*

Larry left, but he's coming back Tuesday and he and I are moving the last of my stuff out Wed morning. I can't believe my junior year is virtually over.

I don't think I'm going to worry about finals anymore... I already know the bio so if I just keep reviewing before Monday morning's exam, I should be fine. My last 2 English papers are done and turned in, my psych final is done and waiting to be turned in, and my Engl Lang final shouldn't be too bad... and even if it is, I have an A in the class; I can fail the final completely and STILL pass the class, so I'm not going to stress.

I'm going to enjoy my last few days here. :o\"

"event","For my independent study in expository writing over the summer I have to write a 20-30 page paper on something having to do with womens roles in Contemporary American Literature. I have to narrow it down a bit because ""womens roles"" is a little broad, but I'm looking forward to it. My advisor wants me to write a more graduate (as opposed to undergraduate) paper; that is, I need to focus more on researching and developing my own ideas from research. I'm probably making it sound harder than it is. It's really 4 separate parts/papers: Proposal, Research, Theory, and Application, and the fifth paper is the final 20-30 pager. I have a sixth paper to write for that class, but it'll be considerably shorter and on a whole different topic; hopefully something that has NOTHING to do with literature. So much for being free and spending all my time reading non-school books."

I told him that I'd be doing that every night for the next week and he said he didn't care because it would help me to feel better... he's so sweet!! :o)"

I am so excited to get home; I re-worked my finals schedule to allow me to leave on Wednesday morning instead of Friday morning; that's just 10 days from now! (I need to do more packing!!!) I didn't feel like waiting til Friday so I switched my Thurs final to Tues figuring I'd have one Mon-Wed and I could leave Thurs morning, but then I realized I don't have a final exam on Wed, just a final paper due and since it's done, I can hand it in early and head out sooner. YAY! Finally my being an overachiever is paying off...

Mom and Daddy are coming up on Saturday or Sunday to move the fouton and take the majority of my crap home. Whatever is left here needs to be stuffed into the Geo, and whatever I can't fit, Larry said he'd take. But I really wanna fit everything in my car if possible... Hopefully I don't have too much crap.

I feel like shit, this sucks. I hope I'm not getting sick. 

The PA outing is today. I don't really want to go; Sundays are my days to relax and sit around and do nothing, and I really hate when people take that away from me. We're meeting at 4:00 so hopefully we'll be back by 9. Five hours is too long, IMO.

I miss my Larry... I can't wait to spend some time with him :o)"

Found out today that I don't have any finals after Tuesday next week so I'll be out of here by Wednesday morning. I need Larry to help me pack and move anything that doesn't fit in the geo. OMG I can't wait. Two whole extra days of vacation, YAY"

Took my 2nd bio lab test this morning. I don't think I did very well. At this point, I'm beyond caring. Only one more test for the semester before finals and it's in Psychology, so that could go either way. Only one more paper for the semester before finals and it's already written and revised.

Three finals to take: One on Monday, one that's a take home that's due Tuesday, one on Thursday and a final paper due Wednesday (that's already almost completely written). 

So basically, all I have to do is start studying tonight for finals so I don't put it all off to the last minute and stress...

It's just that for the last four days, I had a full kitchen, a living room with a nice big tv, a bathroom with a bathtub and not just a shower stall, and three immaculately decorated bedrooms. I felt like I was home while I was there. Until I came back this morning to this 10x12 foot cold, hard, cement-walled room. And I realized just how much I hate it here. No more tripping over animals as I walk, no more letting the dog out to ""do his business,"" no more sleeping with the dog curled at the foot of my bed while the cat slides down the hallway at all hours of the night playing with her toy. I'm alone here again, and I hate it."

On Friday I spent time with Larry as usual and on Saturday, he and I went to my parents' lakehouse since this was the first weekend it was open for the summer season. It was SO beautiful this weekend. Hopefully Larry and I can go up there alot this summer, but if we do I'll have to remember to bring the sunblock because I got burned! I told mom that's how you know it's cottage season: when the sun is strong enough to burn you this badly! Haha.

Larry came down on Friday with a gift for me-- he bought me a pink WPI sweatshirt, I was so excited! haha. Such a great boyfriend I have...I miss him. :o)

So I'm glad I had such a good weekend to get me through this next week... I'll be red until at least Wednesday/Thursday. I'm not sure yet but I think I might go back to the cottage on Sunday; I need to start packing to move out so I'll prob. bring the boxes to the cottage so mom & dad can bring them home. 

Ahh, I hate Sunday nights. It's good tv-wise, but it sucks to realize that there's a whole week of classes and such. Mondays suck!! Oh well, that's college.

I can't wait to see Larry again! Haha... at least now, with the sunburned face, I don't have to wear makeup...He always tells me I'm more beautiful without it; at least with some natural color, it's easier to believe him!"

"event","I had an absolutely fabulous weekend! On Friday I went to Worcester with Larry; I just couldn't get away from this shithole fast enough. We cooked dinner, watched a movie, and hung around the apartment as usual. Worcester's growing on me, it's not such a bad place to be anymore. On Saturday after we got home, I convinced him to let me hang out with him at his friend Chris's. So we went home, I showered and got ready, and we headed up to Pelham. When we got there, Chris had his Jeep in the driveway with no top on (since it was a really beautiful day); they took the doors off after we showed up, and Chris let Larry take me for a ride in it while they all went on the quads out back. I would've gone on one too, but Alissa and Gina had gotten SO muddy from the trails that I backed out, good thing too because Larry went through a HUGE mud puddle and got himself covered. If I were with him, I'd have been his shield and I would've been the one to walk in covered in mud. Anyway, yea... The Jeep ride was alot of fun, although somewhat cold!! :o)

Went to Billiards that night after putting the roof back on the Jeep, but it was 21+ and only 1/2 of us were over 21, so we went to Wendy's and got massive amounts of food (which reminds me...Larry & Chris got the chili... Apparently some woman somewhere in the country bit into a human finger that was found in Wendy's chili. I'll have to tease him about that later, haha). 

Had a nice chat with my brother last night when I got home, too. Or rather, when HE got home cuz he was out later than I was. I haven't really talked to him because he's been on Spring Break, so it was a good chance to catch up. Came to Ludlow with the family(minus Jeff cuz he had to drive back to RI this morning) for Easter dinner and now, unfortunately, I'm back at WNEC. I'm trying to remain positive and optimistic (I know; it's against my better judgement), because there's only six weeks of classes left... seven weeks til summer if you include the week of finals, so it's really not long at all til I get back to being myself. I can't wait to be home. I think I might go home at least 2 more weekends (hopefully 3) just to have something to look forward to. I'm so much happier at home. 

Anyway, this weekend put alot of things into perspective for me. I had a chance to take a step back from everything that's been going on lately so that I could look at it objectively, and I realize it's not even worth my time to worry about it anymore. I know who I can trust and who will always be there for me, so whatever. I'm happy again, that's all that matters..."

When Jen went in to wash the dishes and get ready for bed, Joey took me out around Mt. Vernon to teach me how to drive his F150 cuz it's standard. I figured that the lil circle and no traffic would be a good place to attempt it. It was SOOOOO scary! I freaked out and almost broke it. But on the bright side, I didn't stall it, haha. He kept telling me to let up on the clutch and when I felt it catch, hit the gas. And so I TRIED to take his advice, but the car didn't so much catch as it did lurch. And it was like I completely forgot how to drive a car; I was so focused on getting it to move, I forgot I needed to actually steer it. Haha. By the time I got to the end of Jen's street, I started freaking out because it's not like an automatic, I couldn't just hit the brake and stop. I had to depress the clutch and hit the brake while downshifting... It's all very confusing. I think I'll leave driving a standard to people like Joey, those that can actually do it."

"event","I'm gonna have to do something about this not having food thing. I left the cottage this morning to head back to WNEC and I completely forgot to eat something. It's now 1:28 and I'm starving. Woops. 

Mom and I moved half of my stuff into C-Wealth yesterday. The rain held off, thankfully, until we were finished unloading the Geo. Since Dad was in NY for the weekend, I went back to the cottage and spent the night there. Mom & I got dinner and headed out to Wal-Mart just for the hell of it. I made a list of everything I want her to get me @ Wal-Mart in Hudson-- tax free. I came back to WNEC this morning to unpack everything so that I could repeat the process when Dad comes up after dinner tonight to unload whatever I have in the back of his truck. 

I wish I was smart and switched to Merrimack when I had the chance; I wouldn't have to move so far away from home."

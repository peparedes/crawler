"event","<font size=""2"">My parents are pissed at me. I walked in the house this evening and they didn't even acknowledge me. How screwed up is that?</font><p>Would you like to know what I did to warrant this treatment? I spent the night at Ray's house and was honest about it.</p><p>I always spend weekends with him. I've been doing it for weeks now. She already knew I was out with him for the evening, so I just decided to tell her that I was staying with Ray. She sent me a text back that said, &quot;I would like you to come home please.&quot; I thought, &quot;Okay, well ... no thank you.&quot; A few seconds afterward, she calls. She sounded perfectly pleasant on the phone, asking me if I had fun at my two parties. Then she asked to speak to Ray. I said, &quot;What?&quot; She repeated herself. I said, &quot;Ray is outside with the dog at the moment.&quot; She said, &quot;That's fine, I'll wait until he comes back in.&quot; Ray came around the corner and I said, &quot;Hold on, he's right here.&quot; I timidly handed him the phone and he mouthed, &quot;Who is it?&quot; I mouthed, &quot;Mom. She wants to talk to you.&quot; He mouthed, &quot;Shit, no!&quot; But then he immediately took the phone and said, &quot;Hello?&quot; I could really only hear his end of the conversation, but I could hear my mom's voice. She sounded pleasant enough. She asked him what we had done with our evening, he told her, and then he said, &quot;I will do my best ... Yes m'am ... Okay ... bye.&quot; CLICK! I was standing in the doorway to the kitchen silently laughing out of nervousness. I said, &quot;Well? What did she say?&quot; He said, &quot;She asked me to encourage you to go home ... I told her I would do my best, so ... I encourage you to go home.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh. Well I'm going up to bed.&quot;</p><p>Of course I felt guilty about it. That's what I do. I wasn't going to be able to sleep well unless I said something back to her. I sent her a text that said, &quot;Please don't guilt trip me. I'm 23 years old. I don't want to make you mad or disrespect you, but I wish you would let me make my own choices.&quot; She didn't say anything back to me, but I felt better.</p><p>I called the house this afternoon at Ray's insistence (to try and gauge how my mom was feeling) but my dad answered the phone. He didn't say anything, but he sounded kind of ... not happy to talk to me. We made conversation and I asked where mom was. She went into work. I decided not to call her there. I didn't really want to talk to her if I didn't have to. I realized that my main goal was to make contact and I did that. She ended up calling me a few minutes later. She didn't bring it up, but she definitely sounded upset. It could have been because of the house not selling and the house down the street getting three offers after being on the market for five minutes ... but I'm pretty sure it was me.</p><p>And then I came home this evening. They were both downstairs watching House. I went in and said hello. I busied myself making a fiber water, but neither of them got up, said a word, or even moved. House is a good show, but it ain't that good. So, I'm guessing they're pissed at me still.</p><p>Before I started typing this, my mom came in in a flurry and practically shoved a stack of papers at me and said, &quot;This bill is due on the 20th.&quot; And then she rushed back out again. I don't really know how mad she is, but there is definitely some sort of inner struggle going on inside her brain.</p><p>But I'm not going to worry about it. I said what I needed to say and as neither of them seem like they're going to broach the subject, I'm going to forget it. Of course, I'm sure my mom will say something tomorrow morning when my dad isn't here ... if she's decided to start talking to me by then.</p><p>I met one of Ray's ex-girlfriend's last night at the birthday party of his co-worker, Alicyn (yeah, weird). She was pretty, but a bit bottom heavy so I felt better about my life. Her name is Kristen. I didn't know who she was at first when we were first introduced, so luckily I came off as perfectly pleasant. I smiled, said it was nice to meet her, and blah blah. I tried to engage her in conversation thinking that she was just some other girl he worked with. After a few minutes, I realized that she looked familiar ... I had seen a picture of her and Ray together on Matt's FB page. It still didn't really bother me because, as I said, I didn't feel threatened. And I'm always going on about how I can't stand when my ex-boyfriends girlfriends don't like me just because I'm the ex when I'm really nothing to be concerned about. I figured that she wasn't worth my worry. And I know I have Ray completely.</p><p>The police showed up around 11:30 because someone called in a noise complaint. Everyone in the living room rushed to the front door to be a part of the action. Well, everyone except for me, Kristen, and her boyfriend. Ray went immediately to the door and started being boisterous. Kristen kept scolding him and telling him to be quiet. I didn't say anything, but her need to get his attention wasn't lost on me. She would laugh the loudest at his jokes and say, &quot;Oh, Ray.&quot; Again, didn't bother me, but it was something I noticed. She's clearly not over him.</p><p>Ray and I left pretty soon after that and we had to have the obligatory discussion about her. The night before Ray and I met, he said that he had &quot;hooked up&quot; with her. Hooking up in this case meaning that he kissed her. So that was just three months ago. And then he just kept talking. He mentioned another girl that he hooked up with that night, only hooking up in her case meant banging her up against a wall at the Brewery.</p><p>I have to tell you, when he said that to me my insides went cold. I could feel my face just go slack from shock, and I had been smiling prior to that moment. He spent the whole ride home explaining himself despite the fact that I told him that he didn't have to ... because he doesn't. Whatever he did before me is before me ... but I couldn't help but resent his bad choices. I didn't want to hear that. And he just kept going!! He wanted to get everything out because he told me that he has no regrets and no skeletons and he wants me to understand what was going on at the time. He explained that he normally doesn't behave that way. He hadn't been with a girl in 18 months prior to that and all in one night they cascaded upon him ... and I suppose what guy wouldn't take advantage of that opportunity? And then the next night he met me and after that point, none of those girls mattered to him. He only kissed Kristen that night because he thought that she was single and as soon as he saw her boyfriend walk in he told her to go away.</p><p>He broke up with her because she was bossy and he dreaded spending time with her. He kept telling me that I'm infinitely better than any girl he's ever been with in every way and that he loves me more than anything. He told me not to give any of those girls a second thought because I'm who he wants to be with forever.</p><p>Way, way, WAAAAY too much honesty.</p><p>I contemplated telling him about Ryan Zezeski, but even now the timing doesn't feel right. And it would only explain why I didn't fall in love with him right away. The night before I met him, I was NOT kissing or having sex with exboyfriends. After he was finished explaining everything, I said, &quot;You know, the worst part of that for me was hearing how you had a girl up against a wall. I don't ever want to think of you being with another girl like that, even if it WAS before me.&quot; He said he was sorry that he told me, but he doesn't regret doing it. He says that he made a choice and that while it was a dumb one, he can't take it back.</p><p>I feel closer and closer to him all of the time. I don't like certain things about his past exploits, but what can I do? I'm not going to hold it over his head when clearly the most important thing is that he's crazy about me!</p><p>~Ali <br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p><strong>Tuesday, December 23, 2008</strong>, I got to sleep in a little bit, thankfully, but not for long.&nbsp; I had an interview at Delta T (in person!) at 9AM.&nbsp; I got there and was greeted by a jolly fellow named Ben.&nbsp; He reminded me of Dan, but with more hair on top of his head.&nbsp; He showed me into a room and told me that he was new to the job so he didn't really know what he was doing yet.&nbsp; Surprisingly, I felt comforted by that fact.&nbsp; He gave me a Wonderlic test and told me that it was silly, but it had to be done.&nbsp; It's not the first time I've seen it, so I guess it's whatever!&nbsp; He left the room and I filled out the obligatory personal information.&nbsp; At the bottom of that page, it said, &quot;Wait for the instructor to return before beginning&quot;.&nbsp; I thought, &quot;Oh, shit.&nbsp; Did Ben say that he was coming back?&nbsp; Should I wait?&nbsp; Should I go ahead anyway?&quot;&nbsp; Either way, if I was wrong I was screwed.&nbsp; It would clearly demonstrate my inability to listen to and follow directions. End of interview.&nbsp; I waited for a few minutes and then decided to just go for it.&nbsp; After I had been working at it for a few minutes, Ben came in and asked if things were going okay.&nbsp; I thanked my lucky stars!&nbsp; A few minutes later, he came in with another guy (NAMED FUCKING RYAN!!) and we started the interview.&nbsp; This Ryan was older and married, so therefore I wasn't as harassed as I would have been normally, but enough already.&nbsp;</p><p>While Ben was out, he left his notebook open.&nbsp; I peeked over at it and noticed that there were interview questions displayed there.&nbsp; I looked through them, of course (and wouldn't YOU want to know what was coming?) and felt comfortable with all of them except for one.&nbsp; It asked me to give them an example of a situation in which I had to deal with a deadline.&nbsp; I racked my brain for an example.&nbsp; Usually nothing I do is ever of any consequence.&nbsp; The best I could come up with was working at the tea house and turning the house around in an hour for the next tea.&nbsp; It's as good an example as any, I guess.&nbsp; The world WOULD have ended.&nbsp; They seemed content with that answer anyway.&nbsp; They seemed impressed enough with me (and let's face it: who wouldn't be?) and they told me that someone would be in contact with me.&nbsp; I certainly hope so.&nbsp; I want this job.&nbsp; If I don't get it, I KILL YOU!</p><p>Donna Cohen came over to look at our house.&nbsp; We're putting it on the market January 5, so if you want a hizzy, buy this one so I can keep my room.&nbsp; I'll make dinner.&nbsp; She went through the house and suggested ways that would help it sell better.&nbsp; We're getting new carpet and a new stove.&nbsp; Gas range with a microwave above it.&nbsp; My mom is beside herself.&nbsp; She's going to give herself a stroke.&nbsp; I can't wait for this to be over either because she's stressing ME out and I don't even have anything to worry about.&nbsp; I don't think.</p><p>Aunt Kay came over a little later and we hung out for a bit.&nbsp; She brought me over some stuff for my face.&nbsp; I haven't used it yet because I don't want it interfering with anything else I'm on, and by that I mean I don't want my face to explode in redness and then peel off.&nbsp; I've been lucky so far in that there has been minimal peeling and no redness at all and I'd like to keep it that way.&nbsp; Things are becoming manageable again and I no longer want to claw my skin off.&nbsp;</p><p>I putzed around the house until it was party time.&nbsp; I showed up around 7:15 thinking that I would be ridiculously early (since the party started at 7:30) but there were a few people there already.&nbsp; Everyone saw my dress and said, &quot;Wow, Ali!&quot;&nbsp; I had warned them all ahead of time that I was going to be dressing up, so I didn't feel completely stupid, but I was definitely overdressed.&nbsp; Well, the shoes made it over dressed.&nbsp; I had started baking my sandwich when ZeZe arrived.&nbsp; I don't think he saw me right away.&nbsp; He didn't say anything, but out of the corner of my eye, I could see him . . . do a physical &quot;woah&quot;.&nbsp; Yeah, he got an eyeful.&nbsp; And I pranced around like la ti da!!&nbsp; I saw a book on the counter titled, &quot;What if&quot;, and it's basically a book of questions asking what people would do in certain situations.&nbsp; I kept it close to my person in case conversation lapsed.&nbsp; The party, for me, really didn't get started until Zach arrived.&nbsp; He brought Derrick.&nbsp; The two of them and Mark were pretty much my best friends for the whole evening.&nbsp; They made me laugh so much that I cried, and I was so thankful because I didn't notice Ryan as much.&nbsp; I did notice him, though.&nbsp; He's beautiful.&nbsp; His build is just so perfect.&nbsp; I could look at him for hours . . . with or without clothes.&nbsp; Clothes optional.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; He's manly in all the right places.&nbsp; He finally shaved his face.&nbsp; I almost wish that he wouldn't because being clean shaven makes him look much more stunning and I don't want other girls looking at him.&nbsp; Oh, god damnit I feel like I had a relapse.</p><p>ANYWAY, so I was sitting on the couch with my three amigos and we were answering questions from the &quot;what if&quot; book.&nbsp; It was absolute hilarity.&nbsp; I had a SOLO cup full of wine, but I handed it to Mark because I was done with it for the time being.&nbsp; A few minutes later, out of no where, wine is cascading into Mark's lap and onto my dress.&nbsp; It wasn't a huge catastrophe (since my dress was already red to begin with), but Mark looked like he got his period.&nbsp; It was absolutely strategic and I nearly fell to the floor with laughter.&nbsp; Mark had a pair of gym shorts in his car, so he was able to change his pants and put them in the wash.&nbsp;</p><p>Once all of my Journey group kids were there (there were a couple of extra people) I passed around cards.&nbsp; I bought cards for everyone (including HIM) and I wrote them each a little note.&nbsp; They mostly centered around me being glad that we were friends.&nbsp; Some of them were more meaningful than others.&nbsp; Jessica, especially.&nbsp; She brought me to the Journey group in the first place.&nbsp; Karen because she has helped me deal with Ryan's presence . . . Surprisingly, Ryan's card didn't have a meaningful message in it.&nbsp; I didn't mean for it to.&nbsp; He never replied to the email I wrote him nearly a week ago and I really had nothing to say.&nbsp; What could I have said?&nbsp; In any case, I don't want to pour out my soul in a Christmas card.&nbsp; They don't make them big enough.&nbsp; So, I said, &quot;I hope you're doing well and that your family is happy and healthy.&nbsp; Give ol' Bandie Wandie a pat on the head for me.&nbsp; Merry Christmas, Pooks!&quot;&nbsp; I debated for a long time whether or not I was going to throw a pet name in there.&nbsp; Despite all of the heartache I've been through, I don't want him to feel guilty . . . because that's the kind of twisted person I am.&nbsp; I didn't say &quot;Love, Ali&quot; because I felt that would be too much.&nbsp; I used Pooks because I want him to know that I still care for him and that he's still my Pooks.&nbsp; I think that says more than &quot;Love, Ali&quot;.&nbsp; I wrote that on everyone else's card, but his is special.&nbsp; I know it has to be difficult for him to gauge how I feel about him considering that I told him I pretty much can't stand the sight of him . . . I'm all about making things easier on everyone but myself.</p><p>Once everyone had eaten (and everyone LOOOOOOOVED my sandwich . . . oh, I could just melt from the joy of it!) we adjourned into the empty living room (because Jess is moving too!) and we played Hoopla!&nbsp; It's too much to explain, but it's a type of Cranium.&nbsp; It's like charades to the nth degree.&nbsp; I was pretty terrible at it.&nbsp; How are you supposed to explain &quot;telemarketing&quot; using alliteration??&nbsp; Oh, but here's the one I did for Cleopatra: &quot;Egyptian, elite, estrogen&quot; and BAM!&nbsp; They got it.&nbsp; It was a fun game.&nbsp; I had been sharing beers with Derrick for a while, and the wine was starting to kick in.&nbsp; I felt good.&nbsp; Sometimes when I would smile, I would look at Ryan, and he would sometimes be smiling back at me.&nbsp; Oh, this evening was further complicated by the fact that Derrick was blatantly flirting with me . . . and I would blatantly flirt back.&nbsp; Although, he did bite me at one point and I was astounded at this.&nbsp; I would tickle him, but it really wasn't that fun.&nbsp; I had the feeling that he would break off my fingers if I continued for more than a second.&nbsp; But it made me happy to be surrounded by all of those boys.&nbsp; I'm sorry, I'm an attention whore, they were cute, and they were (surprisingly, considering how I invited it) respectful of boundaries.&nbsp; Derrick even had his arm around me at one point while we were on the couch.&nbsp; I enjoyed their company.&nbsp; I know they all probably had other things on their mind, but they never voiced it, they never did anything, and I was so happy.&nbsp; They made me laugh to the point of tears.&nbsp;</p><p>The evening went by way too quickly.&nbsp; After two games of Hoopla, Jess went to bed, but she told us that we could stay as long as we wanted to.&nbsp; I could have stayed all night.&nbsp; I didn't want to leave.&nbsp; The rest of us went back into the family room and played &quot;what if&quot;.&nbsp; Derrick read a few questions and then passed the book to me.&nbsp; Earlier, I read to myself the question, &quot;What is the most important quality in a mate?&quot;&nbsp; And I knew that if I had a chance to ask it while Ryan was around to hear it, I wanted to do it.&nbsp; So I found the question again and I read it aloud.&nbsp; Derrick answered &quot;faithfulness&quot;.&nbsp; I started to say something, but then someone interjected.&nbsp; Once they had finished, I was about to forget the whole thing when Ryan (of all people) said, &quot;What were you about to say?&quot;&nbsp; I said, &quot;Oh, I was just going to say that I think the most important trait is devotion.&quot;&nbsp; Derrick said, &quot;Faithfulness is the same thing.&quot;&nbsp; I said, &quot;Well . . . then I'm glad we're on the same page.&quot;&nbsp; But faithfulness and devotion really isn&rsquo;t the same thing.&nbsp; You can be faithful without being devoted.&nbsp; I would say loyalty and faithfulness is the same thing.&nbsp; I am loyal and faithful to Carla in that if she ever, for some unforeseeable reason, breaks up with Chris, I will be on her side no matter what.&nbsp; I wouldn't say I'm devoted to her in that if she killed a man, I would take the fall for her.&nbsp; I would try to justify her actions so that she didn't have to go to prison, but that's one ride she'll have to take on her own cuz I ain't goin!&nbsp; I think devotion implies so much more and I get all these crazy ideas from my damn Twilight books.&nbsp; Edward is devoted to Bella.&nbsp; It just implies this deep, unwavering love.&nbsp; I don't think I've ever experienced devotion.&nbsp; Faithfulness, definitely . . . but I've never met anyone that I would die for.&nbsp; Sure, if for whatever reason someone wanted to kill me and they said, &quot;If you don't give yourself up, I will kill your best friend or someone else that you love,&quot; I would give myself up and die.&nbsp; But it's really hard for me to sit here and think that if someone random had a gun pointed at someone else, I would try to step in front of them.&nbsp; I don't know if I'm explaining this the way that I would like to, but devotion is heavier than faithfulness in my mind.&nbsp; If you're devoted to someone, you don't get divorced.&nbsp; If you're faithful to someone, you wait until you're divorced to have sex with someone else.&nbsp; But I wanted Ryan to hear my answer.&nbsp; I don't know why . . . I couldn't possibly be devoted to him.&nbsp; I'm in love with him, sure . . . but I know I will fall out of love eventually.&nbsp; I think/hope I will, anyway.&nbsp; I'm too hopelessly romantic for my own good.</p><p>Around 1:30, Ryan hinted that we should all get going.&nbsp; We cleaned up and packed up as best as we could.&nbsp; I hugged everyone, Derrick twice, and Ryan was last.&nbsp; He's always last and a part of me is glad that he is.&nbsp; After things were done on Tuesdays, when we were dating, he would always be the last to hug me.&nbsp; It's special.&nbsp; He's special.&nbsp; As he hugged me, he said, &quot;Merry Christmas, Ali.&nbsp; Thank you for the card.&quot;&nbsp; I said, &quot;You're welcome.&nbsp; Merry Christmas, Ryan.&quot;&nbsp; I love when he says my name.&nbsp; It's something so important and significant.&nbsp; Whenever a guy says my name I feel like it's something special.&nbsp; He wants to command my attention and whatever he is saying is meant specifically for me.&nbsp; This time was extra special because not only did he say my name, but he softened his voice, like he only wanted me to hear.&nbsp; In recent weeks, our goodbyes have been loud and rather obnoxious.&nbsp; I know I'm going to see and hear what I want to see and hear, but no one can tell me otherwise that this moment was special.&nbsp; I've only just realized that I don't actually hug him.&nbsp; When people normally hug, their head goes over the other persons shoulder.&nbsp; You're facing front.&nbsp; When I hug Ryan, my head turns sideways so that the side of my face is pressed up against the upper part of his chest.&nbsp; I don't hug Ryan . . . I hold Ryan and I haven't even realized that I've been doing it.&nbsp; I wonder if he notices that I do that.&nbsp; And a part of me wishes that one time he would linger just a second too long.&nbsp; I hate how he pulls away.&nbsp; I mean, he hugs me normally, but I want him to hold me.&nbsp; At least, I think I do.&nbsp; If he were to do that, which would just open up all sorts of cans of worms . . . but I'd be willing to take the risk.</p><p>I'm in a very dangerous position right now.&nbsp; I feel like I need to wait for Ryan to come around.&nbsp; I feel like I was robbed of something special.&nbsp; I feel like something was severed and torn from me.&nbsp; And Ray just makes me nervous.&nbsp; He is absolutely sweet, cute, hysterical, and I can tell he already cares for me immensely . . . more so than any normal person should.&nbsp; Considering how I feel at this moment in time, if I were in a relationship with Ray and Ryan came to me and said, &quot;I want to give us another try&quot;, I would have no problem ending things with Ray.&nbsp; I want Ryan.&nbsp; Ryan feels like my missing piece.&nbsp; Ray is certainly a distraction and he fills the void that Ryan left, but he's not Ryan.&nbsp; He's just holding me together.&nbsp; I need to be careful with Ray.&nbsp; I know I could hurt him.&nbsp; And God knows that Ray would be good for me.&nbsp; I have so much fun with him . . . but I know if life sees fit to give me another chance with Ryan, I need to take it.&nbsp; But how do I live my life around that?&nbsp; I can't use Ray as a crutch.&nbsp; I can't use ANY guy as a crutch . . . someone to be discarded if Ryan ever wakes up.&nbsp; I'm in a terrible position right now.&nbsp; I don't need to make a decision now, and I plan on being completely honest with Ray if our relationship hits that next level, but I'm afraid.&nbsp; I'm afraid to close the door on Ryan because at this moment, everything I do is just something to do until he comes back.&nbsp; And I know for a fact that if Ryan had never come along and shook my tree, I would be completely happy with Ray.&nbsp; He threw his own little pickle into things!&nbsp; And if I didn't know that he still liked me this wouldn't be so difficult.&nbsp; I know he does and that makes this all so much harder.&nbsp; If I knew he didn't want me I would just say, &quot;Fuck you&quot; and be completely at peace with Ray.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Difficult are my relationships.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wednesday, December 24, 2008</strong>, Crab Shanty sums up today pretty well.&nbsp; I ate some delicious crab cakes.&nbsp; Ray went up to Philadelphia to be with his sister.&nbsp; He ate Lithuanian food, which apparently is the least delicious thing ever.&nbsp; I had planned on going to church, but I would have been late and I didn't know anyone who was going anyway so I didn't feel like bothering.&nbsp; I went to bed early since I hadn't been sleeping much the past couple of days.&nbsp; Being busy will do that.</p><p><strong>Thursday, December 25, 2008</strong>, CHRISTMAS!!!&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised with everything.&nbsp; This was the first year that I didn't make a list.&nbsp; I didn't think to make one and this is mostly because I had no idea what to ask for.&nbsp; Turns out I did myself a huge favor!&nbsp; Sam got me a Nintendo DS and two games: LEGO INDY AND STAR WARS 1!!!&nbsp; My eyes sparkled with joy!&nbsp; I got all my Legos!!!&nbsp; Best games ever!!&nbsp; I don't care what you say!&nbsp; I like running around picking up studs and building with Lego pieces.&nbsp; Then my parents got me a GPS and an iTouch.&nbsp; I was shocked.&nbsp; I've never owned so much as an old school, thick as a phone book iPod and now I have this beautiful iTouch?&nbsp; I had no idea I wanted one until I held it in my arms and crowned it my Crazy Cool Music Box.&nbsp; The GPS just pisses me off.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll appreciate it more when I actually go somewhere unfamiliar.&nbsp; After dinner at Judy's, I put in my address to go home and it had me taking Liberty Road somewhere instead of I-70.&nbsp; You can recalculate all you want, you jerk, but we're going this way!!</p><p>So dinner was at 3.&nbsp; Sam and I played Guitar Hero while everyone watched.&nbsp; I was awesome, but then Sam had me play on medium and I discovered that I have a weak pinkie.&nbsp; I have no control over that blue button and I might as well just mash my face against them for all the good it does.&nbsp; Alan had a fantastic spread as always.&nbsp; He makes awesome potatoes.&nbsp; They are so creamy and delicious!&nbsp; We opened presents after dinner.&nbsp; Well, granddad opened presents.&nbsp; He's so spoiled!&nbsp; It rained Christmas on his head.&nbsp; My parents had to make an early exit because my dad's eye had swollen to the size of a baseball.&nbsp; He's allergic to cats and my aunt owns three of them.&nbsp; They're horrible, but I'm not allowed to say a word against them.&nbsp; My dad, enjoying animals as much as he does, can't resist petting them, and then apparently rubbing the&nbsp; crap out of his eye.&nbsp; This happens every year, but this is the worst I've ever seen it.&nbsp; He looked like someone socked him in the eye.&nbsp; It's too bad they left because right afterwards we had dessert.&nbsp; Alan made lava cakes and apple pie.&nbsp; I decided to eat a lava cake since I knew I was going to get some pie to take home.&nbsp; The cake was insanely rich.&nbsp; I thought I was going to puke.&nbsp; I ate the whole thing, though.&nbsp; I was a right piglet.&nbsp; Lindsay and Dan came in at some point.&nbsp; We watched her open her presents from the morning since she wasn't there.&nbsp; That tends to happen with families after divorce, I suppose . . . although her dad is in the Bahamas, so I don't know where she was.&nbsp; She got a lot of nice stuff.&nbsp; Mostly boots, jewelry, and a purse big enough to fit a small dog and/or baby.&nbsp; I asked her what the hell she put in it and she said, &quot;My LIFE&quot;.&nbsp; Yes, yes, that's all well and good, but what does that entail, exactly?&nbsp; Textbooks?&nbsp; Photo albums?&nbsp; Car manual?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I carry my wallet, cellphone, and keys.&nbsp; If the situation calls for it, I may throw in some sun glasses.&nbsp; What else do you need?&nbsp; I'm seriously intrigued.</p><p>After Lindsay's presents, Sam and I took our leave.&nbsp; She had business to take care of (haha! Inside joke!)&nbsp; We went to the movies and saw &quot;Desperaux&quot;.&nbsp; It was entertaining and it really made me feel bad for rats.&nbsp; One day while I was babysitting Joey, I watched Ratatouille three times through.&nbsp; I'm not kidding.&nbsp; When your babysitting, babies tend to demand your attention at inopportune moments, so I would miss certain parts of the movie.&nbsp; I would watch the movie over again to see the parts I missed.&nbsp; It's also just a good movie and it made me feel bad for rats.&nbsp; Granted, this one could cook a mean dish, but still.&nbsp; I don't mind rats and mice.&nbsp; I mean, I would prefer to find mouse in my house rather than a rat, but I wouldn't throw shit at it.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; How often does THAT work?</p><p><strong>Friday, December 26, 2008</strong>, This is date night.&nbsp; I had nothing to do all day but anticipate it.&nbsp; I asked Ray what the plan was and he said, &quot;Dinner, movie, drinks?&quot;&nbsp; I was immediately thrown into a panic, but I took control.&nbsp; I said, &quot;I'm going to be honest, I'm not a big dinner person.&nbsp; It's a long, ridiculous story, so can we just do movie and drinks?&quot;&nbsp; He said, to my surprise, &quot;You're cute!&nbsp; No problem, movie and drinks it is.&quot;&nbsp; And do you know, I didn't feel ill the whole night!&nbsp; He picked me up around 6:30 and we made our way to the mall.&nbsp; We saw &quot;The Spirit&quot;.&nbsp; We were one of the first people in the theater, but it filled up quickly.&nbsp; I saw Brandon, so that was cool.&nbsp; By the time the movie started, we were squeezed in between people.&nbsp; I don't like that.&nbsp; I want space when I see a movie.&nbsp; I know we can't always get it, but poo.&nbsp; The movie was okay.&nbsp; I guess I'd have to read the comic to fully appreciate it.&nbsp; The Spirit was sexy as all hell.&nbsp; I mean, what a man can do with a black suit, solid red tie, dark hair, and blazing blue eyes.&nbsp; Ideal man: bright blue eyes and dark hair . . . a genetic rarity, but so delicious.</p><p>After the movie, I made an executive decision and decided to go to Champps since it seems more bar than restaurant.&nbsp; I didn't want the intimate atmosphere of the Cheesecake Factory, nor the Chinesey-ness of P.F. Changs.&nbsp; I figured it wouldn't look as weird if I just ordered a drink.&nbsp; But, as it was, I did get something to eat.&nbsp; Ray was surprised.&nbsp; We've only been on one real date and I already have him conditioned to say, &quot;You're going to eat something?&quot;&nbsp; With a satisfied air of surprise.&nbsp; I also got a LIIT.&nbsp; It was one of the best I've ever had.&nbsp; It didn't taste alcoholy, but it tasted like Sweet and Sour, for some reason.&nbsp; It wasn't very strong.&nbsp; And I should know!&nbsp; I saw Adam and Jennifer from my outing with Mark.&nbsp; I was so happy that they remembered me.&nbsp; Jennifer actually came over to say hi.&nbsp; She and Adam were seeing a later showing of &quot;The Spirit&quot;.&nbsp; I told her of the impending sexiness of the Spirit, but she said, &quot;I'm more interested in the girl candy.&quot;&nbsp; I said, &quot;Oh.&nbsp; Well, they're impressive too.&quot;&nbsp; You get to see Eva Mendes booty and I will admit that it's glorious.&nbsp; I don't know how she gets it to round and pert, but I could only hope for a butt like that.&nbsp; Mine is only the way that it is because I haven't had kids yet.&nbsp; It's doomed to destruction within the next five years (?)&nbsp; Maybe.</p><p>We went back to my house and we hung out for a while.&nbsp; We watched the Jackass movie.&nbsp; He looks like Steve-O and I'm not the first person to say so.&nbsp; We had a head fight and he won.&nbsp; His head is like a rock.&nbsp; He actually knocked on it and it sounded absurdly hollow.&nbsp; I don't know how to explain it, but it didn't sound like anything I'd ever heard before.&nbsp; Since his head is so hard, he bruised my soft, squishy little scalp.&nbsp; He kissed it.&nbsp; Hee.&nbsp; He left around one.&nbsp; No kisses, but now I'm used to it and I don't expect anything.&nbsp; It's comfortable.&nbsp; We do hug and I like hugs.&nbsp; He sent me a scandalous text once he got home that said, &quot;Now that we've seen each other a couple of times, I'm giving you permission for small kisses but nothing serious yet.&quot;&nbsp; I said, &quot;You're giving ME permission?&nbsp; Trying to preserve your virtue?&quot;&nbsp; I was highly amused.&nbsp; Usually it's the other way around and I was shocked by his presumptuousness.&nbsp; He replied, &quot;I think you're pretty and you're fun to hang out with so I shouldn't stop you if you wanted to kiss me.&nbsp; That's foolish really.&quot;&nbsp; Yes, absolutely silly.&nbsp; I went to bed with a smile on my face.</p><p><strong>Saturday, December 27, 2008</strong>, Carla time!&nbsp; I was looking up movie times for Marley and Me when I got the most peculiar feeling that she was going to cancel on me because she wasn't feeling well.&nbsp; I had no idea why I felt that way.&nbsp; It was completely unfounded, but wouldn't you know it?&nbsp; She didn't cancel on me, but she did say that she didn't feel well enough to be around people in a movie theater.&nbsp; We both thought it was really weird that I had that feeling, but sometimes the sixth sense just creeps up on me.&nbsp; I'm kind of proud of it, actually.&nbsp; It makes me feel like my feelings about things are more significant than they actually are . . . which is why I see signs everywhere.&nbsp; I'm demented.</p><p>Anyway, last night Ray had asked if I wanted to come over and play Rock Band.&nbsp; Um, yes.&nbsp; But he didn't call me soon enough.&nbsp; I told him I might be able to come over later after I left Carla's, but I didn't know how late I would be.&nbsp; I asked him what was the latest he would accept visitors.&nbsp; He said, &quot;Whatever time you get here is as late as I would accept you.&quot;&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Why are you so sweet to me??&nbsp; I headed over to Carla's around six and we exchanged presents when I got there.&nbsp; I was ashamed to give her mine and here's why:</p><p>Carla always makes me the best gifts.&nbsp; One year she made me an apron to cook in, and this year she framed a few photos of us from when we were at the beach.&nbsp; She just put so much thought and effort into it.&nbsp; I bust my brain trying to think of what I could buy her that she would like.&nbsp; It's taken me freaking TWO YEARS to figure out that maybe she would appreciate something I made her more than anything I could buy her.&nbsp; Hell, it might even be easier considering how hard it was for me to buy her something.&nbsp; I nearly cried when I saw the picture frame because it was so sweet and it said so much more than anything she could have found in a store.&nbsp; You know?&nbsp; This is US, it symbolizes our friendship.&nbsp; I felt like a total shit head.&nbsp; My mom knew how badly I felt too.&nbsp; She saw the picture that Carla made and she said, &quot;Yeah, chocolate and wine really doesn't cut it, does it?&quot;&nbsp; No it freaking doesn't.&nbsp; But I'll make it up to her for her birthday now that I actually GET IT.&nbsp; I mean, I bought her wine and chocolate because I know she likes wine and chocolate.&nbsp; The gift wasn't thoughtless, but I can't say it was thoughtful.&nbsp; I will think better next time.</p><p>We decided to go to Macaroni Grill for dinner.&nbsp; It's quickly becoming my favorite Italian spot because I'm allowed to govern what kind of pasta I get.&nbsp; All these other places want to destroy my freedom of choice by making everything all fancy and covered in cream sauces.&nbsp; I can't eat your cream sauces without suffering intense pain and suffering!!!&nbsp; I just want noodles, red sauce, and some shrimps if you got 'em.&nbsp; MacGrill . . . I love you.&nbsp; I devoured that shit!!</p><p>After dinner, we went back to Carla's and watched another one of my great presents, &quot;Walk the Line&quot;.&nbsp; It gets better each and every time I see it, and I pity Vivian less and less.&nbsp; Granted, she had a hard life, but she was a right pill.&nbsp; Carla's mom came in every so often to tell Carla what medicines to take to help her sleep.&nbsp; It was really quite comical.&nbsp; She kept changing her mind.&nbsp; I thought, &quot;You know, a shot of Nyquil will solve the sleeplessness,&quot; but I figured I would keep my thoughts to myself since watching her mom come back and forth with new remedies made me laugh.</p><p>My stomach had been noisy all evening.&nbsp; It wasn't paining me, but it definitely was ominous.&nbsp; Carla could hear it and she kept asking me if I was okay.&nbsp; I said, &quot;I just don't know.&quot;&nbsp; I left around 11:45 and I decided seeing Ray might not be a good idea.&nbsp; I actually got to his street before I turned around.&nbsp; My nerves had pushed my stomach over the edge and it was just going to get ugly.&nbsp; I got home around 12:30.&nbsp; I brushed my teeth and pulled myself together.&nbsp; Then I went back out.&nbsp; Highly unorthodox. I wonder if I woke my parents and I wonder what they thought of it.&nbsp; I don't think it would be appreciated, for sure.&nbsp; I got to Ray's and he was up waiting for me.&nbsp; I didn't get the grand tour, but I will tell you that HUMUNGOUS flat screen TVs occupy three of the THREE rooms I did see.&nbsp; Good God.&nbsp; The TV downstairs (if you can CALL it a TV because it's really a movie screen) needs a projector and it's bigger than my fucking bed.&nbsp; It's sweet, don't get me wrong, but absolutely ridiculous.&nbsp; I feel like I could sit a mile away from it and still see Spongebob's pores.&nbsp; Then we went upstairs into the family room.&nbsp; The TV there was not as big, but big enough.&nbsp; There was also a TV in the kitchen, which Ray's friend Katrina likes to call their spare.&nbsp; In case the upstairs TV falls down or breaks or whatever it is that TVs do to destroy themselves.&nbsp; The house is nothing but televisions.&nbsp; Other than that, the hardwood flooring is spectacular.&nbsp;</p><p>We watched a little bit of everything, but we eventually settled on &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;.&nbsp; It was weird and I really didn't like the way Javier Bardem went around killing people.&nbsp; It was violence of the most grotesque variety and we know how I feel about that.&nbsp; I couldn't get into it.&nbsp; Ray said something about the dialogue being amazing and that's what actually makes the movie good.&nbsp; Yeah, whatever, I couldn't get over all of the killin's.&nbsp; We did some cuddlin' on the couch.&nbsp; There were bits of hand holding involved.&nbsp; He tried to kiss me at one point, but I turned my head so he kissed my cheek.&nbsp; I didn't do it on purpose!&nbsp; He didn't give me any cues, or anything.&nbsp; We were talking about something stupid and I guess I looked at him a second too long.&nbsp; It's not like we were staring deep into each other's eyes and that was the jumping off point.&nbsp; It was an accident, so I don't feel retarded about it.&nbsp; By the time the movie was over, it was around 3:30.&nbsp; I told him that he had to kick me out or else I wouldn't have the resolve to leave.&nbsp; He said, &quot;I'll never kick you out&quot;.&nbsp; I'm thinking, &quot;You don't have to say, 'Ali, get the hell out'!&nbsp; Just say you want to hit the hay!&nbsp; Sheesh!&quot;&nbsp; As it was, I managed to kick myself out.&nbsp; He walked me to the door and we kissed goodnight.&nbsp; It was very normal and seemed common place.&nbsp; As I walked out, he said that he liked to take things slow.&nbsp; I said that I did too.&nbsp; Heck, if we could just stay at the kissing and cuddling stage for the rest of our relationship, I wouldn't have to be so worried about things with Ryan!</p><p>When I got home, my dad was downstairs watching television.&nbsp; He was lying down, but he sat up and said, &quot;Alison!&quot;&nbsp; In the tone of voice he usually uses when the following phrase is, &quot;What the hell are you doing, you idiot?&quot;&nbsp; But he didn't say anything.&nbsp; He said that he had indigestion.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; I went up to bed and passed out.</p><p><strong>Sunday, December 28, 2008</strong>, I cleaned my room most of the day.&nbsp; We're still trying to get all of the junk and crap out of here.&nbsp; My mom had me go through my closet AGAIN to get rid of clothes that I didn't want.&nbsp; Well, I certainly could not give away any more clothes, so I just packed what I knew I wasn't going to wear in the immediate future.&nbsp; It looks much better.&nbsp; My room is mostly together.&nbsp; I have a few extraneous things that really can't be packed into a box or organized into some cubby hole somewhere.&nbsp; I need the books and DS on my night stand.&nbsp; I cannot be parted with those things.&nbsp; In fact, I allowed Sam to take &quot;New Moon&quot; back with her to California and it makes me uneasy.&nbsp; I know I'll get it back and if I don't I can always buy another one, but . . . my Twilight books . . . they're what make me so insane.&nbsp; I know it.</p><p>Ray invited me over to watch the game with him and some people.&nbsp; I went over around 4:30.&nbsp; I met his friend Sean and his roommate Matt.&nbsp; They're all adorable.&nbsp; Sean's girlfriend is Katrina, which made me sad, but she's so nice so I couldn't really fault her too much.&nbsp; I sat on the couch with Ray.&nbsp; I find myself liking him more and more the more we hang out.&nbsp; I know that's typically what's SUPPOSED to happen, but usually I'm attracted to someone immediately.&nbsp; Ray has needed to grow on me.&nbsp; I know it's all complicated by my feelings for Ryan, but when I'm with Ray, Ryan slips my mind until I force him to the forefront.&nbsp; I don't quite know why I do that.&nbsp; It's like I'm determined to sabotage myself.&nbsp; But I found myself watching Ray a lot yesterday.&nbsp; I would watch him walk, I would watch him interact with his friends, I would watch his expressions, and it was like an engine revved inside me.&nbsp; Or something equally cheesy.&nbsp; I let a little bit of my reservations go and I noticed how cute he was, how his smile is infectious, how big and green his eyes are, how the boy has a booty . . . all of that happy slappy crap.</p><p>Now it's like I can't wait to see him.&nbsp; I feel happy.&nbsp; I feel that excitement that comes with new relationships.&nbsp; I'm still worried, but I find that it's easier for me to let my guard down.&nbsp; And the fact that he wants to take things slow (for reasons that I don't know . . . or maybe he's just a gentleman.&nbsp; God, two in a row, could I really be so lucky?) makes him all the more attractive.</p><p>We migrated downstairs for some reason after the game was over.&nbsp; To the movie screen (completely superfluous) and watched Animation Domination.&nbsp; Sean and Katrina had left, but Matt came down with us.&nbsp; He went upstairs to get something, so Ray took the opportunity to kiss me.&nbsp; He was holding a beer in his left hand, and I guess he forgot his was holding it.&nbsp; I went back to kiss him again, but this time HE turned his head and realized that he spilt his beer all over his computer and the leather ottoman.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Here is the text conversation that ensued once I got home (I can't remember everything that I said, so I'm improvising):</p><p>&quot;Is that the first time you've ever had a guy kiss you and throw his beer on his laptop because he was so excited?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes it is.&nbsp; And I was very upset because I wasn't done kissing you.&nbsp; I wanted more kisses!&quot;<br />&quot;Well let's see, I went from feeling like I was flying, to a light panic, followed by pure embarrassment.&nbsp; I want to kiss you now, later, and all the other times time has.&quot;</p><p>I have cavities.</p><p><strong>Monday, December 29, 2008</strong>, I got a call from Shelbie today (from Delta T).&nbsp; She wanted to see if I would be available for a phone interview around 1 PM.&nbsp; Yes, of course . . . WHY DON'T I HAVE THIS JOB YET?!?!&nbsp; I prepared a little bit by writing down some notes.&nbsp; I knew they would come in handy.&nbsp; I just wanted to have all of my thoughts together so I wasn't all higgledy piggledy groping for words.&nbsp; Turns out I didn't really need it.&nbsp; A woman named Michele called me and she seemed relatively impressed with what I had to say.&nbsp; When I recounted what I said back to my mom, she kept saying, &quot;Ah!&quot;&nbsp; Like she couldn't believe how clever I was.&nbsp; I thought she was just saying it because I'm her daughter and I could never say anything wrong, but she said the words I used were big and impressive.&nbsp; Since she mentioned it, I recalled a few of Michele's responses once I was done speaking and she did sound a bit impressed.&nbsp; I think the most important question she asked me was what I thought of the Columbia office.&nbsp; I said nothing but glowing things about Ben and Ryan, because they were really nice guys.&nbsp; I said how they seemed really approachable and friendly, and like I could go to them with any questions, and I would like to have them as bosses.&nbsp; Then I said something about the intimacy of the office.&nbsp; My mom said &quot;approachable&quot; and &quot;intimacy&quot; were great words.&nbsp; I don't think of them as &quot;big&quot;, but I guess she doesn't hear them often in interviews?&nbsp; Granted, my mom isn't a hiring manager and she doesn't have remotely anything to do with HR, but I like to think I know the right things to say . . . and I was actually being honest.&nbsp; I would like to work there.&nbsp; I'd be responsible for shit.&nbsp; She said that they were interviewing three other people besides myself and that I was the last person that she spoke with (and CJ, my recruiter, said that that was a good thing since I would be fresh in her mind).&nbsp; She said they want to make a decision by the end of the week, so I will know by the end of this week or next week.</p><p>Then I got a call from a girl named Jennifer (again, Delta T) asking me about McDaniel.&nbsp; She said that she was checking my references and she was trying to verify my education, but she kept getting a busy signal from McD.&nbsp; She asked if I could send her a copy of my degree.&nbsp; Now, AAI did all of that stuff once I was hired.&nbsp; I don't know if Delta T does things differently, but why would they go through the trouble of a background check if they didn't intend to make me an offer?&nbsp; Hopefully.&nbsp; The money won't be great, but it's an HR job, I'll have healthcare by March, and they'll pay my tuition after a year, which is kind of lame, but I'll take what I can get.</p><p>Ray asked me what I'm doing for New Year's.&nbsp; Yes!!!&nbsp; I'll have to talk to Carla.&nbsp; I had already planned on splitting my evening between her and Fells Point, but she mentioned something about wanting to come with me.&nbsp; I want to go out shopping and get a dress.&nbsp; I'll have to do that tomorrow, obviously.&nbsp; I feel like silver would be the way to go, but I don't know how that would play off my hair and skin.&nbsp; I'd look like a veela.&nbsp; I wish I'd look like a veela.&nbsp; Hmm, or I could just wear my prom dress from senior year and invest in a cardigan.&nbsp; I feel like that would be much cheaper.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; I'd love to wear something pretty for Ray.&nbsp; Well, and for the rest of the world because I'm an attention whore LE DUH!!!</p><p>Oh my God, can you believe it's the end?!</p><p>END!!!</p><p>~Ali</p>"

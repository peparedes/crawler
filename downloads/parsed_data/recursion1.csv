next i will have to finish my webpage
my 2d teacher really liked my project i think i was the only one who didnt half ass it which proves that i dont have a life. my classmates also really liked it too and they played with it even after crit was over i will post pictures whehn i have decided that it is finished i would like to do drugs but there are none readily avaliable. lots of my fellow floormates are depressed here too and hate it i am slowly finding out."

i dont understand why im so resistant to sleep i havent passed out yet
i took xanax which usually puts me out right away it just made me feel bad or i feel bad naturally and it has no effect im depressed her because i feel defensless and trap[ed and i have no geniune desire to be here or do the work that im supposed to be doing here. the people im forced to communicate with on a day to day basis is very forced. living in these dorms is like being at a really terrible party that you cant escape from all these social interactions are forced and im tired of having to be fake and pretend like everyone here isnt a fucking moron.
my body hurts and i have no appetite and i cant sleep
im looking foward to the end of school but im weary that nothing too much better lies ahead"

oh where to start. . .alright well me erica,caitlyn,ali,tonya,nikki,angela,matt,andrew,and bill alll went to zach's after the dance wow crazy we got so hammered i had no idea what was going on some dude kept giving me jager bombs and some joe guy closed the door on my fingers so i made him kiss them to make them feel better. we played beer pong. danced. drank some more. john tried jumping over a chair got his foot caught on the top of it and smacked into the cement floor! that was a good moment...aww tom kept checking on me to see if i was ok cause i thought i was gunna pass out! so yeah i finally fell asleep on zachs couch and all of a sudden matt comes screaming at me jessica jessica wake your ass up the f'in cops are coming and im so trashed idk whats going on but i get up we're all running outside i forget my shoes and im running down a dirt road barefoot. it hurt badly so matt was gunna pick me up cause i started walking but i told him not too so hes blown the fuck up and starts driving my moms car home to my house there is not a single sober person in the car it was crazy but he did good clearly we didnt die! so we all just past out around my house. then the next morning we got up and went to Kens country kitchen. hah then me tonya and bill went back to zachs house to find tonyas purse and get my shoes they left and i stayed and partied with everyone cause they never really stopped drinking poor BJ we think he had alcohol poisoning cause like every 10 minutes he got up and puked.omg Clay and zach were FUBAR(fucked up beyond all recognition) and they decided to take zachs motor-scooter to get us all pizza and clay fell off the back of it and cut open his nose and forhead!!! it was soo fucking funny i have never laughed soo hard in my life then charity was talking to hot carl about why he talks shit about her cunt ass behind her back and hes like i dont wanna talk about it right now and she started yelling at him then she went after him and started swinging at him it was the funniest thing ever shes such a stupid bitch!! i think thatsss all that happend prolly a lot more but i was too messed up to remember so yeah all i can say is that it was utterly belligerent! now im completely exhausted so peace!"

"event","I hope you never lose your sense of wonder 
You get your fill to eat 
But always keep that hunger 
May you never take one single breath for granted 
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed 
I hope you still feel small 
When you stand beside the ocean 
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens 
Promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance 

And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 
I hope you dance 
I hope you dance 

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance 
Never settle for the path of least resistance 
Living might mean taking chances 
But they're worth taking 
Lovin' might be a mistake 
But it's worth making 
Don't let some hell bent heart 
Leave you bitter 
When you come close to selling out 
Reconsider 
Give the heavens above 
More than just a passing glance 

And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 
I hope you dance 
(Time is a real and constant motion always) 
I hope you dance 
(Rolling us along) 
I hope you dance 
(Tell me who) 
I hope you dance 
(Wants to look back on their youth and wonder) 
(Where those years have gone) 

I hope you still feel small 
When you stand beside the ocean 
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens 
Promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance 

And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 
Dance 
I hope you dance 
I hope you dance"

"event","Crashed on the floor when I moved in 
This little bunk alone with some strange new friends
Stay up too late, and I'm too thin 
We promise each other it's til the end 
Now we're spinning empty bottles 
It's the five of us 
With pretty eyed boys girls die to trust
I can't resist the day 
No, I can't resist the day 

Jenny screams out and it's no pose
'Cause when she dances she goes and goes
Beer through the nose on an inside joke 
I'm so excited, I haven't spoken 
And she's so pretty, and she's so sure
Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her
The summer's all in bloom 
The summer is ending soon 

It's alright and it's nice not to be so alone
But I hold on to your secrets in white houses 

Maybe I'm a little bit over my head
I come undone at the things he said 
And he's so funny in his bright red shirt
We were all in love and we all got hurt 
I sneak into his car's black leather seat 
The smell of gasoline in the summer heat 
Boy, we're going way too fast 
It's all too sweet to last 

It's alright
And I put myself in his hands
But I hold on to your secrets in white houses
Love, or something ignites in my veins 
And I pray it never fades in white houses 

My first time, hard to explain
Rush of blood, oh, and a little bit of pain
On a cloudy day, it's more common than you think
He's my first mistake 

Maybe you were all faster than me
We gave each other up so easily 
These silly little wounds will never mend
I feel so far from where I've been 
So I go, and I will not be back here again
I'm gone as the day is fading on white houses 
I lie, put my injuries all in the dust 
In my heart is the five of us 
In white houses 

And you, maybe you'll remember me
What I gave is yours to keep 
In white houses 
In white houses 
In white houses"

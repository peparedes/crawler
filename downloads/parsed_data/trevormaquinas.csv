"event","So a young man travels to find The Law.  He comes to a gate and is met by a gatekeeper blocking his path.  He tells the gatekeeper that he is journeying to find The Law and asks for permission to pass.  The gatekeeper refuses him.  The man asks what will happen if he ignores him and continues on his journey to which the gatekeeper informs him that this is but the first gate and that the gatekeepers get progressively more fearsome.  ""Even I cannot gaze upon but the third gatekeeper,"" he says.  And with that he stands to the side.  The man ponders this and then takes a seat beside him.  Years pass and the man continues to ask/bribe/and beg the gatekeeper to grant him permission to find The Law and while the gatekeeper listens to his begging and accepts his bribes, he remains steadfast in his refusal to grant him that permission.  Finally after decades and decades the young man becomes an aged, decrepit old man.  And as he is about to die, a thought occurs to him.  He motions to the gatekeeper.  The gatekeeper leans in close so he can he the old man's question.  ""Every man is on a quest to find the law.  So why is it that in all these many years I have not seen a single man past by you on that quest?""  The gatekeeper replies, ""Because this gate was built especially for you.""  He then closes the gate and the old man dies.

What I think Kafka means with that parable is that in everyman's journey, there is an obstacle built especially for him and that if he is to complete that journey he must ignore the warnings of danger and continue and risk failure or he will merely resign himself to the same fate.  Pretty cool, huh?"

"event","So I've been looking at apartments with Liza.  There's a couple that we've decided to apply for, both in St. Paul.  I don't know if we'll get one, nor do I know what I will do if we get one.  My job at the Marsh will be ending in a couple weeks thanks to my dad forcing me to hand in my 2 weeks notice after he paid to fix my car.  I was supposed to be driving out to CA after New Year, but both my mother and I think it's stupid for me to be attempting the drive over the Rockies and Sierras this time of year.  My father maintains that it would be a brilliant idea despite his never having driven over them in Winter.  This disagreement has led to another level of tension in the Allen/Colwell household.  Susan thinks it would be best for everyone if I found another place to stay until I get an apartment.  So I'm not getting kicked out this time so much as being asked to leave.  She also said she was thinking about leaving my father because of ""his shit.""  So it's starting to seem like dark times might be ahead and I don't know if I'm still going to family Christmas at my grandma's or if my dad'll metaphorically kill me if I go.  So I don't know.  I'm apathetic in my ambivalence over this whole thing and my ultimate decision seems to be leaning more and more towards fuck-my-father.  I guess this might be the burgeoning of Adult Kyle.  Scary.

In Other News:

I've renewed my love of alcohol and have spent the past couple weekends just getting trashed.  This in the place of smoking pot, since I might have to be taking some job-related drug tests in the coming weeks.  It's weird, but I don't really miss pot that much.  I still have about a dime in my car and I've thought about smoking it but always end up finding anything else to do.  Once again, weird.  Only real complaint is that alcohol's more expensive.

Lastly, I'm becoming more and more a skinhead."

"event","So here's why Nate can choke on a sea crab and die for all I care.  The other day his car broke down and now needs its transmission replaced.  The source of the problem, he claims, is your humble narrator.  He says that since I don't always downshift around corners, that's why the transmission broke.  Now, it is true that I don't always do that.  It's something I never really have to do in my car and so only when it occurs to me do I do it.  Now there are several reasons why his car troubles are not my fault.  

1. He's mentioned the need to do it in his car to me once.  While riding in my car he made an offhanded comment about it.  He claims he's told me while I've driven his car too, but based on the same logic he used in his severing with Sam Lambert, if you can't think of an instance then one doesn't exist, he's never told me.

2. Everytime I've driven his car he's been in it.  If I do something wrong it's his responsibility to tell me and make sure I don't do it again.  If I keep doing it then he should not allow me to drive his car.  Which brings me to...

3. I've never asked to drive his car (one time aside).  Everytime it's because he asks me to and then when I say I'd rather not he makes a tissy until I do.  Personally, unless the owner is impaired, they should be the one doing the driving because they are the most familiar with the needs of the car.  When they ask someone else to drive, they are knowingly taking a risk and it is, once again, their responsibility to make the needs of the car known through out the time they are in the passenger seat, and to keep badgering whoever's driving until they drive the car correctly.

4. The reason behind it is, according to my father and uncle, who grew up the sons of a mechanic and, my uncle especially, have worked on cars pretty much their entire lives, bullshit.  The fact that his idle's been off for so long without any attention given to it was a warning sign (ironically, I had mentioned this to him in the past and he scoffed it off) that the car was getting old and things were starting to go wrong mechanically with it.  And since I'd only stalled it once or twice (if that) going around corners, the car's age and Nate's job were far more likely to have been the culprit than anything I might've done.

5. I rarely drive his car.  I can pretty much count the times on one hand.  The last time was at least a week and a half ago and it's just broken down in the past day or two.  After I had driven it, it continued to run as well as it ever had with no warning signs whatsoever.

Nate, if you read this, you are a bitch.  And please do me a favour and if you feel the need to purge your soul of the situation, please call your friends and not mine, especially my fucking sister.  It's just in poor taste and is much much worse than anything, real or imagined, that Sam may have done to you.  For you are scum and this has been the last straw.

Your shit is waiting in my garage, pick it up soon, but please call beforehand.  And I want all of my cds back and the Strawberry Zots tape in your car.  Consider yourself severed."

"event","A bit of an interesting dilemma.  We've both admitted to having thoughts about both of them.  The only difference is the order.  I guess we could stick to that order, but then we'd both sort of be racked with nosogood feelings.  I almost wish that neither of us had told the other but just let things happen.  So much healthier that way."

"event","PARIS IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS!

Well rather plane to Detroit followed by three hours of waiting followed by plane to Amsterdam followed by 20 minutes of running to the plane to Paris...

I'm so pissed about the lack of time to do anything in Amsterdam (AMSTERDAM!  MY MECCA!) and the abundance of time to do jackshit in Detroit.  Oh well.

Guess I'll just start wasting away now.  Nothing to do until tomorrow evening.  Pouvre Kyle, as Vanessa used to say.  I think it either meant unbelievably delicious Kyle or poor Kyle.

Syntax is important in comedy.

I'm kinda random right now.

I've been really thirsty all day...

I have to poop.

Only Sam will read this.

Damn you all.

Bubble Tape isn't nearly as delicious as I remembered and Shamrock Shakes aren't nearly as vile as I remembered.

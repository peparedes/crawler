"event","I'm going to try and start posting more crap here since my pal Zero no longer lives near me and won't be in on my shitty life as much.~

I went outside myself this week and visited some friends in Pittsburgh, PA.  Not really sure how I ended up there, just a long, strange sequence of events leading up to it.  Something I needed though, my mind has come to get the better of me in these recent months, slowly leading me down a path of depression and self-hatred.  GAWD, I sound so emo! -_-;;  This trip just may help me get ""unstuck"".  Who knows, I may end up moving there and starting a new life.  All I know is I need to get out of here. 

It was a fun trip, hung with people I've known for 2 years but never met before (yes, I met them online >.>)  Though most of the time we were intoxicated in some form or another, I enjoyed the company of new people.  I've never had many guy friends so being around 3 guys all day for 4 days was awkward and somewhat arousing ~.^  The one part that sucked was that I get nervous around new people and situations.  So, to be around no one I knew in a place I've never been was totally terrifying!  Oh well, I still had a blast!

After any enjoyable experience, there is always the let down that follows.  I didn't want to leave, though my bed was calling my name (sleeping on the floor at my age should be unlawful), and the responsibilities of employment loomed over my head.  So, here I sit in my apartment, soaking in the bitter-sweet afterthoughts of this new experience.

p.s.- No, Zero, nothing happened between me and you-know-who... ;__;"

"event","I found out that Media Play (the place where I buy all my anime, games and movies) is closing ;_____;  Good news is that everything is 20% off!! lol  I went in there yesterday to do Xmas shopping and ended up buying more stuff for myself lol.  How could I resist anime that has a ""20% Off"" sticker on it??!!  It's just not possible!!  I bought Cromartie High School...I had read an article about it and my pal Zero told me it was really funny, so I grabbed that...and I'm glad I did! lol  It's a nice compliment to Azumanga Daioh which is all high school girls lol  I also picked up Drawn Together...uncensored!  OMG is all I can say lol"

"event","Today I saw two movies; Chronicles of Narnia and Final Fantasy: Advent Children.

As a child, my favorite series of books was The Chronicles of Narnia.  It was rather exciting to see this story put on the big screen.  The movie actually followed the book fairly well, except they added a scene that wasn't even in the book, but oh well lol.  I don't remember the Witch being a ninja and weilding two swords, but it was pretty cool watching her depicted this way.  

Final Fantasy, of course, my favorite RPG series!  Advent Children takes place two years following the events in Final Fantasy VII.  VII was the first game in the series I played, thanks to my pal Zero ~.^  The graphics in the movie are amazing, in my opinion, and Tifa kicks some major ass! lol  It was nice to finally see it...and HEAR some voices lol!"

Anyhoo, enough of that crap.  I'll just stick to playing Magna Carta and Tactics.  Zero just let me borrow Tactics because she's cool like that.

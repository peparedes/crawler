"event","(Aladdin)I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

(Jasmine)A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
that now I'm in a whole new world with you

(Aladdin)Now I'm in a whole new world with you

(Jasmine)Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

(Jasmine)A whole new world
(Aladdin)Don't you dare close your eyes
(Jasmine)A hundred thousand things to see
(Aladdin)Hold your breath - it gets better
(Jasmine)I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
(Aladdin)A whole new world
(Jasmine)Every turn a surprise
(Aladdin)With new horizons to pursue
(Jasmine)Every moment gets better
(Both)I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

(Aladdin)A whole new world
(Jasmine)A whole new world
(Aladdin)That's where we'll be
(Jasmine)That's where we'll be
(Aladdin)A thrilling chase
(Jasmine)A wondrous place
(Both)For you and me"

"event","sooo yea this weekend basically sucked. i was planning on actually being with jose but nope. We won our game friday 16-1 er sumthin like that, but anywho i was guna be w/ jose because we always chill on fridays but no he had work from 8:30-12, but be4 that i was gettin pissed because hes forever telling me he'll call back and i hate when he's like yea i'll call you back, when in reality he won't. so then it made me believe that he wasn't even interested in me anymore and i wasnt guna waist my time on this kid. After i drove home from my game with mariss ree n sam, i called him and asked him what he wuz guna do, but he said he had work and then said ""il call u back"" soo knowing me, i knew he wasnt guna. I get to marissa's and just lay down, i feel liek shit and just wish he'd be honest with em fo a least a second. THen bianca calls me and im tellin her the drama, and mariss says oo its jose, lol and im like na it aint oh boy is at work.. i guess it was him he didn't go in till l8er and i asked him all this ?'s and he said he likes me still and wuz callin me baby. Then i get all cheesy.. slyvia n alicia come over we just walk round' the hood see binks n mike talk to them fo a bit and just chill. Come home i fall asleep. Saterday double header at curie, was a bad ass game, horrible we played bad wel we werent that bad but we should've been workin harder and my arm should've been faster. COme home talk to jose plannin on seein him but he goes with his friend i go to sleep.. calls me wants ta come over w/ his bois. He does, augh he was lookin fresh =) i was gettin a little uhuh!! haha j/k but then i hada lock up my store, he wanted me to go to hiz-house it was already 10:30 i said no.. he said he'd call me back, he didnt until 1:03 am thats the time he always calls and then... we talked.. got off by 1*45 and iuno.. we made plans fo friday but iuno if thats guna even happen, who knos. im just sick n tired of his drama.. i seen this quote n made me think.

so many times i've thought of jus ending this...jus givin up and walkin away..then you call--i hear your voice, and i forget what i wanted to say. when things are good, i feel so guilty for ever wanting to leave...but soon they go bad and i cry myself to sleep. i dont know how i let myself get so mad, but the one i gave my heart to isn't supposed to make

    today ima go do laundry at my store then who knos, i have a youth mass tonight and meeting, maybe he'll call me after. i Hope so, i miss him so much and fallin fo him nasty"

My heart still aches from the sorrow and the pain
Time has come for me to say goodbye
Although the precious times will never leave my mind

Your love was so ease at sea
Oh boy, I gave you all my time

"event","well ever since i wrote in here things went down hill fo real, im so sick of bullshit and people who think that they kno ppl but they really dont. The dance was funn i uno if i wrote about that, i talked to jose most of the time, hes soo cute=) but see the thing i really dont get is, we could be havin the best conversation right and oh boy goes: ill call u l8er. Which by the way, 50% of the time he doesnt. O well right, i try not to care but im fallin hard fo this kid and i shouldn't. I have no idea how he feels, he's horny half the time. Haha j/k but i am? sometimes he is but basically we just kiss and when i kiss him things seem so right, he makes me feel good. I really really like this kid fo real. Me n joel have been talkin a lot but he thinks i like him man, oh boy is str8 up loving and i hate it cuz i dont like him like that anymore. The feeling sorta just went away and im sorry that u think i like u like that. I care about u still yes, but the feelings of love went away. 

    I really hope i see jose this weekend, i miss him so much. Seeing him once a week isnt helping me. He works so much so i sorta don't caer as much that he doesn't call me back. 

  I cry because i think of all the right things you said to me and all of the wrong things you've done to me: joey-- read that. 

  Man i dont think you know how hard it is to talk to you as a friend, i really realy like jose a lot and i mean comon' i duno why im falling so hard, but hes got the cutest face and bigg lips and really nice face and he gets me hypnotized when i talk to him! He is always on my mind i really really like him and the way he is. I have a game at curie saterday hopefully he goes and all  my girls are going, im very very excited! I hope they all go =) im supposda get blown n fucked up saterday, i need it stressin out badly

   I wish i could change things, but i cant and i regret a lot of stuff.
  To all my main girls: Ree Jack Christina Ritz Riss VeroM Nicole Shaq n Sam thanks girls u guys help me all tha time n help me realize a lot. Love u guys so much.

Well friday_sucked cuz me n erin got inta a fight right after me n joel got over one, then it just was horrible but i went out n chilled w/ my girls i guess was aite?? saterday_woke up cleaned then headed to work, for a couple hours... softball at 12, i seriously HATE varsity. Ms Price always picks on me and makes me do a ton of shit that i cant stand carly this carly that.. just b/c im a sophomore on varisty doesnt make me a freshman worker. I hate it and its like i dont have fun and in softball we're supposda? i work extremely hard and as of right now, i dont like it. But then me n my dad went shopping w/ elliot n da babyy =) oo soo cute.. and i came home went out with riss and patty, i seriously have the best time when im with them we went to portillos, mrs gora may i add by the way? hailerous(spellled wrong possibly) then we went ot see constentine, didnt really understand the movie but it was good.

Hey! well today is Sunday and  i have another journal at greatestjournal.com/babiichicka11. Maria decorated it i think it looks soo perrty thanks babe =) Now i have to journals, i will probably only be writing in one thou!!
My weekend has been actually fun! Friday i came home from school and hurried got ready n went skiing with my Youth Group it was an over night thing, but we skied from 12am-4:30am it was so much fun =) Me n Riss were teachin everyone lol, by the way riss your awsome!! I had so much fun! We left Galena at like 5am(Saterday) and got home by 8:30 so i came home fell asleep till 12 then went to work at 1:00! Maria came up by like 3 and she got me cheese fries for my fat self n then walked to Walgreens and got me a camera!! At like 6 joel and alex came up to my store, augh i stil had costumers it was nuts! They both were so hyper n joel was like puking? They left to go smoke, came back.. got maria from christians n alex wanted to get w. maria,but i dont think she liked um' WE ate at La Valentina, alex n joey were like passed out so me n maria were sorta bored.
Then we went ta joeys for a little alex got picked up n den we went back to my house!!
Fight broke out: We watched the Notebook and joey was fallin asleep on me but i didnt want him to cuz he was all laying all over on me i was like get uP! We just started screaming at each other, and it led into giving back my valentines day present n him slaming my door. I didn't want to talk to him that night.SUnday me my ma aunt n cuz went downtown to see ""Circle of Friends"" by American Girl DOlls it was soo good and some parts were sad, i bought coconut the dog its a stuffed animal! WE went to Rainforest Cafe for lunch and i bought me and my cuz a monkey n we took sticker pictures, let me kno if ya want one hehe... it was so much fun! Then went to mass and read n prayed obviously. 
SO it's Lent, i gave up chocalte-spelled wrong) n im trying to watch what i eat, and i wanna pray more b/c i got somethin really important/serious that i need prayers for, and rather not mention.. it's on my mind. I also want to be a better friend and tell them how i feel more. I hate the fact if it bothers me, i make a big deal about it. My friends are like my sisters and mean so much to me. I care so much about them and care what they do and say. IM not over-protective of them, just that i love um' so much. I wanna change my ways and be a better person over all. 
I miss Arizona and my cuzins o so much =( i cant wait till i see them over the summer it'll be fun in Mexico a week after my 16th birfday!! Also, i have a feeling im going to dump Joey, not sure when... not tomorrow, but maybe... this week. Things arent good at all and im really tired of fighting with him! He's my love but, i think it's time.. what do i do? helppp! leave me comments...

I have so much when im with my cuzins but when we leave each other, its kind've hard. But the last day there Monday night wuz fun i met Ashley (lol) well i didnt meet her.. i havent seen her in a while n Brogan was kind've upsessed with me and everyone thought i was funny but im not (lol) well technically i am just a little, im naturally funny! Newho, school started today, i was hoping for a snow day, yea right i was just kidding myself!! School's going alright.. im just soo tired and i havent been my happy self.. i guess its cuz i gotta keep mine n joel's relationship on the d/l cuz of the parentals and i really really am depressed that i cant be in Arizona )= i kind've wanna live there but then again i dont. I just can't wait till the end of school in June when our whole ""Wallis"" family goes out there n goes to Mexico, its guna b tha shitt!! (lol) Me n joel are doin alright, he got into a horrible car accident n was lucky he survived )= he had to wear a neck brace and hes got scars all over his back n elbows! The car flipped 4 times, wow am i lucky i still got him!!! god bless him, i lub him so much.. he keeps my head high for me. For the Bianca deal, i aint even guna make a big deal about that and plus its somethin so little that i dont need to make such a big deal about, theres more other things i could be worried about n stress out about. My break was awsum thou and tomorrow i either might go to the movies or rita game, iuno yet thou. Saterday riss invited me to go skiing but iuno if i'll go. I leave for Washington the 21st till the 24th.... i havent been eatin either fo some reason but w/e i guess i really miss Arizona, but what can you do. Im gettin the pictures back today and i hope i dont start ta cry lol) iuno Chicago for me, isn't the same.Being with my cuzins.. makes me 4get all the drama n all we do is laugh.. they are like my sisters.

Friday_ i believe i went out with Joey n we hung out walked around n went to a party. Saterday_ did nothing but worked n Joel went out with his familia so i called Paulina n asked her to come over and she did. We walked to Patty's and this kid Gabriel wanted to talk to her so they talked n she really liked him( seemed as if she did). I told her to talk to him for a while so she did. riss came over and we just talked.. Sunday_Teen mass n then talked with Paulina, joel came over and fights!! The week was going alright, me n joel were doin badd :\ but newho... i really dont wanna go into detail what i did durin the week but al i kno is my friendship ended with Paulina because I ditched her on Friday, when i had a reason because she lied to me about liking Gabriel and told Marissa she hated him... yea and its not the fact its over Gabriel, its that she LIED about a GUY and if she cant even be honest with me bout a damn guy what makes me think she can be honest with me about nethin. So she thought itd be best if she werent friends, i called her like 5-10 times Tuesday, but she didnt answer so i gave up. Yesterday Wednesday Maria came over n we went to the park.. then just went back to Joels. Im soo confuzed on whats going on in life seriously. =( i got so much shit on my mind right now and iuno what to do. Im supposda either go to take pictures with Bianca or sleepover maria's but i think ima go to maria's. Paulina if u read this im sorry and hope ya had a good turkey day... i kinda miss the fact she didnt answer my calls and miss tha feelin of talkin to her n callin her twin but o we'll i dont want to kiss neone's ass nemore. I got more shit on my mind about someone and i kno its guna ruin a lot of stuff between me n someone but, i really really have feelings really bad for this person... iuno i need advice

Take a nap its about 5 so i get up get ready for work!I got my report card and i did alright, 3 b's..1 c.. and 1 fruckin D in geometry but i dunt care cuz our teacher is a re-tar-do! neways off that subject.. about Thursday! THIS IS WHERE IT ALL BEGINS! Bianca had called me about 4 good times and needed to tell me something. So i said alright, whats up? she said that mike needed to talk to me. Mike gets on the phone and tells me joel wanted to get some girl's number this past week. After i heard that i wanted to die! Because this isn't the 1st or 2nd time, its the 3rd. So i hung up the phone and started to fight with Joel. We kinda resovled everything. Then Friday i didnt go to skewl cuz i was sick =') yea, so i stayed home n joel came over after his half day n watched movies with me. Then i wanted him to leave so he did and Maria n Riss came over. We played clue and watched the Lizzy moViE! RIss wanted to go home so we walked her home augh n this is where everything happend again. I called Joel so i could go gget SHerek 2 to watch. While we were there, maria n joel were talking and bianca called to say she was coming for me. When they came, they told me to get in the car cuz i dont need joel's bullshit. I kinda thought i shouldnt get in the car, but i did and i felt really bad. That whole night, i couldnt get that off my mind. I was bawling. No one will ever kno how i feel about joel and i hate the feeling that we treat each other like shit. IM so tired of it, well today i have work from 3-6 and i think ima have joel come over n just relax with me, like work everything out! I loveee rEe n binKS! thanks guys 4 everything oh yea n mike!! lol

I'm sorry to hear about how things are going right now. On the one hand, I have to agree with your Mom and Rick or just your Mom, whatever, that it's not really respectful to come home at all different hours of the night. It is her house and her rules. But I do believe that she should have listened to what your reason was. It's not always easy being a parent and she is trying to help you avoid making mistakes. It's a natural response as a parent.

Now......you are having problems because you didn't discuss the ground rules before you decided to move back home. The other reason you are having problems is because you had made a decision to do something and you are regressing a bit. You did decide to stop hurting and make a move for the better but you went back to seeing Heather. The last reason you are having trouble is because you lied. 

You dumbo. You kept lying to yourself that you were happy with your situation with Heather, you kept lying to Heather that nothing was wrong and you lied the other night so that you could see Heather. If you have to lie to go out and do something or lie to protect someone's feelings, then you're going to get shit in the end. And you are getting SHIT now. Stop lying to people and say what's on your mind.

Haven't I taught you anything? Ha ha. I think you need to step back and think about what is most important here. What is most important is YOU! You are older and more mature but you aren't wise to everything that is out there. And that is why your parents are putting restrictions on you. It would be best for you to sit down with your Mom and have a heart to heart discussion about what the ground rules are and what they should be. You are an adult. So act like an adult and negotiate on the rules.

If you can't agree on the rules or if you think it's gonna be worse than better. Set a time frame for when you want to be out. You'll have to respect the wishes of your ""rents"" until that time but at least you won't have to after that. LIFE IS TOUGH! But living life without family is even tougher. Bear through it until now. And you can ask me anything. I would gladly give you a ride home anytime unless I had other plans. So don't be afraid of asking me. 

The three worst things I think you could do right now is have a blow up with your ""rents"", move back in with Heather, and give up. You have to find yourself first. I think you need to shut out everything for a few days and just sort through your immediate situation. You may love Heather and miss Heather but remember how you felt just 1 week ago. You may want to grow up and move out on your own but remember you don't have enough money saved up yet. You may want to go back to school but you are in no condition to do that either. 

You need some freedom and the only way you're going to get that is to get a car. You can go where you want to go and drive yourself to work and feel independent again. But you'll have to respect your parents rules too. After you get a car, then work on finding a place. Then work on making more money and saving for school. Finally, you can work on a relationship. You need to fix yourself first. How can you take care of anything if you can't fix yourself? Huh? Huh? Huh?

I love you and I've been there. This is my advice and just my advice. It would probably work better if you did it this way but it's up to you. Don't fret, I love you.

 I've been down in the dumps for a few days, and also stressed because of writing to two papers.&nbsp; I felt all wired and unable to sleep and everything.
 I put on Smashing Pumpkins - Tonight Tonight and closed my eyes.&nbsp; I felt like I was flying for 4 minutes and 14 seconds.&nbsp; I immediately felt better afterwards.&nbsp; Still a little down but better.&nbsp; The wired feeling went away and I felt ready for sleep. By tomorrow night my paper will be done and the stress will be gone.&nbsp; I get to go see my girlfriend tomorrow and that will be wonderful (and lessen the stress as I write the paper, it will barely feel like work if I'm in that kind of environment.)&nbsp; Its a wonderful life.&nbsp; Music lets me remember."

Alien
Aliens
Altered States
Two giant Epics I had been putting off because there were Giant Epics
Sunshine and Schindler's List (both oddly enough, featuring Ralph Fiennes, and both involving the holocaust and also both having, in ralph fiennes, the best acting ive seen in a long long time, especailly sunshine, oh and sunshine had william hurt much like altered states, funny)
I also listened to a bunch of records later on at night all the way through with my eyes closed on my sofa pretending i was in whatever time period the record came out inand a part of that scene
Velvet Underground - White Light/White Heat (2 times)
The Minutemen- Double NIckel on the Dime
The Minutemen - The Punch Line
The Minutemen - What Makes a Man start Fires?
Bad Brains - Rock for Light
Minor Threat - Out of Step
I also finally listened to the new built to spill, i love it, and i decided to give this john vanderslice guy a chance as id heard such good things
hes pretty damn good, i like the song exodus damage and dear sarah siu and dead slate pacific and the golden gate the most
hm
i read alot of the first discworld novel
i hope to finish it soon as i want to start this Patrick McCabe novel The Dead School
and this summer i'll probably read THe Butcher Boy finally (i cant wait for murakami's new book of short stories due at the end of the year, as well as neil gaiman's)
i did alot of nothing, read alot of magazines
oh I re-read the whole Transmetropolitan series by warren ellis, i wanna be spider jerusalem when i grow up sometimes
and i also just sat around and listened to alot of music and slept

book idea
something of a document of my mid high school to early college life
fiction tho
involving druggy halluicnatory scenes of the times i cut/thought of suicide
embellished
not a memoir
but based on my life
i like the idea that my addiction was never drugs but was also self-destructive
and it felt somewhat like i was in the thrall of drugs in those times
or at least
from the ltitle drug experience i had
so
i like the idea of hallucinatory dreamlike druggy prose at times in literature that involves drugs or things of that nature
so
id put it in the scenes when i handled my ""drug"" or addiction, when i felt in thrall or under the influence of something else
because when i did that, it was euphoric and depressive, hallucinatory, crazy and weird
feeling suicidal is definitely not normal brain patterns as well
something of a document of that turbulent period in my life
take people and romantic type things in my life
maybe make composites of them
i'm going to experiment by writing some experiences with that addiction
some real events
in a hallucinatory way
see what happens
cool"

"event","So, why am I posting for real again?  After all this time?  What am I going to write about?  What am I doing here?  To be honest, I do not know.  For the past two days (yesterday and today...also the title of a beatles album with a very strange cover...but I digress), I've felt this...melancholia I feel from time to time.  It's not exactly depression, but it definitely isn't a stable balanced feeling of emotion.  Why is it happening?  I am not truly sure, I could be feeling down because I'm a bit lonely, all week I was doing stuff with someone until I fell asleep, but last night I was alone and today all day I have been with my family, whom I love, but I feel slightly like I am alone, or, maybe a better way of saying it is, in my own head, as I am not out, doing things with people.  Its this aggravating feeling in the pit of my stomach of sadness and loneliness.  It also seems to come because I know that school is on the way.  I've been on spring break for awhile and now it is ending.  Hold on a second......Ok, back.  I just called a friend, to go hang out and I am feeling better already.  Thats odd.  But also, deep down.  I have this realization that maybe, nothing causes these bouts of sadness.  That, yes, some little things come along to make me feel that way (they seem to occur towards the end of or in the middle of vacations, when I feel like I am doing nothing or that I will have to begin work again soon, when i feel useless basically).  But I have been through sadder things, and not felt this way, felt a healthy sadness that I dealt with.  I seem to realize now that maybe, I'm just fucked in the head.  That no matter how better I make myself, I will enver get past these occasional bouts with melancholia, just that hopefully they do not get worse.  I refuse tot ake medication, I will not, as normally, I am healthy and feel good about myself.  I honestly enjoy my life and think that I am living a good one now.  I will not take meds because I think they may get rid of those bouts of melancholia, but will also take down the happiness I feel soemtimes.  Give me a numb, or odd feeling.  Even if this is not true.  I do not think I am someone who needs medication.  SO what am I doing here?  I don't know.  I felt the need to talk about it.  Write about it.  Not to have some big epiphany or philosophical discussion of myself the way I normally do on xaznga (which...btw...never usally pan out, i alwas end up sad again, or depressed again, or fucked up again).  Just to honestly and openly try to examine myself and what I am feeling.  I believe the last time I felt this way was thanksgiving rbeak.  So, 2 or 3 times a  year for a few days.  I guess its something I will learn to live with.  In a way I feel like they fuel my passion for writing (and they definitely make me read, I devoured 150 pages today of overall pleasure reading just to keep my mind active).  Is it something I will deal with forever?  I hope not, but, maybe so.  Does it take certain things to make it come along?  Probably so.  Maybe I am just overall sensitive, and ceratin things in my life make me feel this way (sundays, often, I feel a part of this depression come, but not fully).  Maybe I just get depressed sometimes.  I sometimes still feel the urge to hurt myself, but never do, and I never feel the urge to kill myself anymore.  So I suppose I am making progress.  There are one or two things in my life going on that, could feasibly make me upset and confused, I will not divulge them here, they are a private affair between me and myself, besides school and work.  Maybe that is it.  I have come to no real conclusion here...and I probably have come off as slightly stupid.  Well, That is what I am I guess, I have no illusions that I know the answers to myself yet, and probably never will.  That will not happen in this life, but I do know that I want to document this, if only to try to put the tumult of emotions I am feeling down on paper.  For those who are interested, but mainly just for me, to help myself vent these emotions, to help myself feel better, which I can feel happening already, and to try to at least figure out some of the answers to myself.  I want to know who I am better.  That is what I am consistently doing, trying to learn who I am.

Anyawy, good night, I hope this didnt make anyone sad or offended or bored.  I love you all and shall talk to you all soon.

Sometimes I'm different than I am...if that makes sense to anyone than me."

"event","so awhile ago my friends and i did 5 best songs of the year lists...i realized, i messed up in my making of it, and realized more than i should do album
so
im making top 5 albums of the year along with my fave songs from those albums...(this is in absolutely NO order)
1. Bruce Springsteen - Devils & Dust, bruce delivers a new album that i had been waiting since 2002 for...goes back to a stripped acoustic sound, beuatiful songs here, fave 2, maria's bed and matamoras banks
2. Decemberists - Picaresque, just another new decemberists album, as usual, it pwns, fave 2 songs, prob The Engine Driver and 16 Military Wives
3. Coheed & Cambria - Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV Vol 1: Fear Through The Eyes of Madness, despite the mouthful of a title, its a grea tcoheed record, im sure i lose indie hipster cred for liking this band so much, but i do, so deal with it :-P with a somewhat new more rocking 80s sound, fave song, the writing writer
4. Wolf Parade - Apologies to Queen Mary, favorite NEW band of the year, i absolutely LOVED this fucking album, cant even pick a favorite song.
5. this was a tough decision between Sigur Ros and Spoon (and i was bothered that i couldnt put illinoise on here somewhere, but also, sufjan would be relegated to top 10, as would andrew bird, broken social scene and mountain goats and silver jews but i didnt WANT to to do a damn top 10, so sorry sufjan) but i ended up deciding on sigur ros, prob tracks 2-3, because it got me through alot more than spoon did (even tho i loved the spoon record alot and say you should buy it along with the others i listed, the 5 i listed are absolutely essential to me, if i listed 5 more, itd be albums i really really liked, but arent absolutely essential to me so i didnt wanna put them on a top 10 list, as they are just good, not favorites so i dont listen to them obsessively as classics like these top 5, not to mention the older albums i finally got into this year...ill stop talking now).  I may very well have put stars and deerhoof on here, but i havent heard their newest records yet, so i refused to make a top 10 list with them on there having not heard their album (yes, cue indie hipster obsessive compulsive jokes here)"

"event","So,
I was listening to Sigur Ros' new album today while driving home and I was looking at the beautiful environment around me of the snow on the trees and remembering the beatiful campus that I had just left.  Sigur Ros' music goes well, as it reminds me of the kind of barren snowy landscape I was seeing but it also reminds me of hope and beauty which snow does for me as well.  So when I got home I put on my walkman with Sigur Ros playing and took a walk, i walked around and threw snowballs and jumped in the snow like a kid again to a beautiful hopeful and rousing soundtrack and I realized, the past month or so, I've been feeling honestly good again.  I feel like I'm doing well, and although I have my hangups and fears and I despise class and I've had sad days, I'm actually good right now.  So anyway, go snow, go sigur ros, and lets hope for a snow day."

"event","ok, i needed to write.
I needed to force myself to think something out and become inside myself again. I needed to fully sit in front of the computer and force myself to think stuff out.
OK
lately I've been feeling really off, its difficult to explain.  I know it is all in my head, but the problem is that I can't control it too much.  I'm trying to teach myself to control it but its difficult (meditation is helping though).  Its like this...odd, feeling of not fully being in myself as I go around and do my daily activities.  It almost feels like I'm stoned, which I know because I have been and hated it with a passion, it caused me to bug and freak out and so, I will never do it again.  But its odd, ever since I had that happen to me, about a month ago I think, I've had this odd feeling, and the past 2 days its been alot worse than usual (yesterday was the worst, today isnt that bad).  I'm really worried that I have some sort of psychological issue, and that its finally coming up to bite me in the ass (ironically right when I feel like my life is going wonderful).  So, what I'm trying to do is this, make it the next couple weeks until I start going to therapy again.  I'm trying to force myself to relax and just...stop thinking about it (which anyone can tell you is hard to do, its like the whole ""dont think about the pink elephant"" syndrome).  I have to remember that people need me in my life and I can't let them down.  I know I'm not nuts because I am not breaking down, I am not having hallucinations, and I actually am going around behaving in a normal fashion, its just somehow what I feel mentally is...off, a bit.  Yesterday when I was with her alone I felt totally fine (which is good, that I have someone in my life that pulls me out of it).  I just have to lean on others a little and lean on myself.  Who knows, maybe I'll be a better person after all of this.

I feel better already."

Of u and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can u my darling
Can u picture this?

Dream if u can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and u

How can u just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just 2 demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father 2 bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other

When doves cry

Touch if u will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase u
Even doves have pride

"event","I was sitting on my back porch today listening to the world around me.  I was remembering what it felt like to slice a few days ago and how stupid it was of me to do that.  I smiled because I remembered what it felt like to make out, even though thats all it was, just a hook up with a girl, it still was wonderful.  I started listening and I heard kids laughing and playing outside and the clock ticking, and I started remembering what it felt like to be a kid, not worrying about everything I worry about now, then I started thinking of how i couldn't wait to raise one of those kids on my own, and try to provide for them a good life.  I started realizing how silly it is to worry about everything I worry about, but how these things are still real to me, and that I need to talk to thoe i need to talk to so that I can work these problems out, because even if they are silly, they are important.  I started thinking most of all though, how unpredicatble and, transitory this world is.  I started thinking about everything, how, I think our country can become fascist and destructive very soon, with few rights for people, how, our pollution and destruction of our environment can lead to our deaths and how the world is so dangerous that very bad things can happen very quickly.  And I started to realize that, we need to find and grab happiness, now...theres a chance for happiness?  Then take it.  Even if its a small thing, if you think it can make you happy and maybe help someone else, then grab it, and do it, and dont think so much about everything because...lives are short, they are probably going to get alot shorter alot quicker, there isnt alot of time to sit around and think forever.  If you see a chance for happiness...trust me, take it, its the only way to find it."

But I'm not depressed anymore, I'm not numb.  I fucking hate numbness, I hate this feeling of trapped that I feel all the time.  Like my life is pointless and nothing, I've been feeling numb since last summer, my only escape being those that I loved on campus, because I had no one else at that point...and now, my friends from before are back, those that should never have left.  And I'm in love, I've found the strongest love of my life...again heh (same girl as 2 years ago...weird how that shit works isnt it), and, who knows what will happen right?  Who FUCKING knows. She makes me feel so free in that love, she makes me feel like there are things in the world that are worth all the bullshit and horridness in this world, she is the most beautiful thing that I've ever been introduced to, and...well...just that I met her makes me feel so lucky that I cant complain.  I'm so over the top in love and it makes me feel so damn alive again that i just wanna go out side and scream to the world ""THIS IS ME! I'M BACK! I'M BRIAN AND I'VE BEEN LIVING A SAD NUMB LIFE FOR TOO FUCKING LONG NOW!""  finally Sarah will see me as I really am, this is me again guys...welcome back Marino."

I live in the Twentieth Century
and you lie here beside me. You
were unhappy when you fell asleep.
There was nothing I could do about
it. I felt hopeless. Your face
is so beautiful that I cannot stop
to describe it, and there's nothing
I can do to make you happy while
you sleep.

"event","someone talked about this on pitchfork media, i thought it was funny, and true, and i definitely love me some nice melodies:
Pop music gets off way too easily; so long as groups stick to only the sweetest melodies, throw in a couple of ba-ba-buh's and sing about how Stacey's mom ""has got it goin' on,"" or some other such timeless verse, they're valued as somehow above the fray. It seems even the most venomous rock elitists can be defanged by a few simple hooks, turned endlessly forgiving by some easy harmonies. If Stalin himself had ruled with less of an iron fist and more Beach Boys-style harmonies, he might be remembered as much for his keen songwriting chops as for the wholesale slaughter of millions of his own people; such is the inexplicably titanic redemptive power of pop."

Stupid job, bad pay, dangerous location, and water so foul the natives wouldn't even piss in it - this crowd of drunken motherfuckers hired by the local drug cartel showed up at my hotel room and threatened to tear me limb from limb. And I say, ""Listen hombres, OK, you got me outnumbered here four to one and you're gonna kill me here tonight and not a soul in this dimly lit world is gonna notice I'm gone. But one of you, one of you, one of you is gonna have his eye torn out. Period."" Silence. ""I repeat myself: One of you poor, underpaid jerks is gonna have an eye ripped out of its socket. I promise. It's a small thing perhaps, all things considered, but I will succeed, because it's the only thing I have left to do in this world. So why don't you just take a good look at one another one last time, and think it over a few minutes more.""

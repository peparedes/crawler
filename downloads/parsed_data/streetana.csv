"event","I got really depressed about the 'break' with me & Seth the day before yesterday; & I binged HORRIBLY.  

I ate CHINESE FOOD.  I felt sooo disgusting...but I've doen fairly well today & yesterday; & I walked a bunch to make up for it.

I ate:

8 kernels of popcorn: 75 cals (?)
2 bites of pizza crust: 50 cals (?)

TOTAL: 125 cals.  I'm not EVEN going to add up the chinese food.  It would just depress me more. :(

I excercised:

walked 3 1/2 miles
20 crunches

Ok; I suppose...but I really need to fast to make up for my binge-fest."

"event","Hum.  So Seth's not here & that makes me hungry.  I feel as though I might make-over my other journal -- it's starting to get a little stale.  I'm really tempted to add Lani or something...it's not like we don't have enough in common.  I want to find some secret fool-proof way to contact ehr & suggest the ana-buddy thing without it back-firign on me...grr.

I'm lonely & that makes me want to eat.  I'll go smoke a cigarette."

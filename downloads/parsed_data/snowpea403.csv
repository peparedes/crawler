"event","ugh i havent updated in a while, only becasue i have been lazy latly.  yesterday brittany came over, we didnt really do anything, she mostly just talked in stuff while i like did my hair in stuff.  then louis came over because we planned to chill thursday.  we didnt really do anything either.  but then i was reading sierras enteries from last year and i called to talk to her about a little incident we had, and then i asked her to come chill with us too. we watched slc punk.  it was an ok movie, kind of dumb and no point.  but worth watching.  then we got all happy and starting harassing this kid. ;)  yea it was fun.  well my plans for today are to go to the jazz festival with louisa and maybe i might see sierra there because she is supposed to go at the same time as me.  but what ever, i went lastyear too it was alright."

You feel your life is controlled internally.
If you want something, you make it happen.
You don't wait around for things to go your way.
You value your independence and don't like others to have control.

You are a realist when it comes to luck.
You don't attribute everything to luck, but you do know some things are random.
You don't beat yourself up when bad things happen to you...
But you do your best to try to make your own luck.

You have a good deal of power, but you also know the pecking order.
You realize that working the system does get you further.
You know who to defer to and who to control.
When it comes to the game of life, you play things flawlessly.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://blogthings.com/thethreedimensionluckandpowertest/"">The Three Dimension Luck and Power Test</a></div>"

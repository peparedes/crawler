If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words
That hurt you and you'd stay
I don't know why
I did the things I did
I don't know why
I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife
It can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons
They wound sometimes
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry
But baby

[Chorus:]
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words
That hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me
Love me like you used to do
If I could turn back time

My world was shattered
I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife
And drove it deep in my heart
You walked out that door
I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything
Darling then and there
Too strong to tell you
I was sorry
Too proud to tell you
I was wrong
I know that I was blind
And ooh

[Chorus]
 
CHER lyrics - ""I Got You Babe""
(feat. Sonny) 

 

They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we're grown
Well I don't know if all that's true
'Cause you got me, and baby I got you

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned,
Our money's all been spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure
Of all the things we got

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around

Don't let them say your hair's too long
'Cause I don't care,
With you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain
We can't climb

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
 
 Cher A Different Kind Of Love Song lyrics
What if the world was crazy and I was sane
Would it be so strange
I can't believe that I am alone in saying
The things I'm saying
I am part of you
These are universal truths
We're all a part of the light that flows through everything

This is a different kind of love song
Dedicated to anyone
Different kind of love song - whaoh, whao,
This is a different kind of love song
A higher plane we can flow on
Different kind of love song - Whaoh,Whao

What if the world calmed down and we all could breathe 
Together easily
Connecting the sky and the ground with you and me
And everything in between
I am part of you
We have living proof
There is some kind of light that flows through everything

This is a different kind of love song
Dedicated to everyone
Different kind of love song - whao,whao
This is a different kind of love song
A higher plane we can flow on
Different kind of love song - Whhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaoooooooo

This is a Diferent Kind of Love Song, Whao
This is a Differnent Kind of So-ong 

(Chours)- This is a Differnt Kind-(Cher) This is a differnet king of Love 
So-ong Whaooooooooooo Love Song, Whao ,whao 
This is a differnet kind of love song dedicated to everyone differnt kind of 
love Song,Whao, Whao
This is a difernet kind of love song a higher plane we can go on
Differnt Kind of Love Song (Whao)
Whao-o-o
This is a Differnt Kind of Love Song!
This is a differnet kind A differnt kind of Love So-ong (love Song)
Whao, Whao,ohh  

Cher (This Is) A Song For The Lonely lyrics
(HTML CODE incomplete in line 5)
This is a song for the lonely
Can you hear me tonight?
For the broken hearted, battle scared
I'll be by your sideBR> And this is a song for the lonely
When your dreams won't come true
Can you hear this prayer
'Cause someone's there for you
(CORRECTED)
This is a song for the lonely
Can you hear me tonight?
For the broken hearted, battle scared
I'll be by your side
And this is a song for the lonely
When your dreams won't come true
Can you hear this prayer
'Cause someone's there for you 

sorry thats soo long..those are just my 4 favorites.."

Lost my job, came home mad,
Got a hug and kiss and: ""That's too bad.""
She said: ""I can go to work until you find another job.""
I thought: ""I like the sound of that.""
Watch TV and take long naps.
Go from a hard working Dad to being Mr. Mom. 

Well, pampers melt in a Maytag dryer,
Crayons go up one drawer higher.
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time.
Breakfast, six; naps at nine.
There's bubblegum in the baby's hair,
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair.
Been crazy all day long,
And it's only Monday, Mr. Mom. 

Football, soccer and ballet:
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA.
And there's that shopping list she left that's seven pages long.
How much smoke can one stove make?
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake.
It's more than any man can take, being Mr. Mom. 

Well, pampers melt in a Maytag dryer,
Crayons go up one drawer higher.
Rewind Barney for the sixteenth time.
Breakfast, six; naps at nine.
There's bubblegum in the baby's hair,

Been crazy all day long,
And it's only Monday, Mr. Mom. 

Instrumental break. 

Before I fall in bed tonight,
If the dog didn't eat the classifieds,
I'm gonna look just one more time. 

'Cause pampers melt in a Maytag dryer,
Crayons go up one drawer higher.
Rewind Barney for the eighteenth time.

Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair.
Been crazy all day long, (All day long.)
Oh, been crazy all day long,
And it's only Monday, Mr. Mom.
Oh, Mr Mom. 

Balancin' checkbooks, juggling bills:
Thought there was nothing to it.
Baby, now I know how you feel,
What I don't know is how you do it.
Oh.

True To Your Heart 
by 98 Degrees 

Baby, I knew at once that you were meant for me
Deep in my soul I know that I'm your destiny
Though you're unsure, why fight the tide
Don't think so much, let your heart decide
Baby, I see your future and it's tied to mine
I look in your eyes and see you searching for a sign
But you'll never fall, 'Til you let go
Don't be so scared, of what you don't know

Chorus
True to your heart
You must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby, shower you with my love
Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
(Got to be true to your heart)

Someone you know is on your side can set you free
I can do that for you if you believe in me
Why second-guess, what feels so right
Just trust your heart, and you'll see the light

Chorus

(Ya know it's true) Your heart knows what's good for you
(Good for you) Let your heart show you the way
(Ya know it's true) It'll see you through
(Got to be true to your heart)
Girl, my heart is driving me to where you are
Well, you can take both hands off the wheel and still get far
Be swept away, enjoy the ride
You won't get lost
With your heart to guide you.
Chorus (2times)
When things are gettin' crazy (crazy)
And you don't know where to start (to start)
Keep on believin', baby (baby)
Just be true to your heart
When all the world around you (baby)
It seems to fall apart (apart)
Keep on believin', baby (baby)
Just be true to your heart
(Got to be true to your heart)
Repeat till fade"

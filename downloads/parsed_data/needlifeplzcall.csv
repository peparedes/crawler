it's all that damn snow, that comes down, UNANNOUNCED, and hinders you from going out on a Friday night. But all throughout the week monday through thursday it CAN'T come down...so you CAN'T have a snowday..and you HAVE to go to school, but on a simple, plain, regular friday night it has to make up for lost time and snow you in.

i hate winter.

ps. it's almost an oxymoron for it to be too snowy that you can't drive to go snowboarding. ...yes this has happend to me."

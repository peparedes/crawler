"event","today was fun and shitty
went to my sisters graduation.
hung out with jake most the time.
that was cool i suppose.
he is very touchy.
then i went on the feild like everyone does to take pictures and such.
i was secretly wanting to see him the whole time.
looking around and hoping for maybe one second of eye contact.
and then i see him.
and then i see my mother hugging him. and kiss him on the cheek.
i was very upset.
<u>I</u> wanted to be the one hugging him. <u>I</u> wanted to be the one kissing him on the cheek.
<u>I</u> wanted to be the one congratulating him on graduating highschool.
but no. thats pretty sad im jealous of my mother.
but yes i saw him.
no eye contact. no nothing.
i doubt he even saw me. he just looks <s>right</s> through me. 
its like im invisable or something.
i felt really embarrased because i wanted to cry <b>So</b> bad because i know that i will probably never see him again. 
and i thought i could hold it in but this time i couldnt.
im just glad it wasnt untill we were in the parking lot.
i couldnt have let him see me cry again.
he would think im weak and thats something i cant be.
thats why i pretend to hate him and pretend to think he is really ugly and such
all my real friends know that im pretending but they go along with it.
i dont know.
i just. i wonder if he ever thinks of me.
i wonder if he sometimes lays in bed at night and just thinks about me.
because thats what i find myself doing everynight before i go to bed.
i want to know so badly what was going on inside of his mind april.21 when he drove away from my house for the last time after just breaking my heart. 
did he feel sad? happy? free? 
i hope he doesnt forget me.
i feel like he somewhat has. 
i feel like when he sees me he just looks past me like im just some girl who he had a class with or something like that.
i dont know.
it is shitty.
i wish we still talked but that is never going to happen.
it is impossible because everytime we speak i have the urge to tell him how badly i need him back.
i just want to spill my heart out to him and tell him how everything was perfect when he was here. even when we were fighting.
i want to tell him how he could ALWAYS make me feel better. 
i want to tell him how shitty things have been without him.
i want to tell him how SORRY i am for whatever i did that made him fall out of love with me. 
but i cant.
he wouldnt understand.
and thats just something ill have to learn to accept"

"event","Take it back, take it all back now 
The things I gave 
Like the taste of my kiss on your lips 
I miss that now 

I can't try any harder than I do 
All the reasons I gave, excuses I made for you 
I'm broken in two 

All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me empty and left to wonder 
I need you
All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me waiting and left to wonder 
I need you 
Yeah I need you 
Don't walk away 

Touch me now, how I wanna feel something so real 
Please remind me, my love 
And take me back 
Cause I'm so in love with what we were 
I'm not breathing, I'm suffocating without you 
Do you feel it too 

All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me waiting and left to wonder 
I need you 
All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me empty and left to wonder 
I need you 
Yeah I need you 

When I'm in the dark and all alone 
Dreamin' that you'll walk right through my door 
It's then I know my heart is whole 
There's a million reasons why I cry 
Hold my covers tight and close my eyes 
Cause I don't wanna be alone 

All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me waiting and left to wonder 
I need you 
All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me empty and left to wonder 
I need you 
I need you 

Cause I can't fake 
And I can't hate 
But it's my heart that's about to break 
You're all I need 
I'm on my knees 
Watch me bleed 
Would you listen please 

I give in 
I breathe out 
I want you 
There's no doubt 

I freak out 
I'm left out 
Without you 
I'm without 

I'm crossed out 
I'm kicked out 
I cry out 
I reach out 

Don't walk away 
Don't walk away 
Don't walk away 
Don't walk away"

i used to miss having a boyfriend because i had nobody to kiss and hang out with.
but now its not that.
not even close to it in fact.
i miss having someone to talk to. 
someone who i can tell EVERYTHING to and not have them judge me.
someone that will assure me that everything will be okay. and not to worry.
i used to have that.
and now its gone.
and i miss it.
alot.
i know i have my best friends to talk to. 
but its not the same.
i guess i liked having a boys point of veiw on somethings.
i dont know.
i just liked it alot better when i KNEW for a fact that someone would be there for me. 
someone who loved me no matter what crazy things i thought.

last night... we were at chris' (like we are everynight) but yeah.. and my friend Aaron came in... steve and chris were jammin... so i was sitting there chillin listening to their jam cuz when i go in the jam room its too loud to hear the music properly... haha... anyway... and Aaron comes in and goes ""guess what i've got..."" and i am like ""what?""... i was excited cuz Aaron made it sound exciting... and he was like ""MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE'S RAP CD!!""  and so i was like ""WWWWWHHHHAAAATTTT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?""  

steve and chris were having one of the best jams they have ever had and i was totally into it... but as soon as Aaron told me that i was like ""OMG!!!!  WE MUST LISTEN TO IT RIGHT NOW!!!""  and he started laughing... and so i put it on right then and there... let me tell you... MACHO MAN IS PISSED!!!   haha...

but yeah... it was actually pretty good... in a funny sort of way... haha... Aaron heard about it in the new AP.. (alternative press) its on the very last page (inside the back cover) on the bottom left corner... its a small blurb about it... but if you are somewhere where they have AP check it out cuz its too classic!!! hahaha.... 

anyway... just wanted to share that with all of you cuz i thought it was toooooooo funny!!!  we all just sat there laughing our asses off...

OH yeah... and there is a track on it that is like this tribute to Mr. Perfect and its called ""MY PERFECT FRIEND""... PURE CHEESE... SOOOOO FUNNY!!!!

k... peas!!!!!"

"event","hello all...  *waves a big queen style wave*  even though i hate the way she waves!!!

man i haven't updated in sooo long i am not sure where to even begin!

first... i would like to say thanks to those who dropped me messages in my first message!  JERS, MELEXXX, MATTY McFACE, and PANDOFF the little russian boy with one arm!  i was shocked to see i had such dedicated readers!  hehe

well let me just say the last six months have been interesting to say the least... i will try to make this short but brief...

i fell in love (hard)... his name is steve... and he fell just as hard... he has liked me for 3 years so it was evident he was going to... no complaints here though!  we are the ultimate couple and we fully agree upon that...*sigh*... he is my best friend and the other half of my heart!

for some reason when steve and i first got together, about 3 weeks into our relationship my friends stopped calling me and stopped calling me back when i would call them... which was like every other day... just recently re-united with most of them though... turns out it was good that we all went our seperate ways cuz some of them started hitting the coke pretty hard and other such goings on happened... i can definitely say i didn't want to be a part of that scene so i guess things do happen for a reason!  they have all since quit and are working on bettering themselves as people and bettering their lives... well i am speaking mainly of my one friend cuz she realized she is worth sooo much more than that lifestyle... anyway...

in that time i did not have the net and found it very hard not being able to talk to my friends abroad!  i felt very cut off from the world!  

i got the net a little over a week ago and i am very thankful for that!  i was saddened to find out my emmy g has endured more heartache but she has james and he loves her muchly and so i know she was taken care of but i still feel awful for not being there!  i love you em... think of and thought of you always (ask steve... haha)... BFF!!!

ok enough mushy stuff... or is it?

i am still looking for a dental hygiene job so i still hold a job at the good old A&P... i hate it and can't wait to leave... but what can i say?!  its a job!  2 nights ago a dental hygienist my dentists office called me though to tell me her friend at another practice in wasaga beach is quitting to go work for public health so she told me to go apply right away... so i went yesterday as soon as i got off work... so all of you should cross your fingers for me.. i asked god to help me get this job and to make that my bestest christmas present... i would be happy is that was my one and only christmas present!

speaking of christmas presents... my plan for a long time now has been to get steve a really nice hand drum!  i wasn't sure though if he would want to play it first and hear the sound of it... so one night we were laying in bed talking about christmas and presents and such and i said to him ""i am not sure about your present cuz i think you may want to pick it out... so i kind of want to tell you what it is and that way you can tell me if you would rather pick it.."" and he was like ""ok what is it?"" and so i told him and he was like ""nah baby... i trust you so you just go ahead and pick it out"" and then he went on to say ""but in reality you shouldn't get me that b/c you hardly have any money and that is a pricey gift""  and so i was like ""yeah you're right... but we'll see what happens.""

so when i went shopping... i hardly had any money... but luck was on my side that day... i got my mom a portable phone with caller ID and a T-Fal frying pan... cuz she thinks those frying pans are the best... haha... and then i went to this other store in our tiny mall... its not even a real store its just a little store in like this small area thats built into the wall... we have a few of those in our mall... anyway... they sell like tribal stuff sort of and they had a really nice hand drum there... its wooded and hand carved... sooo nice so i asked how much it was and it was only $109... so i was like HOOK ME UP... i didn't have quite enough for it though so i had to put a down payment on it... i am going back today to pay the rest and bring it home...  so then i told steve that got his present that i was sad cuz i didn't have enough money to get him the drum that i had wanted to get him and he was like ""thats ok i know you have no money""  but i really played it up that i was overly sad about it... it was awesome... haha... so now he thinks he is getting something else and the look of excitement and surprise on his face will be a christmas present in itself for me!!!

my poor baby is getting 2 teeth yanked today... his 2 top wisdom teeth... but its a goosd thing cuz one is in bad shape and is causing him pain... but i of course will be there to love and hug him in his time of need... but then again.. i am there to do that on a daily basis and thats all i do everyday!  haha... wait... i thought i said enough of this mushy shit... haha...

but yeah... i think thats really all... well i mean... six months is a long time and soo much happens... but too much happens to throw in here...

oh one more thing actually... and this one is interesting... well i think it is anyway... steve's best friend chris ( who i have known as long as steve and is my friend too) but he write and directs movies and we just finished working on a music video like a month ago.. but i got to do all of the makeup for it and i transformed steve into a zombie with this bloody wound on his face... it was sooo fun!!!

steve said chris told him that he is in the midst of writing a scrpit that i am either the main girl character in or the main character... steve said chris didn't really say he just said that its a main character and that chris said he thinks i am perfect for it... so thats kewl... but yeah... other than that... not much else to say... haha...

merry christmas too all or whatever you do or don't celebrate at this time... have fun either way!!!

EM have a blast in jamaica... although i know you have already left and are there by now... just have fun... you and your mumsie deserve it!!

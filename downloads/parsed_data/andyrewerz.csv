"event","I haven't written anything since last year.  Yeah I'm workin' at Discount Tire Company on Albemarle road near Harrisburg road.  No...I can't give you a discount (ironically...).

So...I noticed some folks using Bellsouth and some using Alltel are coming here....YET NOT COMMENTING.  If you're gonna come by and stalk me yet not tell me you were here...I'll be upset.  I can tell who's been visiting this Mofo' and want you to say something.  Not you Courtney...

Courtney and I are great.  We had a great Christmas.  I ordered an Xbox 360 last week...it should be here tomorrow...HOPEFULLY.  I start my spring semester at UNCC too.  No Friday classes...woot!  I have three day weekends til summer!

I don't feel like typing no mores :p"

"event","Right now marks the 1st year, 1st month, 9th day, 9th hour and 45th minute I've been in love with Courtney.  Over that whole year and some odd days, there have been times where we have shared many happy moments, many romantic moments, and unfortunatly some less-than-happy moments.  But if someone were to offer me everything I wanted and in return they want my future with Courtney, I'd tell them that I already have everything I want and it lies in what they want from me.

We both know that I have been a horrible lover to her sometimes, and I'm writing this to apologize for that.  I want her to know that everytime she's thought I don't care about her, don't want to be with her, don't want anything to do with her, I've always felt so stupid for that and can only wish that I can tell her how much she means to me.  I made the decision a long time ago that I'm done looking.  I don't want anyone else.  Everything I want she has.  She has shown me what a perfect girlfriend is like, and what kind of a life I can expect from a girl of her caliber.  I feel pride knowing that people associate me with her.  At Arby's, where I used to work, <i>everyone</i> associated her with me.  She came in a couple times, too, before a concert and honestly knocked the guys flat on their asses.  I can only imagine what kind of an impact she'd make at Discount Tire where the only people that work there are guys.

I can only think of one thing to sum up how I feel in one short sentence:  I love Courtney Guthrie with every ounce of me."

"event","Hmm....been a while.  For those who still read this, here ya go:

I got a new <a href=""http://w6.photobucket.com/widgets/dynamicflash.php?featuretype=bucketshow&featurename=Diesel&pa=/y206/Slapfish/Diesel%20Truck/"">diesel truck</a>, K?  Since were switching my truck's body onto that one's chassis, I was working on the new truck's body. (The ""new"" truck is actually 3 years older)  I was standing on a chest thing in our garage to reach a creeper, those things that you lay on and slide under cars, on the top shelf.  I jumped back down but caught the brick step leading to the door to our house in the garage.  Initially I thought it was a bruise.  Then I figured it was a busted blood vessel.  I let it go while I was at work. When I got home, it had grown a small bit.  I took my nail clippers and made a TINY incision to let the blood out, to avoid clotting.  After I mopped the gushing blood (I.e. dripping onto a tissue for like 30 seconds.  Slowly.) ,  I hydrogen peroxided it and put a non Band-Aid brand band-aid on.  All better :)


BTW, if you didn't know I worked at Arby's, I do.  The one at Lawyers and Wilson Grove/Lebanon/Margaret Wallace.  The one across from Independence High School.  Come visit me, I work evenings mainly.  Text me if you wanna confirm I'm working that night (704-724-9076).  Abuse that number and die.

Yes, Courtney and I are fine.

Any other questions?  Comment!"

"event","I won't insult your knowledge.  You know where I am now.  Glad to be here.  On the way home however, I beleive I was traumatized.  If you read in the news about a horrible motorcycle accident on 485 near Harrisburg road, I was about 2 minutes behind it.  I was driving and I pulled up to what I thought was a shoe thrown from an accident.  There was part of the motorcycles dude leg still in it.  I had to stop and switch driving with my dad because he was more experienced and could get us through the cars and whatnot, but I walked about a foot (no pun intended) from that severed limb.  I ended up parking next to it because I had to, and my dad had to jump over it and I had to walk right next to it.  Folks I was staring at about 15 inches of foot and bloody bone.  The dude was laying on the side of the road further up with his legless zone tourniqetted and his other leg broken horrible.  The hell of it all is that him and his buddy passed me about 15 minutes earlier, not speeding or anything.  So yeah, I saw a guy in two parts.  In person.  Eerie...

Anyways...here's some badass pictures of the Niagara falls....and some of me.

You know that whole...being on your best behaviors most girls act like for the first month or so, then stop acting like they care and get a case of the ""me me me"" complex like Mrs. Michael says...all cause it's not how they want the guy to act?  She hasn't grown out of that.  She's still acting like she loves me.  I love it! I love her!  Do we have the perfect relationship?  Yes.  What's wrong with it? Honestly...what?  We love eachother for personality...and we think the other looks awesomely sexy.  Looks <i>are</i> important, I don't care who you are.  But her personality is what really makes her shine.  I don't know why I didn't realize this so long ago when we first became friends.  I don't feel scared to tell her things because maybe what she believes will get in the way...or maybe she'll find it immature or whatever.  Nah, none of that...she acts her age.  I love it.  She's not stupid by any stretch of the imagination either.  She's smarter than me and I admit that hands down.  I don't feel dumb when I talk to her....but she's got booksmarts and...the other kind of smarts.  And she loves the exact same music!  Wahoo.  It's hard to stop writing good things about her..."

She may or may not know what kind of a person I'm beyond glad she is.  She's made me so happy these last 3.5 months we've been dating, and I can only hope for many many many more.  If I had to fill out a little survey that asked me what I wanted in a girl then it gave me the combination of my answers, she's my result.  She's helped me be truely me.  I'm not afraid to tell her anything because it might offend her.  I'm not afraid to talk to her because she might snap back at me or something.  She's the nicest, sweetest, most wonderful person to be around and you can ask anyone who I talk to/hang out with.  I love to be with her and I love to invite her places.  She shows me she loves me where we're out together, even though we aren't hanging off eachother every second we're together.  And even though we aren't attached at the hip...we're definitely attached at the brain.  We know exactly what the other is thinking without really talking to them much.  I know I probably get on her nerves a bit, but I know she forgives me and I know she loves me no matter what.  That's true love folks.

So, with that, Happy Valentine's day, thank you, and I love you Courtney."

"event","Man.  I never thought my dad would ever get like this.  Here's the problem:  he's tired of paying for gas.  It comes out to like 150-200 dollars a month.  Thats a crazy amount to be spending.  My idea is to sell the truck and get an older diesel for great mileage.  I can get an old Mercedes diesel in great condition for what my truck is worth.  Great reputation, awesome comfort and reliability, great mileage, actually cheaper to buy than my truck probably.  My dad doesn't want to.  I assume it's because he wants to keep the truck because it's cool.  The reasons that's a horrible reason are: he never drives it, if he needs to pull something hes got a healthy diesel Liberty, he doesn't like driving it, it's not very comfortable.  It's a no brainer to sell that truck and get something cheaper and better on gas.  But no...he won't do it.  I guess I need to talk to him tomorrow.

I'm so annoyed...things started to suck tonight very fast once I asked him about it."

There wasn't a trace of a Ford, Toyota, or Dodge.

The presents were wrapped, and the lights were all lit,
So I figured I'd mess, with the Silverado a bit.

I popped the release, and I lifted the hood,
When a deep voice behind me said, ""looks pretty good.""

Well as you can imagine, I turned mighty quick,
And there by the workbench, stood good ol Saint Nick!

We stood there a bit, not too sure what to say,
Then he said ""don't suppose that you'd trade for my sleigh?""

I said ""no way Santa"", and started to grin,
""But if you've got the time, we could go for a spin!""

His round little mouth, all tied up like a bow,
Turned into a smile and he said, ""Hey! Let's go!!""

So as not to disturb, all the neighbors' retreat,
We pushed the Silverado, quietly out to the street.

Then taking our places, to drift down the hill,
I turned on the key, and I let the clutch spill.

The sound that erupted, took him by surprise,
But he liked it a lot, by the look in his eyes.

With the tires a' cryin', and exhaust pipes aglow,
We headed out where, the hot rodders go.

And Santa's grin widened, approaching his ears,
With every shift up, as I went through the gears.

Then Santa yelled, ""I've never felt so alive!""
So I backed off the gas, and said ""you wanna drive?""

Ol Santa was stunned, when I gave him the keys,
When he walked past the headlights, he shook at the knees!

The Big block exploded, with dual exhaust sound!
Santa let out the clutch and the tires shook the ground!

Power shift into second, again into third!
I sat there just watching, a loss for a word.


Then I heard him exclaim, as we blasted from sight,

""Merry Christmas to all...........have a hell of a night!!!"""

Tonight was a blast!  I headed over to courtney's about 3:15 and stayed 'til like...12:30.  We pretty much farted about until it got close to midnight.  We had balloons, silly string, confetti poppers, and ""champagne"" ready.  I finally had someone to kiss for new year's, too :).  Tonight we all played Life.  Since there weren't enough cars, Courtney and I shared one.  It might only have been a game, but I found it very cute when we were talking about my career as a country entertainer making 80,000 a year.  We had one girl, Belle, and adopted two boys, Bill and Eddie.  We all lived on a farm house.  While just a game, again, I still thought it was nice pretending to be living like that.  I so can picture Courtney and me living like that, not to jinx it or anything.  Man, why is she so...awesome?  I can't think of one word to describe her.  Pretty much every positive word.

I think she's been pretty amazed as to why I'm so nice to her and her family.  Now don't get me wrong, I want to be known for being nice, but I think her family deserves more than that.  They've been through a lot and get a lot of crap.  They're very nice people and that gets taken advantage of sometimes.  The least they deserve is people to be nice to them."

"event","Grr...this weekend just sucked.  Friday night I went to a Checkers game with Caitlin and Lisa and Caitlin's family and it was really fun and all.  Later on we all went to Caitlin's house and met Laura, Bobby and Courtney.  Unfortunatly my dad managed to set the perfect curfew where I only got to see her for like 10 minutes.  I did, however, tell them about Courtney and me, so they know.  Today, though, was pretty bad.  I ended up sitting around the morning 'til Courtney got home.  She was supposed to come right over here after her little key club thing, but her brother was really sick.  She had to stay there for a bit then we met up at the place where we were going to do our holiday concert for my guitar school.  We barely managed to practice at all.  The thing ran late.  We didn't do so hot.  She was scared.  And since it was so late, our plans of going to her house were foiled because her mom was mad she wasn't home at 5.  She understood our time of being there of 3:30 as what time we went on.  We didn't go on until 6:30.  So I'm really pissed off right now because of fucking laws not letting me drive after 9, just in case her mom does ease up.  I'm <i>really</i> hoping that stupid transmission in the old jeep comes out okay so she can spend her day there.  I really want to see her for a while this weekend.  I also owe Lisa like 20 dollars because my dad snapped and won't give me money anymore.  It's not my fault Autobell won't interview me and start paying me.  Why can't life always be good?"

""Over 1.1 million words in the English language, and not one of them can describe the feeling.""

Although it may apply to driving the car, it also seems to apply to my relationship life.  I honestly can't believe it is what it is.  I've never been so open and so trusting and so confident with any girl before Courtney.  Humor is such a big part of our relationship, it's not even funny.  No, wait, yes it is.  Poor thing is sick right now with strep throat.  Luckily her doctor said she should be over it within the next couple days.

BTW I've got a parking pass now, if anyone wants a ride and didn't want to walk way out to my truck before, provided I have gas.  Any guys should take me up on that offer because, well, the truck is simply a chick magnet.  If you're in need of some action you can probably ride in my truck, point at a girl, and score some booty.  It's that easy.  I won't even charge you.  Well maybe I will...unless you just use my truck for transportation needs."

In other news: my truck.  I think the transmission is on it's last leg.  I stopped just outside of my driveway to scrape more ice off this morning.  When I shifted into park I heard it make a somewhat loud metallic banging noise, which isn't normal.  When I left that spot, there was definite gear whine, which also isn't good.  Anyone know someone with a wicked TH400 they don't want?  I could use a bulletproof three-speed in the Juan Jeremy.

Besides school, I think I have it made.  A truck cooler than anyone else's, I might be getting a job at a car service station (meaning I get paid for working on cars), some of the best friends again, and last but certainly not least, the world's greatest girlfriend.  I now realize what I've wanted in a girlfriend because of Courtney.  Woo!  She's kept me sane and happy constantly.  It's so cool.  Which segways into school.  Senioritis.  I believe that sums it up.  I've concluded my three classes I might could do without:  English, Statistics, and Bible.  Why Bible?  Because that class is a whole buncha worship and stuff.  I thought they weren't supposed to do that.

Anyways...I hope everyone is having a wonderful holiday season.

By the way...I benched 190 today suckers!  While not much, it's nearing my goal of 200+...woopie!

Last thing:  what my truck is capable of...while I doubt it's ability now that it's rather crippled from that blast in 27 degree weather.

I met Courtney, Bobby, Thomas, and Courtney's friend Malia at Sycamore Commons, then we went to stonecrest, walked around for a bit then met up with Laura and Caitlin.  We drove over to Lisa's restaurant and visited her for a while.  It was honestly the coolest reunion tour.  We went over to Courtney's for a bit and played video games and sat around and...man it was just fun.  I honestly missed those guys.  It's good to be back.  I'm glad I found them as friends again.

I'm just worried that I won't have the constant availible contact with my friends whenever I want until I prove my grades improved.  Friends keep me here, especially Courtney.  I'm so glad I have her now, everything is falling into place so correctly and perfectly.  All I wish is that my study habits get better so I can better my grades.

There they are, bulging in their shirts, sobbing over this man.  It's pretty amazing realizing whats making these giants cry.  Eddie Guerrero was one of the best men to know, not just in that business either.

Now, I'm in a much better mood.  I talked to Bobby tonight and told him how I felt.  It felt pretty good to get that off my shoulders.  I have a free conscience now and it honestly feels great.

So anyways.  These last couple weeks have been particularly stress-free and enjoyable.  I picked someone up, got rid of senior exit, and made old friends new again.  I got a new cell phone from one of them too!  It's purty.  Motorola V551 if you want to go Google images/whatever else.  We also got an old mail keep because my mom got her job at the Post Office.  She starts in a week or two or something like that.  For now my dad's getting it here from Texas.  The alternator went bad, which powers everything when the car is running, so they had to bypass the headlights.  That means he has no headlights.  He can't drive in the dark.  He has probably 12 hours to go...and he can only drive from about 6am to 6pm.  

I can't believe how good I felt when I was walking around outside to get the paper.  It felt really good and everything.  Hooray for donuts, and yay life!

One last thing...I painted the grille of my truck black.  Check it under the cut.

"event","Tonight was quite possibly the best night I've had ever.  Seriously.  It was spent at a corn maze, then I joined up with my donut and went to a family friend's house for merriment.  He always has a party around Halloween.  It was a bunch of good ole' southern guys, awesome music and excellent barbeque.  And a bonfire my pretty little donut and I pretty much sat at the whole time.  It was the perfect temperature and everything.  The night went absolutely wonderfully.  We walked back to my house for like 30 more minutes before she had to leave.  'Twas the best night ever.  :)  Hope we have many more nights like that..."

"event","Jacen went to his small windowless room and knew what he had to do. He had to find this woman, he had known from the moment that he touched her in the street that she would be the salvation or destruction of this world. He had seen her bathed in shining light, healing the world from destruction with her tears, she put her soul into the world to save it.. but he had also seen the destruction at those same hands. 
    He didn't know how to even begin to change her path from one to the other but he had to so something. He was given this curse, this burden, and knew that he couldn't just sit back and watch the world engulfed in flames to be obliterated before him. 
    He made his way back to the little windowless room in the back of The Silver Cutlass that had been his home for the last several weeks. As he stumbled past patrons and fumbled with the lock on the door he knew it would be the last time he made this trek, he wouldn't be coming back here again. 
    Jacen began gathering his few possessions, those which he hadn't sold for stronger drink in the last weeks. For the first time in months he had found renewed purpose. When Tania and Malkis had been taken away he had sought only retribution, he had stormed the hillside and seen that there was justice done for the family, the happiness that he had lost. The Gods had chosen to curse him with the sights of what was to come and everywhere he went there only seemed to be more impending tragedy and all of it had led him here.
    This shining palace of light, Jacen knew, was the source of all the darkness he had been fighting against. Once he had made it past the gates and into the city itself he had felt lost. All of his travels and all of his visions had brought him here, to the center of it all and then left him to wander the streets. He had tried several times to be granted an audience with the famed children of the light but to no avail. 
    He didn't need them now, he had found her."

"event","there are moments when my head seems to cloud, when all the junk and the life seems to back up and there is no escape... no escape but this. critics come and say what you will but at the end of the day i'll be the one standing. there is something strong in me, i'm not sure what it is but it won't give up. it won't give up on me or on my life, it won't let me give up on myself. i'm not sure what that means sometimes and i feel as if i'm alice eternally falling down the rabbit hole. nothing will ever be the same as it was yesterday or like it will be tomorrow.

i've tried so hard to let things go, but i guess that's kind of the point of life isn't it? you muddle through and things stick to you. some are bad, and you wish you could just wash it all away, but some are good. i know people always say to make the best of your situation but sometimes it just sucks, there is no best at that moment. sometimes there is only pain & grief, rage & emptiness. it seems so cantradictory to feel things like rage and still be empty. welcome to humanity, we are the great contradiction. look around and see what we are, what we're becoming. 

people rise & they fall. that is the way of life, something has to die for something else to step in and take it's place. some people are mostly good and some are mostly evil. is it in our genes? our surroundings? our souls? there really isn't any way to say. we all have the potential for great good and great evil, all of us, every one. maybe some carry more bags than others but isn't it our job as a community, as a race, to help with the burden? how have humans seemed to lose their humanity? 

sometimes bad things happen to good people and sometimes good things happen to bad people. all of life is good and all of life is bad. every decision you make effects other people. all of your life effects the lives of others. if you can't make your life work for you, make it work for them. 

sometimes its hard to see past all the ugliness. sometimes its too hard to look at someone who's hurt you and truly forgive. i hold no grudges. my life has been mine to choose, sometimes i have chosen wrong but it was my choice to make. some of the paths i walked down i never thought i could never make it back from, some i never did. life isn't one long road, it's a journey. stop as often as you can.

it builds and builds, i can feel it, it's an almost tangible thing. its like smoke being pumped in and coalescing to form... something. something real and alive, deadly and beautiful, soft and explosive. there is something in there, even if nobody else can ever feel it, ever see it. 

sometimes things just come out. i don't want to say it, i even try not to, but it happens. i cant seem to stop myself. why can't i stop? why can't i stop this thing that romps through my head and fucks up my judgement. this thing that tells me what's wrong and right and doesn't seem to have a clue.

i hear it calling. it starts like a background noise, gentle lapping of waves across the sand, the droning of the sea, never at peace, never truly still. it never rests, ever, but then the storm comes and you never expect it. on occasion you see the dark clouds forming but you can never tell how bad it's going to be or just when it'll hit. i try to control it. sometimes it works, sometimes it just delays a bigger shitstorm.

for all of the creativity & uniqueness that people claim they rarely surprise me. i feel jaded, i've seen it all. i've looked into the face of humanity, for the truly horrific or the truly benevolent, but the average, the makeup of what humanity is really comprised of, i'm not impressed. is this how we all are? we all think we're so special and wonderful, are we really? is your fucked up you?

is the great revelation that we're all truly unhappy & completely blissful all at the same time? i've seen the world laid before me, as so many others and yet i can seem to make my way down that road. i've lived it all and never lived.i'm a part of life but not alive.

so may days go by empty, they shouldn't be. that is my addiction. it's not the people, it's not the emotions, it's the being free. it's being in a moment where i can be me and not pretend anymore. sometimes you just have to let go and let the mask slip, just a little. that is what this life is about. the hard part is letting the mask slip and not covering it up. 

tell me i'm wrong, and i'll try to believe you. i want to believe in goodness and that somewhere is someone just as fucked up in just the right ways. the person that can understand the code and live by it while still accepting that certain things are just the way of life. 

these moments are timeless and can never be counted. never should be."

"event","the thought of him with someone else, it makes her ill, hate herself. 
she should have tried harder though she did her best, she prays to god this is just a test. 
she thought they could be a family but i guess it wasn't meant to be. 
a daughter that looks just like him, why am she so easy to leave on a whim?
she'll never be good enough, he said she was but that's a bluff.
the lies hurt more than all the rest, to know that it was just pretend
a husband, a father, a lover, a friend, and still ishe's alone in the end. 
maybe this is what she deserves, maybe she never stood a chance.
he use to smile and bring her roses, but that was just fake romance
she thought that he would understand, her once heartbroken man.
he said he wanted a family but she sits heartbroken as he leaves. 
not strong enough, not pretty enough, 
not a good enough mother, not good enough wife, 
not good enough to be part of his life.
she makes a whis, where's that magic star? that love will prevail after all.
anything, everything, she'd give it all to have just one more shot
she'd give up her heart, her soul, her life if love was what it bought.
she's screaming inside, trying to hide, needing the pain to stop
but still it goes on for her love is too strong and nothing can cut it off.
he said he'd tried but he lied she just wants another chance
to put the pieces back together to save her one romance. 
she knew it inside, you were trying to hide but love had blinded her
she sits and prays for something to change but maybe she's the curse.
she tries so hard to make him smile but nothing can make him happy,
except another, another lover, with her he's always laughing.
she begs and pleads 'what can i do?' but silence fills the air
she wants a simple answer, straightforward, but nothing's there.
to late, he says, i dont want to try, im just to miserable here
she hangs her head, thoughts filled with dread, this was her worste fear.
all she wanted was to hold on to her chance at happiness
to think that there was love in his wonderful caress.
but he has another who must be better it's driving her insane
to wonder still how far it's gone, she doesnt even know her name.
another sleepless night will pass because she doesnt understand
how could all this heartache and pain come from what she thought was a true man?
he swears his love but thenagain it's proably another lie
she prays to god, he'll changehis mind, and give it another try.
he'll never know how bad it hurts to be here in her shoes
she just keeps hope that maybe someday she'll be the one he'll choose."

it breaks my heart to watch my marriage fall apart infront of me. i really honestly thought that you loved me as much as i love you but once again i guess i was wrong. i'm in tears everysingle day and you just dont care. i tell you that my best friends father passsed away and you just go on talking about work like i dont even exist. you have no fucking clue what this is like.you tell me that i should talk to the doctor about post patum depression... are you fucking kiddin gme?! you think that is why im depresed? 

i hate to say it but im about ready to give up. i love you but i guess that it isnt enough when it's only one sided. i thought that you would be there for me and for jaela but you're just not. you made a promise to me once that i would always come before work. that's the only promise you ever made that i there was a chance you would keep. it's good to know now that you lied. you're always either at work, talking about work, working on stuff for work, or planning things for work. you always talk about how jessica was the one to blame for you not seeing andrew or being able to spend time with him... i'm not so sure that's true anymore. you avoid your own daughter like a disease, it's pathetic.

when you're a child minutes seem to creep by like hours but the older you get the faster time seems to start racing along. part of me wishes i could be a kid again but there is the other part of me that loves my life too much. of course, like anyone, there are a few things that i would change. i would be rich and none of my friends or family would ever need for anything ever again, i would have a beautiful house, andrew and i would have a big wedding & our own shop... and a set of nice harley's lol. 

some days present life seems like too much to handle but i guess that's just how it goes. the way i see it, you cant really appriciate the good days unless you have a few bad days once in awhile."

[Part 1]

I'm the son of raging love
The Jesus of Suburbia
From the bible of none of the above
On a steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my sins in hell
As far as I can tell
At least the ones I got away with

And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me

Get my television fix sitting on my crucifix
The living room or my private womb
While the moms and brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane
To keep me insane and doing someone else's cocaine

And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me

[Part 2: City Of The Damned]

At the center of the Earth
In the parking lot
Of the 7-11 where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says home is where your heart is
But what a shame
Cause everyone's heart
Doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to care

I read the graffiti
In the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much
But it only confirmed that
The center of the earth
Is the end of the world
And I could really care less

City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to careeeeee

[Part 3: I don't care]

I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
[x4]

I don't careeeeeeeeee

Everyone is so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the middle east
We are the stories and disciples
Of the Jesus of suburbia
Land of make believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make believe
And I don't believe
And I don't care!
I don't care! [x4]

[Part 4: Dearly beloved]

Dearly beloved are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure
Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

[Part 5: Tales of another broken home]

To live and not to breathe
Is to die In tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist

So I run
I run away
To the light of masochist
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time

I don't feel any shame
I won't apologize

When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain
When you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home

You're leaving...
You're leaving...
You're leaving...
Ah you're leaving home..."

i wish i could stop these thoughts. to have something to distract myself. i want you. i know that one moment with you could heal every ounce of this pain. but here i sit alone, forgotten. i'm so easy to dismiss. hard to remember, easy to forget. everyone i love forgets so easy. i dont want to be numb but i dont know how to deal with this again. i know that this is is. this is where it ends. im sorry. why am i so easy to cast aside? i wish i could do something to make u love me, really love me. i pray that this feeling will go away but somehow i know it wont. 

i find myself searching for the words to say. im sorry that it has to end this way. i'll never forget the moments we had. but i cant live life feeling this bad. i tried to be the good girl who did it all right. but that didnt work im still empty at night. i wish you could see the pain i feel. this is a nightmare but this time it's real. it begins to spiral, i know im lost. and yet i still know you're not the cause. i may never know how this came to be. i leave this at its end and im left with only me. 

not who i was but what's who i want to be? is this really true? am i happy? some days it's hard and i sit and cry. i try to live but still want to die. what do i matter? there is no worth, just a hollow corpse that walks this earth. doomed to spend eternity locked in my cage of uncertainty. thriving on chaos but never life. time spent alone with fists clenched tight. if i never love i'll never lose in this game where all the players are fools. a shatter, its gone but what do i care? just the loss of a life that was never even there. 

it came so quickly, lack of feeling, when i prayed for salvation. emptiness but still thoughts reeling. i'll never be the same again. all my days spent in darkness, praying for the light i seek. never knowing happiness, trapped inside a shell so weak. i sit to watch the days go on but time is meaningless now. able only to continue and still never knowing how"

just another thought....

Dear Mr. President
Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people and
You're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep
What do you feel when you look in the mirror
Are you proud

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye
How do you walk with your head held high
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why

Dear Mr. President
Were you a lonely boy
Are you a lonely boy
Are you a lonely boy
How can you say
No child is left behind
We're not dumb and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye
How do you walk with your head held high
Can you even look me in the eye

Let me tell you bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
Oh

How do you sleep at night
How do you walk with your head held high
Dear Mr. President
You'd never take a walk with me
Would you"

why do you push me away?
if you knew just what is in my heart only for you
maybe then you would see 

i've waited here for you, never dreamed that you were real
i've spent my life dreaming away
now i've found something so pure something so real
i can't let you walk away

everything in your heart i have seen. 
everything in your mind has been there with me
i know your sould i've searched your heart and now
i can see you but will you ever see me?

there is so much i want to say so much much i need to tell you 
but i am so afraid and but i know that it's just you
i've never been this way never felt this need
this need to be so honest and love so deeply

love a feeling inside i can't deny and still it scares me
love so intimidating so far and yet it's right in front of me
and again i want to run. i need to hide from this
but i cannot turn away this time can't fight what burns inside

i cried for you and you could see but turned away and im sorry 
i brought this out i didn't mean to let it show this isn't me
im not perfect but im in love and i'll try my best to for you
all i'm not and all you deserve but until i can i write this verse

another line just like the last another moment in the past
another tear i will not shed another drop but this time red
i can't believe i'm back to this back to the home i didn't miss
back to scars instead of tears and back to minutes lapsed to years

i wish i could be strong for you, i know that this will never do
i try to be strong and mask what's inside but infront of you i cannot hide
i cannot lie and so i write and hope that this will take the fight
know i love you til the end which may just be around the bend

even as i die my love lives on"

there has been alot on my mind lately that i havnt been able to put into words. idk maybe the sickness is good for something... i've had time to think

no words can describe these feelings inside. my heart races my mind stops 
there is a part of me i never knew was still alive. i thought i died. 
you brought me back and saved me you have no idea what you made me
you told me who i was and made me remember myself 
i was so lost but you found me and lead me home, you are my home
in you i'm safe and comfortable, im finally myself
no words can describe the song in my heart
there are no words just a melody. 
a song resonating from my soul to fill the air around me
a song of love and peace and home 
a song of happiness no longer sung alone"

recently i met someone who understands me and can relate to where i've been and where im going. i have never... ever(!) had this much in common with another person and its really wierd. i can already feel emotions starting to bubble under the surface even though it hasnt been very long and its so strange.

the whole situation right now in my life is kinda crazy and hectic and stuff but i feel like right here, right now i'm exactly where i need to be. i feel like the recent bullshit events lately have been leading up to this and i think i finally found what i've been searching for so long to find. 

i find my self desperately trying not to get attached but it doesnt seem to be working too well. i think that for the first time i'm just gunna let go and give in and just see what happens.... wish me luck"

There are alot of things that i dont know, i dont really know exactly what i want right now but i do know that it's not this. I have been trying so hard lately to change and to improve my life, myself. 

there has been alot going on lately i need to take some time to back away and just get a better perspecitive on things. i probably wont be doing much posting for a little bit and will probably disappear for a few days. i think friday night i'll head up to the mountains with the guys and spend the weekend out in the middle of nowhere, i think it will do me some good.

"event","well its 3am and for some reason i find thoughts of you swimming through my head. i dont even know you that well but i cant seem to get u out of my head sometimes... its so wierd. i never find myself caring about someone or really even giving a shit but you i dunno i guess u just found a way to get to me. i lay in bed at night and wishing u were next to me. i dont know if its infatuation or that i genuinely like u. sometimes i wonder. i cant help but think its something more than mere amusement.

from the first time i talked to you i knew there was somethin special about u. there have never been many people who could evoke much interest from me but for an odd unexplainable reason u have. maybe it's the fact that i know i cant be with you. maybe i'm over thinking this. i wonder if you think about me this way. i usually tend to want what i cant have. you remind me of myself in so many ways that i cant believe i found someone like u (or rather somewhat like me lol) 

i almost wish that i could forget the time we spent together. as insignificant as it might have seem it actually meant something. i think of u & an image of ur smile comes into my head. its a great memory. lol ya kno im writting this and i almost feel crazy. lol its actually pretty funny to me. oh well anough for tonight"

all the recent talk of valentines day has actually had me a bit bummed. lee called me and asked me for my address the other day because he wanted to send me a package of v-day things... im still not sure exactly what but i changed the subject and then said i had to go. Dustin now appears to be smitten with me (oh yes, i said smitten lol) and wants to take me out to dinner but i said that i have a huge paper due the next day (which isnt entirely true) so i said i wouldnt be able to go out that night. I've been thinking and there is really only one person that i want to go out with for v-day. It seems that i always go for the guy i cant have. 

i have also been thinking lately about my mother alot lately. i always thought that i never wanted to be anything like her but i realize that i am more like her than i realized before. i hate to think that i wanted anything but to be like her, regardless of all the mistakes she might have made she was a good mother nonetheless. i dont want to blame her (i hate the whole blame the parents cliche) but i have realized that alot of my psych problems come from her & my father. i think that part of why i dont let ppl get close to me is attributed to them. but we'll talk about that another day, i cant think about it anymore tonight.

with the recent thoughts of all the craziness and bullshit i have discovered somthing. i always thought that my family was never really much of a family (at least not to me because of the age gap) i realize now that i had the best family in the world all along. i have always said that my friends are like my family but now im starting to think they are not like my family, they are my family. i realized tonight that if i ever had a real emergency that there are always 2 ppl that i can call and i know.. really know that they would do anything they possibly could for me. if that's not family i dunno what is. 

i also realized today how much a simple comment from someone can mean. i saw an old friend from high school today and he made an offhand remark about how (even tho i was in pjs & no makeup) i looked great & stuff. even if he was just sayin it to be nice it was really nice to hear someone say that. its funny yo me how one small little comment can overpower all the negative thats been goin on lately. thanks brandon, it meant alot :)"

"event","i feel as if im wandering in a land of perpetual darkness. all of this seems like a dream. it doesnt seem real, it cant be real. i cant stand how things have turned out. i'd give anything to go back and start over again. everyone else seems to be able to get it together but i cant. i cant seem to let myself have what i want. i've always been so proud of the things ive been through and that i made it through ok... but i didnt. im not ok. there it is, i admit it.

i try so hard to be everything and have ended up with nothing. i've pushed everyone who ever really cared so far away. i wish i could just get in my car & drive away. get so far away from here. i wish i could run away to somewhere nobody knows me, get a job, a place, a whole new life. i want to start all over. i hate that i feel like this. the mere fact that i have these thoughts seems so wrong. 

i found what i thought i always wanted, turns out its not for me. then i found what i never thought i wanted, that was perfection... but things change. now i know what i want but i cant seem to find it or when i do i cant go after it. i cant seem to jump off that ledge im still too tied down to the future i dont want. it sounds rediculous, i know. i cant stand the life im living or what my future seems to hold but i cant change. i try so hard but things never seem to change.

maybe there is more wrong with me than i have ever realized."

"event","i find myself falling back into old habits again. im not even sure why i do it. i hate who i was and who i am once again becoming. i thought that i moved past this but i guess that due to recent changes in my life i have gone back. i hate that i feel like i need to be vague on here. 

i dont feel like i can really talk about any of this. im not the good person everyone thinks i am. i actually think that im a bad person and im just good at hiding it. i got drunk last night and started thinking about things and now i dont know. i have a few options, all of which have their problems...

a. i go back to how things were before i left memphis. so im not completely happy but there is a sense of security and life would be stable. everyone would be happy

b. i jump off the ledge, take a chance, and risk my heart for happiness. 

c. i walk away from everything. 

i find it easier to avoid problems lately and find other things to take their place in my mind. i try to keep my head up but lately my mind keeps coming back to the same thoughts. why would i make decisions like this? why am i so self destructive?"

me & heather road tripped up to nashville saturday to see solvi, 100 watt opera & brother in arms... it was sooooo much fun

ive been thinking about you lately.. about us. what us? lol ets avoid that subject... ive gotten good at just avoiding things and well ignoring everything. ive been thinking that maybe if things had been different if we wouldve worked. i sometimes still think that you are the one im meant to be with. the signs have been present, fate tried to tell me. i think that one of these days im gunna be happy and things will be good and that's when you'll come back. it always happens like that. do you just enjoy what u put me through? *sigh*

there has been so much going on lately with this whole idea of relationships. i dont think it's for me. i really sometimes think that im not meant to be ina 'relationship'. sometimes i feel like that's what i want, i want one person, i want to say i love you and mean it, to see their face and smile. the problem is, i cant find a person who makes me want that.. not the way you did. ya know i sit and think about it now and im not even sure why i thought u were so great. dont get me wrong, i love you, but i dunno. you changed, you're not the person that i fell in love with...

ive had a new distraction lately... well, somewhat. im sot really sure if its a good thing or not. my old distractions are still there but somehow have been...surpassed by this new one.... good lord ive lost my mind. and there there is the whole thing that isnt a distraction.. its my life and its what i should want......should

i often find myself asking why it is that i dont seem to want the things other people want. i feel like im restless and can never allow myself to be happy. what's wrong with me? really... 

the past few weeks ive seriously thought about going back into therapy.. i think that maybe it could help. i dunno maybe having someone to talk to and to get a new perspective on things would really help. in fact i know it would..... oh well. one of these days i'll get my life striaghtened out.... appearently its just not today...

"event","loving the right person at the wrong time, having the wrong person when the time is right- and finding out you love someone right after that person walks out of your life... sometimes you think you're already over a person, but when you see them smile at you, you'll suddenly realize that you're just pretending to be over them just to ease the pain of knowing that they will never be yours again... in my opinion, some are afraid to see the one they thought they loved being held by someone else. most relationships tend to fail not because the absence of love (love is always present) it's just that one was being loved too much and the other was being loved too little. as we all know that the heart is the center of the body but it beats on the left. maybe that's the reason why the heart is not always right? most often we fall in love with the person we think we love but to only discover that for them we are just passing time. while the one who truly loves us remains either a friend or a stranger...

so here's a piece of advice;

let go when you're hurting too much.
give up when love isn't enough.
and move on when things are not like before.


ok so the past few days have been crazy (sorry if it seems like im ignoring some people) but i'll write about it tommorrow.... now is sleepy time.... and i *really* want a shower!!!!! :) night kids! & happy new year!"

i wish i could just stay here. i dont really know how im gunna live there for another 4 months. i sounds like such a short time but it feels like eternity. ive met some cool people out there (dave & micheal and trey and stuff) but i just cant do it. but im not gunna swell on that. when my mother calls me a failure its bad enough. 

i have gotten to see alot of the old homies since i've been home. i got to meet some new ones too! it's been rather exciting. i know that when i go back to knoxville im gunna be all bored again and sittin in my dorm never doing anything.... omg im gunna die. im gunna fuckin go stir crazy. i think im startin to go a little nutty just thinkin about it but i know that it's gunna happen. 

whew! *breathe* so anyway. i really do love bein home tho. i can honestly say that many things have changed around here but i hope that it's all for the best. god bless my little party whores are growin up! lol its kinda funny but all the people i use to go out & get so incredibly fucked up with have gone straight or sumthin. i love those kids tho.

"event","on my own again, lost in the darkness
all alone again, lost in my head 
and i know now who you are
i cant believe i ever fell for this

i cant believe i was so weak, cant believe u brought this out in me 
i know you never cared, i only thought u were there
why play these games, and trick my heart?
why run away when we're so far apart?
i dont understand, how u get to me again.

there was a time i thought you were everything i ever wanted
now i know its you who's everything i didnt need
i cant take this pain, this questioning
i wont go through it again, im sorry

ive become addicted to this pain
ive become a shell without a name
i lived for you, id die for you
i hate myself, because of you
i wish i could just walk away this time
i wish i could find the strength to end this lie
i know you see, and i know you hear
and i see you continue on without a care

i've shed my tears through all these years
gave my life away, to be with you another day
my one regret, my biggest mistake, my greatest love and my tortured hate
the best and worst in me is you, my sweetest pain and love so true
i back away

i know its time, to end these rhymes
this cant be life, i wont live this way
i know its time, to continue my life 
i wont be this, no, not again

im sorry my friend, but this is the end
i wont stick around, just to be let down again
so i say goodbye, wish u a happy life
i still believe in you, but this is what i have to do
so just know this, i will always love you
but remember that i will never go back"

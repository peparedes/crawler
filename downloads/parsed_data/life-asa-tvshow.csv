But one of these days if you haven't already you'll see it.<br /><br />I want to raise acne awareness (I know it I'm making it sound like a disease...but in a way it kind of is) If you know someone (besides me) that has acne tell them they're beautiful! Look past it and see their beauty within, because it's UNBELIEVABLLY hard to feel beautiful when your face is has<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""> red </span>as a stop sign.<br /><br /><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"">Dos and Don'ts</span><br /><br />Do- Complement them on their other features. (eyes, smile, etc.)<br /><br />Don't- Say: ""Oh, I have acne too!"" unless you REALLY do because that will just make them feel so much worse.<br /><br />Don't- Ask ""Are you doing anything for your acne?"" This always upsets me because I'm doing EVERYTHING.<br /><br />So remember...make a friend with acne today!! haha<br /><br />I dedicate this blog to Alexis: ""It's hard to face the problem when the problem is your face!"" Proavtiv didn't work for meeeee.<br /><br />I love you girl! You're beautiful in everyway!!<br /><br /><font size=""2"">Please know I'm not fishing for compliments...<br /> I'm just being honest.<br /> <br /> It's mainly for other people...just to let them know I understand.</font><br /><br />-Amanda<br /></div>"

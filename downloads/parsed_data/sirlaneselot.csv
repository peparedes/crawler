"event","A while back, about a year I'm guessing, someone I knew quite well asked me why I never let them in, or talked about my most pressing and questionable spiritual issues...and I can't remember what I told them, but lately I've been thinking about it again.  It's not that I don't trust people, well that's part of it, mostly it's the fact that I'm afraid of my own doubt, as Pedro the Lion says ""I could tell you why I doubt it, and why I still believe"".  I am afraid of my own faith whenever it does not consume me.  When you swim on a warm day in the ocean, the waves come, and the waves go, but that wet in between is cold and alone, with only you, the sky, and the seagulls.  Maybe why that's why I partially don't delve deeper into my faith sometimes...because I'm afraid of what limits I might find, what battles I may witness whereby my voice even with the filthy liars I've encountered, that even those I care about will be turned away.  So often though I'm conflicted in what I find because I always see two sides of everything even if I refuse to admit it.  

A song my mother always said that reminded her of me, many times...and considering how restless of a spirit I am it can be rather fitting





I have searched the whole world over,
Looking for the things I thought would
fill my heart and ease my pain
I can climb the highest mountain,
Or sail beyond the seas,
And it always brings me back to you again.

It's amazing how you love me;
It's amazing how you care,
It's amazing how you're always thinking of me
All the time, everywhere.

There are times when I feel lonely and twisted up inside
On who I am, what I want to be
There's a yearning deep inside me, and a longing to be free
And it always brings me back to you again.

It's amazing how you love me;
It's amazing how you care,
It's amazing how you're always thinking of me
All the time, everywhere.

I have lived my life an outlaw on the run
Leaving broken hearted dreams for everyone
No matter what I do and no matter what I've done,
It always brings me back to you again.

I can look the whole world over thinking that I'll find
Another one who'll know me like you do;
But no matter where I go and no matter where I search,
It'll always bring me back to you again."

"event","To be human is to be so fragile sometimes.  I was reading about psychology the other day off an overhead, that humans are strange creatures and how they could survive the horrors of concentration camps, but a slight word from a loved one can send you to a lifetime of trauma.  It's really not much fun to be both, mind you I've never been through something even close to concentration camps, or any real violence.  But I totally get where they're coming from.  You drop the cloak over yourself...you begin to doubt...because you don't know if you've even had silk or steel wool pulled over your eyes.  It all becomes blank and you feel like novacaine again too afraid to actually examine myself in detail and seriously not trusting pretty much everyone.  This whole city...I don't know.  I swear I could be living in medicine hat and not really notice it seems.  Although all these straight streets are kind of heart warming.  How does one begin to trust again when I haven't sorted out what originally got me here in the first place?  I guess you end up accepting that people will never know their actions, I myself am the same.  I wish I knew, but I know it's useless in that it probably only matters to me.  That's the whole funny thing about it, I haven't really thought about it in a while, but as usual I don't care what happened, I just want to know how it all it happened, and at least that way I can learn.  Antique maps are beautiful for their artistry and innacuracy...that naivity in the chase, that conquest of gold and little squiggly lines on parchment paper.  It was the Stan Rogers lines ""Seeking Gold and glory, at the call of many men, to find the road back home again..."".  Maybe every man needs his northwest passage, at least the restless ones...and maybe my northwest passage, at least the first part of the voyage is actually admitting there are maggots in your sea cakes and that basically the hull is broken.  It's a thing that needs to start every morning and go every day until I break from loving exhaustion I guess.  The past is..."

"event","Have you ever felt like a ghost?   As if what you touched wasn't real, and couldn't be touched.  You seem to watch everything float by you like a warm glycerine topped ocean, shiny, thick, and unsubstantive.  You realize how immersed you've become in the process of not being immersed.  I don't even know if I've forgotten what I'm still so afaid of."

Funny things I remember:  Circle K winter social

   I've always been impressed by people who go all out to surprise someone, it not only gives you that warm feeling, but it's fun to do for the other person as well.  This year, as supposedly every year, circle k had a winter social and a secret santa to go with it.  So, on that saturday I went christmas shopping (my dad wanted 6-8 bottles of Austraulian red wine) I got my mother a book, and found Nick my Secret Santa candidate, a small rubber frog and a german knight figurine (his alter-ego.  I then took my presents to city centre where I knew Anastasia would be, hence I could get my presents gift wrapped and leave a nice donation as well.  From there I went straight to the party since I found out there would be no swimming and I was already running late.  After seemingly stalking catherine on the lrt and the bus, I got up to the party and wound up stripping down a couple of small cooked chickens for a stir fry.  For some reason people were giving me wierd looks, I mean it's not like I could have saved the small bits for soup anyways, and I was under time contraints....seriously it was just meat.  After a bit of pool playing, sand involved curling/shuffle board we had a delightful meal of ...food...including stuffing.  Eventually however it was time to open gifts for secret santa, and lo and behold I had left mine at the gift wrap so nick ended up waiting a little longer then he should have originally.  As a premptive strike to this conversation: for my secret santa I had asked for socks, preferably with peppers on them.  Well, I was in for a surprise to say the least.  I got my bag, expecting a pair or two of socks.  Well...let's just say there's a good 12 pairs each with little pieces of paper stapled to them with pictures of peppers and other pepper paraphanalia and a pair of frilly lacey blue socks which definitely don't fit me as you'll see in pictures on the website.

"event","Garth Brooks maybe callin' Baton Rouge as a trucker, I however went out tonight to an event with subs and students from Lousiana Tech which happens to be in Alexandria I believe.  I met some interesting people that said ""y'all"" which we replaced with ""you guys"" , and then got a ride home with Maria who was on her way to St. Albert which was really nice, although I wish the ride was longer...she really did make for interesting conversation.  The most moving part of the evening however came during our seminars/talking sessions which were jovial and informal, but moving nonetheless.  Basically we went through healthy christian relationships...and the nature of forgiveness.  We also discussed that sometimes telling the person the sin and asking for forgiveness is not always a positive thing.  And I knew that I had a few people to forgive myself...and just to be blunt and just write it out and maybe deal with it, as I generally don't deal with events that happen to me until months or years afterwards.  I also need to forgive myself for some things as well...and just let go, and finally give myself to God, and not to my obsessions with justice, attention, and my own insular world.  Comedy and nervousness are symptoms and results of pain...and in my case detachment.  I want to live again...or maybe for the first time."

"event","Maybe for once I'm going to be dead candid about some things...and besides my moving and all...meh, who's going to read this anyway.  I realized in the past two weeks that I can accomplish much, but I need to branch out and think and do at the same time.  I've also realized that I'm not ready for a romantic relationship anytime soon.  Even with the opportunity presenting itself to me, with someone who any other point in my life I probably would have jumped at the chance.  It's not everyday you find someone so similar to yourself who seems to bring a sense of life and adventure back to you after months of festering.  Hell, I feel free to dance around again...as long as I don't think about money or summer.  I swear that I'm going to go and change my cell phone ring once I actually get it set up and all so I don't start shaking when I hear it.  But I also know that I'm not happy with who I am right now and that my focus should be on growth and not following my desires.  That's why I'm trying to avoid relationships as well, because I just would be vacant in them, still with camped up feelings.  When I'm ready to date again...I'm sure I will...but now is time for growth.  It also would be totally unfair to any girl considering I'm not happy with myself and therefore would be totally unhelpful and insensitive to anyone else right now.  I've got a lot of growing to do, many years of pain and experience to flush out.  I want to feel again...and until that happens...some things I'm going to keep out of other peoples hands.
       The whole roommate situation has been great as well.  Ali's really been bringing out a lot of good in me.  I find her certainly easy to amuse, but she also reminds me so often where I came from...and that I know that loneliness...and that there's nothing wrong with being wierd and crazy...or most likely ADD in my case.  The idea of having more liquor stores then city blocks to the west of me is rather strange...really one should be enough...ah gorgeous economics.  It's fun to feel like I can dance again.
    Trying to explain my whole situation to someone else however gets to be kind of strange.  Ross is a good spring board for such things.  As Ross tried to comprehend himself and put it back to me like this...""Ok, so you got dumped a while back from a long distance relationship, and now you're moving in with your ex's friend and co-worker, and the person whose apartment you're taking belongs to another one of her ex's?""  Greg: ""Basically yes, it's not like I planned it that way"".  I admittedly was worried moving up here for that reason.  Despite the fact that most of my friends laughed at the idea of me being some sort of stalker, it seemed to develop a few believers out here.  The comment ""a knife up against her throat"" from Nicole (d) is still burned in my mind.  I've had a stalker it's not fun, but for some reason that comment stung like nothing else I could have imagined.  It was baseless and still gets to me today and another comment about me changing my dreams for others...something like that.  That comment however was the whole reason I almost didn't move in with Ali, one of those things that really got to me somehow.

      Reputation, in my ramblings here is another one of those things that sometimes gets to me, but otherwise just makes me laugh.  First, in many ways I can be a really introverted person, so having a reputation is something I often taken seriously.  I'm generally used to having a fairly mellow reputation most often associated with brains, hair, or just hyper storytelling...otherwise I'm fairly cautious.  Thus, my experience in Edmonton, whethere people have heard good or bad things about me.  The wierd one was the rumour that I had been some sort heartbreaking player in Maple Ridge in the last 6 months...couldn't figure that one out..perhaps it was my alter-ego.  


I'm also at a cross roads...or running room of faith...trying to grow and not run away from my problems anymore...my dreams have been strange...if you've been in them...I'm sorry...I do like living here, but it's late and tommorow I'm going to go find myself a job.

Toodles to the world"

It was not only funny and entertaining but challenging as well, but that was just personally for me. But anyway, that's the point of this entry, I love the movie Hitch!!!

"event","Why's love so complicated? It's really a simple concept, you care for someone more than you care for yourself, you put another before yourself. How did we make it so complicated? WHy can't I just love somone and leave it at that, nothing else, no other feelings or emotions? Also, why isn't that satisfying? I hate human nature! (Actually I don't, I rather think it's a good thing, but right now I hate it) See I basically know all the answers to the aforementioned, except how we complicated the concept of love so much, that I can't get my mind around.

Plus, I've been in kinda a sad spot since Anna's party/secret santa it was an ok party, but it just got kinda depressing and then I kinda just sat there thinking, and I did what I usually do when I get that way, I thought of every single one of my insecurities and regrets and painful memories. It was nearly hell for 30 mintues, and then Anna kinda cracked my shell, she wouldn't leave me alone til I told her what was wrong, and I wasn't as sad for the rest of the night, so thanx go out to Anna.

Oh, and finally, I miss my friends, I didn't see many of them today, and it made me sad. :'-(

The Steelers suck Yankee dick!
George Bush is a horrible president and should not be re-elected.
In all honesty John Kerry isn't a much better option for president, but at least if he's elected, Bush won't be president.
I hate Rush Limbaugh. Adam listens to him incessently. Adam is really pissing me off right now.

Flaming Liberal, Flaming Liberal, Flaming Liberal....blah blah blah blah blah

I never said I was a flaming liberal and why are liberals flaming? huh?

A vote for Kerry is a vote for Bin Laden, is Rush a fucking idiot?! I am not going to vote for Bin Laden!!! this fucker is trying to tell me who I'm gonna vote for?!!! What a fucka!!!! I would never ""vote"" for Bin Laden he is a mass murderer of American people. I will vote for Kerry and not really because I like Kerry but because I can't imagine living under ""King George"" for another 4 years.

This brings me to another point. The electoral college is a mess. It must be removed!! Why should I vote if I'm not in a ""swing state""? why should one state's votes count more than another's? This devalues the votes of people who live in ""non-swing"" states.

And I have to say I am in favor of stem cell research. I think that <i>discarded</i> and <i>nonliving</i> embryos should most certainly be used to help living people. I'm sick of listening to people whine about the rights of unborn children. Half the time they're refering to fucking embryos. How bout the rights of living people. that's one thing I hated about the catholic doctrine we went over in morality class, ""the"" Church holds the position that the unborn child's life is more important than the mother's. Now that's fucked up!

Iraq, Afghanistan, and the war on terror is not the only issue in this election. Rush doesn't seem to get that.

Whatever, I'm done ranting for now.

And yes I am voting for Kerry tomorrow!"

"event","So ya, Last night was ok. Lina, ""Toree"", Tiff, and I went bowling. Then we went back to Lina's and had pizza and watched Aladdin! It was all fun and good, and I was actually able to distract myself for most of the night. Then Tiff started talking bout ""me and Em"" this and ""Em and I"" that and it was mostly downhill from there. FOr one thing I had to say goodbye to Lina at the end of the night. It was horrible, I felt terrible afterwards. Like I have another black hole in my chest now. Ya I know she's not gone fer like ever, but it's just something like I mean it felt like I was saying goodbye forever. I'm gonna miss her, she's been such a part of my life, she helped make me the man I am today. SHe always listened to me and stuff. And I can't help it, I love her. I love her in every way a person can. And since I'm guessing you'll be reading this, you're amazing Lina, I'll never forget you. 

So, now that I'm nearly crying, I'll try to talk about my latest sadness, Emily. She came right out and gave me an answer: she wants to be single for awhile. I mean you're not my type I could handle. But Em's response I don't know what to do with. I mean I could do what I first felt like doing which is wait for her, as long as it takes. Or I could try to forget about her, which I don't think I can do. I mean I don't wanna forget about her, she's a great friend, and an amazing person, I don't think I could forget about her. 

So, what am I to do, this is my open question to anyone who might read this, I need opinions, insights, musings, insane rants, anything. Boy with hopeless crush, please help!

So that's my rant fer now. I hope this pain ends soon.

"event","Yup, I'm back from ND. It was great. Amanda's leadership wasn't that good, but I got to know Emily better. 
My god, Emily...she's amazing. She's intelligent, caring, honest, and has a good sense of humor. god I love those eyes, and that smile. she's amazing, wait I already said that. whatever.
now I think I've got myself a new crush, but I'm not sure. and to add onto this, she's dan's girlfriend. Which sucks, cuz Dan and I are real tight right now. And even if we weren't, I'm not gonna go after another guy's girl. But then there's the observation that dan and emily don't treat each other like boyfriend and girlfriend and are prolly only together because it's comfortable and safe. I don't know, I just know that after being with her in ND for a week, I slept over at her house last night and we went to church together this morning, it was my best night and morning ever. And no matter what I might feel, right now I can't wait to see her again. I want to spend all the time I have left with her, but I can't. 
of course I haven't outright told either dan or emily about my possible feelings, cuz I'm not sure myself. I just know that I'd do anything for this girl right now, including ignoring my feelings, and that's both scary and exciting.
So yup, that's my life right now, waiting til I can see Em again.

Robin says she has an issue with me being a college freshman and her being a HS sophmore, whatever. I mean all it really could have been was me showing up at her science fair. But see I was just tryin' to be a good friend, you know support her in what she's interested in. But apparently that means I'm like a stalker or something, whatever. 

I finally got to talk to Lina last night. We had a nice conversation, and I wish I hadn't been getting kinda yelled at to play host to my guests, cuz I was having fun talkin' with her. It was just really relaxing, I don't know why, I was able to be honest, I guess. It just relieved a lotta tension and I kinda needed that.

So Matt was here for the weekend, well he's still here, at least til ten tomorrow morning. So we had fun this weekend. A lotta talkin, a lotta catchin' up, a lotta laughin'. It was fun, we had some times with some friends, namely Nick, Matt, Krista, and Jess. I had another person tell me that my eyes are beautiful. She also told me that she thinks I look better with shaggy hair than with the short, near-buzz that I've got right now. So I guess I'm lettin' it grow.

So ya, Troy keep's talkin' bout Diana. ARGH!!!!!!!!!!! I don't think he understands how hard it is for me to listen to it all the time. He couldn't, he's always had a girlfriend, he just goes from one to another. I've never had a girlfriend, never. I've never had someone to put my arm around, never had someone to kiss, never had someone to just, for lack of a better word, cuddle with. It hurts, alot. Now, I know I'm bitchin' alot here, but, ya, I don't have an excuse, whatever. Now you may tell me, why do you need a girlfriend, I don't know, I don't know if I need a girlfriend, but I want one. I'm sick of being just a friend to every girl I know, it gets fucking irritating, especially when they're like 'I Love You Ryan', which I'm sure they do, and I love them to, in that friend way, but it's just kinda upsetting. whatever, I'll stop bitching now.

Me: ""I'm every girl I know's friend...""
Troy: ""Well then don't be friends first!"""

"event","So ya, lot's happened in my life since I last wrote in this. But skipping to today before going back. I finally got switchfoot today, yay, me likes. Then, going back in time, last night/yesterday, I went to Krista's grad party, it was at the fish and game club. I got to sit and talk with rebbecah, i think it's spelled that way. Well anyways, the talking with rebbecah was really fun. Then a group of us went out on a boat ride around the lake, and I realized that it was the laek Matt used to live on. I got to see the island that we used to explore, man I know like every inch of that island, there's really tasty blueberries on one side, and then there's a hill and it's basically a cliff on one side, and then the other side is like a beach, kinda. But ya, so I also got to see his house, the dock, and the boat. It was so many memories, oh man, it was great, and sad at the same time. I almost started crying. and Becki was all like, don't be sad, and that made me madder cuz I was like, just give me this, please!!! I mean people can't be happy all the time, and being sad doesn't neccessarilly mean depression. aaahhh!!! whatever, I'm over it. moving on, I had more fun with rebbecah, and then we had to leave, and then peps came to my house and we hung out and I was kinda bored cuz rebbecah wasn't there, and neither were any of my other cool fri-ends like Lina or Tori or anybody else that I could like had fun hangin' with. so ya, before that, I can't remember, there was something about nick and beer, but anythign about nick right now, is automatically about beer too, I think he's an alcholic, but whatever. so ya that's basically my life, oh wait, ya when I was at Krista's party one of the little girls had a penguin stuffed animal, and I was like, awww, Lina! but ya, then I met this totally cool little dude, graham. ya so that's what's been happenin' to me, other then a new obsession with CSI, but ya. ok I'm ending this now.

Peace, Love, and Great Sex, (hehe)

BUt whatever, I think I'll try for a larger post tommorrow, cuz I'm really tired right now, but whatever. Cuz there's alot to tell, Nick and Krista seem to have made up, for one. and somethings wrong with Andrea, but Robin's not allowed to tell me, I guess I'll find out when I call her tomorrow. I also saw matt's old house today, much sadness, memories and near-crying, but whatever, it will all be discussed tommorrow.

"event","Yup, so I've really got nothing else to do...well except go to sleep, which I really should...but I don't wanna! hehe ok moving on............<thinking>.............yup, life kinda sucks right now. I'm getting yelled at again, all the time. and when my rents aren't yelling at me they're yelling at my bros around me. it gets reall annoying and aggravating after a while!

Oh, wait, I just remembered some good news!!! My one, only, and best friend from 1st grade up until freshman year, Matt Bradley, is gonna be in town the weekend of June 26th! I haven't seen him in three years! Man I can't wait, I hope my parents will let him stay at the house, cuz I we won't sleep an hour all weekend! it'll be great! oh ya, that also means I can't do anything with mis amigos on that weekend, unless you don't mind Matt tagging along. So anywho, back to more local, and more depressing, stuff.

I dislike girls!! I'm still having girl problems, I think I will be until I die! I'm still attracted to girls that I can't be with. Usually it's because they have a boyfriend. Some guys don't care about that, but I guess I do, cuz I don't go there. It's just really frustrating. And I really didn't need Missy groping me the other night. Now I guess most guys wouldn't mind that, but I look at missy and she's so fucking superficial, and I know it's because she's very self-concious, and I wish I could help her but ya, I don't know. The whole thing just threw me for a loop, and I really didn't need that right now. 

Also, I haven't been projecting my best self recently, I don't know why, my actions just haven't been on par with my normal behavior patterns. and, no, I'm not talking about wanting to get drunk, I'm talking about the fact that I seem to be pissing some people off, I don't know what it is that I'm doing or maybe I do, I don't know.

But ya, I'm gonna wrap up the pity-ryan routine tonight because it's getting really pathetic.

"event","Life smells kinda rank right now. I had kinda a bad night last night. Nick came over to get drunk, I mean he came over with the intention of getting crunk. And that's all he wanted to do. So we sat around in troy's room and watched american wedding while nick and troy got drunk on the beer that nick had. I tried to, cuz i really needed to get drunk last night, but no, I found out that I hate beer, I don't like it. I'd much rather have rum and coke, or whatever that was that tori let me have a sip of. so anyways, they got drunk and smoked out on the roof. then the movie was over so we went out to the outdoor fireplace and had s'mores. Then nick had to leave and troy had to go to bed. so I stayed at the fire. I sat there and listened to music, and watched the fire, and thought. I thought of how alone I felt, I remember thinking, I wish someone was here, and I remember thinking, I need a hug, and then crying. BUt anyways, I also thought of my late grandma and many other things, like what's the difference between liking someone, loving someone, and lusting after someone? it's all very confusing and headachy. so then, after a nice think, a nice cry, and the fire going out, I went inside and stayed up watching a movie for the next 2 hours, so I didn't wake up today until about 20 minutes ago. Life smells sometimes, and it smells rank!

Ya so fer the last few minutes I stuck my head out the window and watched the sun rise and the birds doing their birdy thing. It was so cool. I've never felt so alive. I could smell some burnt firewood, and I coul dhear the birds making bird noises and the rising sun was amazing. It was just wonderful, and I never would have experienced it if Tori hadn't dared me to stay up until 6 am. It was so great. But now I really have to go and get some type of sleep. so bye bye kiddies.

"event","Wow this will make three updates in one night, a personal record. What a way to start off this new journal, eh? I was just thinking about this and needed to write about it. So here goes...

Sometimes when I'm with my friends, except for Pursuit, but that's over, I don't always feel at home, I feel like I'm not completely a part of the group. Maybe it's cuz I went to Xaverian and most of my friends went to WHS, I don't know. But like I look at a lot of my friends and think, I really should be with the sci-fi geeks or whatnot. I don't know. It's not that I don't like spending time with my friends, I love it. I just sometimes get this nagging feeling that I'm not entirely in the loop or whatnot. It's kinda like I'm hanging out with people far cooler then I am. I don't know, it's just that like alot of my friends follow these different punk bands, I think it is, The Cadence and others that I don't know. See like that's the thing I don't know em, cuz I don't listen to em. So sometimes I feel like I don't belong, but whatever. Also, I've got one last bone to pick, I don't really like some of the members of one of these bands. I don't especially like Russ or Ryan. I mean I don't hate em or anything, I just don't really enjoy myself when they're around. I don't know, maybe it's the whole LIna connection thing, I mean that did set me against Russ from the start, but I don't know, I mean that's part of the reason I don't like Adam, but I also just can't stand him as a person, but whatever. Talking about not liking people is starting to make me not like myself, I shouldn't not like people like this, I mean I'm gonna disagree with people, but I've been going on here for a while about this when I just need to stop. Ok I'm done. The catharsis is over. Hey look, the sun is kinda coming up, well it's getting light out at least. It's funny, but since I met Tori I think I've stayed up past 4 am a record number of times, hehe.

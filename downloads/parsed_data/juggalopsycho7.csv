"event","Ya Ya Ya Ya YA We made it 6 months this is so awesome....Me and mandi are madly in love with each other...I love her so much, i had the best weekend ever......lets see Friday night was my sister, Heather, well it was her birthday party and we all hang out and her b/f phil and her ex tim try to wrestle me, but as much as it pains me to say this, i won against two guys....... lol. Then, Saturday I went out with Heather and her dad for her birthday and we went to Play Putt-Putt and i think i won, then we went and got Italian Ice, then we went to White marsh and i saw Mandi there with her friends....I was so happy i love her so much and i got to see her.........ahhhhhhhhh the joy she brings to my life. Then, Sunday we went to church and i sat by  Mandi in sunday school, but she had to help with childrens church for the regular service. So, we all went to my house after church and hung out and i flirted with Mandi and kept askin her out but she wouldnt give me a straight answer so I got out some of the drawings i used to do and showed her them and i showed her my yearbooks from middle school....I used to be FUGLY......so we all got ready for the evening service which was gonna be the Water Baptism Service...... before that we went to taco bell it was good. So when we got to church mandi didnt sit with us at first cuz she had to do a drama with the youth, but after they were done she came over and sat next to me and with her fingers spelled yes on my leg and i was confused at first, but i asked her if that was to what i asked earlier and she said yes and i got MAD butterflies it was so awesome.....Then, Pastor Ed called all the men who were gettin baptized up onto the stage and we had to give a testimony, i was so nervous. But, as soon as the microphone was placed in my hand Jesus just came thru me and i knew exactly what to say. After we all gave our testimonies we all went to the baptism room and I volunteered to go first because no one else would and i was feeling very bold....Guys Jesus can do amazing things for you, believe me. After i came down the women were heading onto stage and my mom and heather gave their testimonies and i was soooooooo proud of them. Then they too got baptized it was a great time in my life....... After church a Mandi came over for a little while and we just hang out it was awesome . . . i made her puddin cuz i told her i was gonna make her somethin to eat and she said she wanted puddin. At first i was bein a smart allick and told her i was her puddin, but i eventually made it and i fed some to her and she fed some to me it was sooooo romantic. Now today is our six month wutever you wanna call it cuz it is not an anniversery so ill call it our six monthiverssary lol. I worked really hard on her present so i hope she likes it.  Well, I am gonna go now,Hopefully i can see my boo tonight.</a><!--

"event","wow guys today was insane. Well this morning i woke up with a hangover. my uncles wedding was last nite and i had a few drinks and did some dancin and got some numbers....lol.  yeah i caught the garter and had to put it on this girl heathers leg.(she had nice legs just ta let ya know) so yeah i was dancin and i know i had to be drunk cuz they said i did the worm and i cant do that due to certain things. but yeah i got home and passed out in my suit pants only across my bed/ my mom had to get me into my pajamas...lol...she stabbed me with my belt.  but, yeah  i woke up this mornin and went to my grandma's for lunch. So...RT calls me and says ""hey dude i just got my bike outta the impound you wanna come ridin"" and i am an exreme bmx'er so of course i said yes. so we get up there and he says ""my bike has 3000 dollars put into it to make it faster"" and i am like oh sure. so we start it up and i am feelin all ready and confident and i start to go and the bike lifts up out from under me. i was fine but yeah the bike kinda got hurt....lmao. so i give it a second try and i am doin okay and i forgot how to brake the bike and ran into a fence....but i didnt only run into it i rode up the freakin fence.....lol. The bike was literally at least 8ft in the air and landed on top of my leg. but i got caught on the barb wire a lil bit but i am fine. So yeah, after that mandi and veronica show up and RT and me worked hard to impress and yeah RT thinks he was a big shot but i was ridin just as good as him and it was my first time. But, after we finished up there we all rode up to the carnival. that place was soooo not jumpin but i had a good time anyway. me and mandi really bonded we got to know each other a lil better and her friend veronica was cool too. i told her to come becuz veronica hated me and i wanted her to get to know me so i could show her i aint that bad of a guy. but yeah we are all cool now. B4 the nite ended i got my face painted like Violent J (singer in ICP) it looked ok. But yeah i kissed Mandi and the make up smeared onto her face lol. and now i am home writin this and talkin to people via AIM my s/n is crzysskd123.   Ok see ya'll later/"

"event","well guys lemme get straight to the point. Girls are toooooooooo dramatic. That's why i am single yet again. However i dont plan on bein for long, being single truly sucks. I just want someone there to hold me and tell me everything is gonna be alright....lol...thats from the wedding singer.(great movie)  I really dont understand why my homies always ask me for the relationship advice, i mean i am your typical guy. sure, i get lots of gurls to talk to me but that dont mean i am some super realationship counselor. shit i have trouble holdin my relationships for more than 3 months. wow..... my uncle is gettin married in 8 hours and i am in the wedding i am nervous i gotta seat people and i mean what if i fall? lol i guess i shouldnt worry ill be aight. okay bitches, PE@ZE  im outtie."

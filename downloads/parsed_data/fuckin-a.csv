feeling-tone
perception
volitional formations (thoughts, feelings about)
consciousness

You Are Not Even Awareness

 cashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoney

don't hate your anger or doubt or your hate, or say ""it shouldn't be this way, i can't be thinking this."" just say ""it's like this"" and know it with awareness... you don't necessarily even need compassion, just peaceful coexistence

-you are your best laboratory to practice non-violence0

may i meet this moment fully, may i meet it as a friend

there are ways of being not out of greed, or aversion

find your deepest intention and keep coming back to it, try always to know it
not attached to outcomes 
what is my deepest intention?

 cashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoney

~renunciation~ comes on its own when mindfulness-wisdom (awareness-acceptance) is [bravely, brazenly] brought to clinging or craving. interest develops, and the clinging, which <u>obscured</u> what the heart/mind really wants (and is), is revealed and reveals.

we self-liberate (wisdom does the work)

rest. you are no <u>more</u> loving, compass[ionate], joyous, or equ[animous] than before

all greed/craving/clinging and aversion is inherently delusional, based on the false assumption of the existence of self.

we cling to:

sense pleasures
views (""my partner should be like this..."")
personality views (""i am now this, now this"")
rules and rituals

 cashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoneycashmoney

things are as they are
(things are as they aren't?)

compassion without wisdom: crushed!

wisdom without compassion: destroyed!

wisdom with compassion... crushstroyed? being crushed, was luckily destroyed? being destroyed, was crushed (and held in place?)

when someone else is having a difficult experience, the <s>correct</s> natural response is not trying/wanting to make it different, or getting angry that they are ""doing it wrong"" (<u>or</u> delusion that their suffering is separate from you)... but is compassion /for them/ for yourself

may you be happy
may you be peaceful
may you be safe
may you be free from suffering
may you love and accept yourself exactly as you are

i care about your suffering
may you come to the end of suffering

may your happiness continue 
may it increase and never wan
i'm happy you're happy

[ed. may you be free from inner and outer harm]
[ed. we are heir to our karma, our happiness is dependent on our actions, not on our wishes for ourselves]
[ed. ""The results of karma cannot be known by thought and so should not be speculated about. Thus thinking, one would come to distraction and distress. Therefore, Ananda, do not be the judge of people; do not make assumptions about oth-ers. A person is destroyed by holding judgements about others."" The Buddha]

i care about you, but cannot control your happiness or unhappiness
i humbly, honor your journey

neither by philosophical views, holy acts, tradition, knowledge, virtue, nor by not having these, does one know/prove purity. they just wander the world, annoying people.

[ed. full quote: ""After investigation, there is nothing among all doctrines that (an awakened being) would embrace. Not by any philosophical opinion, not by tradition, not by knowledge, not by virtue and holy works can anyone say that purity exists; nor by absence of philosophical opinion, by absence of tradition, by absence of knowledge, by absence of virtue and holy works either; having abandoned these without adopting anything else, let one, calm and independent, not de-sire any resting place.  One who thinks oneself equal to others, or superior, or inferior, for that very reason disputes; but one who is unmoved under those three conditions, for that person the notions 'equal,' 'superior,' and 'inferior' do not exist. The Sage for whom the notions 'equal' and 'unequal' do not exist, would he say, 'This is true'?  Or with whom should he dispute, saying, 'This is false?' With whom should he enter into dispute? An accomplished person does not by a philosophical view or by thinking become arrogant, for he is not of that sort; not by holy works, nor by tradition is he led, he is not led into any of the resting places of the mind. For one who is free from views there are no ties, for one who is delivered by understanding there are no follies; but those who grasp after views and philosophical opinions, they wander about in the world annoying people.""  The Buddha]

<u>when to give, when to practice Generosity (season for giving)</u>
1. when someone arrives (seeing someone)
2. when someone leaves (saying goodbye)
3. when one is ill
4. when there is famine (or in times of poverty)
5. when it does not adversely affect the recipient <u>nor</u> the giver

<u>be generous face to face, unembarrassed</u>
remember thanksgiving at spirit rock
give 1/2 a sandwich

things to think on when <u>lost</u>

-buddha (potential for awakening, in every moment)
-dhamma (truth, goodness)
-sangha
-one's own past virtue (sila)
-one's own past generosity (dana) or sometimes another's
-the devas (?)

notice when wholesome states arise, and see if you can increase them, but do not cling to them

the moment is perfect as it is

love
be service
love (and remember sweeney and the bowl)
(what ended it?)
(it's okay, coulsn't be any other way)

""the thought manifests as word, the word manifests as deed, the deed develops into habit, and habit hardens into character. so watch the thought and its ways with care, and let it spring from love, born out of concern for all beings."" (and don't judge yourself)

touching this place
the unconditioned, that 
which is free of everything,
is me,

brings peace, bring joy, real love, strength

faith is always helpful, never hurtful
hope, not so helpful.
see if this is true.
(faith, not belief. faith is more of an energetic than belief. rules + rituals + views can be unhelpful)

doubt will likely arise for you

if you can, look at the doubt, say ""doubt"", and just watch the thoughts that arise, just notice them, they are okay.

just notice what thoughts arise as you read these notes.

Joy/Passion/Living Life/knowing It Is alive (all slightly different)

compassion for oneself is compassion for every being, and vice versa i.e. your meal is finished, mine will be soon
+joy for another really is joy for oneself

passion=rich adventure(ryan/erich)potential+vice versa

shrooms/lsd= ""my"" version of being fully awake and alive, which is actually everyone's experience of being *alive* because ""i"" alive is ""all"" alive (there is no i) ^^^you can see this on retreat but not Just on retreat

mind tries to find a pattern or habit that will work, remembering the ""conditions"" present during moments of real happiness and replaying endlessly... this doesn't work. no habit will work, only living This moment, and letting it pass, giving rise to THIS moment, and so on. life/joy will arise naturally when we don't interfere (but just know when you are interfering, or at least Trying to interfere)

~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`

for any transgressions against the buddha... for any against the dhamma... against the sangha, i ask forgiveness

control is always the product of fear
-guy

trust, faith, desperation or exhaustion. i reccomend the first two.
-adya

have trust, faith in people, don't try to control them

delayed gratification yields the greatest reward

(relax, observe,) allow

""unbearable pain is its own cure""

unwholesome karma (intentional action) of mind

-covetousness (greed)

-ill-will (hatred)

-wrong view (separate self?) (delusion)

^^^try not to use as an enemy, only a friend

don't die of bitterocity: jealousy, resentment, and disappointment

 ~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`

(on retreat) you remember the powerful parts of your life that you normally avoid because they challenge you and your habits

~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`

there's no right way to practice because things couldn't be any other way, so... you should probably still try/practice/rest in mindfulness/consciousness but noticing the contraction of ""me"" and ""i need to"" and ""look how bad you fuck up you stupid jerk"" and know that it's not needed to survive or even to live magnificently

~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`~`

i don't trust people, knowing that is the truth. 

i love the truth/dhamma, i love to hear it, but my personality is doubt

my job is to find my trust"

"event","Theres a Zen story in which a man is enjoying himself on a river at dusk. He sees another boat coming down the river toward him. At first it seems so nice to him that someone else is also enjoying the river on a nice summer evening. Then he realizes that the boat is coming right toward him, faster and faster. He begins to get upset and starts to yell, Hey, hey watch out! For Petes sake, turn aside! But the boat just comes faster and faster, right toward him. By this time hes standing up in his boat, screaming and shaking his fist, and then the boat smashes right into him. He sees that its an empty boat. 

This is the classic story of our whole life situation.

"event","The first noble truth says simply that it's part of being human to feel discomfort. We don't even have to call it suffering anymore; we dont even have to call it discomfort. It's simply coming to know the fireyness of fire, the wildness of wind, the turbulence of water, the upheaval of earth, as well as the warmth of fire, the coolness and smoothness of water, the gentleness of the breezes, and the goodness, solidness, and dependability of the earth. Nothing in its essence is one way or the other. The four elements take on different qualities; they're like magicians. Sometimes they manifest in one form and sometimes in another.... The first noble truth recognizes that we also change like the weather, we ebb and flow like the tides, we wax and wane like the moon. --Pema Chodron, Awakening Loving-Kindness"

i have been having dreams about hanging out with all of you and doing regular things. last night, me josh and justin played video games, for a few hours. in my dreams. waking up, i remembered that the night before, me and my little brother walked around and talked about stuff, and i chilled in the house with da family. i am sure i have been dreaming about all of you, all of YOU, too. the main difference in this dreams is that everyone is real people (no composites) and everything is really ordinary and satisfying until i begin to wake up when things get strained and one situation starts to loop, and i'm caught between the desire to stay asleep and the calmness that the dream world has given up to conscious shared reality world, where there is wind always in the distance like the ocean through the trees the hills and crunching and cups rattling here, nearby, here. 

i guess i just miss my friend(S). and video games... and... maybe bowling or something. and things that are arbitrary.
and MDMA. and not MDMA, really. and parties that i hardly ever had fun at, but sometimes i would have a lot of fun at when my body was comfortable and my charm was thriving. worlds that live in my head, and sometimes in facebook pictures that i see but don't envy, but then quietly dream about . don't worry, the days are getting longer and we are all being reborn."

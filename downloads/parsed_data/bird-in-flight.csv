"event","at dawn i watch the early morning light
alighting delicate on one thin strip
of skin, laid bare between two bright
and simple bits of clothes: your hip
exposed, a dimple playing hide-and-seek
above a tight, elastic line across your back,
a crack of shadow daring just to peak
from underneath that taut and narrow track.


my untaught senses ache to drink you in,
their fledgling thirst unquenched by sight alone;
i pledge to first explore that sunlit trail
i long to touch, to taste, and to inhale,
to listen to the tenor of your moan....

anticipating this i kiss your skin."

"event","i have colleagues!  i met a bunch of them today.  we were all so young and idealistic and so surprisingly well dressed.  not all of my colleagues are as young, but i met mostly mid-20s-ish folks today.  i also got the ""guidebook"" i'm supposed to read [all 597 pages of] by Monday.  huh.  i'm rockin page 45 or so now.  100 pages a day and i will be there!  also, i have some unspecified amount of dvd to watch and many double-spaced pages to write by monday.  plus, i get to convince new york that i graduated college (which i did).  for reasons unexplained, my transcripts did not provide this evidence.  wesleyan grrr.  i have an interview thursday with a k-8 school i might work for.  coo coo ca choo.

ricky loves new york.  he has a cell phone now, which is great.  we've only been around for a couple days, and our apartment is messy, but there is certainly hope for its near future as a lovely place to spend a few months.  then, perhaps, something with mattio and mary in the fall.  randomly.  who is mary?  i don't know, yet, but i trust matt to know that she's cool, rather than suck.  

i also love new york and am pleased to find this sustaining.  when i didn't live here, i was always so up and down about it.  ""should i move here forever or never come back?""  now, i'm committed to at least two years or so and i'm very excited about it.  lesson i am reinforcing a lot recently:  committing to things i know are For Me relieves any anxiety about ""what if i'm just crazy and wrong and they're not For Me so i maybe shouldn't commit to them.""

Right now this feels like the most exciting and scariest thing I have ever done.  My mind is spinning.  I gave my 2 weeks notice at work today.  We get to tell our landperson that we are  moving out in [less than] a month.  We get to move out.  We get to make a whole bunch of really big, important decisions.  We get to drive across the country and hang out with my relatives.  ETC!!!

I've gotten some feedback that I might want to slow down, chill, center myself a bit.

"event","i'm looking for information, resources, books, studies, anything having to do with survivors of sexual abuse by young people.  <lj-cut>various studies report that 25-40% or more of sexual abuse is perpetrated by children and juveniles, yet all of the literature i have found deals primarily or exclusively with survivors of adult abusers.  there is a tiny and growing body of literature (mostly from the UK) on treatment for young abusers (assumed in literature to be survivors of abuse by adults), but i have found literally nothing on treatment, outcomes, experiences, help, or anything for survivors of abuse by other children.  

here is one article that discusses young abusers:

http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/OnlineResources/InformationBriefings/HarmfulBehaviour_asp_ifega26022.html

notice the four-sentence section on ""victims"" that is all statistics and definitions.  a few paragraphs above that, these sentences appear:

""Younger children also display sexually harmful behaviour (Araji, 1997) and a number of NSPCC projects report that the average age of referral has gone down from 17 to 12 years. Thirty-one per cent of those seen at the NSPCC Coventry project are under 10 years old. From 1999 to 2002, 30 per cent of the children or young people receiving a service from NSPCC Lincolnshire for this behaviour were aged under ten years."" </lj-cut>

i have never been sexually abused; my experience is based on thinking about, living with, and loving a survivor.  and in my experience the effects on survivors, partners, family, etc, of abuse perpetrated by another child are distincly different from the effects of abuse by an adult.  i'm so frustrated looking for resources and looking and looking and finding only obscurities and footnotes.  of course every individual's experience is different, but i really want to find something that seems to apply and that validates my partner's experiences and mine.  i'm not just looking for vaildation but also some insights, some words about how other people have dealt with life and how they have felt and how they have healed.

if you have any resources to recommend, please post a comment or email me at grekre at gmail dot com.  feel free to pass on my info to others if you think they might want to email me.  anonymous correspondence is welcome.

also, one resource that has been helpful to me is a book called <U>Allies in Healing: A Support Book for Partners</U>.  it focuses on helping the reader (that is, the partner of a survivor) explore hir personal experiences dealing with the abuse history of hir partner.  it's not perfect and that's not the point.  it's been helpful to me and i recommend it to others."

"event","there's a lot going on in my life right now and i'm finally posting about it.  

1. things with ricky continue in their awesomeness.  our awesomeness, really.  it's so peaceful and productive to be able to sit down with him and talk things out and share thoughts and feelings and all that shit [grin].  we are great at identifying issues that come up for us and then handling them.  i prefer this to drama...  SO MUCH.  it's not always easy but it's genuine and we don't string each other along or play head games.  

2. my job stinks and i'm sick of it.  i've applied to a teaching program in new york and i'm still waiting to hear back.  that should happen next week.  i'm excited, nervous, and terrified about the possibility.  if it's offered, i have some things to handle before committing to it.

3. my health is generally pretty good these days.  a persistent sinus, etc, infection has been giving me some system-wide problems, and that's taking some management to get through, but i'm doing well in general.

4. i've been taking classes at visionworks.  i got into it because ricky did it a couple years ago and it was a huge thing in his life.  he's been non-pushy about it and i resisted for awhile and then it just felt right so i decided to go for it.  for any eye-rollers out there, this is a program that is similar to the harmony courses sayga, amanda, and others did way back when.  so now you can roll your eyes at me too.  i just finished the 2nd part (4 full days 9am-midnight or later) so i'm still on a bit of a training high and i'm completely exhausted.  i can't think of any non-cheesy sounding things to say about it.  fact is, though, that it's been really neat.  part of this has to do with feeling like i'm actively engaged in learning and thinking again.  i was getting sluggish bc of my boring job and no life.  ricky and i have great conversations on our own, but it's so important to keep the outside world available so we have new things to talk about instead of just the old.  another part of the greatness has to do with the people i've met.  i'm not really a sucker for camp friendships and yet i feel really connected to the people in my group.  last night i was talking to ricky about how i went into it kinda subconciously deciding i'd not get too close to people and now i feel a bit unfulfilled because now i wish people knew me better than i've let them get to know me.  so that's kinda my challenge for myself now: surrender to connection.  besides mystique is boring.  sayga, calling should happen! (weak, i know.  what times mon and tues are you available for me to call you?)

5. i thought there was a fifth item.  i was wrong.  i'll use this opportunity to suggest that people leave me comments."

* how to be open to a different conscious life vision while staying connected to the one that is working well for me right now (after having moved on from an inculcated uncoscious life vision of my past)
* maintaining a positive attitude as much as possible
* letting ""negative"" emotions like sadness, upset, etc, end at themselves instead of feeling sad that i'm sad or upset that i'm upset, ad infinitum
* the useful/lessness of internalizing other people's stress OR acceptable limits of empathy (how far can empathy extend before it becomes something else, not ""where to limit empathy"")
* expressing my opinions and character v. badgering folks and becoming polemical
* accountability to others v. acting/behaving to please others
* accepting complexity/accepting simplicity
* owning (being accoutable to) choices and decisions in my life and my future"

"event","i went to this great conference last weekend.  a one-day affair with 3 sessions and some speakers and booths.   it was a wonderful experience for a few reasons.  the biggest was that the opening speaker was Holly Near who i knew very little about before hand.  'peace activist' 'singer' etc.  she opened not with a speech, but a song called i am willing.  it can be heard here http://www.bcaction.org/AudioVideo/IAmWilling.mp3 . 

the chorus is 
 
""i am open 
and i am willing 
for to be hopeless 
would seem so strange. 
it dishonors 
those who go before us 
so lift me up 
to the light of change.""

<lj-cut text=""more about the conference"">
she spoke from her experience (not notes) about open mindedness and open heartedness and bringing our whole selves to every experience and every group and action and every coalition and every ally oportunity.  she talked about the connections between many human struggles and efforts and invited us to become activists in big and small ways where ever we are, even if the action is so unprecedented as attending another active community's event or is as small as saying hello to someone and making a connection.

it really set the tone for the conference and it was the only conference i've been to where none of the activites, conversations, panels, etc., became contentious or devolved into cycles of argument.  people really seemed to take that openness to heart and spirit and bring those ideas with them to the workshops.

after a welldone and way-too-short workshop on privilege and a hilarious lecture on queerness (where the lecturer pointed out the homo-sexuality of an example couple comprised of a man-with-penis and woman-with-vagina both of whom had graduated berkely with phds in english, both of whom taught english at the local college, both of whom etc etc etc... and both of whom enjoyed anal stimulation for sexual pleasure), i attended a panel discussion called ""gender warriors.""

in ""gender warriors"" the tone started out very somber and kind of whiney.  no one takes me seriously as a lesbian because i'm femme and i'm not queer enough.  i'm a fifty year old man who misses the feminine little boy i used to be.  i don't define my gender and people don't understand me and it's frustrating.  etc.  eventually the conversation turned to the awesomeness of playing with gender and how silly it is to let some imagined binarism control our behaviors and desires.  that was nice.  before that happened 2 critical things were brought up separately:

1. the moderator talked about going to chat rooms and forums about gender to prepare to moderate this panel.  she identified as an overweight femme lesbian woman who prefers female pronouns.  (incidentally, ze and hir and derivations are virtually unknown in these parts. it's not that everyone uses gendered pronouns, but the tendency is toward name-only identification rather than 3rd set pronouns)  she said she had read a post by someone who was asking if they could just take a little bit of testosterone and have their shoulders a little squarer and they mentioned some other body details i don't remember anymore and said they didn't want all the changes of taking t, but just these very specific ones.  and people replied online that, no, if you take t or any substance it is basically going to do what it is going to do with your body and you don't always get to decide exactly what that will be.  

and, much later...

2. one of the panelists who is around my age mentioned the fact that we who are around this age have been carefully raised to become superconsumers until everything is a commodity and (this person said) that's kinda cool because it allows us to believe that certain gendered characteristics, behaviors, roles, etc, as well as those that are often ascribed to race, class, and other culture groups, are as accessorizable as the clothing we purchase at the stores.  i'll try on a little machismo today, etc. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""my mind made huge leaps here""> my mind made huge leaps here.  perhaps it is great that we can try on these characteristics and behaviors and roles etc just like metaphysical 2 dollar sweatshop-made t shirts/""peasant shirts"" that we'll give to goodwill and pop culture and the african poor once they go out or style or fail to ""fit"".  i think such rampant commodification can free us up to express our multi and various desires about our identities (whatever that means) and our lives.  but does that consumerism insidiously creep into our psyches and our understandings of ourselves as physical beings?  how is our corporately-cultivated superconsumerism connected to ideas that we are not only allowed to experience and express our desires, but that we should indeed have the right (in the face of a miserly Biology) to embody the exact customizations we desire?  how, in liberating our desires and separating them from the more onorous and relentless category of needs, does the corporate culture create markets for bodies and for ""medicine"" related to customizing our bodies in the forms of hormone supplements, surgeries, and gym memberships?

i am bumping up against a lot here that i have almost refused to talk about publicly before.  there are myriad forms of body modification including penile circumcision, dieting, tatooing, hormonal and surgical contraception, exercise, piercing, clitorectomy, plastic surgery for everything from burn treatment to breast implants and nose jobs to ""sex reassignment surgery.""  i don't have ""a position"" on these things...

i am writing as a citizen of this culture.  i am writing as a person who has used hormonal supplements and who plans to do so again.  i am writing as a person who has had a variety of surgeries for both ""medical"" and ""cosmetic"" reasons. 

i have held my silence so long because of my ambivalence and what i felt was a precarious position with my  history, my ideals, and my social and support networks.  i now think that silence is doing no one any good and i now am approaching this topic with many questions and with the openness i felt on saturday rather than fear and judgments i harbored for awhile. </lj-cut>
 
how do wean ourselves from addictions to control and give permission to our own creativities?  how do we honor our needs and our honest intentions for our lives without capitulating either to externally created Desire or to self-hatred?  how do we go forward as agents in our own skins?"

<lj-cut text=""This Christmas was Very Busy...""> This Christmas was Very Busy. Usually, I open lots of presents with my family on Christmas Eve and the next day I wake up at my parents house (I even slept over Christmas Eve last year which was the first year i wasn't actually living there). Then I open gifts from Santa, do nothing, eat chocolate, listen to someone's new CDs, do more nothing, help make some of the dinner if I feel like it, eat dinner with my family (including my mom's bro & sis), watch someone's new dvd or play with or read something new i got, then go to bed.  Yesterday was a Christmas of a different color entirely.

Itinerary:  

Friday 12/23: 
I worked 11am-7pm in Midvale
Evening dinner and Polar Express Screening with Many Ethingtons at Rick's brother's house in Bluffdale
Meetup and bar with a bunch of friends from High School (mostly mine and a few of his)

Saturday 12/24:
Last minute shopping in AM
I worked and finished/wrapped gifts from 12pm-6pm in Midvale
Dinner and gift opening at my parents' house with my immediate family and Ricky, followed by 11pm Unitarian church service (SLC)

Sunday 12/25:
Wake up 8AM - Ricky and I spent the whole day together doing the following things...
Fabulous breakfast with Rick's mother and his sister, Jenny, her husband and 3 kids, at their house in Farmington
Work shift from 11am-1pm in Midvale (opposite direction from Farmington)
Hang out and lefse-making with my immediate family (SLC)
Ice Cream, cookies, brownies, and hanging out at his grandparents' house with assorted of his widely extended family members (SLC)
Back to my house for wonderful dinner and dessert with my family, my aunt, my uncle and his tenant.
On to Sam's house for another fantastic dinner/dessert of completely different food from 1st dinner, followed by very nice hanging out with lots of friends from high school (majority of my friends, some of his, too).
HOME at midnight and SLEEPING!


I have met a lot of Rick's relatives this weekend.  They have all been welcoming and kind to me.  It was great to see little kids (aged 1-8).  I have been thinking for a long time now that i need some work or volunteer involvment with children again soon.  i really miss the influence of the perspectives and creativity of kids.  i was also glad to meet another of his siblings (Jenny) who was so inclusive with me and seemed so accepting across difference, it made me really happy.  his grandparents were also very nice to me, eventually.  at first, they seemed a bit wary and like they didn't know how seriously to take me or whether to just wait for me to go away.  then after spending 3 hours with them and the fam that friday night, they seemed sincerely glad to have met me and observed me with Rick and the rest of the group.  for some reason i really just expected i'd never date someone from a mormon background, so it's been interesting and surprising interacting with that specific cultural difference.  as in the rest of my life, i am reminded that individual mormons are not the same as The Church and GB Hinkley.  it's funny that he and his brother both kind of enjoy needling the active members a bit, about things like alcohol and whatnot.  that's defintely something i am not going to do with his family.  so it's interesting to watch.

on my side, it was great to have Ricky around for the holiday at my parents' house.  he's so self-sufficient that it's not at all stressful for me to bring him home because i know i won't worry about entertaining him.  when i'm busy with something (like making lefse) he just chills with my sisters or talks to my parents or finds something intersting to look at or do.  my 15 year old sister slaughtered him in You Don't Know Jack.  that was cool.  it was good for him to meet my aunt and be around for christmas dinner (though everything went so smoothly that i felt a bit bad about all the unnecessary warnings i gave beforehand).  my dad gave him a really cool book anthology of various author's self-selected best works and my mom gave him an anime dvd.  he really appreciated both, as well as the associated message that they like him and think he's great.

there was a lot of running around the valley and we were both exhausted by the time we got to sam's house.  but all that went really well and it was the most relaxed hanging out we've had with a big group of HS friends so far.  also, i got my coolest present there, from sam:  a machete.  woah.  it's the coolest thing ever.  i might have to post a separate entry about this machete and it's place in my life.

also, our guests were very chill about giving us slack for having recently moved in.  overall, the visit went really well.  i was concerned at the beginning because there was a Lot of talking about boyscouts and firesides and conference talks and i was worried i wouldn't find a way to relate to them.  then we started talking about other things and it was very interesting and pleasureable conversation about the world, life goals, political systems, biodiversity, etc.  toward the end i caught myself having been having a good time.  they also asked some sincere and strangely worded questions about our relationship that we fielded quite adeptly.  and they brought us homemade pomegranate jam!!! and now both of our fathers have make jokes (?) about one of us sleeping on the couch.  are they really jokes? i think so.  i sensed a lot of mutual respsect and support between ricky and his parents.  like, there's a lot of things they see/do/believe differently and they accept and support each other anyway.  so, that's awesome.  

also awesome has been seeing and hanging out with sam after a few months without her around.  i'm really glad we did a good job of keeping in touch while she was in guatemala.  i'm still kind of missing her but i know it is fine and we're going to spend a bunch of time together and it will be lovely as usual.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""moving is an art"">
eventually, Ricky and I will be Unpacked and Moved In.  until then the living room decor includes spontaneous artistic creations like: Weary Santa Admid Skulls  and Snake Kissing Doll Figure Representation of Gretchen's Ex.  Not to mention the more carefully executed: Wall of Full Boxes and it's companion piece:  Pile of Collapsed Boxes.  on display in the bedroom?  a triptych entitled Pile of Clothes 1, 2, and 3.  also, Pink Unicorn, Rubber Chicken, and Dagger in a Bucket next to Laptop.  yeah, the art is creative even if the titles leave something to be desired. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""just a little bit more on ricky""> there are a lot of ajdectives to describe ricky. some of them are: wonderful, positive, supportive, creative, intelligent, thoughtful, and loving.  really, if you don't know him, you should visit us and meet him. and if you do know him, you probably don't see either of us as often as you'd like to, nor as often as we'd like to see you. thus, you also should visit us. </lj-cut>

there's still a lot of screaming going on upstairs, in case you were curious.  I AM!"

"event","great things, in alphabetical order:  

1.  sam is coming home on sunday!!!!!  we are hanging out together all day monday!!!!!  so there.

2.  we (ricky and me--clarification for those who've been living in a toilet) are largely moved in to the new apartment and it is really just awesome.  for locals, we'll be hosting a gathering sometime soon and i'll give you details and you should come.  for those far away, come visit me!  we have tons of space.

good things:

1.  i have been corresponding with a person i knew only a tiny bit a bunch of years ago and it makes me happy.

2.  new (second) job.  working as support staff at a home for women who are recovering from chemical dependency and [their] kids.  good rather than great because i'm really excited about the opportunity and because i'm nervous about the time commitment (minimal, really) and added stress of juggling 2 jobs and schedules which was not fun in the past.  we'll see how it goes this time around.

bad thing:

someone tangentially important said something kind of off the cuff to me and it's really bothering me.  i know the person didn't mean it personally and i even think the person might not have said it if they'd thought about it for a moment more.  it's really more the comment than the person that is upsetting me (and a little bit the fact that the person even said it).  that's because it was a factual rather than opinion based comment.  i would not like to talk about it.  i would not like to deal with it.  i would like to avoid it.  apparently i cannot do that.  i ""know"" it's not helpful for me to be upset about it and that is just where i am right now anyway.  i never know what to do [with my brain] in this situation."

ricky (<lj user=thestudyofjazz>) and i signed a lease on an apartment!  it's a huge apartment with a fireplace.  we move in dec 1.   wow.  i'm falling asleep or i'd post more details.  i will definitely get on that within the next couple days.

For Phillip:  SLC, and you should visit.
For Ben:     Ricky, who i'm pretty sure you know from wasatch, bryant, and/or west, and when are you coming to SLC for holidays?"

"event","i'm feeling a little off today.  this morning i had some bad dreams, which is rare for me.  after i woke up i had this really split feeling where part of me was just breaking down from the scariess of both the dreams themselves and the experience of even having bad dreams.  the other part of me was remembering some really funny things that happened yesterday and starting to giggle hysterically.  so i really was bouncing back and forth between crying and giggling.  it was totally weird.  it was comforting to have ricky there (though he wasn't in the dreams and i kept wishing he'd show up and i was a little resentful about that for a moment after i woke up).  

i felt mostly fine for awhile after i actually woke up and got past the mental state i'd had in the dreams.  now i'm at work and i'm just achey.  my knees hurt and my head hurts.  i'm staying hydrated and eating, kinda, though i don't feel hungry and it's been awhile since breakfast.  oh, but breakfast was nice!  good not-very-awkward bonding time with ricky's mom who actually let me help when i offered.  

something happy is scheduled to happen tomorrow and after it does, i will post about it.

friends, ricky is wonderful.  i'm a little lj shy so i'll save the details for more private conversations and if you want to know more, just ask."

<lj-cut text=""my current favorite thing ever"">

my current favorite thing ever:

(brought to you by the HRC, in coalition with the Partnership for Forgiving Us for Our Deviant Natures, and Letting Us Play the Normal Game, Pretty Pretty Please? [PFUODNLUPNGPPP, a 501(c) nonprofit])

What do we want? 

Maintenance of the status-quo, constant re-emphasis of the misfortune of non-hetero object choice and appeals to biological essentialism, oversimplified, callous, and alienating conflation of different modes of oppresion, slow-motion legislative pogroms against non-normative sexualities, and trust-funds and more complete dental coverage for our adopted/in vitro fertilized 2.5 children!

When do we want it?

Whenever is convenient for the capitalist heteropatriarchal establishment!

"event","i haven't felt like updating recently, but three events today have convinced me to return to the keyboard.  

1.  a conversation with <lj user=""mattio""> in which i was reminded i was going to post about a previous really fun conversation we had in which these exchanges occurred: 
a. ""you're totally reifying the spectacle!""  
""wait, wait, wait.  ok?  wait.  [pause] reify me gently.""
b.  ""ok, but i think that totally misses the point i'm saying.""
""ok, reframe me""

2.  i read an article about blogging in schools and totally got into the social project of it and then felt like blogging (even with nothing to say!  that is the miracle of self publishing!)

3.  i read this comment on transportation in korea and wanted to share: 
""The bigger cities have subways to get around, and in the smaller cities the bus networks are regional. Taxis are also numerous. All modes of transport are quite cheap. The exception to this is all travel via helicopter.""   

<I> what?  one can't affordably take helicopters all over the country?  what a rip off!</I>

also, if you don't know this comic, you should:  http://qwantz.com/20030201.html    
it's the kind of comic that gets better as you read more of them, because you really begin to get a sense of consistency of the personailities and physical postures of the characters."

"event","A while back, lefties were using the term ""gulag"" to describe the Gitmo and Iraqi prisons where US detainees and terrorist suspects are held.  At the time, I felt like that was poignant, but maybe not really great strategy because it sounds like exaggeration.  Well, now the Washington Post reports that the CIA is using actual literal Gulags -- old prisons in Eastern European ""democrasies"" that are left over from when the government of the USSR would hold and torture dessenters in them.  This article tells more about these ""black sites"" where prisoners (many who have not been charged with any crime) are kept for undetermined amounts of time without any contact with the outside world.  They are interrogated with ""tactics"" that are illegal in the US, UN, and host countries. Here's the link:

i feel increasingly less connected to a person i used to know inside and out and who will not read this
the printer on this machine just quit working
i felt a lot better a couple hours ago and now i feel a lot worse (coldwise)
i thought there was something else.  that's good that there is not.

Having slept throughout the day
In socks and pockets and hee-ditty mittens
They stretch and sneeze a cotton spray.

As quick as a bibbit, as sly as a fox,
Nimble skimbles squeeze through locks.
Plaster and brick won't keep them in--
They'll hibble and mibble through thick and thin.

To the Valdooray!  Matoosh, matoosh!
They skip and pip and calabaloosh!
Through pipes and gutters they spish and spoosh,
With wutternuff zest they swarm the quay.

Down to the wharf, dear one, beware:
The kitters and chitters are gathered there.
They'll ask you to join them, to join them tonight
In fancing and jancing away the fright!

Then whirl and thirl in ginty glee
To nance in the shadows of charry light!
Hoist to the scrow with crust and might
And crast the Power into the sea."

pura vida!  that is what people say in costa rica.  all the time.  as a greeting, as a response to most questions that are not strictly informational, as a general comment on life, etc.  it means pure life and a simlar phrase is hakuna matada in swahili ? that was popularized in the disney movie, the lion king.  
 
well, sam and i are here. <lj-cut> we had the opportunity to be on the internet and in a tree at the same time, but we opted for cubicles for cheaper and we will have coffee in the tree later.  the symbols on the keyboard here are weird.    \let's pretend these are parentheses\ 
 
yesterday we were in san jose and saw a museum that used to be the headquarters of the military.  the outside is riddled with bulletholes from the revolution.  \omg\  and there is a lot of ""precolumbian"" gold in showcases inside.  also, there is a wonderful butterfly garden that is so much better than that one that was at hogle zoo because there are flowers and the butterflies are all alive.  you should google ""blue morphos"" and find a picture of the biggest wonderful butterflies we saw.  when i return, i have many pictures of them as well so i can show them and post them and send them in emails.  
 
we took the longest bus ride ever from san jose to monteverde.  we were both exhausted from the red-eye flight and subsequent navigation to and through el ciudad de san jose.  we had just both gotten to sleep and then there was a stop and a bunch of guys got on and started shouting at us that we needed to buy things from them.  it was a bit like being in a subway in nyc, only it was so much bumpier and hot and sticky.  luckily it was pretty low-pressure sales.  toward the end of the ride, after a stop that lost us our seats together, sam was sitting behind me and we were both sitting by ticos.  we hit a gigantic pothole and bounced very high and many of the people in the bus screamed and after crashing into the guy next to me, things calmed down and he and sam both had their hands on my shoulders and were saying ""esta bien?""  i was, in fact, fine, but a bit shaken up.  it was very nice to have their concern.  sam and i both got bruises.  then, about 30 seconds after that bump, the bus started rocketing down a long stretch of road about 5 feet from the edge of very long drop. many people were expressing their concern about this fact, but i was just trying to tell myself ""pura vida, pura vida, esta bien, pura vida.""  somehow, we made it to santa elena, una ciudad en monteverde, and were met by Freddy, the male owner of Tina's Casitas, who took us in his jeep to our beds.  we were very happy.  hunger trumped tiredness, and we went out to Morpho's for food and pina coladas. 
 
today we took a walking tour of the cloud forest \monte verde\ with Freddy.  his house is about 50km \70yds?\ down the road from the Casitas.  he backed his sky blue jeep all the way down the road to meet us at 6:30am.  when we got in, i saw a little sticker in the window that said, ""por amor, llevar el cinturon."" \for love, wear your seatbelt\  i inquired about los cinturones and was told ""no, no, no es necesario.""  i hoped he was right.  
 
in the forest we saw... 
parots, coati \i think\, a sloth!!!!!!!  tucanettes \small tucans like it sounds\  about a million other birds and a lot of insects, including walking sticks just like in those jungle books we used to look at years ago.  a little dog found us and followed us around for a few hours, our guide tried to send it home a few times, but when we got back to the jeep to leave, it tottered off to its own home quite happily.  there are lots of little dogs around here.  as sam pointed out, not many get spayed and neutred here.  
 
breakfast lunch and dinner are black beans and rice with some or all of the following: \found the colon there, but its and enye on my keyboard\  eggs, cheese, various meat, maduros which are fried bananas.  for dinner last night, sam and i also split a hamburger, hoping the meat politics are better here than there.  it was delicious.  then today we saw a lot of cows and reminiced.  
 
pardon the atrocious spelling.  my language capacities are full right now and there is no room for being critical of my spelling.  speaking of language \har har\, i'm doing quite well in spanish and even better than i had hoped.  i've made stupid mistakes, but lots of times i know the right words and say them in the right order and even understand the response.  this has been helpful.  sam is also doing well.  last night a server at a restaurant tried to joke with us and tell us we can't have a table because he likes other people better.  sam said, ""podemos luchar?""  \can we wrestle?\ and it was funny and everyone laughed.  
 
\at this point in my narrative, the power went out.  i was happy i had recently saved.\
<\lj-cut>
ok, it is time to seek out some cafe con leche and a place to read.  tomorrow, sam and i plan to walk across a lot of bridges high up in the trees, and maybe see some hummingbirds.  if you want to know more, google ""selvatura.""  
 
pura vida a todos,

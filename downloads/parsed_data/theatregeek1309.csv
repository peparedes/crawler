VANCOUVER -- The deadly stabbing of a 17-year-old girl who made everyone smile is tearing the Vancouver community apart, said the Vancouver police chief Friday. 

Anna Svidersky, a Fort Vancouver High School senior, was stabbed in the chest by a stranger while working at McDonald's Thursday night, said Police Chief Brian Martinek at a news conference.

""It's tearing us apart, quite frankly,"" he said. ""There's no magic wall around Vancouver. We've had two young girls killed in the last six months,"" referring to the November 2005 murder of 14-year-old Chelsea Harrison. 

Svidersky, who would have graduated in June, was taken to Legacy Emanuel Hospital in Portland where she died around 9 p.m. Thursday. An autopsy was scheduled for Friday morning, Martinek said. 

The suspect, David Barton Sullivan, was charged with first-degree murder Friday morning.

Police collect evidence at the crime scene.
""We preliminarily determined he had an intent to kill,"" Martinek said. ""The suspect armed with a knife walked into one of the doors of McDonalds.... found the victim at a table and stabbed the victim. There's not a whole lot of question about what happened and who did it."" 

Many employees in the McDonalds saw what happened, he said. 

The owner of the Vancouver McDonald's, Matt Hadwin, issued a statement saying, ""We are shocked and saddened by this random act of violence against one of our employees. Our thoughts and prayers go out to her family and friends during this difficult time. We are fully cooperating with the Vancouver Police as they investigate this incident."" 

During a court appearance Friday in Clark County Superior Court, Sullivan was shaking and twitching. The judge ordered he be held without bail. 

Sullivan, a registered sex offender in Washington state, will be arraigned on the murder charge April 28. He also has a criminal history that includes kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment, according to court records.

Suspect is registered sex offender 
In addition, Sullivan, who lived at home, has a history of mental illness, said Police Chief Martinek. 

Sullivan had pleaded guilty to unlawful imprisonment with sexual motivation in 2003 for trying to kidnap a 14-year-old girl in Vancouver. He was sent to Western State Hospital, treated for paranoid schizophrenia and found competent to stand trial. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail. 
""This is obviously very tragic for everyone involved,"" he said. The Vancouver Police Department ""wants to pass on its condolences to famiy, school and community."" 

Nancy Faaren, principal at Fort Vancouver High School said Svidersky's death ""is a very sad day for Fort Vancouver High School. Svidersky was ""well-liked by students and staff alike. She will be greatly missed by students and staff."" 

The senior had a good sense of humor and contagious laugh, and juggled several jobs as well as full-class load, she said. 

School counselors would be helping students with their grief, Faaren said.

David Sullivan, a suspect in the stabbing of a Vancouver high school student, enters court.
Shortly after the first 9-1-1 call about the stabbing at McDonald's, at 2814 N.E. Andresen St., emergency dispatchers received a report that a man was being pursued on foot and police dogs were quickly sent to the scene. Martinek said several witnesses from McDonald's had followed Sullivan from the restaurant. . 

Officers said he was soon captured and a knife believed to be the murder weapon was found nearby as well. 

Police have not determined a motive in the stabbing. The McDonald's is located in an area about halfway between downtown and Orchards. 

The girl's mother found out about the attack when she showed up Thursday night to drive her daughter home from work. A Russian-speaking Vancouver Police officer accompanied Svidersky's family to the hospital Thursday night.

The McDonald's restaurant was closed Thursday night after the stabbing and re-opened at 6:30 a.m. Friday. McNicholas said the staff at the fast-food chain was struggling with the loss, as were police, even though they didn't personally know the slain teen.

"event","OMG the macbeth DVD rondina gave me yesterday was sooooo messed up!! besides the fact it was our worst show (the one when jeremy got his eyes glued shut by the fake blood so he missed the cauldron scene and josh had to improvise his lines when alex stood up a second time- in jeremy's place) and right after josh almost decapitates devin's head, it imidiately flows into the scene we pete kills josh, but lyk 10 seconds before they start fighting. it continues until the very end then it starts curtain call then it cuts to the empty stage w/ red tinted lighting. then it blacks out and you hear cochran yelling at the 8th graders and the rest of the audience leaving. then it starts the first 3 or so scenes all over again!! how messed is that?! lol

in english we're FINALLY done vocab (except for the final) and our greek mythology presentations.

tryouts for the stuctured improv play for the fall are next week and i cant wait! we also might be going to LA during feb break!! :) we're gonna do the children's play in january but tryouts are in november and to kill a mockingbird for the fall- unless we cant get the ethnic diversity to do it then we're probably gonna do the diary of anne frank instead- we might do DAF for competition if it's cutable aswell. yeay!!! cant wait!! love the plans for next year!!

Macbeth 2006- to good to go on: ""hell, how many people can say they made shakespeare their own?"" well- we did!!!

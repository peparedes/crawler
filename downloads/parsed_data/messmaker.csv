"event","it seems like every year i update my journal.  so heres 2006... nothing new.  another year, anither year older.  i'm gonna be 21 at the end of march.  i suppose that will be exciting.  i can drink in public. yay!  i was thinking on my bday when i go out to dinner with my folks, i'm gonna get a beer.  i wanna see how they'd react.  i'm sure it'll be uneventful.  i've been thinking about moving back home.  i don't know how long i'll be able to take that but we'll see.  i'm hopeing i'll get a new better paying job and can afford my oun apartment.  maybe it's just this house but i don't think i can live with anyone anymore.  it's not that i'm a private person or like to walk around naked (well yeah theres that too..)  but when i need quiet i NEED quiet.  liveing with peple who never have to wake up early makes it hard to get to sleep.  but getting my own place is probably far in the future.  and i'll be at my folks house so i'll have plenty of time to check prices and see whne the prices fall and that sort of thing.  for now all is well..."

"event","once again i'm sitting here at work.   my boss is out at a meeting and i'm here all by my lonesome.  tomorrow is my first day off in about 3 weeks and it still doesn't count cause i have to wake up at the crack ass of dawn to go to pa for thanksgiving.  i wish i had more time off around thanksgiving i would have gone down to florida to visit my momma and see my sista too.  bummer.  oh well. i still get free food and i don't have to cook.  i'm not looking forward to friday.  every place is having a sale at the mall and i have to work as much as possible.  chesapeake knife and tool is having a huge 20% off sale from open til 12 noon, both friday and saturday so it'll be busy like some shit.  i should make alot of money tho.  the last sale we had (2 sundays ago)  the mall was open until 930 and i worked 9 1/2 hours and since i was in charge that day i had to help everyone and only sold a few manicure things and it sucked.  and then the next sunday i had to work 10 hours.  point being i have to sell alot.  the weather has also been horrible so no one has been shopping which just means come friday everyone should be out and about.  it'll be a big day.  i'm gonna get the scooter from home and park far away (cause i'll pretty much have to) and then just scoot to the mall.  that'll be fun.  everyone is talking about parking at the marriott and walking to the mall just so they have a place to park.  i'm just gonna do all my christmas shopping at target.  i work alot.  and the saddest part about it is not that i hardly ever see my friends or lack of sleep but that i am saving nothing.  most people that work even one job are saving there money for something.  and yet i'm still living paycheck to paycheck.  that is the biggest downer of all.  it makes it so the fact that my life is going no where is rite in my face.  i feel like i'm in a rut. and i am but what am i suppose to do about it?  it is not a good time to change jobs and i'm finally learning alot at the mortgage company.  and learning = more money.  but when will i see this money... not very soon.  i should get a nice bonus around the 9th or december but i want my present to my dad to be $3000 cause i owe him lots of dollors.  i dont really know how much so i over estimated so he'll be really happy. he's been really nice about not taking my car from me.  so i want to thank him. 

holiday cheer makes me sick to my stomach.

i know i'm not the only one but the whole christmas season is not a good time for me.  i hate christmas and can't wait for it to be over.  the only part about it i enjoy is buying things for people i know they will like and getting excited about that.  other then that i can't wait til all this is over.  and now my boss is back so i'm going back to work...."

"event","so i'm not an angry person.  at least not on the outside.  i'm not one to say anything when i'm angry.  but for a while now all the things are just adding up.  it's not one recurrence or one person but i don't know if i can keep being this quiet.  i go out of my way to not be mad at anything and not to let anything bother me.  i like to think i've been pretty good about it.  i try to be agreeable.  maybe it's just the time of year.  fall has never been easy but somehow i get by.  extra stress is not what i need.  but what i'm i gonna do?  nothing most likely.  
i'm not at a point in my life that i like.  i need to get away.  just a weekend is all i need.  just enough time to go to nc.  theres something there i've been meaning to see.  it's only a 5 1/2 hour drive.  maybe if i go see this things i'll feel a lil better.  
i talked to my sister for an hour.  that was nice.
i'm gonna go find a book or a movie... something..."

"event","so here i am sitting at work.  boss told me to be here between 10 and 1030 and naturally i was late.  i got here at 11 and boss still isn't here.  i could be asleep still, in my comfy bed.  thats rite i have a bed now!  so i'm kinda really bored.  and i have nothing to do tonite but i'm sure i'll find something.  i can't wait for the weekend to come.  i know i work on the weekends which make them suck but i have sunday off!  my first day off in a very long time.  i think i'm gonna go to pa with my folks if i'm not too hungover.  that would be nice.  oh but my bro might be coming home... so should i skip going to pa to chill with my brobro?  i just don't know.  maybe.  i will know when that time comes.  no matter what it's gonna be a good weekend.  

my sista tried it... i might as well too:
grayson (most of you know him) has an adorable lil puppy.  but that puppy is here in MD and grayson is in LA.  this makes grayson, and i'm sure the puppy too, very sad.  my sista and i have plotted to supprise him with the puppy.  the plan is we raise money (cause we are oh so poor and hungry) for me to fly down to baton rouge with the puppy. then sara will pick me up at the airport where we will put a giant ribbon on the pup and bring it home to surprise gray.   so far everything is going well except the donation part.
all me need is $10 from 30 people, or $20 from 15.  if would would like to help reunite a boy and his dog please let me know.  you can post and comment here or even call me (240)483-8938.  on the puppies big ribbon we will put on him will be the names of all those who helped.  $10 isn't that much money if you think about it.  but it is to starving children like us.  if you would like to donate more then you rock.  help that cause.

back to rambling:
i haven't made a big post like this in a long time.  andi haven't made a big post that isn't angry in even longer.  this is exciting.  no, not really.  i'm just bored...  and with this i will go...
you take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have, my life."

damn i'm lonely.  i wanna be home.  i wanna be partying at sams.  i wanna be home.  when i was lil i used to think if you wish for something enough it'll come true.  of course i learned early on that thats bullshit but it would be nice to have that hope again.  i very much dislike it here.  it'd be nice for a weekend maybe but an entire week.. hell no.  positive ways of lookin at the last day here: since i leave here at 6, depending on when i wake up it's really only 6 more hours here,  and hey subtract the time spent watching tv it's only about 5, subtract the time spent sittin in the hot tub it only about 3 hours.  so only 3 more hours of hell to endure.  thats not so bad.  it's not helping.  i wanna be home now!  oh sunday is gonna be nice.  seeing my pals again.  but i'm here when i could be there chillin with them now... just clench you teeth and bare it, kt, clench you teeth and bare it."

"event","important lesson for midnite feedings: there is a way to prevent the annoying ding from a toaster.

currently i have absolutely no food what so ever in my house.  not even milk or bread.  i had an incredibly small amount to eat today so i went in search of food in the dark corners of my freezer, the only possible place for food to still exist.  what did i find there?.. vegi burgers.  i want meat.. ever bite was a huge disappointment.  it smelled good but yet it was vegi's and no meat and tasted nasty.  oh how i long for a real burger.  i contemplated putting the last two slices of lunch meat over it but that would just be odd.  so yes now i am full yet not as happily full as i would be with real meat.  damn... i like food, yet i have none and no way of getting any... *tear*

on a better note this was a good weekend.  

on a sad note i'm, well, sad again... it will pass but it's gonna get worse before it gets better... lets just say august is not a good month for kts."

"event","YERTLE THE TURTLE
On a far away island
of Salamasond
Yertle the turtle
Was king of the pond
A nice little pond
It was clean it was neat
The water was warm
There was plenty to eat
Until one day
The king of them all
Decided the kingdom
He ruled was too small
I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with me

With this stone for a throne
I am too low down
I cannot look down
Upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
He ordered all the turtles
Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle
The things I now rule
I'm king of a cow 
I'm king of a mule

Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burpin' little turtle
Looked up and said ""I beg
Your pardon king Yertle""
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty
""Silence !"" the king of the
Turtles barked back
To the bad burpin'
Little turtle named Mack
I'm Yertle the turtle
Oh marvelous me for
I am ruler of all that I see

Yertle, Yertle the turtle...
Yertle, Yertle the turtle..."

Where time moves too slow day after day
I'll wait and I'll sit and watch the clouds
As they go by.

I have a sensation where lazyness,
Procrastination is what I do best
I'll wait and I'll sit and watch the clouds
As they go by.

Where has my ambition gone
I haven't seen it for so long
Am I a burden to someone?

I am so tired of everything
All my desire is vanishing.

fuck no. not today. not rite here in the middle of the las vegas airport, on the sweaty-hard morning at the tail end of this mass meeting on narcotics and dangerous drugs. . . .

""'be thankful your heart is young and strong', i said. 'if i were you i would never... ah... holy shit!... what?  yes, you'll have to excuse me now; i fell it coming on.'  i turned away and reeled in the general direction of the bar.
'god's mercy on you swine!' i shouted at 2 marines coming out of the mens room.
they looked at me, but said nothing.  by this time i was laughing crazily.   but it made no difference.  i was just another fucked-up cleric with a bad heart.  shit, they'll love me down at the brown palace.  i took another big hit off the amyl, and by the time i got to the bar my heart was full of joy.  i felt like a monster reincarnation of horatio alger... a man on the move, and just sick enough to be totally confident.""

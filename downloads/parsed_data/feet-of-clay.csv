everyone has a job except for me.
last night was a blast.
omar, danielle,steph,ross,and johnny..... i love you all!

my life has been consumed by school and blankness.
yoga is great fun, though,makes me not want to die as much.
so, i suppose i should go and visit my brotherchild, and make with him some ship of sorts.

Lolita is the greatest book ever! who whould have thought that i'd be attached to a pedophile.


and as you were, you'll be again
To mold like clay, to break like dirt
To tear me uo in your sympathy
You were never meant to belong to me 

Who am i?"

If i where black I would...
have sex with the following:
Cockren's dead body + THE REVEREND Al Sharpten + Mr.T + Jesse James & Kanye West while Robert Maplethorppe orgasms and photograps the entire event!
seriously, for ELECTION 2008 that would be the perfect line up.
Mr.T_President
Rverend Ass-smack_Vice
Cockren_sec. defense
and jesse can just bitch about everything.
Maplethorppe can just lobey for gay rights.
Kanye can do something with well fare and panter movements.

So, i hear there's a new adaptation of ALICE IN WONDERLAND (Ashley's favorite cartoon movie ever)
featuring Manson as the Queen of hearts and Alex i'm gay with black/grey/white hair comedian who is the King.

Well ho-fuckin-ray!
Spring break started with one hell of a pow-wow.
first, i make this awesome sabadder (sp?) (well what the fuck anyway, i mean it is French all consonants are pronounced ewaawahh *vomit*)print of this photograph i took in Geneva of these cows, the focal point being two calfs, staring at the camera, with this pissed look on their face. the ""damn god, im a fucking cow look"" boarded with silhouettes of the surrounding herd, and the distortion is superb, so ""mad cow"" for the title fited perfect. but i think ross and i where the only ones laughing. And so it is being exhibited in the student art show selects whatever. so horay! 
then, rehearsal, oh, ashley. 
yes ladies and genitalmen, in a one act.
cosby: im gonna touch your boobie, have some jello.
hehe, its funny when i suck, but i insist on trying something new, for i am terribly afraid of speaking in public, which, is terribly ironic, for me at least. and that shiz sucked, and people, and their "" "" ness.
so yeah, i guess this ""LJ"" can finally really be EMO now.
THEN!
mom basically shits down my mouth, and forces me to pick up the pieces of her broken life.
CUNTASSESS.
thats right bitches my eloquent vocabulary does make me more desirable to be around. :-D
everything is changing, i fucking hate change.
goddamn im becoming a fascist. 
ewh.
all this jive.
where the fuck is my purple shockra?
i love being American, and having the ""Freedom"" to sit in my cozy home, or ross' cozy home, since mine is full of dog shit, literally, and whine, bitch and moan, about little shit. great. great great, my life.  my life, where is my fucking cheeseberger and fries.
and, with all shitty days comes drama with the fabulous BOYFRIEND.
thats right folks, we actually have problems.
but my sweetheart can just sleep right through them. thats why i love him.
his eyes are beautiful though. i'm just to hardXcore.
but it turns out that my bestfriend hates him. how koser. aint that nuthin butta bitch!
well whatever. just one year. juvenile paradigms can blow my assshollle.

i wonder if mrs./mr/ib englishII teacher is suggesting that public urination on a fellow classmate's scratched back is appropriate now. or is that under the zero tolerance policy?
*giggle*
but i guess the bee book does leave us with some estrogen pumped morals. i.e. ""pissing is better than sex"" and fornicating with elderly black women in a creek and things of that nature.
after reading that book i automatically started educing ovulation.

i finally start violin lessons Thursday! yay!

went to the gyno. she was nice. up in the stirrups... she investigated my anatomy with a lot of cold metal objects.
Turns out, she believes that my right ovary has a hemorrhaging cists on it. 
Also! there is possibility of an infection in the pelvis from something like appendicitis and effected my nether parts.
some jargon like that. so she thinks that all of this blood collecting in that region is the cause of the great amounts of pain.
=rx bextra 20 mg bitches!
=and also, a trip to the hospital for a pelvic ultrasound!
so its off to a pantless photo shoot for me come monday morning.
oh, how glorious.

ohh last but not least,i made the toilet over flow, cuz it flushed funny, so i thought that i'd do the up-right citizen type thing and lift the lid to investigate, pulled on something, the wrong thing, and water comes squirting out everywhere, toilet water rises...
i'm fucked.
so i just calmly walk out of the bathroom and into the patient room thing...lovely
it was quite the 'Horrorshow just i suspected it would be.

Jesus. i hate my dad, fuck you guys. ashley your blahfuckshit.i'm an adult (21) and know everything with the maturity level of a 5 year old. and things of that sort.

Ashley has inserted toothpicks into her front ear lope holes with wishes to gauge to about a 10 or an 8. but mother, upon seeing last nights activities, has flipped out, and is against my humble wish of having doped out chickabountbount fucktatsic earlobes. i've talked to a lot of people who have only gone to an 8 and when they took them out, they returned to about normal size, like 18 or something. my oh my; mother knows all.they are my fucking ears, and if i choose to make a statement about the aboriginal tribes of Africa, damnshitfuck, i will. Besides, i have some of the coolest toothpick looking black plugs, i just gots to have them in. Honestly, I can have an industrial, which is a 16, but not gauge my ears?

"event","ashley has arrived home.

today was rather lovely...

i'm going threw sr.faggot withdraws...i wish i was in england as well...
summer reads suck my ass.fuck ""graphic novels"" and 50 year old virgin black beekeepers. 
baha, it was a good book, thought, i enjoyed it.
now its time to read the idoit by Devorooisikskiyisk(that russian guy who wrote crime and punishment) with the most impossible name ever.

fucking algergies...


And as they faded I stopped to speak
I painted flowers
and nobody knows why..... 

No awakening, no lullaby
I only felt the need to try
To have the guts or the stupidity
To grab for stars, that I can't reach at all

Father see, that I have tried
To find that angel deep inside
That you once promised I would meet
And once again I ended in defeat

Even here I could feel your eyes
Heard your whispers and felt your eyes
Brother said Come back to life 
I asked some friends 
and nobody knew why .....

Nobody had ever seen
my flood of tears 
I can't believe you found me here

It took some time to find these words
I wrote them down in hope that they might help
Watch me walk barefoot on glass
Insecure as only a newborn child can be

Others came to laugh at me
They pointed fingers as I could see
Believe me saying it's not the skin
It's the stranger living deep inside

Mother see, that all my life
I painted flowers to survive 
And as they faded I stopped to paint
I fell asleep
and nobody knows why..... 

Father see, that I have tried
To build a world with only me inside
Millions of flowers surround my bed
Now I still grab for stars and I can reach them all"

"event","i could have died,
maybe i should have died.
when i saw you walk inside.
and as you shut the door
i put my eyes back on the floor.
when all i really wanted was to look some more. 

does a wallflower play,
or does a wallflower stay on his wall? 

you see i live alone, 
but i've made my happy home.
all my furniture is centered around my phone.
i'm waiting for a call,
my imaginary friends and all.
those who would never let me be taken by the fall.
does a wallflower know, 
when it's time he outgrow his wall?
tell me does a wallflower know 
when it's about time he outgrow his wall... 

time and time and only time has feeling for me.
maybe father time will feel sorry for me.
i knew when there was time, when i knew it all.
why don't i ever leave my wall?
why don't i ever leave my wall?
why don't i ever leave my wall?
...i don't ever leave my wall. 

you know that siren's getting louder,
and these people are starting to crowd in on me.
(all i smell and taste is garlic and gunpowder)
'cause i shot the bad guy dead -
but he got me in the head.
with the girl of my dreams
she's mentioning to me how much I've bled. 

where does a wallflower go, 
when their flowers get pulled from this wall?
oh and though she says I'm brave and bold,
she knows a flower cannot hold up a wall.
i can't hold up this wall any longer...
any longer
'cause all I have is time and time
and time 
my only friend time and time
please some more time.
i think i'm over..."

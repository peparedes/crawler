Right i have no internet in my room, I have no internet in uni cause i havent payed rent and they have quickly disabled my access (motherfuckers) I am sat in Brads room (which i broke into) and using his computer, which he moves out with on sunday, I dont have enough money to really go anywhere, and although i have been trying with all my might nobody wants to employ me !! Pfff

But things arent all as bad as they seem, there are possibilities, that include me maybe living with Freya over summer which would be amazing, and she seems to think i will get a job and make a packet there, so lets hope. And supposedly I might be able to get a job in newport, otherwise i will have to try ticketmaster in manchester and finally...i dunno Whore?

Errr oh debt collectors are after me too :) hehehe, I rule
So ring me folks, cause i am still alive"

I finally have a house on one of the corners of the Bullingdon road, and I dunno what to do with myself at the moment, have spent most the week badgering along with work, and people who know the current problems (i think theres only the one) will be happy to know that I have pretty much all but got over it, and my phobia for home, so will probably be going back for my birthday. Anyways I just saw a really big empty gap in my livejournal and thought that I wanted to fill it, and originally I had so much to say and write and come up with but, now, I dunno, I just cant come out with anything, I think my brain is totally fried, I cant write anything at the moment either, which is a bit of a cock given the fact that I have a dirty big essay in for tomorrow. 

I just need something to happen and I dont know what, and I need my Kate Bush albums back, because this is most deffintely a wuthering heights moment...

The life of Darren takes yet more twists and turns, ups and downs and keeps on going round in circles......

Firstly

Any anonymous persons....FUCK OFF....I dont like your kind

Secondly

Any bitchy folk......FUCK OFF...I think you deserve to die

Secondly.....sorry Thirdly

I am happy, I am doing well, and I am still Darren...So please dont be a stranger...I am always here for everyone and will always be the person that I hope a lot of you still see as a good friend

Anyways....enough of the waffling is LJ-Time !!

Today


Went house hunting (it went rather dismally)....Does anyone really want to live with me and Bradley next year??? I mean I know we smell..I know we smoke and drink a lot....And I know we wathc far too many dodgy films and South Park episodes...But surely thats just the life of the perfect student ??

Anyways...It didn't go well at all

** Its weird, cause I never believe that there was anything really wrong with me, but it seems that there must be, that all this time there was something missing..


I know this isn't really the come-back lj post that should have been, but im generally fucked, and if it wasn't for the fact that i have had so much alcohol i dont think i would be honest with anyone. I need .... I dunno....People I guess !

Just thought I would do a wee updatey

This weekend, well it was a long one
Friday : Met Fa in Piccadily train station and got a train to Bristol Parkway, on the way decided that we were going to take Jesse to Newport and show her the wonderful TJ's. So off we went from Bristol station to my house in Bristol and then got in the car and went over to the Port. Must admit it was good to see the old place it really has been a while since I have been there and not much has changed but..... ITS FULL OF LESBIANS THESE DAYS, and it was all a bit weird. Saw Jo and then eventually Sam and the big Richie T and it was good to see those folks, but they have all changed so much, my children are growing up. Then on the way back decided that we were going to go to my Daddles cause we had booze and the place in Bristol was a bit scarey. So we invited little Gareth on the way and picked him up. There is all sorts going on with him at the moment and I am not entirely sure taht some of it should of happened and not entirely sure that one of his decisions is justified but I will eventually figure out what side I take.

ANYWAYS

We got drunk and then went to bed, in the huge double bed at my daddles !!

Saturday: Got up and then legged it over to Bristol, Then we went around all the shops to find me a suitable Fancy Dress do for the party with Jesse that night, and then went over to the house to get ready. Then spent ages finding the place where Jesse lives, its a bit of trek but we got there and then had some barby and went to Goth club in Bristol, we had a little sit around and then left early so that we could get the last bus so we got home and passed out on the couch with live big brother. We now hear that Jesse had a little trouble, I hope you are ok kidda!!!

Sunday : Got up and had to run round like crazy to find all my gear and get it together and then get it to Parkway to get the train back to manchester, managed to get on the train on time and got here quite early. Then met up with Fa's mummy who took us to my house so that I can drop my stuff off and then took us to watch SPIDERMAN, oh the amazement, it was fantastic, and Bruce BRUCE WAS THERE, and looking great as ever

Monday : Woke up early and had to go to evil work which was suitably evil and then I got back to have to go evil food shopping, but bought lots of junk to make me happy.... INCLUDING RICE PUDDING AND JAM !! yay, Just cant wait to go on holiday now, not only do I get the time of work, not only do I get to go to somewhere hot, Not only do I get to loaf every single day, but I get the supreme pleasure to do it all with Fa !!!

Anyways my bed beckons

Yesterday was mainly spent in bed cause I felt really bad so couldn't be bothered going to work, but did spend most of the day feeling very sorry for my poor little self and eating loads of junk food, watching lots of futurama and also playing far too much Championship Manager !!
Then decided to go to this pub my dad was taking me and my sister too, and it was minging. Well the food was pretty awful and my dad was just being his usual annoying and self centered self !! So then I had the grand idea of getting a lift to where Fa was having her do with her sister for her ickle 16th birthday party (I still don't understand the facsination with 16th's) but happy birthday anyhoos !! Met up with her and watched lots of Big Brother and had a good bitch about that, then I sat and watched TV with Fa and I really had missed her so much all week and it was just great to be back in her arms, I've decided thats my proper home, where I will always be happy and belong !
Woke up this morning feeling worse than yesterday and had to go to work cause my other half in work is now off for two weeks and at least one of us has to be in at all times, so thats my fortnight screwed !!
Work was horrific, more evil customers and twice the workload, I tried to get some people to help but it was like asking people to give me all the money in Buckingham palace, whats even worse was a lot of them were doing naff all and I was working hard an felt mad. Had to stay later again aswell so I wasn't happy about that at all!
Got home and just been chilling out and really missing Fa. I hate being away from her I love her so much and she always makes me happy even after the worst possible days at work, but all I can think for the moment is that I get to spend the whole weekend with her, and I would work a whole year in the poorest of conditions to be this lucky

YAY FOR ME

Anyways im going downstairs to have potatoe stew....hmmmmmm asssshhhhh

See you lata!"

"event","Woke up. Felt like shit. Wagged work. Played Champ Manager all day (Reyes rules!!).

Went to pub. Met my lovely father. Who was a twat and did nothing but belittle me and how well I'd done at sorting all out for uni. So ordered the most expensive meal I could find. If only they hadn't served me the kid's version. DAMMIT. But once recieved, I purposefully ate little of it. Mwahahahaha. But drank shit loads of BEER! Ifeel better about myself!!

Then went and met my lovely <lj user=punkymunkygrrl>. And bought her fine wines and cake!!! (well she had the cake from her sis's bday). And then went to Fa's home. To muse, and be tortured by her sister's saxamophone. Although Dudley was considerably distressed than all. But mused about the possible Fa-Darren management team for At Risk *wink wink suck up offer candy to the biatches*, and now talking to the most fantastic <lj user=""jessica_phoenix""> about boobs and corsets. On that note, I'm off to give Fa pleasure. TMI. BYE!!!

(PS the capitals and cheeky grammar adherence is all down to Fa who typed this...I have not been impersonated...but I do love her, she is WONDERFUL and BEEEEYOOTIFUL and FANDABBYDOOBY...ok then, maybe she has taken control....BUT wireless keyboards mean that i can type whilst she is watching the screen!!!! but i must say that she is the most beautiful person in the world and i love her very much nd wish to stay with her for the rest of my life and have lotsd of babies............ about as many as she can stomach !!!!! GRRR hehehehehehehehe, i loves that w0oman !!!)"

"event","Heylo

My day has been quite terrible.

Went to work, which is bad enough seen as though all I want to do is go see <lj user=punkymunkygrrl>, and had a pooh day. Yet more customers shouting at me for stuff that isn't my fault and all I can actually do is agree with them. I felt like crap aswell which really didn't help so I kept running to the loo to blow my nose and generally feel sorry for myself but I cant really moan but I was feeling crappy, and in desperate need of <lj user=punkymunkygrrl>.

So we got through the day with not too many hitches apart from lots of problems that were not my fault that I had to fix cause other people are so crap at their jobs !! And then we had a bit of problem, someone was trying to fraud us for nearly 12 hundred pounds and I knew myself that I had let it slip and it was my fault, and they called me into a meeting at 5:30 (when i was supposed to be finishing) and I thought it was to tell me that I was being let gone, BUT, it turns out I was the one that stopped it and my lovely lazy way of working ! YAY FOR ME !!!! And the meeting generally revolved around how we are going to stop these naughty people nicking our monies.....well not mine cause I get paid peanuts, but someones money !!

Got a lift home with Bill, cause although I was supposed to be finishing for half five the meeting meant I had to stay till six, so I was determined to not have to then dive on a bus and spend ages getting home. So homes I get

And steve was mowing the lawn and wanted some help......Steve with lawn mower ...... hmmm imagine Leatherface with a Flymo and your near enough. So now im knackered physically mentally and just generally in need of lots of hugging time with my wonderful <lj user=punkymunkygrrl>!!! I miss her :(

Off to play Championship Manager and make something of myself with Manchester United and Arjen Robben !!!"

After the events of the last month things have finally started looking back on track, I made a humongous cock up and I am forever thankful that I am in a situation now where I can safely say that me and Fa are seriously back together and looking back on track to spend the rest of our lives in each others company. Which is a hugely fantastical thing!!!

I apologise to you all for all that has happened and can only thank you all for being there for Fa like the truly wonderful friends you are

I love Fa more than I love anyone inclusive of myself and will always but her goodwill before my own. I will forever remember this as the time I nearly lost the most precious thing in the world to me and I will never want to feel those feelings again

So back on with it hey ?

You probably all know the goings on of this weekend due to Fa and Gilleths Lj's so I shall save you the bother of all that

But today. Went to work and took Cat and Dan with me to drop off at the bus station, the pair of them had been to see Morrisey last night. They were somewhat knackered. bless em, but they were safely away I hope. Then got to work somewhat late, but not fantastically, but who gives a toss cause that place is really starting to get to me now. All I get day after day is shitty customers and I wouldn't mind but there is nothing to tell them except they are right, and the service really is bobbins !!!
Paul was chunnering crap all day, but on the plus side I sent my official, no turning back, fly or die, acceptance slip to brookes, so expect me next year folks

Nehooos I gotta sort a computer out for some kiddies next door

Do take care !!!"

It gives me something to aim for on a monday morning when i cant be arsed doing work so i sit around on the internet doing nothing and finding out how many sites i can get myself blocked off in a day!

Its nearly been a year for me and Fa.....I cant wait! and i also cant believe she has put up with me for so long......

i have been under increasing problems with moving my stuff and that means no computer and therefore no internet so i am sorry, i will have my computer on sunday and i will then look into getting the house broadbanded (drag this house into the correct century !!!!)

But in other news i have started working and making some money so that i can go and harass everyone in oxford next year and actually have money to have a life and live and eat and stuff, rather then just living off noodles like i did this year and begging my dad to pay my rent and falling out with him and all that crap, anyways i just thought that i would tell you all that yes unfortunatly i am still alive, i am busy very busy, i love fa more then i love anything and !!!

I wanna learn japanesse !!

GET ME BOOKS DAMN YOU ALL !!

I need to get some books and learn, i really dont wanna knwo why, but it has always been something that i have wanted to do and i just thought seen as though i wont actually be in education anymore why not get something todo and i put the two of those together and my primitive mind said LEARN JAPANESSE !!!

So anyways, i am going to go and pass out cause i have to be up at 6 to work, now i know non of you will be used to me ever saying anything like that before !!!!

Night night you all
And for the love of god text me and tell me how you all are, or email, or tell fa, or post comments.

I been away from fa too, and i miss her like crazy, i know that i will see her every weekend so i just sort of head for that now, get my head down for the week and just live for work and then the weekend i can stay awake all day all night just so i can basque in her glory (is that the right basque, or is that someone from certain parts of spain (athletico bilbao ??) or should i use bask?? answers on a postcard !)

Hmmm
I decided i wanted to move uni, i decided i like brookes, i decided the course was marvelous, i decided that i wanted to do it (start of darrens week)

Pretty much in brookes, just need a piece of paper to say so (end of darrens week)

Now my head hurts, and ive had the soundtrack to the piano on infinite repeat for hours, and im dying of exhaustion (i think just mentally) and i cant stop whirring around in my head, just dancing with the cows, im staring at the keyboard at the moment watching every single key that i press trying to judege how fast i actually type, and watching as each key depresses and comes back up and im thinking why am i telling you this. is it to prove that i can touch type ? or is to prove to myself that at the moment my mind is just this immense mess of all the shit thats transpired this week. And thru it all there has only been one thing on my mind....... <lj user=punkymunkygrrl>


so
Tomoro going to see the wonderful lass
And hopefully start to get this head of mine sorted, ready to challenege another challenge, and step up to more overwhelming odds. Its times like this u really believe that u can do anything that u set ur mind to, and that u always feel that u can actually do. hmm

In other worries, and thoughts

Something worried me for a few minutes today, as i was sat for an hour waiting for the lovely student advisor at my fantastic university

Hit me like a brick

Me and fa, we will see a lot of each other because of this (not i am going to be going to uni because im seeing fa (common error !)) and will she still want me ? will she still find me interesting even though im there every day
Will she get bored
I hope not
I really do
Really do


Anyways bed calls, manchester awaits and my heads banging
I think i slept about 3 hours last nite, amidst all the coke and manic thoughts i was consuming.
I need this to finish so i can start planning rather then speculate
I can feel my brain twitch

OH the higgledypiggldy of darrens head

Well as you can see im fully fledged and happy again (hence wishing to inflict my mind and endless gibberish onto you all !)

SO

I got looking at uni's and yes i am serious about changing uni now, even though it must now be said that im looking at changing uni, not going to oxford (this is a common mistake) although if i cud pick i wud want to go to oxford. so anyways

Got applying for unis and start looking thru the tinternet and everything so i went to the ucas website and saw that yes i could still apply !! yay for me

Im going to apply, i have started too, i just gotta sort a few minor details out and then thats it
I have had a download random music day today, so i am all clued up on the world of surreal music YAY

Going home for the weekend, had a good chat with my mum and shes going to be uber helpful as always and give me as much support and direction as i will need to go for this. She also brought up the question of Broookes uni and fa, and i managed to convince her that this really is about the uni

Actual words being ""if they moved the place 200 miles north i wud still wanna go!""

SO

Everything going hunky dory .... so far

As for me and fa, we have never been happier as a couple, im happy cause of all this and shes happy at the possible prosepect of all this, so its really all good

Anyways im off to go and assault random people with pieces of bizarre music knowledge in my humongous house

"event","Alright kiddies
Time to clear the wind of this foul smelling mess i have created !

Right
Moving
Sat about and thought a lot about this, thought about why im doing why i first wanted to do it, and why ultimetely i should do it
To start
Fa = plays a large part in this, tho not for the reasons first thought

ME = to be honest not happy at current uni (spent about 40 minutes crying on the fone to fa!)
SO

Lets look at the other facts.

Currently, in my position i thought i was ok, i thought i had it sussed because what was happening was that i was in the mode of thinking ""do work so u can see fa"" which then deterioated into ""hand stuff in so i can see fa"", which lets face it was rushed and often not done at all, this was bad and is reflected in my results ! SO the main jist of this point is that i was actually rushing things so that i could get to fa !

Another point. MONEY next year im going to be skint, beyond skint
I can probably pay my rent off with my loan and that will be it, i will be living of ciggerette ends and banana skins, so a year out to save a shed load of money obviously will not go amiss !

Another point, friends and general social life, my social life quickly became Fa's social life because UWE doesnt really offer the clientel that i really want to rutt with. I spent most of my year there because i enjoyed the nightlife, and have had about two nights out here, which were ok but not something that i could do week in week out ! And i have made some pretty good mates (one springs to mind that becomes a better mate the more time i spend with him) in oxford already, and they seem the sort of people i should be with !

A big thing that suddenly hit me was that i am in the position that i dont really get much of selection of uni's (im thick) i just hafta get what im given, i never really looked into anything else apart from what i knew i could get, and i just settled for that. I loved ox the first time i came, i thought it was a great place, for so many reasons ! And i have found a way to get there, to be doing what I want rather then what i can do. 

Bristol is a big place, and everywhere is a bus ride, i dont like that AT ALL and much prefer oxford as a tightly packed and happy town

Bristol reminds me too much of manchester and i spent years getting out of that place, and i really dont want to fall into a b-list manchester !

Bristol is far too close to my dads so everytime i see him it ends in arguements

Bristol is to far away from my mum !! whereas ox isnt that bad

I feel compelled in bristol to take the easy trip to newport and live my life there again rather then actually working on a proper uni experience, i have four friends that i have made luckily and only one of those do i really see out of uni on a social basis.

My end of bristol shuts down at 11pm meaning that if u wanna go anywhere its a taxi (who are rather pricey!)

LACK OF GOOD GIGS !!!!
lol

Lack of irish pubs

..........

I cant say that im not totally 100% about going if it wasnt for fa. But what i am totally 100% is that if i go, i will be happier, i will do better, i will be better off, and i will enjoy myself a lot more. Its going to be so hard to get there, and im going to have to spin a lot to get thru the parent mesh (because do they ever understand!?) but you guys have to believe me when i say, the more and more i sit down, put pen to paper about the pros and cons the more i think its the best thing i could possibly do ! and i truly mean that

If im wrong....................then in however many years time when im on the dole u can all point at me and go ""TOLD YOU SO!""

Thanx especially to pippa, i really do think its great that so many people actually care !! hehe, but all i can say to u all is trust me, i know it seems one way but it actually isnt, Fa isnt being selfish at all, as a matter of fact its me being selfish, im the one thats going to a uni that i wanna, in a place i wanna, with the person i most deffinetely that i wanna (she just gets to have me (which isnt that good AT ALL!))

On other notes

I LOVE FA

Yes i do

Anyways, night night kiddywinks !"

Its been so long
So long

And im back
Back with avengence, vengence i say !
so what has been going on

Well i had the most wonderful time with Fa whilst she was here, found that there is absolutly nothing else in the world that matters apart from her smiling (a nice moment) and found that glow in the dark stars can make u cry when u are not under them with a certain person listening to bjork

So recently theres not been much going on, Fa went and i havent stopped thinking about her and missing her ever since, every day seems to be a race to get through so that i can go to bed and count the days down till i go to see her again at my birthday (which will have the best bday present ever.... FA)

Just been doing uni work which has really been getting to me and the more i think about it the more i think i really am to thick to be in uni and that i got into it thru a lucky stroke, and the fact that i refused to give up, but maybe thats all i need, i dont actually know anymore and i think thats what scares me the most about the whole thing. BUT i did figure out what i would do if i ever failed, so i was quite happy that i always had a fallback plan that would work nicely !

Otherwise thats been it really
Got a really surreal addiction to lego and have bought a lot of it
Eating food
Drinking stuff

And peeing

Anyways take care, expect up to the date updates (old school)

"event","hey kids. this is me on my phone. trying to update my live journal. if it dont work then i do apologise i just had to try it as i never get chance to update it as i am always on the run around. and i love it. and as i have found out more and more with each day that i spend with her i love fa. i love her so much. i was law in bed with her last night with my really cool fake stars and i couldn't help but proclaim my love to her and tell her that she just makes me so happy that i just burst wit excitement about the fact that i will get to spend another moment with her. she is so special and i love her so much. we are currently on our way to oxford. and fa is stood here looking all concerned at what i could possibly be writing! well i hope this works. my fingers ache. i hope everyone is ok. and i do apologise for being non existant recently. it is a problem i will rectify!"

I couldnt really say sorry enough over the phone, or on the internet so i did it by proving what i will do to make her happy

Anyways everything is fine, and i have been awake for 40 hours !!!!"

"event","HELLO !!!!

Its been ever so long, so long, so long so long that longness has forgotten how long longness was cause it was simply so long since it had to remember how long

BUT

I am back, i am planted and i am eating Milky Ways !

Well it has been a hectic roller coaster of a time, but i am back to usuall service now *im sure you will all be very glad to know (whatever!!!! <how many different thoughts can i put in one speech [too many then i have brackets for {yeah right}]>)*

Been for a mad week up north with the missus, and it was amazing, but major problem of the moment is that i miss her madly and i want her here with me BUT im going to be back with her on wednesday, so im sure that you oxford folk should be warned in advance, IM GOING TO BE IN OXFORD WITH HER !!

Causing havok in the way we know best, DRINKAGE

Gotta go to the brand new gig on wednesday, and then theres the white stripes on friday, and then theres the glc on sunday, and then theres blink 182 the friday after and then theres the von bondies, funeral for a friend, franz ferdinand on the sunday and then i might just pass out.....or maybe go see the distillers hmmmm :S

recently there hasnt been too much going on, apart from a really big addiction to 24 (the bbc, soon sky one, tv series, YES TV) and i was so gripped that i had to watch both seasons box sets consecutivly and with barely any sleep in between...... so that was fun

Spent lotsa time with superfa, and yes i am totally in love with her as always and soppinesss will continue to ensue, cause i love that girl so much and i just never wanna leave her and i never want this to end, just hope she will stay with me forever ! lol... i know thats asking a lot !

Well otherwise theres been not a lot on, had an exam last weeke that went quite well, but then again i always say that and fail really miserably, im currently sat around dancing around, i just literally got back in the house for the first time in a week, and everyone is downstairs watching the goonies and i am starving ! REALLY STARVING

I bought Fa some choccies......hmmmmm choccies

Anyways im gonna go and abuse everyone and make supernoodles....hmmmm super !!

I love Fa (sorry that was to piss <lj user=graium> off, cause it has just been so long, i also said it cause i actually do love fa, she is amazing and i want her to know that i love her and i want everyone here to see ! EVERYONE I SAY

its has been far too long since i have informed all the kiddies out there what is the current status of my life. Its been christmas and new year and no one knows quite how much i have done and just what delights i have to share with you all. BUT
Do not worry, do not make haste as there is an answer, in the way of this, a super mega update that will take years to write years to read and many millenia to understand and fathom !

SO

Where it all started, i went home to manchester on the train and that in itself was a big pain in the arse
I left my place with all my bags and stuff, and my lovely scalextric that i had bought for my step dad, i left just in time to get the bus to the train station and that would of give me enough time to walk through town to get there and everything would be hunky dorey. So i sat on the bus only to realise two stops down the road that i had forgot my fone. Not too much of a problem i thought but it was when i realised that the information i needed to get my tickets so that i could actually get on the train was actually on my fone as i had left it on there thinking ""i wont forget my fone .... will i?""
So off the bus i got and on to another one back to my place, ran to my place with scalextric, ran upstairs, got fone and then went back to my running (with a quick beg to john who wouldnt give me a lift !) so i got to the bus stop got on the bus, ran all the way through town to temple meads train station, ran through the ticket collection point begging people to let me go in front, and then ran from there to the train that was just about to go, and it was packed. and i smelled, and everyone was looking at me funny. And the scalextric nearly hit a kid half way through the journey.

SO

Back to manchester and there was much rejoicing as i met my lovely mother and stephen.

It was so cool to be home and sure enough the first night was spent going to the pub and generally having a laff about my whole day. The rest of the weekend pretty much followed suit, and then it was time, it was time to meet Fa and i was so happy because i had waited so long, i had gone through so much work, hardly slept, and was so close to her for nearly three days but just couldnt see her, and it was nasty and terrible. BUT here i was and i was about to meet her and she was going to come round and spend some time at my mummies and meet all my mad family, and do you know what. IT WENT SO WELL. They loved her, she loved them, it was all so happy, we went straight to the markets in lovely manchester and bought lots of christmas crap, and then we went to the pub and had a drink and it just felt so right, and Fa got on with everyone so well, and she just fitted, and it was perfect, and i was happy, and we went home and passed out on my mums new couch

So she decided to stay for a few days, and my mum and steve bought her a little present, and then i had to go down to Fa's for a day to see everyone and spend some time with them, and that was fun, and we had a mad day, and i attacked her brother a lot on the playstation and everyone was happy and it was christmas

CHRISTMAS EVE

Went back from Fa's and got home, and then watched lots of TV and sat and drank lots of booze, and then passed out after writing the last LJ post

Christmas DAY!!!

Spent it with all the family, and it was great everyone was sat around drinking and there was a big mufaff because steves sister turned up really late and my mum couldnt keep the chicken warm any longer and everyone was in a mad rush just to eat, but i got lots of pressies so i was sat around playing around with everything, and steve went absolutly potty about his scalextric and everyone was happy. Christmas night was spent playing drinking games with steve and my uncle russ, and i was winning and then we got so drunk that we ate the remainders of thbe christmas food and much fun was had by all

Boxing Day

FA CAME FOR A MEAL THAT MY MUM INVITED HER TO, and she met steves mad family who also loved her and we played around with the kiddies and steve went to work and ricky bogged off to old trafford and we all sat around and watched as man utd kicked everton in and we had lots of a fun and sang lots of songs about scousers being hurt.
We then had a big christmasy meal with fa and it was great, it was proper family sort of affair and fa was now part of it, and i felt that we have such a big thing and that i really love her and that i want to spend the rest of my life with her and i cant imagine this ever ending and never ever want it too !

The week carried on pretty much as we had left it, we spent a lot of time with my mum and steve, and they took us out for a meal, and again fa just fit in and we were all talking and making friends and we had mini conversations between us and my mum and fa were talking about boots and everything was just on the up and up, this relationship just keeps getting better with every second i spend with fa.

We then left to go to fa's house for the new year, after spending nearly a week at my house

We went to see lord of the rings with her sister and brother and i was mightily impressed, and felt all big daddy with all the kiddies and fa as the mummy and it was great and again i had one of those ""I LOVE FA"" moments, which seem to be happening far to frequently over the holidays, well not far to frequently because i just cant get enough of it all

BUT

We then went out for the new years party that her aunt was putting on and we had lots of drinking and i was force fed and forced to drink by her mentle mummy, who is lovely, and fa seemed to reckon that the liked me and it was all good, and again i just fitted right in, its like a jigsaw puzzle that fits so well, and is really easy to finish, Fa is the biggest piece of my life, and on every side she fits in with such ease, and i love it, and its warm, and i dont want to loose it.

So then new years eve we left the aunts and made our way to Fa's house, in this mad blizzard and we had to leave the car at the bottom of the hill and i had to drag all the presents up the hill and i was going to get into a fight with a bunch of scallies but was far to engrossed in the new year cheer and just left them be.

Then new years day we built a snowman, and i went home for a lovely meal and it was all super duper, and it was all very nice.

The weekend that followed fa was going to stay with me, and she did, and we went to manchester with <lj user=graium> and had a lovely meal which i didnt pay for, actually no one did cause we did a runner and it was really good, but i drank far too much saki

Then..........i buggered up, big style

The next day was possibly the worst felt pain that i had ever gone through as fa wanted to finish it and i was never going to be the same without her, i love her so much and to loose her would just totally destroy me, and it did, i was a wreck and oober wreck and i couldnt cope with the pain, i spent the best part of an hour curled up in a ball crying and almost not breathing for some of it, i was breaking in half, someone was ripping the big piece of the jigsaw out and it was cutting deep and i was falling apart

Then by some surreal act of god, she had the kindness and lovelyness to give me a chance, i havent a clue how i got that chance and i will never ask anyone why cause i dont want to question it, but i am so lucky, so lucky to have her, i proposed that i would proposed (making us engaged to be engaged) and i mean it,

I want to spend the rest of my natural life (and hopefully my everlasting soul) with Fa

Happy holidays !"

I've just discovered that my <a href=""http://www.o2.co.uk/"">favourite mobile phone network</a> has no concept of bank holidays, therefore the calls I made before 7pm on Christmas Day have been charged at peak rate (40p/min) rather than off-peak (2p/min).

Call me naive, but I thought the idea of peak/off peak was to separate personal/home callers from business users, and I don't recall Christmas Day as being a work day for most people. It would be nice if the tariff information pages on their website actually worked, rather than leading to dead links, too.

This really is meanness taken to ridiculous extremes. Merry Christmas, Mr Scrooge. I think they deserve an extra-special Christmas card."

Personality type: Slimy, uncommunicative, know-it-all, indecisive, egomaniac, fuckwit.

 
Slimy
You think of yourself as a Ladies' Man (or equivalent for your Gender/ Preference). However, in reality the best you manage is meaningless sex with depressed people who feel sorry for someone even more pathetic than they are.
 
Uncommunicative
You find it impossible to express your true feelings or emotions. Your friends (if you have any) think you are a liar, an unfeeling bitch/bastard or retarded. Probably all three.
 
Know-it-all
You think you know everything. You got a few good grades in irrelevant subjects at High School and you think you are qualified to do brain surgery. If you're so smart, why aren't you rich and happy?
 
Indecisive
You are unable to do anything without whining about it for hours first. The biggest achievement of your day is probably managing to fill in all the questions in this test.
 
Egomaniac
You have a bloated self image. Somehow you think you are more than the web surfing loser the rest of the world sees you as.

Yes, it really is as bad as I've described it.

I've always had my suspicions about Amazon reviews. How do they, or could they, filter out positive reviews from people associated with the products? Suppress negative reviews from competitors?

Well I'm neither, just a rather unsatisfied customer with this particular product. Given that this disc has presumably been on sale for years and I've written the only review so far, the odds are that no-one will write another review for some months, if ever. So if I find an innocuous positive review that seems to put a better light on it I'll be highly suspicious.

<lj-cut text=""Complete review for posterity"">
 Nostalgic but useless, 17 December, 2002 

Reviewer: Adrian Short from London, United Kingdom
Greenstreet's 10,000 Photos Volume 2 is like a trip in a time machine. My suspicions were aroused before the shrink-wrap even came off the box as I read the minimum system requirements (486 processor, 4 MB RAM, 12 MB of hard disk space) and something about installing it under Windows 3.1. Who on earth has a 486 these days? Windows 3.1?

What's wrong with this disc?

Anything technical aside, the photos are average at best. They're not the kind of thing you'd find in a good quality publication. They'd do credit to a casual amateur photographer, but not a half-decent professional. Mostly they're obvious, conventional views of well-known landmarks, landscapes, animals and people. One or two pictures stand out as strong images, but otherwise they're nearly all ""so-what?"" shots. It's a car, it's a tree, it's a man, it's a field, it's the Taj Mahal again and again and again. So what?

Nothing is captioned. For many of the generic shots this isn't a problem, and most of us can identify the Statue of Liberty, the Taj Mahal and Big Ben. But for some of the other pictures it's annoying. They could be of some use or interest if you knew where they were, but you don't. All the pictures have filenames like P086A050.JPG and there's no other supporting information about them.

Things get worse when you look at the technical quality of the pictures. How do they get 10,000 photos into 553 MB of disc space? By making them low resolution and then JPEG-compressing them to death. Each picture is around 900 pixels on the longest side and takes up 40-60 KB of disc space. In practice, this means that they're not even acceptable screen resolution, let alone something you could print. They've probably used something like 50% compression on these images which is way, way too much, even for the web.

On that famous twin towers shot, the clear blue sky above Manhattan is streaked with obvious bands of differing shades of blue rather than a smooth gradient transition, and the buildings have that characteristic blurry ghostly shadow around their edges you get when you compress too much. They're not even remotely sharp. All the other pictures are similar.

Don't be fooled that you can export these images into a number of different file formats. You can, but it won't improve the quality. Saving a 60 KB JPEG as a TIFF isn't going to make it printable at anything more than credit card size, if that. Quality can't be added, only taken away, and most of these images' quality was taken away when they were compressed. Anyone could take pictures with better resolution and sharpness using even the cheapest and most basic of today's digital cameras.

This disc could be improved if you had a tenth of the images at ten times the quality. The vast majority of them aren't worth keeping anyway. But it's the prospect of such a huge selection that sells - it fooled me. I wish I'd done the maths first and worked out just how small and low quality the pictures would have to be.

What's good about this disc? There really are 10,000 photos here and there's a smiley face on the cover.

Back in 1995 this disc would have impressed anyone, almost just for being there. It's probably that old. Now, like the twin towers, it's history. It belongs in a museum, not on the virtual shelves of any self-respecting online shop. Nostalgic but useless.

The activists have positioned themselves on rooftops around the site but have not entered any buildings and do not plan to interfere with the operation of the plant. 

The occupation is part of Greenpeace's ongoing campaign to persuade the British government to abandon its nuclear programme and replace it with safe, economical, renewable energy sources such as offshore wind farms.

Greenpeace say that forty wind farms off the coast of East Anglia could produce as much electricity as all the nuclear power stations in Britain, while the government continues to use substantial sums of taxpayers' money to support the near-bankrupt nuclear power industry.

""I simply can't overstate the importance of Wired News' new design,"" said Eric A. Meyer, standards evangelist for Netscape Communications, a W3C member and author of several Web design books.

I'm not too sure about that. Sure, writing valid code <em>is</em> quite a departure for many large sites, but there's really no reason why it should be. And the standards with which they're complying - XHTML 1.0 and CSS 1.0 - are years old and can hardly be considered technology breakthroughs in their own right. Good designers have been writing <a href=""http://validator.w3.org/"">valid</a> code for years and clued-up managers should be in the habit of insisting on it before any pages go live to the web.

While I'd be the last one not to congratulate Wired for getting it right at last, the new site hardly constitutes the groundbreaking, web-leading development they're making out. The design is effective and functional while also communicating Wired's distinctive style, but there's nothing here that's new to anyone with a solid grounding in W3C standards, accessibility and content management.

A better headline would have been ""Wired News catches up at last""."

"event","<a href=""http://easyspace.com/"">Easyspace</a> are now selling domain registrations with a whole variety of suffixes like .shop, .chat, .mp3 and the obligatory .xxx.

Where did these new top-level domains come from? Certainly not from <a href=""http://www.icann.org/"">ICANN</a>, which was the only body authorised to create new TLDs the last time I checked.

It turns out that these new so-called domains are provided by <a href=""http://www.new.net/"">New.net</a>, whose mission is apparently to ""to build the Internet's leading market-driven domain name registry business by selling domain names with logical, easy-to-remember domain name extensions that make the Internet easier to navigate"". In English, they want to try to make vast sums of money by setting up their own private domain system while at the same time confusing the general public about how the whole thing works.

Last time I tried, the Internet wasn't that hard to navigate. The parts that were were due more to crappy web design than a lack of decent domain names.

Opening up the DNS with new TLDs isn't a new idea. Several rebel DNS systems like <a href=""http://www.opennic.unrated.net/"">OpenNIC</a> have been around for years. Like New.net, they work by positioning themselves above the root domain and mapping all existing ICANN-sanctioned Internet addresses beneath themselves.

For this to work, client machines and networks have to be reconfigured with the IP addresses of the new system's name servers. Logically, the domains in the alternative DNSs aren't visible to anyone who hasn't configured their machine or isn't connected via an ISP that supports it.

In a nutshell, Easyspace is on very thin ice selling domain registrations that aren't really true Internet domains and aren't visible to everyone on the net. In practice, they are just mapped as subdomains of new.net, so if I register cop.shop it's really just the subdomain cop.shop.new.net. Frankly I'm not paying $30 for that.

By promoting the New.net domains alongside the standard ICANN ones with very little clear explanation of exactly what the customers are getting, Easyspace is at best misleading their customers and at worst defrauding them. New.net domains aren't Internet domains and shouldn't be sold as if they are."

But I draw the line at endless stupid messages telling me that my ""Internet connection is not optimised"" (don't you believe it), that my machine is at risk because my IP address is being broadcast, etc. etc.

People that create banners that mimic dialog boxes and other UI elements are sadder than Mr Glum at his mother's funeral. Please, please, desist. Tricking people isn't a long-term business plan.

Worst of all are the banners that blink erratically in an epilepsy-inducing frenzy. I'm not epileptic but I find them almost impossible to tolerate on my screen. Normally I immediately scroll them off the top - is that what the advertisers want?

""If this box is flashing you've received an important message."" Please fuck off. Don't insult my intelligence. Am I meant to be <em>buying</em> something from these people? I wouldn't let them wash my windows, no pun intended.

When I first read Neal Stephenson's <a href=""http://slashdot.org/books/99/10/18/1049244.shtml"">Snow Crash</a> (1990?) the back-cover blurb promised a dystopian near-future where ""advertising space is sold by the pixel"". It sounded fairly cool back then. No-one realised how the web would drag the often quite subtle craft of advertising into the gutter in a frantic race to the bottom.

I hope it won't be long before the ad men and the cretins that come in their wake desert the net for good. Things are going that way. One way or another, companies providing valuable web services are just going to have to charge their customers for them. If the punters aren't prepared to pay, then either the service is no good or the company hasn't worked hard enough at establishing its <a href=""http://www.themanagementor.com/EnlightenmentorAreas/mrkt/Cbmr/Customer2.htm"">value proposition</a>. Anyone can find millions who'll flock to a service that's free. <a href=""http://www.scottmccloud.com/comics/icst/icst-5/icst-5.html"">Micropayments</a> will help and are long overdue. The <a href=""http://w3.org/"">W3C</a> has spectacularly failed to ""lead the web to its full potential"" on this one.

I'm just starting a web service of my own. You get a short free trial period, and after that it's pay up or piss off. No sponsors, banners, or other nonsense. If you like it and you want to use it, you pay for it. Why not?

In the meantime, I'm running Yahoo Mail with the graphics turned off. It takes care of the banners, but some alt text on those images would have been nice. It's the only way I can tolerate it. Graphics on/off is just a single key press (G) in <a href=""http://www.opera.com/"">Opera</a>. Lovely.

"event","Online billing rather than getting paper bills in the post is a great idea, and makes sense for all kinds of services, particularly telephones where the call log can be usefully manipulated in various ways to produce useful information.

However, I've recently made the mistake of moving my mobile phone onto an account with <a href=""http://www.o2.co.uk/"">O2</a>. This is an online-only account, where everything is self-service through their website, unless you want to call their premium rate customer service line.

This would be fine. I have a fast, permanent connection and am pretty good at understanding websites.

However, the thing just doesn't work. It's always been temperamental since back when it was Genie and I used to use it for the free text messaging service.

So I log in, it accepts my password. Then it asks me for my phone number so that it can show me my bill. I've no idea why it asks this, surely they know which numbers are associated with my account, and it doesn't really provide any extra security.

But when I type my number it just dumps me back at the log in page, with no error messages or anything else.

So it's come to this. I now have to pay 50p a minute to phone someone up and tell them that their website doesn't work - and presumably get patronised by some idiot that just assumes that I don't know what I'm doing.

I should charge <em>them</em>."

"event","I've just created a custom <a href=""http://avantgo.com/"">AvantGo</a> channel for my LJ friends so that I can read their posts on my Palm. Ok, I only have one friend right now, but it's a cool idea.

I must give the PalmOS/AvantGo <a href=""http://www.pocketlj.com/"">LJ client</a> a try, too.

I've also just noticed that AvantGo are limiting free users' channels to a maximum of 2MB. If you want 8MB of channel data, they're charging $20 a year. Hmm. I always wondered how long it would be before they started doing something like that.

I just hope <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/index/platforms/0,3109,342891,00.html"">The Guardian</a> don't start charging for their channel as a premium service. It's great to be able to read the whole paper every day, free."

Coming clean after all these years, he has described it as the thing in his life of which he was ""most ashamed"". So rail privatisation was a success then?

Whatever next? Michael Ancram and Margaret Beckett caught behind the Westminster bike sheds with ten Marlboro Lights and a three-pack?

"event","Telewest sent me my phone/cable modem bill this morning. While this is rarely welcome, it was good to see that they now offer an online billing service, allowing you to view and pay your bills online rather than receive dead trees through the post.

You have to register online and then wait for a PIN in the post, so I haven't had the chance to use it yet. I really hope they've applied some imagination to this and will allow you to sort the call log by dialled number, time, cost, etc., and view grouped summaries.

At least if they haven't, now the framework's there they can always add it in.

Even better, if they can be persuaded to provided a web services interface to their database, I can build my own views from it. That would be very cool. I wonder if they're going to do progressive usage too, rather than just monthly bills.

How long before I can log in to my own intranet and see the cost of the calls I've made so far this month?"

"event","Rich UIs are something of a web developer's holy grail. HTML was designed for marking up documents, not providing an interactive application interface. Given that, web forms and tables have done surprisingly well as a front end for many uses. However, just try dragging and dropping, resizing table columns, sorting objects, etc. HTML just won't cut it for more complex apps that require more than form filling. Web-based mail clients are notoriously clunky.

Right now I'm using a Windows client to submit this LJ entry, not the web form. It's faster and easier, once you have the thing installed, of course. While there are LJ clients for just about every platform imaginable, that's a testament to the widespread use of LJ itself. All those clients still had to be coded individually, and they still have to be downloaded and installed on every machine that people want to use them on.

So what we want is a system that gives us fast, rich UIs that run on every platform.

Java promised us ""write once, run anywhere"", but they never standardised a decent UI toolkit. It's hugely popular for application engines, but not for front-end work.

Flash MX has been oriented towards application developers now, as well as the usual design and animation types. However, it still lacks decent programmability, it's expensive, and it's hugely complex. While I detest the widespread abuse of Flash by designers, I respect the fact that people that can use it well are highly skilled. But I want to write my apps in a text editor, not arse around on a Flash timeline. Flash really wasn't designed for app development, no matter how much they tweak it. Besides, the thing costs over &pound;400. Sod that.

Mozilla's <a href=""http://www.xulplanet.com/"">XUL</a> is an interesting idea. This is an application framework that lets you write cross-platform applications that run in the browser. The functionality is very good and it's reasonably straightforward to work with. The only problem being that every client needs the Mozilla browser to run those apps. No chance.

This leaves me with the XML Windowing Toolkit, <a href=""http://www.xwt.org/"">XWT</a>. This uses an ActiveX or Java client and an XML and JavaScript zip archive containing the relevant UI description. The client communicates with your back-end server application using standard web services (XML-RPC or SOAP) calls. You don't need any tools other than a text editor and zip archiver to use it. It's open source, and it's free. It rocks.

I've been playing around with it and hope to have my first app online soon.

Check out XWT's <a href=""http://xwt.org/demos.html"">demo apps</a>. The chess game and mail client are particularly impressive."

"event","Saturday was the <a href=""http://www.stopwar.org.uk/"">demonstration</a> against the proposed war on Iraq. I didn't go, but it was good to see the huge numbers of people that turned out. As always there was a lot of dispute about the figures, with estimates ranging from around 150,000 to 400,000. Either way, it was a fantastic showing.

For once, the majority of public opinion is actually against military action, though I suspect for most people it's because they don't see the relevance or potential threat, rather than because they have a more sophisticated view of the situation in Iraq or any consideration for the Iraqi population. Either way, it's better than an unquestioning hostile stance.

A good introduction to the history and politics of the situation is Michael Manville's <a href=""http://www.freezerbox.com/archive/article.asp?id=225"">article</a> on Freezerbox."

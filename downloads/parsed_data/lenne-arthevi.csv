But you need to <b>stop</b> telling the world <b>our</b> problems. Or at least stop only telling your side.

Sorry, Aaron. Nothing against you, just what you're saying. :)"

If you happen to come across this someday, Alyne. Please know and understand I'm sorry. I'm not asking for forgiveness, because I don't deserve it. I just want you to understand how incredibly sorry I am is all. And I love you like mega-tons. Still. ._.

"event","Someone make me happy again.
I hate being low.
The mistake that I am.
Everyone tells me so.

Someone call me sweet.
And open up my eyes.
Because everyone seems to hate me.
And they think I don't try.

Someone lay me down to rest.
Because I'm weary of these streets.
My mind is bent into funny ways.
And I can't stand your fake treats.

I'm calling you.
Please dear god help me.
Because these simple days I can't make it on my own.
I'm so scared I don't want to leave..

--------

""Hurricane""

Shake down <b>you make me break</b>
For goodness sake
I think <b>I'm on the edge</b>
Of something new with you
Shout out don't drown the sound
I'll drown you out
You'll never screan so loud
As I want to <b>scream</b> with you

Standing there with your smile blinding
Your eyes from seeing
My face as <b>I'm dying</b>
To figure out a girl
But she drifts so far away
I'm on her coast
So maybe I should stay
And map around your world

[Chorus]
So Don't Say
""These currents are still killing me""
And you can't explain
But the wind went and pulled me
Into the hurricane

Stand up don't make a sound
Your ears might <b>bleed</b>
There are sweet flourescent enemies
That live <b>inside</b> me
The world moves faster than I knew
Not fast enough to not creep up on you
And the <b>space</b> we put between
<b>So pull me under your weather patterns</b>
Your cold fronts and the <b>rain</b> don't matter
Because a sun burn's what I needed

[Chorus]

<b>You don't do it on purpose</b>
But you make me shake
Now I count the hours 'til you wake
With your babies breath
Breathe symphonies
Come on <b>sweet catastrophe</b>

Well, maybe this time I can follow through 
I can feel complete
Stop paying dues
Stop the rain from falling
Keep my ocean calm
This time I know nothings wrong

[Chorus x2]"

"event","I was freaking out at Scott and Sara's house today.

Rachel, my niece, went upstairs to see my mother. Then she came to run back downstairs.. and fell. She fell all the way down the stairs, just flipping. Doing summersaults al lthe way down. Then half way down she landed straight on her head, and bounced back down. And landed on her back.

I was so god damn scared. I ran to her, picked her up and started hugging her and crying. She was screaming and trying to cling to me but my mom wanted to take her away and ripped her from me. I ran upstairs with her. I was so scared she was seriously hurt. It's a miracle she isn't. And my god, I'm so happy she isn't.

Thank god. But we still don't know for sure. She can move, though. Meaning she isn't paralized. But she may have other problems.

Dear god, he never did anything wrong. Please don't punish her.

It's all my fault. I should have been watching her. I didn't even lung to try and catch her. I just watched her go down. I had time to run and get her.. but I didn't. And she could have problems because of <b>me</b>..."

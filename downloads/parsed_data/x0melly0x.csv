"" is this what i really want to do for the rest of my life?""&nbsp;<br /><br />has everyone had a day or something where they just wonder what if i didnt' ..... or what if i changed so and so.. cuz i am kinda feeling like that... i mean what if i didnt move out of rez, would i be as happy as i was? i dont know its just something i consider, if i am making the right choices in life.....<br /><br />&lt;3</font></p>"

To drop the worst lines
You almost made me cry again this time
Another false alarm
Red flashing lights
Well this time I'm not going to watch myself die
I think I made it a game to play your game
And let myself cry
I buried myself alive on the inside
So I could shut you out
And let you go away for a long time

(Chorus)
I guess it's okay I puked the day away
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way
And if you want me back 
You're gonna have to ask


I think the chain broke away
And I felt it the day that I had my own time.
I took advantage of myself and felt fine
But it was worth the night
I caught an early flight and I made it home

(Repeat Chorus)
Nicer than that (2x)

With my foot on your neck
I finally have you
Right where I want you (4x)

(repeat chorus)
Nicer than that

I guess it's okay I puked the day away. (Nicer than that)
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way.(Nicer then that)
And if you want me back, 
You're gonna have to ask 
Nicer than that
Nicer!
Nicer!</pre>"

Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.
So I took what's mine by eternal right.
Took your soul out into the night.
It may be over but it won't stop there,
I am here for you if you'd only care.
You touched my heart you touched my soul.
You changed my life and all my goals.
And love is blind and that I knew when,
My heart was blinded by you.
I've kissed your lips and held your head.
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
I know you well, I know your smell.
I've been addicted to you.

<strike>Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me</strike>.(x2)

I am a dreamer but when I wake,
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.
And as you move on, remember me,
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.
I've watched you sleeping for a while.
I'd be the father of your child.
I'd spend a lifetime with you.
I know your fears and you know mine.
We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
<strong><em><u><font size=""2"">And I love you, I swear that's true.
I cannot live without you.</font></u></em></strong>

<strike>Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.</strike>(x2)

And I still hold your hand in mine.
In mine when I'm asleep.
And I will bear my soul in time,
When I'm kneeling at your feet.

<strike>Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.</strike>(x2)

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.(x2)</font></pre><br /><br /><br /><font size=""3""> </font></sub></font></pre>"

Honey why you cryin
Is everything ok
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud
Well my girls in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice
Sayin my name 
It sounds so sweet
Comin from the <strong><strike>lips of an angel<br /></strike></strong>Hearin those words
It makes me weak
And I
Never want to say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the <strong><strike>lips of an angel<br /></strike></strong>It's funny that you're callin me tonight
And yes I dreamt of you too
Does he know your talkin' to me?
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think she has a clue
Well, my girls in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice
Sayin my name 
It sounds so sweet

Break me down 
You got a lovely face 
We're going to your place 
And now you got to freak me out 
Scream so loud 
Getting fucking laid 
You want me to stay 
But I got to make my way 
Chorus: 
<strong><u>Hey! 
You're a crazy bitch 
But you fuck so good I'm on top of it</u></strong> 
When I dream 
I'm doing you all night 
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on 
(Repeat Chorus) 
Take it all 
The paper is your game 
You jump in bed with fame 
Another one night payed in full 
You're so fine 
It won't be a loss 
Cashing in the rocks 
Just to get you face to face 
(Chorus x2) 
Get the video 
Fuck you so good 
Get the video 
Fuck you so good 
<em>Crazy bitch 
Crazy bitch 
Crazy... bitch</em> 
(Chorus) 
<strong><u>Hey 
You're a crazy bitch 
But you fuck so good I'm on top of it</u></strong> 
When I dream 
I'm doing you all night 
Scratches all down my back 
Come on! 
Baby girl 
You want it all 
To be a star you'll have to go down 
Take it off 
No need to talk 
You're crazy but I like the way you <strike>fuck</strike> <strike>me</strike>! 
(Chorus x2) 
You keep me right on 
You're crazy but I like the way you <strike>fuck</strike> <strike>me</strike>!</font></pre>"

Distracting myself from your stare
And I've seen this mistake once before
With your games I will never fall for
I've hung up my guns
I won't kill again
I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
But I'm tired of lying
Tired of fighting you
And it's not gonna change
You asked for my heart
You know that I'm down 
But not the way you lie to me and tear it all apart
And beg for me to stay
I've sailed off to sea
I'm not coming back
I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
But I'm tired of lying
Tired of fighting you
And it's not gonna change
Counting down
Make that sounds
When you know it makes no sense
Counting down
Till you mess around
When I know you can't ever change
Why am I trembling
Throw it overboard
When I'm ready to we'll progress
Counting down
Make that sounds
Break the silence
Pretend it's not forever
I'll pull myself together
I'll say that I'll forget her, I'll breathe
And I'll say she never hurt me
And look at it as learning
And laugh about the good and the bad
Because I won't live forever
We don't belong together
I know I'll feel better
One day when I can make it through
I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
But I'm tired of lying
Tired of fighting you
And it's not gonna change</pre>"

That's because you're a natural at seduction. You don't realize your power! The root of your natural seduction power: your innocence and optimism. You're the type of person who happily plays around and creates a unique little world. Little do you know that your personal paradise is so appealing that it sucks people in. You find joy in everything - so is it any surprise that people find joy in you? You bring back the inner child in everyone you meet with your sincere and spontaneous ways. Your childlike (but not childish) behavior also inspires others to care for you. As a result, those who you befriend and date tend to be incredibly loyal to you.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

"event","That..Kairi girl is very nice. I..I think I like her a lot. We went out yesterday and today. She's really sweet <s>and Roxanne isn't that sweet compared to her</s> and she's cool. She's fine with me skateboarding. Which makes me wonder how she, Bobby, and Pj would get along.

Which reminds me...Pj sent me a letter about what was up at home. He met a girl in a coffee shop named Lisa. She does some pretty cool slam poetry from what I hear. Bobby tried to hit on her and failed... he's losing his touch.

<s>Dad misses me. I really hope he doesn't show up here....</s>

"event","So. Boring. Here.

Ugh. I tried skateboarding through the halls but some guy yelled at me and warned me not to do it again. Why not? It's a faster mode of transportation?

Bah, this is stupid. I should probably head over to the park and hang out with some people who aren't as lame and slow. Though I should probably write to PJ and see what's up with him. I might have to try and get him into town for a small while. That'd be cool.

I'll go do that first. Until then? Peace."

"event","Ugh, it's late and you are all lame. The skate park closes at eleven on the weekends cause of curfew and I've got nothing else to do with my spare time. I'm prepared for school. I'm ready for a new year even if I'd rather be back home. <s>Then again dad's there...I like it here where he's not an embarrassment to me</s> 

I'll probably look around for good music before I head off to sleep. I think I'll hit the town sometime just to check it out since I'm not from around here. Hopefully I'll make it back alive <s>and with my dignity still intact.</s>

"event","I decided to read back on a few things cause I was bored. I mean what else am I going to do when I can't find any good places to skate?

That's besides the point. 

Anyway, so some of you did that whole ""ask me a question and I'll answer it"" thing? Well yeah that's what this is for. Ask me a question. I'll answer you honestly. <s>So bored...this is why I wish Bobby was here. Despite his obession with cheese....ew. Nothing thinking about that.</s>"

so please if you are a crazy fan who lurks on their myspace,or livejournal or whatever please do me and the world a favor and jump off a fucking roof top! in all seriousness the chances of you EVER meeting the guys is 1 in 371897549816517865716 so please quit calling yourselves mrs. ross or mrs. urie its not gonna happen! end of story and if you do meet them and talk to them they way you do on LJ they will run screaming because you are a god damn crazy person!

the end. please die now...."

But why i feel  horrible...he was on a date with girlfriend! so we leave to go to the hair salon to see if they have what he told me.....but whenn we got there i totally forgot the name he told me!!!!!!!!! so we were like ""okay lets just go back and ask the cashier at hot topic  he had spikey hair"" so on our way way back we saw ike amnd his girlfriend, so we stopped and  asked again only to cover our stupidity we asked where he buys it and how to spell it so we bought the right shit...i felt so bad i kept apologozing for bugging him again.....i mean his girlfriend must totally hate me! and i totally understand but she was so cool about it...i mean stephanie talked to her while i talked to ike...you really dont understand how horrible i feel...i really need to thank him when i see him at school next  *sigh* i feel so bad... funny thing though is he buys it at Mitsuwa which he thought i totally wouldnt know, But i do i go there all the time!!! sweet hair wax for me!!!"

<lj-cut>so today we were getting ready to leave and the teacher asked a kid to pick up a piece of trash. so when he went to do it all the girls around him were complaining cause it was a lolipop stick. Anyways as he was picking it up another guy mentoned that it had been in someone's mouth. the teacher told him to just pick up the other end, the second kid said that some poeple can put in in their own muth, to which the teacher replied ""yea sure who."" so the kid said he could and the teacher's response was ""and i'm sure you'll make someone very happy someday"" when I heard this i happened to be drinking my water so i sqeaked and covered my mouth sio the water didnt come out! the teacher then turned to me and asked why i was doing that i hesitently stuttered out a very quite ""nothing"" and he told me ""i just meant that he could eat all their sweets.....oh shit i just made it worse!"" the best part was i was the only person in class who laughed....i dont think anyone understood!</lj-cut>

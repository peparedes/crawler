I can't forget the past.

I can't get rid of those memories, the ones that automatically come back at the glance of a picture.  I have never felt a love for someone so complete that it hurts my soul.

"event","Today was bullshit.  I got up at 7 AM to get on a fucking plane at 10 AM and travel until 10:30 PM and I can't sleep now.  I just tried to reach out to one of my only friends to talk and she's too busy or too mad or too wrapped up in whatever she's doing to talk to someone who is ALWAYS there for her whenever she needs someone to talk to.

I fucking hate my life.  It makes me want to not meet ANYBODY because if someone you consider to be most sacred to you doesn't give you the time of day (or night in this case), what's the fucking point??  Is it to just be tortured by the feeling like no one will EVER care enough??

I have major emotional problems.  I feel ugly and worthless.  I've been resorting to prayer because I don't know what else to do.  I feel so uncomfortable with myself and so miserable most of the time.  It seems like my life is one big anxiety attack, just hoping someone will be nice to me, hoping someone will care about me, hoping someone will hold me, hoping someone will notice me, hoping someone will talk to me, hoping someone will kiss me, hoping someone will love me.  Because I'm too terrified of the rejection that has always followed me to even have the desire to approach somebody.  I am so disappointed and disillusioned and I feel like it would be better if I was never born.  I can't afford the drugs I need to keep me sane and nothing else seems to work.  Every day when I wake up I can barely move my stomach hurts so much.  All I have is this computer screen to write to for relief.  I cry every day over being lonely and feeling like my few friends would rather I just leave them alone or are too busy to talk to me, over every single person I've ever loved not loving me back, over the feeling like I can't eat or consume anything without it making me feel like shit.  I have lost my motivation to LIVE and instead just EXIST, in some dreary world where the weather is always TOO something and the food tastes good but feels bad and the TV & newspapers spew the same shit day after day and nothing ever relaxes me.  I know there are a lot of people out there that care about me but it doesn't seem like it most of the time.  I miss my Mom and Dad and days when everything was simpler even if it hurt just the same.  I need to be a ""man"" and not a little girl and show emotion.  I need to be strong and calm and let things roll off my shoulders.  I am hurting so fucking bad right now and I just don't even know how to start to relax.  Most nights I can't sleep, I lay awake thinking of all the terrible things from my past and wishing that I saw LIFE over EXISTENCE in my future.  I need to be put away, confined in some hospital where I can pay people to console me when I'm sad and fuck me when I'm horny and leave me alone the rest of the time.  I wish when people asked, ""How are you doing?"", I could say ""Fine"" without it being complete bullshit.  I just want to be happy.  I hate this.  I HATE THIS.

Yeah, I'm wallowing in my own self-pity and I am pathetic.  God, take me, I'm ready..."

To summarize:

I suck.  I'm lonely.  I want to die.  I can't die.  I'm going to the doctor.  I hope it will help me.  It won't help me.  I will continue to be lonely.  I will continue crying daily.  I will continue feeling like shit.  I will never find love.  I will die alone and broken."

The very first time I fell in love got my heart broken then people would say when I passed their way
""Theres a hot young man going there going there"" 
""An unhappy lad going there.""
Well one day my mother called me to here side said son ""why you so blue"".
""Mother I lost the girl that I love why wont you tell me what to do""
Mother wont you tell me what to do?
Well she said find yourself another girl who will love you true true true find yourself another girl.

"event","Just a few things Mr. Buush has done to fuck with our environment...

January 20, 2001 - On his first day in office, President Bush proposes opening the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling in order to reduce dependency on foreign sources of petroleum.

March 28, 2001 - The Bush administration pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, a global warming treaty agreed upon by 87 other countries.  With the U.S. as the world's number one polluter, the treaty was rendered nearly useless in the fight against global warming.  Bush has not offered a viable alternative to combat the reality of global warming.

May 17, 2001 - The Bush administration released its energy plan, which largely ignored developing new technologies toward renewable energy.  After months of secret task force meetings headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, environmental and watchdog groups sued for the release of the meeting minutes in an attempt to reveal the large industrial interests with their hands in the energy plan.  Cheney and the administration have refused to release the records, a court entanglement that continues to this day.

June 5, 2001 - The Bush administration seeks a plan to redraw the boundaries of the 22 national monuments created by President Clinton in order to open up public lands to oil drilling and mining.

June 19, 2001 - Despite climbing gas prices and an increasing share of the auto market being covered by gas-guzzling SUVs, President Bush refuses to seek new stringent fuel efficiency standards for automobiles.  Simply doubling the standard of 20.7 MPG to 40 MPG would save 15 times the amount of oil in the ANWR - - ANNUALLY!!

July 2, 2001 - The Bush administration opens up the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico to oil drilling.

August 22, 2001 - The Bush administration abandons Clinton's Roadless Area Conservation Rule and allows national forests to open up to roadbuilding and logging.

October 31, 2001 - Despite studies by the National Academy of Sciences stating the cancer risks of current arsenic-in-drinking-water standards, the EPA announces it will not reduce the standard from the Clinton-era decision to the recommended 3 parts per billion.

December 10, 2001 - The Department of Energy states it must no longer prove that underground rock formations at the long-term nuclear waste storage Yucca Mountain repository would prevent radioactive contamination.

January 8, 2002 - The Bush administration considers re-starting testing of nuclear bombs in Nevada.

February 4, 2002 - President Bush's proposed FY2003 budget cuts environmental spending by $1 billion.

March 18, 2002 - The EPA announces it will weaken clean-air regulations for coal-fired power plants and refineries by discouraging new government lawsuits against polluters and encouraging incentives for voluntary reductions in toxic emmissions.

April 19, 2002 - The Bush administration dumps top global warming scientist Dr. Robert Watson due to pressure from ExxonMobil and other fossil-fuel industries.

May 14, 2002 - President Bush signs a ""farm bill"" really designed to agribusiness and largely ignoring small and medium-sized farm workers.  Included is government funding of the cattle industry for its environmentally dangerous waste ""lagoons"".

May 16, 2002 - The Tennesse Valley Authority (the nation's largest power supplier) unveils a five-year, minimum $1.7 billion plan to restart the final inoperative nuclear reactor at a northern Alabama power plant.

June 13, 2002 - The EPA announces it will relax regulations on 17,000 of the nation's largest polluters regarding pollution-control equipment.

August 15, 2002 - President Bush announces he will be skipping the U.N. World Summit on Sustainable Development.  Replacing Bush will be Secretary of State Colin Powell."

My heart is shattered in millions of pieces and I don't know where to begin whenever anyone asks me ""What's wrong?""  I feel like a horrible person from the moment I wake up to when I go to sleep.  I have blown off most of my ""friends"" and those that are true to me I treat terribly.  I am just glad for them that I am leaving and they don't have to ever see me again.  I am kind of looking forward to being completely isolated and alone.  That way I won't be hurt by anyone and I won't hurt anyone.  Joy is fleeting; pain is prevalent.  At least for me.

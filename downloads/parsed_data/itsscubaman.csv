"event","So like usually when I don't go one this piece for like 2 weeks or so and I check it out there isn't really that many updates from anyone but today i check it out and there is like so many i gave up on trying to read all of them. Bravo to those writers and thinkers who decided to share their feelings. I got a new computer. It is a sight to behold. Its beautiful. I also purchased the most amazing van I have ever seen. It needs a back seat and a new blinker light in front but once i get those its smooth sailing. It's weird how usually I used to only notice God's work in my life when I would get stuff, much like now. But I have been paying attention to it way more lately so this stuff that he has so graciously blessed me with isn't even the best part. I would encourage all of you to not judge your relationship with God by how many troublesome times he gets you through and how many things that you think you need that he gets for you. Judge it based on all the other times when everything is normal but He still finds a way to make life incredible. I promise you that if want to you will see Him in every aspect of your life an it will blow you away how detailed and intricate he is with you and your life. He is very much in love with us and I really want to prove to Him that I am in love with Him."

So at least I have that. I also have an interview at best buy on Friday so hopefully I get that becuase working 50-55 hours a week doing manual labor has made me a better person and more physically able to do things but frankly I dislike not having time to sleep and play video games and stuff like that. I also think it worth mentioning that God has been constantly giving me an amazing life like every single second of every single day. Randi. Its all sooo good. Everyone better be coming to the Bradley Hathaway show at LP on the 24th of this month. Which is October. It doesn't matter where your at. Just be there. YEAH!"

I am not allowed to drive until I get a job and I was talking to my parents about it and my dad said I could probably get a job working where he works. I would be doing like hard labor outside for 6 days a week...but getting mad monies. It beats sitting in an office and maybe I will get a little exercise. Plus I think I get to drive around by myself all day which would be sweet. Plus i get like 400 or 600 dollars a week which means I will be able to save monies to get out of my house...which brings mer to my next piece of good news. I was talking to my friends who are real good kids and in a sick band called Elotheos who you should check out by the way, but we were talking and decided we were going to all get an apartment together sometime next year. Its like real now. I have never been closer to getting out than right now and it feels good. I miss my dog but it does not even feel like she is gone yet. I don't know but everything is working out and I love God for blessing me which such amazing people and other stuff in my life. Cast all your cares upon him because he is the only who can truly bear the burden. Praise Him for that!"

"event","Take the attitude of a student, Never be to big to ask questions, Never know to much to learn something new. The well-bred contradict other people. The wise contradict themselves.
Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood. Those who sleep with dogs gets up with fleas. Apparently there is nothing that cannot happen today. I knew my trainer believed in me and I couldn't let Him down. What I aspired to be and was not, comforts me. The plainer the dress, the greater luster does beauty appear. Hopes are planted in friendship's garden where dreams blossom into priceless treasures. Conscription may have been good for the country, but it damn near killed the army. People who have nothing to do are quickly tired of their own company. To get rich never risk your health. For it is the truth that health is the wealth of wealth. It takes a great man to give sound advice tactfully, but a greater to accept it graciously."

It wasn't really something I could identify with though. But it was good. Yesterday was a pretty good day for me. It was the first time in a while that I have had a day where I really honestly didn't not have anything to do. Not like in the boredom sense but like I had no where to be. No prior obligations. It felt good. The only thing i had to do was later one in the night at like 8 Tyler arrived and we recorded three songs. It was good times. We did that until about 1:30 2 in the morning and then I went to drop Zak off and hung out with him and Dan for a little bit. I got home at like 3:30 and started watching that movie and now here I sit. Its now 5:57 and I am watching the sunrise. It is weird to think about light and dark. Dark is the absence of light which makes light something...but what does light look like? Does it look like everything else? Its weird because when it is light out I can see everything and when its dark I can't see anything. Until my eyes adjust to it being less light than it was. But dark actually looks like something though. Like it looks more like a real thing than light does. Unless you look at a prism. I don't know. its madness but in a funny way it lest me know that there was a creator. Whatever. Maybe I should go to sleep. I guess I will try"

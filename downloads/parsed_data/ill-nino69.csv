But nooooooooo he just asked me why i used the manual signals instead of the usual ones.....i am thinkin in my head.... what a dumbass if i am usin manual signals its obviously because the signals on my car dont work.... but i just told him what happened and he looked at me kinda weird then he let me go...... then i got to my workplace and everybody was in such a good mood that they didnt even noticed i was late....... 2day wasnt just another day..... it was a very weird and interesting day...... Oh well right now i just want this week to go fast cuz im lookin forward the weekend...... im out now... ill write more later........PEACE!!!!!!!!"

I look back and it surprises me the fact that im still alive..... i should b dead by now!!!! Last nite i had dream and it kinda scared me........... i remember i was in the middle of nowhere and all of the sudden i c a road wit 3 intersections and as i was walkin towards the first intersection i saw a person crossin the intersection from the other side.. it was me.... and as much i try to talk to this person who looked exactly like me he didnt notice me i think he couldnt see me at all..... so i kept walkin next intersection the same thing and again i tried to get his attention and this time he looked at me wit a very creepy and scary smile on his face.... now this time i was runnin 4 my life cuz i thought he was gonna do sumthin to me... and i got to the last intersection and yeah the same exact shit happened only this time he actually saw me from far away and he was trying to warn me about sumthin and just when we were face to face he vanished into thin air......... Idk what this dream means but whatever it was it scared the shit out of me......... i guess it was just another dream but the only thing is i dont usually dream about stuff like that... and when i do it because sumthin bad is gonna happen... i just hope nothing happens and that everything will b alright.......

My sis was bleedin, she got some cuts on her arm so they took us both to the hospital. we spent like an hour and half in the hospital then we went back home...... I went up to my room and i felt like shit i slept like about 2 hours then my phone started ringing, it was my dad, i picked up the phone and i thought he was gonna go off on me....... but shockingly he didnt, he was actually supportin me.......... he told me not beat myself up, accidents happen and to try to get over it..... I felt better cuz i knew my dad had my back..... In the afternoon my sis asked me i wanted to go to a party wit her , i was not in the mood at all then my dad told me to go so i could have fun i try to 4get bout what happened in the mornin. We didnt have a ride and i asked my dad if he could take us, he said he was tired and gave me his carkeys....... another shocker... so we went and then my sis told me that the girl that i like was goin to the party..... I got very excited about it. Well so we were at the party and i saw that girl and started talkin to her, then i told her straight up that i liked her, i spent the whole night wit her, we were playin and teasin wit each other.....and now its official.... we are goin out, i knew she liked me ever since we met and i liked her too, but i had a girl back then and i couldnt do anythin but now im with her and thats all it matters,and i hope this one lasts longer ... I really love this girl... In general my day had its ups and downs but at the end it was all worth it. One of the shittiest days of my life turned out to be one of my happiest days after all!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","ok so there is a girl who i like and im pretty sure she likes me 2, ive been thinking about her lately but right now i dont wanna commit myself to a relationship cuz first of all im in school and i am always busy so i have no time except saturdays and sundays when i usually go out wit my cousin and/or friends, second of all it has been almost 2 months since i broke up wit my g/f and im still thinking about it so right now i just wanna give myself sometime to 4get about it, think about something else and just move on wit my life. But idk..... i might change my mind though, we'd probably be just friends...... wit benefits!!!!!!!!. Yesterday i had to go outside and shovel all the fuckin snow, it sucked cuz i was still sick, not as sick as i was a couple of days ago, and i was freezin my ass off and plus my car wouldnt wanna start which was great but i fixed it and now its fine.. I watched football the whole day, i was actually watching the playoffs and rootin for the pittsburgh steelers unfortunately they lost to the fuckin patriots... I hate them... and if ur a yankee fan u will understand y i hate the patriots so much. Hey but like they say there is no crying in football, I just hope the eagles beat the new england pariots in the super bowl. Thats it for today. PEACE & LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Im sick, ive been coughing and snezzing alot, i havent eaten anythin during the whole day, i think i have some type of virus, thats not good... Oh well hopefully ill get better cuz i wanna go out somewhere, i cant stand bein in this house anymore, id probably go somewhere but this fuckin weather wont let me and it sux but thats what u have to deal wit when u live in jersey. 4 some reason ive been thinkin bout my ex lately, like i wanna call her everyday but at the same time i dont. its weird i dont even kno what to do, she is cool and everythin but everytime i talk to her i just wanna tell her how much i still love her but theres sumthin inside of me thats stoppin me from doin it. Wow i guess i was definitely in love sumthin that i have never felt b4 but like they say great things come to an end eventually. I started readin the book that we r gonna use in school for terminology and boy it sux it has these weird and funny words that i never thought they existed, i wonder who the fuck came out wit these words, i bet it was one of those losers who have no fuckin life. 4 example who named that little blue pill viagra??? y didnt they just call it ""blue pill 4 ur boner"" instead, its easier to pronounce and people woulda understood what it was 4 so the doctor wouldnt have to bother explaining its use, dumb people!!!!!!!! oh well....... i feel drowsy i bet its that medicine im takin so ill see if i take a nap. PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Its been a while since i wrote an entry on lj, at least now im not gonna have share the same lj account with james..........fuckin dumbass. we had a lot of fun with our old livejournal account, but at the same time we got in a lot of fuckin trouble cuz of it. This is my own livejournal and i aint sharin it wit anybody. With that bein said lets move on shall we? I just wanna clear sumthin b4 i start, my bio is the one that i had om my old lj account(i just didnt feel like writing a new one.......... im a lazy fuck what can i say????) so some things have changed,i graduated from high school, im 20 goin on 21(Yes, i know im old) im workin and goin to school, still i dont have a g/f, i had one(whom i loved wit all my heart and soul) unfortunately we broke up and im not plannin on havin one, at least 4 now, cuz i wanna focus on school. From there everything its the same, i havent changed at all, im still the same guy and hopefully i wont change at least in the inside. I cant believe id forgot everything bout lj, its a good thing that i got it back cuz now i realize this is a good way to express my feelings, thoughts, desires and everything that i wish and hope for, unlike b4 when i thought it was just another way to fuck around wit people. Im actually goin through a lot of shit, my dad already warned me to stop bein a rebel or else im out of the house...... Thats bullshit, cuz he knows how i am, and i cant help it i just dont like to follow rules, so if u see me on the streets as a bum or a drug dealer dont be surprised........ Just kiddin. if he kicks me out id probably go back to el salvador  and take care of my grandma, i hope it wont go down that way.... ok so thats it for 2day, ill write more later, PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

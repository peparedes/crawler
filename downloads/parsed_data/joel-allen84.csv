I don't like my job that much anymore i really don't to much stuff going on. Well anyway after the parade i was ok then jenn f kept pissing me off all day long. Then beth started crying i thought someone died or something she wouldn't tell me what was wrong. I was worried she didn't talk to me or anything. She called home then left work after throwing the headset. I called her later to see what was wrong so she is ok now. I still don't know who left that comment on my journal about me and beth that really made me mad. I don't know any friends i had that would do that to me. Well i am going to go now ok Later....

"event","Thats right i am fucking bored again.  Well i guess i am always a lil bored. Sometimes i hate life a lil i am boerd with it. I still don't have my dl and i never have any money to do anything it sucks it really does. it seems like all i ever do on this journal is right about my probs and bad stuff that has happened to me befor. there isn't to may ppl i tell stuff to and trust them with it. One is Mysti i have told her a lot of stuff and i do trust her not to tell anyone else and if she ever did i would be really mad about it bc i trusted her. I have also found out that there isn't to many ppl you can trust some ppl trust me and some don't. But thats the way it is. There are also ppl that act like your friend but really they are just being nice to you so they wont hurt your feelings. sometimes i get sad a lot but thats about it mad and sad. There are a lot of ppl i don't like and there are friends that i use to have but no more maybe bc i haven't seen them in forever i don't know i have made new friends but they are not really friends. I also get made fun of a lot but mostly from the ppl i joke aroud with but sometimes i get tired of that. I try to be a nice person all the time but a lot of ppl just make me made and all i can do is yell at them. i try to be nice to girls all the time too but thats hard to do. Well anyway a lot of stuff doesn't bother me any more. Like when i am sad or something i don't show it or anything i just try to find something to do. the only time i really talk about stuff like this is really on this journal. Maybe there is something wrong with me bc of the way i feel i don't know. The things i hate in life is being a lone except the time i wont to be alone. PPl being mad at me and i don't know why or what i did. PPL picking on me about stupid stuff. But i am really tired of things like jennifer at work she yells at me everytime she comes in to work and i have no idea why she is yelling. I thought we are friends or something like when she comes in why not say hi joel whats up or are you haveing a bad day or something. No she comes in and starts yelling not to many ppl there like her they just put up with her. i think she is alright as lone as she stops yelling at me or something but she is always in a bad mood. Then jessica at work she has always been my friend and she is nice to me so she is ok we talk about a lot of stuff and right now in her life something big is going on and i still can't believe how calm about it she is. Same way for beth she is ok at times but she gets in her moods at times too. I just need something in my life to happen and i don't know what i want to happen. well i am going to go i am kinda tired now so later"

I dunno i must not be cool or a nice person bc all of me friends are gone or the new so called friends i got don't care about me or just want me for fun. Sometimes i just feel alone like there is no one to talk to or to be there for me like the only person that well be there for me is myself. But even if it is not true that is how i feel Alone. Sometimes i think no one likes me that i am just someone there for them not to be bored. But i dunno i feel stupid about the stuff i do. I really feel stupid when someone finds out how i feel. When i get sometimes i just try not to talk to ppl bc i well end up yelling at them and then there will be a fight and they wont want to talk to me. Just right now life sucks for me even if i act like it is all good i am not happy with it."

"event","Well i asked Anna today how she felt about me. She said she likes me but she doesn't want a bf right now. Why doesn't she want a bf right now i don't know she said if she changes her mind she would tell me. But was she being serious about likeing me or did she say that to let me down easy or what i dunno. I think i may love her i really dunno i think about her all the time even if she doesn't feel the same way to me. I am nuts over her and it sucks that she doesn't feel the same. I don't know sometimes i think it isn't worth it. I mean i want to be with her and all but if she doesn't want to be with me right now souldn't i find someone else. Thats what i think but then i think as soon as i find someone else she might want to be with me. Then i would have a prob. I also feel a lil stupid for likeing her as much as i do i have known her for like 6 months And i have liked her for maybe 5 of them. I am really shy about stuff and i also feel a lil stupid bc i am still a virgin and damn do i get made fun of about it. But anyway everyone there knows how much i care about her but still nothing is going to happen so i just have to stop trying and wait for her to change her mind about haveing a bf. OK well i guess i am done now leave a comment."

Well hey still need to get a damn car yeah i know damn joel you have had a lot of time to get one what the hell are you doing with the money you make at mcdonalds spending it on whores...... Well a lot of stuff comes up now and again and i help my mom out one time i gave her my hole check that was 350. But anyway i have my eye on 2 cars one is a 1990 dodge datona and i don't know what the other one is yet i have just seen it like 2 times but i like the way it looks and if i go look at it again i will see how it runs. but it is $1595.00 yeah i only have 850 but the other car is 700 bc it needs a fuel line and a battery and the guy knows me. So i dunno i can't do anything untill my mom gives the ok about it bcshe wants me to have a good nice car and i said ok about that. But anyway.... ok i got a question for you guys if you had a wish just one wish what would you wish for but think about it you can't change it and it will last for every like if you wished for immortality why i mean you would see pain and suffering for all your life forever. I dunno somethings you think will make you happy don't sometimes. Have you ever thought about your past like how you wished you could go back to a moment in the past and just do it all over again or just go back to relive that memory you will always have. Also think about this what if the person you love died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt or anyone to that matter. What if you went on in life not telling ppl how you felt about them tell it was to late. I mean its sad really ppl who you think are your really good friends may not be that of a good friend. But how will you know unless they tell you or you ask them how they feel about you. Have you ever had a time in your life someone died and you never told them how you felt or what you thought about them. I have and it sucks i also know someother ppl like that to i guess ppl just die sometimes and there is nothing you can do about it. Like the last time you saw them you had a bad fight with them and you said some mean shit and then they die and you can't do anything about it. Thats what happen to me and my grandpa. I never got to say sorry or anything to him and that happened when i was in like 8th grade. I never cried at his funeral i never cried for a long time about it. i forget what he looks like now bc i haven't got a picture my grandma does but me and her isn't in good moods right now. about the only memory of my grandpa is when we fought and him laying on the ground dead. But what am i going to do if my grandama dies the About 3 weeks ago i told her the only person i care about is my mom and pushed her out the front door i dunno what to do about her hell the only one to be there for me was my mom. Oh well i gtg ok later"

Ppl just don't care anymore about nothing. But there is nothing anyone can do bc ppl only care about there self and no one else as long as you are happy then fuck the world as long as you get what you want am i right. If you got a fucking problem with it who cares. But yet there are times when ppl would do anything for someone else. They would try to do whatever they could to make them happy and make sure they got what they want bc they love them. But you have to have a really stronge love for them to do that shit for them. alwas wanting to be with them wondering what the hell they are doing when your not with them. One thing else you can never have for another person is trust you basically can't trust anyone so there leave a comment if you want"

     Man you guys know what i am tired right now so i guess i sould just say some shit about how i feel right now huh. Well i dunno how i feel the baby steven is like can i hold him let me give him the bottle has the baby i mean he really cares about it but why don't i feel the same why do i have a hard tme trying to care about someone. I mean sometimes i just can't get close to ppl feeling wise. If someone treats me like shit sometimes i just say fuck it leave me alone and i well leave you alone and never again will we talk. But if someone makes me mad and i still talk to them or i care about them that is very rare. steven the only reason i still talk to him is bc he is my bro. my dad fuck my dad he could die i wouldn't care. i wouldn't even want to know. but the point is that i have trouble getting close to someone. I am not a easy person the get to know i am a very shy person to hell i want even talk to ppl i don't know unless i have to. But anyway i guess i am done so Later. Leave a comment ok Later all."

Most the time now i talk to anna and jessica they keep my mind off things and the time goes faster.  But i guess i make ppl laugh there or something bc when i start work i am always dead but later on in the day i guess i get worked up and i guess i just make ppl laugh.  Hell anna wants to work with me just bc i am funny and today the manager asked me if i could work some 7-3 i don't like that hour but who cares right i still get paid for it. So anyway i just don't give a fuck about what time i work but i would like it a lil better if i could work a lil later in the day with jessica and anna. but in the morning for breakfast there is fred and adam and a guy named billy who ius funny as fuck.  They talk about werid shit and some of it is gay but i guess we are to tired to care about what the hell we are saying.  Well anyway that enough about work what to say about other stuff.  Maybe i sould right shit about my self.

Oh and guess what I really want to go and stuff to college but yet i also want to stay i dunno anymore. Anyway i got something to say, there really isn't to many ppl that read this lj so i don't have to worry about someone reading something stupid i write so. Mysti hows it going that day you asked me if i was mad hell no why would i be i was just sad thats all. Your one of my good friends hell when i go to chris's house i usally talk to you. But i do like you and you know that and i guess nothing will happen between use now so i guess we well still be friends right..... Well anyway if cody reads this hey i am sorry so thats all i got to say to you. Back to this journal i just took steven to practice man he is a jackass. He makes me mad enough to where i want to kill him. i could do a good fight but then i would get tired after a half an hour or something and he would win then. I have also found out my brother doesn't trust me with a knife lol. He also doesn't like to trade punches or stuff like that. so yeah i really don't have anything else to say so later."

"event","Hey well today is better i guess life just hasn't been so grat lately. I need to get out more and do more stuff but i need to get a damn car. I guess lately i have just been really depressed about stuff but i don't know why. I have also dicided to write about stuff in my life on here so here it goes. Well lets see i really don't remember much about myself when i was a kid but i was told that i put a hot lightbuld on stevens neck and burnt the skin off (yeah i know ouch) but i was little and can't remember it at all. I was also told that one time i went to my dads house on a weekend that my grandapa on my dads side seat on the front porch with a gun in his mouth. But i can't remember that either i have been told that i have a memory block . That i block stuff out that i don't like. Well this next thing i do remember i was at my house when my grandama called about my grandpa on my moms side was hurt so we got in the car and went to her house as fast as possiable. Well when we got there my grandpa was face first in the dirt dead. his heart exploded and it really hurt me. he was basiclly the only one that cared about me but my mom. Well after he died My grandma on my dads side got cancer really bad and it went to her brain she started to go crazy in the end and she yelled at me about stuff i never knew about when i was only a lil kid and told me that i took her money and that i sould of been dead. Well it scared me sicne i was a kid and not to long after that she died. i didn't want to go to the funural but i had to too support my dad i hated going there. Well i stopped going to my dads and everything was ok for a while. but then one day my dad came down to my house to see me i was surprised i thought he didn't care turns out he was just going trough town to do bussiness with someone and anyway he came to our house and he was drunk i mean really drunk he said hi to everyone but me and talked about his new kid. Well it turns out that he didn't even know who i was he thought i was a kid around town and then he left and i haven't seen him since. Now don't get me wrong i don't car about my dad if he died tomorrow i wouldn't care i wouldn't even be at his funeral. Anyways though out my life i have helped out my mom a lot when we have had money trouble i gave her money and i still give her money today. After steven was born my mom married matt stevens dad and I hate him so much i could kill him and never think about it. I got my reason ashley w knows about it. anyway when my mom and him would get into fights i would have to stand up to him so he would either leave or settle down and shutup but i was about 7,8,9, something like that he could of hurt me bad but he never did. Well after my mom divorced him she meet tom, now tom is ok at times but he has slammed me against a wall and has also hit me but not in the face. But my mom and him has gotten into fights befor and he has never hit my mom but i have had to stop the fights befor and so has steven. I have also went to a therapist befor (i can't spell) i have had panix attacks or whatever and i did take medacine for it but i stopped on my own a long time ago. just decided to stop. Well i have been ok without the medicine but still at times i feel nevrous about stuff and things and i am a really shy person so that makes it worse. Now about steven yes steven is eptiltic he has sezures and the first time he had one it scared me i had no idea what happened to him. he bit his toung and was bleeding from that and it was in the winter with ice all over the roads so we pulled off the road and i had to run home and tell my mom to call for help well i never ran so fast in my life and i slide on the ice and bounced of a mailbox but i got home and we got him help. Now back to me i have went to 4 different schools i have went to new lex , crooksville, roseville, and philo. different schools suck. But anyway i never really had fun at school it wasn't hard or anything i just didn't like going all the time and i didn't have many friends. but around 5th 6th garde i made a lot of friends but still hated school. i have always been picked on but never did anything back. i have never had a best friend don't know why maybe bc i go to school in philo and live in crooksville and yes that sucks. The friends i have at philo hell i need a car to go see them and stuff whenever i get to use my moms car i have to give her money for gas. Oh and i forget who it was that asked me if i was going to kill myself no hell no but i have thought about it befor but i told melissa about why it is a fucked up way to die. My secerts lets see I have told secerts about myself to ashley,allison,sarah,mysti and i think thats it well most of them keep there mouth shut and thats good. i guess you can always use someone to tell your secerts to. hell i think they know about me then anyone else even whitney when we went out. Ok now i know i was stupid to go out with her and yes everyone said joel no she is to young in the begining but i liked her and she said she liked me. i wasn't really sure about the age thing so i told her that i was thinking about breaking up with her. So she goes and cheats on me with cody. Well i was told something that i am to tired to remember so i forgave her. We went out for a while and she broke up with me bc she said she didn't want her dad to find out but she also said that the guy she went out with that same day was ericas fault that she didn't know about it. Well a lil time went by and we got back together Well my mom found out and you know her the way she is at times called the police about use souldn't be together so i had to break up with her so either of use wouldn't get in trouble. well she went out with cody and after they broke up she went back out with me again for like a week then broke up with me for somereason i still do not know but stupid me since i loved her and cared about her so much even if she did treat me like shit went back out with her. We went out for a while and she ceated on me and dumped me and said i was a bore and she didn't care aout me that cody was there so she madeout with him or he fingered her whatever. i just thought she felt the same way about me as i did about her. and we went out off and on for lil over a year. what a fucked up year. i know who ever reads this is saying what a stupid asshole for staying with her that long well you don't know how i felt about her i loved everything about her i don't know why i just did. i mean all the small things she did when we were together that made me laugh just everything. so yeah i got over her dumping me but i will still have feelings for her even if i am a fucking boreing asshole that is to shy to do anything. Well anyway.........thats about my life it sucked. i guess the only thing now for it to do is to get better.  Well whats happening in the present futurecedar point trip for banp ppl is aug 13th i am going to go just don't know who i am going to hang out with while i am there. i will get paid the friday befor so i should have some money on me for it. i was suppose to walk around with someone else but things changed. Well i am tired and i am going to go to bed goodnight and plz leave a comment. i don't ever get anymore comments anymore. So later"

My secerts lets see I have told secerts about myself to ashley,allison,sarah,mysti and i think thats it well most of them keep there mouth shut and thats good. i guess you can always use someone to tell your secerts to. hell i think they know about me then anyone else even whitney when we went out. Ok now i know i was stupid to go out with her and yes everyone said joel no she is to young in the begining but i liked her and she said she liked me. i wasn't really sure about the age thing so i told her that i was thinking about breaking up with her. So she goes and cheats on me with cody. Well i was told something that i am to tired to remember so i forgave her. We went out for a while and she broke up with me bc she said she didn't want her dad to find out but she also said that the guy she went out with that same day was ericas fault that she didn't know about it. Well a lil time went by and we got back together Well my mom found out and you know her the way she is at times called the police about use souldn't be together so i had to break up with her so either of use wouldn't get in trouble. well she went out with cody and after they broke up she went back out with me again for like a week then broke up with me for somereason i still do not know but stupid me since i loved her and cared about her so much even if she did treat me like shit went back out with her. We went out for a while and she ceated on me and dumped me and said i was a bore and she didn't care aout me that cody was there so she madeout with him or he fingered her whatever. i just thought she felt the same way about me as i did about her. and we went out off and on for lil over a year. what a fucked up year. i know who ever reads this is saying what a stupid asshole for staying with her that long well you don't know how i felt about her i loved everything about her i don't know why i just did. i mean all the small things she did when we were together that made me laugh just everything. so yeah i got over her dumping me but i will still have feelings for her even if i am a fucking boreing asshole that is to shy to do anything. Well anyway.........thats about my life it sucked. i guess the only thing now for it to do is to get better.  Well whats happening in the present futurecedar point trip for banp ppl is aug 13th i am going to go just don't know who i am going to hang out with while i am there. i will get paid the friday befor so i should have some money on me for it. i was suppose to walk around with someone else but things changed. Well i am tired and i am going to go to bed goodnight and plz leave a comment. i don't ever get anymore comments anymore. So later"

Your birthday on the 29th adds a tone of idealism to your nature. 

You are imaginative and creative, but rather uncomfortable in the business world. 

You are very aware and sensitive, with outstanding intuitive skills and analytical abilities. 



The 29 reduces to 11, one of the master numbers which often produces much nervous tension. 

This is the birthday of the dreamer rather than the doer. 

You do, however, work very well with people.</td>

Tomarrow I have my English AP test. Boring. I don't have to do well, since it's my first time taking the test, but if I don't wanna take my English final, I gotta try. Then on Friday, I have my History AP test. Damn. I think I will do awesome on History, since I rule History's balls. Haha.

I went to the Pecan St. Festival yesterday. It was fun. I bought a pin that says ""I have my mother's eyes. They're in my pocket."" Dad said that was evil. Muahahahaha...I guess. Anyhoo, I am outtie."

He was talking about how we can't bring each other down by calling people of other races, and our own race names. He said that black people shouldn't call each other the ""n-word"" and whites shouldn't call each other crackers, at this point everyone is turned around looking at me, and how mexicans shouldn't call their race whatever they call themselves. The guy was all like, ""Let me see the black kids"" the whole auditorium raised they hands. He said ""Let me see the mexican kids"" more raised they hands. When he saud ""Let me see the white kids"", everyone looke at me, once again. I said aloud, ""Bitches, I ain't white."" Daniel was all like ""Then what are you then?"" I said ""I'm black, stupid."" EVERYONE busted out laughing. It was great.


On Saturday we are having a Bar-B-Que, and my mom invited Thea and her man-lover, ""Bear"". It is gonna be fun. I can't wait.

Man, ""Craig"" was im-ing me today. Why? I have no clue. He said something about a 91 Firebird or something, and how he bought it from Josh. I don't know. But then he brought up that day after X-Mas when Josh showed up at the mall when me and my brother was there. Why do people keep reminding me of the past? I am trying to forget the past and look on towards the future. 

Me and Jesse went to the mall today. It was ok. Jesse said she had to do my make up, which was fucking hell. I hate make up. I felt all wierd walking thru the mall with that face plaster on. Ewww. But my eyes looked pretty. Purple and red eyeshadow brings out me eyes I guess.

Today I found out that Jason went to Reagan on Frieday to look for me. We came in the cafeteria, during my lunch. He didn't see me though I guess. He told me all these people was mean muggin' him, so he felt wierd and left. So yeah. He skipped school to come see me, which didn't even happen. I need to talk some sense into that boy. LOL. 

But yeah. Prom is on the 21st, and I am gonna wear a tux. I can't stand dresses, and I don't think I would be able to stand being in one for 6 or 7 hours. So, I am wearing a tux. I am getting my hair cut off, it's ""pixie"". I think that is what they call it. Dunno. it is orange-red. I am getting my make up did as well. Mom said if I am going in a tux, my face better look decent. I can't wait to get shit-faced and party it up at either Owens on I-35 or Denny''s on I-35 off of St. Johns. Yeah bitches.


Well, I have to figure out who I am going to prom with. I think I am gonna ask out Jason tomarrow. Yay. I can't wait.

I got free coffee from TigerMart out of it. I was waiting in line, and when it was my turn, the chick was all like ""it that it?"" i was like ""yeah"". She was all like ""get out"". I was confused, but Mommy said we could go. I said we had to pay, and Mom sayed no. AWESOME. I burned my tounge.

Ohh, Jacob, or whatever, if you read this, I am glad you want me to go away. I didn't say I didn't care about Josh getting surgery, I said I didn't care because that is what I say when I don't know what to say. I'm glad Tammi thought I was being rude, here is what I e-mailed her. Not rude what-so-ever:

~~Umm, hi. I hope Josh get's better, I really do. Tell him I said that I hope he is doing ok, if you would.
 
 I don't really understand why you emailed me, since you were the one who wanted contact to stop. 
 
I hope y'all had a good Easter.
~~Sam

Now explain to me how the hell this is being rude. I was being sincere. Fuck y'all. Ohh, and Jacob, I don't hate gay people. It's kinda mean to hate your best friend, huh? Yes, my best friend is gay. Hard to believe, I know."

I haven't talked to nayone even closely related to your white family...except ""Craig"", but I doubt seriously it was Craig. I think it was Josh, but NOOOOO. It's never Josh, is it? Nope. Stick up for him. Let him be a mama's boy till you die. I don't give a FUCK!! 

Now that that is out of my head, I got a prom date. I am going with Thea. I am gonna get my dress and shit on the 3rd. Thea will wear a tux, just for me. She told me to tell my mom that we are lesbian together, and my mom looked at me like, ""Whatever, Sam."" We have been friends forever, though. But I think Prom will be fun with thea there. I love her more than i have ever loved anyone, including stupid boys. I love her like a sista. 

I'm out."

""Cold"" by Crossfade

Looking back at me I see
That I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in
Things I cannnot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Something strong
Like a drug that gets me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold to you

And I'm sorry about all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You could see me stand on my own again
Cause now i can see
You were the antidote that got me by
Something strong like a drug that got me high
I never meant to be so cold

I never really wanted you to see
The screwed up side of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me theres just no hope
I never meant to be so cold


This song is dedicated to my hair. I am sorry I have been mistreating you. I promise to wash you with better shampoo. I will no longer use White Rain, I know you hate it. I will only use TreSemme from now on. I apologize. I love you!"

Yesterday I was walking to the New Mall for lunch, and this freshman I know named Josh (what is the deal with me and Josh's?) asked if I had a cigarette, I usually give him one when I have some. I said that I had only one left. He begged for it so I told him to give me a dollar for it....And the dumbass gave me a dollar for a stale cigarette!! Haha. But Josh is cool though. I told him about me gauging my ears, and he said he would buy me the gauges past 10 because they expensive. I gotta get me some 12's though. Time to go to the mall and get my monthly 5-finger discount I guess.

Ohhh, Amy Santa Ana from my 8th grade year at Webb goes to Reagan now. I haven't seen her in about 4 years. SHe looks good, except for the fact that she hangs out with all the ""gang whores"". A gang whore, in case you don't know, is someone that screws a member of the gang to get in.

Oh well, Happy Birthday, you know who I am talking to.

Now for some of my favorite movie. Guess which one it is:

ROSE

Oh, Jack.

All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is further
away now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go.

She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason
to even try.

And then... her eyes snap open.

She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the
wood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boat
is invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She struggles
to draw breath, calling again.

292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to something
ahead, turning the tiller.

293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen to
Jack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclasps
their hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film.

                                   ROSE

I won't let go. I promise.

She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade out
like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane."

I don't care that I was with my sister and another guy(he shall remain nameless). I will always and forever love that movie. My friends think I am the female version of him, because of my sarcasm and the way I say certain things. I am always saying ""Gosh"" and ""Idiot"". Sometimes I even say ""Freakin'""....Like all the time actually. Every other word outta my mouth is either fuck, freakin, or dumbass. HAHA. 

I saw Troy as well. I don't think that was Brad Pitt's ass, buz I have seen him nekkid, and it doesn't look the same. It could be him, well I hope it is him. I love that movie. Brad PItt is HOT. I don't care if he is 40 something. He is hot. But not hotter than my man, Eminem. No one is hotter than him. Haha. That reminded me of something. One of my friends asked what ever happened to my ex that looked like Eminem. I laughed in her face, cuz I haven't dated anyone that looked even remotely like Eminem. AT ALL. Maybe it's a mexican thing. I don't know. 

I saw Chris in the office today after sixth period before I lfet school today. I glanced at him and he said ""What the hell are you looking at girl?"" I said ""Yo ugly face"". He walked away. but as I was aslking out of the office he was beside me. He said somethin like I ""...had better walk away or else"". Haha. I turned around and I tried to slap him, but he was too far away.

Today was a good day. No drama today.

"event","Well, I have decided to leave my beloved Reagan for McNeil. I have decided I need a better education. Oh how I love Reagan, but I am not learning enough to get me prepared for college. I need better teachers and better influences.


On a better hand, I am trying to get skinny. No food in 2 days, so I think I can do it. 

Anyways, I was at the busstop this mornin, and I was smokin a ciggie. Well this old man walked by, stopped in front of me. I had to put my head-phones down to see what he wanted. He took a drag from his ciggie, then told me smoking isn't healthy and I need to stop. I laughed in his face, then put my headphones back on. LMAO

Amanda told me some good news today, she screwed a virgin. LOL> He is a senior, and he told EVERYBODY that he lost it this morning. LOL. I laughed at her in her face when she told me at lunch today. She thought it was pretty damn funny too when the guy started makin out with her. He is four times her size. I'm suprised she didn't die from suffocation. Oh well, she did it, not I.

I am stressin out, PSAT scores come in Thursday. If i don't get above a 1240, I am dead. Thats what I got Freshamn year. My dad thinks I am so smart, and if I don't get above what I got last time, I am slacking off and I die. Well my IQ is 117, so I don't know why he is freakin out. Isn't 117 above average?

Oh well, I am tired."

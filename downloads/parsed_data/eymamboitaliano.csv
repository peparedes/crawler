Also, I rolled my ankle warming up, but walked it off, played 4 games, and now it's killing me.

"event","I have mixed feelings about today.  

It was, overall, an awesome day, I suppose.  This morning worked in the lab at 8.  So long as the lab grant goes through, I'll be getting paid next semester, as well as get a key to East Hall and the lab itself.  I'm real excited to become more independent in the lab, as today started the first of my own experiment.  I basically had to do everything by myself, which was crazy.  Today we ran IF2R Train Context A, which was one long session.  We had the rats in the boxes 78 minutes each, with 75 2 second shocks delivered every minute (with a 3 minute pretrial period).  Let me tell you, rats get real jumpy after over an hour of getting shocked.  This one was hopping around like mad woah..I couldn't stop cracking up.  This thing was flying across the box...I think I might've been a wee bit overtired too...but it was funny.  While the rats were training I got a brain sliced and analyzed data, I felt pretty accomplished by 11.  Also, to make the morning even better, Christine made an Espresso Royale run....mmmm coffee and cutting up rat brains.

I went to French like 20 minutes late because I felt like staying in the lab and analyzing data...but I made it to French eventually, and that's what counts, only time this semester I've missed/been late, and I didn't miss much.  Kat (sister, not polo) picked me up from MLB and we went to Panchero's for lunch.  It was quite the entertaining lunch, and she liked the ""Good Luck on the MCAT"" sign I made her with a bunch of Bavarian/Amish people on it. :)

Studied for chem in between lunch and english...got a ride to English from Kat (polo, not sister), only to find out that English is officially over and we just had to fill out evaluations and leave.  I'm hoping I'll have a lot of extra time since both English and Chem 125 are done for the semester, excluding final exam/paper.

Chem test tonight basically sucked.  I kept on getting real funny lewis structures.  I don't get it.  I studied so hard for that test..probably 25 or 30 hours when you add up reading, practice exams, practice problems, and office hours.  I can't do it, and I don't know why, and I don't know what's wrong with me.  I came back from my exam tonight and just cried.  It sucked.  I could've done the same if I had gone out all weekend and then just studied Sunday and Monday night..it just completely ruined my day...I'll be ecstatic if I can even 3.0 the class let alone 3.75 it. fuckin a.

Anyways, finally went downstairs, bought some food, came back up here and was going to do homework when Dauve, Bien, Brandon, and Greg stopped by.  Random but cool..Definitely made my night better.  crazy MSU kids. Also, the pillow I'm laying on totally smells like Brandon.

...I'm exhausted...the semester needs to be over.  10 days, 5 exams, and 1 paper to go..."

"event","Things have been crazy good lately.  I was home over the weekend, which, if this weekend was any indication of how summer will be, I'm rather looking forward to it. (I know, I used awesome grammar in that last sentence)

Anyways, Friday night ate a home cooked meal and then went to Bien's, and chilled with 'the old group,'  went and played pool and then we ended back up at my house playing Resident Evil 4 and all around scaring the crap out of me.  I hate zombies.

Saturday was everything I could possibly miss about home combined into one day.  Lunch with the family, shopping and actually getting stuff for myself from B. Republic and Bebe, tanning, the driving range with Kat, Kevin, and Brad, napping on the couch, and then going to Brandon's with Bien.  I didn't know about half of the people there, but it was fun anyways.  We played with Pogs, and watched the Star Wars trailer (f'ck yeah!  ....I really couldn't care less about Star Wars)

Easter morning I got up at 7:30, did Easter stuff with my mom, then with my dad...then church..then my grandma's..then my dad's...then Kevin's, and I finally made it back up to school around 9.  It was a crazy busy day, but I got a lot of money, new clothes, sunglasses, and candy out of it.


The downside to this weekend was that I didn't do any work, which put me way behind this week, which means that I haven't had time to stop and sit for 5 minutes since Sunday night.  Being stuck doing work every waking minute of the day really sucks given the warm weather.  It sucks in cold weather, but warm weather just makes it ten times worse. (Just FYI..I love warm weather and the crazy people in the DIAG) I finally got time today because my paper that was due Thursday has been postponed a week; however, I still have 2 exams Thursday, and chem CACH and lab reports due tomorrow.  


I might go for a run in the Arb today, it's too nice to waste the day on chemistry...kind of.

Also, I'm really loving the new Copeland album....concert this Monday at the Magic Stick? I wish I could go...

"event","Things have been crazy around here lately.  Pulled 20 hour days of work/classes/exams last week.  Concluded by a rowdy night at Pike for St. Patrick's Day.  It was crazy with 2 frats and 2 sororities, plus the guest list.  The place was packed and gave me a headache after awhile.  I ended up chilling in the basement a lot of the time, which was basically only for Pike brothers and people they allowed down there.  It was sooo much quieter and nicer. Got back relatively early and went to bed, because I had an exam Friday.

Friday night I stayed in, did absolutely nothing, and it was perfect.  Kat was mad that I didn't come over her house, but quite frankly, I was tired and felt as though getting off of my futon would've been way too much effort.

I slept until 2 today, which explains why I'm still up.  Some guy called this afternoon right when I woke up and was just like, ""hey, let's fuuuuck"" and then started to try to have phone sex?  It was weird, I was tired and confused, so I hung up.  If I would've been more awake, I would've just set the phone down and went back to sleep.  All well.  Alison and I played Super Mario 3 a good majority of the day and then I went to polo.  The horses were crazy today.  I had awesome timing and was actually quite on today; however, Chick was insane and running away with me.

Tonight, I basically did homework the entire evening.  I have a huge list of Things to Do, and I got 7 crossed off tonight, which leaves 8 to do tomorrow.

One of the things I did tonight was plan out my classes for the next 3 years given the new concentration.  I'm scared. <lj-cut text=""This is my plan"">

I will need 83 credits to graduate by the end of this semester, 79 by the beginning of the fall term.

by then, if I have studied abroad, I will have at least 132 credits, where I only need 120 to graduate.  Graduate early? huh?  I have no idea how that happened.  I think it's a combination of the damn sciences that are 5 credits and summer and AP credits.  Weird. </lj-cut>


So anyways, my weekend nights were both very entertaining.  Last night I talked to Dave Gablablabla for probably like 2 hours, and then today I was passed around over the phone to Ben, Dave, Greg, and Brandon.  It was quite the entertainment."

I'm not gonna lie, Hot Hot Heat concert was probably the best concert I've ever been to.  

<i>Highlights</i>
-Brian Fellows Safari Planet before we left
-""I hear their lead singer plays the keys and dances around on stage a lot.  They're apparently really good
  live"" -Kevin
  ""Dude..didn't you go see them live before?"" -Brad
  ""...oh yeah..."" -Kevin
-going to the Mexican restaurant in Greektown, sitting there for an hour eating nothing but nachos.
-Steve the Pirate soundcheck guy. SCURRRRVY!
-""I LIKE MUSIC!""
-""Louis the XIV was a terrible king.  He died for a reason and should have remained dead""
-Brad and Kevin making some girl cry after Brad gave her a drum stick from Louis XIV instead of breaking it.
-The all around awesome show by HHH.  When the lead singer has an awesome fro, you know the entire show is gonna be good.  They had so much energy it was insane.  Definitely well worth the 2 terrible openers.
-The setlist...they did a lot of new stuff and a lot of old stuff.  I was really glad they played ""Oh, Godamnit,"" ""This Town,"" and ""Naked in the City Again.""  Only song I kind of wished they would've played was ""Aveda"" which would've fit in with the rest of the setlist.  Overall, it kicked ass and I'm really excited for their new stuff.
-The mosh pit that formed at the end..it was just crazy..but who the hell moshes at HHH?
-""What? I can't hear you. I'm sorry, you'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel""
-Ride home listening to Spanks Colorful and talking about how to make it better.  I think they might do a cover of ""Layla"" :) ...or ""Take My Breath Away"" haha
-Watching school bus races on TV. random.



It was a really awesome night, although not only were my ears blown out and my throat hurt...my neck kind of hurt from having to look up at Brad and Kevin all night, who are both over a foot taller than me.  At any rate, I'm really glad I went and last night was so much better than being back at school tonight unpacking and studying."

"event","Polo tonight was awesome.  First of all, we got there and there were some deer chillin in the field eating grass and whatnot.  So what do Megan E., Emma, and I do?  CHASE THEM!  So after running after some deer, we went inside and tacked up to exercise the horses.  One of our horses' names is Bohemian (Bo)..randomly Kat just starts singing ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ..so then  I started singing...and then Megan E sang...and then Emma, and we got a kickass chorus going throughout the barn.  Yeah, we totally kicked Queen's ass.  Then we got on and sang a little bit of ""Total Eclipse of the Heart.""  Quite the entertainment.  Now for the really awesome part...we used draw reins today.  I've never used them before this, and sheit.  You would think our ponies are the rejects of the polo world, given that they don't go down to Florida for summer polo, but no...with draw reins, they become so precise.  We could be cantering, pull the rein and turn on a dime to go the other way, halt immediately, turn the other way again.  It was insane.  Our ponies are the shit and for this, I am glad. haha

So yeah, polo was fun.  Match this Friday, kind of near MSU...at Sundance Stable.  We're playing MSU's JV team.  It should be interesting, if nothing else.  It probably won't be a fast paced game, but then again, I could be wrong.  Grand Rapids will probably be when the better games are...that's the weekend after this one, Friday and Saturday, 2 games...party at Kat's in between. yay!


I also realized today that this guy in my English class is the asian version of Brad.  Weird?  I think so."

"event","Looking back on today, it was pretty interesting.  In Political Science, I decided that if I had lived in the 1500s, I would've been a pirate.  I don't know, it just sounded fun.  Either that or a princess.  Actually, princess is my goal now.  I just have to get on that whole...playing polo with Prince William thing.

Had a lab fiesta for 4 hours today.  I had to switch the brains from the perfusions from the formalin to a 30% sucrose, 70% formalin solution that I made.  I got to do it all by myself, which was a good, competent feeling. Way to let the undergrad play with dangerous chemicals, guys.  2 claps on hit. But anyways, Kevin and I made a fiesta out of it, cuz he was doing histology stuff too, so we played some crazy salsa/spanishish music.  It was fun...dancing and switching brains around.  Just like old times. 

Next week when I work I get to use the cryostat to make brain slices!  yay!

I also feel the need to admit that I've been really addicted to watching British Parliament on TV.  It's good to have on in the background when doign work..and also just to watch while I'm getting ready for class or something.  Al, Jill, and I watched this documentary on the Nile yesterday on the Discovery Channel Egypt week.  Yeah, we rock at life.

I'm looking at doing research at Wayne over the summer...hopefully I can get a job there.

I also figured out today that I'd reallllly like to go to NYU for med/grad school.  They've got some really good programs.  In actuality, I'd like to go anywhere that will accept me.  John Hopkins would be nice.  Or any Ivy League."

"event","so I was running and I realized that part of the lyrics to ""A Decade Under the Influence"" say, ""anyone will do tonight.""  I laughed.

Other than that, I have done nothing but sleep, homework, and eat all day. Chilled with Al and Mike for awhile, but that's about it


ok, scratch that...I left this entry to put up Christmas lights.  Alison and I put up 500 white lights all around our loft and room.  It looks soooo good with the lights off! I'm stoked for Christmas, and the lights which we're just keeping up the rest of the year.  I have so much energy now and our room looks tight. :)

Ironic that I was talking to Dave Gablablabla about how I need to start working harder and stop procrastinating and as soon as I said it, Al asked if I wanted to put up lights and I left to do that instead of homework.  All well, all the work that I have been doing lately has been exhausting me.  I can't wait until Christmas break where I definitely won't have anything that I need to get done for school :)

Brian brought Liz a wristband for his frat's playboy party Friday night. Lis has prior obligations. Liz is sad. :(


Liz is also sad because she just spent 2 hours reading and writing about an essay that she did not have to.


Liz has 4 chapters to read before she can sleep and a very important econ. class at 9 in the morning.


Liz is going to get on that.


Liz wants her hair cut like this http://www.rwitherspoon.com/images/displayimage.php?album=403&pos=2 ...we likey?

"event","<i>""Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge - they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around.""</i>


I'm really beginning to think that love actually isn't all around.  I don't know.  I've been thinking about it all day, and right now love is something that is seemingly dissipating from the world as we know it.  It started in Anthropology today.  A class of 500, the professor asks how many people are married in the room, no one raises their hand...how many people are engaged, no one raises their hand...how many people are in love, once again, no one raises their hand.  500 people in the room and not one of them in love.  It's not even so much being in love...it's love in general that I'm finding increasingly absent in the people around me. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places or maybe I'm oblivious to it because I'm too preoccupied with work and such.  I can think of few examples where someone has actually done anything, not even particularly extraordinary, just anything that proved their love to someone else.  It'd be nice to see more expressions of love more often, I guess. I'm sick of just seeing selfish or destructive actions. For some reason today I keep on picturing the old people dancing on the beach.  There's something about old people and love.  I think it makes me feel that love is a lasting thing.  Far too often people who love each other hurt each other.  And I'm still not even talking about being ""in love"" because I really can't form an opinion on something I know nothing about.  Just love, in general....love is a thought provoking topic in and of itself without bringing in the factor of where is it?!  With that said..I love you all and goodnight :)"

so other than that, had 2 midterms today that I'm not thrilled with. (MUST GET GOOD GRADES, UNDERGRAD RESEARCH, AND HONORS THESIS DAMNIT) Studied for anthropology a little, Dan visited for awhile, talked to a bunch of random people, and now I've got to take care of my little stoners...fun times.

Tomorrow is Thursday...Pol. Sci. lecture 9-10, then probably going to fight some biatches about doing research somewhere, lunch with Joser, studying Anthro and then I don't know what.  Yay for semi-weekendness :)"

"event","Well, I took a page out of <u>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</u> and deleted every post in the Live Journal since the start of school.  I would've gotten rid of more, but I just don't have that kind of time.  The past month and a half was nothing but bleak entries dwelling on the tragedies of life.  I don't know how often I'll update this anymore.  I don't want to have to look back and see every time I'm depressed or the least bit disheartened by any one event in my life.  I like looking at the happy times, the ones where no matter what was wrong in the world, the good things always overshadowed it.  Here's to a more blissful Live Journal....

I also bought to most kickass curling iron today. It's ceramic with a 1.25 inch barrel. And it's pretty and it was on sale.  It's just all around kickass.


Not much else to update.  I'm watching <u>Sleepless in Seattle</u> right now.  I love the part where he's on the phone talking about his wife.  It's just so...I dont know.  I could watch this movie every day and not get sick of it.



I'm really confused as to what's going on.  I thought Kevin flew into CT today and that his flight got in at 4.  I also thought that my mom was going to be home later tonight, which would be physically impossible if they picked the Kev up from the airport and then drove home.  I'm so confooooosed."

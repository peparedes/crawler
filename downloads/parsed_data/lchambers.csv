"event","Well, the last link has been snapped in my support unit back in Oklahoma. (I just found out --I'll explain more below.) <P>How much damage do you think someone could cause to someone's life if they were <EM>really </EM>hell-bent on it? I mean, if you were going to be gone for 3 weeks, someone <EM>knew</EM> <EM>where</EM> you were staying, and how to influence your roommates in <EM>their</EM> favor. And suppose they'd been working fervently on brooding your roommates favor <EM>while you were gone?</EM> I suspect it to be a person (who I referred to as ""V"" in previous posts). How much pre-meditation&nbsp;do you think ""V"" (if he's the catalyst)&nbsp;used in&nbsp;devising <EM>just-the-right tactics</EM> in order to not only make&nbsp;my roommates dislike me, but completely stark-raving <EM>hate</EM> me? (I'm still on vacation in Oregon state.)&nbsp;Even though I'm <EM>still</EM> far away, it's like the <EM>bus of my life</EM> took a stop at the ""Jerry-Springer"" twilight zone, and I'm stuck with (unexpected) results, until I can get home to straighten everything out. The latest? Well, apparently, this person is not going to rest until they see me completely unraveled. This person will just <EM>not stop!</EM>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is he trying to manipulate my roommates' favor by <EM>buying</EM> them things, apparently, his money was able to afford him complete evisceration of my <EM>most personal</EM> belongings from a dwelling which I'd formerly thought of as a <EM>'safe-haven'</EM>. (Do you know how disheartening this is??) I mean, I'm going to leave the safety of my family in a few days, only to go back to ""no place"", but also, I've got to worry about this 'freak' trying to stalk me &amp; dismantle my life! </P>
<P>&nbsp;Anyway, the catalyst for this&nbsp;post is;&nbsp;""T""&nbsp;is back from vacation. He's been wrongly informed of things (I didn't say). He sent me a cussing-out email today,... <EM>when I'm 2-fucking-thousand miles away!</EM> (Well, I'm sure I mentioned that ""V"" had a past relationship w/ one of&nbsp;my roommates, &amp; she happens to hate&nbsp;me for no reason, except I think ""V""&nbsp;influenced her&nbsp;to dislike me). The other roommate ""T""&nbsp;had a latent interest in&nbsp;me (which I zapped in the bud early, since I did <EM>not </EM>reciprocate. But&nbsp;I did stay nice to that person for helping&nbsp;me out). </P>
<P>I&nbsp; know this post is going to be poorly written. It's late, and perhaps I shouldn't have sat down to write anything. It's just on my mind, and I've got to deal with it. (I like ""J"" &amp; my mom's suggestion the best: ""If there <EM>is</EM> anything remaining, just pretend that you had a big fire, that you lost everything, and let it go"")... <BR>I know they're right. I'm sure the white-trash will have made out pretty good with my things... things that I've had for years --things that kept me company in a lonely world (-much like Tom Hanks' ""ball"" kept him company in that shipwrecked movie). Now, I'm facing the reality of having to seperate from items that were <EM>not just mere things</EM>, but anchors in a world of uncertainty... things that made me remember: <EM>'hey, I made it this far... I'm still here; I remember where I've been, &amp; the strength I drew upon in hard times. These things remind&nbsp;me of my past, give me strength so that&nbsp;I have the will to keep drudging on'...</EM></P>"

"event","This is part 2 of yesterday's post. I've called the police department in Oklahoma City, regarding my (allegedly) missing items. I'm expecting a call back from an officer this afternoon, because they need to do identity protection (since some of the things taken included my birth certificate, diplomas, box of unused bank checks, etc., --somebody could really take me to the cleaners!!) Well, I keep thinking that a name change is in order anyway... so that'll probably definitely happen once I get back from vacation. (Being in show-biz, I have an advantage on the name change thing --I can do so more easily, with&nbsp;almost no&nbsp;red-tape.) This sucks... To make matters worse, ""villain"" keeps trying to call me every few hours (obsessed much??) I'm currently surfing the web to find out if I can get a discounted (or union-based) protection, based on the fact that I'm in Radio, and it may be time to seek protection against obsessive people... like ""V"". I seriously think ""V"" took the items, and is holding them ransom. (Thank GOD my Mustang is somewhere he'll never find it!) (Many people --even people he's just met have told me he's <EM>deeply</EM> in love with me.) When I <EM>did</EM> have to acquiesce to talking to him last week (just to find out where the hell my stuff was), he slipped and said, ""T"" told me to take your stuff --he said you'd <EM>have to</EM> come to me if you were looking for it."" Hmmm... (That might be all the evidence I need.) I told him to ""Have a Merry F-ing Christmas, keep the items you're <EM>holding ransom, </EM>because the worth of them does <EM>not</EM> justify <EM>ever</EM> seeing you (or those freaks at the apartment) ever again!"" Then I hung up on him.&nbsp;Yes... I was heated. (Wouldn't you be?) I&nbsp;haven't &nbsp;answered my phone since, but I have received several <EM>tearful/remorseful</EM> messages from ""V"". Meanwhile, T is not returning my emails (he's in Canada). Personally, I don't think&nbsp;T was involved. This happened after T left for Canada. If he <EM>was</EM> involved (as V says he is),&nbsp;V could've got the stuff way before! I'm sure this is really boring to most people. I apologize... it's just very avid in my mind right now (a bit of a mystery). One thing's for sure... I'm going to undergo a complete identity change (don't worry --it won't affect my livejournal identity/postings), and I'm going to get a new cell number, etc., I want to be as elusive (&amp; unavailable --especially to ""V') as possible. Drop the soap-operas! If you want some good drama, stay tuned to my livejournal posts!"

"event","<P>As long as I'm posting these <EM>posts</EM> from my parents' house in Oregon, they've got to be short &amp; to the point. It's a long story, but basically, when I was younger, I spent&nbsp;A LOT of time on the computer. So... these days, I try to stay off their computer. </P>
<P>Ok: The scene is: I was staying with people until I left for my Oregon vacation. The plan is for me to get a place once I get back, but I didn't want to waste money paying for a place when I was going to be gone for almost a month. Anyway, about 2 months ago, when I decided to move out of ""the villain's"" house, these people not only invited me to live with them, they even moved my stuff out of (the aforementioned) Villain's house. They then offered protection against him, and (what seemed to be at the time), camaraderie. <BR>From my point of view: I've been trying to get along with everyone/trying <EM>not</EM> to ruffle feathers, etc., The pinnacle of my concerns has been mapping the blueprint of my life, as it will be when I return to Oklahoma City. I have spent most of my free-time carefully planning my course of action. (I eat right, take care of my looks, etc., But that's not narcicism; it's just personal-tidiness. Oh yeah, not to mention <EM>I AM</EM> going into the entertainment industry... and although it's radio, it behooves me to try to stay polished for the public eye.) Well anyway...&nbsp;Circumstances affect mindset to a certain degree. So you have to imagine that my work schedule, fledgling production company, and self-promotion have me pretty pre-occupied, right? Right... Of course, most ""normal"" people (especially former Californians) could recognize and appreciate autonomy that most ""house-mates/roommates"" do (and should) exhibit, so that subsequent drama (aka: intrusion into personal issues) is altogether avoided. Of course, what was I thinking?? How could I expect some <EM>backwoods rednecks</EM> to ""mind their own business""?? (That's like asking Jerry Springer guests <EM>not </EM>to get dramatic... Well, <EM>it is</EM> the <EM>same</EM> echelon of people, after all... <EM>probably kin</EM>.) Ok, I may seem condescending in this post, but I assure you, I went into the situation with an exemplary degree of diplomacy. As usual, one has to prove themselves to be a bad person (otherwise, I give everyone the benefit of a doubt). So, to that end, I suppose I'll provide a background of information for you to form your opinion of... them. The initial ""inviter"" is someone whom I'll refer to as ""resident T"". T is the most normal of the group (actually works for a living, and wants to break away from ""the others"".) And then, there's the ""others"". This is not to knock <EM>all</EM> sucking parasites of the sector of American people who reap the benefit of taxpayers money. I'm sure if you're on assistance (and under 45), you've got a legitimate reason, right? Ok then... I know that (at least) 2 of the following 6-8 people are on some kind of government assistance. The others are just barnacles on the benefit wagon (latched on for the free-ride). Since they don't work, they've got a LOT of time to create drama. You have to imagine that my neighboring female counterparts are sweatpant-wearing, teeth-missing gals, which makes me seem glamorous by contrast. Since I was perceived as a threat, I caused quite a stir with the resident females by proxy of 'being around'.) Since the girls were up in arms about my trespass into ""their territory"", it caused a subsequent following of dislike amongst the male residents. (As previously mentioned), I tried to diffuse the havoc I knew would soon ensue, and lied (& told everyone that I was a lesbian.) (Unexpectedly, I got some peace from that move.) Uh... that lasted about 5 days. But the rednecks weren't convinced. Soon, I was back on the gossip fork, and beginning to be hated by most (even pursued (& even ""stalked"") by still more unsavory people (some who weren't even deterred by the lesbian lie, but ""motivated""!!...) But mostly, I was&nbsp;labeled a slut, bitch, etc., (You can actually read a previous post about some funny happenings where I was ""standing too close"" to one of the neighbor's ""man"".) LOL. But seriously... my world's been the twilight zone. So I suppose it was no surprise when I ""heard"" that my stuff had been removed from the aforementioned dwelling (not days, but...) HOURS after T assured me it'd be safe there (until J came to pick it up). (Resident T is currently on vacation in Canada.) But my efforts were usurped. Again... I have no clue as to which of 4 suspicious people it could be... but I suspect it's the ""villain"", with a little help from a fat, nasty, former-girlfriend of his (who happens to be a previous resident/still holds a key there... and oh yeah, she&nbsp;<EM>HATES</EM> me). I'm sure that they had a marvelous time chucking my stuff in the dumpster... and exploiting the things they could use (among them, a box of unused checks!!) Don't worry though, I cancelled those checks. What's worse, resident T had the only other key to my mini-storage, &amp; the gate code. I asked him to drop the key into one of the boxes. (Who knows, he may have GIVEN it to the thieves.) Anyway, this is not going to be written eloquently. It's hurried, and nervous, since I should be doing more... I promise to polish this up and have it spun-woven into a (hopefully) good read in the coming days. Part 2 coming later. </P>"

"event","Well, here goes another entry. I'll do my best to type quickly with these acrylic nails I'm sporting (from a radio interview I had shortly before I left Oklahoma City). I'm still in Oregon right now, finishing up the last of my delightful holiday visit with my family. My brother, the computer-programmer has flown in from San Diego. My cousin (a producer for ESPN) has flown in all the way from New York. (More about my family later...) For now, there have been even bigger attention-encapsulating events commanding that I plan my course of action (on how to handle) this series of events that happened (almost immediately) after I left for Oregon. I'm acutely aware of the fact that my life has been ripped apart at the seams back in Oklahoma City, by someone who's become a villain to me, whilst I am stuck here, hopelessly hearing about the disposal of my personal items... yet, no one will take the blame for it. My next step? A police report, of course. What's particularly disarming is the fact that this villain waited until I left to pounce. I was assured that my stuff would be safe. I don't know who planned it, who assisted, etc., All I know is... I'm very ""hated""... by many, it seems. One of the primary reasons I decided to begin posting on Livejournal, was to dispell any suspicions that people may have about me (the greatest one being that I'm flaky, or a user). (For me to maintain an heir of mystery could be a fatal blow, since people naturally don't trust me.) This gives people an inside glimpse into my mind. <BR>I will write more later..."

I'm leaving for Oregon (from the dastardly state of Oklahoma) to see my parents/family for Christmas. I leave in 2 weeks. It will be the first Lydia and I have seen them in almost a year and a half. Oklahoma is a really strange state (I'll touch into more detail at a later time). I'll never understand the whole ""OU"" thing (I guess that's cause I'm from California, where we have ""real"" professional teams). But there's this whole weird mentality about OU fans, like, you're nonexistent if you don't like OU. I'm guessing since they're pretty much undefeated in the college football genre, it's the only tangible victory they can hold up and tell the world, ""Look! See! We don't suck so bad after all!"" LOL (I shouldn't be chuckling.) There's actually a few of the Okies that I find decent and cultured (""few"" is the operative word here). Well, I'm going to shut the hell up now, before I alienate myself from the Okies, and find myself in a ""redneck"" mexican standoff. Speaking of which... I'm staying with a friend right now (just until I get back from Oregon, and get into my own place (no sense in paying for a place if I'm going to be gone for almost a month). The neighbors here have not taken kindly to me. I've been accused of ""standing too close to one of the neighbor lady's men"". I nipped it in the bud, and just told everybody ""don't worry, I'm a lesbian."" LOL (Even though it's not true.) It actually bought be about 5 extra drama-free days. (Course, then they began to doubt my lesbianism, and have gone back to labeling, shit-stirring, and drama-creating.) 
I'm going to have to add more to this post later. As a matter of fact, 2 boys are creating havoc around me (while their mom stands idly by, allowing them to trample and destroy anything in their paths...)

Anyway, this livejournal thing seems pretty cool. Lord knows my life would probably seem very exciting to many people. I suppose I'll drizzle a little bit of my past  stories of inexplainable luck (as well as weird happenings) amidst my posts from day to day (more like a referral to them.) Nah... On second thought... I don't wanna bore anyone. LOL ;-) 
Hey! This is actually fun! (Thanks J for helping me find this site!) Anyway, I need to get offline. Syanara for now!"

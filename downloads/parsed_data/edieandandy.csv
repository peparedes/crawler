"event","well it feels like its weighing me down to the ground but upon further investigation it seems to be making me lighter than air, giving the strong desire to blow away with the wind. like a free radical to soar and sink above it all, but then one remembers one's own humanity and falls like a rock to the ground, sinking beneath in the earth's motherly embrace. for we are all made of a faulty material, one cannot go on living life as callous or uncaring, there are some things from which there is no running away, and these cause emotions that grip you like a vice. then you sit down with your 7th drink and ponder it all, it is only from this perspective, within your brain's struggling efforts to keep your heart beating and motor senses running, it is then that it all makes sense, you file it away in your cabinet and are at peace. and you fly away into the beautiful dark sky of dreams and forgetting. 

morning brings the fall back: to earth, to cycles upon cycles of repeated history, to the faulty material of the brain, to old and new obsessions, to an empty heart."

"event","I find myself once again writing here, for there has been much going on but I have not had the urge to express it electronically. I am in NY, at home. I recently moved from Boston where I finished off a rockin' summer and lay alot of good friendships in wait for my return, from EUROPE! I am going to Prague next friday, Sept 1st, to study abroad for 4 months. I am taking some of the most amazing classes, from a European history course taught by a Holocaust survivor & WII vet, to this alternative literature class titled ""From Kafka to Kundera"". Kundera is part of my inspiration to make this trip. He is amazing, his essence speaks to me more than anything I have ever read. Nay, I feel his words rather than read them, feel for the concepts intuitively and understand their cosmic importance. 
Anyways. I'm also taking a course on European subcultures/countercultures. I think (know) I'm quitting Business school. I'm too idealistic and too independent for corporate culture. I am seeking out an alternate course of study, some ideas have ranged from international affairs to journalism to law school. My personal goal to figure this out is by May '07. 

So, PRAGUE! The city of a thousand spires! Bohemia! Plsen! Being able to buy a fucking beer!!!!!!! Life is one heck of a thing.

new years was terrible but i am just gonna pretend its still 2005 and im still lying to myself.

if this fucking journal was any justifiable means of communication, which it isnt, i would consider taking it seriously. god i wanna jam my foot so far up that it comes out in china. dont bother reading your computer is lying to you. julie arkadevna buchik has turned herself into an old woman, a hag, a little housewife with no life. but i try to fight it every now and  then, to no avail. my bosom bears the weight of both my ego and his. and as im fulfilling his responcibilities oh fuck it

<strike>ill finish later.</strike>

its later, im angry but not as much so. how would you like it if your favorite holiday in the year was taken away from you? what the fuck indeed. when i came back to my house from Ithaca yesterday i saw a multitude of liquor bottles and streamers and funny hats in the garbage and i realized my family partied waaaaay harder than myself. imagine that sheer godawful feeling, does it start the year out right??? whoever unlucky enough to still be reading this entry would probably take me for a nag, someone who wants pity...sad people want pity, angry people want retribution. and if you reason that one little night is no reason to be so disappointed, imagine this: (by fault of yourself,someone else the most exciting day of the year was turned into a monotonous and socially degrading goose chase, drinking jim beam and coke out of a plastic water bottle while sitting in a parked car watching promo ads on a tv on display in the store window of Rent-A-Center in a little upstate town, pissing on the side of the highway in the snow, going to a party about 10 minutes before midnight where they were all strangers, there were no champagne glasses, and the countdown involved a laptop and some  random dude knocking into me, an unfinished game of backgammon, i went to sleep drunk and crying at 1:30am only to wake up at 6:00am sober and crying because it all came back to me. 

now you may want to call me a snob-nosed socialite, an unpleasable bitch, or an ungrateful moron, or even say that its probably all my fault, which it is partly. you may want to say get over it, whats the big deal, and why are you making all this into such a hard time. i frankly dont know, but if you know me well you would see that i am not an argumentative or angry person. and neither am i a sock puppet. why ive allowed myself to become these things is what i yearn to figure out and how i can get back is what i must know."

im not sure why this thing still lives. 

i am such a different person than i was, looking back about a year. and i couldnt possibly put it into words for you, it would take me a day to write a word. it would take me a year to explain. the next few paragraphs are not about the timid or unknown:
<center> progressivity. </center>
the waves keep on crashing, their bluish green surf attacking the shore and always slowly receding to the watery depths. the waxes and wanes of life, the patterns i used to think were going to show me the secret. i have learned nothings ever going to ""show itself"" to you, you must seek out the truth and purpose with your own eyes, unclouded by the past, the present, the people that have marked you with their personality or their life, and most importantly the way you are used to thinking. 
<center> romantica </center>
the saying ""too much of a good thing"" makes me uneasy and confused. is there too much ??? of course and absolutely not. alot of it makes one happy, too much makes them sick. well what about not wanting to stop, not having to, constantly reinforced by the aspects of your lover's ever receptive personality, only to be pushed away by his childish and withdrawn doubts and compulsions? I feel like a peice of driftwood  that has been engulfed by sea, a sea that sands me down, makes me dull but beautiful and soft to the touch, under complete control of the wave's whims i careen to and fro between confusion, anger, apathy and love, belonging, identity. and when we make love i feel that maddeningly wonderful whirlpool i cannot escape and do i want to?

Clinging to this beautiful but cruel metropolis, proclaiming it as the best city in the world is answering a question that is not being asked. In order to ask the question properly you must embark on a journey, see other places, meet other people, but it will not work if your eyes remain closed. I secretly pity the vast amount of intelligent friends and acquaintances of mine who chose to stay here, attending the same 5 schools as generations of Tech kids have gone to. But that is my raw and unpolished opinion, and opinions are constantly changing much like the environments of hunter gatherers at the dawn of time. to them constant change was a way of life. they would usurp the land and when it became barren....change was at a high tide.

spend some quality time with my baby, make it easy.

you can walk anywhere here. everybody is chill. yeah so what the shower doesent work and i dont know anyone.

because i enjoy beer and marijuana.
and was honest about everything i had done in my life.

sometimes its best not to think in words.

the man knows me not. it just makes me angry because it took me so long to dispel that druggie mentality. to get that 3.9 GPA. to be on good terms with my family and myself. im just quite shaken up from this past year.... 

Dr. this is for you:

P.S. I found a marijuana legalization community from all of the regions of post-USSR on livejournal(haha MOTHERLAND) and its awesome that the MMMarch has 187 cities signed up this year. From every major city in Eastern and Western Europe to South America to Asia to the Middle East to Canada to almost every state in the USA. Spread the good word, the Million Marijuana March is on May 7th, this Saturday. It starts on houston and broadway at 1pm. We will march through downtown manhattan culminating in a rally in Battery Park. In the name of medicinal marijuana, marijuana legalization, personal liberties, ibogaine education, melatonin and MUCH MUCH MORE. Come out in the beautiful weather and celebrate your freedom of assembly and your favorite plant!! 

Peace."

"event","im not going to describe the horror, sorrow and incredible emotional and physical pain of the past 10 days (Jan 17th to today). its too fucking personal and livejournal will never be the place for it.

im just gonna ramble on about things that the world will fail to understand...

i am a fucking terrible judge of character. i am a naive sheep bleeting my personal life to any one who can listen. you dont even have to be my friend for me to turn to you for emotional comfort. emotional comfort, hovewer, is a luxury i cannot afford anymore.

""Nobody likes hurting other people, nobody within my ""college family"" at least."" I thought like this for a long time. but my ""college family"" does not exist, much like my real family. silent judgements, words and notions are exchanged between them but nobody stands up and just says it like it is, never to my face. instead, clandestine rumors are passed around like a joint. and everybodys high except I. 

so many people have been wounded by my actions and the blood is pouring down the walls. like an eggshell the situation has cracked. and i had the nerve to think it was more stable, more safe, more....real.
 
and the pain just keeps on coming. like the snow that wont end. my fucking sanity is buried under a foot of snow and its dying of exposure. exposure to you all. even if you dont know what the fuck im talking about.

everything i touch just turns to shit. it stinks from the rotten core of my existence.
i just want it to end. please god, please....
 
several brash decisions and:
1. I have broken somebody's heart. our relationship is on the brink of destruction.
2. My health is a complete mystery to me, still. i ache with it, it eats at me.
3. Those ""apparently"" closest to me now beleive that i am dirty and malicious, a poor excuse for a human being, unable to handle my own problems so i share them with those who have nothing but kindness towards me.
4. My schoolwork is turning into a giant tumor, growing by the day, threatening to burst all over the place.
5. I dont know what im doing anymore.

My mother told me all my life not to trust anyone. Not to get too involved and watch out for yourself.

Now my mother's foolish daughter has very little left to make her smile.
and alot to make her want to die."

"event","You know, it took me a good 15 minutes trying to remember my weekend so I can describe it for you here, faithful readers. Strange couple of days, man.

Wednesday I was distraught because of bad news. However, this is not the place to be descriptive. All I know is that somebody did much potential wrong to a member of my ""college"" family and as such, I was outraged to no end. There is no excuse for being a dirty turncoat, no matter how hard those incredibly imposing campus police officers press you. Civility doesent work with morons, so don't ask me to be nice to you. 

What is really still bothering me from that night has nothing to do with the rat. It has to do with my irresponcible tendencies, and even more with how they are impacting somebody I love. And how much I wish that what I've convinced myself isn't true and everything will be the same as it was. The unknown is torment, but the known might be oblivion. I dont know.

drank a 100proof drink to forget that i dont know.
but how can you forget something like that?

Thursday night went to see this marvelous reggae band, John Brown's Body. Drank and danced was delighted. Went to a party full of olders, realized age means little in the 20s. Fun night didn't know where the hell my money went. 

Friday I had awesome breakfast in bed watching ""Eternal Sunshine"". Made me think of cass, my savior on this earth. Came home more content than I have ever remembered coming home. Had the world on a string...drank a 40, overdosed on hummus, nearly passed out until a phone call to westland, where a very drunk pineapple man took me in his arms to sleep. 

That night I had the most horrible dream. Reminded me of someone from the past. Reminded me of wanting to die for that person. Reminded me how fucking terrible it is to be thrown around like youre not human. I thought the past has past if you live in the present, but you don't in your dreams. Subconsciousness you made me cry.

I had a weird day after that. That dream brought back certain things I havent felt since I came here. Like the weight of an empty wallet, the need to lose control and the unexplainable dread of tomorrow. Drank Captain Morgan and watched ""The Cable Guy"" with a new friend at the YMCA. After that the night seemed to last days. I should have passed on it but the only way saturday was gonna end involved doing a keg stand, puking in the sink and getting thrown out of the party. 

Woke up this morning to find myself lost again.

Im coming to new york on tuesday. Its going to be more of a family vacation, but ill find time for you if you find time for me. 

For a long entry this said very little."

"event","I feel like,

This/next year is going to be different.

To be more specific, I hope that for once this year will be fruitful, emotionally.
I want to reap what I sow. November & December have been, for years, a period of reproach and nostalgia. I feel like I don't need to think about all the things I am lacking because what I have now was just a dream to me once.

((A warm &hearts; for the cold wind))

For those of you who aren't quite sure what im talking about just imagine what it feels like to have parted ways with peace of mind and sanity around november 10th every year for 4 years.

thats why i dont like to watch movies with good endings. makes us beleive in nonsense like honor, truth and freedom. 

i didnt know that sheer stupidity is the majority in this country. 

in other news,

a certain four letter word has been lodged in the back of my throat. nudged outward with every drink and caress. silent i shall stay until the perfect time. ive been having the urges to cook and do dishes and wear skirts. 

and i feel very lucky to be alive."

"event","this morning i woke up with a bad case of realizing that taking chances is only valuable when the output is favorable. i need to grow the fuck up. and this nasty feeling needs to go away. people need to live up to themselves. i need to stop setting myself up. fuck dude, i wish i could run away from it. but that never works. what works is being honest with yourself and communicating like a responcible person. so easy to fall back into the lap of childishness. 

grrrrrrrrrr im not happy right now."

"event","Several things have come to light and others still lay in the dark, like abandoned crossword puzzles and unfinished lego sets, never ever to be made sense of.
I feel like I am in a much better place now that ive been through a very rude and painful reinforcement of negativity from a certain individual who i thought i knew but never really did. i just hope that one day they regret the hostility with which they threw me away and realize that nobody in this entire world will ever be so dumb as to love them like i did.

But this is old news. 

I love being back here in school. Makes me feel like I have a purpose. That and I can always run away into my own little world which, very recently, has once again expanded to fit two. People are kind here. Bud is kind here. There is nothing like an industrial size can of Chef Boyardee beef ravioli. The baseball is really starting to affect me. Say it aint so, dem Sox better lose, I cant take another fucking drunk assholes parade.    

i bid you all a good day."

"event","You heard right ladies and gentlemen. i am coming home (to my new LI house) on thursday night. i will be in NY until monday night. Plan B(irthday) is probably going to be at Jenichka's house on Sunday night before the ""Bump in the Night"" rave. I can't wait to make up for the horrible circumstances under which my Boston party happened. No more overbooked hotels, suprise guests, acid-anxiety or running around in the middle of nowhere looking for somewhere to stay. Don't get me wrong, this past weekend has really re-newed my faith in humanity. To cancel out the unexpected hotel suprise, there was an unexpected baloon/cake suprise from the girls on my floor. People are awesome. Thank you everyone who called, sent their regrads and especially to those who actually trooped out to Boston, I love you all.

Ill be seeing your asses soon......

&hearts;,
Julieee"

SICK!!! it was his birthday and all these hippies were there and buckethead kept playing with a rubber chicken. no words, my fellow readers, could describe how fucking bizarre this act was. especially the keyboardist bernie, from p-funk, was by far the trippiest person i have ever seen besides the purple guy on acid at vida blue last winter. 

i gotta say my first show in b-town was good, much like rice pudding. 

my birthday is in 3 days motherfuckerrrrrrrs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

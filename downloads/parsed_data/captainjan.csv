"event","I still get these ... moments sometimes.

It hurts even more when guys who weren't even in the war think they can call <i>you</i> a coward!

I met someone i served with today, his name is Jeffrey and it turns out he knew my brother in law-to-be, years back. They didn't get along then, let alone now. I've asked him to come and have dinner with us sometime, catch up on old times. Though i wonder if it's really a good idea.

I mean, things got pretty... intense back then. Sylvia doesn't know quite how intense."

"event","I worry so much about Sylvia. Since you-know-what happened she's done nothing but work, and i'm sure it's not good for her. I would make her cut down, but she is not a woman you can snap your fingers and make do things. 

Now she has to make a wedding dress for her sister. We dontated some of our coupons. It's not like we'll need them as much as we thought now. Her mother foisted it on her this morning, when i was at work. She's all over Frank, but i don't think she's ever liked me that much. It isn't as though our countries weren't allies. It doesn't bother me, really, but it bother's Sylvia and i don't want it to. Espeically not now."

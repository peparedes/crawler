"event","Well, it was time for a break. They finally let me go home for during the last week of October. And the beat part was that it was an ok trip. My parents are doing nothing like always( which was nice for me because needed to do nothing far a couple of days). My boys down in K Falls are doing the exact same thing we did before I left. And then there's my boy Aaron up near Portland. We've got to hang out when I'm home for Christmas. Or better yet, New Years Eve. Hopefully Elise is feeling better so she can come with. The Navy started my trainning back up. This stuff is getting old. I almost rather clean toliets, ALMOST! They also finally hooked the internet back up(which is why I writing). Only if I could write all the stupid stuff we've done down here. Next weekend we're going to a beach house for Thanksgiving. Don't worry, I'll tell all what happens."

"event","It taste so good once it hits your lips. The last two weekends we've had hotel parties. The days are now filled with joy once again. The changes that will make it better:
1. Get a hotel room next to the beach(already reserved for next weekend)
2. Get some ladies that aren't whores(which we find the last two weeks, luckily I stopped them from wasting their money again, studip drunks)
3. Poeple who can hold their liquir

Schools not so bad anymore. We still sit in the classroom 60 hours a week but when you space out, it doesn't seem that bad. And besides, we're getting paid for it."

I can taste it now. Some Jack, then a little russian water. OH YEAH! I write then about my drunkness."

"event","Alright, way to go Charleston. I'm finally out of Chicago( well, Great Lakes is where the base is located). I waited so long for this. But, man, this place sucks even more. NO DRINKING! No drinking? What the heck! That's not cool, not cool at all. Plus all the new rules I have to follow( well at least say I followed). Well eff the navy, eff it hard. And who turned the heat up? They told me the humidity was high, but not this high. I have stop sweating since I got here. This is a horrible place. Well maybe just the heat part. We'll see about the rest when I can go into town in civilian clothes. That sucks, having to where the uniform out. Unless, hey ladies your sailor has arrived!!
OH YEAH, it's been awhile since I slept a day away but I did it. Sweet. 25 hours of sleep in a 36 hours time period. It's the greatest thing that happen this weekend. I know, it's real exciting, huh?"

"event","Holy Bejeevs, Batman! Looks like we got fogged. 
Do you dislike when an a-hole who come up to tick(obeviously not the word I want to use but I'll try to keep it clean) you off and take it out on you?
Do you want to twist their neck around so they can't look forward?

If your one of those people who asked yes then, F YOU! I don't know who crawled up this guys, guy #1, ass but, I'm about to bounce on him. If this fool yells at me one more time today, hell will break loose. Who the hell does he like he is? Making me pick up trash for six hours. F guy #1 with the big BIRD!

And someother joker, guy #2, who tick me off today. Since we have to go to Charleston as a group, we've been waiting for guy #2 to finish his coarse work for three weeks. He finially finishes! Hooray! But wait there's more. Now we have to wait on guy #2 for two more weeks because he went to the doctor and has an appointment. I told him to wait cause he ""injury"" wasn't serious. But no he just didn't listen. Well flip the BIRD to guy #2.

I realized this morning that I've gone to the pool hall everyday for the last month. Way to go. How about a hooray for me. HOORAY! Billards is great."

"event","Yesterday had to be completely different than any other fourth I've had. Not so much that I did something new or different, but the fact we had some hot weather all week and then it decides to pour down rain. I don't mean the valley rain that I'm used to, but a hurricane storm rain. We're in Chicago. What the     ! Last time I check Chicago isn't on the coast. If someone from here reads this let me know. I would stay and write somemore but I need to hustle some kids that think they're good at pool."

"event","Well this is great! Holiday weekend and I have nowhere to go. Some of the guys are talking about going to see the movie Rize. I not sure if I want to spend the money to see a movie about dance completion. Hopfully this week I will get transferred to Charleston. I been waiting in Chicago for a month now and still no word when I'll be going. 
   I graduated from Navy boot camp on May 27. However they won't sent my to A school because they said I had to take a reading class. Well F*** them! The only problem is I've been done for most of the time scent.(If someone is reading this, now you know why I'm in Chicago.)
   Tonight there is a fireworks show. I'm not sure why it's today, the fourth is tomorrow. Nobody I know knows how to get there. It's at Fox Lake but which part? 
   The only other thing I know of this weekend is some high school party. I hope it actually happens. Crashing that party would be pretty fun."

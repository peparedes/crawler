"event","Occasionally my mind drifts to memories of one of the trials I agreed to endure in order to prove my loyalty to Dumbledore when I first came to him with my arm and my soul both dark as pitch.  He told me that it was standard procedure for all new professors, but I suspect he may have paid a bit more attention to my results, after the Ministry psychologists interviewed me.

Sometimes I remember the questions they asked, and wonder if any of my answers have changed.  Am I more mad now than I was then, or less?  Not that I trust <i>their</i> assessment of my mental stability in any case - they were obviously crackpots.  What possible purpose could have existed behind those idiotic questions?

""What is your weapon of choice?""

I had stared at him for a moment, as if waiting for the punchline.  ""Is that a serious inquiry?"" I asked, narrowing my eyes at him.  ""You do realize that I'm a <i>wizard</i>, right?  What do you think my weapon of choice is, a toothpick?""

I saw him jotting something down on the parchment in front of him.  The letters formed the word ""toothpick"" in large, loopy script.

""<i>My wand, you moron</i>!"" I bellowed.  In fact, after the two hours I had been sitting in that chair answering his stupid questions - my dream career, indeed - I rather wished I could <i>use</i> my weapon of choice.

My eyes darted to where he began to scribble again.  ""Anger management problems,"" he wrote.  ""Poor impulse control.""

I grunted and sank farther into my chair."

"event","Moonlight peeked through the shadowed trees and set a slight glow around that ridiculous turban as its owner trembled under my gaze.

""We have already had this conversation,"" I snarled, wondering how on earth this cowardly creature came to be in such a position, ""And I refuse to have it again.  Have you decided, Quirrell?  My patience grows thin, and I will do everything in my power to stop you from whatever plans you have concocted to weasel yourself into the good graces of the Dark Lord.""

""S-Severus, I cannot e-e-express how flattered I am that you f-f-f-feel I could be behind such an i-i-impressive p-p-plan.  H-h-however...""

""I'm keeping an eye on you,"" I interrupted, staring him down with no difficulty.  Something in his eyes I found disturbing, however, though I could not place what it was.

Even as I started to turn away from him, he managed to get out a single sentence without a stutter.  ""Haven't you ever wanted immortality, Severus?""

""No.""  I didn't look back at him.  ""I have no fear of death, and when my time comes I will welcome the rest.""  

My robes swept the ground of the dark forest as I left him there, cowering in fear of his own mortality."

"event","I have been teaching for a very long time, and have been <i>listening</i> for even longer.  This place is a hive of loose tongues and idle gossip, ignorance obviously as rampant in these matters as it is in everything else.

Therefore, it does not surprise me that there have been a few <i>misconceptions</i> formed about me.  I would not deign to theorize why I am of interest at all, but as it appears I am I certainly would not have expected any of these people to <i>get it right</i>.

I am not a vampire.  I prefer the dungeons because the students do not.  I wear black because my boots always match my robes.  I do not care for the taste of blood, particularly if it is my own.  And if I was immortal I certainly would not have doomed myself to teach a bunch of idiots for all of eternity.  This may be my favorite rumor, however...  I am almost impressed by its originality - but the students unfortunately already had their shot with a Dark Creature for a professor, and as he almost ate several of them he is no longer on the staff.

I am not a lonely man looking for love.  <i>Please</i>.

Along those lines, here is a list of feelings that I do not have for Harry Potter: love, lust, fondness, anything paternal, sympathy, pity, tolerance.  Here is a list of feelings I do have: loathing, mistrust, bitterness, perpetual irritation.

I am not an attractive man.  I have a big nose and greasy hair.  I understand that some of you find something intriguing in my voice; I'm afraid this cannot be helped.  The best I can do is use it to tell you what a moron you are.

There are no shackles in the dungeon.  And even if there were, they would not be employed in any sort of sexual activity.

I could make a list of people with whom I have never had any sort of sexual/romantic relationship, but I'll just make it easy for you:  if you think I have, I haven't.

I do not like you.  I assure you that this is probably the case no matter who may be reading this.  There are very few people in the world for which I have respect, and I wouldn't particularly say that I like them.

Now, feel free to continue to weave stories about me as you see fit.  They occasionally amuse me."

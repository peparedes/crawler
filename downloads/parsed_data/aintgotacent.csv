"event","if you don't know what assassin is, it's simple: 
everyone pays a dollar to sign up. on a set date, everyone recieves a squirtgun and a slip of paper with someone's name on it. that's the person they have to ""kill"". here's the catch. you have to do it when the person is mostly alone. there can only be one witness. BUT there has to be a witness. when you kill someone, they're out of the game. and they hand you their piece of paper. their hit becomes your hit. the last person left standing gets the money and the glory. 

if you're down, the first opportunity to sign up will be the 29th at the los gatos negros show. the official begin of the game will be on the 14th at the i would set myself on fire for you show."

friday night was weird. danelle loaned me 2 bux and i went to get my car and bought a 40 and stole a high life. then this guy stopped and filled my gas can the rest of the way up with a can he had in his truck. then some frat boy gave me a ride the last 10 or 12 blox to my car. fuckin awesome. i went back to the apt and downed the high life, then walked to marco's kos i was supposed to meet danelle there. when i got there, she was there, but i wasn't drunk enough for a bar at 2am so i went out to the library dumpsters and downed the cobra i'd bought. now, all i'd eaten that day was a handful of pasta and a handful of pickles, plus sunflower seeds, so you can imagine how good i felt after 24ounces of high life and 40 of cobra. it took me 8min to kill that cobra too. so anyway, i went back to the bar to find danelle kos i was supposed to stay at her house that night on account of i had to be at work at 10 the next morning and there's no alarm clock at the apt. so anyway, me, danelle and greg (the guy whose name i thought was ron) went back to her apt where her roommate immediately started being a dick to me. he bitched about me scamming food, then when i'd try to defend myself, he'd shout me down and keep talking. 2 hours and 24oz of MGD later, i was tuning him out mostly kos i was drunk and tired, but i said something about how he wasn't much different than bill o'reilly and danelle started yelling something at me. i just didn't care what was going on. i finally managed to understand her and she was going ""yer out man, yer out"", so i got up and left and sang songs at the top of my lungs on the walk home. i slept in the kitchen so i could use the oven timer and made it to work on time. when i got there, i saw danelle and she asked why i'd called her bill o'reilly and i told her i was talking to her roommate, so that explained that. then we hung out some. and i went home. last night was a sober night, which sucked, but whatever. i finished ""one hell of a candidate"" last night, then started ""tietam brown"" and finished it too. i read it in one night. it was that fuckin good. aymie just offered to take me to work out west this summer. i might go. for now, the library's closing and i need beer. have a good day.

"event","whoa nelly. i gotta stop this thing. work yesterday was lame. the copier was broken, so we did mostly nothing in the training class. then we did a little and took a ""tour"" of the building (she showed us one room). after i got off work, i went back to the apt and saw aymie. then we went and got a free papa john's pizza. then aymie went to charleston. i hope she has fun there. tony showed up and asked if i could take him to chris's house and i did. there were people there, but i didn't feel like hanging out, so i took off. i got back to the apt and sat around. i was gonna do laundry, but decided to spend my laundry money on gas and beer. i did that, and called danelle. she was cleaning and asked if i wanted to come drink my 40 with her. when i got there, she was almost done, so we sat around while she drank natty light and i drank a cobra and talked about books. after i'd downed the rest of my 40, we went to marco's. i had a decent buzz and i think she did too, so we went there and split a beer. then she told me ""the gas station stops selling beer in 15min, if yer driving, i'm buying"". yer goddamn right i did. she got miller high life and we went back to the apt again. her roommate was there, as was this guy ron she knew. her roommate seemed to have a big problem with the fact that i don't pay for food. ""it's people like me that are making food for you"". whatever buddy. if you've got a problem with it, you should stop paying for food too. we all should. that guy ron was a bit of a dick, but he was ok i guess. we were talking about jawbreaker and he said ""i used to live with this guy who was in a band that pretty much ripped off jawbreaker. have you heard of the connie dungs"". holy shit that was the coollest thing he said all night. i talked about my love for mutant pop and he said ""yeah, tim chandler stayed at our house for like a week one time"". i liked him a little better after that but he was still pretty lame. anyway, danelle was pretty insistent that i stay there and sleep on the couch, but i was drunk and wanted to go home. so after a brief confusing conversation about when i should call her ""i go in at 11:30 tomorrow and i get done at 11:15"" (now that i'm sober i remember she has 2 jobs), i left. the drive home was easy enough. when i got back to the apt, it was empty. so i sat around, wrote some and then went to sleep. this morning, i woke up, and tried to go sell plasma, but i can't do it till tomorrow. i don't have much gas, so i parked back at the apt, walked here and will walk to work. hopefully, i can make it back to the plasma center tomorrow before i run out. we'll see i guess.

i brought my notebook, but i don't feel like sharing,

"event","whooooo. here we go again.
yesterday, work lasted two hours. i showed up an hour late with a lameass excuse and they didn't give a shit. two of the people in my training class commented to each other that ""have you smelled that guy? he smells like beer"" yer goddamn right i did. rantalogic. anyway. david p.s. mullen and i are starting a record label. we discussed it the other night at marley's. i'm buying everything we'll need to make records, he's doing the same for cd's. we're calling it jewel city records kos huntington's the jewel city. i'm not crazy about the name, kos i'm not from here, but whatever. it's just a name. anyway. i have to go to work soon. i'm not too crazy about that. so last night, i hit marco's for the special. no one was there though. so i ended up sitting alone at the bar downing beers. superman and travis (emo rain man) were there on and off though. i called danelle and she was supposed to show up at some point, but when i left, there was no sign of her. i'll probably see her at work though. i woke up this morning and came here. i don't feel much like typing the rest of this.

next time, i'll bring my notebook.

"event","ah. yes. here we are again. welcome to all the things i find deplorable about you.
so this is what it's come down to. another tuesday. here we go with the recap.
i'm blurring the lines between art and a journal. i never remember to bring what i've written with me so i have to make it up as i go along and that's the best i think. sunday after matt and i left here, we went back to the apt (still forcefully occupied by us against the will of the tyrannical landlord, landlord the hun.) and sat around. we toyed with the idea of going to the house show in lexington but we were all broke and couldn't buy the gas. fuck the oil war. sunday night was my first sober night since i've been here. no one had the cash for 40's, so we all sat around and watched adult swim and entertained ourselves. monday when i woke up, i drank a juice i'd stolen from big bear and went to sell plasma. they almost wouldn't let me do so kos my arms were so fucked up from last time. it's their fuckin faults though. bastards. while i was there, about 15min to go, phil showed up. i finished then waited around on him. then we went to rio grande kos he had a buy 1 get one free meal ticket. it's JUST LIKE el azul. seriously. i even got the vegetarian number 6 just like at el azul. it was crazy. phil and i split the cost of the meal we paid for, so i guess i bought food for the first time since i've been here. weird feeling. then it was back to the apt to hang out. the we watched wrestling. marco's switched to 21+ kos somebody got stabbed there, so i took phil home and hit the bar for men's night. i sat around all night drinking and talking. pretty much what always happens at the bar i reckon. sat around and talked to danelle for a bit. then after last call, i went home. last call here isn't till 3. that's good. i slept as soon as i hit the apt. today i went and scammed taco bell, then came here. i have to start my new job in a bit. at 3 i guess. i don't wanna go, but i need beer tickets and selling plasma is about to stop being a viable option for me. i don't like needles and i don't like having a lowered immune system. ah well. it pays for the beer, so i guess it's not all bad. i feel pretty cheery today. i don't know why. huntington's done that for me. improved my disposition. the music that plays in my head has even gotten happier. no more jawbreaker. HA! HA! HA! get it? tonight is quarter pitcher night at marley's, so you can guess where i'll be. anyone from ky should come. i'll be there about 11:30 till close so we can hang. 18+. but you fuckers won't come. not even for cheap rolling rock. anyway, this is the end of this one and i hope you don't choke.
people who i like but whose email addresses i don't have should email me at lusyphur@punks.org. i need to maintain contacts. crazy people at the library are awesome.

i believe in something, but i don't know what it is. it's either the future or the end. it's every reason that i do or don't get out of bed.,

"event","so i'm back in huntington. mom kicked me out friday night. she told me i had ""till sundown tomorrow night"" to get outta her house. so here i am. huntington. i'm livin with aymie and tony. i've got my own room, but due to the last people who were there not paying their part of the rent, we may be evicted soon. anyway: an account of what's happened so far...
last night, i got here, hung out with tony for a bit, then went to a show at marley's. got drunk, watched a couple good bands (and some not so good one) and other shit. also, matt and i started talking to this girl who was alone. turns out, her name was trisstessa and sesame street live was in town, and she was the costume designer. she got our names and told us if we wanted to come, we'd be on the guest list. totally awesome. today, we woke up, got awake, then went to see sesame street live. she'd put down ""matt belville +8"" on the list. since there were only 4 of us, we gave our extra tickets to a single mother with 2 kids who'd come to buy theirs. we watched that. then, during intermission, she tracked us down and gave us huge bags of cotton candy. she's awesome. i'm suppsed to go pick her up at 10:30 to hang out some more. now, i'm at this guy's house who has decided to host raw parties on mondays. we're so 1998. sundays in wv and you can still buy alcohol. that's awesome. tomorrow: sell plasma, get my id switched, look for a job. tuesday.... i don't know. this could be a great thing for me, or i could have totally fucked up. we'll see i guess. i feel kinda homesick, but i reckon i'll get over it. i hope so anyway.

email me please. i'll try to check it tomorrow or tuesday or wednesday. or thursday."

"event","so to recap since the last entry: cider, guinness, rum, beer, rum and beer, plumbers convention, new roommates, leaving without a sound, head-on collision, broken rib, huddle house, other shit.

now the non-vagued up version:
yesterday, i left for huntington. got there, met my new roommates and drank cider with them. they're all pretty cool. except for aymie. she sucks. oops! did i say that? i hope she doesn't read this. anyway, we went to a ""private"" show at a plumbers convention, drank some more, saw some cool people, i got a couple leads on some jobs, smoked some pot, then left. i slept on a hardwood floor last night. not good for my pointy ass hipbones, that's for sure. so anyway, this morning, i woke up before anyone else and walked down to my car for some reason. when i got there, i decided to go see the city. while doing that, i ended up on the interstate, called some people, then decided to go to my mom's to get my tv. on the way, about the time i got to louisa, i pulled out at a green light, and GOT FUCKING HIT HEAD-ON! fucking bitch ran a red light. i had a witness though, so it's totally gonna be her fault. my car is sorta driveable. it runs, but there's a knocking sound and i have no front driver's side lights. this makes left turns interesting. i get home to mom's, and all she can talk about is how she's not giving me any money. this hurt my feelings, so i grabbed my tv, told her to fuck off, and left. i went to lisa's real quick to say hi, and realized just how badly my chest and neck hurt. she convinced me to go to the hospital. we went, and after a longass wait, my x-rays revealed that i had broken a rib. my neck is sore as fuck but it's fine. they gave me a percocet and a prescription for loricets which i plan to get filled tomorrow. it was all free kos i was in an accident. thank god. i have no insurance or anything. i was planning on heading back to huntington tonight, but the doctor said there's no way in hell i can drive, and he's probably right. so here i am. stuck back in eastky. fuckin bitch is what it is. after the hospital, lisa and i went to huddle house, and she took me home. my mom apologized for everything and let me stay here, AND offered to partially fix my car. i'll pay her back whenever all this shit with the insurance gets settled. so, say, 6 years from now or so. my chest hurts pretty bad. i'm gonna be sore tomorrow. i may try to make it back to huntington tomorrow or tuesday. there's more but i can't remember it all.

that's all you need to know. or
a police statement's not gonna tell you much, but i think it'll say all it needs to.
the thing is, i don't think a person's worth should be measured in the value of their life, but rather by what they did before they died. i think the most important people are those who intentionally set themselves on fire. i can't even begin to imagine that sort of horrifying beauty. having seen something like that, could you ever light up the same way again? you wouldn't hold that lighter so close, no sirree. what a shame. if i'm gonna see you burn, yer gonna need to hold it closer. here, let me help you. there. see? closer is better. light it that way from now on. this one isn't about the people you'll think it is. see, breaking that third wall is necessary most times. in fact i think it might even be important. pin a medal on it, not for honor, but as a kind of placeholder. i may need to go back to that place later. i'm taking a cross coutry drive in the rain. i won't stop till i'm minnesoaked. i won't stop till there's no more country and the sun is out. i won't stop at all probably. canada was a much better idea. what a bunch of pussies we were. scared shitless. watch a movie instead. tomorrow i drive, tonight i write. tomorrow, outward, tonight, inward. you see, it's the way it should be. balance. no one does that anymore. remember when you would get yer height measured and you'd always try to stand on yer tip-toes? what's the cutoff age for that, i think i'd like to start doing it again. first i'm gonna grow 9 foot toes, then i'm gonna build a paul bunyan myth for myself. tell them all i chopped down mountains of men with a sharp wit and a boot to the faces of their children. i like to fight old women and kids. they lay down and shut up easier. bring me a 6 year old elderly woman with arthritis and i'll crush her face. bring me something else too. i'm not sure what else i need. i'm serious. breaking the third wall again serious. don't fuck."

""so you don't eat meat kos it's murder, but do you support abortion?"" ""yeah, i think there's a huge difference between taking something out of someone and killing something that's already out and alive, it's"" ""how can you support that? i can't imagine how anyone can make that conclusion. how do you do it?"" ""well, as i was saying, i think it's not murder if it's a fetus"" ""it's still a human being and it's a baby and it's flat-out murder"" ""well"" ""well let me ask you this, do you believe in the bible?"" ""not really, i don't think it's"" ""oh you will. wait and see. you will."" and so it went. at my dad's. i was looking forward to spending the night hanging out with my step-brother, but he left and went to see his other family. i spent the night watching nwa:tna instead. i woke up thursday morning, and went to my mom's parents. it was good to spend the afternoon talking to my cousin john. i like him alot. probably the only one i can relate to in the family. i wish we could have talked more though. speaking of not eating meat, i've not had any since i was 19, and that side of the family STILL thinks it's a great joke to offer me some. ""hey, you want some turkey? here, try some of this turkey. you want me to bring you some turkey? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"" and on and on. i left early, came back, and laid around. today, my mom was in a horribly bitchy mood. i left and spent the day hanging out with lisa instead. tomorrow, i'm going to huntington. i hope there's someone at aymie's apt when i get there. otherwise, i'm gonna feel dumb. i never did get to meet her roommates. it'll probably be really awkward. if they don't like me, i reckon i'll sleep in my car till something better can be figured out. i'm not above a car-bed. first priority when i get there: finding a job. second priority: finding a library. everything else is in the background till i get these things done.

this ended up being a rather long entry.
also, please join this. i need to get the points so i can get to a level four and view adult content. thanks.

"event","""you've told us how he was, but really, <u>how was he?</u>"" you'll get that look you always get when discussing something unpleasant, but you should tell them, ""he had a passion hotter than fire and deeper than hell. he was very vulgar like that"". this will make them more disappointed in me than you ever were. ""he wasn't much"" they'll say. it's what you don't tell them that'll be important. don't tell them i did anything triumphant, <i>charming</i>, creative, or symbolic. they won't believe you anyway. all they'll see is wasted potential. ""he wasn't much"" they'll say. i won't be around to hear you agree.

the years will pass like so many mantras. you'll live to forget, i'll live to regret, and in the end, they're both one and the same. i'll wish they could make us inseperable, you won't wish for anything at all. that's the way it always goes. i wasn't much."

"event","""this isn't fast enough"" she told me. ""i need something better. something i can dance to."". picking myself up, i started another story. this time about a dead ghost with a god complex who went to heaven to see the real thing. she shook her hips, but her heart wasn't in it. it was like that sometimes. most times actually. so the facade went on. me telling a story i didn't want to tell. i had much more important things to say. her dancing and twirling, with that blank look. i mostly tried to look at the floor. that's the way it was most times. i just kept my head down. if i made too much eye contact, i'd probably say something stupid. she had an insecurity thing. if i made toomucheyecontact, she'd probably get nervous. it was best that way. and so the night went. sometimes i think it was a tremendous waste of time. sometimes i think it was a fitting way to spend a few hours. mostly, i just think. that's probably a dangerous thing."

"event","today's been weird. a few things have been troubling me. went to huntington, wanted to go see aymie's apt, but no one else did, so it was the mall, then home. shit what a day. i can't get shit off my mind. also i saw fake lottery tickets. they were a gag type thing. they win like a million dollars every time. that's horribly insensitive and cold hearted. i'd probably cry if someone did that to me."

"event","Petunia carefully stacked the last plate in the cupboard, closed the door, and ran her slightly damp washcloth over the sink to fend off any water spots.  Dishes finished, she pulled out the sponge and disinfectant for her nightly wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces.  Pulling on her gloves, she paused a moment to wonder if it might be overkill to do this so often.

No, better safe than sorry.

When the doorbell rang, Petunia didn't bother pausing in her work.  It was rare that there was a visitor for her, especially at this time of night.  She heard Vernon yelling about it as he went to answer and Harry thudding down the stairs, and only paused in her work when she heard the strange voice say he had come for Harry.  She dropped her sponge and moved to the closed door, listening to get a better idea of the situation.  Troubled Times?  Well.  After what Harry had told her the previous year of Voldemort's return, it was hardly a surprise.  And if one of <i>them</i> thought it unsafe to linger on the doorstep of a muggle home, especially with all the wards and nonsense that were supposed to be cast here, it really was not a comfort.  Giving her housecoat a tug to ensure it was secure, she decided it was time to see what was going on.

""Ah, and this must be Petunia.""

A tall, thin man whose sliver hair and beard reached his waist stood in her front hall next to her sputtering husband.  Harry stood at the foot of the stairs, watching them.

""Albus Dumbledore.  We have corresponded, of course.""

She nodded.  It may have been over a decade and a half since, but she could hardly forget those letters.

""And this must be your son Dudley?""

A twinge of fear ran through her as she noticed her son was there as well.  Not all magic might be bad, but Dudley certainly hadn't been given any exposure to the decent side.  

She stood with her family, asessing the situation, as Dumbledore made himself at home and settled in Vernon's chair.  He sent the sofa crashing into them, then pulled it back into position sharply as if it were some involuntary amusement park ride.  Petunia realized then the type of magical encounter this was going to be, and decided it best to remain silent and avoid drawing unneeded attention.

This was not an effective plan, she realized as the glass of some unknown substance began bumping against her head.  Petunia missed Bar all the more now -- she would occasionally serve something more alcoholic than Petunia would prefer, but always to help her cope, and never was it forced.

Doing her best to ignore the attacking beverage, Petunia listened carefully to Her nephew's conversation with Dumbledore.  It was clear they weren't to be taking an active part in it, so the man must have some reason for ensuring they heard it.  Vernon's interest at the mention of gold and property gave her an idea of what it might be, but the news of the death of Sirius Black was what caught Petunia's attention.  She hadn't known the man well by any stretch, but Lily had introduced him some time back.  He seemed nice enough, despite an awful pranking streak that explained his friendship with that Potter boy.  She felt a pang for Harry, realizing the cause behind his poor mood in the past weeks.  This didn't last long, as the increasing attack of her glass had reached the point that she had to shield herself from the beating.

She was worried that Vernon's outburst might have a negative effect, but for a refreshing change it worked, and the glasses vanished.  As soon as that attack had ceased, another began -- with a loud <i>crack</i>, Dumbledore called in some hideous filthy creature.  She couldn't hold back the shriek of horror at this nasty thing -- the waitrats, at least, had been clean and well-mannered.

Quiet observation remained her best option, though she couldn't help the occasional wince -- <i>why</i> hadn't Vernon listened when she asked to have the shag carpeting replaced with something that didn't hold the dirt as firmly?

She kept it up for over ten minutes, even during the horribly awkward period when Harry went up to pack his things and Dumbledore spent the time humming in a disturbingly cheerful way.  It wasn't until after Harry's return that she felt any need to speak up.

""As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a year's time --""

She may not have been the most attentive of aunts, but even she saw the error. ""No.""

""I'm sorry?""

""No, he doesn't.  He's a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders doesn't turn eighteen until  the year after next.""

Dumbledore gave the standard explanation to anything magical -- they simply did things <i>differently</i> there.  Petunia couldn't figure out why he then started going on about how Harry came to live with them, all just the same rubbish they'd always known.  It was almost as if he were summarizing their lives for some unseen audience.  There was a sinister undertone, and she instinctively shifted closer to her family.  And then his words sank in.

"". . . The best that can be said is that he at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the poor boy sitting between you.""

Petunia's cheeks flushed red, and her eyes were fixed on her hands.  She barely took in the rest of what Dumbledore had to say -- something about ensuring Harry would be allowed to stay a bit longer next year, not that she had any intention of allowing otherwise.  Harry left with him, and after a frozen moment Vernon announced that they should all head off to bed put it out of their minds.  Dudley agreed, but Petunia sat alone on the couch for some time after.  The man was as much a prat as every one of the magical types she'd encountered in this world, but he had struck home on one point.

Dudley.  

Dear god, she was a horrible mother."

"event","After her trip to Milliways, it had taken Petunia a few days to fully snap back to her old routine, but she had managed it well.  

The first day had been lovely -- dinner had been over, but she surprised everyone by preparing a small pudding as a late snack.  Nothing fancy, she hadn't had time to shop for ingredients beforehand, but she just had to do something after missing them so.  All of them -- she had even snuck a small dish of it for Harry, who had been surprised but hadn't questioned it.  

The next day, she celebrated properly by cleaning the house.  Every carpet vacuumed, every piece of furniture polished, every window washed, and even the fridge had been cleaned out.  

The third day, she weeded the garden and - politely - had Harry mow the lawn.  Dudley could have used the exercise, but she didn't entirely trust him to do it properly. Her nephew hadn't noticed anything amiss, and if either Vernon or Dudley had seen a change nothing had been said.

The fourth day, she looked around and realized that the house was still immaculate, the lawn and garden flourished enough to remind her why it had been so easy to fall for the bogus award announcement the prior year, and without help moving the ladder she couldn't start on the gutters or attic or any of the other hard-to-reach areas.  Vernon was at work, Dudley had gone off with his friends, and Harry had headed out for a walk some time earlier.  Vernon had told her that morning that he'd be bringing home a pizza as a show of appreciation for the extra effort she'd shown, so she couldn't even get a head start on dinner.  A double shame, as even with his progress the snack would hardly help Dudley with his diet.

She had nothing to do but think.

Milliways.  They told her when she arrived that she was supposed to learn a lesson or change or some such nonsense as that.  But what did she learn?  She'd made a few casual friends, though none were really much closer than Mrs. Next Door or Mrs. Number Seven.  It sank in that she didn't really have any close friends, even at home.  Yvonne had been a dear friend, but they hadn't had a chance to get together and chat in years.  Christmas Card friends, that was all she really had -- you'll send out a nice note with the annual card, offer a kind word if you encounter them on the street or in a store, but that was it.

Perhaps something to do with magic?  It played pranks on her, she knew that.  And those who had it had no qualms about making her look the fool.  But it could also have decent forms, helpful forms.  Preparing and serving food, cleaning, offering aid to those who needed it.  Not that she'd seen anything of that sort outside of the bar.  Giving her son a pig's tail when the boy hadn't done a thing?  Tearing out the window from Harry's room and not doing a thing to fix it?  Blasting dust and bits of plaster all over the living room?  Causing Dudley's tongue to swell up so horribly he nearly choked to death?  A Dementor attack on Dudley, on their own street? Inflating Vernon's sister and causing her to float away?

Well.  Petunia wasn't <i>entirely</i> upset about the last one, and had laughed about it afterward when she was alone in the house.  But considering the rest, on top of the events that brought Harry to stay in the beginning . . . she could hardly be blamed for acting as she did.

Working in the kitchens with Gil was nice.  The waitrats had been quite friendly and helpful, once she got past the fact that they were, well, <i>rats</i>.  She felt quite proud about some of the lovely pieces she had knit.  And she could never say a word against Bar.

Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad, she thought, if the door were to open back for her, from time to time."

"event","*Petunia walked through the living room with her watering can.  This summer was going even worse than the last, the hosepipe ban being strictly enforced.  Even still, she always snuck water to keep her Zantedeschia Albo maculata healthy.  A fine plant added to the immaculate room.  She checked the saucer under it, just in case -- there wasn't enough spare water to let it spill through, but it didn't hurt to check.  Task completed, she returned to the kitchen to put the finishing touches on dinner.  Her Diddlykins still had to stick to the horrid diet.  At least the school nurse was allowing her to make him a decent meal these days, if not in the portions he deserved.

She went up to her nephew's room to make sure he came for dinner.  Those strange thugs who stood up for him at the train station were sure to be after her if they kept him there, but he stayed in bed most of the time now, only leaving his room when needed.  It was a bit worrying when she thought about it, but he was keeping out of Vernon's way and that was the importaint part.

Soon enough, dinner was underway. Diddykins was enjoying his meal, but Harry was picking at his food -- a bit odd, as he tended to gobble up whatever was put in front of him, as if he were constantly starved.  Well, <i>his</i> people would take care of that when they took him back, and they couldn't say she didn't give him a good meal.

Vernon finally broke the general silence*

""Pass the brown sauce.""

*It was nearest Harry. Every eye in the room was on him, as he stared blankly at a salt shaker. Vernon's voice raised, temper getting the better of him*

""Boy, I said pass the brown sauce."" 

*Harry started and looked up.*

 ""What?"" 

""Pass the ruddy brown sauce I said!"" 

*Harry passed it along, looking numb all the while and then stared at the salt shaker again.  Vernon eyed him beadily*

""Eat! I don't want those ruddy freaks of yours mad at us because you're thin as a rail!""    

""I'm not hungry."" 

""I don't care if you're hungry!"" 

*Vernon's face started to go red with annoyance and his mustache bristled.*

""I don't want those people showing up at my house because--""

""I don't want any food."" Harry was starting to get annoyed now. 

""--my great idiot of a nephew is starving himself off like some ponce--""

""I'M NOT BLOODY HUNGRY!"" 

*Every glass on the table shattered into pieces, and Harry stood up, his face still as blank as before as they all looked at him in shocked silence.*

""I'm going to my room."" 

*He disappeared into the hall, walking slowly. Almost mechanically -- what were they doing to him at that <i>place</i>?*

""A wretched nuisance, that boy is!"" Vernon muttered furiously, as he stood and wiped at his shirt with a towel. ""Should have left him to the streets! Got to go soak this or it'll stain.""

*as Vernon walked out of the kitchen, Petunia sighed, hopes of a peaceful dinner dashed.  Might as well do the whites, since his shirt needed to be taken care of. Dudley polished off his plate, only slightly dissapointed after two years not to recieve seconds. Petunia went to the hall where she had left the laundry basket of carefully folded coloureds, picking up the basket and walking through the door.  With unexpected results."

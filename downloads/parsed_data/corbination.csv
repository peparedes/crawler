Congrats on all the recent success, surfer chick!  And I hope you're feeling better, simple anatomy - you got sick on my birthday of all days - or atleast that's when you wrote about it.  Sarah, you're a nerd.

Good day to all.

I have a midterm in chemistry at 10am tomorrow morning.  I've decided to crank out the HW that's also due, right now, and then go straight to bed...by 10:30 if possible...and then study for about 3 hours before the test in the morning.

Yeah, so, since that was pretty much the only place I'd get my L to the J on, it's pretty hard to keep this thing current.  Ok, back to the firing:  it was actually a blessing in disguise!  I really wasn't happy there anyway.  I was working with a bunch of idiots and dead-end-job middle managers and it was bringing me down!  Plus, I wasn't making the kind of money that I deserve to make...it was more than most, but still not enough.

New plan:  I'm going back to school (RCC) to get my RN (in Luke Skywalker voice:  ""like my sister before me"").  Yeah, I'm gonna be Gaylord Focker!  But that's totally cool with me.  I need to take 5 courses to get in/apply to the program though...a couple Anatomy/Physiology courses, chemistry, psychology, and something else.  I should be able to knock em out somewhat easily before next Feb when I have to apply for the program. 

I got an Ipod mini.  Pink.  It's fucking rad!  I got the 6gig one so I guess it can hold approx 1500 songs or so.  I'm downloading to it right now.  It makes my gym experiences ever so pleasant!  

I'm currently going to the gym twice a day.  Usually once in the morning before work (I'm a sub teacher in Riverside) and then in the afternoon after work.  So far I don't have a job today - and I'm kinda cool with that actually.  Just relaxing and enjoying the days as they were intended to be enjoyed.  

My diet has been impeccable the last couple weeks or so.  I bought a grip of supplements the other day at this rad little shop, Universal Nutrition, that's in the little businesses off Linden, behind GrandMarc.  I got some great protein mix, amino acid stuff, amongst other things.  I think I will be bigger and more muscular than I've ever been by this summer!  It's really fun working towards this goal!

Other than that, I'd just like to say, ""Hello"" to everyone who reads my journal and to wish everyone a happy Thursday!"

This weekend is gonna be f.u.n..  I don't really have a good abbreviation for that.  Maybe someone else does.  And, do I need the period at the end of that first sentence; after the abbreviation?  I thought I might.  

Diane is gonna pick me up after work on Friday and we're gonna go get her hair cut at Holly's salon...that's assuming she calls me back!  What the fuck!?!  I spoke to her yesterday and she said she'd call me today.  Well.  That hasn't happened yet.  Anyway, assuming that's the plan, I think we're gonna stay out at the beach for a while.  Damn, I'm definitely on lifetime record pace (if that makes any sense at all - fuck it, I don't care) for beach trips this year.  Ok, I do care.  What I meant was that I'm on pace to go to the beach more times this year than I've been cumulatively in my lifetime.  Better.

Saturday, Kelly (drummer for The Randies) is having a bbq at his place.  After that, I figure I'll head by Tremors and check in with Bill to make sure that everything is set for the show that night.  I'm sure it will be.  That place is a well-oiled machine these days.  Diane and I are gonna go check out the Wallace show for a second and then swing back to Tremors to catch as much of the sets as we can.  The final bill:

1.  Bang Sugar Bang (L.A.)
2.  The Amateurs (San Fran)
3.  The Randies (L.A.)

"event","Yesterday was cool.  It went like this:  woke up around 1, she didn't even hesitate, to call...yeah, anyway...let's see how many got that - it's actually really easy.  Um, so, I woke up about 8 am and did a load of laundry and went to the gym when it opened at 9.  After that, got home and made an egg white omelet and toast.  I think I'm dangerously close to overdosing on egg white omelettes lately.  Think I'll have one tonight!  Word!  Diane came over close to noon.  She brought two movies:  Sabrina (Hepburn & Bogart) and Elf (Ferrell).  We watched Sabrina.  It was pretty good.  I'm not really scared of black and whites as much as I used to.  We took a brief intermission so I could make her an omelet and toast.  It's the theme here, kids.

After the movie we went to the Olive Garden (It was Lovely.  I can't help it) in MoVal for a few drinks because Diane was craving a frozen tira misu.  Is that the second time I've written about that damn drink in my journal?  We stayed there for about $20 or so and then went to visit Domenic and Winde.  Dom and I went to Stater's for Jim Beam and Kettle One and left the girls to watch Newlyweds (my most guilty pleasure, btw).  We got back and attempted to play a drinking game to the movie Elf.  Rules:  drink every time the words, ""Santa"" and ""Christmas"" are spoken.  We started feeling it right out of the gates!  I don't think we made it more than an hour into the movie.  I don't remember.  I think it was getting old.  

Moving on.  Around 6pm, the four of us went to meet my dad and Darlene (his wife) for dinner at Joes.  I thought it went pretty well.  My dad got a chance to meet Winde and got to know Domenic better.  Dom asked me to order for him.  He's full blood [hardcore] Italian by the way.  I ordered him the eggplant parmesan w/ a side of meatballs.  He was pleased.  My dad didn't have any wine with dinner which was a nice change.  Apparently he got in trouble with Darlene for driving intoxicated a few days back and was on restriction.  

That's where I'm going to stop the story.  I'm getting tired of trying to be witty and failing today.  It's kind of hard to be witty when I'm just recalling events anyway.  Happy Monday to all!"

shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints.  We spend 
more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less.  We have bigger houses 
and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time.  We have more 
degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, 
yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness. 

We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too 
little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too 
tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. 

We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values.  We talk too 
much, love too seldom, and hate too often. 

We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. 

We've added years to life not life to years.  We've been all the way to 
the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new 
neighbor. 

We conquered outer space but not inner space.  We've done larger things, 
but not better things.  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. 

We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.  We write more, but 
learn less.  We plan more, but accomplish less.  We've learned to rush, 
but not to wait.  We build more computers to hold more information, to 
produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. 

These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small 
character, steep profits and shallow relationships. 

These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but 
broken homes.  These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, 
throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that 
do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. 

It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in 
the stockroom.  A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and 
a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit 
delete. 

Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not 
going to be around forever.  Remember, say a kind word to someone who 
looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and 
leave your side. 

Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the 
only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. 
Remember, to say, ""I love you"" to your partner and your loved ones, but 
most of all mean it.  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes 
from deep inside of you. 

Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person 
will not be there again.  Give time to love, give time to speak, and 
give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. 

AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: Life is not measured by the number of breaths we 
take, but by the moments that take our breath away."

Not having any desire to further this discussion with this peculiar fellow, I quickly remarked, ""wow, that's ridiculous,"" and hurried up the stairs, as he was in no shape to catch me.  Upon further thought, I found myself wondering, what this whole thing was about.  Was San Francisco trying to phase out the use of these plastic shopping bags by charging their customers for them?  I may never know.

Getting plenty of sleep has proven, time and time again, to be the most contributing factor to having a good day at work.  Period.

It's approaching 9am.  I've already had my breakfast:  dad's chili.  Great source of protein and low in fat.  My next two meals are on deck in the lunch room.  It's gonna be a good day.  

I got a phone call from my boss's boss late yesterday evening.  She wanted to congratulate me on my work ethic of late.  Apparently I have 21 claims filed for the month of February as of yesterday.  Considering that the entire month of January, Smirna and I filed a total of 64, I'd say I'm on a pretty awesome pace.  I told her that I'm just trying to break records.  And it's true.  If I can't find some kind of stat related goal for myself to strive for I find it hard to get motivated. 

Last night was cool.  I went to Diane's house and we watched Old School while we baked her sister [who's away at college in WI] some cookies.  Snickerdoodles, actually.  I made a bad call and said that they were done when in actuality, they weren't.  Pretty embarrassing call, considering my tenure in the kitchen.  So, after 20 minutes or so of cooling, back into the oven they went.  ""Twice-Baked Snickerdoodles"" were born.

Plans for this evening:  drop off prescription for some eye drops that I need before my lasik eye surgery on Saturday.  Excited!  Go to the gym (big shoulders day).  And lastly relax at home and get plenty of sleep.

That feeling...the energy, the electricity, coursing through your body.  I remember it happening very often in junior high school as we gathered on the floor to watch a film.  Alex just stopped by my desk to get a closer look at my wallpaper and it happened again.  I think it's my favorite feeling in the world.  Oh, and this has nothing to do with sexuality...Alex is a guy."

"event","It's 8:30am.  I just finished paying all my bills.  I also just canceled the gas service to my old apartment.  There's a great calm that I feel when all of my tasks are complete.  Well, they're not really all complete...yet.  I still need to get all the details for the show on the 26th (I KNOW I TOLD A COUPLE PEOPLE IT WAS CANCELED - NOT TRUE - ONE BAND IS BEING REPLACED, THAT'S ALL), which has proven to be a bit of a pain so far.  More about that as it unfolds.

I just ate the last of the shrimp teriyaki bowl arsenal that I had stashed in one of the freezers here at work.  Looks like it's time to make a super market trip.  Tonight, perhaps.  I have to meet up with Ryan this evening to remove the final contents of my apartment:  my bed.  I'm not keeping it.  I need to get rid of it and the only solution I see feasible is to dump it somewhere.  I know, it's totally irresponsible and selfish to dump my property somewhere and let someone else deal with it, but at this point I think I'll allow myself one act that I'm not proud of.  I've done so well lately in so many other areas that if I don't do this I might as well apply to the clergy.

Yesterday was my first ironman day.  That's what I'm calling them.  I wake shortly after 5am and don't return home until 7:15 or so.  I go directly from the train station to the gym, on campus.  And it's fucking ""showtime"" around that hour.  There's usually a line for a treadmill by the time I finish lifting - which I hate.  I'm gonna have to run the ""OG"" run that I used to do...around campus and through a few neighborhoods.  It's a bit cold out right now but I think I'll manage.

Diane came over last night for a couple hours.  She met my dad's wife, Darlene, and basically sat and watched me talk to all the boxes and furniture in my room - that's how I get it organized; I talk to it.  Anyhow, I was pretty tired and I decided that it might set a good example with the parentals if she left early (around 9pm) since I'm not allowed to have overnight guests or guests upstairs after parent bedtime.  I hope we can find some way to hang out more!!  

Ok, there's my 15 minute journal for today.  Time to work."

"event","Thought I'd post a humorous email that I received this morning from The Sharwei.  

Tip:  ""the den"" (short for the lion's den) is the term we use to describe Jay's house and all the occupants that both live there and are semi-perminant fixtures.  This den is the second of it's kind.

The Sharwei wrote:

""I'm in right now.  Got in at 8.  Couple interesting stories.  So this is the first day I am actually walking in the base EXACTLY at 8.  Granted I have been here lots earlier and more then lots later than that...but not exactly at 8.  Why is this significant you ask?  Well they play the damn Star Spangled Banner at 8 on the dot.  And so I get out of my car and this song is playing.  Now, I would like to think I am a pretty patriotic person.  So with that being said, I start walking from the parking lot to the main gate.  I notice NO ONE else is walking, but STANDING AT ATTENTION listening to the song.  F*** ME!!!!  So I have two options:  1)  Look like an unpatriotic a-hole or 2) Look like a fucking robot.  I go with 2.  Its the safest bet with a whole bunch of officers standing around.  That sucked.

I also get into my office and I quickly proceed to the break room.  I got some good shots of the water cooler and the sign.  I won't be able to send them until I get home and d/l them to my computer.

So the den was out of control again.  I can't take this shit.  I am REALLY pissed off right now, for several reasons.  About two weeks ago I bought a brand new thing of detergent and a brand new bottle of bleach.  I go to wash my whites last night, and the bleach has like MAYBE two loads left in it? WTF???  I only used it once, and it was totally full when I used if the first time a week ago.  That is the SECOND bottle of bleach I have gone through and each one I used about ONCE!!!!  WTF again???  I left my detergent in the garage (knowing I shouldn't have grant you.  But Jay and Dean were in there a week ago and I felt that I would be a stingy a-hole if they saw me take the detergent out).  Granted, Jay is generous with his detergent, so I don't mind sharing mine with him.  But the other two guys, I don't think they have yet to buy jack S***!!!  So we had two HUGE things of detergent the other day....Dean dumped my littler bottle into one of the HUGE containers (thanks btw).  And now there is like half a HUGE container left...after a week?  WHO CAN BE DOING SO MUCH LAUNDRY WHEN I AM NOT THERE?!?!?!  There are two explanations:  1)  Someone has a lot of clothes I don't know about and goes into the backyard on a daily basis and rubs them in dirt when I am not there, 2)  Someone uses WAY TOO MUCH detergent and bleach per load.  I'm guessing its a combination of both.

The other thing that is pissing me off is that I buy food, and eat half of it.  its out of control.  I confront Jay and Will about this last night.  They deny it.  I had my last straw when I went to make my sandwiches for today, and my whole POUND of turkey meat was practically gone. I hadn't even eaten half of it.  I ask them, they deny it.  I ask them about my food in general....they said they don't eat my stuff.  Occassionally they will eat my lettuce or something.  Fine...I don't give a shit...When you buy a head of lettuce or things in quantity that you probably won't use it all....I could give a s*** about.  But things that actually you will use and then mysteriously vanish during the day when I am not there, thats BS!!!  They blamed it on Booboo.  I can see that happening.  But I can't see him eating 14 of the 18 eggs I bought.  Yeah..those are missing too.  I didn't get to open the milk or OJ I bought.  My cereal is half gone....tomatoes are gone!  F*** that!!!

The last thing is that its SOOO predictable that the den is going to come home on a wednesday and thursday night and be loud.  Like seriously....am I over reacting?  Am I the a-hole in this situation?  Or is that the most disrespectful thing they can do?  I ask them every time before they go out to be quiet when they get home?  Whats the first thing they do when they get home???  They play the bass and drums.  Last night I didn't feel like going downstairs, so I did some jumping jacks on the floor to let them know they are being too loud.  Granted last night I don't think it was the bass or the drums...it was the stereo.  But ever since Jay got that damn surround sound system with the sub-woofer, it might as well be the bass guitar.  Being drunk is no excuse for forgetting to have manners and forgetting to be respectful.  BS!!!

So I have had about enough of this shit.  I might be moving back in with my Dad for a few months.  I will be buying a condo soon.  So when I do that, and you're ready to move out, you have a play to stay.  I will be interviewing young hot college chicks for roommates too....you think I'm kidding about that?  Well I'm not.

Hmmmm....thats about all for now.  I don't know about BB's on Thursday.  I heard its a lot of wankers.....Not too cool.  Kind of how it used to be, w/o all the cool people."""

"event","Been a few since my last update.  I've been spending a lot of time with Diane lately.  I like her so much it's scary.  She says we're getting addicted to eachother.  It's really bittersweet though.  You see, she's going to grad school in a couple/few months.  I don't know exactly when; not a topic that I particularly want to discuss too much...but we've touched on it a few times.  I can see myself potentially falling for this one too.  This girl wears heels and pearls.  Yeah, we're pretty opposite...and I love it! How incredibly sad this is gonna be.

Anyway, she's picking me up at the metrolink station tonight.  I drove in today because I didn't set my alarm last night...well, I actually tried to but I was drunk and asleep so go figure.  I left my cell phone in Diane's car when I went to hang out with her for her break at work.  I left my front door unlocked and she dropped it off after work around 3am.  

So I've decided, in my infinite brilliance, that I'm gonna leave my truck in Orange tonight and avoid the traffic.  I'm getting off work an hour early tomorrow anyway (3:30pm) and I'll get a jump on the traffic then, although it's pretty much unavoidable after 2pm.  I'll get a ride to the station from her in the morning.  I love how she makes my pillows smell. 

We're going to the Olive Garden tonight for [a lovely] dinner.  Not my first (2nd, 3rd, or 4th, for that matter) choice for an italian restaurant but when you have a gift card, it makes choosing easy.  Diane already knows what she wants but I forget what it was.  We're both really good about eating healthy so the fleet of bread sticks shouldn't chink our armor too bad.  She was also talking about some kind of Tira Misu (sp) blended drink.  Desi knows what I'm talking about.  Kinda cool to read your name in my journal, huh?  

After that we're gonna watch a movie (big shocker) which allows for great cuddle time.  I'm guessing it will be one of the following:  Sabrina, Under the Tuscan Sun, Breakfast at Tiffany's (I think that's her favorite), Lost in Translation (I kinda hope it's this one), or Trainspotting.

Yep, another great evening.  And there's plans for the entire week, almost.  Next time."

"event","Ok, since I have a half hour or so before bus time I'll drop some consonants on what's going on.  Lots of big events.  Big for me.  Fuck, big for anyone.  I'd prefer to just flow and let the story tell itself.  Here:

When I get home I need to pack up all of the stuff I have in the fridge/freezer because my roommate is unplugging it tomorrow.  He's getting a Uhaul and moving the bulk of his stuff out tomorrow morning.  I had planned on staying through the month of January but I guess I'm gonna break this weekend.  I don't have to go far; just to my dad's house in Mission Grove (Cinema Star Theaters, Alessandro).  Anyhow, I'm going to take said bag of perishables up to his house.  Yeah, it's back w/ the folks for a few months - Operation save some money, pay off debt, and find new living sitch!  After that [already dressed for it] I'm gonna go to the rec center and workout the bi's and run a little bit.

After that I figure The Sharwei (aka Ryan; aka Mr. Anonymous in the LJ world; aka Mr. I better be getting my own account in my spare time at work while I'm doing jack) will come over or we'll...NOPE, just had a thought - I'll start packing up my room.  I don't have a whole grip load of stuff, which is both good and bad.  Good, for the move.  Bad, for, well, shit, I don't have anything.  

The alcoholic contents of my kitchen = 1 bottle of merlot, 1 tall can of Bud Ice, and about two drinks worth of Kettle One V.  I figure The Sharwei and I will have a few drinkies throughout the night.  I want to find another cool spot to chill at though - bar wise.  It gets a little old hanging at our same spot over and over - but the benefits are great!

So..........the current [censored] of my life gets off work at midnight tonight.  She's a manager at a major Riverside hotel.  And she's so hot!  And so smart.  She graduated Valedictorian from her H.S. and she's magna cum laude from her college in Wisconsin.  Word!  I hate that she works so late.  But if that wasn't the case we never would have met.  I'm thinking that I'll pick up a bottle of champagne for tonight.  I'm not all to big on that stuff, but she likes it.  Tomorrow morning she's taking me to breakfast at some place called Martha's [something] in Redlands.  She raves about their french toast, which I am a fan of.  I told her to bring some changes (plural) of clothes with her so not only will she have clothes for tonight but clothes for tomorrow morning too - yeah, I'm anticipating another wonderful sleep over...one where I don't have to wake up after two hours of sleep.

Ok, I'm off.  Still gotta wait for the muh'fuckin' bus though."

     So...last night's evening [date] couldn't have gone any better!  There's a new girl in Corbin's life, Mr. Sciara.  And it's Diane...change the ""a"" to an ""e.""  We had a couple cocktails at the pad and then went by Tremors.  I needed to get the show next month pushed back a week so that actually worked out well.  There were about 8 people in the bar.  I knew 4 of them.  We sat with 3 of them.  I didn't really want to spend my intro courting period with this group so I suggested we go somewhere else - besides, this girl drinks champagne and Tremor's doesn't stock it.  I decided we'd try Romano's in Canyon Crest [opting against going to Frank's].  It was [supposed to be] comedy night but we made up a quarter of the audience.  Yeah, 8 people there too...this time, including us.  Ordered two champagne splits w/ an oj back.  We watched one comic.  Really, really bad environment for comics.  8 people.  Diane chose two seats up front.  I warned her.  So anyway, this guy starts his set off by saying (to us), ""So, you guys f***ed yet?""  Yeah, that's pretty much how it went.  He wasn't really that funny.  When she went to the bathroom [between comics] the mc asked on the mic, how I got a chick like that.  I told him I didn't know.  Two people kind of laughed.  We left.  Went back to my apt and watched my favorite movie from 1984, ""Secret Admirer.""  Don't worry if you don't know what it is.  Nobody ever does.  **Flashback:  She made a comment outside Tremors upon our arrival, as I smoked a cigarette, that she wasn't going to kiss me tonight, now...because of the cigarette.  Apparently, ""that's the only bad thing about me.""**  So, anyway, back to my place; Secret Admirer, my couch.  We were getting cuddly and such.  I then told her, and I don't remember why (think it had something to do with something she said that I pretended to be upset about, in a playful way), that I was now saying that, SHE isn't getting any kisses from me...and proceeded to flip the whole thing.  Anyway, after the movie I asked her if she was staying over or going home...and added that she wasn't going to get any action or kisses.  She smiled.  She stayed.  We layed in my bed for a little while, just talking, and then it happened.  I couldn't restrain anymore.  Kisses.  Anyway, the last time I looked at the clock last night it was 2 something in the am.  I woke up at 5am this morning and here I sit.  At work.  I'm doing ok.  I think it's because I'm not hung over.  Just a little sleep deprived. Ok.  Back to work.

"event","Bush defends inauguration celebrations

By Caren Bohan
Washington
January 19, 2005

President George Bush is being attacked for splurging $US40 million ($A52.8
million) on balls, concerts and candlelit dinners while the country is in a
sombre mood because of the Iraq war and the south Asian tsunami.

As he prepares for his second-term inauguration on Friday, supporters plan to
celebrate with fireworks and several days of parties, including a Black Tie and
Boots Ball and nine other balls.

Critics say the lavish celebrations are unseemly when US troops face daily
violence in Iraq and Americans are being urged to donate money to ease the
suffering in Asia.

""I just think that the sobriety of the times dictate that we be mindful of the
imagery of these things,"" said Democratic Anthony Weiner of New York. He urged
Mr Bush in a letter to ask donors to redirect their inaugural contributions to
equipment for troops in Iraq, some of whom have complained of having to scrounge
for scrap metal to repair their vehicles.

""Precedent suggests that inaugural festivities should be muted - if not
cancelled - in wartime,"" Mr Weiner wrote. He suggested that the money could pay
for 690 Humvees and provide a $US290 bonus for each soldier in Iraq.

He cited President Franklin Roosevelt, who celebrated his 1945 inaugural with
cold chicken salad and pound cake.

Mr Bush rejected the criticism. ""It's important that we celebrate a peaceful
transfer of power . . . You can be equally concerned about our troops in Iraq
and those who suffered in the tsunami while celebrating democracy,"" Mr Bush said
in a CBS News interview. He said inauguration activities would include
military-themed events, such as a Commander-in-Chief Ball and a Salute to
Service. ""There's ways for us to honour the soldier and, at the same time,
celebrate,"" he said.

President Lyndon Johnson did not ignore pageantry in 1965, spending $US1.6
million on inaugural festivities despite the Vietnam War, historian Robert
Dallek said. The tradition of inaugural balls dates back to the swearing-in of
James Madison in 1809.

Companies and individual donors, not taxpayers, are footing the bill for the
festivities.

Political scientist George Edwards of the Texas A & M University said he didn't
fault the President's supporters for indulging in a little splendour but said
the huge donations fed a cynical view of the influence of special interests.

White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the events were a time to ""celebrate
freedom"" and ""pay tribute to our men and women in uniform""."

"event","Large office environments are cesspools of binge eating.  Plain and simple.  I've never seen so many people who have obviously gave up long ago. 

I don't say things like, ""this year will be the year.""  I don't ever make new year's resolutions.  For me, it's like the word, ""diet.""  This word is so commonly misused.  A diet is, simply, what you eat.  A panda bear's diet is bamboo.  A diet is not a temporary period of time or the act of eating right.  Now with that said, THIS YEAR IS GONNA BE THE YEAR!

I need a sharp, witty catch phrase, kids.  Something like, ""I'm alive in '05.""  I'll make t-shirts.  Who ever comes up with the best one, gets a free t-shirt.  I'm kind of serious too.

Anyway, this is the year that I'm gonna make it all come together.  I've learned a whole fuck of a lot in my lifetime.  More than [I'll so arrogantly say] most people will ever learn in theirs.  I've had many an epiphany this last year.  I feel like I'm on the verge of something.  Something big.  Today's example:  I came back from a meeting.  I'm being trained to do some new duties at my job.  I sat down at my desk, put some music on, and stared out the window.  I felt it.  The music was ultra clear.  It's like a mandolin track in a song that you've never heard before.  The magnetics of the space around me were buzzing.  Like iron to a magnet in the sandbox when we were kids.

We once referred to one of our friends as ""the stupidest smart guy"" we've ever met.  It still holds true today.  I see this guy every so often.  He's getting is PhD from UCR.  He spends most of his day with worms.  I don't think, however, he'd get one thing I've said in this entry...not that you have to understand the way my mind works to consider yourself intelligent - you just miss out on my electoral votes. 

With this said, I believe that I am the simplest complex guy I've ever met.  Sex, drugs, and rocknroll.  That's all I want!  After writing that I just realized that it couldn't be anymore accurate...and horribly fucking clique.  And that's life.

More to come..."

"event","It's christmas eve, kids.  And I'm cold, chillin at work.  A little hung from last night.  Not too bad though.  We went to see Alien again at Tremors - big shocker.  I don't even watch them anymore.  I think its a bad thing seeing a band too much.  And I'm not really liking how our local spot gets so fucking crowded at these events.  I had to pay last night too.  It was because I had too many people with me and Al wasn't about to let all 6 of us in because that comes out of his pocket since he usually takes the door.  After that, I made a drunk call (I'm totally addicted to those - giving and receiving) and headed to Del Taco.  My roommate got back to the apt about 15 minutes after me with Del Taco as well.  I got a double del cheeseburger.  WTF?  I must have been a little drunk and bored with the menu.

So we're having a dept meeting in about 10 or so.  It's almost for sure going to be about how early they're gonna let us out today.  I'm hoping for 1pm.  Sometimes they have a raffle where the first 10 names they draw get to leave at x time and the next and x + 1hour and so forth.  Last time my name got drawn like 8th or something so I was in group 1.  I'm not feeling that lucky today though.  Anyhow, after this meeting I think I'm gonna run over to get something to eat - I'm pretty hungry.  I'm working at an incredibly slow pace.  I feel like I'm stoned but I'm not.  I think it's my body recovering from last night.  

Just found out:  I have Monday off!  That's the next coolest thing to find [out] next to $5 in your pants pocket.  Fuck yeah!  I only work 3 days next week since I asked for new year's eve off.  Chris Qualls asked me if I wanted to go to San Fran for new year's.  I don't know.  I've never been and I really want to go but I'm kinda over the ""let's go somewhere big for new years thing.""  I honestly just feel like sitting around with beer and friends.  

That's all for now.  Nobody (who's journal I read) is writing lately...or atleast that much.  And that's boring for me who still has to be at work.  You only get the weekends off, kids."

"event","Ok, let us document some more bullshit so I might reflect back upon it one day with ________.  But that's pretty unlikely. 

Somebody named, Bianca, left a note on my lap yesterday evening, as I sat, sleeping, on the train ride home.  It said some stuff like, ""I've seen you before"" and that I ""look just like one of [her] bestfriends"" and a couple other breif things.  Random.  But I'd have to say that it was pretty exciting waking up to see a folded up letter, as I figure any of you who have had this happen, would tend to agree.

I watched, The Last Samurai, last night before I went to bed.  My overall opinion of it is that it was a pretty damn good movie!  I think Japanese culture is one of the finest on the planet.  It has it's bad points but the honor, respect, and discipline is unrivaled.  There were several parts of the plot, however, that were almost direct ripoffs from Braveheart and Dances With Wolves.  But all in all, a good movie.  Tom Cruise rarely, if almost never, makes a bad movie.

We're (my department - Finance) supposed to get off a few hours early today and go see a movie at the block BUT it appears (JUST IN) that it's been canceled.  Fuck!  I hate looking forward to something, especially as amazing as time off work, and having it ripped right out from under me!  We better get sent home hella early from work on Friday!

I'm done for now."

"event","Just a little something I came across today:

Dear President Bush,

Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I Have learned a great deal from you and understand why you would propose and support a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. As you said ""in the eyes of God marriage is based between a man a woman."" I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. 

When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination... End of debate. 

I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of God's Laws and how to follow them. 

1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians? 

2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?

3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanness - Lev.15: 19-24. The problem is how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.

4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? 

5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2. clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?

6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there 'degrees'of abomination?

7. Lev.21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room here?

8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die?

9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?

10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev.19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair, like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)

I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help.

Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging."

"event","Well, my friends...it appears as if I'll be sitting home alone this Friday evening.  It could be horribly depressing but I don't really look at it like that.  Maybe it'll be a good time to finish up the laundry and, ofcourse, smoke lots of pot!  We'll see...

If anyone knows of anything incredibly radical to do tonight, let me know.

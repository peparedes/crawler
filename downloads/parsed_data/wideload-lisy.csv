I hope all you uys are doing good and ive missed you so much! those days without communication to my vital people were hell i tell...HELL!!! its amazing just how important some people become, without them ure well numb (thanks for that term, it really is the best one smoochie lol) 
     Im so looking forward to friday and saturday. On friday a whole night with chris (dont be dorkalicious gen) and on saturday the day with gen and tina. It's going to be awesome my luvs!!! I hope turtle can come along, vane would but she is now tied down to smoothies and such. I have to admit...gen+car= my possible death BUT i should live on the edge after all i guess lol. 
     Recent events have made me realize that yet another one of my so called friends is lost forever. i used to think we were friends eventhough we had barely talked anymore but i was obviously oh so wrong. In the end i guess you always know who it is you can count on. i have done so much i regret and am sorry for, however, if any of the people i no longer talk to came to me i would gladly help them because i still love them. Yea..even you. 


anyways...enough rambling and ill probably update in another ten years.

oh and gen no one cares about ure frustrations with tito and christian..pfft we both kno u are waaaay worst <3"

"event","Alot has happened, and it was all very good. Then, of course, my life takes the course that, apparently, it's meant to take. At the risk of sounding suicidal and emo-like, it all goes to crap. I'm not really sure what'll go down next. Maybe nothing will, but all i know is that i'm not going to be the one to turn around and walk away. For once, and thanks to alot of great advice, i'm not going to run away. 
  The catch, however, is that i'm not really sure if whether im sticking around matters or not. With time, i guess, everything will fall into place and we'll just see what happens. Enough about this though...
  Today i'll be hanging out with Gen and Tina. I'm sure i'll have a blast, i love those two. They really do make things better for me.:D 
  I'm missing turtle so badly, he has to stop enjoying summer and stay bored with me for at least one weekend! 

p.s. Steven, sorry about not going to ur party, i hope u had a great time.

I hung out with alot of friends who are fast becoming the most special people to me, and i also hung out with those who already are the most special. The Novelties performance on friday was in one word amazing. Now on to Saturday..wow.I had a great time. I wish i wasn't so shy and retarded. It's like I overthink everything to the point that by the time i work up the guts to do it its either too late or so much less than i expected. I'll work on that though. Anywhoo..we all  saw batman Begins..some for the 22456454th time (chris), it was a good movie. I could barely concentrate the whole time,though,and it had nothing to do with Chris's non stop comments. lol.All in all, everything was awesome and i hope we all hang out again some time soon."

Chris kept ranking on me, but all is good because ha ha boy is he going to regret it lol 9and all of hialeah is all mine!!). I love the relationship Genesis and Tito have, it's so comfortable..random comment but i had to mention it. The movie was great, thanks for forcing me to see it.

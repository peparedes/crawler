"event","::Last Laugh::




As I break down crying
with inner hopes of dying.
My last thoughts of suicide.

All I can do
is watch you.
As you slit my throat aside.

The pain I once held,
the malice in which filled
my raging heart.

No longer am I
to say I got by,
without sinning.

But in the end,
at Hades' bend.
I was the one left laughing.

Tell me what you think, please? My life isn't interesting enough to get comments.. but hopefully my poetry is.."

"event","Scream until you can't anymore;
only when your body's broken.
And there you are..
Walking through that door.

All you care about,
I can't seem to save myself.
You're raging in your sins,
I'm so filled with doubt.

In and around;
the bullet falls through the air.
Without a sound:
All I can do is stare.."

"event","All alone in the dark,
all you see is the bark.
Twisting and turning,
in the air.
Just like your black heart,
filled with despair.
But as you spin,
you see the rope.
Dangling from it,
you've lost your hope.

Death be told,
wishes true.
I just wish,
this noose wasn't made by you.."

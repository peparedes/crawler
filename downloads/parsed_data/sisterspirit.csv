I'm afraid that if I don't get help I'm going to die and I'll never have known true happiness.  I'm not saying I haven't been happy.  Some days with Collin, with my family, and with Jenn have been memorable BECAUSE of how happy they made me.  I've been happy a lot in my life.  And I feel lucky for each moment I feel that way.  But the truth is, I've never had happiness IN my life.  I've never experiences the feeling of happiness that lasts more than a day or a week.  To me, happiness is when you can go to bed without worrying about how you're gonna feel tomorrow.  Happiness is when you can look at your reflection in the mirror and not think about how much you want to be happy.

I need help.  I think I'll make an appointment with JoEllen tomorrow."

"event","Step one you say we need to talk 
He walks you say sit down it's just a talk 
He smiles politely back at you 
You stare politely right on through 
Some sort of window to your right 
As he goes left and you stay right 
Between the lines of fear and blame 
And you begin to wonder why you came 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

Let him know that you know best 
Cause after all you do know best 
Try to slip past his defense 
Without granting innocence 
Lay down a list of what is wrong 
The things you've told him all along 
And pray to God he hears you 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

As he begins to raise his voice 
You lower yours and grant him one last choice 
Drive until you lose the road 
Or break with the ones you've followed 
He will do one of two things 
He will admit to everything 
Or he'll say he's just not the same 
And you'll begin to wonder why you came 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life"

Crazy how you make it all alright, Love 
Crush me with the things you do 
And I'd do for you anything too 
Sitting, smoking feeling high 
In this moment, oh, it feels so right 

Lovely Lady 
I am at your feet, oh
God I want you so badly 
I wonder this 
Could tomorrow be So wondrous as you there sleeping 
Let's go drive 'till morning comes 
Watch the sunrise and fill our souls up 
Drink some wine 'till we get drunk 

It's crazy I'm thinking 
Just knowing that the world is round 
And here I'm dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down?
And is this real or am I dreaming?

Lovely lady 
Let me drink you please 
I won't spill a drop no I promise you 
Lying under this spell you cast on me 
Each moment 
The more I love you 
Crush me 
Come on 

It's crazy I'm thinking 
Just knowing that the world is round 
And here I'm dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down?
Is it real or am I dreaming? 

Lovely Lady 
I will treat you sweetly 
Adore you 
I mean you crush me 
It's times like these 
When my faith I feel 
And I know how I love you 
Come on 
Lady 

It's crazy I'm thinking 
Just as long as you're around 
And here I'll be dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down?
To each other we'll be facing 
By love, by love
We'll beat back the pain we've found 
You know 
I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking deep inside 
My friend 
With each moment the more I love you 
Crush me 
Come on 
Baby

So much you have given love 
That I would give you back again and again 
Meaning I'll hold you 
But please, please, just let me
Always."

It's pretty hard to forgive someone when they never ask for your forgiveness.  Religion tells us that forgiveness gets you into heaven.  All you have to do is confess your sins and God forgives you.  And if there is no confession, you just go to hell.  Why shouldn't that be the same on earth as well?  Forgive those who ask, forget those who don't.  

Sometimes I forget I even have a father.  He's merely existed in this world for years now.  At least when he hit us or yelled at us we knew we got to him somehow.  Now, I don't think anything gets to him.  Mom says she's happy, but no one can be happy in the house of misery.  I was just the only one who bled from it."

"event","i fear that i have no life

despite what my peers say

i think im like one of those basement geeks

that only come out when they are hungry or have to poop

sigh

theres alot mroe that i WOULD write

but i decided not to

so here is a song

that i have listend to constantly for the past 2 hours

it made me think alot about a SOS

Smiles and her laughter
It's the only thing that I've been waiting for a time
Regardless of our distance and our hope...grows greater
Trapped by pretty eyes and letters for all time
...the only thing that I've been waiting for.

I hope it's something worth the waiting
'Cause it's the only thought that I ever feel real
Thunder storms could never stop me
'Cause there's no one in the world like Emily

She's simple yet confusing
Her sparkling eyes make me weak at my words, they tremble
Days seem like years in this month of December
The winter coldens me for I have yet to sleep
And never will I give up trying 'cause you're everything to me

I hope it's something worth the waiting
It's the only thought that I ever feel real
'Cause thunder storms could never stop me
'Cause there's no one in the world like Emily,
There's no one in the world like Emily.

i feel rather bad right now..i pretty much screwed up alot this week..its amazing how much damage one person can do.<br>
i want to accept people's help..and talk about problems..but i just cant seem to do it.<br>
its like theres a barrier that prevents me from doing it.<br>
maybe its the fact that i feel like ill be judged on everything i say<br>
or people will veiw me diffrently if i tell them whats on my mind<br>
i just want everything to go back to the way it was before..<br>
when i was happy and liked myself..<br>
and when i could tell my best friend whats on my mind<br>
and when guys didnt part people<br>
i dont want morgan to feel shitty on my account.<br>
i dont want her to ruin her friendship with paul<br>
not ever<br>
she is prolly the only person i can really talk to about stuff...<br>
and not feel like she'll hate me<br>
or think im weird<br>

"event","someone apparently is jealous that he or she did not get to touch 3 Bubba Sparxxx's posse's hands....(HINT: I AM BEING FUCKIN SARCASTIC!!)

i know over the internet you cannot detect sarcasm, but when anyone states a ridiculous statement like yours truly did, before your self-centered mind goes into hyper-overload, sit back, think and realize that ""why would anyone actually be proud of this?"" and i guarantee before you can even finish the question in your head you will realize that this person is most definitely being sarcastic.... then when you come to that conclusion you can laugh along with it INSTEAD of posting an anonymous response saying an immature statement.

whoever this is, come talk to me in person about any problems that you may have, we'll have some tea and crumpets... and discuss either your homophobia or jealousy over not being able to touch Bubba's posse's hands

and i am sure i can narrow down mr. anonymous to a handful of people

by David J. Thomas

you pedal proudly
through streets indifferent,
flags fluttering your presence
in the Fantasy in Lights Parade,
at the Italian Festival,
near the Sixteenth Street Convenient--
vigilantly keeping watch
over this, your city,
as if a younger sibling;
florescent orange vest
spelling out your pseudonym--
a remembrance to gawkers.

but who is it you seek
beyond that cow-eyed stare?
who knows where you live?
who knows your given name?
who sees into who you are?
is it the blind man Lou
who guards the concession stand
in the lobby of the City-County Building
where you usually loiter--
your home away from Grandview Manor?

and then one day someone will, I guess,
wonder aloud about where you have gone
and in silence regret your absence
with belated compassion only

Do you ever just feel numb, I mean your whole entire self just seems unable to feel? 

There is so much to see in this world and oh so little time in life to see it. I guess that is why we have dreams; to see the things we are not and won't be able to ever see. 

In my twenty-two times around the sun, I have loved, I have lost, I have smiled, I have cried, I have laughed, I have felt life's highs and felt its lows, and do not regret anything that I have done, seen, or felt. Some memories I wish to erase but you cannot, so you just accept them as part of your life's history. You will have to climb hills and pass through valleys in this journey.

We are who we choose to be...

Liars lie,
Cheaters cheat
And they can never change that.

Life's Paradox: We can never be perfect yet we strive for perfection.

Change is inevitable(except in vending machines). 


""I cannot bring myself to say it. It's my own advice I need.""

I think we sometimes get caught up in everyone else's drama, everyone else's business when really we need just to focus on our self. But you will always have those who cannot help but talk about other people  even when they do no know all the facts. It is a shame. I guess it is a flaw we as humans have and I don't see it ever changing... people seem to want to know ""everything"" about everything when most of the times it is none of their business. Oh well! Me writing this will not change how people think or act, certain people are always willing to add some drama to the play of life... I guess they cannot help it for some reason.

Do no care what people think about you. People are idiots. Especially in the masses. Be yourself, be who you want to be and not what they want you to be; be true, be honest, and be faithful. Life is rough for everyone, but work hard in it and it will all work out.

Love is an enigma that is wrapped inside a puzzle."

Somedays I forget to think about him and I feel horrible about it. But the reason for that is that when I don't think about him I consciously I forget that he is dead and subconsciously my life is what it was before Decemeber 7th, 2003. Because before that day, he was in the Navy and I was in college and that is where I would like to think he is still, over seas on some battleship training.( Does that make sense to anyone? I probably could have worded that better)But any hoo...I want/need to think about him. He was a big part of my life... in fact he still is. I have lost touch with his spirit I think... I hope he forgives me for not keeping in touch with his family as much as I should and said I was going to.

I remembered, what would have been, his 22nd birthday is coming up shortly... I know he wants me to be happy and I am but still deep down I will always be sad. I miss my friend, I miss my brother.

He is in my dreams occasionally. Sometimes I dream he is still alive. The dreams seem to real and when I wake up I cry because reality sets back in. 

There is only one answer in this universe that I want to know yet I will never ever know and that is 'why did he do it?'

I love you Shawn

Summer is nearly finished, soon the leaves will change color and fall, soon school will start once again and I cannot help but think where did my childhood go?

It's funny to think how something like work can even make summer not feel like summer. I realize now that I will never have a true summer again. 

Although I will keep physically growing, nothing will ever take the child that lies inside my soul.

Well for everyone who is interested:

First off, I am great! And as mushy as this is gonna come out, it's all because of *her*. Thank you. Besides seeing her, this summer has been less than average. Sorry to all those people (Tim espicially) whom I haven't called to hang out. It is not that I don't wanna hang out with you, just work and others things have came into play.

Got back from Rehobeth Beach with Lor & her family. Simply put; amazing.

I love her... I honestly do.

Well that is all I have to say for now... when school starts I will be updating more.

Until you hear from me again my audience . . .

Parting is such sweet sorrow . .

Yours Truly,

"event","Ah, the beautiful weather is upon us, old friends reuniting once again to enjoy in the laughter and the old memories.

But I still feel a little empty inside. 

It's been five plus months since Shawn's passing and I still have yet to cope with it. It's so hard to...

I miss him greatly.

So that is why I am dedicating this summer to you Shawn. I am going to make it the best summer of my life... because Shawn I know you would have wanted me to do so. So to everyone who was lucky to know him we are going to get together often, cookout, drink some beers, have fun, enjoy each other's company.

So now onto the relationship... things could not get any better. I am so lucky. This summer is going to be a relationship tester to see how strong ""this is"". I know we will survive this. She is truly an earth angel and a unbelievable blessing in my life. We will be seeing one another as much as possible this summer... I know it won't be as much as we want but we'll get by.

Then there is my best friend(well tied with Tuna) who won't be here at all this summer. You and Tuna are more than friends to me... you two are my brothers and will always be. I cannot even describe what this summer is going to be like since I won't be seeing you like everyday like the past summers. I hope you can make a trip up here sometime... for me.

THEN Derek won't even be here this summer(so gay, yeah I said it. G. A. Y. Stupid Florida!) But oh well... hopefully he will make an appearance or two here.

Life is good... life is beautiful... life is now.

"event","The Good: Lauren and I went on a date on Friday night. Before our movie started, we went shopping for Mother's Day presents. Both of us found presents for our mothers(which I hope both like). Then we met Brea and her boyfriend John(who were late) at the movies. We went to see the new Ben Stiller & Jack Black comedy ""Envy"". The movie was good if you enjoy those two actors. I thought it would have been better but oh well I still had a great time. Spending time with her is really really good. I've never felt like ""this"" before, never had another person truly care about me like this before. 

*Golden Girls* (inside joke)

The Bad: Like all relationships, saying goodbye is never easy. I despise saying goodbye to her. That look she gets on her face breaks my heart. Sunday I hated saying goodbye to her... but I had to. 

The Ugly: After having a lovely date on Friday... returning and we get into an accident! Don't remember much of it, but I am just thankful we walked away from it because this accident could have been so much worse than it actually was. What caused us to crash was a prior accident that happened probably within a minute to our accident. I am just glad we didn't hit anyone else or possibly hurt anyone else. I thank the Lord for that. Everything happens for a reason, this happened for some reason. We survived for some reason. I am thankful for that.

Evan & Jaron put on a kick-ass performance. Their songs on their new CD are pretty good plus they did some great covers. I am glad I went... I am even more glad I didn't have to pay the $10 but if I knew the concert would have been as good as it was I would have forked over the cash.

So of course Lor already liked E&J and so I bought her the new CD ('cause that's what a good boyfriend naturally does). I liked the band that was on before E&J so much I bought their CD (Yves Jean Band-""Rise Above Your Surroundings"")

A big Happy Birthday to one of my best friends Scott Brothers; a person who challenges me only to make me become a better person. I wish I could have been there to help celebrate your big night. But Saturday you, Tuna and I will ""git r dun!"" Three Amigos reunited.... uh oh!

Well Spring Break is yet once again upon us. Still I cannot understand why all of my friends who go to different colleges have different breaks then me. Some was this past week, while others will be the week after mine. I just wanted to see some old yet familiar faces. 

Also a premature Happy 21st Birthday to a super/great friend of mine, the one, the only, the man whom your parents warned their under-age daughters about.... ""The One Night Stand"" Derek ""Delicious"" Tuttle!!!!!!! (*crowd goes wild!!!) *EDIT* Apparently I will be able to party with you when you turn Delicious & that will be absolutely delicious. But still when we get back to school ""the beer will flow like wine"" .... well perhaps not... but we will just buy some beer and get drunk. Sound good? 

Until you hear from me again my audience . . .

Parting is such sweet sorrow . .

Yours Truly,
Jon""Yada Yada Yada""Chuckery"

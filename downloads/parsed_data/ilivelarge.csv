I consider her a drug... the worst drug in that matter. Its the kind of drug that your friends and parents tell you to stay away from. But when you do try it your hurt emointionally physcailly and mentally. And right then you know why your friends and parents told you to say no the frist time. There are side eefects but most of you kno them so... there is no need to get into that. She crushed my ciggarettes the other day.... i got pissed .... My solution: i smoked all of hers. then&nbsp;me and ryan &nbsp;stole $600 and spent it in the most redicuolus ways ever just because we hate her and we deserved the money.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

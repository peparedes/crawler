"event","I had a strange dream last night.. though I don't quite remember what it was about. Something about grass and pillowcases.

How do you tell someone to shut up with sounding incredibly rude? There's a stuck up little girl at this forum I frequent. Feh. Six day weekend. Yannow.. election day and teacher conventions. Sooo.. Spent the day playing computer games. Go me! I still have to finish 200+ pages of 1964.. yet another 'classic' I find boring with characters I don't care about. That and more outlining for history.

I'm tired. Mmm.. sleepy time!"

"event","So... came out on Tuesday. Got it yesterday. Didn't get a chance to play until today. Anyway.. it's pretty. Nice graphics, Some bits seem a bit too bright compared to what I'm used to but it's not bad. I'd have to say that Hector walks kinda strangely. He seems to lift his arms too high. It seems that all recent Castlevania games have protagonists with silver hair. Mmmm..

And.. it's midnight and my homework is not yet done! Go me! Ah well.. I don't really expect to be doing much work in school tomorrow. It's one of those weird teacher training weeks or something. I have school tomorrow only... and then the rest of the week we have off. I'm not complaining. More time for me to waste. :D"

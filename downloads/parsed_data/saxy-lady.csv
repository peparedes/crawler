I found that out on Friday when I worked an 8 hour shift after I stayed up all night to finish another paper.  I'll sleep either Tuesday night, or Wednesday before work.  I went out with the guy from work, he's a nice guy.  A whole lot shier than any other guy I know.  I'm still not too sure what it is that he's looking for, or wants from me.  So, for right now, I'm assuming a regular friendship.  

hmm... for my roommate Heather I'm doing the Relay for Life in St Thomas in June.  I hate collecting sponsors, but this is a Most Excellent cause so I will do it without complaint. 

I'm already thinking that the people I'm moving in with on Saturday was a bad choice.  When I lived with the one person last year and the year before it wasn't so bad... now I'm starting to second guess my decision to live with her.  She wants rent money for February, March and April.  I haven't moved in there yet.  She knew I wasn't moving in until the end of April, but stil swears that I didn't tell her that.  I'm trying to get the information for the bank account that she opened solely for our rent as I'm typing this.  She keeps changing the subject.  She's driving me crazy.  I have to figure out how to get a bus pass too since the house she decided on is on the other side of Kitchener.  Doesn't help me with trying to save money.  I can see that this year is not going to be any better than it has been this year with the potheads here.  grrrrr

Right, well i should get my ass in gear and start on the essay thats due tomorrow so I can start on the one that's dues on Tuesday.

Love you guys
I wish you enough."

Weather looks about as good as I feel.
A guy from work said he wanted to talk to me, but he wants to go for a walk.  He's a nice guy and I've hung out with him beofre, I just don't want to walk in teh rain any more than I have to.
You'd think I'd learn by now that when I'm practically manic one day, that I'll be crazy depressed the next.
I still have too many essays to write before school is finished.  3 are now late. I didn't get them done this weekend because I just didn't care.  I even tried to keep myself awake so that I could force myself to write them, but there was always something not so tedious to do.  I hate essays, I always have.  I'm REALLY not looking forward to the 20 page paper that I'm supposed to have done on the 20th.  
Guh.  Must get out of this mood.  Must write.

Okay, so, now I'm supposed to have 20 credits, which is fine because I already have 19.5, however, I now dont need 2.5 of those, and I'm not sure the school is going to count them as part of my major.  I have to go talk to someone who actually know what the school is doing for all of us who registered for classes BEFORE September 2003.  Since I already have 19.5 credits and am technically only in need of .5 of a credit, how is it, that I have to have 1 full credit to meet the requirements.  This is the dumbest thing ever.

"event","Ok, so my quesion is aren't professors supposed to HELP you?!?!  I went in to talk to one of my profs today because, as you know I've been pretty depressed lately, and last night it got even worse. WOO!  So there is an exam scheduled for Monday, and i went in to ask him what I missed in the classes that I wasn't able to drag my ass ou of bed for.  I told him that I have been depresseda and I've been having trouble getting up, but that I'm determined to go to all of his classes for the rest of the year.  he asked me what was so TERRIBLE in my life that could POSSIBLY make me so upset.  I proceded to tell him a lot of the things that have happened.  His suggestion to lessen my stress load was to qquit school and come back when I feel better.  I fack you.  I'm droping his class.  I can pick up the half credit that this class is worth next year when I come back.  He probably doesn't realize, but that was like a kick in the ass for me.  I am now more determined to finish this stupid degree. WITH honours.  I was going to thank him for giving me that extra push.  Guess I REALLY don't like it when people tell me I can't do something.  I'm now doing this to prove to myself that I can.  Maybe I SHOULD go in and thank him for that.  Naw, I'd probably yell at himinstead.  Turns out that my patience isn't what it used to be eithe. meh!  ok.  I have to go to work now. Just remember, at schools in the south they just don't care like they do in the north.  I kinda miss it up there now."

"event","It's been almost two months sice I've used LJ.  Yet I dont think much has happened.  well...hmm...  I've started seeing someone.  Not sure how we're doing since he's really sick, and I don't have a way of getting to see him, and his mother screens his calls as well as gives us a time limit on the talking.  I guess it wears him out, but we always seem to be just getting into something intersting when she gets on the extension and tells us to get off the phone, then waits while we say goodbye and hang up.  He was getting awhole lot better, he was supposed to be off of some of the drugs by next week, the doc told him to go outside, and because he's a pretty active guy, he went on a winter hike.  I was supposed to go, but I had to work.  He hurt his hip to the point where he might be on disability for the rest of his life.  Not sure how he did it.  It just siezed up. Now it doesn't move like it should.  HE's at the doctor right now.  I get to see him next week.  I think.  As long as I have some of my work done.

I really don't sound excited, but I'm still pretty depressed.  I didn't go get antidepressants afterall.  I hate drugs.  

I'm definitely ready for this break next week.  I've decided that I hate this program, and if I was in something else I would be HAPPY to go to class.  I can't even seem to drag myself to my 11:30 am class on a regular basis. Class gets in the way of school!!! 

I'm going snowboarding next weekend for the first time.  It should be intersting.  I hope I don't break anything... though sometimes I kinda hope I will.  I'm weird.  I'm going on Friday to buy snopants cuz a couple of the guys I work with have decided that they are going to teach me how to board before I go. They say I'm going to either end up on my face, or butt a lot for the first couple runs.  Sounds like fun  :)

I got almost everything out.  He took the key to the storage locker so its still full of stuff, but there's nothing we can do about that now.  I was just happy to get out what I did.  My parents had 5 copies of their wedding pictures made into albums, and I found the last one in the apartment.  I think Bill must have tossed the rest.  At this point I don't really care because I stil have one.  I have it here with me.  I'm just not sure which box its in.  :D  I think I'm going to see if I can make 2 copies of it. one for my sis, and one for my brother...

"event","OK, since the last post, I didn't get up the next morning like i thought i would.  i didn't go to the doctor, i figure, I'm strong enough to have gone through everything else this year without the crutch of meds, and with the way i've been going lately, i'll prolly end up addicted, so the plan is to tough it out.  if another 6 months pass and i still feel like this, then i'll go do something about it.  

My hands are reacting so much to the cleaning supplies at work they're trying to have me stop working on the hot deli(cooking and playing with grease), and go back to the cold deli (slicing meat for grumpy people).  I'm not sure that they realized that we clean over there too.... they're brilliant people.  I wrote my stats exam which I was worried about, but I figured that as long as I got 25% I'd be ok.  I'm pretty sure I made it.  

I went to my friend's work xmas party with him.  That was fun.  That was the most i've had to drink in about a year... a whole bottle of wine to myself.  And surprisingly enough i wasn't too drunk, and when i got up at 7 the next morning I felt great.  I ran into a couple guys I used to sing with in a choir when we were younger, so I knew a couple people there.  We had a great time.  the music played through dinner was kareoke and it was pretty funny to see the people go up to sing.  Some were really good (the choir boys), and others REALLY needed to pick a key.  

Yesterday i went to a Buddhist Temple for my soc of religion class.  we had to pick a religion that we didn't belong to, and attend a service. it was really interesting.  the service was done in Lao, but they were nice enough to stop at each point in their ceremony to translate into english what was going on, and why they did it.  We were there for 3 hours.  Each family cooks before the service, and the food is shared among the people who attend.  They knew we were coming, and made enough for the 6 of us who showed up.  Unfonrtunaely, it turns out i'm allergic to something they made, and i had hives all night, but it was SO good!!  I'd have to say, it was worth the itchyness to hae been able to participate in their cermeony, and to have been welcomed.  Although i shouldn't have been surprised since in their teachings, everyone and everything are the same.  

Today is my friend's birthday, its also the birthday of my friend who died last year.  I miss him, but it still doesn't seem real to me that he's gone.  it hits me when i'm in Stratford, just how many people I've lost in the past year, just not while I'm here.  They are both 22 today.  I should ccall her.  i wonder what city she's in....hmm...

Tomorrow is the early release of Lord Of The Rings.  The cinema's are playing all three movies back to back.  thats 11.5 hours of film.  I hope my butt doesn't get too numb!  I'm gonna go in my pjs, with a blanket, and prolly a little pillow so my neck doesn't hurt too much.  lol  I'm gonna feel like its camping!  

On Saturday, one of my friends is getting married, but i was also invited to a friend's early family xmas. i think the wedding wil be done before the christmas, so i should be able to make it.  

I can't believe its 10 days til christmas.  Good thing no one expects presents this year.  Cuz they aren't gonna get them.

I have to go get ready for work now.  woo fun

However, I finally got to sleep at 4 this morning, woke up at 6 to call my friend to make sure he was up for work since he asked me to last night after we went out for a drink.  At 8 I woke up after having a pretty strange dream.  

I was in my grandmother's basement with my sister and I was doing my school work.  Suddenly one of my aunts was there, and I was at a side door to a house I've never been in.  From that side door I could see bombs flying overhead.  I knew they were from another country that we OBVIOUSLY weren't getting along with.  The majority of the bombs were nuclear warheads, but there were some misiles mixed in with them.  From the house we could see that our only defence from these bombs hitting us was if we shot them out of the sky from the base that was behind the house.  A couple of the nukes were blown up in the sky, and when we inhaled our lungs were burning.  It actually hurt to breathe in my sleep.  I walked through the house checking on everyone.  My sister and I hung out in the kitchen for a bit, my mom came in, said she loved us, then walked outside and I didn't see her again.  My grandmother walked in smiled, and walked into another part of the house from which she never returned.  I saw my grandfather briefly beside a wall, but when I looked for him he wasn't there.  My aunts husband was flown in from BC even though they weren't allowing planes to fly.  He joined us in the house.  My uncle, my sister and I all stood at the front door of the house watching bombs fly over our house, and we could see out a side window when the bombs were hit from the ground.  I could hear one bomb coming from miles away.  It looked bigger than the others when it finally came into view.  I looked at everyone who was there and told them I loved them.  I grabbed my sister and my uncle, looked at them told them this was the last bomb we would see because we weren't going to make it.  All I could hear then was everyone screaming that we weren't going to make it.  I looked out another side window and watched the bomb hit the ground.  I watched the mushroom cloud grow bigger, hugged my sister and said it won't hurt as much if you breathe it in fast.  As if you have to breathe a gas in to kill you when a nuke hits?! I breathed before her and I felt a burning in my lungs, then my body went really heavy and I collapsed in her arms then I felt her breathe.  I woke up at that point.  I think its a little weird that I actually remember this dream.  its the first one in a while that I remembered.  strange.. I'm gonna go see if I can find a way to analyze it."

"event","Ok.  I thought that good news about my mom's estate would keep me going for a while, but I guess I was wrong.  I guess it was too good to last.  I went to work for 9 am. Because a new person opened yesterday SO much stuff wasn't done for me when I got there because the people who came in to close last night were trying to catch up on what she didn't get done through the day.  Once you're one day behind there, you throw everyone off for a few days.  I finished work, turned my phone on and I received a message from my father.  The only time I get phone calls from my dad are when something is wrong with the family.  That, and the depressed tone to his voice kinda gave it away. Long story short, my grandfather had lung cancer, he went in for surgery on Friday, they found that he has Fibrosis as well, so now he's in ICU in Stratford hooked up to machines to keep him going.  We don't know how long he has, he may have a few days, or it may be another.... 10 years.  I'm tired of this.  I want good things to happen.  and so I'm going to sleep...normally not so bad things happen in my dreams... even if I do dream of working.

Work was crazy.  not much really happened there, but I was working lots and lots. I went and saw my greataunt.  she's forgetting a lot more than the last time i saw her, but she's not nursing home-bound just yet so thas good.

October: wrote 2 assignments and an exam within the first 2 weeks.  on the exam i got a 94, and i got perfect on the two assignments.  I figured this year i'd do SO much better in. I did a presentation the week after that, turns out that we weren't marked on it.  Wrote a proposal for a study that was approved by the ethics committee so I just have to do that with my group.  My family did thanksgiving.  that was pretty weird because the boys all had hockey, and my one cousin skipped out dinner because he hates the family gatherings where we all end up fighting, can't say that I blame him. My brother also brought a girl along.  She's creeeeepy. and since i'm such an evil sister, i told him as much.  I don't think it would have been so bad if he'd told SOMEone, ANYone that he was bringing her along. I'm not sure what christmas is going to be like with my grandmother and my mother missing.  I know I've been invited to 7 more christmas celebrations because she's not around any more.  

Had my 22nd birthday, which everyone in my family, except my sister, forgot.  man did i feel special.  Now I can't even remember if any of my friends remembered it.  I know my roommates did because when i came home from work that night they had baked me a cake. My manager put me in charge for one day, and we got in trouble for being, and I quote, ""too happy"".  I didn't think that was possible, but I guess one of the managers in the store said that we were having too good a time while we were working.  Shealso yelled at the other girls who were there because they ""weren't listening to me""  they freaked out on me, but I didn't say that so I don't know whwere that came from.  meh
A couple weeks later I went to my friend Poco's place for a halloween party.  that was fun :P  we sat around and talked to only the people we knew, and ignored everyone else.
I finally got a hold of my one friend whose bf doesn't really want her talking to me.  she wants me to come to london for a week in december too.  I was just talking to my step brother last night though and he said that she's moving then.. so I'm not too sure if she was going to try to tell me, of if she hoped that he would tell me.. or if she's waiting for me to call her so that she can tell me.  I'm just tired of being the only one trying to keep in touch. 

Novemeber: it seems that this month, even though we're only 14 days into it has already been more eventful than the last few months put together.  I've done 2 assignments, had an exam postponed, and failed it today.  GO ME!  wrote a test in another class and that has been the start of my month from hell.  On the 8th I was working, and my manager went out for a coffee break and told me to keep an eye on things.  not 2 minutes later on of the kids came over to meand said some one had slipped oon our floor.  that didn't really fase me until i saw a guy lying on the floor convulsing.  the people he was with didn't seem upset at all, but they did try to move him.  I kinda yelled a little at them to not move his head.  I called the manager over, and i think that people could hear the panic in my voice because i had almost every manager in the store come over (which never happens.. EVER) normally it takes them 5 minutes to get there.. not that day...it was about 30 seconds by the time we'd called 911 and got him in the ambulance it had been an hour.  I was amazed people kept shopping around him as if he wasn't even there. Sunday i was in charge again, but my manager came in anyway just to make sure everything was ok.  It turns out that when our gloves that we use for the ovens get cracked and fill with grease/oil from our fryer and chickens that when it ferments I'm allergic to something in it.  I told my manager that I'd have to quit, and that I was already looking for another job.  she said that she couldn't afford to lose me and she'd do anything to prevent me from leaving.  so I'm still stuck at this stupid job, but the reaction that I was having to the gloves is going away now that we have new gloves.  She even ordered new soap in case thats what it was that was bothering my hands.  
hmm....I have a computer of my own now.  I bought it from one of my friends for $600.  
i'm going to try to write more so taht I don't have to bore you with psycho long entries like this again.  

Manda, if I don't get on here before, and I don't get a chance to talk to you.  I hope you have a great birthday.  I know I'm 2 weeks early.  so sue me."

Class is alright.  It's a good thing that I understnad people with accents pretty well because i'm having to repeat almost everything my profs are saying to the people around me.  2 of my profs are from Hong Kong and their accents are strong, but neither is as strong as my theory prof's.  She's from Russia and she's ALMOST mastered the english language.  sometimes she still doesn't know the english word that she's looking for, but at least i know whe'll use basic english which will hopefully make things a little easier.  (I hope)  
 
Work's still crazy.  but now I'm the health and safety inspector kid for the deli.  
 
The wedding was beatiful.  I didn't cry until my friend Erin sang during the signing of th registry.  We had to send a someone home because she took full advantage of the open bar.  the guy who brought her SO wasn't impressed.  meh.  I found out another one of my friends is   moving to Kitchener and he only knows 2 of us here so it looks like he'll be hanging out here a bit.

We were supposed to leave at 9 am.  That turned into 11:27, but whatever.  We had a great time at the zoo.  We left the zoo around 3 so that we'd make it back for 5.  The traffic was going pretty well until we hit a construction spot around Mississauga where the tractor trailer in front of us locked his brakes.  The driver of the car i was in slammed on his too but we still skidded the length of 2 cars and slammed into the backend of the trailer.  Because its me, I slammed my knee into the drivers seat in front of mee which made me the only person in the car to get hurt.  GO ME!  I'm ok.  and the only dammage to the car was the loss of the license plate, and a few paint chips off the hood.  YEA for '89 Tempos is all i have to say.  now I have to go get ready for work.  

I wish you enough."

"event","Since practically everyone I know is talking about the blackout that happened I thought I'd join in and give my version.  We noticed that the set of lights we go through to get to my sobeys were off, but that didn't really faze me until I got to the store where I was grabbed by a manger and told to hurry, get ready, and go help get everything out of the deli and into the freezers and coolers in the back of the store.  I was a little confused but i went.  as soon as I was in the store my manager told me to get dressed and help out the cashiers since we still had cstomers in the store who were complaining that we had no power.  SO many people were buying perishable food!  A bunch of us ran around the store finding prices for people so that we could get them out of the store quickly.  Once everyone was out of the store we went and cleaned out all of the dleli shelves, then the case where we keep all of the hot food.  We threw out SO much food.  The guys who were there in the morning had just finished filling the case for dinner when the power went out.  The store manager let us eat anything that was going to go into the garbage. Actually, that day we had a few of the people who're pretty high up in the Sobeys chin at the store checking us out to see how we work.  (Turns out it was a good thing that they were there.  Our store is viewed as a very well organised group of people...shows how little they know....  :)  We ended up scewering chickens by the light from 3 flashlights.  At 8:30 we had to receive a delivery of produce by flashlight too.  lets just say, that loose potatoes, cucumbers, and green peppers are a horrible thing to try to see on the floor when you've only got 2 flashlights between 6 people. We finally lit  a few candles at 9.  The whole time we were cleaning out the store we had peopole coming to the doors asking why we weren't open.  GEE...I wonder...

and that was my experience in the Blackout of 2003  :)

On another note.  I went to a second wedding this month yesterday.  Before i could leave my mangaer asked me to come in yesterday morning so i worked 7-11, got a ride to the bus station from my manager.  I got to the bus station just in time to buy my ticket. I got to stratford in just enough time to drop my stuff at my aunt ans uncles place, let them know i was staying at their place for the night and that i would need a ride back to th eLoo.  Good thing they don't mind doing that.  The wedding was great.  My date (the sexiest man alive for Tim) didn't show up.  I hope he's okay.  I made it back here for work this morning.  i worked from 9-5, came home rearranged my room, and ate.  Now I write.  The end!

"event","I was reading a story in the newspaper today while I was at work, and it was talking about the use of the word marriage when referring to the union of a same-sex couple.  For some reason, our government seems to think that by using ""civil union"" instead of ""marriage"" they will get more positive feedback from the Canadian population than they have had so far.  I seriously think that if the only problem that people had was with a single word they would have said as much, and not protested the entire idea of same-sex marriages.  I personally support the union of same-sex couples.  Maybe its because I have more gay/lesbian/bisexual friends than I've ever had.  Or maybe its because I know that no matter what sex, age, race, religion etc. people are, they still feel, and have the same needs.  needs that can truly only be filled by another human being.  Who do these people think they are to tell others that they cannot have a simple piece of paper with their names on it.  Honestly, I think its just another way people show that they trust their partner.  What did people do when we didn't have marriage?  Does that mean that all of the people who were around before the concept of marriage was thought of went to hell because a spiritual leader did not pronounce them husband and wife?  Speaking of spiritaul leaders, where do the leaders get off telling people who have same-sex relationships that they are going to Hell, when they themselves are abusing the young males in their following?  

BAH!  thas my rant, thanks for reading.  I don't know, I guess it's been bothering me since people started saying that the union between two people of the same sex cannot be called a marriage.  For all intents and purposes IT IS!!!!!

"event","I promised that I would let you know about my trip when I got back, and since I'm back I figured I should keep my promise.  Actually I've been back for a couple days now, but I've been really lazy, and everytime I try to write in here people call, come over, or msn me and I don't want to be rude so I sit and talk.  

OK, I start now.

Let's see, I went home to Stratford on Monday, July 27th after work for the night because my dad wanted to see me.  He seemed to think that my sister and I weren't coming back from B.C. so he should prolly see us before we left.  We left the next morning for T.O. by bus.  To get to T.O. we have to make a connection in Kitchener.  We've both made this trip several times, at least to Kitchener, however, our bus driver for the day had never been on the route before, an I was starting to wonder if he had driven a bus before.  The way he was changing gears made me think that the transmission was about to fall out of the bus, and we'd have to walk to Kitchener.  He also didn't know what streets to take to get to Kitchener.  He had all of the directions written out, and instead of reading them over himself, and checking as we went, he handed the paper to two elderly women in the front of the bus to tell him where we were supposed to go.  (He had done the same thing from London to Stratford, and was 1/2 hour late because he had made a left turn instead of a right because one had told hime to go right, and the other left)  That would have been fine if they had ever been on the bus before, but since they hadn't they were telling him directions WAY too far in advance.  (For Tim, they were giving him instructions 10 minutes outside of New Hamburg for the streets in the town)  We made it into Kitchener, late but in one piece.    We were glad to see that the driver of the bus changed, especially since we had to go downtown Toronto, and REALLY didn't want to be lost.  My sister and I spent the rest of the day trying to find me a pair of shoes, and her an outfit for the wedding.  We finally succeeded in our mission by 9pm.  We went back to her place, figured out how to get to the airport for my flight and went to sleep.  We left her place at 8am, figuring it would take an hour to get the sirport, leaving me with 2 hours to sit in the airport before my flight.  We took the subway to York Mills where the GO bus is supposed to be running from.  Turns out, that because of the SARS concert they weren't running from there that day, and we'd have to go to York Dale instead.  We figure it out, and that still leaves me with an hour and a half at the airport if we catch the next bus to York Dale.  The next bus is full of people trying to get there so we wait for the next bus.  By the time we catch the bus, that leaves me with and hour at the airport, still enough time to go through everything and still wait for my plane.  We get to York Dale at 9am, the next bus leaves platform 9 at 9:20.  No problem, we can have our breakfast of cinnamon buns upstairs in the mall for a few minutes before catching the bus.  We get down to the bus station at 9:15 and see a bus pull out of platform 8.  Platform 8 blocks part of platform 9 to we figure our bus should pull in right behind it.  When no other bus pulls into the station and stops in a platform anywhere near #9 we went in and asked where the bus was.  The guy in the window looks at us like we were  REALLY stupid and told us that it was the last bus to leave in the area that we were standing in.  Turns out the bus had left from platform 8 because the driver couldn't pull the bus into platform 9, and he left 5 minutes early.  Nice of him I thought.  The next bus doesn't come for an hour, so we finish our cinnamon buns and I called the airport to find out if they think I can make it through the airport in the 15 minutes that I'm now going to have before my plane takes off.  Turns out I can take any flight out because of the way my uncle set up the ticket for me.  My choices were a flight out at 12, or one at 1:30.  We get on the bus (on platform 8!!!!!!) and get to the airport at 10:45.  I found someone who works in the airport, and asked him what line I was supposed to be in because there were 3 in sight, and more father down the terminal.  He told me to get into the closest line up (waiting time 1hr).  He said I could still make the 12pm flight if I run through security and down through the gates.  so i stand in line and I wait... I watched the clock the whole time I was in line.  At 11:30 I went to a shorter line that was rushing people through for 11:55 flights.  I thought that I should probably go over ans stand at the end of the line and go through too.  The guy I had talked to earlier came over and asked me what flight I was supposed to be on so i explained that I had missed my 11:00 flight, and was trying to get on the 12:00 flight to Vancouver he laughed and told me I was in the wrong line and to wait becuase he hadn't pulled the people out of the first line I was in for that flight yet and to go back.  At 12:20 he stood at the front of the line and asked if there was anyone in the line trying to get to Vancouver.  I said I was, and AGAIN I had to tell him that i had missed the 11:00 flight, the 12:00 flight and I had a connection to make at 4:00 in Van.  He got all pissed off and told me that I was on the wrong side of the terminal and I should have been down at the far end.  IT WAS THE SAME FREAKING GUY EVERYTIME!  He tried to talk me into taking the flight out at 4 that would get me to Victoria at 10pm.  I REALLY wasn't up for it and asked if he could get me on the 1:30 flight.  After another 10 minutes of trying to get me to take the 4 pm flight he said he could TRY to get me on the 1:30 flight if I really wanted to make my connection, however, because that plane wasn't supposed to land until 3:30 he could not gauruntee that I would make my connection, in fact it was an ""illegal connection"" so he wouldn't give me a boarding pass for my connection and I had to check in at the desk when I got there.  I got on the plane, made it into Vancouver 18 minutes early, and went to the desk.  I told the lady what had happened and she told me to have a seat because it was alright that I didn't have a boarding pass.  They started boarding the plane and I went back to the same lady and told her what happened again.  She asked me what flight i was supposed to be on and I told her the one that they were boarding as we were talking.  She freaked out because hse had just given my seat away to someone else because I supposedly hadn't checked in when my flight arrived. I finally got on the plane since one of the people who had a seat didn't show up.  It was litteraly the last seat on the plane.  On the plane there are 19 rows of seats with 2 on each sidee of the plane and the last row has 5 across.  I got the middle seat in the last row so I felt like i was sitting in the aisle.  ANYWAY I made it to Victoria in one piece.  My sister's day went smoothly when she flew out the next day.  We didn't do much for the first couple days.  We were pretty tired from the days of travelling with few hours of sleep in between.  On the Saturday we went to my cousin's wedding.  On the way there I was talking to my aunt about what she wasnted out of my mother's apartment, and my uncle was sensitive enough to tell me that they were just things, it had been 3 months since I had been there, I was never going to see any of my things again and to get over it.  My aunt, my mother's little sister, agree with him and they both decided that I had been upset over my mother's death for too long as it was, and I should get over it.  I didn't ta t ihrothe for the restothe a. mysister and I were restraining ourselves from yelling at them, and hitting them, but we figured that we still had a week n a hafta whdt ty ith them nd it would prolly be a good idea to remain calm.  The next day there was a pig roast, and since we haven't seen out cousins in 3 years we really wanted to hang out with them for a little bit.  My aunt and uncle wanted to go home and not hang out with the family.  Because they were out ride, and we refused to go until we had at least said goodbye to them, my uncle got upset, especially with me since it was my idea in the first ple.  My aunt told me to go appologize to him because I had hurt his feelings.  I was a little pissed off and I told her I wouldn't.  Needless to say the rest of the trip was a little strained.  Because I was not allowed to go out by myself I spent most of my time sleeping inmy room, and reading books.  I made it through the new Harry Potter in 3 days I had so much time to read.  I left there on Sunday morning at 8 am (11am here) and got to my house around 8pm.  

I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the sunshine that I had out there and I did not miss SW Ontario's humidity one bit.  I just wish that it was sunny here now. 

I wish you enough.  and thanks for reading my boring account of my trip.

Tomorrow morning I'll go to Toronto with my sister to stay at her place so I don't have quite so far to go to the airport.  I'm still not all that excited.  I mean I AM, just not as excited as I normally get when I go places.  Maybe its because I know that I can't tell my brother that I'm going.  Or maybe its because the last time I went out there my grandmother, and my mom went too.  I dunno.  Anyway, I should make sure that I have everything I'll need for a couple weeks before I have to get on the bus.  Take care, and I'll talk to you in 2 weeks.

"event","WARNING:  this rant is kinda boring.  I'm not even sure why I posted it.

within the last 24 hours i have been told that i have a great ass 5 times.  i feel special. too bad one was from a 16 year old kid, one from a guy I know here who has a gf ... and who's also kinda dirty, and the other 3 were from perfectly single guys who i'm not interested in.  Good for me.  Is there something wrong with me that I don't really care that guys like my body.  I don't see what the big deal is.  We all have a body.  its not like mine's all that different from any other female in the world.  I don't understand people.  I've given up trying to pretend that I do understand them too.

NEXT:  my housemates are driving me crazy with all of the fighting thats been going on  in the past couple weeks.  3 of the girls went to Bayfest in Sarnia this past weekend.  They decided to go just before i moved in to the house, I didn't really care that i wasn't invited... it was yet another thing that I couldn't afford to do this summer anyway.  You'd think that since they've known about this of about 2 months they would have figured out how they were getting there, how they were getting back, and how much stuff they could take with them based on that information.  One fo the girls who lives near London had a wedding in the family that she was supposed to go to on the same day as some of the concerts. And she had to work at her job at home, and would be back here for another 4 days after the concert. Turns out that since she's the only one with a functioning vehicle now that she's the one driving. If i were going, that would mean to me that I either have to find my own way back here, or stay at her parents place(which WAS an option).  INSTEAD, the other two girls wait until they are at the campsite before they realize that the driver won't be there at the end of the concert and start to freak on her for not letting them know that she won't be there.  I wasn't even GOING and i knew that she wouldn't be around for half of the last day. Instead of staying at the girl's parents place they decided to come back here.  I'm not exactly sure what happened at the campsite on the night that they were all together, but with the way they're all carrying on it doesn't seem good.  They all expect me to choose sides in this fight.  I think that I've pissed them off because i said that I think they are all wrong in this situation, some more than others.  

It even carried over to tonight when 2 of us hadn't eaten much all day and ordered 2 pizzas.  one of the girls was upset because she wanted to have pizza too but we didn't order a vegan one.  THAT was my fault because i figured that since she had eaten a veggie dog like 30 minutes earlier, that she wouldn't want any.

TOO MUCH ESTROGEN IN ONE BUILDING!!!!!!!!!!

Anyway.  enough of my boring rant.  i need to go to sleep so i can work for 2 hours tomorrow morning.

"event","Honestly, how difficult is it to wait patiently for 10 seconds while an emploee finsihes the job they are doing before you tell them that you want something.  6 people today, SIX, just walked over to me and told me what they wanted...Half the time I wasn't even at the counter before they demanded their food.  I hate when that happens because they ALWAYS get angry with you if you didn't quite hear what it was that they said.  It ends up taking more time than it would have if they had just waited for a few seconds for me to get them. 

THEN there's the people who interrupt you when you're CLEARLY serving someone else to tell you what they want. Lately, there's only been one of us on the counter at any given time.  If this is the case, WAIT YOU TURN!!!!  How hard is it?!  REALLY!!!!!  thank goodness I don't have to deal with people for the next 2 days unless I want to.  my temper is coming back full force again.  I need a punching bag.

On the upside, because I worked in another city for a couple of days I was paid to get myself there....it only took a month, but I got my check.  Good thing too, I only had $1.83 in my bank account, and about $3 in pennies here. 

I'm heading to the bank to cash it.  I might write a little later.

I got a call from my friend Susan at 9:15 his morning asking me to go to the market with her this morning so I went because I was already up by that point.  I then came home and sat with my housemate's sister, and two friends of hers because she decided to go visit another one of her friends for 4 hours without telling anyone that she was going.  While I was doing that I got nicely burnt by the sun.  I then went to a BBQ with the girls where I didn't know anyone, but I met a couple nice people, too bad they dont hang out at our house.  The whole time we were there, the girls I came with were smoking pot so I didn't really want to talk to them a whole lot, so, yet again, I hung out with the guys and played Frizbee ... til I got hit in the boob.  :)  Stupid shelf getting in the way YET again. then we went to go see the fireworks at Columbia lake in Waterloo.  That would have been kool if I hadn't spent the whole time the display was on walking to the field because the rest of the people we went with forgot about one of our housemates.  I was nice enough to ge her from our house, a half hour walk, and take her to the place we were watching from, half hour back.  now I'm tired and this is a whooole lot longer than I thought it was going to be.

"event","Today, I broke a slicer.  Normally this is a VERY difficult thing to do.  Today, not so much hard.  I was cleaning it beacuse we were closing.  I lifted the slicer up on to its stand so I could clean underneath it.  I pushed a little too hard on it since it was stuck to the table and I pushed the little stand off the edge of the table.  I tried catching it but it weighs like 400 lbs so that didn't work out that well.  It hit the ground and my foot and broke into 5 pieces.  GO ME!!!  Two of us put it back on the table and I picked up the other pieces, one of which hit me in the face because it was a freely moving part.  I told the store manager and he laughed at me and told me to write my manager a note.  I also have to call her at home tomorrow to let her know what happened.

I found out a couple nights ago, that one of my friends didn't know that the girl he dated a couple months ago is going out with another guy now. I told him.  He's not too happy, but he'll deal I hope.  i feel bad for being the one to tell him, but they had spoken  couple days before I talked to him so I assumed that she told him.  I assumed wrong.  

One more complaint and I'm outta here.  I really wish that I had a friend who I was close with, who was close to me geographically.  I miss having someone around like I have for the past 2 summers.  2 years ago I had my friend Melissa, who is getting married in about a year and a half.  And last year I had my friend Shannon, but she lives with her abusive boyfriend now so I'm not allowed to see her anymore according to him.  :P  Sure I have my housemates now, but its not the same.

Ok, I'm done.  I wish you enough."

"event","I'm finally home.  Its weird how m place in Waterloo feels more like home now than any where else I've lived in the past 2 years.  Woodstock wasn't very exciting.  But, I DID have fun with my friends Jacki and Jeff.  the deli there is, like, half the size of the one in my store.  It was nice having a break from the people that I work with here.  Only 2 more weeks of the one girl that I can't stand, and my manager isn't scheduling me with the other girl I don't like.  YEA!!  Ummm....I dont really have anything else in my head....maybe later.  Until then, I wish you enough."

"event","I'm excited. NOT!!!!!!! Instead of staying at Tim's place and seeing him in Guelph this weekend, as well as getting to see one of the new people I met here play with his band, I have to go work in Woodstock because their store is under staffed, and my store has enough people working to fill 2 stores.  Glad that I know people who live there now.  Glad I met up with them again this past weekend!!  Glad they like me enough to let me stay with them for a few days.  
I got to go to my friends' buck and doe this past weekend.  Hurt to see her with her mom but I guess thats to be expected right now.  It'll get better. We had a lot of fun though.  I haven't seen her much in the past 3 years. After seeing her almost everyday starting at 7:15 am at school for 5 years it's been weird not seeing her until now.  I'll get to see her a little more often now with all of the parties that will be thrown for her so that'll be nice.  Jacki is one of the few that I really do miss seeing that I hung out with in high school.  Some fo them i could still do without.  Thats not nice I know....but thats how I feel right now so :P
Only 37 more days til I go to BC for my cousin's wedding.  I'm VERY excited that good things are now happening in my family.  Its about time!!  AND my friend is getting married 5 days after I get back from there. YEAYE!!  Anyway.....now I think thats really all my news. No new developments in the whole thing with my mother so at the pace that things are going now, we should be able to get everything finalized next year.  How exciting I know....but then it'll be done so thats a good thing.  I'm trying to think positively if you were wondering...I think I'm getting better at this!  GO ME!!!  and on that I should head out.  It's too hot in here...I'm heading out to the livingroom where everyone else is watching wrestling.....I'm suddenly reminded of Brad slamming people off the couches, and picnic tables in first year.  *shakes head*ok...I'm done now"

"event","well, lets see.  I've decided that my life could get worse. My brother has now decided that life is no longer worth living, the people he's been staying with want him to move out but he doesn't have the money to do so.  We still haven't burried my mother, and by sounds of things we aren't going to any time soon because its all up to her jackass.  He has to get a lawyer and apply through the courts to be in caharge of her estate but he doesn't have the money to do that.  If he does get a lawyer and the money from my mother's estate, he owes the government 7 years of taxes that he never filed so on top of really not getting anything from my mom's investments he's going to owe a whole WHACK of cash.  I think he knows this and thats why he's not doing anything.  he's such a shythead!!  as you can tell I'm stil very angry about everything.  
NEXT: I'm back working at Sobeys as you know. I like how they schedule me for 14 hours but call me in so that I end up working 30.  I like the cash, but really.  if you wanted me to work why not just schedule me in?! I've also decided that we need to get rid of a couple of the girls who work there.  
1. Sebrina - we're allowed 15 minute breaks that we get paid for.  The number of breaks corresponds with the length of the shift.  Last night her bf showed up and instead of 15 minutes, she took 30.  Normally it wouldn't have been a problem, but it was Sunday night and EVERYONE comes on Sunday night.  I had to get ppl from another part of the department to help me out so that I wouldn't have 6+ ppl standing at my counter at any given time.  
2. Lilla - Thinks that because she's been there for 2 years she knows everything.  She gets upset if anyone tries to help do something, but if you don't offer to help she gets upset too.  She also doesn't like people so its difficult to get her to serve anyone.  Kinda defeats the purpose of working in a grocery store in a department that requires helping people if you ask me.  but what do i know?!  Glad she's going to George Brown in August.  Dont know how much longer i can deal with people.

I give up.  i have to go get ready for work now.  my rant is finished.  I wish you enough"

"event","Well boys and girls, I know I haven't told you much of what's been going on in my life, but this is one of the first times that I've actually been able to post, and I think that I've only got a couple minutes to do it in.  
You know that I went home to take care of my mother about 3 weeks ago, if you've read Tim's post you  know that she died on May 12th.  At least we got to spend Mother's Day with her, even if she wasn't able to communicate with us.  
Wednesday we had the visitation, almost all of the people in my family wanted to hit the guy that my mother has been seeing for 22 years because he showed up but we thought twice about it and so we didn't hit him.  On Thursday we had the funeral, I'm not sure what the guy said to my father, but my dad almost tried to kill him until his heart started bothering him again.  Friday morning my uncle got a call telling him to ""Get those kids and their SH*T out of MY apartment"".  The jackass had signed the lease along with my mother and so my brother, sister, and I were kicked out to live with our family and friends.  I still have my place in Waterloo, and my sister has a place in Toronto so it wasn't so bad for us, but my brother has been living with my mom for ...well...forever, so he's being bounced around between his friends because my family doen't want to help him out now that he's 28.  (Tim, please don't let him know that)  Right now he needs all the support he can get!!  I quit my job as the hotdog girl, and am now back at my shytacular job as a deli chick in Sobeys.  My sister got her job back, minus $2/hour since the school can no longer afford to pay her the salary she was getting before she left.  My brother is working in a store called ""Amazing Clayworks""  where he gets to mix dye for clay, and he gets to learn how to make things with clay.  It should be good for him.  He seems to like it so far.
As for the jackass who is living in my mother's apartment, it turns out that they were married in 1996, didn't tell anyone, and this is now making our lives hell.  We haven't even buried her yet!  My life seems to be going downhill!  I hope it will get better.  I don't think that my body can take anymore stress.  I'm sure it could, I'd just rather not have to.  I have other things on my mind I just can't think of them all right now.  That sounded weird.  meh.  I have to sleep now.  Sleep makes the bad things go away...until I dream...that gives me 90-120 minutes of peaceful sleep.  works for me!!

Stay safe.  And I wish you all enough."

"event","I forgot.  if you giys could visit thebreastcancersite.com and click on a pink button that says PROVIDE MAMMOGRAM a company will pay for a mammogram for a woman who cannot afford to pay for it. You can go everyday.  Yesterday, only three mammograms were donated.  I think that number sucks so if you guys could do me a favour....even if it is just once.  could you go there, and tell people about it too.

I wrote this I guess because since my mom has cancer now the chances of the rest of the females in my family being diagnosed just increased.  I kinda like my family and would like to keep them around for a bit.  And i figure that going to a site and clicking on a button doesn't take too much time out of your day... and its free!!  ok.  I'll stop with the ranting about this now.  ciao"

If you could have ANY job ANYWHERE in the world at ANY point in time, what would it be, and when would it be?  (Money is not an issue)

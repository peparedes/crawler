"event","This is the first weekend I've been alive enough to sit down and do a post.  Between jet-lag, work, desperately trying to get the flat presentable for a family visit and making a start on Christmas shopping I've been face down dead up until now.  On the plus side now my memories of the awesome +5, double-plus-good time I had at Frostmorn's place have been keeping me flying for the rest of the time. :D
  I had an awesome time in Seattle.  We saw tourist stuff, we saw epic bookage, we ate soap!  Much relaxing was had, much ferret time was enjoyed.  I also got to meet the rest of her family for the first time.  We had both sat down and talked with her mother at university, but it was my first time meeting her father and sister.  And fishing for her cats.
  As for right now, I haven't cleaned my flat since I got back and still need to put my suitcases away. :S  I'm planning on doing a big blitz tomorrow as I had to run out and shop today.  Beyond that work continues as usual.  I'm currently in second place in the 40k tournament, and running a Call of Cthulhu campaign which seems to be going well.  One player has praised the spooky atmosphere, despite the fact that everyone was laughing like hyenas for about 90% of the time.
  Also, if anyone cares to trawl back through my old entries you might remember my review of a zombie book set on a ship in the Napoleonic era.  Well, they finally put out 2 more of the series.  The second is so dreary that I've stopped reading it about half way through.  The thisrd I picked up today.  Apparently the plot of that one is the english civil war...but Cromwell sold his soul to the devil to get an invincible zombie army.  Nice.
  Hopefully I'll try and get into movie-review mode and put something up soon.  That or discuss the 5th edition in action and my current plans for my guard.  In the meantime have fun all!"

"event","One of the new features of 5th edition is that firing through your own men gives your enemies a cover save.  This is combined with the rule that says that only troops count for capturing objectives has kind of thrown up a few good and bad things.

What happened before - 

A lot of 'elite' armies would take 2 troop choices, then load up on expensive, tasty elites, heavy and fast attack, depending on how the army played.  Most troop-heavy armies would do this too, with most guard forces that I saw being 2 2-squad platoons and a ton of tanks.  Personaly I played guard in big blocks.  I also used to rank them up in rows 2-squads deep in order to maximise firepower and force target priority checks if anyone wanted to target my command or heavy squads.

Why it makes me a sad panda - 

My army will lose focus for the time being.  When the new codex comes out maybe I'll be able to shoot through my own men.  Maybe I'll be able to buy some upgrades to my units to make them worh the way they work with the current doctrines.  Maybe they won't be screwed right in the eye.  Waiting to find out is going to be a liller.  In the meantime my army has to spread it's self very, very thin in order to not give my enemies a cover save.  Against marines I HAVE to kill them outright by negating any chance to save.  I HAVE to do this.  So in order to do so I have to deploy heavy weapons platoons right next to the squads that should be shielding them from assaults and enemy firepower.
And one of the lessons I leanred was that guard have to bunch up and focus firepower, given how light and piddly it is otherwise.

Why I am now a happy kitty - 

2 out of the 3 mission objectives require you to park a troops choice on an objective, and I can buy troops choices in blocks of 5.  This means that in some cases I can try and just brute-force the mission by walking wave after wave of guardsmen into the grinder and try and keep one squad alive behind the others.  This is a proposition made easier by shielding them with other squads and going to ground.
Even better, barrage weapons ignore the 'shooting through troops save' rule.  So all I have to do is pay about 10 points any my Medusa siege gun is able to shell marines as well as it did before, with the vunerable crew getting a cover save.  My heavy mortar blocks have also increased in value as they can be parked behind people to give them a cover save and still ignore cover saves for shooting through my own men.

What made me gloat more -

Aside from the above?  I worked out that I can still deploy how I used too.  All I have to do is deploy one platoon with a direct-fire heavy weapon and a direct-fire special weapon.  Behind this I deploy a platoon with a mortar and maybe no special weapon at all.  I might even, depending on the mission and enemy, skip having that as a platoon and have it as a heavy weapons squad.  This keeps up a good rate of firepower, with a lack of cover saves.
Even better than that, my obsession with walking troops into the grinder meant that I can currently field 2 platoons of 5 squads.  Since a lot of people took troops-light forces I can sit back and use my current collection without too much modification.  Aside from the mortars I am currently painting, of course. :P"

Beyond that little has changed from my last post.  Work continues, although now i am runnign a Paranoia group through hoops and laughing at thier feeble, crushed dreams.  So far we have had 2 erasures and one bot go atomic.  That and a guy who's first action on discovering that there were no camreas in the area was to flick the team leader the v's and tell him to screw off, despite the team leader and loyalty officer both having guns on him.  Oh, and one guy got a posthumous promotion to Hero of the Complex when he poked the registered pyrokinetic too many times and she vapourised him.

To be fair she then won back 5 peversity points by brazenly trying to pass it off as a random spontanious combustion, despite being a registere pyrokinetic.  And pointing at him when he went up in flames.

I've been making some inroads on the new 40k rulebook, and will likely post some stuff over the weekend when I make my concerted effort to dig in."

"event","Well, I am going to be putting in an order for 5th edition in on monday.  I think I'll try and get the collectors edition, because I might as well.  I'll put up a review of the full rules when I have them, but for now I'll put on my random thoughts based on what I've seen so far.

Based on the WD review and the like I have mixed feelings.  The fact that my tanks can't be beaten to death by marines in close combat is good.  As is the ability to ram my A 14 tanks into a peon and squash them flat.  The fact my swathes of troops will be useful for capturing the objectives compared to most forces tiny troop compliment is also pretty good.  Oh, and the things i can do with blast markers these days.  Wow!

Bad side?  I can't shoot through my own guys without giving a 4+ save.

Guard HAVE to focus firepower.  They have to protect flimsy blocks of heavy weapons with expendable blocks of troopers.  Now I have to spread out into a long line, and put my lascannons and the like in the same line as the normal guys.  This is a Bad Thing.  On the plus side, I can still put tank guns and ordinance carridges behind a wall of guns.  But it's going to be tricky to work this for a while.

On the whole though, I think things should be better.  My last game involved bugs hammering through my guys by consolidating right into combat and glancing my tanks to death.  Lack of both would have helped a lot.  Admittedly I did lose because he had several bugzillas. :P  But it was still fun hammering heavy mortar rounds into packed gaunts.  54 in the first round killed!"

"event","Just to start things off with some work news.  I was under the impression that I would be moving to my new department at either the start of June or when my current project was all tied up, whichever happens first.  Then I was told by the manager we have gotten in while the old one ties thins up before quitting that I was going on the first of June depending on if the old boss would let me.  So that was bad.

  Then the new boss must have moved heaven and earht, and I go on monday.  Yay!  This comes after his Christmas-Card-List making comment when he offhandedly lamented needing to fill my shoes with at least 1 and a half developers to meke up for the amount of work I can shift.  He = The Star.

  Now, onto the review!

  The Ruins is a fantbulous book by Scott Smith, and apparently is already a pretty decent looking film.  I reccomend both, although from reviews i have heard the book is way better.  9/10.  Go look for it.

  Sadly I can't give more detail without spoilers, and this is such a good book I can't go without that.  I honestly think you should get the book, see the film, then read the rest of the review.  See you soon. :D

  Ok, that was quick. :)  Glad you're back.

  My first comment is that I was surprised to see the other books that this guy has done.  He appears to stick mostly to hard crime and gritty drama than horror, but good on him!  This is a tense, evil little story that os blacker than black.  No punches are pulled, and the way he leaves everything open that needs to be left open is brilliant.  While I have no idea that this is the case, I can't help but feel that the release of the film has tilted the books surprise factor away a little.  My copy has a cover with the vines gripping a machette.  They could not have spelled out the villain of this piece in any more detail unless it also had a picture of a kitten being eaten by the vines, while another bundle held up a hockey mask.

  On that note, those vines have inspired me to write this thing up as a CoC scenario.  Ancient Mayan mines filled with blood-sucking, acid-sapped super vines?  Yes plz!

  My only complaints about the whole book are that the characters are so...generic.  There is the Leader, the Slut, the Angry Girl, the One That Goes Crazy...It was pretty easy to see from the opening paragraphs who would go where.  That might, on the other hand, be considered good and robust characterisation.  I knew who would go where because I could identify, easily, who had what kind of personality based on the writing.

  As well as that there was the fact that the vine was a super-ninaj-genius-dickweed.  It knew how to lure them in, how to play on the teens fears, how to make them tick.  It knew how to conceal everything, including how smart it was, until the last moment.  The complete bastardry it got up to put it on a level beyond many other characters in many other books I have read.  I mean...it ate a dead body in a sleeping bacg, then pretended the person was still alive just to mess with them!  You, Mr Vine, are a dick!

  Well enough of the book.  From what I have heard the film is going to be a pretty straight remake, although it will suffer from Hollywood-itis.  That includes an '...Or is it?' ending, and the removal of a lot of the tension.  Punches will be pulled.  Still, I'm planning on grabbing it at the cinema."

"event","City of the living dead is one of those odd Italian films that somehow tries to marry the Cthulhu Mythos with zombies and odd, random ideas.  Other examples include The Beyond, where the Book of Eibon is used to open a gate to hell, resulting in zombies, people being eaten by giant spiders, and other fun stuff.
  In this case the Mythos connection is that the action takes place in the town od Dunwich, which in this particular world was built on the ruins of Salem.  A priest hangs himself, thus opening a door to hell, and all kinds of fun activities ensue.
  The plot follows two groups of people, one a medium and a reporter, the other a few Dunwitch residents.  The reporter and medium know that soon the shit is going to hit the fan in a 'dead walking the earth' kind of way, while the others are tying to work out who is killing people in town.  The answer to group 2's quaetion is simple. The priest is walking about killing people, and the people he kills get up and kill.
  In one particular sequnece it is shown that these zombies all have the power to give people the evil eye.  In fact the eye is SO evil it makes the affected persons eyes bleed.
  And they they throw up thier entire digestive system.
  In reverse.
  Ouch!
  So anyway, Dunwitch's population drops as All Saints Day (the deadline for the evil) draws near.  The reporter and medium turn up at the graveyard, where they need to be to stop the evil happening and...
  They go several miles away into town to convince the other party that they are right.  They gat a +10 bonus to persuasion when a) it rains maggots for 3 solid minutes and b) a family is butchered by a ghost nearby.
  The dunwitch dwellers grab the survivour of the murders and go to the funeral home, which is next to the cemetary.  They vow to take care of the problem right then and there!  They send a kid home with one of the women in the group.  The women gets killed and the child chaced through town.  Just as one of the zombies is about to attack...
  The reporter, doctor and mystic turn up and save them.  In other words, with the clock ticking down, they buggered off again.  Nice work, assholes!
  So, finally no longer distracted, the adventurers go the the graveyard.  They waste more time staring at random things like trees, gravestones and the like.  Eventually they decend into the bowls of the earth, which is filled with dusty zombies.  They find the evil priest zombie and stab it with a bit of wood.  For some reason this causes it to burst into flames.  For some reason that causes all the other zombies to burst into flames.  Don't ask me.
  Well, the day is saved...or is it?  As the remaining heros stagger into the sunlight they start freaking out, and then a cheezy animated effect splits the screen like it was being eaten up with cracks.  Hmmm, maybe if you guys hadn't decided that you had plenty of time when you knew the deadline for destruction was approaching the world would still have been saved.  Thanks again, assholes. >_<
  The film is, to be honest, good.  The odd 'random' effects are very good, as they do help to bring a sense that there is a real buildup of evil evergy.  The rain of maggots was disgusting, and the little touches like the high winds and dust being blown around really added to the atmosphere.  The zombies are all over the place, and the little hints at the Mythos connection are nice.
  The problems are little things like, well the effects.  The zombies, apart from 2, look really...juicy.  Like a burns victim that has been hosed with gunk.  The dusty zombies look totally different, as does the evil priest.  In fact, there is little to no internal consistancy within the zombies.  These guys also seem more likely to crush someone's brains that eat them.  I recall at least 3 kills where the zombie grabbed the back of a persons head and crushes the head open, ripping out brains.
  There is also the little problem that the good guys KNOW they have, at one point 12 hours, to save the earth.  Then they stand about.  And talk.  And leave the area they need to be.  And walk about.  And lounge.  And talk on the phone...In other words, they just stagger about wasting precious time while arty camera angles ensue.
  Still, on the whole this is a good little film.  The gore was not as gratioutous or over the top as The Beyond, and is well worth a watch.  I give it a 7/10."

"event","So, yesterday had little flurries of snow and hail.  This was good mainly because I had said (as if I have even the first clue about the weather) that we were due snow yesterday to some people at work.  Sure, it didn't settle, but that still counts.

  This morbning I wake up and everything is covered in snow.  Holy craphats!  It melted around 4ish, but with the temperature plunging and clouds in the sky, chances are it'll be here gain tomorrow.

  Before I do my belated review, I'll mention work.

  To imagine my current situation accurately, go get an episode of Dilbert.  Preferably 2 or 3 strips.  Now, cut out all the ones that show Dilbert, so you are left only with the managers.  Shuffled those cells in any order so you have a huge swathe of managers talking about stuff and coming up with plans.

  Now put one cell with Dilbert being told he has to do all the aformentioned plan, and protesting that it can't be done.  Like as not the manager is telling him to think positive.

  Congratulations!  You now have the most accurate rendition of my work life right now. :D

  Blargh.

  On with the review!

  Rinne, or Reincarnation, is a J horror film with a similar-ish plot to the usual 'film crew go to spooky mansion to make a film about the grizly murders that happened there, ghosts kill them' flicks that come put all the time.  The differences with this one is a) the plot hook is not 'ghosts kill everyone' so much as 'the reincaranted spirits all come back to re-enact the deaths' and b) it's done a damn sight less 'tongue in cheek' than a lot of western filsm of the same nature.  The result is an all-round nice little film that keeps up a constant stream of half-seen subtle supernatural occurances while driving the plot forward at a reasonable pace.

  My only major gripe is that the heroine keeps fainting and flaking out.  Earlier in the film an actress is turned down at thr auditions for claiming she is a reincarated murder victom (and is pretty chirpy about the whole thing).  The director, in the meantime, is perfectly happy to let his female lead vanish from her room, stagger blindly about an abandoned hotel, and faint at the drop of a hat, without giving her so much as a dressing down.

  Seriously, if it was me, and I was making a film about a bunch of mysterious deaths, and ANYONE from catering upwards started acting oddly, they'd be off the set in an instant.  Mind, I would probably also leave the set and phone things in at that point, given that there are set to be few survivours of the inevitable shitstorm that is brewing.

  I'll give this one a solid 8/10 and a reccomend if you like J horror.  The final plot twist is pretty good, especially given that it moves the entire plot in a direction that these things seldom (if ever) go in.  Good work lads!"

"event","As various people know, I have been very stressed over work.  Now I have stopped being so.  Sadly the release has left me feeling a little restless so I can't sit through any long films. :P  So no review this week.  Please don't be worried though ,I am feeling a great deal less stressed now.
  Thanks to a zombie-themed book I recieved I have been thinking of ways to keep calm during my current tardstorm of a project.  In the end I have hit upon a solution.  Thanks to work being so secrative, and this place being so public, I will not share the exact details.  Suffice to say I realised that despite what my manager has said, I cared TOO MUCH about meeting the deadline he set.  Every decision that I have been stressing out over, ever management mess up, every time I have been told to do the work one stupid way after another, have all boiled down to one common thread; Doing the way I am asked to is a) stupid b) will waste time and c) will require work to be redone and d) mean that testing will have to be skipped.  Each of these decisions and directions I have railed against, only to be told to do it the way they told me too.  *Shrug*  Meh.
  By caring about hitting the deadline I was getting more and more stressed about things.  Then I kicked back and decided 'Who cares?'  I've put in a transfer to another department (even more secretive than the current one!) and am going to give that a shot.  If that falls through, or my manager insists I cant move for the rest of the year, then I'll think of something else.
  In the meantime I'll just de-stress and let the project stagger along at the pace they want it to go at.  If it falls down, all I can say is 'I told you so a month ago...again!'  I have a ton of I Told You So's stored up now. :P"

"event","There is always one sort of horror film that is dmaned likely to offend me.  That kind is where a team of soldiers/national guardsmen/space marines/generic military types go into a situation and get picked off one by one.  This is usually because they try and imitate better films of that sub-genre, like Aliens for example.  There have been some good examples, like Dog Soldiers and The Bunker.  Hills Have Eyes 2 is NOT one of these films.
  The filrst fill was easy on the brain, and so was this one.  However, the team of soldiers in question was incompitent on a level with the last half hour of 28 Days Later.  They split up, even when they know they are in a hostile environment.  They always leave equipment where it can be swiped by the ninja-like radioactive canibals.  They argue.  They try and tough it through situations that require brains.  They all stand round looking at the current shiniest event in proximity to them while leaving something they need near a hole in the ground, or while one of the party wanders off without telling people where they are going.
  In other words, think Aliens, but reduce the IQ of all the participants by 50-60% and allow them to be outmanouvred by people that have lived in a mine for several generations.  Seriously people.  Jelly babies could likely outsmart these morlocs.
  My main issue with this oen is not that it is predictable, as the last one was too.  It is just...bad.  I can see that they wanted to make a good film, but they failed.  Again, you could tell who was going to survive from early on.  My only 'tiwst' in this respect was that both the women leads survived.  I expected one of them to die.  One was captured and raped.  I'll give you all a clue; it was not the blue-eyed, blonde one.
  Other errors include the way that (without warning) all of them suddenly are without helmets.  Plus, the two women are used as bait to draw the killers out.  For no well explored reason, one of them removes all but her undershirt (including all extra equipment).  When they have sprung the trap and the combat is over, she does not get dressed again.  And thus, she spends the rest of the dangerous combat situations running around in a shirt.  I wonder why that was?
  There was also the 'good' hillbilly again.  Why?  Why would someone that was raised on a diet of human flesh and daily violence suddenyl decide to help people?  This was never explored.  He was shown in the opening trying to help someone too, so it's not like he developed sympathy half way through the film.  he was godo to begin with...apparently.
  All in all a sub-par no brainer that somehow managed to be so stupid that my brain kicked in reflexively to look at the plot holes.  4/10  Must try harder."

"event","I knew that the hills have eyes was going to offend me.  However, the main problem is that there are not many people that like hardcore horror.  The result is thatI have to have some low-grade slashers tucked away when I want to run horror nights, or put on a film that is merely scary.  As a result, if I see some dross in a 5-for-whatever sale, then I tend to pick them up.  As a result, along with Poultergiest, Mirrormask and Saw 3, I made better value for money by grabbing the Hills have Eyes remake and sequel.
  Today, you get the remake, next week the sequel.  Why am I not skipping to do Mirrormask?  because it did not offend me as much as I thought it would.
  There are some crippling, crippling flaws in the logic of this film.  The only person that knows there are cannibals on the loose is the same one to leave the doors to the caravan open and let them in.  The cannibal child dies to save the normal family for no well explored reason.  The family guard dog is a lethal human-eating machine that kills (by my count) 2 cannibals without breaking stride, yet is fine to have around kids.
  There is also the problem that after 5 minutes I knew exactly who was going to die, and who would survive.  I mean, you could tell.  Mostly because, well they didn't die when they had the chance.  I mean, you can tell which people will die, which mutants will die, and which dog will die!  It's entirely unchallenging.  It's entirely predictable.  it's almost without tension.  But it is not as insulting as I thought it would be.

This is one of the reasons that I stopped posting so often, as I was solidly working on Summoning for the best part of the last year, as well as the start of this one.
  As a result, I am incapable of telling people >exactly< why I have to miss this years student nationals (an event I paid for in advance and one of the 2 regular hollidays I ask for a year).  This is because it involves a project I am working on right now.  I feel safe to say that the reason for me being unable to go is because a recent shift in deadlines simply made it so that it was unsafe for me to be in Sheffield in case any bugs turned up over the one day I was away, and the weekend.
  In other words, a rolling deadline has kicked me firmly in the balls.
  Yes, we do have other developers that could cover for me for three days.  Why do you ask?  Oh wait, you mean you thought that after lashing my back raw over a sudden urgent project, the first thing they would have thought of was to give me a carrot in the form of a weekend away by covering for me?  Me too.  Apparently not.  It must be one of those things you learn on a management training course.
  I am significantly several paces south of happy.  I cannot discuss future projects, of course, but if it is unsafe for me to take a long weekend where I am away from the office in case of bugs, and this project moves how I think it will given current evidence, then you can scale forward the 'no time off for you' until July to Septemeber.

"event","People are quite divided on the Saw films.  Some lump them in with the 'torture porn' genre that seems to have taken over the horror mainstream these days, while others complain about the length and predictability of the plot twists.  In fact, the plot twists are not really predictable, it is merely predictable that there will be some thier-cat plot twist that you'll never have seen coming.
  Regardles, I think that on the whole so far the franchise that I have seen is above 5 out of 10 in all cases, although only just in the case of 2.  Plus, the twists genuinely make you nod and appreciate the way that Jigsaw seems to make people do exactly what they should not do if they want to survive.
  Three is pretty much more of the same, although it features infinately more likable people than in 2.
  Given the vast anf twisty nature of the film, I will not go into it in detail.  The plot, however, relies on two seperate games.  In the first, a doctor that is in anti depressants and failing her patients is grabbed by Jigsaws apprentice and brought to tend him.  She has to keep him alive, no matter what, as if he dies a collar of shotgun shells will blow her head clean off.
  In the second game, a burned out man who lost his child in a hit and run accident and has been obsessing over it for years is presented with a series of games.  In each he is presented with one of the people he blames for the death, and has the power to save them or forgive them as he sees fit...
  This fim is a marked improvement over 2, which tried to pack as many people into the film as possible so they could have as many traps as possible.  As a result, the plot of 2 and it's twist want downhill and seemed rushed to me.  In addition, the actual nature of the traps were all truncated in roder to fit them in.
  This films major failing over Saw is that it spends too long standing there looking at things.  By that I mean, we get a long flashback to all the events that followed 1 and 2, with prologue to those films.  We also see the man in the second test standing there gawping.  A lot.  There is a lot of fluff that could have been removed from thsi film.  The downside being that it would, as a result, have been less than a hour long.
  But that's the problem when you are told to get one film per halloween without fail.  You have to skimp on the details and just pack in filler.
  Anyway, 7/10 and a reccomend for people with strong constitutions.  Not to be seen seperately, you'll have to watch 1 and 2 to 'get' this film."

"event","If you are unaware of the plot of the film Poultergeist, and can't take a guess at it, then you may be in trouble. :P
  This is a classic, and as such I don't intend to go into full details as that would spoil it for anyone that has not yet seen the film.  I was delighted to see it on DvD after so long, as up until now only 2 has been readily available on the right region.  I was a little dissapointed by the special effects, as they have not, in the main, dated terribly well.  They are a cross between anamatronics, dummy corpses, camera tricks like superimposure and animation.  However, they don't really detract from the film (except at the 'face-peeling' moment, which is pretty shoddy).
  The plot, in brief, is that a suburban familiy with a pretty creepy daughter suddenly find thier lives invaded by the poultergeist and it's palls, who procede to rain heavilly on thier parade.  Imagine if Jaws was not a shark, but a horrible ghost.  That's the film.  And, like Jaws, it's one you have to see.  8/10, solid reccomend.
  That out of the way, I have to discuss WHY the film scored so low for a classic 'must-see' movie.
  As I said above, this film has taken a while to pop up on the DvD shelving at most local places.  In the meantime I made do with the sequal, which is also a massive must-see.  Not least of which beacuse of Julian Beck as preacher Kane.  I don't think that any earthly make up could make a human being like a wizzened and evil looking as this man.  He's genuinely frightening as a human being!  He's like Angus Scrim, aka the Phantasm series Tall Man.  If it was not for the sad demise of several series regulars, I feel that Poultergeist would have been another Halloween or Friday the 13th.
  Anyway, while waiting for the film to become available, I made do with the book.  And while the film is good, the book is better.  The main problem here is that the book...made more sense than the film.  If all the parts that were left out of the books were made into the film, it would likely be about an hour longer.  But the problem is, having read it, I can see why it is needed to make the film even better then it is.  Things like the apports, the origins of the tiny medium, the real reason behind the haunting, as well as the beast and the lady on the stairs are all laid out.
  I can see WHY they were cut it all, as it is a lot of background material that could have made the film drag.  But in my opinion, having see the film and read the book, I'll stick to the book in future.  The second film, on the other hand, is good by its self, and I would rather watch it."

"event","Ok, here is a quick recap of my last fortnight, although filtered by my uausl paranoia about leaks.  Not this week, but the week before, I worked a surreal 7 1/2 days in one week, while starting to come down with the flu.  This was to ensure everything was on track for Summoning, and then on track for the update we did on Thursday.  Obviously, that kind of time-dilation didn't do my cold much good, so I was planning on zoning out that weekend with bags of medication to keep myself happy.
  But then my 9 year old monitor died.  So I had to walk through the rain to get a new one.  This did not help things in the slightest.
  So, I spent most of last week hacking my lungs up, getting sympahtetic and/or disgusted looks, and blowing my nose loudly.  I was more than a little feverish, and looked like crap, but since I could still type, and had a skill still newly out, there was no way I could justify to myself taking time off.  So I worked all last week, which didn't exactly help the cold speed to it's end.
  Now, with the skill out I'm a lot less stressed, and not looking down the barrel of huge wedges of overtime.  So a lot of my happy has come back.  I am also not coughing EVERY time I talk, which is also an improvement.  Players seemed to hate it at first because of the cost, but with that going down the complaines have petered away to virtually nothing.  So that's also good.
  I'll try and have a review tomorrow, but I can't promise anything.  I have decided to clean my flat from top to bottom, which is a big chunk of work, so I might not have film-time."

"event","Oh those wacky Italians.

This is one of the great Brava/Argento collaborations, which could only have been made better with music by Goblin, the usual people to provide score for this kind of work.  See the Youtube scores for Phenomena and Profundo Rosso for the kind of work these wizards of keyboardery perform.

Spoilers ensue.  If you want to skip them, then this film  is a solid 7/10 if you like watching horror films alone, and probably boosts to a 9/10 if you have a good group to bash it.

While there is some attempt to establish the heroine and her friend, as well as a lot of the other zombie fodder, in the opening section of the film, the action really picks up when they get to the theatre.  All of the patrons have been handed a ticket by a guy in black biker leathers and a half-mask made from metal in the shape of an evil face.

At the theatre (which has a lot of Argento posters in the lobby, as well as one that I think is from Creepshow and an AC-DC poster) there is one of the coolest centrepieces in the world.  A big, light up platform with a bike on it.  Being ridden by a ninja.  With a samurai sword.

It should be noted that this film is very 80's.  That means lots of big hair, sleeveless shirts and leather jackets.  I think it was shot in Berlin, and I have no idea what language it was in.  A lot of the time it LOOKS dubbed and the voices sound like voice actors, but more often than not the words exactly match the lips, which makes things confusing.

Anyway, it is at this point we are introduced to the star of the show, King Pimpzor of Pimp Mountain.  This is the only black character in the film, and rather then be some token, comic relief as many Hollywood films might have cast him, he is a powerhouse of badassery.  I can't recall the character ever being named, hence, I will call him king.  In this scene he turns up with 2 women, one of whom cuts her face on a demon mask in the lobby. He then growls through some opening lines and commands the attention of everyone in the room.

Seriously, if this guy hadn't died later on I could see him having his own series of films where he glared demons to death or kicked them in half with the power of his pimptasticness.

So, the main point of the film is semi-explained in the film-within-a-film, also called Demons.  Everyone sits down to watch, with His Majesty being poked by the usherette for smoking, the fussy upper-class couple getting annoyed at their antics, and the young horny couple making out.  There is a blind guy, who's daughter sneaks off for make-out time during the film too.

That action aside, the main plot is on the screen at this time.

In the film, 2 couples ride out to a newly-collapsed tomb complex where Nostradamus was supposed to be buried.  They troop inside, with some really corny acting, and discover his tomb.  Inside there is only a book and the same mask that the woman cut herself on.  One of the characters cuts himself on the mask too, and things begin to go down hill on and off screen.

The woman that cut herself heads out to the ladies because her face starts bleeding.  While there she feels ill, and a huge boil of greeny-yellow puss erupts under her skin.  Her friend goes to find her, and is killed by the now transformed demon.  She stumbles behind the screen, busting out just in time to transform in front of the screaming patrons.

The other demon has, at this point, also strangled the blind mans daughter and her boyfriend.  He makes a reappearance, falling from the balcony with a plush red rope around his neck.  This prompts the usual screaming panic that you might assume in these circumstances.

Now, to give a quick description of the demons.  When you turn into a demon you get very pale, with networks of red veins at random places on your face and neck.  Your hands turn into huge claws, and you get a mouth full of teeth so big and sharp it's unlikely you'd ever close your jaws again.  You also vomit green slime, look sweaty and nasty in general, and make 'grabby-hands' at people while yelling 'rar!' through a voice distorter.

The film is, in the strictest sense of the word, a zombie film.  Fast zombies, by all means, but the demons are pretty much zombies.  They don't eat people, but do bite them.  They are stronger than the human norm, and spread the disease through contact.  The supernatural trimmings make them demons, but the whole thing could easily have been the T Virus for all someone walking in halfway would have cared.

Anyway, His Majesty runs back to the lobby, just as the frenzied mob manages to rip the sealed front doors off their hinges, showing the flat, featureless wall behind them.  he yells for calm, and commands everyone to go looking for emergency exits.  Which they do without question.

A demon attacks someone, and is sealed in a side room by His Majesty and a random peon lugging a vending machine over the door.  The King shows his awesome wisdom as the heroine babbles that the film must be causing the problem.  Rather then (like one other character) going 'bullshit, there must be another explanation for the frenzies, bile-spitting demons we have encountered' he leads the mob to the projection booth.

There he kicks down the door, and they all find that the film was being run automatically.  He steps up to the mark and DESTROYS one of the machines with his bare hands, thus turning off the film.

However, the injured blind guy pops back up, when the survivors gather on the balcony.  He tells them that the film was not the problem, but the theatre is.  There is the a demon attack when the King becomes one of only 3 people to kill a zombie in the film.  he whips out a switchblade and stabs the demon hard enough to send him tumbling over the railings and into the lower aisle of the theatre.

The film then drops into a zombie siege movie.  The blind guy escapes and attacks some cops who were, themselves, chasing some gangers that get into the theatre.  They spent a while developing these characters (to the detriment of the other cast) and then killed them all offscreen, which was a bit annoying.

The hero and heroine follow the hero's friend to the lobby where he turns into a demon, and the hero kills him with the sword from the statue.  Unable to face the horror, the heroine staggers back into the theatre, and is about to be managed by the grabby-handed ghouls, when the hero rides in on the bike (why did it have petrol in?) and proceeds to hack apart the monsters while riding up and down the isles.

Eventually, the vast proportion of the beasts are killed, and a helicopter crashes through the ceiling.  No, I have no idea why either.  My only guess is that it tried to park on the roof, and it was unable to take the weight.  The last few zombies approach, and are taken out when the hero gets the rotors moving for a moment, causing much hacky goodness.

The pair get into the roof using the grappling hook, winch and harness that ALL helicopters just happen to have.  At that point Half-Mask appears and tries to kill them, only to end up harpooned by the grappling hook, and then impaled onto a broken spar made when the helicopter appeared.

The two then realise that the demons have overrun the city.  Cars are on fire, people are being attacked left, right and centre.  They flee through the streets, and are picked up by a survivalist family that have a bag of Uzis in the back of the jeep they are in.

Bwah?

So yes, they start driving west, towards an uncertain future.  The credits begin rolling, then pause for the heroine to turn into a demon, only to get plugged by the survivalist kid and fall off the jeep.  The credits resume rolling.

So, what have we just watched, and is it worth the time you spent?

Demons is a good little zombie film with a lot more pluses than minuses.  The plot and pace is fast and furious.  The effects are pretty good, and are all physical, given the time it was made.  There are a lot of kills, gross outs, and some boobs.  It's never campy, and retains a serious tone the whole time.  Sure there are plot holes big enough to drive a sword-wielding ninja biker through, but you just don't care.

It's well worth the time to watch, and I have to try and get my hands on Demons 2 at some point."

"event","Happy Christmas and a good new year to all!  As many of you know (or don't) one of the main reasons I have been so pooped from work is because for the past year and a half at least, I've been working my dexterous fingers to the bone of the new skill for the game.  The resultant lack of anything new in my work life has made things rather dull, which is one of the reasons I have decided to post reviews for the time being, as that gives me something interesting to talk about.

As I had to be here at work in order to make sure all those last t's are crossed and i's dotted, my Christmas and new year was spent working or spending the time like any other weekend, but with more phone calls to family, and 200% more presents than usual.

One of those presents was a voucher for HMV, which I spent to grab 28 Weeks Later, as well as Bottom series 2 and Severance.  There WILL be a review of Severance up later, as I have decided to try and do one review a week, simply to keep up with people.

28 Weeks Later had been on the bottom of my shopping list for a while.  Sure, I wanted to see it, but I also remember how teeth-grittingly pants the last quarter of it's predecessor had been.  It's not that Days succeeded at being a bad film, it merely failed to be a good one.  If you see what I mean.

Weeks was...also not a good film.  It was better then some, and worse than others.  Hence, I have no desire to spoiler it for anyone that wishes to watch it.  As a review, I'll give it 6.5/10, and if you liked Days, or like the other works of the director, then you'll probably want to give it a rent at least.

However, I am going to keep typing for two reasons.  First, I like to hear myself 'talk' and second, because, like Days, there were some huge plot holes that I would like to bitch about.  Some spoilers are contained in this whining, so some of you might want to cut off reading...here!

Hole 1 - Access all areas really means what it says.

In the opening section of the film, where the father is reunited with his kids, he explains that he is pretty much a civilian trustee caretaker, and has an access all areas passcard.  he later uses this card to stride happily into the centre of the medical wing in order to see his wife and begin the infection process anew.  Now, I'm no expert, but why the hell is the head caretaker given a pass that allows access to anything other then the civilian areas?  Especially high clearance military biohazard zones?  If someone, anyone, had thought to keep the two zones separate, the film would have likely been a lot shorter, and had a happier ending.

Also, why the hell was there no physical, flesh-and-blood guard on the infected woman?  They had one sitting with the kids, why not her, especially as they were unsure as to her infection status?

Hole 2 - The military are malevolent...again!

The part that really, REALLY pissed me off in Days was when the military showed up, and showed that they were unable to so much as cook eggs correctly, let alone perform military operations.  That might have been put down to combat psychosis, last-man-standing syndrome, or even bad acting.  But I blame the writing.  Sure, the ending was better then the planned one (as shown on the extras) but even I, a total civvy, was able to see through the gaping, massive holes in how the military was portrayed.

And the same thing happened again.

I admit, someone clearly took Boyle aside and told him how the military really reacted, but there were still some signs that he was just making it up.  For example, there was a surplus of malevolent things for them to do, like the bombers loaded with napalm ready to wipe out the centre of the infected zone, and the nerve-gas on standby.  I mean, how much gas would they need stockpiled to blanket London?

There was also the problem that the military was clearly told to kill everyone.  Now, when the infection first got out of control, and the civilians were pouring into the firing zone, that's not a problem.  I can hand them that.  However, the next day, when they see some people IN A CAR, they open fire on them.  The infected can barely put one foot in front of another, and here the army is, flamethrowering someone that is is clearly uninfected, and wearing one of their own uniforms!

Jesus...cool down a little man!

Hole 3 - Nobody learn ed anything.

The infected are as strong as a normal, angry man.  Thus, the sensible precaution would be, when herding the civilians into a shelter, to put strong shutters over the door to a) prevent infected getting in and b) prevent infected getting out.

The doors on the shelter were taken out by 1 infected guy.  Nobody had learned anything.

The infected spray infected blood that will turn you if it gets into your eyes, mouth or blood.  Thus, all people expected to combat them or come into contact with them should wear something to protect the eyes and mouth, as standard.

Nope!  That would prevent us from seeing those expensive, expensive actors!  Thus, the chief medical officer chats with the infected woman with only a SARS mask on, and no military guy wore so much as a hanky wrapped around their mouth.

There is a deadly, fast-spreading virus loose in the UK.  The sensible precaution for all nations not crippled by it (which in the Laterverse is everyone but the mainland UK) should have set measures for controlling the virus.

Well, if the end of the film is anything to go by, the French seemed to have not bothered.  Nobody learned anything.

There are many, many other problems I can poke into this film, but to be honest, those are the big three.  That and a lot of the others tie into them.  Like the military being malevolent and shutting all the civvies into a bunker and then shutting off the lights and thinking this is a good plan.  But other then that it was a better then average film.  See my pre-spoiler score and tentative recommendation."

"event","Yes, I am alive.  No I have not really done anything other then eat, sleep and code.  Yes I will attempt to post here more often.  Here is proof, a review of the Tomes of the Dead instalment; Death Hulk!

This book is apparently the first in a series of books from the eclectic Abbadon Press label.  Apparently, not knowing their niche, the publishers have titles from new writers that are all supposed to be parts of long, long chains, assuming they make any money.  Thus, the dust jacket for Tomes of the Dead is stacked neatly next to a book about a steampunk London alternate future.

Regardless, I bought this book a while ago in FP, and have yet to see the sequel that is spoilered in the back few pages.

Note, there are so many recurring themes in this, I am going to have to use acronyms.

The plot is simple; during the Napoleonic era, an Evil French Ship (EFS) is raiding Good English Ships (GES) that are trying to get supplies through some sea route.  Heroic English Captain (HEC) along with his Heroic English Crew (Also HEC) are dispatched to defeat them.  Sure, the enemy ship is better then them, but (as the HEC keeps reminding the Also HEC) 'one English sailor is better then 10 french sailors'.  Here is time for another acronym.  The phrase 'One English sailor is worth 10 french sailors!' is used all the time in this book, for all kinds of reasons.  It is usually accompanied by other derogatory statements as to the parentage, physical appearance and hygiene of the French.  Hence 'mildly racists chest-beating' becomes MRCB.  Eyes peeled kids, spotting MRCB could become a drinking game.

So off they sail.  Characters develop.  There is some rumour that the French are using dead soldiers on the mainland to attack and overwhelm the living forces of good old blighty.  MRCB!

They find the EFS and shoot it a lot, using Awesome English Daring Do.  Both ships are wounded, but the French get the worst of it.  Rather then go for the unrealistic 'then they repaired and set off to hunt it again' that a lot of less realistic books would use, they head off to look for timber, all the while joking about how bad the French were in the fight.  MRCB!

They put in on a little island, and trade wood with the locals while being patronising at them.  One man is killed by a big cat of some sort, and another is found reduced to a handful of bones and a bad smell.  The HEC blames the natives.  Repairs are carried out quickly, as the Also HEC are eager to get away from the island and smite the French before they repair fully.  MRCB!

Of to sea once more (with a scurvy-averting helping of fresh fruit) the GES is tailed by a Sinister French Ship (SFS).  The HEC uses his awesome ship-fu and manages to corner the elusive SFS, and makes a boarding action.  Then...holy flying bejeebus hats!  Zombies!  The crew manages to adapt to this threat remarkably quickly, and manage to get away from the SFS, where they limp to a hiding place and the stirrings of mutiny begin.

At this point, the HEC's Dark, Sinister Secret (DSS) is laid out. Apparently, his grandfather, who is praised for sinking a lot of EFS's was, in fact, a complete bastard.  Instead of launching a suicidally brave charge into a French port, where he slew hundreds of Frenchmen armed with only his stiff upper lip (a feat for which he was elevated to some really high nautical rank and given enough medals to choke a yak), what happened was that he shelled French colonists until the ships protecting them had to sacrifice themselves to let the women and babies get to freedom.

Why is this relevant?  Because one of the ships that went down just so happens to be the one now chasing the GES looking to eat the crew.

Oh, the stirrings of mutiny are dispelled.  How?  The HEC tells the Also HEC that they are going to shoot some living Frenchmen while they tend to the dying and wounded from the sea battle, and that since the zombies are French, they will be able to beat them easily now.  MRCB!

I am not joking by the way.

Anyhow; all jazzed up at the idea of finding the French base, sneaking up on them and stabbing them while the sleep, they set sail once more.  The EFS is spotted and tailed to an idyllic island.  The GES sails around the back that night, and a furious battle ensues!  Wounded, sleepy Frenchmen wave their scurvy-infected limbs at the Also HEC and the HEC as they carve through them, and the few healthy marines that protect them.  In the heat of the battle, after the HEC disarms his counterpart by headbutting him and kicking him while he is down in the middle of the duel, he spots the Evil Zombie Captain (EZC) and goes to have a fight with him.  The EZC mocks him and promises vague harm to the HEC, before disarming him and walking off.

The HEC wins the battle, and are just engaging in a healthy round of MRCB when a wounded figure staggers like an overused plot device from the treeline and tells them all that the zombies have sunk the GES and killed all the crew left to guard it.  Just to prove he is an overused plot element, he manages to say all this with only mild pauses for wincing, then dies.

The Also HEC abandon the French prisoners to the zombies (I kid you not) and get on the EFS.  The low quality of hygiene on the ship is discussed at length (MRCB!) as they try to outrun the SFS.  They fail, and zombies pour onto the EFS while the HEC and EZC have a final showdown.  The Also HEC runs for the lifeboats, and the HEC beats the EZC in a duel, only to stand there and wait for him to get back up.  EZC's puzzled expression lasts only for a moment before the EFS's magazine blows up, killing everyone on board.

Well, not everyone.  Apparently HEC is immune to explosions, as the three remaining Also HEC find him and start rowing for a nearby island.

On the whole, this book was an enjoyable read.  It wasn't >badly< written, but there were a lot of issues that kept popping up.  90% of the character problems and crew motivation boiled down to MRCB and nothing more.  No pep-talk ended without the line about '1 English sailor' followed by mad cheering.  Even when the HEC faced down the mutinous Also HEC, all he did to calm them was say 'well, the sooner we kill those Frenchmen, the sooner we can go home, and that'll be easy because...'  There was also a lot of predictability here.  The HEC is seen to be relatively shy when discussing his grandfather's awesome heroics, and is all shocked when they see the name of the SFS for the first time.  Hence, I was underwhelmed when the DSS was revealed.  Also, in the island encounter, the EZC was a nigh-unstoppable behemoth, while on the ship, he was literally disarmed by the HEC easily.

These bad points aside, it's an enjoyable read for anyone that like combining Hornblower with Dawn of the Dead.  Swash is buckled, decks are swabbed, cannons roar.  It's a good mindless read, and I am still looking for the others in the series based on the strength of this opening number.  7/10"

"event","I have quite a lot to say about this, and I am going to assume that those peopel reading this entry have, in fact, seen the film in question.
  I liked it.  So sue me.  I have seen mixed and negative reviews acros the board, but as a zombie film, it was good.  It had a more believeable post-zombiegedden society than a lot I have seen, and had consistant internal logic for it's world.  However, as a Romero film I believe that ir was clearly half a movie.
  This film could have been improved by a possible doubling of the runtime.  We really, really walked in half way on this one.  As a result the characters were both 2 dimentional and generic.  The reuctant hero was reluctant because...he was.  The sleezy bad guy was sleezy...just because.  For those of you who have seen the film, please imagine if the following scenes were added to the beginning and tell me that the film would not have benifited from them;
  First, the film would open with a raid done with the reluctant hero entirely in charge.  Nobody would be lost, chatacters would be established, and he sees one zombie (but not the mechanic) ignore the fireworks.  In fact, he has to kill that zombie himself, and nobody believes him that it acted oddly.
  He goes to see the guy in the tower, and explains what happened, and is disbelieved.  More importanly, he says he wants out of the city, and is fold he cannot leave.  The best he is able to get is that he is going to be allowed to retire.
  Meanwhile, on the streets, the black-ops mercenaries that are dropped on the team get into a pissing contest with the zombie hunters, and end up brutally surpressing a civilian food riot orchestrated by the Irish guy.  This explaines why such an obviously trained and armed force are still reluctant round the zombies; they are internal security and have not been trained to fight them.
  Following this, one of the prominent resistance members is shot by the money-grubbing zombie hunter, who dumps him in the garbage, and meets with the guy in the tower to discuss payment.  He then has a conversation with a lower-rnaking underling to make sure he has all the cash he needs to get into the tower.  He possibly visits a loved one at this point to promise them he willget them in, making his character a little less of a generic mook.
  There is a big party in the bar to celebrate the reluctant hero's retirement, and he arranges through the black market to get the car.  At this point he is also responcible for beating up on a drunkem mercenarry in the bar, explaining why the owner thinks he is trouble.
  Now, the scense blend back into the film as it was.  The characters are establisehd, and the pace can continue as it was set in the real film.  I honestly think that would have made the film better.
  Other then that, I believe this is a solid addition to the 'Of the Dead' series.
  Ps, if anyone has skype, I now have a mike, and am all geared up for chat. :D"

There is a Jagex work trip to Tennerief this weekend, and yes I have my shiny new passpoert right there and ready.  b)  I am now firmly wedged in the black, after a year or so of dropping under.  This is because c) I was given another raise and pat on the head for being a good code monkey.
  The next thing to mention is that I will be running Call of Cthulhu on this little work trip for a few people.  Suggestions have been put forward involving using shots for sanity.  This was taken up with great delight by the various interested parties.  I have decided, from the comfort of my high horse, to review thier performance here.
  However, rather then have a huge ass 'plot' and 'how they fucked it up' section, I'll lay the plot on you here, and the review on you later.  The plot is actually one I thought up a while ago, but have never had a chance to run.  It goes a little like this;
  The year is 2010, and there is a full scale energy crisis underway, prompting the government to allow private companies to set up any and all kinds of energy production plants, from green to atomic, all over the place.  The most controvercial of these is the Webster Station, a power station that apparently uses some super secret and super advanced energy production method that produces no harmful emissions.  Atomic Watchdogs and protestors keep on demanding to know what is going on inside, especcialy after the recent announcement that so many peopel were moving to the local area to take advantage of the low energy prices that they were going to build a second facility, which would be a generic atomic station.  This had many people calling for the secrets of the plant, and especcially why they couldn't replicate it's success.
  That's the mundane setup.  What's happening in the background is that the plant is being run by the Conjunction Engine, a Mythos artifact that was created by a sect of Aztec astrologers under the dream-sent direction of some random deity.  When they realised it's potential as a weapon, the sect launched a takeover of the empire, only to be thwarted by the energies of the Engine.
  This is because the Engine can, after the correct prayers, call and bind a Colour out of Space into its central revolving rings.  This Colour is then drained of it's POW in such a way as to keep it alive, and to produce almost totaly clean power through a series of carved pylons.  The only by-product is the dust from the continous series of sacrifices that the owners have to feed the colour to stop it dying.
  That is the basic plot, with the obviously mad scientist that found the thing trying desperately to build another to provide power, and silence anyone that finds out about it.  Add one crowd of meddling investigators and stand well back.  I expect hig casualties on this one, especially when the SAN bottle is half empty."

The years anniversary of my arrival down here passed without me even noticing.  In other news, I picked up some Horrorclix, after the Forbidden plante got some in.  However, they did not have any of the massive Cthulhu's.  Drat!"

"event","I had an amasingly Cthulhu dream last night.  It sort of seguewayed in from a dream where I was wandering about catching trains (a common theme in my dreams).  All of a sudden I was helping my mum claen up a house she had just moved into, which included going into the basement and thsi secret panel I found.
  The basement was ok...if a little spooky.  It contained all sorts of mythos looking tomes and other junk, and had a load of odd noises.  The secret panel was where the mythos stuff was most concentrated.  Overall it was more like a room that had been built over a sealed chamber that ran the height of the house, like some sort of chimney.  I was in there tydying up, and as I left I saw an albino claw-pseudopod come up between the floorboards.  This lead to a load of reaserch, some disapearances of minor dream-people, and me waving some rocks at the floor while yelling incantations.  It was cool. :D"

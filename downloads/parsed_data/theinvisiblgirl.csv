You rank up there with your seduction skills, though you might not know it.
That's because you're a natural at seduction. You don't realize your power!
The root of your natural seduction power: your innocence and optimism.

You're the type of person who happily plays around and creates a unique little world.
Little do you know that your personal paradise is so appealing that it sucks people in.
You find joy in everything - so is it any surprise that people find joy in you?

You bring back the inner child in everyone you meet with your sincere and spontaneous ways.
Your childlike (but not childish) behavior also inspires others to care for you.
As a result, those who you befriend and date tend to be incredibly loyal to you.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>

Under 12: You are a kid at heart. You still have an optimistic life view - and you look at the world with awe.

13-19: You are a teenager at heart. You question authority and are still trying to find your place in this world.

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

30-39: You are a thirtysomething at heart. You've had a taste of success and true love, but you want more!

40+: You are a mature adult. You've been through most of the ups and downs of life already. Now you get to sit back and relax.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatagequiz/"">What Age Do You Act?</a></div>

You fall in love quickly and easily. And very often.

In relationships, you tend to be a bit selfish.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>"

I had to go to my grandparents to eat for that holiday thats today..yea.I forgot what it is but anywayz..There was like 10 people and 4 dogs over there..It doesn't sound like a lot to most people but when you only live with one other person its like ""woah"". It was really boring. This evening my mom decided we should go adopt a family that lost their home because of the hurricane...it was really really depressing though..We saw a ton of families walking around. We couldn't help anyone because no one had any identification or something like that..It's soo boring right now. I'm ready to go back to Cave 9 now. lol. Oh yea! The As I Lay Dying concert was AWESOME! Holy crap! Some guy came out of the mosh pit with his skull cracked! lol..There was like a thousand drunk guys hitting on us though and it was freaking me out..And the day before yesterday was pretty fun. Hehe. We went to the skating rink.eh..stupid but kinda fun..My a$$ hurts from falling so much. Thanx Colin. lol..Auburn lost the game!? mhmm..that really sucked...lol..I really need to remember to update more..yea."

The alarm went off like normal so I could get ready for school.I went into the den and I figured out the power was out..Then as I'm turning around to go back to my room there's two people with flashlights coming up to our house..It freaked me out to see them at 6am lol...So I go to the door and they told my mom that she might want to move our car..We're like umm ok? We looked outside to see why and there's this huge tree just bent over leaning against the powerlines! So our neighbors being the coolest neighbors that they are moved our car for us...lol...yea...so then I notice a police car next door and I told my mom...She goes over there and finds out it's just our neighbor and shes like ""You can stay at our house in case that tree falls""...So here I am at 6AM getting dressed in the dark and walking over to my neighbors who are complete strangers..So we're in their house and I finally get comfortable on their floor and lay down to go back to sleep...Right when I hit the floor the stupid power comes BACK ON..I'm ready to scream. We go home. No cable. No internet. I'm dying. We finally just use the laptop to get online..lol...Ugh, I thought It'd be great not going to school but now that I don't have to I'm bored out of my mind!

it's a vicious cycle.

i was supposed to go to the gym tonight. i have this schedule i'm trying to stick to, but i fucked it up today. i guess i'll just go tomorrow and make up for it, but i'm pissed at myself for crashing like that again.

since i attend a catholic university, there are masses being held all over campus, and our building is no exception. it's fun seeing all the peeps with ash on their foreheads. me, not so much.

i'm not against religion per se, it's just not for me. call me a sinner or a heathen, but i have real issues with organized religion (and christianity especially). i have this acquaintance who is devoutly christian. that's great, more power to her. but i get really fucking pissed off when she tries to make it her job to morally guide others. issue have come up before regarding cable tv, sex education, abortion, etc. and now, she's bugging me to go see the passion of the christ. i don't want to be offensive to her, but it may get to that point if she doesn't stop hounding me. i don't want to see it. at all. i have extreme issues with it. personal, religious, political, etc. nor do i want to put any money towards supporting this film. just my little opinion, but damn...STOP FUCKING BUGGING ME ABOUT IT.

*enhances calm*

so i will happily eat meat on fridays while others abstain. i will not be giving up anything for lent. i will not be attending church (like i ever do). and most importantly, i will be praying that dubya gets his sanctimonious, homophobic, lying ass kicked out of washington come november. god willing."

"event","another valentines day almost gone. i've just about eaten my weight in bad things...pizza, ice cream, snickers, goldfish, etc. i took back some shoes and an ugly jacket that i didn't want, but proceeded to spend twice that on lingerie (yes, the irony is not lost of me). talked to one of the bitches today, and she's acting really strangely. a few years ago this would've bothered me, but now i just send a big FUCK YOU into the void.

preceptor hired someone for the position i applied for. don't want to sound bitter (cause i'm really not)...but he sucks. seriously. he started lecturing me like i was five, and now thinks he's the end-all, be-all around the office. i don't like going there anymore.

so i'm job hunting again, but it's not looking good. at this point i'll take just about anything. 

did manage to get to the gym today, but that doesn't exactly cancel out all i've eaten. blech.

as this year has been hell classwise and internship wise, and my stress reaction is to eat bad things...i have a plan. and i need to be accountable to someone lest i stray back to my evil ways.

the plan is this: i will workout 3 days per week, and keep to a good diet regime. if i stray from this, y'all will hear about it in this journal, and you will proceed to let me have it. 

i'm serious about this. i know i don't have a lot of time these days, but i figure i can squeeze in 3 days per week. i'll update THE PLAN when i graduate, as i'll have more time for such pursuits.

i will not go to this damn thing looking as i did the last time they saw me. I WILL NOT. if i have to put up with crappy people, at least i can look fabulous doing it.

1) my parents will never think highly of me, no matter what i do; i need to stop trying to make them proud of me, cause it's never going to happen.

2) life is moving on without me, and i feel like i'm still in junior high.

3) i get bored very easily, which usually leads to eating, exercising too much, or surfing the internet all night.

4) my home is no longer in Portland...yet it's not in St. Louis either. basically, i'm a nomad with my trusty Civic as my steed.

5) wherever i go, i will never be able to escape old boyfriends (as i saw one at the movie theater last week...oh joy).

not me.

i study, and go to work, and watch tv, and go to the gym (although not as much as i should be, and my ass is paying for it). these days, i consider the grocery store and target an outing. hi, just call me pathetic. 

my aunt thought i was 24, because apparently i neither act nor look like i'm mature. i'm pushing 30, yet i have nothing substantial to show for it. i don't have a husband, kids, house, career, or any semblance of a social life. i don't want to be all whiny, pouty, feel sorry for me...but damn, i have nothing to show for my life. i don't even own a dvd player, for fuck's sake.

i'm not excited to go back to portland for christmas, because i'm afraid i'll run into people from high school/college, and i'll be forced to make up crap about my life just so i don't sound like a complete loser.

i've had dreams about ex the past two nights. while it's nothing new, two nights in a row is unique. i think this means something, but i have no idea what. it's really irritating me, and i wake up cranky and tired. just the presence of him in my dreams makes me sleep badly. he's still fucking up my life even after four gd years.

there may be a vegas trip with the entire fam in the spring, but i don't even want to go. everyone will have a significant other, and i'll be stuck as the 9th wheel. hanging out by myself in the middle of a casino is not my idea of a great vacation. i may just tell everyone i have too much work to do and can't make it.

i've dissected a zebra penis before...not as gross as you might think

i've had sex in six different cars, seven houses, a field, a beach, the kitchen table, and other odd places i probably shouldn't discuss (hmmm, is this TMI?)
i've eaten squirrel
i punched a guy in Mexico
a long lost relative in the late 1800's was a member of the infamous 'Dalton Gang' in the old west
i was once asked to host a morning show in Portland...i said no

of course, these fun facts all happened a long time ago. i think my life has become incredibly boring as of late. i need to spice things up a bit.

"event","i was told yesterday by one of the bitches that people on the west coast are ""lazy"". 

i'm pissed, and told her she was insulting me. 

this whole thing started because someone else said they want to live on the west coast after graduation because it's more laid back than other places (meaning the east coast). i agreed, cause it is. then the bitch says she could never live there because people are ""lazy"". it was a whole big thing, and she apologized, and i really didn't say anything. i'm still pissed.

just because i don't worry about things that are irrelevant, or get uptight or anal because i'm not sitting in class waiting for it to start a half hour before, or because i still wear flip-flops after labor day (i swear, i think she's from the 50's). 

ugh. yep, still pissed.

and she hasn't said anything to me since then. so either she knows she fucked up and feels bad, or she's pissed at me for getting pissed at her for insulting me.

"event","so i'm reading the chapters in my biostatistics book for class tomorrow, and it's a review of basic stats things like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, etc. the book is extremely technical, and i wanted a simpler review for some terms. so i google standard deviation and definition, and run across the coolest site. it's HyperDictionary.com, and it gives about six different definitions from several dictionary databases. it has english meanings, medical meanings, dream meanings, etc. 

so i start playing around with it and type in several different things, and then i type in 'sex'. it gives gender meanings, sexual meanings, etc. then i scroll down to the dream dictionary part, remembering the sex dream i'd had the other night. it says this:

""Alternatively and a more direct interpretation of the dream, may be your libido's way of telling you that it's been too long since you have had sex.""

well no shit, sherlock. ya think? although i have to say it's much more depressing actually seeing it in black and white than just thinking it.

"event","you know what irritates me? it's small, and not really all that important, but it somehow gets under my skin nonetheless. people who proof my school papers and want me to make changes that are either just plain wrong, or don't make sense. 

here's an example:

my sentence: ...has become important as of late,

her corrections: ...has become important as of recently,

now, i'm open to grammar errors on my part, but i still think i have a good grasp on the english language. to my knowledge, 'as of late', is still a valid way of saying 'recently', it's just a bit more stylized. am i wrong on this? cause i really don't think so.

another thing. the proofer doesn't want me to use contractions. everytime i put 'it's', she corrected it to 'it is'. are contractions obsolete now? are they shunned in the world of english grammar nowadays? i didn't think so, but i could be wrong. 

ugh. i really hate that."

"event","in analyzing my emotional responses today (in between reading pages of dull drivel), i've come to the conclusion that i should monitor my emtotional responses more often. 

see, i got a phone call from lori last night asking me when i wanted to get together to go over the epi homework. i said, i don't care, whenever. she said, how about tomorrow, i said cool, she said what time, i said no matter, she said how early is too early, i said no earlier than ten, she said i'll call ann and let her know that we'll do it at eleven.

another phone call from lore, saying that ann could only do it at nine because she had 'errands to run'. now, i know that ann gets up at 5:30 am every day by choice. it's fine, no big. now, when she starts mandating my schedule because she can't run 'errands' before or after study group, that pisses me off. long story short, they didn't even bother to ask me if nine would be ok, lori just said, 'ann can't do it because she has to run errands and we're meeting at nine. but if you have questions about the homework, you can call us.' great, so now i'm not even invited. wtf?

point of fact, i was up  by eight this morning. fuck them.

this really pissed me off, but it took me awhile to figure out exactly why i'm pissed. i've come to the following conclusions:

1. i get angry because ann's definitions of errands are going to the grocery store, target, etc. now, any normal human being would just go to the grocery store BEFORE the study group, then target after, or something. the fact that she decided she 'can't' run errands in that manner, then put her restrictions on the rest of us pisses me off. then, both of them made me feel as though wanting to semi-sleep in on one of the few days that i can, is wrong.

2. the fact that they intentionally left me out of the study group, without even giving me the option of being there at nine. basically just dismissing me even before i had a chance to say anything.

3. this behavior from them is what i experienced in the beginning of the program, hence me assigning the nickname 'the bitches'.

4. why even call me and ask me to come if they don't want me there in the first place?

5. both of them had already done the problems, whereas i have not had time to do them. when i asked if they were just going to review the problems or actually do them all the way through, lori said they were going to review them. now, if i haven't done the problems (which lori knew), why go through all that crap of inviting me, figuring out times, and pissing me off when it doesn't help me at all?

ugh. i'm still pissed. although, it's good to know exactly what i'm pissed about. so if they come to my desk on monday and ask me (in a knowing, whiny tone) what time i got up on saturday, and i say eight, and they ask why i didn't come, i'll know what to say. i'm going to say something along the lines of, 'well, it would've done no good anyway, seeing as how i hadn't had time to do the problems yet.'

end rant.

i need to focus on something else. like boys, or chocolate, or chocolate covered boys."

mom wants to come visit me. don't know why, but there you have it. she's not the type to come visit just because. the entire five years i was an undergrad, she only came to ashland twice. moving in as a freshman, and graduation. she's just not the 'invade your space because i miss you' type. so...i'm wondering why she wants to come. it's not like i don't want her here, i just know there's an underlying reason that she's not telling me. maybe it was my near-hysteria when my a/c broke. but, can you really blame me? it was 98 degrees in my apartment, and i hadn't slept in 38 hours. i think i'm entitled to a mini-breakdown. 

my QaF obsession is still full-throttle. i dl'd eps off kazaa, and am now burning them onto cd's. my hard drive is straining under the video i've put on it. poor michael. 

brian kinney is a fucked-up, narcissistic, commitment-phobe who's hotter than hell. i heart him muchly.

i made myself a list of crap i have to get done this weekend. it sucks. i actually have to start being productive now. meh. 

i've already started to read a book for class. it's a novel, and i figured i'd much rather get it read and out of the way before class starts, than try to read it while doing all the other crap i have to do. so, it's 3/4 way done, and everytime i read it i feel like killing myself. it's that depressing. 

when the guy was fixing my a/c, he knocked out power to the outlet in my kitchen that runs my george foreman grill and microwave. that severely limits my options for meals. it sucks. that was monday. i've called twice already, and they still haven't come to fix it. i'm getting royally pissed. but, i'd much rather have functioning a/c than a running microwave anyday. plus, i imagine they have a/c problems all over the place since it was 104 yesterday. i'll give them a break.

"event","below are e-mail correspondence with my friend in seattle. highly amusing, if you as me.

friend:
So, I'm starting my own dating strategy/attack!  I've decided that I'm going to go on 100 dates.  I'm hoping to do that by the new year but I might need to extend it to a full calendar year.  I think I just decided that I was going to treat it like a mission and go all balls out.  If I can't get a viable relationship out of that, well then there just might not be anyone out there after all.  But I'll let youknow how it goes.  So far I've only got 2 down, 98 to go.Wish me luck!

me:
BWAHAHAHAHA. 

Sounds like a plan to me. So are you keeping a dating journal? Things like names, where you went, if he picked his teeth at the table, ordered crappy beer, kissed like a fish, or had an endowment that rivaled a vienna sausage? You should totally make a website out of it: Daley's Dating Diary. Complete with descriptive pseudonym's such as Tiny Tom or Boring Bob. 

So how're you getting these dates? Are you asking them, or flirting shamelessly until they ask you out? I kinda like the idea of flirting shamelessly...more of an adventure that way. 

Here's hoping your new mission is successful. You do know, of course, that I will want all pertinent information regarding the 'targets'. I'm all about living vicariously. 

friend:
You name it and I'm doing it!  Tier 1:  set-ups, a couple so far that are impending,  Tier 2: parties, got a few under the belt and
things are shaking out from them slowly, Tier 3: websites, gives a lot of dating volume if you're brave enough for a lot of blind
dates, Tier 4: Singles events.  Heading out for an evening cruise the weekend after next, gotta be unattached to come!  Tier
5: speed dating, meet a lot of guys all in one night, but can only count towards the 100 if there is a subsequent meeting. I tell you I'm like the general of dating.  Oh, and yes, there is a dating journal.  Not very detailed yet but I see book potential ;). 
The first guy I went out with I found out was wanted by the feds as an adolescent for check forging!!! It oughta be interesting, I'll keep you updated.



so i'll keep you updated. should be an interesting endeavor, and said friend always has the best stories to tell about her dating experiences.

happy hunting."

YOU MUST WATCH QUEER AS FOLK. not only is it really funny, but there's a guy on there who is the hottest, baddest, most beautiful guy i've ever seen. i'm not kidding. i watched the dvd's three times already because i'm obsessed with him. brian kinney. 

so hot.

so everything i'd ever want in a character (although he's gay, which kind of puts a kink in wanting him for myself).

"event","after working here nearly a year, i've finally added some personal touches to my cubicle. a plant (in which the terra cotta holder broke as i was carrying it up to the school), and some pretty, girly pics of flowers in a nice black matted frame (which was a bitch to get in, and the glass drew blood in the process). it feels homier now, which is the point since i'll be spending all my free time here come august 25th. at least i'll have nice scenery while i toil away at mundane tasks all day long.

so, i've decided not to apply for the epi-CDC fellowship. i'm not one to be a quitter, but the odds of me actually getting it are slim to none, and why put in that much work for nothing? i'll apply for a few others that i found. they're much less work, and i have a greater chance of getting a spot.

don't know if i mentioned this or not, but i chopped all my hair off. it's now shoulder length, and in a surprising twist, my hair has changed textures. it now has a bit of curl at the bottom, which is good and bad. i flat-iron it most days, but i overslept this morning and it's all bouncy. can't be too bad considering i got quite a few compliments on it. it was just getting too damn hot to keep it that long.

i have brownies at home :) (of course, i don't actually NEED them. my hips are probably screaming for mercy at this point. visiting home isn't conducive to healthy eating.)

queer eye for the straight guy is one tonight!!! i can't wait.

i'm on a mission to beautify my life. not only did i cut off my hair, buy some new clothes, and dye my eyebrows and eyelashes; but i am also beautifying my cubicle (see above), and attempting to beautify my apartment. while on vacation i turned off the a/c, and subsequently my plant died. so i went to home depot yesterday and bought four new plants. i just need to get the pots today, and i'll be set. then i need to find some pictures to go above the futon. that'll be the challenging part. my futon cover is a dark blue (i realize now i should've picked taupe), and i need some color to spice it up a bit. i'll have to scour the craft shops and such. i ended up finding pics of flowers for my cubicle at whole foods market. greeting cards. who would've thought?

ok, back to the horrifying statistical program now. why are there statistics? why do we need them? is it absolutely necessary?"

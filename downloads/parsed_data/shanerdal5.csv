"event","I was watching Conan tonight, probably a rerun, but he went to a blues bar in Chicago and hung with the owner.  The owner was showing off guitars...the first one was named Lola or something.  The second one, though...Tanya.  I have never felt so many memories rush back to me at once, all stemming from the time that I helped name Kevin's guitar, Tanya.  I remembered a lot of good times and how I have always felt that our worlds have done everything in their power to keep us from REALLY connecting and being really good friends.  Every time we hang out, it's just like we share a lot of the same views on life.  I have a female best friend, but when I need a male's perspective on what to do, he has always cared enough to give me an honest answer but ultimately saying, ""Don't worry man, things will work out.""  I worry a lot at random times, and Kevin has always been a rock during even the petty times.

I am moving to Chicago soon.  I have not bothered to even try to date or try to make friends for the summer, because it doesn't seem to matter when I'm leaving it all behind soon.  In fact, I have thought that there is not even a point to keeping in touch with friends when I am not very likely to ever see them often, if ever again.

But then I remember Tanya.

And I hope that somehow, as life works in mysterious ways, the distance is the exact thing I need to keep such a great person around in my life.  Because there haven't been many friendships that have stuck out in my mind like Kevin's.  It's much, much less than romance (sorry Kevin), but, well, I love ya man."

"event","I would just like to point out that I was so close to responding to a sexy e-mail I have just received, with the subject heading ""HusbandAwayLonly.""  YES!!  I have been waiting years for husband to be away...oh but women who can't spell turn me off.  I'm sorry, the correct answer was ""HusbandAwayLonely.""  I have no clue how I am getting these e-mails.  Maybe it was when I ordered College Girls Gone Wild 83 or else it could have been that night I logged onto www.MILFJUICE.com and it said ""enter e-mail as password for free access.""  What a scam!  Those girls were way too young and hot to be moms.  Damn.

Seriously, I may have to drop the e-mail address and start over because I can't take anymore solicitations.  Plus I am irritated that I finally made it to my first Tiger game of the year and they get shut out for the first time this season at home.  And it was 90 degrees and sweltering, which literally almost killed my grandma.  She was shaky walking to the bathroom and we had to get a wheelchair to wheel her out!!  That really scared me.  I came to the realization that that was her last Tiger game.  She never looks out for herself, Miss Independent and 92 years old.  Anyway, it was still a fun day with the family for sure, but just a little scary and sad, too!

I'm bored and lonely this summer, but it will only make the transition to Chicago much easier because I'll DEFINITELY be ready to get out of Kalamazoo.  I still hope I meet a great girl before I leave, but if I don't, I'm not going to be worried.  I'm turning into much more of a loner than I ever thought was possible for me...I guess it's a good thing but I do find myself jealous of every relationship ever and just hope it really does still happen someday.  But it really is ok that it's not happening right now.  Not here.  Not SLUTamazoo.  Out of the millions of people in Chicago, there has to be one nice, smart GIRL who doesn't think I'm gay, is accepting of one's religious beliefs, and who is actually looking for a real relationship with a nice guy and isn't looking to get banged as a top priority.  If her goal is also to be an optometrist, that would be wonderful.  It's not a must, but I don't know where she would be otherwise because I fear that I will never leave the grounds of ICO.  Anyway, career is more important than my hunt for this woman, although it'd be a really nice way to relieve stress (oh yeah and I guess it would probably be nice to love somebody again...I'm not sure I'm still capable of loving.  It's been so long!).  hahaha.  Anyway, that's all for now...probably for a LONG time.  Like the last time.  PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST"

"event","Do you ever just have those days when all the little things seem to be going your way?  Not the big things, like you won the lottery or you didn't study and still aced your pharmacology exam.  Today the sun was out, all the good songs on my walk to class were playing on my mp3 player, and I hit all green lights everywhere that I drove today.  It's crazy how hitting green lights vs. red can change your mood so much.  Of course, it does kind of make sense in the fact that green is supposed to be a very relaxing color, whereas red is more violent and ferocious.  But thanks to all green lights while looking for some place to get carryout, I decided to treat myself to a nice meal from Applebee's because it was such a good day, and tipped the girl who took my order $10 because I was feeling nice.  I ordered way too much food and actually ate it all!  And I was really not looking forward to throwing an entire presentation together tonight, but I worked hard and it went really smoothly.  When one T.V. show would go to commercial, I'd change the channel, and the second I changed the channel BACK, the show came back on.  I just avoided all those little annoyances today.

On a similar note, all of my farts smell like petunias and when I spit out my toothpaste, my mucous was in the shape of a heart!  Ok I'm kidding, but it was quite a refreshing day!  I got my one day for the year.  The next time I get good news, I expect to be stopped at a red light."

"event","I apologize for the last entry.  Some of you may have felt attacked, but it wasn't intended to be that way at ALL.  I was refuting certain viewpoints and I get a little passionate talking about certain things when I see a lot of people so closed-minded on issues.  But I'd like to clear one thing up for you...I BELIEVE IN GOD.  He's sitting up there and laughing at me because what I wrote probably seems a little ridiculous to Him, but I'll bet he also sees that I've broken through on a couple of ideas, too.

As for refuting creationism.  I didn't mean to say that was the only reason people believe in it!  I was mostly giving a reason as to why some people close their minds off to evolution.  As I have believed for quite some time and was reiterated in a recent discussion, they both probably occured.  Simple forms of life were created by God...then they evolved.

Another thing, I know that there are a LOT of reasons why people believe what they do and for why they attend church.  I wasn't saying that all people who go to church are afraid and only trying to get into Heaven.  I was just saying, the people that do need to re-evaluate their intentions.  All I was saying is make sure that if you choose to go to church, it is because you have chosen to solely because you feel it right in your heart.

No one should have felt attacked.  I am just trying to solve the problems of the world.  Please don't assume I'm a Christian hater because, even after rereading the entry, I still didn't see where I attacked Christians.  I put a warning up, so you can choose not to read it, but please don't take offense.  I love all Gods and all of their children.  And everyone else with no God/Gods.  There, I think I saved my ass.

"event","I just found out some pretty exciting news.  They are coming out with a Curious George movie, and JACK JOHNSON is doing the soundtrack.  He's coming out with a CD of lullabys and sing-a-longs with some ""friends"" meaning ben harper, probably G Love and Special Sauce and some other really great artists.  Jack Johnson is by far the most talented artist of the time...between the lyrics, tunes, and overall combination to convey some really great messages of things that were lost in this world long ago.  He lightly attacks the media, war, and many other issues without smoking weed, yet in a non-violent way.  It's incredible.  Plus, his songs seem to really display what love really is like, something that every pop artist confuses with a 14 year old crush.


So I thought today was pretty fitting to begin writing in here again, since I left off with Valentine's Day and love or whatever.  Today is the date that I asked out my first girlfriend.  That's a fun fact.  I don't think my thoughts have changed on love since a year ago.  I really haven't dated anyone since before then.  I'd like to get all depressed at this time, but I can't.  I don't care.  I can't wait to find love, but come on...it's not like I've found anything worth giving a shot recently.  

I'm sorry if I seem like I'm being picky, and I apologize to anyone who has tried to get something to work, but any obvious chance I've had has contained major flaws.  I was going to cite specific examples, but to save the character of certain individuals I won't.  I'd just like to say, though, that even though somehow this saucy stud managed to stay a virgin this long, doesn't mean you have to be one to get a date.  haha  Just as long as you were in love or at least thought you were when it happened.  No random hookups allowed.  Also, don't do drugs.  To quote Saved By The Bell: ""There's no hope with dope!""

Another thing, there will come a time when I do believe age won't matter.  But right now, I see a huge difference in maturity between most freshmen and seniors, like me.  Granted there are exceptions, but if you are interested, make sure you're not a minor at the very least.

*****WARNING: You may be upset by the following content.  Please understand that I am not attacking a certain religion, but rather just stating my thoughts in relation to people who refuse to have an open mind.  I understand that there are many interpretations of the Bible and many ways in which your religion may differ from the ideas that I refute.  My ideas may seem harsh only because I held them in for too long, making me feel extra-passionate.  My opinions are subject to change, especially if you would like to discuss a certain issue further.  I will listen because other viewpoints give me more insight and knowledge.  And KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!!!***

Next I'd kind of like to discuss religion a little bit.  I was tackling the issue of evolution vs. creationism in a class, and it hit me.  I was thinking about the Bible and how it could not possibly hold all of the answers.  And I think the main reason that people insist that creationism is still correct, besides the fact that they may be uneducated, is because if one part of the Bible is proven false, that means other parts may be false, too.  SCARY.  This seems to be a nice text to provide a skeleton of a moral outline on how to live your life, or at least improve yourself.  But that's all it is; a self-help book.  I think I feel like I'm attacking the Holy Book, but I need to let these thoughts out.  It is just ridiculous that people's actions are manipulated by this book, merely because this is how Jesus lived.  No one can be Jesus. I love Frank Sinatra but I don't go around calling broads dames and trying to act like a gangster (old school, not gangsta).  In the music world, I believe him to be God.  And for all the racists in the South...JESUS WASN'T WHITE.  During His second coming, he won't be white then, either.  

Oh, and Adam and Eve?  What the hell?  Yeah, the world began with two white people and somehow dark black people in Africa evolved from them.  And as these Africans mixed with other races, which also decended from two whites, the next generations became lighter in color.  Makes sense to anyone who has never colored with a black or a white crayon.  Oh, or does this help explain why only whites are humans?

Basically what I'm saying is that I am sick of all this ignorance in this world.  With all the excellent education in our country, do you know how so many people stay ignorant?  They come in to the schools with pre-conceived opinions about many serious issues, because of parenting.  Parents pass their ignorant ideas to their children, who will believe everything their parents say until they experience life for themselves.  But when they come out of their all-white community and meet a black HUMAN for the first time, they already know so much about their culture, thanks to their parents.  So they believe that other races are dangerous and slow.  FIGHT CONSERVATISM.

By the way, one small thought I've been thinking about for all the strictly religious, pro-life supporters.  If sex was only intended for making babies, then why were humans designed to feel good during the act?  It could have very well been designed to be painful (not just the women going through labor, but maybe men could feel something 8x the pain of having their balls in a vice) which would DEFINITELY ensure that not only would all children be wanted but also that the world would take much longer to become overpopulated.  So then why does sex feel so good when its main purpose is for babies?  Why is it a ""basic human instinct?""  Because long ago, the church didn't want people to feel good.  Sex felt good, so it was deemed a sin.  This created desire in the human race to perform acts that were wrong, especially when there was not much potential for physical harm to many other humans; at least in the way of pain (minus labor pains).  But it's an instinct because it was intended to be desired in the first place; to feel good.  Humans deserve pleasure...we endure enough pain via other routes in our life.  I'm definitely not strictly pro-choice either.  You have to be reasonable.  Having sex means you know the risks going into it.  CAUTION: PENETRATION MAY CAUSE AN IRREVERSIBLE LIFE TO OCCUR.  Issues like rape and the health of the mother are a few acceptable justifications for an abortion.

All I'm saying is that, although I have limited knowledge of the Bible, I really think it should be left for interpretation of the individual.  Who is to say that one interpretation is right or wrong?  Basically, everything in life is ambiguous.  I believe that includes sexuality.  For instance, as much as I'd like to deny it, I am able to tell you if another male is attractive or unattractive.  Based on my own experiences, I'm most likely not going to be attracted to this male myself...but I think the mere fact that we can all recognize when a human being is attractive is a form of sexuality.  But, I will continue to declare that I am a heterosexual male because I have not yet desired to be with a man.  I intend to fall in love and marry a woman, and because of this fact I am currently a heterosexual.

My thoughts are like my own personal Bible...a Bible left to your interpretation.  Think of me what you will.  I am open to any debate.  Just don't attack me as an individual and I won't attack you (since I'm sure anyone who reads this is convinced I'm a man-lover because my thoughts just went against the norm.  I MUST love men.)

Wow this ended up to be really long.  Finally, I would like to say that a lot of religion is fear-based.  I was upset with something I read in someone's profile.  I believe it said, ""I'd rather live my life believing that there's a God and die to find out there isn't, then to live my life as if there isn't a God and die to find out there is.""  There are different ways of interpreting this, but I'm going to use it to prove this point of religion being fear-based.  People disguise fear as faith.  Many people get scared into going to church by others.  The combination of people's fear of pain and the possibility that there is life after death leads many to going to church and saying they believe...simply because they live by that quote above.  I realize the quote also says ""it's nice to have faith in something, and that is gratification enough for me, even if it ends up not being true.""  But it also indicates a selfishness in many people that they are so afraid of the consequences and that so many others share these beliefs, that they don't want to be in pain or be left out (causing more pain) after death.

The thing is, we were all created by God (or whoever else) to have opinions.  Going throughout life, we are encouraged to stand up to our parents, stand up to our bosses, stand up for what you believe in, stand up for what's right.  Well why the hell can't people stand up to God?  You're allowed to say, ""Hey, God, this part your people wrote here on page 1058 of the Bible...I don't agree.""  And do you know what God would say?  ""That's ok.  Your courage will be rewarded.""  ...in HELL YOU SINNER!  NEVER QUESTION ME OR MY TEXT AGAIN!!!  Seriously, all I'm saying is that if people question some part of a religion, that is OK.  We're supposed to question things and find our own way...which makes whatever WE decide to believe in so much more gratifying.

That was SO LONG if anyone is still reading this, you're nuts.  I'm just letting everything out that I've suppressed this past year.  Now I feel better.  Later."

"event","I have just realized that after the last girl I ""dated"" or started anything with...I have lost faith in women.  Why should I waste time on someone who makes me feel wonderful one day and terrible the next?  Because that one good day may be the last chance I get or because I need to be reminded every once in a while of how great love can be?  I will never forget how great love can be already.  All this experience has reminded me of is how selfish one can be and how blind people are, also.

I think this scares me a lot for one odd reason: for the first time in my life, there is no emptiness because I have no one to love.  I'm happy with my life and there is no girl in it.  I still consider myself a romantic and if I found a girl to love, I would love her the best that I possibly could.  But the fact that I'm not looking and I don't care whether I meet this girl tomorrow or in 5 years is just new to me.  I will probably always fear that we never cross paths or that we already have and I've lost her forever.  (assuming there is only 1 person for all of us)  I would love to be fortunate enough to give life to a human being, and to give this person a good life at that.  I know the world would be a better place if that were possible because I truly care.

But I know that life is not always fair.  Could it be that the world might be better if I go through life alone?  I've considered that possibility, which scares me somewhat.  I guess that would be ok, if that's what was intended for me, but I guess more than anything I'd like to know so I can prepare myself.  But I guess that would not be fair to everyone else if only I got to know...we all must go through many things unprepared...like I've done for many tests in college so far!  I seem to pass them all, somehow, so that must be a good sign.

I just watched ""The Notebook"" with Kevin, which just got me to thinking!  At one time, I would have felt that the ending was right.  Now I have a new view, and that hit me tonight.  I would care for her just the same as he, but I wouldn't feel the need to dedicate my life to trying to make her remember.  She is what she is and I wouldn't try to bring her back to the past...but just make the present better and easier for her.  That's what I could bring to her.  And that would be enough.  I do miss being in love, and since it's Valentine's Day now I guess I should just say...I feel the same as every other day of the year.  And that's ok.  It's just a first in my life.  I was just unprepared...but here it is.  And it will pass just the same and I have nothing to be sad about!  Just a new appreciation for life."

Thoughts just fly through my head too quickly to write down.  So instead of writing, I just sit, stare, and ponder for a few minutes...and it seems to help.  

I just spent way too long studying and I never thought I'd freak out about this biomedical ethics exam but I'm sure it'll turn out ok!  Sometimes I feel like the dumbest kid in my classes these days and it scares me.  It makes me wonder if I'm going to succeed.  Some nights I find that I have no motivation...like I've spent too long taking classes that aren't getting me anywhere.  I'm just eager to go out and make a difference in peoples' lives.  I'd like to think that I can make a difference...but I can, even if it's only to my own kids.  That's what I ultimately want to do is help people, be a good husband, and be a good dad...when those opportunities arise.  I feel like everyone around me is advancing in their goals and I am standing still.  I just want to be the best and I'm afraid of failure.  But one thing is, if I fail, I'm more likely get it right the next time around.  And there can always be a next time...somehow...and there WILL be.  I can make sure of that much.  It's just hard to fail sometimes, but honestly even in the medical field...YES, failure is an option that improves you overall as a person.  Most people don't realize this concept and can't accept it.

And that in turn frustrates me as well:)  But frustration is healthy, as long as you are able to sleep it off.  Sometimes it indicates that you care a lot about something.  Girlfriends used to frustrate me all the time...but only because I cared about them! :)  hahaha."

"event","Well I'm just winding down from work tonight.  I'm kind of angry that I have to work so much this weekend because there is stuff going on that I'd really like to go to.  But finally when I get invited to parties, I have to work.  One nice thing, though, is that on saturday I get to work with Kevin for over an hour!  First time ever and since it's a saturday night there should be plenty of ladies to check out.  And all the hot ones (and by hot, I mean slutty.  Hot at SNS = nice cleavage with belly button exposure.  Most likely wasted and puking...very attractive!) will be smoking.  All the real decent girls only come in with guys so I just go back to the service station and drool over them like a pervert.

In reality, I am actually kind of enjoying having ""prospects"" even if it just ends up being some girl in my class that I sat by 1 time.  It's still a reason to get excited and the fact that there is more than one ""prospect"" makes me feel like a player.  Like it's MY choice, not yours.  It's fun to have more than one girl on my mind.

But then there are nights like these when I'm ready to narrow it down and just get to know someone.  Instead of just saying ""yeah, I sat next to the hot girl in my class!"" and I almost talk to her. and when I say hot outside of steak n shake, it means she's got brains as well.  The good heart is yet to be determined (meaning whether or not she pursues me romantically.  haha).  So, basically what I'm saying is that a lot higher percentage of girls have been catching my interest than usual.  One may think I'm just finally lowering my standards, but that's just a joke because that will never happen!  They don't get much lower.  haha.  But seriously, I think it's an opportunity.  I've been waiting for a cute, nice girl to come along...one that WON'T use me...and all of a sudden 10 come along in the matter of a week.  This is a sign that is telling me ""hey, don't give up.  there are tons of dateable girls out there looking for more than a good time ... you just need to get the balls to start asking them out""

I've always been cautious in waiting until I know a girl is interested before asking her out.  That way, I don't get shot down and the pride doesn't weaken.  But seriously, if I find a girl I'm interested in...I'm going for it.  I'm ready to accept the fact that rejection is ok.  I don't want to date every girl that comes along, which is a form of rejection.  If I am rejecting them, they can reject me.  We should be given equal opportunities to reject each other.  I am not doing my part.  Most people date in hopes of finding someone to marry.  We don't think marriage right from the beginning but deep down the thought is there.  So, if there's a chance I'm going to marry this girl...how do I expect to ask her to marry me if I can't even ask her out on a casual DATE?!

Preferably twins.  Hot twins.  One tall twin and one short twin.  And both of the twins will have nice...twins.  I also just got off the phone after a random 20 minute conversation with Cassy. She had been drinking a bit, but she had invited me to come over earlier but I didn't.  We realized we are working together in the morning!  She asked me to call her when I woke up so I could wake her up from her drunken slumber.  I jokingly said ""you know, it'd be easier if I just nudged you"" so then she invited me to come over to her house and just spent the night with her.  That turned me on big time so I politely declined, and she agreed that she is sick of coming across to people as a slut because she is not!  So we had a nice talk besides that and I will see her tomorrow!  Then when I'm done with work at 3, it's off to the mall with Kevin.  I'm really excited for this because I miss going to the mall or the casino with the guys to check out girls.  It's a good bonding moment.  Haha.

She amazes me and sometimes has to hold ME together because I am not used to having someone to worry about like this.  I may not be a religious man, but I have to say that I pray for the both of them almost daily because they both deserve the best and I want to be the one to give it to them.  I won't be, but I'll do whatever I can to help their lives be a success!  Anyway, I won't be seeing much of Amanda the next few weeks but it will be worth it because I know she will be right where she wishes she could be every day of the year rather than just 2 weeks.  True love for a friend doesn't always mean ""being there""...sometimes it just means getting away and giving them some space every now and then.  We all need a little time to ourselves every once in a while and if we don't get it, we can easily go crazy!  It's just that sometimes we get so caught up in wishing we had more time to ourselves that we don't think to try to give that same time to others, too!

This journal was a good idea.  Sometimes these late-night observations need to be let out to anyone or anything before your mind can relax and begin to shut down (aka SLEEP).  I think I have needed this for a long time and it's nice to know that all my friends now have another way of attempting to understand what goes through my mind."

"event","Fuck this bad weather!  I tried to answer my cell phone on the walk home, but my hand was so cold I couldn't hold onto the phone.  So I dropped it in a HUGE puddle and now my phone is dead!  Looks like I'll be getting a new phone tomorrow...as well as a new number.

And now I'm working tonight.  And I'm really sick.  Yay.

Good thing no one can call me because this day sucks so bad you probably don't want to talk to me anyway!  Hahaha!

I'm really not in that bad of a mood but sometimes you've got to complain:)

So I am ready to spend whatever cash it takes to fix my computer.  It's slower than a 1996 Gateway computer on a modem!

So keep reading, so you can get my new phone number because my phone is definitely flooded and dead!  This means I have most likely lost your number as well so you should call my new number when I post it so I can have yours too!  Damn I know I lost a lot of really hot girls numbers, who (trust me) will never be calling ME again!  BOO! :)

Yet I'm still smiling because I DO get to work with Amanda tonight, I've been meaning to get a new cell phone ANYWAY (just not a number change and loss of my personal phone book), now i'll get to have a local area code!, and everyone's computer is fucked up in some way so why should I bitch anymore than the rest?  Okay, so now I'm not so angry about tonight!  Just blowing off a little steam."

"event","new year's is a lot like puberty:  balls drop and changes occur.

It is an indication that we all must try to let go of our past and focus on the present.  

These changes force us to make the transition from I was happy to I am happy.  But until that transition occurs, it is impossible to move on to better things.  And trust me...they are waiting for you.  Until then, you have friends to look out for you.  The good ones will, and even though life may have been easier with ""her"" in it...we've all been there.  Some of us still are, some are not.  I, too, have felt broken hearted in the same way you have.  You're not the first to experience the struggle, and you should not let yourself be the last to realize this and to dwell on it.

Remember that the end of one relationship is not the end of them all.  Sometimes you have to realize that you are just between relationships, rather than past a good one, or even what you think may have been the one.  Experience may be the only way to find out for sure.

And who knows...you could stumble across the REAL ""one""...if you found yourself unable to believe that anyone could be that good, there could be someone out there even better.  You just can't believe it yet...because you don't want to."

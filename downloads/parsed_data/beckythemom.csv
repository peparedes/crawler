Last year in October, my nephew Colton was born. In December, we were attending his funeral. This was to be the first of nearly a dozen funerals we'd attend over the next few months. I won't lie. All the death, the sadness, but especially the first.. there are still days when I fight depression. However, getting a dog has been a tremendous help.

Yeah, I remember that in my last journal I said I'm allergic to all things furry. This didn't really matter much when I went to take pictures of golden retriever puppies, and the one I picked up flopped onto my shoulder with a content sigh. She just turned six months old and was better therapy than all the pills doctors tried shoving at me. (I flushed most of the pills without taking them. Seriously... I'm just not a fan not to mention after taking the pills for two days I was too sick to stand up, and worse physically than I was emotionally. How that was making me better, I haven't a clue.) Anyway, her name is Ginger. She has half an extra foot and a cleft nose, and is the cutest dog ever. We've yet to meet someone who didn't agree that she's adorable. However, it's not like she gives people much of a choice. She's friendly, and knows no strangers.

A feral cat dropped five kittens on us, and then took off. Awesome neighbors took two of them, and we kept the other three. Even with the allergy medicine, they make me sneeze and itch. However, they're cute and the boys are set on them staying. Their names are Tyler, Scarlett, and Miney (aka Duncan).

We replaced a critter when Dot passed away this past spring. The new fella is a red-eyed hamster named Squeak. He's not as social as Dot was, but he was much younger and handled way less. *shakefist Petco* He has a good life here, though. Huge cage, lots of toys, lots of snacks, but most importantly -- lots of love.

I'm still in the same game as last time. Slightly more invested now. Wonderful adventures that are a nice mental escape from real life.

The older son was invited on a DC trip. Again we agreed that his stamina/maturity just weren't in it. However, the other trip to Europe for next year is looking like a real possibility. I'm terrified to let him go that far alone. He'll only be twelve! But it's such a fantastic opportunity for him. We'll see what happens.

I quit going to the gym around the time that my nephew died. It made no sense to try to work out if I couldn't stop crying. The fireman probably put it best when he called his boss the day we found out to explain why he wouldn't be into work for a few days and said, ""She's a mess."" That was quite an understatement in itself, though.

I started knitting again. Things aren't so bad. A lot of people have it a lot worse, and I am thankful every day for the things I do have.

Okay, back to drawing dogs for me.
Talk to you all next year, or something."

That's not far away from now. I'm doing this for multiple reasons and there's nothing anyone can do or say to change my feelings about this. This day will be very eventful. A burial of a life and a celebration of another. My best friend of so many years, Debbie, will be celebrating her end to her final year of teen years. She will be 20. I'm so proud of all her achievements in such a short period of time. Actually, i'm just plainly proud of her. Without her, i wouldn't be who i am today. She gives me strength to deal with the day-to-day drama, she makes me feel safe when i'm afraid of whatever may happening in my life, she gives me all my range of emotions. This is why i chose that day. I feel she must be apart of my death.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Blake. I'm only 8 months younger than Debbie but honestly sometimes i feel i'm so much older. That's the way we are together. We can be confused for mature adults or ignorant children. Either way, we are always happy with eachother. I'm openly and undeniably homosexual. Debbie on the other hand is a little more confusing. One day she bitches about her guys and really craves the attention of almost any female that walks by and then other days she forgets that she ever had those feelings. I think this is why she feels a little misplaced in this world. She can't place herself. I still love her though and nothing will change that. To go off into a little wave of memories, I remember when she was ""with"" this girl. Ashes is what we called her. That name fit her well because she burned both Debbie and I. She was a wicked creature. Ashes was the kind of person that would&nbsp;just look at you and you felt you must give her the world without question and then she'd smack you down because it wasn't good enough. She knew how to play the world and how to destroy an innocent life without ever lifting a finger. She had so many peons working for her and sadly Debbie and I were too blinded by whatever she had to wake up and stop her. Now we've grown up&nbsp;and know to wear our sunscreen.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, life's been kind of a game with us. If we have time we'll go out and try to party but most places refuse us and most people just don't like us together because we engorge eachothers attention as if we are friends that haven't seen eachother for years and years. Other than that, we live normal dramatic lives. Her parents haven't been together for years and her mother and step-father&nbsp;seperated not too long ago. Now her mother lives across the country and honestly there's not much hope of them seeing either one for quite a while. At times i think Deb is happy with this which is ironic because I live with my parents and sometimes wish they did live across country. Anyway, Deb lacking in a home moved in with her step-father who would rather look at pornographic material and make sexual comments or guestures to a 19 year old than attempt to get a female companion. This is why Deb is rarely at home. My excuse is a little different.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I said, i live at home with my parents. I have an older brother but no one really sees him much. He's kind of like me, either not home or locked up in his room playing video games or doing whatever he does with his friends. Not trying to make that sexual at all because he is straight and i haven't seen a female come into this house in a long time. I know this is turning into a gay thing but seriously, he isn't. Well, everyone but myself has a drug problem. It's not really a BAD problem, but it's horrible to me. They smoke weed like i smoke cigarettes. And personally, no one has room to complain or bitch&nbsp; about it other than me, i live with them not by choice but by lack of resources to get the hell out of here. So, i'm rarely home because i hate how they act and i hate the smell of it. What i really hate most is when i'm going to leave i have to put on 10 pounds of perfume and sprays just so i don't smell like it. Ugh, what a waste of good perfume.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love Britney Spears.&nbsp; She is my favorite pop star. I love her music, her style, her attitude, etc. Unlike most gays, i'm not really attracted to cher or madonna. I found someone so much better. Also, i'm a walking, talking, breathing discography. I have a huge list of bands, artists, songs, albums, and other information on the pop music industry in my head alone. This doesn't include what i've got on my computers, my cds, or written down somewhere. Go ahead, ask me anything about current pop industry and i can answer it. If i can't, i will money back guarentee find the answer within 24 hours. Ok so what if no one paid me to do it and if you didn't pay me then you get no money back if i'm wrong, it's the idea that counts right?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My current love is actually one of my previous ones too. We've known eachother for about 2 years now. Whether or not we've been talking is the question. Well, just recently he came to visit me and we jumped back into the relationship blindly. I'm not shunning the idea what-so-ever. I just think we should have talked a little more. Anyway, i haven't heard his voice in about two days and it's driving me insane. I want to go see him so bad but he's at work i'm sure. I miss him so much. Oh, his name is Jeff. I forgot to inform you becuase when i get into part of my boyfriend and exboyfriends and exgirlfriends, it's going to get pretty confusing. Yes, i did say exgirlfriends, but that's another story.</p>"

"event","I've felt many losses in my life time but none as painful as this. I lost something in my life that meant more to me than anything. I lost a part of my family. She wasn't a very big part, but she did play a big part in all our lives. It tears me apart just to write this, but i feel like it might help to tell her story. On December 7th, 2005 at 8:31 pm My dog, my pet, and my friend died. We all knew she wasn't going to make it; i just hoped she would have made just one more Christmas with us.
<br>
<br>
Ivana spent most of her life with us. I'm glad that we could make her happy. I don't even know how old she was. That doesn't matter now though. Now she is infinite, she has no age, and no pain. I miss her so much. The only thing i have to remember her is memories; we all know memories stay with us forever but fade away. I don't want her to fade away again. I had to watch it to begin with and i don't want to lose her. 
<br>
<br>
I want her back. Death just isn't fair. YOu can't stop it, you can't control it, and you can't predict it. I hate it so much. I hate love. I wouldn't hurt so much if i didn't love. I guess i'm just mad at myself for letting this hurt so much. I'm trying so hard to not cry right now, but that seems to be all i can do. I can't sleep, barely eat, can't go anywhere. I'm too upset. I want my friend back. I didn't even get to say goodbye. I was gone the whole day and didn't even say goodbye. I'd be happier to know that knew i still loved her, and i was there for her. This is the best for her. She deserves to be at rest then suffering for my selfishness. I'm just sorry i didn't say goodbye. 
<br>
<br>
Ivana Marie Trump, This is my goodbye. I Love You. I'm sorry....Goodbye.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ivana Marie Trump
<br>
A great pet but a greater friend
<br>
Forever Missed
<br>
Miss. E."

I just need someone to listen to me while i rant about my life. I want
people to understand that i'm not being a bitch for no reason. I just need someone to listen to me while i rant about my life. I want to release these feelings i'm trapping inside myself.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My life seems to be falling apart and being put back
together with superglue. You know what i mean, it's kinda like you want
to make a vase you just broke water proof but the glue won't seal.
Yeah, that's my life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mother of mine happened to conviently had enough
income and financing to buy herself a brand new 2005 Neon. You don't
know how upset i am about this. I am the one who needs the new car. I'm
still driving a broke down piece of shit 89 Civic. I can't even venture
out to see the one friend that means more to me than dear life because
of this car. You have no clue how much that is hurting me right now.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm failing school because i can't survive the
torment i put myself through. I'm failing school because i can't
survive the torment other students put me through. I'm failing school
because i can't survive the torment my father puts me through telling
me i'm a failure, to give up, it's not work it, i'll never amount to
anything but a diseased whore! That hurts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smoke more, concentrate less, and care about
nothing now. I used to think that i should push myself to make fake
smiles and wear them proud. That's too much work now.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Jenny was sweet, she always smiled for the people she meet""<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just need someone to listen to me as I express my
emotions. I just need...well, i just need debbie. She may only be about
30 minutes from me, but damn it right now she's on the moon. Kind of
like, i can see her, but can't get at all close enough to her. I'm 18
years old, an adult and yet i'm still a child in many aspects. I still
want someone to take care of me. I don't want to work my ass off to
make ends meet. I want things to go right in my life. I want it to be
like in 10th grade when every morning debbie would show up and wake me
up. Out the door we went to school. Then we'd be together talking for
about an hour before school. After school we would hang out again. It
was great because there wasn't a moment that when i turned around with
a tear in my eye she wasn't there holding a tissue. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just need someone to listen to me as I walk down
memory lane. I'm terrified to walk alone because there are so many pot
holes i'll trip on and hit the ground. I don't want to scrape my knee
mommy. It makes it hurt and the red stuff comes out. I don't like
boo-boos! I just want a band-aid. Do they make band-aids for the
boo-boos you get when you are completely falling apart? Do they make
band-aids for the boo-boos you get when you miss your best friend in
the world, the one person who can look at you, smile and everything is
ok again? Yeah, it's called a working car, gas, and money.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wish i had someone to listen to me.<br>

<P>Anyway, I've been at Mark's for about a weekish. Occasionally going home for a few more outfits and some cigarettes but other than that, i've been here. I've got to get a job so if you know any place that's hiring...TELL ME!!</P>
<P>Like i was saying, me and Mark have recently hooked up and we're both kinda iffy about the whole thing. Just to inform you'll, he has 8 ""arrots"".&nbsp; he has 4 parrots and 4 ferretts. They are amusing. Well, debbie started smoking in hope to get us smokers to quit. I guess that's really sweet, kinda like one of those if you die i'll die situations but this is more like, if you smoke i'll smoke with you, that's how much i'm in love with you. hee hee.</P>
<P>So, his computer is really freaking slow...i miss cable modems. : (. And he uses AOL which is a big no no in the internet world because at any given moment just because you aren't pretty enough, they can kick you off line. Ok, so they dont' know what we look like but still.</P>
<P>OH....OH...by the way, sometime soon i will performing at a club called Wet in D.C. That should be fun...it's one of those clothing optional bars so yeah, you should come out and see me and help me win cause the winner gets money which i greatly need.</P>
<P>I'm also thinking about this website that basically is nothing but a live webcam porn site but the cool thing is that i choose who i do anything with.&nbsp; well mark came home so i gotta pretend i wasn't doing anything...bye!!!</P>"

"event","Looking back at my life and watching the shit fly by just made things
even worse. Watching people come and go and then getting to the
present. Only a handful actually stuck around through the fuck ups, the
shit, the drama, the changes. I owe my life to those few. Day by day i
watch those few slowly drift in their own lives and away from mine. The
razor coming closer and close to being used everyday but i force myself
not to.<br>
<br>
I got another speeding ticket a few days ago, trying to help juleah out
and give her and her friends a ride to the beach. I had a miserable
time. The sunrise was beautiful but that was the only thing that was
good. <br>
So now i'm worried about court. I've gotta go June 22, and the 23 and now July 15th. I""m so fucked.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow is Monday, depending on how i feel, i might go out and look
for a job. I gotta get one. Time for me to grow up. I'm not ready at
all. Deb keeps telling me that my actions are usually immature, but
when you get to know me and hear me talk, she says i'm more mature than
most people. Ya know, i kinda do that purpose...I'm not ready to grow
up at all, so i figure if act stupid and do dumb things, people won't
expect me to grow up. They'll keep looking at me like i'm 16 and they
have to rely on someone else. <br>"

makes her happy, that's all that really matters. I can't really say
much about him. Tomorrow we're supposed to contront ashes, if she's
working. I've been sitting here debating on what i'm going to do with
my life. So far, nothing. I need to grow up so bad but i'm just not
ready to. I have to get a job, fix my car, move out, get a lover, pay
bills, and i'm just not ready. I wanna be a kid still. I still want to
live for free. I want to go out to the club every weekend and not have
to worry about gas and getting in and food and drinks. I want to be
able to drive anywhere i want and not have to worry about will i break
down. I just don't want to worry anymore. I don't wanna worry about
money, my friends, my family, myself, and anything else that crosses my
path.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to go out and have fun. I don't want to work
all the time and come home to sit in my bed alone, watch tv, then sleep
and repeat the next day. I wanna be able to sleep in late and do
whatever. I'm tired of trying ot deal with everyone elses problems too.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm tired of worrying about when i'm supposed to
take juleah to get her learners, when i'm supposed to get a job, when
my car's going to break down, when debbie's going to need my help to
make her stop crying. I love my friends to death and it's hard on them
being friends with me i know. Because one moment i just need time to
myself but that same moment i want them around. I dont'&nbsp; even know
how to put that. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are few that i'll put life on the line to help
them. Actually there's one. Debbie. She's my life. I'm scared of
growing up for the most part that i might loose the most valuable
things in my life. Because i'll be too tired or busy with work. I just
can't handle this right now. Now isn't the time i need to drop out of
school, have my car break down, have my parents steal my money, have
drugs around me at all times, not be able to see debbie when i need
her, have juleah need me to fix her god damned problems, to hear from
ashes, to listen to jo-joe talk about absolutely nothing, to have to
worry about whether or not i have to kicks his ass out of my house. I
don't need all this now. I need Debbie to tell me to do. She has no
idea though, and i know this. She can't help me. As much as i love her
for trying but this is too much for her and myself to handle. I must
force myself to do this on my own, i just hope she can be there to
catch me because i know i'm going to fall. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been smoking like crazy to pause the tension
and stress of all this. I'm trying not to cut. I think i'll just pierce

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you tried closing your eyes and trying to
understand what someone means when they say ""when the wind blows, the
world has moved just that much more away from you"". Yeah, i don't get
it either. ::shrugs::<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been told all my life that i wasn't going to
make it. I believed them. Then someone came to me and told me that i
could make it, and i was strong, and not to worry, they were there. I
believed them. It's funny how much i believe just from hearing things.
Well, they lied to me, it wasn't ok, i didn't make it, i wasn't strong,
i did worry, they weren't there. A little later someone also said the
same thing, just in different forms. They <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">showed</span> me how i was going to make it, they <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">proved </span>to me that i was strong, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">they were really there.</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess it takes a while to understand that two people can say the same thing but one may truely mean it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again i was believing everything anyone would
tell me, i stopped trusting myself. At this point, that person (my
friend) leaves. Moves away, far away. There was barely any contact
between us. I fell.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no one there to keep me believing that i was
fine. So, i stopped trusing everyone. I believed nothing anyone ever
said to me because i was scared of being let down again. A long time
passes and i grew cold as ice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, my friend came back. Home again to stay. I
was so happy! i had missed my friend so much because they were back to
help me. Friends to the end right? Well, the end is staying far from us
now. Recently my friend has being trying to get their life straight
just as i was. They are doing better than i am statistically but about
equal emotionally. I get upset because my friend doesn't have time for
me anymore. With work, and sleep, and doing what my friend needs to do,
there just wasn't enough time for me. I understand this now, but then
it was just unacceptable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Lesson of my story. Always trust that if a friend does something to
change your life completely, that they usually won't leave you until
it's time. Don't get caught in jealousy because it always brings
something so much worse than what you had expected. Always Always trust
your friends, especially when they say they would give their life to
you and not have a second though (and when they prove that they would).<br>

know by my voice, or my face, or my actions. You just believe what you
have to read because you won't talk to me anymore. What's with that?
Did you find someone else to use like you used me? Do you not need me
anymore? Did i show you how to fucking stand on your own two feet and
now you can't even be here to help me on mine? </li>

  <li>I'm so tired of feeling rejected from the world.
i don't think you understand that by ignoring me it hurts me so much
that i feel like i shouldn't be in this world to inconvenience you
anymore. Why should you have to hide from someone right? Well, this is
one less person you have to hide from, i'll inconvenience myself once
again for you and hide myself, my life, my scars, my issues, my drama,

know that it's there. just for you. only to prove to myself that this
is how life is. you feel great and then you fall and there's a scar
from the person you thought was holding you up. don't worry, it didn't
hurt much. in fact, the pain from losing you hurt worse than the small
razor slowly slicing at my flesh ripping it's way to a blood vessel to
release the crimson blood out and drip down. <br>

  <li>i'm ready for you to confront me about what i've done, and all i
can tell you is that you weren't there to stop me like you promised.
you weren't there to tell me that i'm going to be ok. you weren't there
at all. even when i needed you the most, just like when i was there at
every beckoning call for you to help you through your problems. you
abandoned me. this isn't just to a specific person and you'll know who
you are. my smiles will be fake and my mask on tight but i'll make sure
there's a small part of me that doesnt hide it just to let you know. if
you paid attention to me before you wouldn't need to search for it,
you'd already know. but you didn't! no, you didn't. don't try telling
yourself that it's not your fault because you are the one who made your
choices and broke the promise you made me. that isn't anyone elses
fault.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>maybe it's my mind that makes me so corruptive and unforgiving.
Or it's the fact that it's happened too many damn times and you knew
all about it! you knew every damn thing there was to know about me but
yet you still knew how to work me, play me, operate me like i was a
little puppet for your show. guess what?</li>

I guess in the back of my mind there's always gonna be that little memory of what happened. If she means good then i'm sorry because i just don't think that's gonna leave.
   I was looking at myself in the mirror today and realized...i don't look good in green! why has no one told me? ugh! So after i changed my shirt, i decided to post in here. I need to find out what i'm doing with school. Am i dropping out for the year and going back, am i gonna strive in just a few classes to pass them or what?! I told myself repetatively that i wasn't gonna fail and be a fuck up like everyone told me i would be. Well, damn it! i did.
   I stopped working with Bob mainly because it became more like i was with him instead of working. It just got too creepy for me. So here's what happened to trigger me.
   Sunday (the last day of spring break) i was supposed to go to the beach. Well,  i decided it was pointless to go, so i stayed home. I remember Bob telling me that Sunday would be the best day to go....so i was going to.

I like it here, i'm not ready to leave. i step out into this fast paced world un-prepared and i lose my balance and fall. I hit the ground hard and lose the idea of why i thought i was ready. I get back up and dust myself off and look around at those that were helping me get back on my feet. Thanks you guys. I closed my eyes and caught my breath and when i opened my eyes again, i realized i was alone.

Concentrating on the one thing that sets me free from this place (school) is the hardest thing to do. I'm not worried about school, i'm worried about finding myself within it. I walk the halls alone most of the time. too scared to actually make friends because they just end up hurting me more than ever. I'm not ready for this world

Work is the only place i feel i can escape to and relax and be understood. Sadly i don't speak. i just sit there listening to whatever my boss has to say, giving my opinion on occasion. that doesn't bother me. 

i'm losing myself everyday. i haven't cut in a while and i'm scared because i keep getting urges to do so. I'm trying to fight them off so i don't end up like someone i used to know. my life is getting so rough on me. i just need to get away...who ever reads this...i need to ask you a favor...take me to new york, and bring me back...i need to get up there. someone there understands me, and i need her. i thought i had a chance but i realized i don't anymore. i need her more than ever right now...she can just look at me and be able to fix everything. and i know she needs me, in some way, i can feel it. ok this is beginning to hurt...so i'm stopping...bye...

Luckily, to my surprise, he also felt the way i did. It's too late. He's on his way to roanoke to see kris' brother Kieth and they are prolly hooking up, which really fucks with my head. I didn't want to push him that far away, and if he really liked me for as long as he had said he didn, then he wouldn't have done this. Well, to my idea he woudln't have. So now i'm all confused on whether or not i should pursue it any further or just let it go. Can you help me?

a burst of energy fills the calm room,
the clock, still running with it's quiet tick
the night is black with the white moon.
<br>
into the bed with the perfect blanket
alone in the house, no one around,
sharing so much love, no one to take it
he's the king, but he lacks his crown.
<br>
the thoughts that cross his mind
faded with glory, faded with time,
the lover, he searched, he never did find
walking alone, following the thin line.
<br>
they all have left, grown away from him
he needs his love, to keep him together
the darkness now, lights turned dim
broken wings, just a fragile feather.

in the wind...

No one else can fill those holes, why do they even try? I only want one guy in my life, and that's brandon. I wish he'd come in to my dry house from out in the rain. I have a nice warm home for him to come to when he's lonely. I have a big open heart for him to lay down in if he's ever lonely. I have everything i can possibly give him to try to make his life that much happier. I can't pull away from something i've tried so hard to get this close to...Come steal me away!

I thought that his love would make me free, make me smile, make the pain go away. Fate led me to feel more pain then ever this time. Because this time, i pulled away in fear of feeling what i did last time. I won't, no, i can't let myself get this upset. Yes i said i needed you and i still do, I do still love you and forever will. Obsessed? Of course, you brought me the smile i've been searching for.  Who wouldn't want that again? I'm sorry i ever did this to you. Put you in such a problem area. I'm so terribly sorry that i put that little bit of stress on your mind. I never wanted to do any harm to you. I never wanted to do harm to anyone. I Fucking Love You. Damn It!

Opening my eyes to see him in the morning is the greatest thing i could wake up to. Everyone tells me to get away before my heart breaks again. They don't understand that they only hurt me more. I want the pain. It comforts me. I don't know what it's like to live alone. I can't live alone. I have to be with someone, someone who actually knows i exist and says they care for me. Even if they don't, i still want to believe that they do. You say you care but do you ask what is wrong with me while i'm dripping blood off my finger tips. You just tell me not to do it, but you dont' question why i did it. Silly you! You'll never know because i won't let you. I'll let him know though, because i know he can help me. He makes me smile, laugh, he makes me HAPPY! You can't do that for me. And if you make me leave him then fuck you. because there will be a huge gap in my heart that not even you could fill.

Taking him away from me is like taking a child's imagination away and telling them they have to live in this real fucked up world. To live in depression, never knowing what creativity they could come up with if they had thier imagination. You telling me to leave him is like taking my imagination, my dreams, my heart away and holding in your hand as if it was yours! FUCK THAT SHIT! It is mine. You can't claim it as your own. How dare you think you know what is better for me. How dare you! Don't talk to me. Don't touch me thinking that your touch will heal my wounds that i'm inflicting on my self and you telling me that i'm wrong. I""M RIGHT! I know what i want! You don't! How can you tell me what is good for me? You don't even know what's good for yourself! HYPOCRITE!

I'm loosing who i used to be because i started to follow your footsteps down the sandy beech. I didn't realize that i was walking alone...

Can you honostly say that if i need you, i can have you? Can you say that if i'm dying you'll hold me and comfort me until i let go of my soul and let my heart be free? Can you say that you want what's best for me? No! you can't. you can't love me, i can't have you. You can't say you'll hold me because you won't let me let go! You can't say that you would give me what's best for me because you're taking the one thing i want away from me and expecting me to find it in you. You don't have what i want, nor will you ever. What i want it so be loved. Can you love me? I don't think you can. I dont think you even know what love is. You're just blinded by the good looks and sweet personality that i'm throwing out at you. Do you see the black heart inside? Do you see the blood dripping off my cuts? Do you hear my screams for help? Do you really think you know me? You only know what i tell you, but i tell you only lies. I'm sorry Debbie. I do love you, but everytime i told you i was fine, i wasn't. I wasn't. I'm sorry Ashes. Everytime you saw a smile break through my tears it was fake. So fake. I'm sorry Brandon. I got hooked on something i thought i could have. I realized now that, it was hurting me more than anything. I'm so sorry i became addicted to you. I'm truely sorry. I'm sorry everyone. I hid the truth from you. I hid what i was from you. I couldn't stand to watch people mourne over me when i'm the one who needs comforting. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry...

You claim you do, but i know that when you try to tell me, you have no clue. Will you ever open your mind long enough to listen to what i have to say, to what i feel, to why i hate you so much?

Too many thoughts race through my head as i cough and disperse this liquid on the floor. It disgusts me. I clean up the mess with the same towel i had used to wipe up the blood from earlier that evening. Lost was back in my arm again. I had missed it. The cuts deeper, darker, worse this time only to make it more noticable to people that still haven't caught on to the fact that i don't want them in my life any longer. I want to be lost, to live in my purgatory, to be in so much pain that if i survive then i know, no one can take over my life again. I would have grown truely cold hearted. You still approach me, and i push you back with all my strength making it harder for you to take another step forward. If i give up, i fall into the pit of nothingness. I will fight to the death to not fall. I will climb back up and win. You can't hold me down like you did last time. This time, i'm going to beat you to the top and you're going to know what it's like to suffer at the bottom, where no one cares for you, no one helps you, no one knows you. I open my eyes from blinking to realize that i'm still in the world, on this continent, in this state, in this town, in this house, in this room, on this chair. I grab my cigarettes and light one. Inhaling the death that feels so good. I release what little bit of anger in the smoke that trails out of my lungs and into the air. I turn around and there you are, sitting there, wondering why i wasn't responding to your questions. I get up and walk away, go outside, and drive away. I'm driving so fast the wheel is hard to control. The car is driving it's self now. I'm sitting watching my death come toward my face in the form a two bright lights.

He has no where to go, no one to hold, no one to comfort him when he needed it the most. He arrives home, no one there to greet him. Off to his room. He sits in the dark and strips off his clothes. The crimson red blood drips off him like the rain had done just five minutes before. His cuts are deep and meaningfull. Lost. In the hands of one is his life, his heart, he soul. It's being crushed. The parading light from his lighter flows through the room like energy being released. The cigarette burns with a slight crackle. Translucent smoke then is exhaled through his mouth and dispersed into the air, contaminating the room. He sits down, staring into the darkness wondering why there is no light, no one else there, nothing. An empty room. He lays down, exhaling smoke, and feeling the water from his water bed surround his body. Crushing the cigarette making the smoke thin slowly. His eyes close and lets his subconcious mind take over, where all his dreams, his hopes, his life exists. He is now....asleep."

I'm not sad, nor will I be. I have given that up. I just want to see where it is going. Is it all just for sex? Does he want more? People say there is only one way to find that out, but I don't like to deceived. I have to know what he is thinking when he is over and we cuddle. When he rolls on top of me and lays there. When he holds me. Is it because he is lonely and just needs someone there? Is he scared of dating someone because then he would have a slight obligation? I feel so lost. We can't speak about our emotions. It just does not come out right. I try to tell him everything but he tells me nothing. I wish he would open up to me. Only at night does he come over. What does he do all day? What is he hiding from me? Who are these people he speak about? Why can't I know?

I can understand how work and social life can get in the way of the day time. But there are times when we have nothing to do and he just does not want to see me. Why is this? The word why troubles me so horribly. I wish they could be answered. It's Saturday afternoon and not a word from him. Do the words I love you choke him? They don't choke me. I'm not scared to say it. I say what I feel, maybe that's the problem. I am scared of finding out the truth though. I do not want to hear something that I was not expecting. I scares me to know that maybe he just does not like me. It would confuse me even more. Especially after all that we have done together. Like I said, one step further and still without commitment."

Cussing me out and telling me all this shit about how if i ever talk to brandon or threaten her baby again, she's gonna kick my ass!! Excuse the fuck out of me, but to my knowledge i can talk to who ever i want to!!! Well, i talk to brandon about it, he gets so pissed and calls her. She says she got my number off my away message. Yeah right!! And like, Brandon says he misses me and wants to see me and all this shit. I dont' know what to believe anymore. I dont' know whether or not i should trust him again.

all of the passion
all of the peace, the heat, the pain
all those blue skies

Please, don't let me fall in love with you again

I stood on the edge
and say that you held my hand
and knowing too well
I couldn't hide from those eyes
Please, don't let me fall in love with you again

I just can't think of a way i can get it out of him without him saying *avoids question*. I think he likes someone else but doesn't want to hurt me by telling me. I personally think that it hurts more not knowing then anything. I'm guessing things should work out to be the best. They say that if you want something, to let it go, if it comes back, it's meant to be yours.
          I think we should take one candle, light it, and just watch it burn all the way down. You then will understand the flame. Why it dances and flickers at the slightest movement in the room. It's weak and it needs the wax to keep it steady and strong. Humanity is the things that cause the world to flicker. We are just stumbling on the earth looking for a reason of why we are here. It's sad. When we discover the reason, we are so thrilled, we die. Only to bring another soul into the world to do the same thing.
          That is all i have to say for the night. Except one thing...Remember that when you are done reading this, and if you decide to respond or just close out the page, always remember to be true to yourself. Be true in whatever you do. Don't do something someone else wants you to do just because it's right.

Teases are thrown at him from the people he confesses to. So he learned not to speak, not to show, not to ever reveal what is hiding under his dark clothes, his bad attitude, his tears. He walks alone, terrified of what will happen next. Depression isn't a thing to him. It goes so much more deeper than that. Friends, family, acquaintances put him down, making him feel worse. Drugs were an escape from all this, that didn't last long. Sex wasn't his scene. The only sex he can remember was rape. The pain, the abuse, the emotions, the screaming, the tears, the trauma!! Nothing was spoken from this. Fear! That's all he felt. That's all he could feel. Emotions couldn't break down his gates anymore, they couldn't get inside of him, they weren't there. So he walks, alone, unless with people like him. The people that follow in his footsteps aren't even close to being as fucked up as he was...is! Still he walked away, not understanding why they would want to be there for him, to help him, to be his ""friends"". He pushes, runs, shoves, and hurts so many people just so he can be alone. Corners were his friends. Dark corners where no one could see him. He liked being invisible to the world he didn't belong to. He has nothing that he can call his own. Nothing but the pain, the anguish, the fear, the tears...that's all. He has no materials. He isn't a material boy. All he wants is someone to love him, the way he loves them. When will that come?

"event","He sits, he watches, he imagines, he goes through complete destruction. He never pictured the world as a place he belonged. Absence through time. Destruction through emotions. Laughter didn't exist to him. Neither did love. One of his more personal things. Love just wasn't an option for him, he craved it. Craving that of a boy. Only one could give him what he needed. That boy didn't know. Didn't know the damage he cause when he said no. Didn't know why tears of blood ran cold down his cheeks. Didn't have a clue. Still, love wasn't an option for him. ::Ashes walks in::

"event","Have you ever felt like you were moving so fast, but getting no where? My webpage is becoming that way. I've done so much to it but yet there seems to be more to do with each page i add. Damn me and my ideas. Work is getting harder but still it pays. Brandon is getting closer to me each time i talk to him. I like that idea. I've finally finished all my pictures, and i'm now working on commenting on all the people on my site. But i know there will be more work to be done, especially when i get pics of ashes, and then i gotta get pics of the ""family"" at the mall. That's gonna slow me down drasitcally! So many people are waiting for my completetion of this damn site. But i won't give that link out until i'm completely done....But technically i'll never be done! White Oleander is a good movie...who ever reads this...GO WATCH IT!! I watched it one night and i couldn't sleep because of it. It was that good. THen of course i rent it on DVD and invite Ashes, Juleah, Angel, and Brandon to watch it with me. Naturally you can guess where i was... Yep, right on top of Brandon the whole time. He's so cute!!! But anyway, i have to get going now, time for work...But hopefully i'll have some more shit to write down tonight, after work. And maybe i'll finish my comments? who knows."

"event","i'm on a roll today, this is my second update in the same month...what will we do. The world must be coming to an end. LOL. Anyway, let's update you. I'm still after Brandon, yeah, i know, it's pitiful. But still, i mean, you can't control who you like. He isn't a bad person in any way. Right now i'm at Crystal's house, without crystal...And everyone is asleep...so i'm scared to play music becuase i like to hear it loud. Oh well. Have you ever looked into the mirror and not recognized yourself, not because of make-up, or a new hair cut, but really didn't see yourself in it? Doesn't it send cold chills all the way down your spine? Like you don't exist. I feel that everytime, which is why i'm scared of pictures and mirrors, or anything that shows your true self. People hide themselves inside their make-up, piercings, and hair styles. In doing this, you never get to know your true self. I guess I'll never know myself very well. But i do know this. Be all that you want to be, becuase when you think about it, you only have this one life to live. so live it up...and live it well. In doing this, you never need to know who you are...you just remember who you want to be. Be fake, it's the only way to be safe.

On better news.... everday i'm one step closer to getting the one thing i really want....if you know what it is...don't ask...if not...then ha ha ha...you won't know until i'll tell you. So i hope you're someone special. Specialty is so over rated these days.  Specialty can be anything. A rock can be special because it got stuck in your shoe and followed you to the person that you now are in love with. And when you find that rock, you hold it and think ""wow, this must be lucky to me because it was the thing that made me trip on my new b/f-g/f. It is so special to me, i'll keep it forever"" People do this all the time, isn't that odd. That people can do just about anything and make it seem right becuase  that's how we work. We see something and think something else completely opposite. Why do we do this... are we scared of something we don't need to know, are we just that clueless? We'll never know. I guess in a way we are clueless....becuase we can't know if we are...or are we?

"event","Like oh my god!!! I so forgot i had a journal.... Oh well, let's update you on my...umm....lack of life....yeah. So anyway, i still am lacking in a man...still trying. I got one more hole in my head, my lebret pierced. I was going to get my tongue pierced but i can't do it anymore because I'm tongue tied (that's when the cord of your tongue is too close to the tip). Brandon came back to Virginia, finally! I was so happy. We were talking about dating last night, but he wants to get to know me better, which i think that means that he kinda likes me but not really. I am soon getting new pictures with my lebret but after the swelling goes down and i look almost normal again.... *exhales* Me and Ashes are still fucking...friends, that is. 

*ashes in background* ""WE'RE WHAT?!!, oh, friends...yeah"" *hits blake* ""JERK, i have a hole in my ass, LQQK!"" Well, while ashes is on the phone, i'll continue with my story. FUCKING MUSIC!!! I WANTED TO LISTEN TO JEWEL!!! Ashes is trying to tell me that we always listen to my music in the car....sadly she forgot the CD player doesn't work so we don't. Yes you did, ash. DAMN MOVEABLE KEYBOARD. i don't. no i don't ashley. Yes i misspelled your name the first time but look it is corrected now!!

Now....to the dedication to the people who actually check this and realized wow...he hasn't updated. 
HOLLOW--I LOVE YOU!! WE NEED TO HANG OUT, BUT YOU ONLY CALL ME TO DELIVER MESSAGES THAT I NEVER GOT AROUND TO DOING.
ASHES--I LOVE YOU!! UMM...WOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT I SAID TO HOLLOW!
EVERYONE ELSE THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER--HI!! HOW ARE YA?

Now, people, please please please leave me comments so that i have a reason to update this and actually check this...ha ha ha...bribery.

ANYWAY! Brandon, Juleah, and myself...all hung out a few nights ago. So naturally, we dropped Juleah off really quick....she was annoying... After that, Brandon literally told me...
""Blake, do you have a curphew"" 
""No, not really, my parents are too stoned to notice""
""Oh ok, good, because i'm not taking you home....now.""
""Umm...ok, whatever""
""so what do you want to do?""
""i'll do just about anything right now (i was happy cause juleah was gone and she has all those damn restrictions)""
*breaks out in song*

well, umm...yeah, that was a little odd. *covers ashes eyes* it's a secret...
that's all i didn't want ashes to see. *looks around* *licks lebret ring*

*ponders on whether or not ashes will kill me if i steal her coffee*
Yep she will!
let see...ashes had 2+1/2 pot of coffee...12 cups each pot, humm...that is...*counts on fingers* 30+1/2 cups of coffee. I'm drinking the other half now...*slight dance*

""ANOTHER DOCTORS BILL, LAWYERS BILL, ANOTHER CUTE LITTLE CHEAP THRILL"" 

I'm the last one!!

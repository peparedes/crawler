"event","Editor's Note: The below story is copyrighted as of July 1st, 2006.  Any reproduction without prior written consent will result in legal action against all parties involved.  Also, this is a -draft- of the story, meaning it has basic errors and revisions.  Any changes made in future sections will be posted in a section similar to this.  If any kind of advisory (such as the legal disclaimer listed above) needs to be posted, it will also be found in this kind of section.  As for the story flow, all sections are considered part of the same chapter.  Side sections (think of it as the bonus materials) will be listed as part of the title.  Also keep in mind that this is set in a fantasy world, so don't always assume reality and this story will go hand in hand.

Seeing as to how this is a draft, comments and critiques are greatly appriciated.  Any individual for whom I use a change or suggestion will be noted accordingly.  Also, please refrain from comments such as ""t3h 0mg j0 r t3h sux.""  It's not a critique, it's just you being rather assinine about a simple comment and thusly making yourself look rather stupid in front of a large audience of people.

Also included in this window text box is a list of each section that I post.  Each link follows the sections in the order they were posted.  It will be divided into three categories: story, side stories, side sections (bonus materials).

That being said, please keep in mind that you are reading at your own risk and are hereby notified that you alone are legally responsible for any actions you make as a direct result of reading this story.

Thank you for your time. Please, sit back and enjoy the story.

You're wounded!""<br /><br />""Then here I will die, protecting all those I care about!""<br /><br />As the battle waged on, casualties&nbsp;fell upon&nbsp;both sides.&nbsp; Men began dropping like flies, all dieing from injuries they sustained.&nbsp; As the reinforcements arrived from the castle, those of us on the front line decided to fall back.&nbsp; Many of us had been fighting for hours and had wounds that needed urgent care.&nbsp; As the field medic cut open my brother's shirt to examine the wound, I heard an unfamiliar sound. <em>Bft.&nbsp; Zft. Pft. Bft. Zft. Pft.<br /><br /></em>I rushed outside the medical tent, gazing into the sky.&nbsp; The demons had finally decided to try their ranging skills against our army.&nbsp; Arrows fell from the sky, hitting any and all things below them.&nbsp; I turned back around to warn the medics. <em>Thck. Thck thck thck. Thuck thuck thuck.</em>&nbsp; I didn't even get a chance to form the first word.&nbsp; The medical tent was pierced by at least fifty arrows. I saw the blood trailing out of the half open tent flap and&nbsp;at that exact moment that, I knew my brother was dead.<br /><br />Still, I needed to see it with my own eyes.&nbsp; I needed to know for sure.&nbsp; I felt my stomach churn as I reached to pull back the leather flap.&nbsp; My eyes were greeted by death.&nbsp; Nothing but death.&nbsp; Hundreds of arrows lined the bodies of the medical staff.&nbsp; My brother lay almost&nbsp;motionless on the medical table.&nbsp; Arrows pierced through the table, pinning him against the cold steel.&nbsp; His eyes fixed on me, filling with tears of blood.&nbsp; He tried to open his mouth, but no sound came out.&nbsp; I could see it.&nbsp; I could see the fear in his eyes.&nbsp; I watched as he struggled to breathe, but no breath would enter his body.<br /><br />I walked towards his body, drawing my sword.&nbsp; I closed my eyes and said the only thing that came into my mind.&nbsp; ""The brightest light shines only in the darkest night.""&nbsp; His gaze turned towards me as I lifted the sword up over my head.&nbsp; I heard the arrows fire off in the distance.&nbsp; I swung the blade down, piercing it through my brother's heart.&nbsp; I saw the brief flux of pain in his eyes, then saw peace sink into them.&nbsp; I opened my eyes, pulled my sword from his chest, and turned to leave the tent.<br /><br />The commander was calling for a retreat as I exited the tent.&nbsp; We were outnumbered and had suffered too many casualties to continue with the battle.&nbsp; The commander watched as the way I looked towards the enemy.&nbsp; Something was different in my eyes.&nbsp; I couldn't see them, but I could feel it in my heart.&nbsp; I wasn't afraid.&nbsp; I wasn't sad.&nbsp; I wasn't feeling anything I should have been feeling at that moment.&nbsp; I felt cold.&nbsp; I felt uncaring.&nbsp; I felt as though they could fill my body with arrows and I wouldn't feel a single one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The commander grabbed my arm as I took a step forward.&nbsp; However I had looked at him sent a chill down his spine.&nbsp; I could see a look of fear as he gazed into my eyes, more so than the fear he had just seconds before.&nbsp; He let go of my arm and took off running with the rest of the troops.&nbsp; I lowered my sword to my side, watching as the demons came closer to me.&nbsp; I could smell them.&nbsp; I could smell the blood that dripped from their bodies.&nbsp; I could smell the odor that came from them.&nbsp; I could smell it all.<br /><br />The demon general approached me.&nbsp; His gaze was fixed upon me as he circled me.&nbsp; I watched as the demons surrounded me pointing bows and spears towards my body.&nbsp; A tightly knit circle around one center point.&nbsp; The general stopped in front of me, staring deeply into my eyes.&nbsp; ""You are not like the humans, yet&nbsp;you are also not a demon.""&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;second he took one step towards me, I thrust my sword into the ground in front of him.&nbsp; He stepped back, puzzled by my actions.&nbsp; I stepped back and began to chant under my breath.<br /><br />""Third circle, fire...""<br /><br />""What are you doing?!"" the demon general shouted at me.<br /><br />""Fourth circle, earth...""<br /><br />""Stop your chanting now, human!"" he shouted at me.<br /><br />""First circle, air...""<br /><br />""You leave me no choice but to kill you, half breed!""<br /><br />""Final circle, bane...""<br /><br />The demon commander screamed as he rushed towards me.&nbsp; He drew his sword back, ready to cleave my body in half.&nbsp; As the sword came crashing down, I rushed into his chest and pressed both my hands against it.&nbsp; Suddenly a giant dome of darkness and fire covered the entire demon army.&nbsp; They screamed in pain and in fear.&nbsp; Haunting wails filled the air as they tried to run and escape, only to be greeted by a wall of fire blocking them.<br /><br />""Sphere of Shadow Flame,"" I said to the general as he stepped away from me.&nbsp; ""It incinerates every living thing inside of it, scorching even the earth itself.&nbsp; All I need to do now is say the final word, and this pointless battle will be over.""<br /><br />The general looked towards me one last time before he let out his final scream.<br /><br />""Collapse.""<br /><br />I blacked out as soon as I said that final word. I felt the flame take over my body, tossing me far from the rest of the demons.&nbsp; That's the last thing I remember.&nbsp; When I awoke, I was in a small house with no windows.&nbsp; A young woman stood beside me, examining my face in the candlelight.&nbsp; My eyes reflected the light of the flame, throwing her off balance for a moment.&nbsp; I sat up and reached to my side.&nbsp;&nbsp; My hand slid around as though it were lost.&nbsp; I was trying to find my blade, but found nothing but flesh and cloth.&nbsp; Then the scent suddenly hit me.<br /><br /><em>""Blood,"" </em>I said to myself. <em>""Why do my hands reek with the scent of blood!?""<br /><br /></em>""You've been out for quite a long time,"" the young woman said to me.&nbsp; ""When we found you, you were laying near dead in a small field.&nbsp; If the hunters had not gone out that day, you surely would have perished.""<br /><br />""A fate worthy of this curse,"" I mumbled, barely coherent to anyone listening.&nbsp; ""I don't deserve to be alive after what I did.&nbsp; Demons or not, they deserved the right to live just as much as you and I do.""<br /><br />""Demons?""<br /><br />""They attacked out of nowhere.&nbsp; We were surrounded.&nbsp; My unit tried to hold them back until reinforcements arrived.&nbsp; By the time they got there, my brother was already seriously wounded.&nbsp; They took him to the medical tent just in time for a volley of arrows to rush through it.&nbsp; I saw him.......pinned to the table....and did the only thing I could think of.""<br /><br />""Which was?""<br /><br />""I drew my sword and ended his life.&nbsp; The suffering in his eyes....so much pain....so much...hurt....&nbsp; I couldn't bare to see him like that.&nbsp; Then something happened to me.&nbsp; I felt...such hatred towards them.&nbsp; The army retreated back, and I stood there.&nbsp; The demons surrounded me, like vultures swarming a dead body.&nbsp; This power...inside of me.&nbsp; It took over.&nbsp; I could see everything that happened, but had no control of my body.&nbsp; The general said something about a half breed, then this being began some chant.&nbsp; Once the chant was over, everything was set ablaze.&nbsp; Darkness and flame surrounded the entire demon army.&nbsp; They screamed in pain and agony.&nbsp; I couldn't do anything.&nbsp; Next thing I knew I was soaring through the air, then I blacked out...""<br /><br />""...And you awoke in this room, right?""<br /><br />""Exactly.""<br /><br />""Do you have any idea where you are?""<br /><br />""No.""<br /><br />""You're in the eastern edge at the village of San Saria.""</p>"

No matter what you say about love,
I keep coming back for more,
My head in the fire,
Sooner or later I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life,
I learn every time I bleed.
The truth is a stranger
My soul is in danger,
I gotta let my spirit be free to,
Admit that I was wrong and then change my mind.
Sorry but I have to move on and leave you behind.

I can't waste time so give me the moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry about everything I've done
Lived every second like it was my last one.
Don't look back got a new direction
Loved you once, needed protection.
You're still a part of everything I do, you're on my heart just like a tattoo,
Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you.

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking ties.
When I look in the mirror,
Didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could stop
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind.
Sorry but I gotta be strong and leave you behind

I can't waste time so give me the moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry about everything I've done
Lived every second like it was my last one.
Don't look back got a new direction
Loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do, you're on my heart just like a tattoo, I'll always have you.

If I live every moment
Won't change any moment
Still a part of me and you.
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do.

I can't waste time so give me the moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry about everything I've done
Lived every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
Loved you once, needed protection.
You're still a part of everything I do, you're on my heart just like a tattoo.
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you."

I'm going to be a sophomore and actually doing research this summer. It's completely insane and I'm not really sure I'm ready for it all yet. I don't know what to think or what to feel really...it's all insanity. 

I just want to curl up in my bed and sleep for a good 24-48hrs. But I have to get through these next two weeks. Last final week I hardly slept...I need to make sure I don't do another repeat of that...*sigh*

Can't wait for summer..that is what getting me through these next few days..."

"event","I've been living with a shadow overhead 
I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed 
I've been lonely for so long 
Trapped in the past, I just can't seem to move on 

I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away 
Just in case I ever need em again someday 
I've been setting aside time 
To clear a little space in the corners of my mind 

All I want to do is find a way back into love 
I can't make it through without a way back into love 
Oh oh oh 

I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine 
I've been searching but I just don't see the signs 
I know that it's out there 
There's got to be something for my soul somewhere 

I've been looking for someone to shed some light 
Not just somebody just to get me through the night 
I could use some direction 
And I'm open to your suggestions 

All I want to do is find a way back into love 
I can't make it through without a way back into love 
And if I open my heart again 
I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end 

There are moments when I don't know if it's real 
Or if anybody feels the way I feel 
I need inspiration 
Not just another negotiation 

All I want to do is find a way back into love 
I can't make it through without a way back into love 
And if I open my heart to you 
I'm hoping you'll show me what to do 
And if you help me to start again 
You know that I'll be there for you in the end"

"event","I was reading an article that my writing workshop professor handed out and there was a quote that caught my attention. 
<center>""Writing is a form of personal freedom. It frees us from the mass identity we see in the making all around us. In the end, writers will write not to be outlaw heroes of some underculture but mainly to save themselves, to survive as individuals."" </center>

I think that explains in a nutshell why I still have this livejournal. I started it because someone told me about it. But I'm still writing in it because its a way for me to express my ideas without people giving me weird looks to tell me I'm overreacting. I can write anything I feel, no matter how silly it might be, without fear of judgment.

"event","It feels like I'm back in Massachusetts. It has been raining ice for the past two days and because it is the south...they put no salt or sand on the road and campus has been closed. The only think open is Mabee because all the stairs to get to upper campus are closed off with the inches of ice on them. Needless to say I'm going crazy...there isn't any real work to do because I haven't had that many classes! It's starting to get annoying because we can't even leave campus because all the cars are covered with ice and the roads are a mess or closed.

There was a henna party the other day though. I have a pretty design on my hand which makes me happy, now if I only had a place to wear it to...

I hope classes start and I can just move on. Sitting around lets my mind wonder and when my mind wonders I start dreaming and wishing...and none of those dreams are coming true lately...I'm so tired of being disappointed."

I've always loved looking up into the sky at the clouds or just at the stars and the moon. If you've ever seen the way I decorate my room that shouldn't be a surprise. The only constellation I can really remember from elementary school is Orion, which happens to be right over my house tonight...a sort of guardian angel. 

I've been in a weird mood for the majority of this week. I've kind been thinking too much and have been pulled into myself in a sense. I get this way when I get really stressed out, but I think this comes from not knowing and just taking it to heart. I've always been really emotional...sometimes it's a strength because I'm passionate about my work, and sometimes it's a downfall because I can't always bounce back quickly. So I'm sort of suck here for now and I don't really know if I want to come out. I think I need a break from caring about...I'm opening to get some answers soon and I'm really getting nervous. Knowing my luck though, nothing is going to happen and I'll be left without closure once again. CeCe is coming Saturday and I move back in Sunday...wish me luck?

Finding a good man 

We got a bucket of corona, 
Enough stories to last all night. 
About the trials and tribulations of finding Mr. Right. 

Finding a good man. 

Heres to the liars and the cheaters 
and the cold mistreaters. 
To the momma's boy's who cant make a stand. 
Heres to the superficial players, 
the i love yous to some sayers. 
If you hear me girls raise your hand. 
Lets have a toast, heres to finding a good man. 

Blind dates and horror stories. 
Pushy guys and fast movers. 
Lets dedicate this girls night out 
to bad talkers and bad losers. 
Its so hard finding a good man. 

Heres to the liars and the cheaters, 
and the cold mistreaters. 
To the momma's boy's who cant make a stand. 
Heres to the superficial players, 
the i love yous to some sayers. 
If you hear me girls raise your hand. 
Lets have a toast. Heres to finding a good man. 

Julie I know you want perfection. 
Angie you want a listener. 
Lisa your list is getting longer. 
Girls you know me I want a good kisser. 

Heres the liars and the cheaters 
and the cold mistreaters.

"event","I just have to comment on the beautiful weather here. It was 60 degrees today and nice and sunny. I love being able to walk outside with just a light sweater and now worry about freezing. It makes it very easy to walk around the track...which I'm going to start as soon as classes start again. Maybe I'll even start running again. <br /><br />This break has been filled with my hiding out in my room and reading. I've been doing just that for the past two hours. Right now I'm reading <i>Wicked</i> which has been very entertaining. I've read about 7 books so far this break. A few of them were mystery books from a series I haven't been able to read since the summer. I've decided to keep up with my running during classes, hopefully I'll have some time. Reading for me though is an escape of sorts. I get so involved in the book, if it's a good one, and I am able to forget about all the other things that bother my mind. I hide out in my books you might say until I can do something about what I'm thinking about. <br /><br />The closer school starts the more nervous I get about the whole situation. I feel like I messed up the last two weeks of the semester. Then a part of me says, who cares what everyone else thinks. You did want you did and you didn't mean anything by it. I bounce between feeling like I need people around me and I need to make them happy and the feeling that I need to make myself happy and just not worry about peoples' thoughts of me so much. I'm usually a very independent person, but what people don't realize is I need to have people around me that care about me sometimes when I feel vulnerable. I'm not interesting in making casual friends and probably come off as kind of cold just because I don't open up to them as much. Oh well...I've pretty much given up trying please people after high school experiences...I just still harbor a guilty feeling sometimes...even though I probably shouldn't.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Survery Taken from Geri"">1.

"event","I can't believe I've been on break for a good two weeks now. It doesn't feel like it's been that long, where does all the time go? I'm not really complaining though, I'm ready to get the new semester started and to figure some things out finally.

Overall my break has been restful. I love getting 12 hours of sleep a night. It's been nice to sit and do nothing but read for hours on end. :)

Frustration has been a big theme though. I got through stages of acceptance and just a whatever feeling and then back to the frustration and wanting answers. Last night that's where I was yet again, but it helped a lot to talk it all out. I guess I'm just going to have to wait it out and see what happens in the coming weeks...

I want to wish you all a very Merry Christmas! It feels weird to not be freezing and have no snow on the ground, but I think it finally feels like Christmas for me.

When the sun is hard to find 
When it's rainin' in your eyes 
When the shadows block 
those pretty little blue skies living inside you 
When the fallin of your tears

When you just can't see the light 
Baby I'll find a way to shine

"event","I'm home and have been for the better part of this week. The semester is finally over and I'm happy and sad about it. All my friends live outside of San Antonio and most of them outside of Texas, it's going to be a long break. 

Overall the semester has been a good one. The beginning was a bit boring, but the end definitely got exciting, sometimes in the worse ways. I'm not having much luck in some departments and its a little frustrating. I'm taking a passive approach next semester. I'm going to throw myself into school and maybe get a job. I'll wait for things to come to me before I make a move, but me being forward about the situation hasn't worked out for me yet. It's annoying, but I'm tired of being disappointed. I'm not looking for amazing, amazing comes with experience. I'm just looking for something to be there and for arms to curl up in when I need to escape. Maybe things will work out better next semester...

I have a pile of books waiting for me and a lot of sleeping to do. 12 hours a night these past three days has been amazing. At least I will be able to relax this month. A friend might be coming to see me before school starts, that will be nice. Juel comes down in a month and a half! :) That is just amazing!"

I need to get a lot of crap done and I don't know if I have enough hours in the day to do it. Tomorrow is going to be a total nightmare. It makes me second guess biochem sometimes.

Here's a beautiful song. Kinda makes me teary eye, but I'm also overtired, so don't take my word for it. 

Darryl Worely :: I miss my friend
 
I miss the look of surrender in your eyes 
The way your soft brown hair would fall
I miss the power of your kiss when we made love
Oh but baby most of all
I miss my friend. 

The one my heart and soul confided in 
The one I felt the safest with 
The one who knew just what to say 
To make me laugh again 
And let the light back in 
I miss my friend. 

I miss the colors that you brought into my life 
Your golden smile, those blue-green eyes 
And I miss your gentle voice in lonely times like now 
Saying it'll be alright 
I miss my friend.

The one my heart and soul confided in 
The one I felt the safest with 
The one who knew just what to say 
To make me laugh again 
And let the light back in 
I miss my friend. 

I miss those times 
I miss those nights 
I even miss our silly fights 
The making up 
The morning talks 
And those late afternoon walks 
I miss my friend.

The one my heart and soul confided in 
The one I felt the safest with 
The one who knew just what to say 
To make me laugh again 
And let the light back in 
I miss my friend. 

I miss my friend. 
I miss my friend. 
I miss my friend.."

But I found out that the bio book is the one I kept!! And so is the Italian book I used! :) So, I'm feeling pretty excited. Even though this college seems more intense than WPI, I've learned the material already so it shouldn't be that big of a deal...hopefully.

So, I just wanted to share my excitement...even if it might be a little boring. I'm feeling pretty good right now! :)"

""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone 
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters 
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better

I'm pretty sure I bombed my CS assessment this morning. I know how to do things on the  computer, but don't ask me what the computer is doing to get it down. A lot of those questions I don't think anyone would know unless they were a computer geek and build computers. We will see how it all goes Monday. 

I found out I need to take a bio and a chem course this semester to get on my major plan. I've already gotten credit for the bio course, but I believe I need to take the lab. So, two science labs and a lecture shouldn't be too bad. I love sciences anyways. I don't have to worry about a calc class since I got credit for Calc I-III that makes me really happy! :)

I wish everyone luck with moving in and starting off this semester. We've all been there and done that, so I'm sure none of us will have any problems. :)"

"event","before I move in. It's scary and really exciting. I'm ready to get back into the school routine, but I'm having problems getting motivating to pack for the journey. I've been sitting around all summer waiting to move in and I'm still in that mind set. I have things I want to do before I leave Friday morning and I don't know why I have to push myself to get it all done. *shrug* I know it'll all work out...it's just coming up too fast for me to wrap my head around it. It's a weird feeling, I don't think I'm describing it well...

Normal :: Katrina Elam

Everybody does it, that's what everybody says
As they smoke their cigarettes on Friday night
And if you're still a virgin by the time that you're a junior
Then the rumor going 'round is you ain't right

Maybe I'm <i>hard headed</i> or a little bit <i>old fashioned</i>
But I <b>always</b> had a hard time fitting in
So when they rolled their eyes at me and told me <i>I ain't normal</i>
I always took it as a <b>compliment</b>

Where I'm from normal is high school girls having kids
Marrying the boys that you grew up with
<i>They say girl get your head on straight
You sit around and dream all day</i>
That far away <b>look in your eye ain't normal</b>

Somebody's got to wear the roller skates down at the Sonic
But it never really fit into my plans
So when I up and moved 1000 miles from Oklahoma
<i>Nobody in that town could understand</i>

Where I'm from normal is high school girls having kids
Marrying the boys that you grew up with
<i>They say girl get your head on straight
You sit around and dream all day</i>
That far away <b>look in your eye ain't normal</b>
(But) I say yeah, <b>what's so great about normal</b>

I don't know what happens but that's okay
'Cause I know what wouldn't happened if I stayed"

Life Ain't Always Beautiful :: Gary Allan

Life ain't always beautiful.
Sometimes it's just <b>plain hard</b>.
Life can knock you down,
It can <b>break your heart</b>.

Life ain't always beautiful.
You think you're on your way.
And it's just a <b>dead end road</b>,
At the end of the day.

<i>But the struggles make you stronger,
And the changes make you wise.
And happiness has it's own way,
Of takin' it's sweet time.</i>

No, life ain't always beautiful.
<b>Tears</b> will fall sometimes.
Life ain't always beautiful,
But it's a beautiful ride.

Life ain't always beautiful.
Some days, <b>I miss your smile.</b>
I get tired of walkin' all,
These <b>lonely miles</b>.

And I wish for just one minute,
I could <b>see your pretty face</b>.
Guess I <b>can dream,</b>
But <b>life don't work that way</b>.

<i>But the struggles make me stronger,
And the changes make me wise.
And happiness has it's own way,
Of takin' it's sweet time.</i>

No, life ain't always beautiful.
But <i>I know I'll be fine.</i>
Hey, life ain't always beautiful,
But it's a beautiful ride.
What a beautiful ride.

It still doesn't feel real though. It just feels like I'm going to Texas for a vacation like I did last summer. I'm going to be staying with grandparents and in hotels for a month, so it might as well be a vacation. I think July is going to be a sad month for me. Until I move into my house, it's not going to feel right. I'm hoping to just relax and try to have fun. I probably deserve a month without worrying about anything. 

In other news, I should be finding out about my roommate soon. By tomorrow afternoon, I should have an email about it. But the deadline has been pushed back so many times, with my luck,it'll probably happen again. *sigh*

Some people they just give up
When the hard times fall
The thrill all is gone
Leaves you in a cloud dust

And others won't recognize it even when it comes
We are all at the mercy of the will of love
Some people aren't luck like us

Two lonely souls that just stumbled into fate
Look how much we've been given babe
In spite of all of our mistakes
<b>And I will never forget I've been blessed with the gift of lovin' you</b>
And when the going aint easy babe
A little faith will pull us through
<b>Thank God we have each other we can hang onto</b>

You are a very grounded, responsible, and realistic person. People may not want to hear the truth from you, but they're going to get it.

Senior Dinner was fun. I enjoyed see everyone again and I think I got some good pictures. The yearbooks turned out nicely and hanging out that afternoon was fun. My grandparents came up and it interesting. I don't really know my grandparents very well, so I was glad to go to the academy thursday and friday morning. My grandma can get on my nerves sometimes and if I'm really tired that tends to happen.

Senior Breakfast was fun. Cute pictures taken again. I came home to balloons and a dozen roses. I also got a cake which was yummy. For presents I got a digital camera! :-D and a pretty diamond necklace. :) Graduation itself was fun, but I left really early. I got kinda sad, so I wasn't up to pushing around people. Being overtired beyond belief also added to things. I went out to dinner at Chili's which was yummy too.

So, overall it was a fun week, but being tired didn't help. This week will be kinda slow. I'm hoping to get my pictures back sometime today or tomorrow. I didn't get my camera until after graduation so I haven't had a chance to use it. I plan on bringing it to parties though and putting it to good use before I move.

I don't really think it's hit me yet that I'm done with high school...it probably won't until I turn up for orientation mid-August.

PS: Like my new icon? It's one of the roses I got for graduation. I wanted to play around with my camera so I took pictures of the pretty flowers. :-D"

Oh brother I can't believe it's true

You can take a picture of something you see
<i>In the future where will I be?</i>
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how do you feel?
Well I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see

You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or a write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done
Do something that's never been done

So you don't know were you're going, and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored

I just feel a mixture of feelings, and I don't know how to react to the whole situation. *sigh* But right now, I'm happy and I'm pretty lucky that this year has gone better than I expected. It's nice to have a year without fighting or anything like that. I can't wait for Prom either...it's going to be a good time.

I guess that's it for now....have a great night all."

"event","I'm finally done with my SISP work that I should have been done with 3 weeks ago. Now I'm only a week behind my timeline! :D

Besides that this week has kinda been sucky. But I think I'm starting to feel better. Philosophy is going to be a blast...I need to find a tree Monday...

I'll leave you all with a truly great song.

We Go Together

We go together like ramma lamma lamma ka dinga da dinga dong
Remembered forever as shoo-bop sha whada whadda yippidy boom da boom
Chang chang changity chang shoo bop that's the way it should be

Our names are signed boogedy boogedy boogedy boogedy shooby do wap shoo bop
Chang chang changity chang shoo bop we'll always be like one
Wa-wa-wa-one

When we go out a night (oh-h oh)
And stars are shining bright (oh-h, oh)
Up in the skies above
Or at the high school dance
Where you can find romance maybe it might be lo-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uve

Ramma lamma lamma ka dingity ding da dong
Shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yippity boom da boom

Chang chang changity chang shoo bop
Yip da dip da dip shoo bopp sha dooby do
Boogedy boogedy boogedy boogedy shooby do wap sho bop
Sha na na na na na na na yippity dip da do
A womp bop a looma a womp bam boom

We're for each other like womp bop a looma a womp bam boom
Just like my brother is sha na na na na na na na yippity dip da do
Chang chang changity chang shoo bop we'll always be together

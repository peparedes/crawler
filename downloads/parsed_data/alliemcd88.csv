"event","I never really got into this livejournal thingy and I haven't written in it in over a year, but I thought I'd write an update.  Senior year has been a blast!  I have wonderful friends and I love them so much.  Formal is coming up and that should be a lot of fun.  I'm excited about moving on and becoming an adult, but it is now making me feel kind of sad.  It is exciting though.  Planning out my move to Santa Barbara with Juliet and the party house we will rent out has been amazing.  I hope it all works out the way we plan it to. :)"

"event","DC was a lot of fun. The Redkins lost though! Dammit! Oh well, it's only pre-season. 

I'm excited to be going home in less then a week. I miss my buddies and I miss my Mommy. I'm still in the process of convincing my Mommy to let me bring my beloved kittens Charlotte and Emerson, but I doubt she'll give in. I love my babies, but they'll have to wait till I'm 18.

It made me happy to play phone tag with my Juliet. Oh wait, dammit! I always do that. She wants to be called Jools. I keep messing that up. I love it when she calls me with the latest gossip. I'm so behind on the times here in Chicago, but I'll be home soon.

I realized that I'm entering baby zone. Kelci was given due dates ranging from August 18th to September 3rd, so that means that little Nora McDougall will be here soon. I can't wait till she comes because Joe and Kelci are going to be really good parents. I hope to be a good aunt. :)

As much as I want to go home to San Diego to see everyone, I find myself kind of sad. It marks the end of summer and the end of realaxation. And to top that off, I'll be away from my Daddy. It's hard because I only see him 12 times a year, and that's not a lot. Sometimes, I feel like I don't really know him. It sucks.

Anyway, I decided to start a new little something in my livejournal, ""Quote of the Day."" And todays quote is, ""Your boobs are like pillows from heaven."" 

Goodnight!"

"event","Today was good. I went shopping with Katie at Woodfield Mall. We went to American Eagle, Nordstrom, and Urban. Lauren would be proud :) Anyways, I found some really cute stuff and I plan to go back tomorrow since my time was very limited due to Meg's need of my stepmom's car, but at least I'm getting out of the house on a regular basis now.

It's been really cold here. Chicago is supposed to have heat waves during the summer, but no, I have to get the 56 degrees weather. I bet SD is beautiful right now. I miss the beach so much! Being in Chicago has really made me realize that I adore my apartment back home. 

I talked to Seth this afternoon. He said that being back home in Arkansas really sucked and identified with my loneliness. We both discussed how much we missed Juliet. We all want to make out with YOU Juliet. hahaha. Or wait, he still calls her Jools. I will always refer to her as Jools the Zonie while in fair speech. I loved fair so much this year! I can't wait till next year.

Tomorrow I will be packing for Virginia. I'm going to see the Redskins in there first home game of the pre-season. I'm really excited because I've never seen them on their home field. All of my previous Redskins games experiences have been really bad because I've always been rooting for them on other people's turf. After being in those situations, you realize how bitchy people can be when it comes to football. When will people realize that it's just a game, not a life or death situation???

Well, I miss my buddies back home with all my heart! <333 My friends have made my isolation so much easier to bear. I hope all is well in SD. And oh my gawd, I'm forgetting Jason in New Jersey!!!! I can't wait till you get home and we'll have our planned Las Vegas wedding. hahaha. Goodnight to all!"

"event","I'm so pissed off. Someone hacked into my AOL account and fucked everything up. Whoever it was, was an asshole with way to much time on there hands. It's kinda scary that someone who can hack into your account would make things so difficult. It just goes to show how much tecnology controls in our world today. I almost want to change my screen name completely and just hope for the best. Dammit this sucks!!!

Before this, my day was great. I went for a run in the rain and got in touch with a lot of my friends. I love hearing about what's going on back home, but yet, it makes me really homesick. I'm so glad that Juliet isn't grounded anymore. Good for her! I can't wait till I get home, so I can hang out with my girlies. Too bad this day had to be ruined. Much love to Jessica, Juliet, Nicole, Lauren, Jason, Scott, and Dani who made my day interesting. Love and miss everyone. Nighty-night. Mwah!"

"event","3 more weeks till the big return to school. It's actually kind of exciting. Things will be so different though. All of the past Seniors are gone. They'll all be spread out around the country in college. It's so weird to me. I'm so glad that Jessica will still be in San Diego. And to top that off, she'll have her own apartment. I feel like I'll get to see her more than I did when we went to school together. She'll have so much more freedom. School will be wonderful even though the Seniors are gone because I'll have Juliet, Lauren, and Nicole. I love those girlies. Next year will be very interesting. I'm sure we'll have a blast though. It seems like everyone is changing. I know that I have. The past 4 weeks have really been a time of getting to know myself. I've been writing songs like crazy and that always makes me feel great. I don't know if I'll ever be able to share my songs with anyone, but at least I'll have them for myself. My songs are so personal. I guess that I just don't have the courage. Ah well. I can't wait till I get back... 2 more weeks! I want to give everyone a big hug! 

Good luck in life to JH, AG, SS, JK, RP, ZB, AM, AD, KB, NT, AB, and AN. You'll always be my favorite Seniors. <333"

"event","Tomorrow I'm going to Michigan. My dad's good friends own a cottage up there and we're bringing my pupppies so they can swim. I'm actually kind of excited about it. Lately, things have been going really good. This week has been very relaxing so far, and the best part is that I fall asleep each night and I've been having the greatest dreams about anything and everything. The reason why I'm so excited about this is because I haven't had a single dream since I've been in Chicago. Ne way, I was happy to find comments from Jools, LC, and Cola. I love those 3 because they always make me feel so much better whenever I'm down. I don't know what I'd do without them. I am so excited right now too because I found the song that makes me happy everytime I listen to it. It will always be my favorite ""Ice Cream Hit"" to dance to. Jools knows it as ""Mud On The Dance Floor."" Thanks to Emily, I realized its existence. And I'm serious, that song is so freakin' addictive. Well, I'm going to bed and hopefully I'll have another great dream."

"event","I'm finally on track with my goal for summer! Yes! Not much is new right now. My daddy is in Maine golfing with his buddies. I'm jealous of his trip. Juliet, you are definitely free to come kidnap me. PLEASE!!!! I've been doing my usual exercise/tanning bit and I'm feeling completely relaxed with it. Tomorrow Meg is taking me to Ren Faire with her friends. It should be interesting... Well thats about it. Laters!"

"event","hello my people!!! i finally created my live journal (just for you LC!) anyway... chicago has been interesting to say the least. i feel like i'm living in a zoo! There are puppies and kittens running around everywhere and it's crazy around here. I miss my gals sooo much. I find myself staying up all night trying to find something to do with my time and during the day i sleep till 2. wow... it really takes a lot out of me. since i'm not that interesting here in chicago, i'll talk about my starting summer events. hmmm... THE FAIR!!! a lot of interesting stuff went down. me and jools worked the ice cream stand and hung out with our trash boys. i had nick... and now i wallow in self pity at my new found loneliness, but that's beside the point. wow i sound really lame right now, but moving on, juliet had seth... and gerrad... and matt... and trunk organizer boy... and derek who didn't work at the fair, but he has a really cool house. and we had the coolest boss ever... JOE! that's about it for the fair. lauren went to spain and did all sorts of interesting european things and i came home everyday smelling like fair cattle... and NO i'm not bitter! hahaha i'm a loser! ahhhhh... it's really late... so tired... laters -Love Al"

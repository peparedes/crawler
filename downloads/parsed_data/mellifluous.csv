"event","This year has been so amazing thus far. I graduated from BCC, which felt like nothing short of a miracle. And here I am just a few months later holding in my hands the most important letter I've ever received. All of the nightmares I had about getting rejected proved to just be anxiety and not premonition. Here is the letter:

It feels incredible to work really hard toward something and then actually getting it. I can't believe I almost didn't apply because I didn't think they'd accept me.."

"event","""I am in Montreal, got here on Wednesday. We got me a bike. Drinking sooo much delicious beer. Loving that so much. We watched Communion. This keyboard is so weird and it is hard to figure out the apostrophe symbol so everything is very proper right now. I have gathered oodles of quotes and photos already, I can barely wait to upload them! Tonight we are going to a venue on top of a bike shop called Friendship Cove, where Pulling Teeth and a few other hardcore and punk bands are playing. I also am going to try to see Set Your Goals. Definitely Obits, and Frightened Rabbit. Maybe Pyschotropical Orchestra. Right now the music Skyler is playing sounds like fairy jams. I stick out like a sore thumb here. I feel like everyone can tell I am not from here. Did I mention I fell off my bike? I blew my tire out and it sounded like a gunshot, and I bent the frame. I didnt get hurt, but I did feel like a dumbass. Haha. We are at the Plateau right now so we are going to walk around and get food. Who knows if the apt. will get internet soon, otherwise this might be my last update for a bit. I have another new blog, but I will post the link later. It is a blogspot. Okay, this post makes me sound weird and out of touch because of its formality. Whateva.

"event","I'm not sure what has come over me these past few months, but whatever it is, I hope it never leaves. I've been washed over with optimism, unrelenting love, and forgiveness. One thing I've realized is that the beginning of those feelings coincided with some major personal belief realizations that I had. I've thought about it a lot and I am a bit confused by it all, because I thought that my morals would crumble or my heart would harden after such a decision and realization. I thought that some sort of cloud of guilt or wrath would hover over me, but the exact opposite has happened. I've grown more than I ever thought possible and have had an incredible time doing so. I feel so lucky and so incredibly privileged, more so than I have ever felt in my entire life.I find myself smiling everyday, and I am so excited about everything that the future holds. I am even excited to fall in love. This is a big deal for me, because I am not a relationship person. I like [to an extent] being single. I don't know when love will happen, and I'm not looking for it (actually, I'm hoping to avoid it as much as possible while in Melbourne, not like that'll be hard..), but I've realized that I am ready again. I have put everything, and everybody behind me, so my slate is clean. It's something that has been on my mind a lot and puts me in a surprisingly good mood. 

I am still making mistakes these days of course and still trying to figure myself out quite a bit. But this makes me feel more comfortable with myself and a lot more whole. I'm less scared. I'm more willing to try. I am pushing myself and it is paying off. I still get sad sometimes too, but it never stays. I've always got a way to make myself feel better, whether it's talking to my mom or taking Boots on a walk or just listening to a good album. 

(I have found a new weakness in myself though: Other people's pessimism. I've always had a slight issue with this, but now it's gotten stronger. Pessimism, a lack of adventure, and an unwillingness to change = my least favorite things these days.)

I've found lots of images that correspond to how I'm feeling these days (or ones that are just pretty), so I'm going to post a few. I've been loving text heavy graphics recently so that will be a recurring theme here. Enjoy.

St. Augustine, FL
Miami, FL 
Jacksonville, FL 
Gainesville, FL
Tallahassee, FL  
Atlanta, GA 
Savannah, GA
Kansas City, MO
Charleston, SC
Chattanooga, TN

Iowa City, IA

Whoops, I forgot a few:
Daytona, FL
St. Petersburg, FL
Clearwater, FL
Ybor and Tampa, FL

And more than half of those I went to at least twice between '05 and now. I've taken four road trips, which is pretty darn good, because that's all I've ever really wanted. And soon I will get to go to CANADA!!! Oh man, life is sweet and I am so grateful.

"event","So I've been dragging ass about a lot of stuff since the summer started. I came into thinking I'd complete tons of stuff or do tons of things, but so far this is all I have done:

+/- Laid out once for like... ten minutes (This summer I wanted to do lots of sunning and swimming. I need to fix this ASAP)
+ Saw Kings of Leon in St. Augustine (planned)
+ Saw Death Cab / Ra Ra Riot in Orlando (unplanned)
+ Turned 22 (inevitable)
+ Got my AA, woo
- Sold nothing, got rid of barely anything in the garage sale
+ Fixed a few things and made a few other items
+/- Bought even more stuff, whoops
+ Apologized to a certain person, FINALLY 
- Had a lot of headaches, 70% of which were just hangovers
+ Went to Miami (gawwddd I had the best time EVER)
- Forgot a good friend's b-day, making me feel like the biggest d-bag ever
- Slept through another good friend's b-day, doubling my d-bag-ness
+ Got contacts
- Already lost two of them. Well I know for sure I lost one, but the other one I think is lost somewhere in my eye cavity. And that sort of weirds me out
- Have still not gotten my hair done, hence me relying heavily on hats to cover my roots
+ Applied to FSU, currently in the process of applying to UNF and UF, still need to apply to UCF (blech!) and possibly some schools in KY and TN
- Still have not bought my plane ticket to Montreal

Totally pointless list, I know. But I sort of just have to lay things out for myself and see if I have even done things. I've had a lot of fun so far, but as for really accomplishing things... not so much. I NEED TO STOP BUYING THINGS. That is my main thing I need to do. It is so hard! Friggggggg this headache is killing me and stopping me from writing anything more. BOOOO."

I am FOR SURE graduating on Thursday! 
I had been waiting on pins and needles to find out my official grades, and they just posted them last night. My math class was the determining factor of my graduation so I was ultra nervous since I got a 75 on my final exam and I had figured out that I need at least an 80 to pass, though I had extra credit. So I can now rest easy knowing that I don't have to take the CLAST over the summer (which I'd have to pay for AND take in Orlando) and end up graduating in the fall instead. I can finally apply to colleges without any apprehension, I AM SO EXCITED!!

US History Since 1877      C 	
Math for Liberal Arts 2    B 	
Community Involvement      A 	
Introduction to Sociology  B

Not too bad for me, considering this was my most stressful semester EVER! On top of all that I logged 33 hours at Daily Bread serving food and washing more dishes than I can count. I'm pretty darn proud of myself. I feel now like my life can finally go on. Siiiigh. :D

Now I can finally say it - Screw you math, you freaking suck and I am so glad I never have to deal with your bullshit again! EVER! I want to set my math book on fire, teehee"

As I reflect on the stories of my youth I dig deep for a kernel of truth 
These are the kind of things that keep us up at night
I've yet to find those fairy tale endings save for the times I was just pretending 
These are the kind of things that keep us up at night
What does it mean when we mean what we say but we keep losing faith every day.
Deliver me from this wasteland, deliver me from feeling alone.
These days at best are a shadow of what they should have been.
Deliver me from this wasteland, deliver me from feeling alone."

1) i kind of can't believe it, but i have a 79.5 (plus mad extra credit that is not factored into that) in my math class! that has never happened! i am so terrible at math so let's just hope i can keep this trend up, especially since this test on wednesday is gonna be a mega doozy.. if i can keep a B, i'll be exempt from the CLAST! 

2) this whole time i thought the application process for transferring to university was gonna be some huge ordeal so i've been putting it off for ages. but i just did it online for FSU and it wasn't bad at all, unless i am missing some epic part of it. it sucks though because i missed the deadline for the communication college application... though it allowed me to choose that anyway. we shall see. 
i still have many more applications to fill out and related stuff to do. blarrgghhh.

3) there are only a few weeks left of this semester. i'm tweaking out because there is a lot that needs to be done - 25 or 30 hours of community service (WASSUP DAILY BREAD TOMORROW) and journals to go with each day worked as well as a final paper about the whole experience, a big ol' paper to write for history (WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION FTW), math tests, keeping up with sociology and trying to bring my grade up in there... **BRAIN EXPLODES**

4) i got to school today really excited for a cold ass diet coke. what did i get instead? an ""ICE COLD 102 DEGREES"" coke. not diet, either. i tried drinking it, and winced as the acidic formula started to coat my mouth and throat. hell naw, soda machine. i wanna kick you. 

5) my best friend is awesome:
(these were sent while she was out of town)
her: I miss u girl :-)
me: I miss you tooooo ive been so bored hah
her: Aw man thea i dont feel complete
me: Aw why dawg?
her: THEA its so cheesy but gawd i love u!
me: Haha that totally made me laugh out loud but d00d i so love you too!
her: Ur the best ive ever had! Gawd im gay!
me: Aaaahahahaha r u taking KrAzY pills?!?
her: :-) Naw dawg just love u

awwww. we wuv each other. and we WUV ""gawd"", and ""dawg"", which are coincidentally spelled from the same letters. 
i don't know what i'll do when i move for school! now she is thinking about moving to miami so we'd be a jillion miles apart, GAHHHH!! we are going down there in the next week or so, it'll be my first time to miami so i am excited but am dreading how hot i think it'll be. i keep hoping i'll run into dexter, haha. 

6) in the past couple of weeks i have finished season 2 of dexter, and season 1 of 30 rock. now i'm watching venture brothers again so i can delete episodes so i can have more room on my hard drive. after that it's eastbound and down and frisky dingo. gawwwddd frisky dingo is SO AWESOME."

"event","I do not recall a day where I felt this defeated. To not be able to write a paper due to a mental block is one of the worst feelings I've ever had. That may seem like an over exaggeration, but writing is supposedly my strong suit, yet I can't squeeze out some dumb Sociology paper? Ugh. And on top of that, I have cramps, my room is a wreck (which always stresses me out), and I'm not prepared for Harvest of Hope whatsoever. I think all my problems sound petty, but really it's just the school thing that is dragging me down. I really just can't get over how lame I feel for not being able to complete my paper in time. It took me so long just to do the annotated bibliography, I can't even imagine how long the actual paper would have taken if I had completed it. The turn in time was midnight and I sent her everything I had, including a letter explaining my mental block and whatnot. Hopefully she will be sympathetic to a college student having a small meltdown. It's a pretty ridiculous rule that any paper not turned in results in AUTOMATIC FAILURE. I've got a history midterm on Monday which I am also not prepared for, so that's also on my list of worries. Gah, my priorities are all out of whack right now, why do I do this crap to myself? I just need to isolate myself and become a hardcore bookworm. I'm rambling. I'm just bummed/annoyed/frustrated/emotional/cranky. Whatever happens, I'll deal with it. This isn't the end of the world."

"event","For some reason I have always saved my work schedules from the shop. I went through my filing cabinet today and decided that I have no reason to keep them so I'm going to recycle them. But before I tossed them I counted them. <B>I had over 140 schedules filed</b>, many of those being two or three week schedules on each paper. Geez louise. I have had this job so long it's insane. I always joke that it's been my longest relationship ever. And I realize why - I love it, and I'm good at it. Today I sold $700 worth of ladies clothes to three girls (granted their grandmother was paying, but still..) so that felt good and felt like old times when people actually bought things. Siiiiigh. Going through the schedules and seeing all the people who have cycled in and out makes me nostalgic, but it also reminds me that I soon will be one of those people that will have cycled out. 

I'm finally taking care of my application stuff, but it looks like I might be S.O.L. because I've got a 2.98 and after this semester it might even be lower. I was doing fine until last semester when I got all C's! Gah, I don't know how to fix it, especially since I'm in my last semester. I'm gonna give the rest of this semester hell and see what I can accomplish. I'll keep my fingers crossed.."

-Have recently found that I think middle finger pictures are hilarious. A little juvenile but who cares.
-Wish I had my own place. I keep thinking Gainesville or Tallahassee sure would be a nice place to live, at least while I'm in Florida. School will decide this for me, though. 
-Am on a major ""trippy shit"" kick. Visually, aurally, anything stimulating, really. 
-A few months to do nothing but clean my life up a bit would be glorious. I don't think it'll be this summer unfortunately, there are far too many other things I want to get done this summer. 
-Really need to get to Canada this summer. This means my passport needs to stop hiding. 
-Want to read more! GOSH.
-My hair needs to get long and wild and unkempt. I'd love to go back to my natural color at some point. I can't continue to dye my hair the rest of my life. Too expensive and time consuming.
-Want to eat healthier. And just drink loads of water and tea and kombucha. 
-Speaking of kombucha, I want to learn how to brew it myself. 
-Want to walk myself ragged. I want to soak in the nighttime breeze and sweat out what ails me.

"event","Okay, so let me preface the results of this semester by saying this my hardest semester yet and though I did work really hard, I still think I could have worked harder so I'm honestly pretty darn happy with my grades.

US History to 1877 - C
Macroeconomics - C 	
Math For Liberal Arts 1 - C

PHEW. My math teacher rules because he hooked us up with grade, i.e. making it possible for me to pass.
As for my macro grade, I was averaging C's all semester, and towards the end really started to lose it on how to do some of the things. It got really hard and had no idea how to regain my footing with the material so I'm glad that I didn't do too terribly in there. And my history class.. I actually though I'd have a higher grade because I felt like I did well enough on the test to make at least a B, but maybe the essay portion got me. 

This also means that I have 2.98 GPA (ehhh..) and 55 credit hours. SO CLOSE TO GETTING OUT! I will post my 2009 LAST SEMESTER!!! schedule soon."

I am trying to remember a time when I didn't want, and I don't know if it ever existed. I have never been deprived in my life, yet I am always wanting more, more, more. Being in my room is actually annoying these days because of all the stuff I have in here. Sure, it's organized somewhat and I like the way it looks, but there is just too much stuff. I dread the day I move because it's going to be the biggest pain EVER. I have got to cut things out of my life now or I will have no savings (well, I actually already have no savings WHATSOEVER) or space later. I get annoyed when my mom chastises me for my spending habits, but why? She is just looking out for my well-being so I can actually afford things that matter and are necessary. All of this is driving me nuts and today I am taking action, damnit!

I have this image of Jesus (this was the only version I could find on google) framed in my room. I need to have this thing shoved in my face at all times as a reminder...

There are fireworks going off outside which just makes me even happier. I'm a wreck right now - a really happy wreck, if you can imagine. 

When I called my mom earlier to talk about him winning, she reminded me that when she was younger and went to school, there were separate water fountains for the white kids and the black kids. And my mom isn't really even that old - she's 55. To think that we have come so far from segregation and extreme racism all the way to electing a black man as the President...it's phenomenal.

"event","Dudes are SO sketchy! And grimy and conniving! But no harm done, my heart is fine. Phew. I'm just wiser (and perhaps a little less trusting) from these past few weeks.

So this will sound completely sarcastic, but I assure you it's not: I love the fact that I know my friends well enough and love them enough that we can talk things through and not be petty bitches. I had imagined some dramatic soap-opera confrontation, but it was exactly the opposite. We shared what happened and laughed about it and now all is well. This makes me happy and I felt 100x better after talking about it. Best friends are ALWAYS more important than guys, no matter the situation. Sounds like a cliche ""Babysitter's Club"" moral lesson, but until you get into that situation, you won't know how tempting it is to be a backstabber or liar. (Sorry for all the ambiguity, I just don't want to air all my dirty laundry on here.)

Well, life is good, and things are about to slow down reaaal fast, now that October (aka insane party month) has come to an end. Today is the last shindig - Carla's birthday at her place.  Horror movies, a little booze and best friends. I couldn't ask for a better close to this month (even if today is the 2nd). I'm really, really thankful for the friends that I have."

"event","Here's another excerpt I wish I had read years ago. But today, it is so fitting. I can't stop focusing on my failures and mistakes. But reading this helps.

""Not many second chances exist in the world today. Just ask the kid who didn't make the little league team or the fellow who got the pink slip or the mother of three who got dumped for a 'pretty little thing.'... Nowadays it's more like... ""Gotta get tough to get alone."" ""Not much room at the top."" ""Three strikes and you're out."" ""It's a dog-eat-dog world!""
Jesus would say, ""Then don't live with the dogs.""... Why let a bunch of failures tell you how much of a failure you are? It's not every day that you find someone who will give you a second chance - much less a second chance every day. But in Jesus, you find both.""

--------------------------------------

I just want to isolate myself so I can't mess up. But at least at this point in my life I know that is a terrible idea, because I wouldn't learn at all. I wouldn't learn from the multitude of mistakes I am going to continue to make and the shortcomings I will surely endure."

"event","I don't know how long this can all ride in my subconscious. Even if I don't think of you when I'm awake, you show up my dreams. This must have been the 100th dream with you in it. Last night, I saw you for ""the first time in a year and a half"" (well, actually almost two years now), and you acted as if nothing had changed. You gave me a Christmas card. I can't remember if you closed it with an ""I love you, girl"" or not, but I didn't care. The fact that you were there and talking to me was enough. 
This is something that has been just tumbling around in the back of my mind for so long and when you make your little mental appearances it just lingers and drives me insane. I don't know what it is about you in particular but I don't think I'll ever be able to forget you. And I don't necessarily want to forget you. But I want to forget these rejected feelings. I want you out of my dreams and out of my head and I don't think either can happen until I get up the guts to talk to you again somehow or I magically get my brain erased (which would be so convenient and lovely at this point).

Edit: After I wrote this, I drove to school to take a quiz for my American History class, which I love. But I couldn't remember ANYTHING. And it's not like I haven't been working hard or studying... there was a brick wall up in my mind that I couldn't get around, no matter how hard I tried. All I could think about was this dream and the memories and all sorts of other depressing stuff that I wish I could push out of my mind. I ended up writing my professor a note on my test letting him know the situation. I feel like such a loser for not being able to handle this better."

- Hosea 14:4

I just now found this, but I wish so much that it came to me years ago:

""Are you convinced that you have never lived a loveless day? Not one. Never unloved. Those times you deserted Christ? He loved you. You hid from him; he came looking for you. And those occasions you denied Christ? Though you belonged to him, you hung with them, and when his name surfaced, you cursed like a drunken sailor. God let you hear the crowing of conscience... but he never you go. Your denials cannot diminish his love.

Nor can your doubts. You've had them... While there is much we cannot know, may never know, can't we be sure of this? Doubts don't separate doubters from God's love.""

"event","-I do not remember how to spell out the number 40. I think it is ""forty"" but I keep thinking it may be ""fourty"". The mental debate I have with myself over the spelling is slightly degrading.

-I have been having stomach aches a lot the past few weeks. For example: I am on annoying stomach ache #2 of tha' day. That should not happen. And I know Activia, the yogurt by Dannon, has good bacteria in it to ease tummy pains, but I really can't help but be a little weary of it. I don't want to be infested with parasites and end up like Carl:
<img src=""http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a358/theaict/southbronxparadisediet.jpg"">
But if a massive parasite bust out of me, at least that'd be a cool way to go out.

-I currently command you all to turn on a good dance song and watch this video at the same time. I will admit to cackling earlier and then rewinding it and cackling some more. Something about this bear really made my day. 
<lj-embed id=""4""/>

-Question: Is there a bar lamer than <a href=""http://www.extremelounge.ca/francais/photos_makos.htm"">Mako's?</a> I think I know the answer (which should be a resounding ""No"") but, I would love to be enlightened to worse establishments. Also, gross bartender in the hawaiian bikini thing - I know those free ""shots"" were pretty much sweet and sour mix. You didn't fool ANYONE! 

-Ever since my brother moved my hard drive into my computer, it now sounds like a cat purring. Or a phone vibrating. Or maybe an odd combination of the two. But either way, it is getting on my nerves. I just can't win with my computers, man. 

-How many sandwiches can I make in exchange for an hour (okay, even a half hour works) back massage? Some funky business is going on in my shoulder blade area, and I am gettin' PISSED! I need these knots to be worked out STAT. Someone hook it up. Or suggest a cheap place to go to for a massage. 

-Went to Cafe Tutu Tango's last night in Orlando and let me just state that more restaurants need to be that ridiculous. It is perfect for people with ADD because there is so much stuff going on at one time that it took us all about 15 minutes extra to even figure out what to order. They apparently have four kitchens as well so multiple servers brought out our food and messed that up twice, giving us two free entree/appetizer things. Did that make sense? Either way, it was DOPE. There were belly dancers as well as some dude who was NOT A MAGICIAN! But was amaaaaaazing at cards the way a magician is. He just happens to hate magicians. He also had a lisp, which was sort of adorable. We all wondered how many hours were logged in his bedroom just working on shuffles. If you are not familiar with the restaurant, here is their site: http://www.cafetututango.com/     (More like www.redonkulous.com)

-I am in a great mood today, if this entry is not obvious enough evidence. It wasn't anything in particular really that triggered this feeling but somewhere, the clouds in my mind and heart cleared and it just feels good. And it's just now hitting me that love, without contest, is the best thing that God created. The complexity of the feeling even makes me smile knowing that what I have felt thus far in my life is only a small percentage of what my heart has the potential of feeling."

"event","So I've actually seen Brevard's creative side recently. 
<B>Friday:</b> Art show in downtown Eau Gallie that was so rad. There were all different types of work in there too - wood work, paintings, photography, mixed media, etc. I was honestly so surprised to see how great all of it was, and it was put together really nicely in the gallery. Some bands played outside too, amongst some of the art. 

<B>Saturday:</b> 
Let me just preface all of this by warning all of you to <B><BIG>NEVER DRINK THIS CRAP</B></big>:
<IMG src=http://newatlasbev.com/images/quilalime.jpg>
(It has 300 mg of caffeine, vs. 30 to 40 mg in a soda.)

A guy at work told me about it so I had a can of it and well.. 
Here is what happened: 
- I sweat buckets. Gross, I know. But I have never sweat more while just standing than I did after drinking this terrible beverage. I ended up buying a new shirt because I felt so disgusting
- I peed like 9 times within five hours
- My hands were shaking uncontrollably
- I couldn't focus, so much that I messed up the drawer at the end of the night
- My stomach hurt for about 8 hours after drinking it
Never. Again. Blahhasdfkjklasdf

Anyway! 
Hooooly crap! This night I will never, ever forget. I went to the Metro after work where there were tooons of roller derby people and tons of buzz about the main event of the evening.I saw an industrial band in person and I surprisingly LOVED it. Random fact about me: I used to love industrial music, so this was a total throwback for me. After that the real show began... BODY SUSPENSIONS! 

<lj-cut text=""Don't click this if you get queasy easily"">
The group that put this on is called Skin Mechanics Suspension (http://www.myspace.com/smsuspension) and it was really well done and very entertaining. Watching it the entire time made my stomach tighten in anticipation of something going wrong, which never happened (thank God). It was amazing to see in person what limits the human body can be pushed to. These pictures barely give the presentation justice, but you can get the idea:
<img src=http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a358/theaict/suspension3.jpg>
<img src=http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a358/theaict/suspension2.jpg>
<img src=http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a358/theaict/suspension1.jpg>
<img src=http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a358/theaict/suspension4.jpg>
Also I just wanted to post a picture of this guy Raymond who is in the last picture. He looks identical to McLovin' from Superbad (though it might be hard to tell from this picture, it was the best one I could find on their myspace). It was eerie how similiar he looked to the real thing. But anyway.. he rules. 
<img src=http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a358/theaict/mclovin.jpg>
</lj-cut text>

As for Sunday.. I ended up at the Metro for the third night in the row, which was fine by me, I really like that place. There were bands playing in both theaters and again felt like some weird throwback, but this time it was just sort of awkward for me and made me feel old and jaded. It was also odd because one of the bands that played sounded just like Beneath Low Flying Planes, making the experience for me even weirder. After that I ended up with Trystan at someones house and getting extremely pissed off by a friend of a friend and it just made me wonder why some people have to be so arrogant? And such assholes? Ughh. While there though I saw a bit of a Straight Edge documentary and it really got me thinking about how much I miss that whole lifestyle. It got me a little bummed because I do miss the unity of it all and how good it made me feel. But I'm fine with the changes I've made in my life. I was definitely in my own little edge bubble for a long time and I'm glad to have reached outside of it. 

To conclude all these random little updates I will say that I am actually on a program now to get myself into shape. I am 20 pounds overweight and though I want to contribute all that to beer, it is also from other terrible eating habits of mine as well as a lack of exercise. So though monitoring my diet so closely is going to be a pain in the ass, I am going to put forth the effort. I've never had such a gross body image in my life so I figured I should change it. Woohoo. 

Farewell for now, boys and girls!"

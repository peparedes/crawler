WHEN: Friday night/Saturday morning at midnight.
WHERE: My house.
THEME: UNDER THE SEA PIZZA PARTY

You heard it. The party is officially on Friday night at midnight. Come dressed as your favorite sea creature if you wish (this is highly encouraged). Bring some soda or beer or whatever you drink and movies and sea themed snacks. We're going to watch movies and play pool  and chill and be awesome.  

Note: To have the party there's a ""TEN SUPER HOTTIES"" requirement by the roommates. That means you. You have to be there or I'll be kicked out of the house.

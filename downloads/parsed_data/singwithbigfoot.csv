"event","Last night I had a dream. It went something like this and probably was my best dream since the zombie/BitTorrent fiasco of late 2005.

(It's good enough to revive this livejournal, at the very least)

I was driving to my friend's place. We for some reason lived in the inner-city of some city. I unfortunately do not recall any names; I wish I could give credit where credit is due.

While driving, I noticed, in a manner redolent of that one scene in Cloverfield, that a bunch of rats and miscellaneous critters were flocking in the opposite direction. I, of course, came to the natural conclusion: that a T-Rex was rampaging the city, leaving all sorts of death and destruction in its wake, of which not even rats want a part.

So I pulled into my friend's place, at which several individuals whom I called friends (again, no names or faces, unfortunately) all were hanging out in the living room and playing some unidentifiable videogame. I told them a T-Rex was rampaging through the city. This, of course, met no protest and was taken as fair warning. We strongly disliked it when T-Rexes tore through our city.

As we were dismantling the lights or whatever other things a T-Rex would use to find and eat us, I suddenly recollected several instances wherein I fought quite valiantly against a T-Rex, each time scaling its back ala Shadow of the Colossus and stabbing its head. But my T-Rex-fighting days were over; I was a coward, and I only assisted my friends in unscrewing light bulbs because some lights evidently did not have a corresponding lightswitch.

At one point two of my friends refused to shut off the game, despite my emotional exhortation concerning the T-Rex's optical schematic, which relies on heat, movement and sound. After citing Jurassic Park as a scientific journal, my friends finally agreed to switch off the game console.

We headed into the basement, and I woke up.

I'm disappointed in my Jurassic cowardice. I could have saved lives, had I only not so incorrigibly given up my dinosaur-hunting ways. Fuck.

OTHER THINGS

This semester is going quite well. I like all my classes quite thoroughly, even though my work ethic in French still is inadequate.

My job is quite swell this time around, if only due to the leverage with which I am able to decide the extent to which I partake in each of my duties: senior reporter, proofreader and editorial-writer. Writing editorials is always a treat, and I'm enough of a pedantic asshole to enjoy proofreading.

I am still nowhere closer to deciding what I would like to do after graduation, though grad school still remains a viable option. I've briefly considered law school, but I haven't the stomach for forensic theatrics. I think I'd like to spend a couple years in the Teach for America program, helping provide for inner-city kids the inarguable advantage I received through factors clearly beyond my control: quality teachers.

I hadn't much considered the program until I received, somewhat accidentally, an invitation in my e-mail to meet some former participant. I would have taken the opportunity, but it was targeted toward May '08 grads; I was on the list only because of my advanced senior standing. Oh well, I'll look more into it next year. I'd make a competent composition or basic math teacher.

I have a phone interview with the Muskegon Chronicle next week for a reporting internship that would be indescribably awesome. Aside from being an awesome paper in an awesome locale, the Chronicle pays reporting interns $400 a week, a sum I would quickly blow on hipster work attire; but the point is, I would have <i>so much</i> hipster work attire. I've also applied for a myriad of copy editing internships - another possible career option - but I've yet to hear back from any of those. I'll hopefully acquire something, somewhere for the summer, at least."

"event","I'm sick, it's cold, and I've too much shit to do - and while it makes absolutely no sense to blame climate for the third portion, all of this is Michigan's fault.

It took <i>one day</i> of sub-freezing weather to dismantle all my antibodies' defenses, which had kept me safe and well all winter. I hardly got sick; I think I had a sore throat for maybe a day, but that was vanquished by Centrum silver, orange juice and DayQuil. But the second my anatomy felt it could take a rest, the second the weather appeared to have removed some of the burden, this shit struck. The Great Lakes lured me into a false sense of security. That stint of pleasant weather was little more than a viral Trojan Horse; my nose and throat now are under constant siege.

Moving from feeling like shit to doing shit:

My graphic design professor assigned our most recent project, a CD case design, several weeks ago. She was kind enough to offer us an additional week to work on it. That said, I started it tonight - and while I do not feel completely overwhelmed, nor do I feel totally fucked (at least, by standards determined by how wholly fucked I've been on prior projects), this still is going to require a certain number of hours I'd rather spend, say, watching Heroes or another show I shouldn't get into. And not only that, but the more I experiment with graphic design and artistic endeavors, the more I realize the written word is my preferred method of expression; even my designs, which are often simple and text-heavy, reflect this.

Despite my artistic ineptitude, I like the concept behind my CD project. I've compiled a series of 10 songs within the Mountain Goats' ""Going to"" series. The package is not exceptional, nor is my sense of track order; but the key point simply is I enjoy any opportunity that permits me to say ""the Mountain Goats are fantastic, and here is why,"" and this is one of those. For this reason I cannot entirely hate the project.

I am still, thankfully, writing a ton. The qualifier ""thankfully"" is crucial: The more I write, the less free time I have to do <i>absolutely</i> nothing; and as I've determined long ago, stagnancy equates to self-deprecation, which in turn translates to feeling like garbage all the time. I can say I no longer feel like garbage all the time - I have something to do, and it is something I enjoy doing.

This leads to my newfound fear of summer. I currently have no solid internship lined up; this should come as no surprise, as I submitted resumes that had less than one semester of writing experience. This deficiency led the Kalamazoo Gazette to, as far as I can tell, shoot me down; or, in kinder terms, it was the production editor's ""sense that my one semester at CM Life is not enough experience to be one of their summer interns."" Ah well, I got a couple good games of phone tag out of the whole thing - it was fun while it lasted.

Cutting my losses, I still stand a shot at landing the Metro Times internship, though the copy editor with whom I spoke said competition is fierce. I managed to submit some newer clips, including Wesley Clark's speech and a senior job hunt feature, so hopefully that will at least score me an interview. If not, I'm not totally sure what I'll do or where I'll go. I don't really want to speculate on not having <i>anything</i> this summer - even if the Metro Times falls through, I have a couple smaller leads - but I am committed by any means to avoid a repeat of last summer, in which I spent a month jobless and the remainder at a job which, while all right, was hardly fulfilling.

I had envisioned this romanticized hipster city life in Kalamazoo, in which I would live as a top-notch reporter by day and happening guy by night. It would have been a radical departure from my life in Troy last summer; a radical departure was what I wanted, and the internship seemed like a favorable medium. But that quickly unraveled, and now I'm almost certainly heading back to Troy and the tepid life that goes with it. The best I can hope for is a job a bit more active than some two-night a week waiting gig.

I've been encouraged to stay around Mount Pleasant and CM Life for the summer, but, ugh, weekends like this remind me how desolate the city can be when nearly everybody is gone. Maybe if I can find a decent number of people staying around, maybe if I could find some solid roommates - but for now, I doubt it. Mount Pleasant probably will remain a fall/winter/spring sort of place for me.

I'll romanticize <i>next</i> summer - if this fall I'm not applying to nearly every decent paper within every decent city, hit me across the head. Promise me that."

"event","It's slightly narrower, I think. The top line is also blue. I'm not sure how I feel about that; I kind of liked the consistency and reliability of gray. Know if any sentence seems poorly cast, that blue line is to blame. Why disrupt comforting symmetry, livejournal? 

Half-hearted justification for not updating for the past two months:

I have written a lot of things. That is by and far the main reason I haven't felt like updating this stupid thing. I for once in my life have neither time nor drive to record banal observations and ruminations. 

I like to view myself as a daily allotment of words. I use them when I must, should or want; livejournal has, in the past, been a dump for the excess. But recently, they've been directed elsewhere. All of my classes are writing-intensive, and I'm writing for CM Life as much as the editors will allow. It's taken a full week of break to accumulate enough words to muster a livejournal entry. And because one of my sources returned neither email nor phone call, I'm left with a spare few hundred - here they are:

CM Life has been, by and large, very good to me. After an early snafu, beginning with an accidental double assignment and ending with an encouraging promise of free lunch if such a mistake is repeated, I've found a job that a) reassures my affinity for my major and b) finances - though barely - my irresponsible concert habits. I've written something like fifteen articles over the past month, and I can say, in a way much deeper than my superficial love rooted in free cheesebread from my last job, I do enjoy my work. 

Let me put this in perspective to stress importance and unlikelihood:

I applied to Central only because an enrollment officer (or whatever the fuck they're called) came to Athens and I wanted to skip out of class. I filled out the application during calculus, and I'm pretty sure it was in pencil. I knew nothing about my future school except that it was a temporary escape from my current school.

The honors program forced me to pick a major my first semester, and livejournal comments guided my decision.

I don't believe in divine providence, nor do I believe in fate; but I cannot help but appreciate the several strokes of dumb luck that have pushed me past academic despondence. Really, by all means, none of this should have worked. But there is something to be said for at last feeling nearly comfortable that you've found your niche, some sort of metaphysical coziness. 

On the other side of my degree, the history side, I've read, enjoyed and reviewed several hundred pages of Swedish history. I had to do a book review for my Craft of History class, and I've always been curious about the Swedes. Moberg, the book's author, though occasionally biased as hell, wrote a pretty solid history: his narrative was lively and entertaining (at least by history standards), and I don't think anyone, sans maybe Shakespeare, has so brilliantly depicted a royal family whose favorite pass time was fratricide. 

I found both it and its second volume in hardcover online for 20 bucks, and I ordered them. This makes me either the coolest or lamest motherfucker on the planet - possibly a little of both.

The majority of my break has been marked by futilely applying for summer internships. I have a few that could but probably won't work out. The two largest and most desirable are with the Kalamazoo Gazette and the Metro Times. I spoke with the editor at the Kalamazoo Gazette during my flurry of phone calls Monday, and she said I could still apply, despite my missing the application deadline by over a month. I expressed gratitude and immediately mailed my stuff. It'd be a pretty sweet deal, though, if it did happen - I'd get to be Nick's roommate for the summer, and we would tear Kalamazoo apart / probably see lots of shows at Kraftbrau.

The Metro Times internship would be unpaid but with paid freelancing opportunities. Fortunately, increasing my chances of not appearing like a total deadbeat, its application deadline isn't until the end of March, though I still mailed a resume and clips on Monday. I like culture magazines, and I'd probably score (or so the website led me to believe) lots of free swag. 

I'll follow up on those next week. They will likely fizzle in spectacular fashion, but for now, I'm going to act like they're viable options. Things are, at the moment, looking up, goddammit."

"event","I am tired, inexplicably.

Fortunately, I just drank a Cherry Coke, the benefits of which were two-fold: Quenching my thirst and providing a source of rejuvenation. The chemicals in my brain, clearly, were not up to snuff; I've more or less borrowed the drink's chemicals to supplement the inadequacies of my own. Eventually they will have done all they can, surrendering to my own lethargy - I could ask my fridge for more, but I'm not a total mooch.

The reason for my weariness is, admittedly, easy to pinpoint: I got fewer than five hours of sleep last night, and even those were plagued with tossing and turning as though I'd gone to bed solely to toss and turn rather than to sleep. I hadn't. 

I don't quite understand my occasional bouts of, though relatively mild, insomnia. I've nothing in my life over which to lose sleep - everything's <i>square</i>. Yet I continue, though metaphorically surrounded by peaches and roses, to toss and turn within said bed of peaches and roses; to be fair, I have mild allergies to pollen. It's perplexing. Not that normal cases of insomnia aren't - though their causes are easily identified, their solutions are not. This is a different league of perplexing, however: per-fucking-plexing, if I may. It is the very tier at which the English rule of profane interjection is applicable, confusion and consternation combining into one syllable - fuck - which is then conjugated to fit a given word. That is <i>precisely</i> how I feel.

That said, I have developed an infallible method to induce drowsiness, and it doesn't even involve NyQuil. I've dug deep within myself and found perhaps the most useful sleep aide known to man, or at least known to man with this singular experience:

When I find myself unable to sleep, eyes closed but mind not, I imagine myself at 7:50 AM, sophomore year of high school. I am sitting in Mrs. Chan's trig class. I've already eaten my bagel - the high point of my morning has come to a close, and now Chan will lecture and likely force me to move at some point within the next 50 minutes. I finished the day's history assignment no more than four hours earlier, and three hours stand between me and lunch. 

I lie my head on the desk.

Within the next fifteen minutes, I am consistently able to fall asleep. I'd never imagined Chan's class would do me much good - I'd always considered it the bane of my 15 year-old existence. But now, I've found use for it: It is my proverbial ""quiet place."" 

----

Other things: Classes are solid, and I finally finished In Cold Blood over the three-day weekend. (Yeah, so much for finishing it over Christmas break - things happen, or don't happen, more appropriately). It is, again, the finest example of English language known to me. If writing is meant to assist a reader in traversing over the rocky terrain of plot, the standard writer offers a rudimentary set of tools: a walking stick, possibly a pack mule if lucky. Capote offers a <i>Segway</i>. How he has crafted such a device is beyond me, and how it functions over such hostile turf is even more a mystery; but he has done it, and it works splendidly. It's a Segway, plain and simple. 

I bought a handful of books from the library ($.50 per book sale!) at the start of break, and I'm likely going to read Walden, Candide, or a collection of Hemmingway short stories next. I'm thinking the short stories are a more favorable avenue at this point, as I'll probably soon actually have to start reading for, you know, classes."

2006 on the whole, in length and categorized according to livejournal survey regulations:
<lj-cut text=""Livejournal Retrospective: '06 Edition"">
1. What did you do in 2005 that you'd never done before?
Work a job. Attend a second year of college. Attend a music festival for the second time. Grasp at straws to find new things I've done in 2006 to list on a perfunctory livejournal survey.

2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?
I didn't grow my hair out; that was my prior ambition, and it was probably not a good one to follow. Long hair - and I mean of the shiny and resplendent variety - is tough to grow and preserve. I now have the expensive hair care products to successfully grow it out, but I'm lacking my old drive. I may still do it, but I lack the commitment to transform it into a New Years' Resolution for the year. Resolutions for this year: Get act together and get published somewhere, find internship for summer, develop semblance of spine when concerning writing. 

3. Did anyone close to you give birth?
Nope.

4. Did anyone close to you die?
No.

5. What countries did you visit?
None. I've had an unadventurous year. 

6. What would you like to have in 2007 that you lacked in 2006?
Legitimate writing experience.

7. What date from 2006 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?
September 18, 2006: Eve of Mountain Goats show in Kalamazoo. I'm not saying this because it was the most significant date in my year - it probably wasn't. But for some odd reason, partially because I pitched it to every human being in my vicinity for nearly a month straight to no avail, I cannot forget the date. That said, it was still an awesome show and night, and I'd really ought to see more shows at Kraftbrau. 

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?
4.0 for the fall 06 semester and being personally exempt from my history final by my history professor, in form of an email containing the exact phrasing, ""I only wish CMU had more students of your quality."" Blueprint for success: Show up to class an average of five to ten minutes late daily on account of being too lazy to carry your history notebook to your class immediately beforehand, thus forcing you to stop by your dorm room when you really haven't the time; double success points if you walk to the drinking fountain on the opposite end of the hall when your mouth is only the slightest bit dry, or if you take the long way when walking from any point A to any point B.

9. What was your biggest failure?
I've none individually devastating, only innumerable smaller ones; I could be melodramatic and call 2006 entirely a big mistake, but I'm not melodramatic, and that's not how I roll.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?
I passed out twice without cause, one time into a salad bar. Note to fellow anemics: If you feel a bit faint, to the point that your sensation may soon become your action, <i>stay the fuck away from the salad bar</i>. You may believe you can stabilize yourself, keep your posture and dignity in tact; you can not. It is pointy and will only hurt your head. 

11. What was the best thing you bought?
Pitchfork tickets. Any TiGi hair product. Not my copy of Destroyer's Rubies, which I'd bought from Pitchfork's merch tent, that got a big fucking dent right in the fucking middle of ""Priest's Knees"", forcing me to revert to using my ancient burnt copy, which has somehow managed to better avoid scratches than my newer legit copy. 

12. Whose behavior merited celebration?
John Hartman's, which was cynical yet effective in a way that convinced me that CMU was more than a decent bargain, and that my attendance has, or at least should have, roots extending beyond my laziness toward college applications my senior year of high school. 

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?
John Vanderslice's. What's the deal, man? I emailed you, you forwarded it to your booking agent, he emailed me back, I got excited; then you announce a European tour for the entire fall? I am heartbroken. NOTICE: To be a serious contender for my number 12 answer in next year's survey, come to CMU this Spring!

14. Where did most of your money go?
Tuition and room and board! Woohoo!

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?
Pitchfork. Seeing the Mountain Goats a second time.

16. What song will always remind you of 2006?
Destroyer - Basically Any Track off of Rubies

17. Compared to this time last year, are you:
i. happier or sadder? I'm having challenging time answering this question. Last year I wasn't necessarily spectacular, but I was entirely dismal, either; this year, I've become more jaded and cynical than I'd ever predicted, but at the same time, I've come to gradually accept my admittedly lackluster position in life, a bittersweet resignation that is far more bitter than sweet. But acceptance, even of something awful, is still satisfying; thus, I've no concrete answer, and I've wasted many words that could have gone to better uses.
ii. thinner or fatter? Thinner. Last year: 140. This year: Somewhere between 130 and 135. 
iii. richer or poorer? Surprisingly richer. Well, immediately so; I've plunged further into debt (duh), courtesy of federal loans and tuition fees, but I don't have to pay those for another two and a half years. My bank account is currently higher than it was last year, and while I know I will eventually be in a world of financial hurt, that world is not today's world - today's world  comprises me buying DVDs and digital cameras and effeminate hair products. 

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?
Writing and reading. Oh, and playing Resident Evil 4, which my roommate has beaten not once, but <i>twice</i> before I've as much as gotten past the second area. 

19. What do you wish you'd done less of?
Partaking in depressive binges in which I devised new and ingenuous ways to belittle myself. Driving to malls.

20. How will you be spending Christmas?
Spent with my family in Arizona at the cost of ditching my immediate family in Michigan. To be fair, my aunt and uncle have a more impressive Christmas display - the tree is larger and more radiant, and the meal contains more courses. I also saw my cousins and aunt and uncle whom I hadn't seen since, God, like a year ago? Some absurd amount of time like that. Christmas night was spent with my cousins and a couple of their friends; we went to AMC, which is even more ridiculously highly priced in Arizona than it is here ($8.50 for a student ticket), and saw Black Christmas, a continuation of the week's Christmas horror movie flavor. 

22. Did you fall in love in 2006?
n/a

23. How many one-night stands?
None.

24. What was your favorite TV program?
Curb Your Enthusiasm, the DVDs of which entertained me when I was either feeling awful or not feeling like doing work.

25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?
Nah.

26. What was the best book you read?
The first section of In Cold Blood, which I damned well intend to finish by break's end. Truman Capote is simply the most effective writer I've ever read, and I cannot stress enough the purity of his sentence structure. His subjects, verbs, and direct objects align in ways akin to the sun, moon, and Earth during a solar eclipse; comparatively, my writing appears as a series of primitive tribal incantations to harness such cosmic power.

27. What was your greatest musical discovery?
Destroyer. A more thorough appreciation for the Mountain Goats.

28. What did you want and get?
A worthy successor to last summer's Intonation festival. A shred of direction within my life.

29. What did you want and not get?
More shreds of direction within my life; one shred is not sufficient.

30. What was your favorite film of this year?
You know, every other year I've had a clear choice in my mind, but this time I'm drawing a blank. I haven't seen The Departed, which I've heard touted as the year's best, nor can I recall a particular movie that stood above the rest. Not that they were all bad - in fact, my memory could be to blame for my indecisiveness, not the industry. 

31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?
I went to class, encountered a spider in the shower, hopelessly attempted to kill it using half-ply dorm toilet paper which disintegrated on touch, and eventually prevailed after drying my hands for a few seconds. Having passed what was evidently a rite of passage to become 19, I spent the rest of my day lounging around, eating dinner at the fancy cafeteria, and watching some special on the History Channel for a class. I also received brownies.

32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?
Procuring some type of internship for the summer; not that it's currently a lost cause or anything, and I'm still damned well going to try, but <i>oh</i> that sense of security sounds good.

33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2006?
Pretentious hipster.

34. What kept you sane?
Curb Your Enthusiasm DVDs, concerts.

35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?
Once again, Gustav Ejstes, for admirable hair growth and control.

36. What political issue stirred you the most?
Ha ha, dove hunting. Close second: Bob Barker Should Host the Price is Right until the Day He Dies. 

37. Who did you miss?
I've managed to keep in decent contact with most everybody I once knew or cared to know. But if you feel you are the category of 'cared to know' and do not believe you are in decent enough contact, please let me know.

38. Who was the best new person you met?
Handfuls of new people at school, John Vanderslice.

39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2006.
""No Children"" live is the single most cathartic experience on the planet - singing along transforms lungs into biological stress balls squeezed to the point of nearly rupturing. 

40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.

""and when somebody asks if I'm okay
I don't know what to say.""

- The Mountain Goats, ""Wild Sage""

Points of clarification and places in which I feel the survey did not adequately survey: I think I referred to my life as ""lackluster"" or something to that effect. It is hard for me to think of an adjective expressing a lukewarm feeling without effecting some sort of stupid negative connotation - forget the connotation. I don't mean it in a wholly negative way; just by widespread notions of satisfying living, which heavily emphasize love and intimacy and all sorts of warm and fuzzy things as necessary to happiness, I'm, simply put, lacking in that form of luster. My personality is caustic, fickle, and ripe in attributes to which I've attributed my overwhelming undesirability - I've little to offer, so I don't. 

That is not to say I've a bleak outlook toward everything. I still like to believe I've something to offer as a writer, and partially out of compensation I will be forced to become a career-oriented personality. I feel I've developed as a writer over the past year, crafting some foundation for a distinctive and effective style. I intend to continue to improve, and I hope someday this improvement culminates into something; it may not, but I'll abandon that hope in a later year. 

2006 has, in essence, been a year of unavoidable self-evaluation. I feel I've thoroughly evaluated, and though the evaluation was occasionally taxing, I've a decent understanding of where I stand and what I'm decent at. ""Lackluster"" is, admittedly, considered an unfavorable word. It describes something which is not shiny, and most people enjoy exclusively that which is shiny; I'm conditioned to be displeased with that which is not shiny, but I'm coming to accept it as bearable.

So here's to 2007 and all its pleasantries.
</lj-cut>

2007, in review to date:

Absolutely fine until I tasted the oatmeal I'd bought a couple days back. I was under the impression, because Meijer only carried Reduced Sugar and an inconspicuous Weight Control variety, that Weight Control was standard oatmeal remarketed to stress its healthy attributes. It touted many grams of fiber and protein, the likes of which I apparently need within my body to live a healthy lifestyle.

Good God was I wrong. Weight Control oatmeal is not standard oatmeal. The additional protein and fiber, which I had originally believed to be the standard levels, originate from a metallic rod which is ground over the oat flakes during production. I've licked metal poles as a child - never before have they carried a tinge of cinnamon, but I still don't enjoy their flavor. What the fuck was wrong with normal Oatmeal, Quaker? And why don't you force Meijer to carry it? 

This shit is awful, and I have 9 more packs of it. For weight control, I've sacrificed taste bud control."

David Berman being, for the unhip, the lead dude of the Silver Jews and writer of instant lyrical classics such as,

""a robot walks into a bar
orders a drink
lays down a bill
the bartender says, 'hey, we don't serve robots'
and the robot says, 'oh, but someday you will'""

""we're like plug in reindeer
Whose cords can't stretch far enough to fly""

""Marry me and leave Kentucky
Come to Tennessee
'Cause you're the only ten I see
You're the only ten I see""

""I'm like a rabbit freezing on a star""

""And I wanna be like water if I can
'Cause water doesn't give a damn
Water doesn't give a damn""

And that is just a taste of the poetic beauty contained within its pages! I've recently been both discovering and rediscovering my love for Berman's lyrics, through listening to albums both new and old to me; I'd only previously heard American Water and The Natural Bridge, and I'm just now hearing the others. His lyrics are simple, sharp and thoroughly convoluted, creating a world familiar in a way never previously considered - a bizarre, lazy day's Twilight Zone.

So who wants to buy this for me? Hmm?"

"event","I went to Kalamazoo to shoot pictures of the city mall's Santa, and to hang with people with whom I hadn't yet hung in their collegiate environment. 

(For those who don't know me personally or who do not frequently speak to me in great length: I'm working on my photojournalism photo story/essay - most likely essay because it's mildly easier for me - and I'd foolishly chosen to shoot a feature on mall Santas, despite the fact that, well, we have <i>no malls</i> in or near Mt. Pleasant. I make awful decisions, and I endorsed this one for all its foolishness.)

As for the former, I failed miserably. Well, slightly miserably; it was far from the raging, get-entire-project-done-within-a-week-before-due-date weekend for which I'd hoped. For starters, I didn't even start as early as I'd wanted. Thanks to a debilitating snow/ice/hell-fury storm the previous night, Friday was, in its entirety, inhospitable for photographing Santa Clauses, or at least inhospitable to the extent that my laziness took over and said, enough with that, you're going to sit in pajamas and play Nick's copy of Starfox 64 and rip Peter's high score a new one. 

Once I'd ripped said high score said new one, I did eventually brave the elements. Nick and I walked to my car, conveniently parked a mile or so off-campus at some townhouse lot that's not technically free but is poorly supervised, and freed it from its icy casing. The wind was not as ferociously biting as I'd expected, and feeling in my appendages was surprisingly well-maintained. 

Next day: I woke up, lounged about for much longer than I should have, ate breakfast, went to the mall - determined to take at least a hundred photos of Christmas cheer. Well, the Christmas cheer was present, but capturing it was forbidden. I talked to the mall's marketing dude, who is for whatever reason in charge of who is able to photograph what, and he said, while I was able to photograph the Santa, I couldn't photograph him at work because of the dicey nature of photographing children who may have irate parents, and who require proper paperwork to legally photograph - or something. I obliged to his demands and sought a new, experimental (okay, perhaps 'experimental' isn't the best word - how about the more complex adjective of 'desperate but opportunistic'?) shoot: Santa behind the scenes, taking off his outfit and becoming a real human being who rides home in a car and not a majestic flying sleigh. 

The guy actually said yes, and I scheduled a 7PM Sunday appointment with the people working Santa's booth. It was only Saturday afternoon, and I'd managed to procrastinate my project for the entire weekend, most of which hadn't yet occurred. A combination of guilt and pride dropped in my gut, nicely complemented by the mall's generous assortment of free samples for lots of delicious things I'll never actually buy.

So this left me with part of the weekend wasted, and the remainder begging to be wasted. I drove back to Nick's dorm, with clear skies and sunbeams that pierced the snow, melting and threatening to evaporate the snowflakes. I returned, and just as the mall's marketing mogul had denied me photographs, cosmic social balance denied us absolutely <i>anything</i> to do.

It's not fair to discredit the entire weekend, however. A few of us did successfully saunter about downtown Kalamazoo, and I did meet a handful of happening people I'd never met otherwise. It was misfortune beyond anybody's control that dampened the weekend - a combination of inclement weather and a waning semester's zeal contributed to the nothingness. To demonstrate: After wandering about downtown, the lot of us considered renting a movie, and I recommended Good Burger (the Kenan and Kel masterpiece of the 90's), fully expecting somebody's good sense to speak up and shoot down my idea. Ten minutes and one trip to the video store later, we returned to Nick's room, Good Burger DVD in hand. I don't remember the specific course of events, but I know that because it ended with a copy of Good Burger within our midst, something went atrociously wrong. I'm going to blame it on the coffee we had at a downtown cafe - it hindered our inhibition for long enough that we, in espresso stupor, rented fucking <i>Good Burger</i> for $2.50. When we came to our senses in Nick's room, it was like finding a dead hooker on the floor and blood on our hands; the DVD was on the desk, and the receipt was in Nick's hands. 

Ugh.

But, to be technical, I still did hang with many people. But this hanging was more comparable to hanging on, say, a pull-up bar; I wanted the monkey bars, you know? 

That said, I'd still consider this weekend decent, if not good. In the end, at least. This afternoon, Nick, Chris, Chris's rooommate, and I went to this bagel joint called Big Apple Bagels. I'm an outspoken bagel critic; anybody who's had a first-hour high-school class with me could vouch for this. So know when I say this, I do not mean it lightly - Big Apple Bagels has the single most plush, and therefore delicious, bagels I've ever eaten. I had a Swiss melt bagel, and I don't even think I really <i>like</i> Swiss melt shit. It was still one of the best bagels ever ingested by me.

Also, they, in a recipe undoubtedly divinely revealed to them via burning bush, carry a variety of muffin types, many of which combine normally irresistible muffin flavors with cheesecake. I love cheesecake, and I love muffins; but never did I think I would eat the two simultaneously. 

The Santa shoot went surprisingly well, as well. The actor who played Santa was kinder than I'd expected - I'd assumed after a full day of jolliness, his spirits would be shot. But he was, in fact, an affable guy as well as a festive Santa. He was an older man, complete with legit, and awesome, Santa beard. This was his <b>28th</b> year working as a Santa, so I also had one of the most venerable holiday icons. I shot pictures of him in the outfit, out of the outfit, and everything in between. 

We both had a considerable distance to drive, and Kalamazoo had been and wasn't going to stop snowing. I finished the photoshoot within half an hour, taking only about 40-something pictures, bringing my picture grand total to 70ish/200. We went our separate ways, bid each other farewell - and this is what got me. Right before we'd split off in opposite directions in the parking lot, the Santa yelled, quite professionally, ""And you have a very Merry Christmas!"" 

I don't think I've ever experienced a more potent seasonal greeting, or in this case farewell. This man has been a mall Santa for 28 years - he is, more or less, a Christmas authority, and I managed to earn his good wishes. 

I replied a, ""you too!"" with the slight stutter of Fred Flinstone in the Christmas Special in which he was wished a Merry Christmas by Santa himself, whom he'd met for some seemingly hapless reason. Like Fred, misfortune had led me to Santa; and like Fred, Santa's blessing afforded me a sense of closure and calm. 

Notable difference: This episode has a part two in which Fred needs to get his photojournalism shit together within a week, though he really, really doesn't want to do so."

"event","And bear with me, because I <i>know</i> the real semester half-way point for most colleges, including my own, was a few weeks ago. Consider my usual updating schedule, which is about monthly at best: Imagine my entries as a monthly publication, which you were generous enough to purchase to help some asshole middle-schooler's fundraiser, and which unfortunately arrives on your doorstep every month, loaded with shit you'd rather not read but might if you're bored enough to do so. Then, timeliness is no longer an issue - I could write something on hot gifts for Christmas 2002, and the level of disinterest would remain the same. But, given the proper circumstances of nothing on TV and youtube's server being down, you might become transfixed. If you are still reading this paragraph, that is precisely what has just happened. 

So I'm going to share a few words about my semester at its half-way point.

I can say, for one of the first times in nearly <i>all</i> of history, that I have not begun to hate any of my classes. This is shocking because, well, let's retrace my pattern of burgeoning loathing, starting with freshman year of high school:

<b>9th grade</b> - Campus band, what the fuck? Didn't we play this song in 7th grade? 
<b>10th grade</b> - Spanish I, during which I was surrounded by freshmen. As a 10th grader who is by nature thrilled to no longer be a freshmen, this can have one of two consequences: A false feeling of superiority, the <b>ideal</b> for any high-schooler, or a level of self-deprecation unbeknownst to anyone but a sophomore who is consistently out-cooled by a bunch of freshmen. I didn't know anybody going into the class, and introductions were not Brian of yore's forte; therefore, the latter appropriately described my state during the school year. But that wasn't the real reason I hated the class; I just really, really didn't like learning Spanish. Honorable Mention: Chem, for assignments which were as repetitive and redundant as this statement itself.
<b>11th grade</b> - It's harder for me to pinpoint a disliked course this year. Econ - although do not get me wrong, I loved and still love Mr. Devine like any decent human being - became tiring at more than one point, both physiologically (<i>The Other 90</i>, anybody?) and mentally. 
<b>12th grade</b> - Calculus got ridiculous, but Mr. Block, who was and still is <i>the shit</i>, and my awesome class more than made up for it. Symphony band, on the other hand, became the target of my fervent hatred. 
<b>1st College Semester</b> - ""Literature in Film,"" in which we watched such literary masterpieces as <i>The Notebook</i> and <i>Because of Winn Dixie</i>, and ignored, you know, <i>Jaws</i> or <i>The Godfather</i>. Also, I'm still bitter about my final, in which I received no credit for my plot summary of <i>Fiddler of the Roof</i> because it was too detailed. This got me an A- in the class. I received full credit on all the analysis portions, but I'll never forget, and never stop repeating, that I could have had an A if I had just described the movie as ""a bunch of Jews in some village who get hardcore fucked over."" And let's not forget the class's time, conveniently located between 4 and 7 - precisely placed over dinner hours!
<b>2nd College Semester</b> - Okay, I started losing interest in sign language. This was detrimental mainly because my teacher taught the class entirely in sign, so as I gradually became less interested in the class, I started drastically falling behind on signs, as signs I didn't know would snowball into mysterious signs she would teach using aforementioned unknown signs; basically, I ended up thinking things such as ""open"" meant ""potato chip."" That's the bottom-line here. 

But this semester: Nothing! I've gone long enough to confidently say that all of my classes are, for the first time in history, at least moderately satisfying. Sure, Photojournalism isn't exactly my cup of tea - I'm not nor will I ever be an ardent fan of taking photographs, but I don't hate completing the assignments. At worst, I feel indifferent. At best, I feel a mild sense of relief, because for one of the only times in my life I do not need to rely on words to adequately describe a scene; I can simply say, ""here,"" and that's it. No adjectives, no nouns, no verbs. The only simile I could ever need to construct with a photograph is, ""it looked <i>like</i> this."" 

I am, however, pretty fucked on the next project. I need to take 35 shots of two of the following by Monday: Spot News, General News, Feature, Sports Action, Sports Feature. 

I have as of now taken 35 shots of none of the following: Spot News, General News, Feature, Sports Action, Sports Feature.

In a town like Mt. Pleasant, I'm not even sure if I can <i>find</i> two of those categories by Monday. That alone is a problem. The additional problem - the thorn in my side after being impaled through the chest - is that even if I can find something to photograph, that doesn't necessarily mean I <i>can</i> photograph it. I lack the necessary equipment to shoot in anything less than borderline-terrific lighting. Numerous indoor events - including volleyball, basketball and countless other indoor sports occurring this weekend - would be nigh-impossible for me to capture. And as for outdoor events, it's now cold and daylight is severely reduced by Daylight Savings Time. These two factors, like many others, work against my favor.

I even tried to photograph an outdoor intramural flag football game last Wednesday night. The game started at 5, which meant it actually started around 5:10, and before the first quarter was over I was almost out of sunlight and feeling in my fingers. I was getting lousy shots, anyway. But I do feel a pang of regret in that I talked to some of the players and told them my journalistic intent. When they said, ""yeah, sure,"" they confided within me a certain level of trust - trust which I have violated by leaving the game. The media has through my actions abandoned them, and now no-one will know the plight of the flag football player: The freedom of running across the field, naked of professional football's equipment. The sensation of being tackled by that overly aggressive asshole on the other team who totally could have just grabbed the flag. These stories will forever remain untold. To the people I have rendered voiceless: Sorry, dudes, but it was fuckin' cold.

Anyway, if you know of anything exciting happening within driving distance, please, for the love of God, let me know. By Sunday night, I will be in either total panic or total catharsis: Help me achieve the latter, please.

As for my other classes, I feel I should make special note of my Journalism 202 professor, John Hartman. I'll expound on his significance at the end of the semester once I've fully comprehended it, but I feel this single-sentence description is necessary for the time being: John Hartman is, more or less, the reassurance I needed to stay at Central, and his presence within the journalism department instills within me enthusiasm toward the program, strong enough to diminish my unbearable contempt toward Mt. Pleasant's desolate state. That's the basic gist of it, at least. I'll have a more professional version at semester's end, which will most likely see an update at the end of January. 

I'm going to order cheesebread now.
UPDATE: The Muncherie, despite allegedly being open until 1, did not answer my phone call at 12:30. Jerks!"

"event","Good God, I don't think I've updated twice in one week in over six months. I'm not entirely sure if quizzes count as entries, since most of my work has been arranged in a convenient template, but look at this! I have two entries on your friends page! And that's right, <b>two</b> entries - not just one very long one!

~~~~~~~~~~RED~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Closest red thing to you? I'm trying to gauge if it's the red text on my BiC Pencil box or my red photojournalism folder; both seem equidistant, and I can't quite discern which one is slightly closer. This question cannot be answered.
2. Have you ever fallen down the stairs? I don't believe so, although I'm sure I have.
3. Last thing to make you angry? Probably the design of my floor's 'approved' t-shirt, which contained the grammatical atrocity, ""You may not know us but, we're kind of a big deal!""
4. Are you a fan of romance? Not in the slightest.
3. Do you like mysterious things? <i>Maybe.</i>
4. Favorite type of chocolate? Milk or white. Dark is too intense and chocolatey for me.
5. Ever met any royalty? Only the Swedish president, or at least a dude who must have been some level of Swedish authority based on the fact that he was fucking able to sing along, at last June's Dungen show.
6. Are you creative? Not nearly enough.
7. Are you lonely? In many ways yes. But not nearly as much as I will be in ten years, which will still not be nearly as much as I will be in twenty years; and so on and so forth. I am able to recognize greener grass when I see it, even if that grass is only yellow-brown instead of brown.

~~~~~~~~~~~~YELLOW~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Closest yellow thing to you? CLEAR WINNER: Yellow portion of BiC pencil box.
2. The happiest time[s] of your life? The brief moment during which I was front-row at the Mountain Goats show and gave Peter Hughes a direct thumbs-up. He responded with a grin and nod. It was a very fulfilling transaction of sentiments.
3. Favorite holiday? Labor Day: It embodies everything I am.
4. Are you a coward? A little, yeah. I can be verbally aggressive every now and then, and it can cause me to make poor decisions that end in things like failing introductory honors class, but I'm almost never physically aggressive. This may or may not have something to do with my 130 pound status.
5. Do you burn or tan? Burn. But not as badly as I once did; now my skin absorbs some level of pigmentation, albeit not enough to qualify me as anything other than 'shades of ghastly.'
6. Do you want children? No.
7. What makes you feel warm and safe? Nothing in particular.

~~~~~~~~~~~~BLUE~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Closest blue thing to you? iPod - wait, scratch that. I just turned up the volume on my laptop, so my answer is now Dell's lovely illumination of the volume key.
2. Are you good at calming people down? Not at all.
3. Do you like the sea? Yes. I would like to see it sometime - far out in it, not just on some Californian beach. Preferably not shipwrecked.
4. What was the last thing that made you cry? I haven't legitimately cried in ages, and my memory does not extend back ages.
5. Are you a logical thinker? Destructively so.
6. Can you sleep easily? Fairly.
7. Do you prefer the beach or the woods? Probably the woods. Beaches are neat and everything, but I'm terrible at volleyball.

~~~~~~~~~~~~PINK~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Closest pink thing to you? God. I literally cannot see anything pink. I think part of my bag of expired bagels (one left, going in garbage soon) has a pinkish-maroon swirl-design on the bag, but I'm not sure if pinkish-maroon qualifies; however, it is the best I can do.
2. Do you like sweet things? Yes, but I had Coldstone last night, so I'm set on sweets for a while.
3. Like play-fighting? No.
4. Are you sensitive? Haha.
5. Do you like punk music? Bits and pieces.
6. What is your favorite flower? Whichever's aroma is synthesized by my admittedly extremely effeminate haircare products.
7. Does someone have a crush on you? n/a

~~~~~~~~~~~~ORANGE~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Closest orange thing to you? The BiC pencil box shifts between shades of yellow and orange.
2. Do you like to burn things? On occasion.
3. Dress up for Halloween? I haven't in a long while. Band used to mandate a costume, and once I was done with band I no longer had any pressure to scrape together an outfit. 
4. Are you usually a warm-hearted person? No, I have developed callousness to most scenarios, working on all. 
6. Do you prefer the single life or the security of a relationship? n/a
7. What would your superpower be? I'd love for something cool like telekinesis or the ability to light shit on fire, but I'd probably wind up with something similar to that stupid porcupine kid from X-3. 

~~~~~~~WHITE~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Closest white thing to you? Flurry of papers on desk.
2. Would you say you're innocent? Not very.
3. Always try to keep the peace? Only when the peace should be kept.
4. How do you imagine your wedding? n/a
5. Do you like to play in the snow? Sometimes.
6. Are you afraid of going to the doctors or dentist? Doctors. Dentists have a number of painful procedures under their command, but doctors - by far - possess many more diabolical techniques. As somebody who suffers from an intestinal illness, I can tell you this for fact.
7. Do you have Attention Deficit Disorder (A.D.D)? Nope.

~~~~~~~~~~~~BLACK~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Closest thing to you that is black? Pajama pants.
2. Ever enjoy hurting people? Nope.
3. Are you sophisticated or silly? I used to be sillier than I am now, and I will never possess the intellect to be sophisticated; so, right now, I fall in an irritating middle-ground.
4. Would you like to travel in space? Yes, only under the condition that I could blare David Bowie on the way up.
5. Do you have a lot of secrets? Not really - at least nothing interesting.
6. What is your favorite color(s)? Green or blue.
7. Does the color you wear affect your mood? Yes. I'm currently stuck wearing a lame free t-shirt from the SBX (student book exchange), and it makes me feel like a chump."

"event","It has been a long time since my last update.

In this time I have turned 19 and fainted in a coffee shop, most notably. But odds are you've heard these stories plenty of times, and even if you haven't, I've told them far beyond my heart's content. I don't really want to reiterate either of them, but I know a few people might be reading this and wondering about these two occasions and how they came to be; for the sake of both possible curiosity and my laziness, I'm going to fabricate a narrative in which both of these events occur simultaneously. None of the following is true, but it should satisfy anybody's desire for backstory on my turning 19 and fainting in a coffee shop:

One day, I was born. 19 years later, I turned 19. On this day I was lavished with many splendid gifts, but there was one thing I did not receive: Sufficient iron in my blood supply. When I went to see a local band play some coffee shop, the ground - which I had intended to remain perpendicular to my body the entire evening - suddenly and abruptly became parallel to my spinal column. This transition was quick and painful.

That paragraph is my last month reduced to a single instance. The unfortunate reality is that that paragraph, which should contain enough for an interesting half-day, has been diluted over the past thirty; my life is exceptionally un-thrilling.

That said, I need to soon start taking considerable steps to add dynamics to my life, and this isn't simply to shake the overwhelming self-loathing that occurs with absolute stagnancy - it's journalism internship application season! This places me in an interesting position: For one, I have no experience. I am competing against countless other students, many of whom have this coveted 'experience,' for internships. This is a severe disadvantage for me.

Also, I need to actually keep track of the signup sheets. I'm pretty sure I missed a couple internships yesterday, and I'd like to not squander another opportunity to get disdainfully rejected. Tomorrow I'm going to head up to fourth floor and see what publications are coming when, and consider just HOW badly they'd kick me to the curb. It feels like it's been ages since my last good rejection; sure, I guess you could count being denied the Trout Hall Deskie position as 'rejection,' but that was just lacking a certain <i>zeal</i>. Trout sent me all kinds of letters, even one saying I didn't get the job - and not only that, but they phrased it in the least demeaning way possible! That's NOT what job rejection is all about. I'm talking mid-May/early-June job-hunting rejection. I don't want phone calls, I don't want recognition, I don't want to be told I did a good job - I want the cold shoulder. I want to follow-up on the interview, meet a half an hour of telephone wait time, and have the editor holding back expletives directed toward me. I want to be so harshly spurned that, by the end of this, I question my major and life direction and have an insuperable life crisis. 

Of course, if I actually land an internship, I'll be fine with that too.

This also means I should probably exhume my CM-Life application from the disorderly array of papers on my desk, but I'll get to that later."

"event","The Mountain Goats show was, to be frank, fucking phenomenal. The caliber of 'fucking' I am not yet sure, and somewhere within this livejournal cut I will attempt to figure that out.

<lj-cut text=""The Mountain Goats""><img src=""http://static.pitchforkmedia.com/images/image/21737.x-header-mountaingoats.gif?"">

I've read dozens of live reviews comparing the Mountain Goats live show to a religious experience.

I'm not entirely sure I agree with those comparisons.

Yes, a Mountain Goats show does have at least as much energy as a Southern Baptist service. Kraftbrau was as radiant as any chapel on a Sunday Morning, and John Darnielle played the part of a revered priest, with the audience clinging to his every word. But whereas a religious experience would typically imply sort of spiritual revelation, some sort of adoration for a higher-power that is all good and assures the world is all good; John Darnielle wishes to create no such revelations. A Mountain Goats song is a brilliantly crafted reflection on the phenomena within life and nothing more. It can be cathartic, harrowing, or even slightly absurd, but not once does John attempt to offer any solution to life's woes. John merely states them, often in form of narrative involving fictional characters, with an impeccable sense for detail, and creates scenarios that are rarely anything less than remarkable. He adroitly highlights his characters, their emotions and their plights; and in doing so frequently constructs elaborate blueprints of the human spirit at its worst.

But what to do with these blueprints?

Read them. Review them. Study them. Learn from them. But again, nothing is really presented to be <i>learned</i>. The only thing to be gained, and this is key, is an understanding of the fucked-up tendencies of the world around us. Love goes sour, shit goes awry; and in these situations there is often little more to do than acknowledge that love has gone sour or that shit has gone awry. And while John does frequently hint at his characters taking action or planning to take action, the key elements to his lyrics are still observational. They create worlds in which any listener can become a B-Grade actor, placing himself in the same scenario, looking around and saying, more or less, 'well, fuck.' If acceptance is the first step to overcoming a crisis, John focuses primarily on starting this process. This works to create a feeling of internal progression, and from there comes satisfaction and fulfillment. But there is no revelation or sage advice, nor is there a promise of better days ahead - the only thing promised is that there will be days ahead, but what will come out of them is uncertain and, you know, possibly bad. It is the embracement of the tumultuous nature of life and the tenacity of people in and of themselves, and this, I believe, is more immediate and visceral than a religious experience. A Mountain Goats show is not life-changing, but rather life-affirming.

Of course, I've only now discussed how terrific the Mountain Goats are in general, and not how terrific they are as a live act in particular. I touted them as my favorite band at Pitchfork this summer, and I still firmly stand by that statement. I also proposed that they may be the best live act touring today, and while that may have been slightly brash, especially against more bombastic acts such as Broken Social Scene or the Arcade Fire, they're certainly a wholly distinct experience. Again, singing along with John is a better therapeutic exercise than lying on any couch. If part of the joy of a Mountain Goats song comes from becoming one of his characters, the entire night could be best described as a 250-person, simultaneous audition for about twenty different movies. John was, of course, by and far the best one there, and were Krafbrau a talent agency, he would have easily gotten the part every time; but that didn't deter any of us hopefuls, who were too caught up in our audition to care about anything else.

I've affectionately described John's voice as ""piercing,"" and I think that quality becomes even more apparent live. Again, this is not in a bad way (I don't think I could ever stomach casting a negative adjective John's way); it's a statement of prominence. John's voice has a timbre that is not only unique and instantly recognizable, but perfectly complementary to his lyric-centric music. He is able to, regardless of how hard he's pounding his acoustic guitar, send his words slicing mercilessly through his music and into the listener's ears; or, in the case of some of his slower work, leave it lightly dangling above gentle strumming. Yeah, he's not always perfectly in tune, and piercing is, again, not a word many people associate fondly with music; but his fervor, to me, is so perfectly complemented by this bizarre voice that I can't help but label John Darnielle as my favorite voice in all of music.

Of course, as a Mountain Goats show, it was slightly bittersweet. I got to hear nearly 20 songs I love, and was unable to hear nearly 380 songs I also love. But it's impossible to complain about a Mountain Goats setlist. It would be the musical equivalent of being a rich, spoiled 8 year-old on Christmas who only got three of the trainsets he wanted and only two RC cars. It just seems fucking ridiculous to complain.

My favorite trainsets: ""This Year,"" ""Dance Music,"" ""Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton,"" and, in a surprise move that really caught me off-guard, the song ""Commandante"" from the Devil in the Shortwave EP. I absolutely love that song, and everytime I listened to it I felt there would be no fucking way I'd ever see it live, and that depressed me. But was I ever wrong!

Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention the terrific opening act by the name of Christine Fellows. She was - and this is, I've scientifically decided, the only adequate word to describe her - lovely. She wrote beautiful songs that were poppy yet fragile, and included no less than two songs featuring some hardcore ukulele shredding. She's easily one of my favorite opening acts to date. Also, John Darnielle made clear his love for Christine's music. During one of her songs - and, bear in mind, this is fairly effeminate, girly music - he went out into the crowd and started enthusiastically singing along. He was whipping his head around, which was especially goofy due to his new emo-core hair, belting out the lyrics, and waving his hand around in the air. All in all, he looked like a completely fucking psychotic fan, and that, I feel, was very awesome.

The crowd at the Mountain Goats show was also, for the record, very cool. I was a little uneasy going into it, especially with the established stigma I've noticed in most people about going to concerts by themselves. As somebody who has now done it and wholeheartedly enjoyed it, I have to say that I don't understand this stigma; I guess at maybe some hardcore metal show where everybody wants to be a dick to everybody and it's survival of the fittest, yeah, I wouldn't want to go there alone. But that's not the case with most shows I go to, the Mountain Goats in particular. Everybody at this type of show has the intention of being super-cool to everybody around, and it's easy to get along with people when they wish to be super-cool to you. I also, in a highly improbable sequence of events, met some guy who goes to Central, which really caught me off-guard, because I didn't think the number of Mountain Goats fans at my school broke the double-digits. 

All in all, I would say that the Mountain Goats show was easily one of my favorite nights in recent memory. It was absolutely rejuvenating, and I would say it was exactly what I needed as a remedy to the frequent self-deprecation induced by Mt. Pleasant. I've now developed a two-part system to ascertain that I am, in fact, despite my obtuse detachment and romantic isolationism, a functioning human being, and it goes as follows:

1. I enjoy Jurassic Park
2. I find the Mountain Goats compelling

</lj-cut>

Other, less important things I've done recently:

I found out, earlier today, that I did not get the job at the Trout Hall front desk that I have been pursuing for the past few weeks. There was one opening and ten people being screened for the position; I was not good enough to best the other nine. In my defense, I had my screening the night after the Mountain Goats show, which discombobulated me beyond comprehension and left me feeling incoherent and incapable of counting money. So, to an extent, I could say the Mountain Goats cost me my job. And I would still say that it was more than worth it.

I finished my first photojournalism project. And over the span of 80 pictures, and during my growing contempt for taking pictures, I managed to actually take a few that I'm fairly satisfied with. I've never taken anything more than a couple of snapshots, and I'm sure these are far from profound or even very good, but I feel like showing <i>something</i> for my labors, so fuck it, I'm posting a few of them.

Oh, hey, also: Who's going home for Athens homecoming this year? I'm probably going, and I want more old college friends to be there so we can point at our high school football team and make snide remarks about how bad they are, just like the good ol' days. Everybody should go!"

"event","Dear Everybody Who Decided to Not See the Mountain Goats and Are Therefore Making Me Go By Myself,

You guys are losers.

Sincerely,
Brian

I've never been to a concert on my own before. It'll be odd to not have my usual social buffer, a group of people with whom to discuss meaningless drivel/how awesome that last song was during downtime, but I honestly don't think it will be too bad. It will be an interesting social experiment, at least; I'm not exactly the most extroverted of people, but in the right environment I can feel mildly comfortable around an entirely new set of people. Mild comfort is all I need. And it'll be a taste of what's to come in a few years when I'm done with college and leave this drab mitten state, foraging for some sort of habitat within a city where I will know nobody. Also, and this should go without saying, Mountain Goats fans are amongst the coolest people on the planet. This is a fact I've derived from a combination of the Pitchfork crowd, random commenters on the Peter Hughes livejournal, and my cousin. I'm sure the entire night will be swell, even if I don't know anybody going into it. I just need to look at it from this perspective: The less voice I waste on talking and trivial things like that, the more I'll have for singing. So <i>there.</i>

But the Mountain Goats show, solitary as I will be, is a light at the end of the tunnel, and the tunnel is this weekend's work:

In case you haven't heard, my classes are alright. I've got nothing against any of them, all of my professors seem coherent and intelligent, and, on the whole, the topics seem fairly interesting. All in all, nothing to really bitch about, which is why I haven't made a livejournal post about my classes yet. Everything is nice and unremarkable.

I've just got a good portion of work which has, coincidentally, aligned itself to all be due within the same two-day period. I have a photojournalism project due on Monday, the criteria of which are 80 pictures of various things from various angles and the discovery of the 'joy of photography.' I also have two short articles due for my journalism class, and, granted, they're only 250 words, but they're also the first pieces of writing assigned for the class, and I don't want to totally botch them and cast 'totally fucking retarded' as my first impression on CMU's Journalism department. I've also got a handful of psych and philosophy reading for respective quizzes on the morning after the Mountain Goats show (hooray!).

So I guess it's really not that bad. I can't even make it appear to be that bad. I wrote that last paragraph in the most extravagant manner I could, and even then it still came off sounding like not that big of a deal. I can't even make a mountain out of this molehill; the most I can do is create slightly elevated, rocky terrain.

Oh, and one of my journalism articles is an obituary for myself. No, not a eulogy - that was an art I mastered last year thanks to HON 100B. This is slightly less bullshitty, and it actually serves the purpose of being a basic, introductory objective writing format. An obituary is slightly more elaborate (250 words as opposed to 55) and sheds a little more insight into the person's life. It also typically includes quotes from those who knew the deceased.

You know where this is going.

If I were to die tomorrow - or, more likely, Monday night when I drive back from the Mountain Goats at one in the morning by myself - what would you say to a reputable journalist asking you what you thought of me and my existence? It can be about anything: My passions, my personality, my hair. Whatever strikes your fancy."

"event","And thus nearly four months of recalling and expanding upon the meaning of ""doing absolutely jack shit"" come to a close. This summer wasn't too bad - I had ample time to do nothing, worked a pretty alright job, and banked a decent amount of cash to squander on trivial expenditures over the next semester, placing myself in as bad a financial standing as when I started. But, hey, breaking even is a new record for me - all of last year I spent way more money than I should have, and I didn't even have much to begin with! I consider this to be a summer of progress.

So now I'm getting myself ready for school. And I mean that in the vaguest way possible - this livejournal post, for example, is a vital part of getting myself ready for school. Actually packing shit? Pfft, I can throw that together in the morning. I'm planning on bringing only the barest of necessities up to school with me first trip, meaning toiletries, shit to keep me from dying, and clothes. Maybe a few DVDs and posters, but that's only because I never got around to unpacking them from when I moved out. My laziness has come full circle, and it has now turned into really, really advanced preparation. 

I've already made the concession of planning an ""oh shit, I forgot to bring this, this, and this"" trip right off the bat for a couple weekends down the line. I mean, there's no real use in trying to work around it. It's only going to be a matter of days before I'm sitting in my dorm room, sweating because I forgot a portable fan, and resting my head on my backpack because I forgot to pack a pillow. This will be an interesting couple of days, I think. My current goal is to manage to say ""oh shit"" fewer than a dozen times, but even I admit that's a bit unrealistic. I think I might start taking bets for the number of ""oh shit""s I'll mutter. Closest guess gets a personal call on the phone from me, where I will say ""oh shit"" to you personally as I mooch off my roommate's toothpaste for the third time!

What I think is most interesting about this night is the complete contrast between it and my last night at home a year ago. Last year, my last night in Troy was spent awake until the wee hours of the night, eyes glued open with both the anxiety and anticipation for college - new people, new town, new everything! Everything was neatly packed, and I was raring to go. This year my eyes are being forced open because I need to wait for my laundry to dry, and all excitement has been replaced with apathy and indifference. I've been to Mt. Pleasant for a full year - and, yeah, living around all-new people will be as much a kick as ever (nothing is more exciting than seeing somebody's facebook for the VERY FIRST TIME!!) - but I've also come to the realization that it's Mt. Pleasant. It's boring. I might work to try to fix that this year - maybe getting published, maybe being a little more active, maybe getting my good buddy John Vanderslice to come to visit (hey, he said he'd consider it if I emailed him, even though it was totally brought up as a joke) - but it's basically a more scholarly version of the same listlessness and boredom that permeates my life in Troy. Not that I want to stay in Troy, either. It's more of, when confronted with the prospect of moving back to Mt. Pleasant, my only response is, ""why the fuck not?"" That's more or less become my view on Mt. Pleasant after having both lived there and not lived there respectively: It's not a change for the better, nor is it a change for the worse; but it's a change I want solely because it's some variety of change.

Next topic (and this is very important):

If you ever got around to reading my last behemoth of a post, you'd remember me gushing about how great the Mountain Goats were, how much I love their music, and how I'd topple the ice cream cone of a poor orphan with cancer for a chance to see them again. Well, fortunately for me, I don't even have to touch a single orphan; The Mountain Goats just announced three new tour dates, and one of them is right in Michigan. The Kraftbrau Brewery in Kalamazoo, to be exact. Kraftbrau was the super-awesome place I saw John Vanderslice back in April, and aside from being one of the smallest, most intimate places I've been to, it was also one of the classiest in terms of decor. And also, it's a brewery, so woo, beer!

The show is on Monday, September 18th. Tickets are 12 bucks ahead of time, 18 at the door, and doors open at 8 PM. 

Now, let me say this in the kindest way possible: If you live in Kalamazoo, or live in Mt. Pleasant while my car still has open seats, <b>there is absolutely no excuse for you not to attend this show.</b> I don't care that it's a Monday night, I don't care that you have a Tuesday super-ultra-final-exam-even-though-it's-only-three-weeks-in at 8 in the morning the next day; those are not acceptable reasons to miss The Mountain Goats. 

Anyway, even though it should be unnecessary to say this for everybody who could possibly go, and it should only be a matter of who gets to be one of the lucky few from Mt. Pleasant, let me know if you wanna come along. I'll order you a ticket when I get mine in a couple days. Everybody should come! If you aren't satisfied, well, I'm not worried about wasting your money, because you are a soulless shell of a human being with whom I will no longer be friends.

I guess I'm pretty tired. I was at Pitchfork all weekend, sweating profusely as the sun made its mark on my flesh, and I only got four hours of sleep last night, thanks to the temptation of Super Mario: The Lost Levels in Nick's room. I've also been holed up in a car for about five hours, taking a break only to refill gas and stomach. And, despite listening to several slow, mellow albums on the trip, I got very little sleep in the car; I found myself mostly stuck in the bothersome limbo between fully awake and fully asleep. Were dark circles under eyes as accurate a way of gauging human age as rings in an oak tree, I would be about a thousand years old, nearing my thousand and first birthday.

By all means, I should have gone to bed when I got home. But I had CDs that I bought at the festival to import, posters to safely place in a wrinkle-free location on my desk, and a little unpacking to do. That, combined with the fact that I actually had to <i>start</i> my computer because I shut it off for the weekend (my computer being switched off is a rare occasion that occurs with the same frequency as a total solar eclipse), adding another five seconds to the total time it took me to do shit when I got home, put me in a state where I was no longer truly tired enough to sleep. Rather, I found myself in the same sleep limbo as before; minute after minute began to pass, the time for napping ceasing to be reasonable, and I decided to rough it until I call it an early night tonight.

So that's where that puts me right now. I may not have slept, but I've done the next best thing - ingested perhaps the most sugar-filled substance on the planet: Marshmallow Fruit Loops, a cereal designed by people who firmly believed that standard Fruit Loops, pure sugar with a hint of artificial fruit flavoring, were not sugary enough. Three or four cavities later, I felt like a new man. 

But my mild sugar high, the only thing keeping me fully alert at a time like this, is not the point of this update. I'm here to write about the Pitchfork Music Festival, the reason I was in Chicago in the first place. Though, before I start, I need to once again place a secondary emphasis of this entry on Super Mario: The Lost Levels, the reason I stayed up until 2:30 in the morning with a 7:00 AM wake-up. That game is such a bitch. 

Okay, moving on:

Nate wrote what I would consider a very good guide of Pitchfork in <a href=""http://goestoeleven.livejournal.com"">his journal</a>(I don't know how to do fancy livejournal-to-livejournal links, and I'm certainly not willing to spend the energy, currently a precious commodity, to find out), and I'm hesitant to lauch into a full guide for the sake of sounding repetitious to those who read both of our journals (read: 90% of people who read this). I also know for fact that Dan is working on one. But I can't resist. I'll try to avoid treading the same ground, making the same statements of awesomeivity; ideally, both of our guides will feel fresh to anybody bored enough to read both in their entirety. After all, this is just another drop in what will eventually become an ocean of blog entries on the festival - what can one more hurt?

But I digress. This introduction has gone on long enough.

<lj-cut text=""Pitchfork Music Festival: '06"">
We left our humble abode of Troy at 11 in the morning to set out for the bustling city of Chicago - and, more specifically, it's slightly less bustling suburb of Oak Park, where we were to meet Nick (Nate's roommate), who volunteered his house as a place for us to stay. The trip, consisting of me, Nate, Dan, and Cory all in Cory's 300M, was more or less standard teenager roadtrip fare. A bunch of guys making meaningless conversation, cringing at every gas sign passing by; the usual. Sans a couple of rough spots of traffic - and let's be realistic, what would a road trip be without SOME point to curse profusely at the the jackhole riding the left lane to its very end, despite several signs indicating its terminal state? - we got there without a hitch.  

Then we got to Nick's, which was, and I mean this with as much sincerity as possible for a deadbeat like myself, as nice of a place as we could have ever hoped to stay. First thing's first: I was expecting a place on the floor to crash. That's it. Maybe a pillow and a blanket if his parents were nice. But what they had far exceeded my wildest dreams of places in which I could dream more wild dreams - four beds. One for each of us. As guests. A luxurious guest room, complete with a collection of old-school Nintendo stuff (though, as I found out, that was an accursed vice - damn you, The Lost Levels!). And his parents were tremendously nice and helpful with our complete and utter lack of knowledge of Chicago. I think it's safe to say that, were it not for them, not only would we have paid an absurd amount in hotel fees, but we also would have killed an absurd amount of time trying to figure out train routes to the place. AND they had two big, full boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios - they know how to stock a cupboard.

We arrived around 5 or so their time, so we had a little time to kill in the city for the night. Despite it being muggy as hell and being crammed in the backseat of Cory's car with three other people (we met up with a couple of Nate's other U of M friends around the city), it was an amazing sight. I've never really, truly taken a look around Chicago. The closest I've been was a fruitless, heartbreaking search of Michigan Avenue for a certain famous man's statue a year ago, and that left me with nothing but contempt for the city. This trip managed to turn that contempt into sheer admiration - that city is phenomenal, and particularly pretty at night, when, and I'm convinced they leave on at least a handful of lights in their buildings for show, the buildings illuminate the skyline as a humble moon sits in the backdrop, robbed of its duty of lighting the night sky. We hit up a few major landmarks: This shiny bean-thing, a giant fountain, some harbor with a bunch of boats, and, most importantly of all, this little trough of running water for us to dip our feet in, which was significantly more refreshing than I had anticipated. 

After our brief excursion into the city proper, we returned to the quiet suburb of Oak Park where we ordered some Chicago deep-dish pizza from a legitimate, ritzy pizza chain. Were these the intestines of a lesser man, I would have keeled over from the intensity of the cheese, crust, and sauce; but mustering all my will I managed to down two full slices of the stuff. To give a proper image of the deceptive nature of a stuffed, deep-dish Chicago pizza: Imagine one of my entries, looking sufficiently long enough before clicking on the cuts, and then imagine your first bite as when you click on a cut for the first time - <b>holy fuck</b>. I'm sure the pizza is terribly unhealthy, but I consider part of that unhealthiness off-set by the total work-out I had getting the food down my throat, into my intestines, and, in the grand scheme of things, into the toilet. 

The pizza, of course, knocked me out cold. It wasn't more than a half an hour after I finished my second slice before I was in bed with eyes closed, readying myself for the two intense days ahead. These two days were ridden with amazing music, hip cats, and rockin' merch. 

I saw a grand total of 10 bands over the two days: Hot Machines, Man Man, The Mountain Goats, Destroyer, The Futureheads, Tapes n Tapes, Danielson, The National, Devendra Banhart, and Spoon. I'm tempted to write on them in order of appearance, but that's not quite as much fun - I want to save my most extravagant praise for last. And there are an even 10 bands up there, making the bothersome rock journalist cliche of ranking shit impossible for me to resist. To make up for it, I'll include a shiny picture and mp3 link with each band (and for the concerned, I promise you this is the closest I will ever, ever, ever get to making this an mp3 blog). 

This is the Pitchfork Music Festival, through my eyes, in order of importance:


-----------------------------------------------

<b>10. Hot Machines</b>
<img src=""http://static.flickr.com/15/18741594_e9fe5e32e0_m.jpg"">

Okay, it's not <i>totally</i> fair to include these guys. The only reason I saw them was because they were the first act, I had checked out the merch tent to a suitable extent for the time being, and I was bored. They weren't particularly helpful with solving the last of my complaints - this band did very little for me. What they offered was a smoldering series of chords pounded out through a heavily distorted guitar to some chick's screeching vocals; if the Hot Machine they were referring to was a teapot about to boil over, they did a splendid job of living up to their name. 

Though I don't mean to be too hard on the guys. They weren't absolutely terrible, and while I didn't particularly enjoy their music, I was, on occasion, able to tap my toe along to it. And if you consider them as a relative opener for the vastly superior act of Man Man, they weren't bad by those standards. I've seen some dismal openers, from the deafening Les Os to the awkward Gold in Chains, and the fact that I was able to not cringe the entire time made them alright at what they were doing. After all, Man Man was on that stage a half an hour after their set, and I waited for Man Man the entire time. For the sake of kindness, I'll treat them like an opener; and in that regard, they were satisfactory at getting me ready for the onslaught of way slicker noise that would be Man Man.

Download: Ah, forget it, I don't care enough to dig up an mp3 of this band for you to listen to. If you're a huge fan of all this post-punk hubub, look 'em up yourself.

<b>9. Danielson</b>
<img src=""http://www.sfindie.com/indiefest06/thumbs/danielson.jpg"">

Alright, now we're talking: This is the first of the bands listed that I was very interested in. Danielson's <i>Ships</i> is a fun record: An art-rock explosion, reminding me of what would happen if you mixed one-part Animal Collective and one-part Polyphonic Spree. I'm unfamilair with their prior work, but I know that I like the tracks off <i>Ships</i>, and that's entirely what they delivered to the audience. Combine that with their slick uniforms, the novel fact that the majority of them are related (fun fact to make your friends at the show go 'oooh, aaah'), and you've got yourself a solid, live set. The band brought their eclectic, scatterbrained tunes to life terrifically well. 

The show also offered some of the best hand-clapping of the entire festival, knocking The Futureheads (more on that, obviously, later in the update) show off of its throne as hand-clapping champ. Alright, fair enough, maybe the clapping wasn't as intense as that offered by those charming Brits, but it offered a more interesting mix of clapping. The Futureheads, like most conventional rock shows, stuck to conventional clapping methods of either downbeats or upbeats; Danielson, being the crazy art-rock collective they are, didn't make the effort to define when to do which for us. In fact, they encouraged us to do both, which left one-third of the audience doing downbeats, one-third doing upbeats, and another third, myself included, not sure when the fuck to clap and occasionally just saying fuck it and clapping on the eighth-note. There was, however, a particularly charming time when Dan, Cory, and Nick were doing downbeats while Nate and myself were doing upbeats - never has there been a more powerful audience rhythm section!

All in all, a slick act from a group that must be the highlight of every family reunion.

<b>8. Tapes n Tapes</b>
<img src=""http://www.thespacelab.tv/spaceLAB/Images/theSHOW/TapesNTapes-wide.jpg"">

I'm legitimately afraid to list these guys as number 8. Why, you ask? You never saw the guy announcing them; whereas most other bands had the same, slightly psychotic-but-toned-down-this-year-and-reasonable-now guy bringing them on stage, Tapes n Tapes had a publicist all their own - and he was intimidating. Prior to the show, the standard announcer handed the mic to a very assertive Indian man, who, and I quote, ""[introduced] a band that, if bands had cocks, would have a giant one"" He went on to ascertain our loyalty to the group's massive phallace: He kindly instructed us to, and again I quote, ""Blog about this band. Post mp3's about this band. Fuckin' spread the word. If I catch you not blogging about this group, I will come to your house and kill your dog. And if you don't have a dog, I will hurt the weakest member of your family.""

I have two dogs, making me doubly scared.

Don't get me wrong, crazy Indian announcer man - Tapes n Tapes put on a great set. In fact, every one of these bands, sans Hot Machines, put on some of the best shows I've ever seen. I can't say a single one of my top 9 was a disappointment. Tapes n Tapes churns out some fine, catchy indie rock tunes, and they were great to see live. The one member played a mean tuba, which was a pleasant surprise (I didn't think it was ACTUALLY tuba on the album), and the rest of the band played their parts exquisitely, getting nearly every head nodding and toe tapping. Also, the keyboardist/tubist had the Wrens shirt I just bought a day earlier, so I even felt a personal connection to the guys.

They were good. Seriously. And I'm posting an mp3, meaning that I'm fuckin' spreading the word.

Please don't hurt my dogs.

<b>7. Devendra Banhart</b>
<img src=""http://www.posteverything.com/2004/01/18/5850/1devendrahappy.jpg"">

Man, I wish I could be a hippie. A legitimate, professional hippie in any branch of the arts - be it painting, sculpting, or, in this case, music. Just getting to sit around, looking at shit, finding this shit <i>really</i> awesome, growing my hair out, and drowning myself in a variety of harmful substances; that would be the life. Unfortunately, I'm not remotely talented in any regard, so I have to live my hippie dreams vicariously through Devendra. 

Before I go on, in case you're not familiar with Mr. Banhart, I'd like you to take another good look at that picture. And I mean really look at it: Look at his eyes, his scraggly beard, his goofy grin. Look at it in the way that you would think he would look at a picture. Once you get a grasp of his mindset via that picture, thereby giving finally giving you an understanding of how to stare at the picture in the first place, everything will piece together; you will look at the picture, and you yourself will cave in to giving a goofy, ecstatic grin. 

It's not challenging to imagine Devendra as an iconic figure of some freak-folk revivalist movement. He's got the personality for it, his band's got the liquor for it, and, dammit, he's a good enough songwriter for the task. His tracks, backed by his motley crew of hippies, one of whom could almost rival Devendra in a beard/hair scraggly contest, brought the crowd to life, giving me a taste of what must have been similar to a smaller, more respectable Woodstock '69. I'm definitely considering checking out more of his music now, considering that I've only heard portions of his earlier albums, and only listened through <i>Cripple Crow</i>, his latest, once.

The coolest part of the set, however, was not one of his songs, but rather the fact that he picked an audience member at random out of a sea of volunteers to come on stage to play a song of his own. I thought it was a joke at first; after all, while he's a total hippie, isn't this a bit TOO much for a festival of this size? Clearly not. In what must have been the single greatest moment of his life, he played a song in front of 20,000 people. And for a dude picked out from the audience at random, he was damn good, too. The fact that he was able to do his song without shitting himself at least three times is commendable, but actually playing a <i>good</i>, not just decent or cute 'aww, thank you for trying', song? Phenomenal. If you're into folk, check out his myspace: <a href=""http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=21850371"">Molotov Pipedream.</a>

Devendra then came back on stage, did a closer, much hand clapping was had, much pot was smoked. The audience gave an outstanding ovation as he left after his finale, presumably to go back stage and drink and smoke.

Ah. What a life.

<b>6. The Futureheads</b>
<img src=""http://www.prefixmag.com/images/interviews/f/futureheads/futureheads_interview.jpg"">

What a charming bunch of gents. The Futureheads play rock music. That's all there is to it. They play fun, catchy rock tunes. What seperates them from every other rock group writing a decent hook or melody, though, is their vocal prowess: Were you to play, say, a Franz Ferdinand track and loop it over with an ocapella group, this would be the result. Their personalities simply radiate energy, and once all of them chime in vocally at once, there's no denying it: This is a killer show.

As mentioned in Danielson, The Futureheads did a great job of getting everyone up and clapping. They also had a neat little segment, which was lovingly referred to as a game, in which the audience sang the vocal harmonies; half of the audience covering one part, the other half covering the second. All in all, though, they seemed to realize a crucial fact that all the best live acts acknowledge: The more interested the audience is, the more energetic the show, and the more enjoyable it is for them to perform.

Needless to say, they were having a blast.

<b>5. Destroyer</b> 
<img src=""http://static.flickr.com/31/94754808_b536868b0f_m.jpg"">

Wait, what? Yes, you're reading correctly. I'm only half way through the list, and Destroyer is already being brought up. This must be a shock coming from a devoted Dan Bejar acolyte such as myself. And this is true; I'm honestly a bit shocked that Destroyer isn't gunning for number one, but as it turns out, Bejar's live act was simply out done by others at the festival. As far as on album goes, Destroyer is still tied with The Mountain Goats in terms of my favorite group at the festival. If you've ever listened to Destroyer, Bejar comes across as somewhat of a lovable madman: Quivering voice accompanied by unconventional pop arrangements and whimsical, verbose lyrics, this man almost seems as if he'd be a total recluse.

And live, well, he kind of is. He let out one line of banter throughout the entire set: ""This song is about... uh..."" That's it. We never really got to find out what the song was about, which would have actually been <i>groundbreaking</i>, as nearly every Destroyer song is a complete enigma surrounded by a labyrinth of self-referential lyrics. Maybe that one line of banter is fitting for Destroyer, a band which offers its fans that line as the only possible answer to being asked the meaning of a song. Maybe that one line of banter is the pinnacle of Destroyer self-referentialism, as he brilliantly summarizes his entire discography in one simple line. That's got to be it. 

His songs were fairly straightforward, with a couple of new parts added here and there, and he certainly did a fine job of performing them. He just didn't bother creating any sort of stage presence at all; but then again, maybe that only enhances the mystery of Destroyer, creating the greatest stage presence of all? I could pontificate on this all day, but the bottomline is, regardless of metaphorical intent, his set just wasn't as exciting as the four I've yet to name. 

That said, I definitely felt super cool and hip knowing a decent amount of lyrics, allowing me to sing along at one of the most lyrically challenging shows on the planet. Knowing even a portion of his lyrics is indeed something in which I pride myself. And, even with Dan's befuddling stage ""presence"", this was the loudest I've ever been able to listen to a Destroyer album, and that alone is enough to skyrocket it to the top half of my list.

<b>4. Man Man</b>
<img src=""http://youaintnopicasso.com/images/mm.jpg"">

YES! That's all I could utter when I saw Honus Honus, frontman of Man Man, enter the stage during set-up dressed in short shorts, a headband, a tight shirt reading ""EAT MORE PAINT"", and aviators; oh, and lest we forget, his moustache. Honus has a moustache that would make even John Stossel quiver in fear; a crop of facial hair so bold that it must require some sort of facial hair brush, not a comb, to get it in order. The rest of the band was, for the most part, equally bearded, though nothing was quite as exceptional as the aforementioned 'stache.

Of course, while their outfits initially excited me and had me prepared for an intense show, little did I expect that they would return from setting up wearing Indian warpaint. This, and this alone, dictated that these men were not here to fuck around: They were here to defend their libidos and testosterone as if war had been declared upon them. Their first song was little more than manly, manly noise: A collage of xylaphone, keyboard, saxaphone, and a drumset that was little more than random shit being hit into other random shit. Then Honus's voice came in, which is the most masculine growl I've ever heard, bar none. Once the two came together in perfect unison, a perfect combination of manly noises and manly vocal, something kicked in - that thing was my ass, and Man Man was doing the kicking. 

Their show only got more incredibly and ridiculous as the set went on, as the band brought feathers to throw into the crowd as they ran about the stage. Oftentimes, there were two or more percussionists, for the necessity that is smashing shit into shit that makes the Man Man sound. As Honus growled over his cacophony, the crowd could only stand back in awe: This really was the finest exhibition of manliness ever seen. 

Man Man's performance can be summarized in one single act: The silverware Honus brought out on stage. It was a bowl, filled with silverware. That was it. He set it on his keyboard bench, took out a piece, and threw it into the other ones in the bowl. The silverware went flying everywhere out of the bowl, not even making a very loud sound. He gathered his forks, knives, and spoons, put them back in the bowl, and did it again. He did this about four or five times. Why? Because he's a man, man.

<b>3. The National</b>
<img src=""http://www.noisepop.com/2006/images/band_pics/the_national.jpg"">

I can't for the life of me figure out why I didn't start listening to these guys earlier. I only just got their 2005 album, <i>Alligator</i>, little over a month ago. I got into some of their back catalogue afterward, but I'm still primarily an <i>Alligator</i> fan - The National are able to pump out powerful rock songs bustling with emotional intensity intertwined between songs that are a bit more subdued but still tremendously addictive. The singer has a crooning baratone which is able to switch over to one of the tactful uses of the rock scream I've ever heard, and the rest of the band is able to play music that is everybit as catchy as it is powerful.

As a general rule of thumb, high-octane on album equals phenomenal live show. As a result, we skipped Jens Lekman (who, in all honestly, looked like a very good act and I regret having to miss him, but it was worth it) to secure a good third-fourth row spot for the set. The wait was more than worthwhile; The National played what could honestly be considered one of the most powerful sets of the afternoon, with the singer looking as if he was having spasms running through his body any time he had to kick into a chorus on the louder tunes. The whole set was remarkable, but the highlights were ""Abel"" and ""Mr. November,"" the latter of which offering the most rousing chorus this side of the Mountain Goats (gee, haven't seen them yet. Wonder where they could be on the list?) ""Mr. November"" was also the primary cause of me losing my voice on Sunday, as screaming ""I'M MR. NOVEMBER, I WON'T FUCK US OVER, I'M MR. NOVEMBER"" at the top of your lungs several times becomes a bit taxing on the vocal chords. The singer deserves some major applause for stamina.

The only real perplexing thing about their set was the fact that they DIDN'T close with ""Mr. November,"" a song that I would literally consider one of the best closers a band could ever write. Rather, they closed with a slower song from one of their earlier albums. Maybe the singer needed a vocal warm-down from all his wailing during ""Mr. November,"" and this was to keep him from losing his voice all together. That's the only real logical explanation I can think of.

<b>2. Spoon</b>
<img src=""http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f182/biansoli2/Spoon-band-06.jpg"">

Ah, Spoon. Inarguably one of the best straight-forward rock groups of our time, they've got it down to a science: Their songs contain a well-oiled rhythm section, some slick guitar playing, and Britt Daniel's grizzled, rockin' vocals. They've also managed to pioneer a sound all their own. A Spoon song is unmistakenably a Spoon song, as a result of a product that is greater than a sum of its parts. Everything just falls together <i>perfectly</i>. Spoon even sampled a new song for the crowd, and it sounded as fresh and catchy as ever, while still maintaining the certain level of familiarity that comes with the Spoon sound. 

So, as no surprise, a band so crisp and pristine in their song-writing and production had a slick, terrific live show. Britt Daniels has obviously got a killer set of pipes on him - the albums make that perfectly clear to the listener. But what becomes more apparent live is the how talented a guitarist Britt Daniels is. I never realized how amazingly well he could, to use guitar cliche terminology (in my defense, I am describing a fairly straight-forward, guitar-based rock group), shred. He's also, as would be assumed for the rocker he is, got the rocker swag down, too. Whereas I'd say Gustav is the ideal long-haired rocker, Britt is the posterboy for the shorthair rockstar; his hair was disheveled to the point of flying straight up over about half of his head by the end of the show, and they only apropos way to describe it would be 'rock and roll.' Him and his band all had terrific stage presence, and it was no challenge to get the audience moving. 

They played their songs. They played them well. They offered a great level of energy. What more could I possibly ask for? Meeting Britt Daniels, you say? Because I did that, too.

After the set, rather than trying to squeeze in for a spot for Os Mutantes (they sounded like they were putting on a fine show, but man, we were fuckin' tired), we decided to take a seat for a while. A few minutes later, we noticed Britt hanging around the front of the stage, signing posters and whatnot. Unfortunately, I didn't get one of the free Spoon posters being distributed at the merch tent - Cory had one and I already had three others to my name - so I had to improvise. I needed to get SOMETHING signed by Britt, no question about that. The only thing I could really think of at the time was one of my gas receipts from the trip, and the more I thought about it the better the idea sounded. I'll eventually have to pay the bill on that thing, and what better way to console myself after spending over three dollars a gallon than to have a reminder right on the receipt of why it was all worth it? So I had Britt Daniels sign my receipt. I didn't hold him up for long - he had other, more deserving fans to attend to - but I told him he played a killer set, shook his hand, and took my receipt, which read, ""Thank Bush, Brett"". 

Cool guy.

<b><h2>1. The Mountain Goats</h2></b>
<img src=""http://www.npr.org/programs/wesat/features/2005/may/mountaingoats/mountaingoats200.jpg"">

It's interesting: For the last four bands, I've had a very hard time placing them in order. Everything between Destroyer and Spoon put on a live show of about equal sublimity, often coming down to the point where it was borderline nitpicking. But picking the number one group of the festival was easy for me. Nothing even came close to touching The Mountain Goats performance; not even Britt Daniel's rocking, Destroyer's indecisiveness, Man Man's manliness. John Darnielle and Peter Hughes trumped all of that in what is, undoubtedly, the single greatest 50 minutes I have ever spent outside. 

The set opened, surprisingly, with ""Jenny"", a track off of the terrific <i>All Hail West Texas</i>. I wasn't totally expecting that - I was expecting him to go with something more recent, as an something off of <i>The Sunset Tree</i> or <i>We Shall All Be Healed</i>. But I can't complain, because ""Jenny"" is one of my favorite Mountain Goats tracks, and it was a great opener - from the first time yelling ""It's the pirate's life for me!"" the entire audience was sold on Darnielle's intricate tales. 

A Mountain Goats show is made infinitely better with knowledge of the lyrics. This is something I was kind of expecting, but not to this extent - I knew my decent knowledge of Mountain Goats lyrics would come in handy, but I didn't know it would enhance the show nearly as much as it did. There's something magical that comes with singing along with John and a crowd full of equally eager, excited Mountain Goats fans. Singing the choruses to nearly half of his songs is some of the best catharic release a show could offer, giving a borderline therapeutic effect. I'm convinced that if somebody sat down the angriest man in the world - the craziest sociopath, the bitterest serial killer - with John Darnielle, a handful of other people, and a lyric sheet, he would feel perfectly fine at the end of it. In fact, he would be one of the happiest, most relieved men on the planet, all through John's poetry in action.

I've long felt that John Darnielle is the single greatest thing to happen to the acoustic guitar, and seeing the Goats live has only proved it. I'd also propose that John Darnelle is one of the greatest things to happen to the pen as well, as his lyrics are some of the best poetry of any genre - music or otherwise - and any era. He has a knack for description, always allowing just the perfect amount, and none of his words seem out of place. Watching John write a song must be like watching a Tetris screen filled evenly with blocks all the way up the screen, sans for the line closest to the left; when John begins to write, it's as if he gets four straight, vertical pieces in a row. And instead of that lame, Russian jig music in the background, it's a perfect combination of acoustic strumming and Peter Hughes on the bass, possibly with a few other instruments and Vanderslice hanging out if we're dealing with one of the newer, cleaner albums. 

""No Children"" alone would have been enough to justify the 70 dollars it took to get to Chicago to see the Pitchfork Music Festival. Never have I felt a song so powerful, so raw, as John's from the point when he began with, ""I hope that our few remaining friends give up on trying to save us"" to, ""I hope we both die."" It's challenging to pick a climax of the song: Would it be ""hand in unlovable hand""? ""I hope the worst isn't over""? ""There is no sight of land""? Fuck it, it's impossible to pinpoint a certain part of the song - the entire thing carried the energy and efficacy of a climax for nearly three minutes. That is the power John Darnielle's pen and guitar, when used in tandem, carries. 

And, to think, I went into the Mountain Goats determined to hear both ""Going to Georgia"" and ""The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton,"" neither of which were played by the Goats. I can't <i>complain</i> about the setlist, per se; he covered the gamut of his career, from new material to a song off his very first 7"", and it's almost a curse when you have as many memorable, fantastic songs as the Goats. I could have listened to them play for hours without showing even the slightest disinterest; unfortunately for me, they're not only human but also on a strict time schedule, so the set had to be cut short without giving me a chance to hear either of those songs. And even missing what I consider two tremendous Mountain Goats staples, I would still consider it by far the best set of the day, and tied with The Arcade Fire and Broken Social Scene for the greatest live show I have ever seen.

It's especially impressive to think that the Goats could be as mindblowing at a festival as either of those bands in a designated venue. The Goats were under strict time restraint, the crowd was bigger, the sun was present; individual festival shows are, typically, on the whole weaker than a small venue show. Yet John Darnielle was able to prove that he has one of the most memorable voices in all of music, and it didn't matter how much time they had, how big the crowd was, or how blistering the sun was. Peter Hughes was able to perfectly compliment his songcraft with his bouncy, infectious bass lines. And that other guy? He could play a mean keyboard. 

I would from this say that, in theory, the Mountain Goats are the single greatest live act performing today, possibly ever. If I am ever able to catch the Mountain Goats at a solo show - like the one they did at Krafbrau that was 21+ last October ($%#$%$#!!!) - when they're given the time to expand, cover more of their music, and have a more intimate setting, it would undoubtedly be breathtaking. And I say that even moreso because it would take a lot of breath to keep singing the entire night.

-----------------------------------------------

And that was Pitchfork, in terms of live shows. Plenty of great stuff, some phenomenal stuff; all in all, a weekend of sunburning and sweating well-spent. There were, regretably, a few acts I would have liked to see that I didn't for the sake of another band of the overwhelming need for food and water. The most notable of those being Art Brut, Jens Lekman, and the Silver Jews. Art Brut had to be missed because it was going on 5:30 and none of us had eaten a single thing, plus we were just at Destroyer for his entire set, making it impossible to get a decent spot for Art Brut, who immediately followed him. Jens had to be missed, as previously stated, for The National. And Silver Jews, while we still couldn't have gotten a very good spot because it was the last act of the day and we had just watched the Futureheads in entirety, had to be missed because all of my friends were whining to leave because they wanted food, drinks, and some of those other petty things necessary for survival. I heard some of Silver Jews from the trainstation a few blocks away, and it, unfortunately, sounded pretty good. It's a shame my friends are a bunch of Silver Anti-Semites.

I also grabbed myself some merchandise, but for my sake since I've been working on this entry for nearly five hours now between writing and getting pictures and mp3's, I'll be brief:
2 T-shirts: One of The National, one of The Wrens (hooray!)
3 albums: Destroyer - Destroyer's Rubies, Okay - High Road, Silver Jews - The Natural Bridge
Free posters: Destroyer, Arcade Fire, Silver Jews

The t-shirts are self-explanatory and awesome.

The CD's have so far all been great purchases. The Silver Jews disc was bought because I had only heard <i>American Water</i> going into the festival, and despite my love for it, I had yet to hear anything else by them; this was instantly remedied with this purchase. The album's a bit more spacious and lethargic than <i>American Water</i>, and I honestly prefer the latter, but it's still a solid album to listen to when I'm feeling at my most listless. And it's also got the single greatest lyric of all-time:

""a robot walks into a bar
orders a drink
lays down a bill
the bartender says, 'hey, we don't serve robots'
and the robot says, 'oh, but someday you will'""

It's also bustling with some other great lines, but I don't want to be here forever quoting Silver Jews. Just know that that's the best of them, and there's no beating that. Period. Sorry, John Darnielle. Love your lyrics, but you just can't top <i>that</i> one.

The Okay album was recommended to me by the dude at the Absolutely Kosher booth, and I'm glad I decided to take the 12 dollar plunge. It's a neat little album, consisting twisted pop arrangements with a tinge of euphoria (a tinge? euphoria? how does that work? I don't totally know), but I can definitely see why he recommended it to me based off of Sunset Rubdown and Frog Eyes. The dude's voice also sounds like somewhat of a mix between Baxter (the fly bad guy) from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dan Bejar. It's an interesting blend.

And <i>Destroyer's Rubies</i> is my favorite album of 2006 so far. I've had it for months. It was very good then, and it is still very good now. And now I've got a shiny booklet with it.

Last but not least, I really do feel some kind of obligation to pay tribute to the crowd at Pitchfork. The announcer, while frequently mocked for making the festival up to be something greater than it really is (though in smaller doses than last year), is partially right: The community at Pitchfork is really unlike any other. Everybody is nice, courteous, and a general blast to be around. It's also nice to have a greater knowledge of music this year than I did last. While I still don't consider myself an expert by any regard, I now feel that I'm able to carry a musical conversation without feeling like I'm dulling the recipient. I had a good chat with the guy at the Absolutely Kosher booth, where he got me more excited than ever for the Swan Lake album (Dan Bejar, Spencer Krug (wolf parade), Carey Mercer (frog eyes)) by saying that he's heard it and it's phenomenal. And I also met the guy who cofounded the Destroyer Wiki or something along those lines while getting my legit copy of Rubies; and the Destroyer Wiki is the most awesome Destroyer website of all time, since it annotates his lyrics with all possible references, so I gotta say, I admire the man. 

So that's that. Until next year.

That took around five hours. I'm done. Nothing else has happened in my life. Period."

"event","I remember there was a time when I considered it taboo to go a week without writing in my livejournal; now I'm going a month and a half without even batting an eyelash. Maybe it's because my life has slowed to a crawl, maybe it's because it's summer and my life is a constant hustle and bustle (ha), or maybe it's because I'm not nearly as prolific a livejournalist as I once was. Or maybe, despite the first two possibilities being ostensibly contradictory, it's a combination of all three. 

I wouldn't consider my life as of late exciting. But I do have a job, which is relatively limiting. Time I <i>would</i> spend writing about the insignificant and trivial events of my life is now spent delivering food to hungry guests at Red Lobster. I suppose it's a mildly noble endeavor - and by ""noble"", I mean it makes me money, which is, so I've been told, the most noble and selfless of causes. 

I'm finally a waiter. I didn't update during my training period, and I don't intend to elaborate on it now, weeks after the fact; but know this: I didn't get fired. I managed to make it through training at Red Lobster, which I've been told by numerous employees who have worked numerous server jobs, is a rough and hectic position, especially for somebody who's never worked a server job before. Let alone any job. So, despite a couple of rough patches during training and being hired nearly on charisma alone, I made it through with relatively few scrapes and bruises - on both me <b>and</b> my guests. 

The cash flow seems to be pretty decent. Yeah, $2.65 an hour - that's a bit of a downer. But the tips are, in fact, quite good. I'm still working a two table section, which can occasionally slow to a crawl - the upside being, of course, that it can only speed up to a comfortable power walk, which is good for a newbie waiter like myself - but it's fairly bad on tips. That said, I've walked out of the restaurant with a decent chunk of change in my pocket after a couple of shifts. And I can only expect it to improve from there, as they, I hope, deem myself suited for a full-fledged three-table section, complete with stuff to do at all points of my shift instead of at sporadic intervals. 

Anyway, that's about all there is to say about my job. It's not bad work - it's still work, which I'm against by principle, but I can't complain. It's money, and I can definitely take another month of it before heading back to school. And it does give me the occasional interesting story to tell - something I've been lacking since school has ended. I've got a handful of them, and odds are, given my primarily local readerbase, I've already told you most of them, but I'll divulge the best of them here: The homeless guy.
<lj-cut text=""Don't Click if You've Heard This One Before"">
It was 7:00 at night, nearly an hour after I started my shift as a food walker as part of my training. It was a slow night - the restaurant was relatively empty for a Saturday evening, and I, as a food walker, had next to absolutely nothing to do. My heart began to yearn for excitement, and, fortunately, God heard my yawns.

Shortly after I acknowledged the night as boring as fuck, one of the waitresses burst into the alley complaining that she was just sat some crazy homeless son of a bitch, he was trying to tell her about every single injury he has ever received (she wanted to augment his stories with a couple of her own), and he looked like he was going to take up one of her tables for the rest of the night. Most of the alley simply sympathized with her complaints; everybody except for one other waitress, who took her pathos much deeper than the rest of us, recalling a similar occurrence happening to her nearly three years ago. The second waitress recalled this crazy homeless motherfucker, fitting the same scraggly disposition described of this crazy homeless son of a bitch, occupying one of her tables for nearly <i>five hours</i> and then attempting a walk-out. He was caught, of course, which would lead one to believe that he wouldn't have the gall to step back in the restaurant after being blacklisted as a walk-out.

But she was curious. So she walked out, glanced at his table, and came running back into the alley, screaming, ""I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, IT'S HIM!"" After the five minutes it took for everybody to wrap their minds around this overwhelming coincidence, the first waitress decided to get one of the managers to watch after him. At this point, the manager approached the man, told him that he would after to see some cash before he ordered another bottle of wine and a lobster or two, and immediately took patrol of the entrance. The homeless guy started sweating bullets, as he realized that he had been pegged. But he wasn't going to give up quite yet - he kept his eye on the door, waiting for the manager to take a single second away from it.

Well, the manager walked around the door for a good five-ten minutes before realizing that, you know, <i>something</i> has gotta been done. So he decided to give the guy a chance to make a break for it. The manager feigned a quick step outside, and the man without hesitation made a scramble to the front door; he was immediately stopped by a wily manager, who told the man that he'd need to show some cash before leaving.  

This is where things got interesting. 

The man obviously didn't have any money; and, sure, he considered the possibility of getting busted again, but he at least wanted one hell of a meal out of it. And now he wasn't getting his hell of a meal, nor a meal of any level of damnation. So he feeling a bit lousy about the whole situation. And what did he do? He decided that, rather than go down gracefully, he was going to go down literally: He got on the floor and started to fake having a seizure right in the middle of the lobby. The best part about the entire scenario was how blatantly phony it was. About halfway through his erratic spasms, another manager decided to give him a soft kick, to which the man replied, ending his seizures all together and taking an authoritative tone, ""DON'T YOU KICK ME!"" He immediately proceeded to return to his ""seizures."" 

One of the managers made a quick sprint for the phone and called the cops, while the other manager tried to persuade the guests to take a seat in the bar to get away from this nutjob. His efforts were in vain, as, and this is one of my favorite parts of this entire story, the guests thought it was hilarious to watch this grown man squirm and cry like a baby. The manager really couldn't argue, as he himself was holding back laughter. Eventually, though, the cops did arrive. Upon seeing the man on the floor, they said, and I quote:

""Oh, Paul, get up.""

The homeless man stood up, went with the police officers, and the managers both burst out into uncontrollable laughter.</lj-cut>

So that's my most exciting work story to date, and it'll be a tough act to follow. Odds are I'll go for the rest of the summer without getting anything nearly as great as that. As far as Brian-centric stories go, you've now heard the pick of the litter - don't expect anything that entertaining to come out of me until I at least get back to school. 

Also, and this is my last job related paragraph, my job gives me the single greatest perk of all time: Free Red Lobster cheese bread at all times. I can eat it on the spot, I can grab some in a bag and take it home with me, I can give it to ducks to give them a taste of luxury and a break from that dull normal bread they get all the time; anything you can think of involving Red Lobster cheese bread, I can do. I've actually got about 18 pieces of it sitting on my counter from my shift on Thursday, and it's definitely not getting any more fresh as the days pass. So, you know, if you want bread, just swing by my house. I'm serious here: I have too much bread. If you want some, just ring my doorbell. I'll give you some. It might be kind of stale, but it's really gotta go. It's getting very old. And if you live far away from me, post your mailing address and I will send you some. At this point, I doubt it a few days of shipping will have a huge effect on how stale it most likely is.

Next obligatory thing on which I should probably comment: Gee, summer is already more than half-over. Oh dear. I can't say I'm particularly upset or shocked - I don't know how shock could play into this, as I've counted the days of my summer crawl by one by one and the current tally seems about right. More than anything, I'm nearly relieved. Summer's become almost somewhat of a nuisance. Sure, yeah, it's great to be home, see people I haven't seen in a while, and hang out with the old high school crew; but it's also not. Don't get me wrong, I love doing nothing. And I love doing nothing with all of you guys. But, relatively speaking, I've fallen into the belief that I never thought I would: College, even when it's in boring-ass Mt. Pleasant, is more interesting than home life. There are more people, more things to do (and I plan to take more advantage of this next year than the last, as I actually get around to applying to the paper as a reporter. I also might look into the radio station, but we'll see if I have the ambition to take part in more than one activity), and, from a work angle, the classes are slightly more satisfying than working a part-time job that, although I don't entirely loathe, isn't particularly satisfying in any regard. Receiving a generous tip doesn't feel nearly as fulfilling as getting an A and a slew of positive comments on an essay that was pulled together last minute. 

But that's not to say that summer doesn't have a few more tricks up its sleeve. Free laundry aside, the best summer has to offer is undoubtedly the greatly-anticipated-since-March-when-it-was-announced-God-I've-had-the-tickets-in-my-sock-drawer-for-months Pitchfork music festival. It's going to be absolutely fantastic. Great bands, larger group than the Nate-Brian duo, great city; hell, we don't even have to pay for hotel fees this time, as Nate's old roommate conveniently lives in Chicago and is letting all of us crash at his place. The only real downside I can think of, and this hurts me ever so, is that the Mountain Goats and Destroyer are playing back-to-back sets. Since they're inarguably my two most anticipated acts at the festival, I'm kind of bummed that I'll get a great spot for the Mountain Goats but be forced to settle for a mediocre spot at Destroyer. The dilemma may be enough rip my heart in two - from there, half of my heart would get a good spot at the Mountain Goats and the other half would get in one of the front rows for Destroyer. 

Well, at least I'll be nice and up close for good ol' John Darnielle, and I think <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH6_h0pbEY8"">this video</a> adequately sums up why the Mountain Goats will be a must-see. If he starts playing ""The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton,"" absolutely nothing, not even the sight of a two-inch Dan Bejar, could dampen my spirits. 

More on Pitchfork in a couple weeks, when I'm in the state of bittersweet relaxation from having my face thoroughly rocked off for two days straight. 

To close, I figure I should write on a couple of things I'm sure everybody cares about. I got another haircut recently - partially for work, partially because my hair was at a frustrating stage of middle-length. It's shorter than ever before this time. If you thought the <i>last</i> cut shocked and awed, you aren't even ready for this one. I definitely don't think it looks bad, but I'm not completely satisfied with it. I like a little more length on top - enough to, at the very least, appear the part of disheveled and eccentric, something of which I'm not currently capable. But I suppose it's growing on me: a millimeter or so a day, I imagine. In a couple weeks, I should be moderately pleased, and by school, it will be what I would consider adequate. 

On the plus side, I get to do something I haven't truly been able to do since junior year of high school: Go through all the exciting stages of hair growth. My hair currently feels like a fuzzy embryo, waiting to fully mature and be raised into a successful mane. It'll give me a good sense of variety throughout the school year, at the very least.

Also, I got another pair of sunglasses, finally. My old dollar-store circular rose tinted pair were no longer up to par. They were tainted by scratches, blemishes, and the inherent flaw of blocking very little sunlight, rendering them fairly useless. Now I've got a slightly darker, slightly ritzier (JC Penney quality, everybody!) pair. I'm told I now look like a total beatnick with them on, which is, I suppose, a step up from the smelly hippie status I had with my old pair. 

Well, that's it. I'm done with this thing for now. I'm going to consider the unruly length of this entry warm-up for what will inevitably be a nearly interminable entry on the Pitchfork festival in a couple of weeks. If you don't believe me, just read my entry from last year; that thing was <i>long</i>, and I'm even more verbose now than I was back then. Is there a character limit on livejournal entries? We'll find out."

"event","I'll admit. Over the past couple of weeks, I started to lose some enthusiasm about summer. The job hunt was going miserably, the weather was either too hot or too rainy, and it didn't seem like I could catch a break anywhere. 

Well, the largest of my problems - the job - seems to have cleared up a bit. I had an interview with the Madison Heights Red Lobster yesterday to become a server, and I feel it went quite well. I met with the guy who would be my direct manager, and I think he at least kind of liked me. The interview was standard-fare: A few questions about customer service, myself, etc etc. There's apparently some numeric grading system that accompanies the interview, and I have no idea how it could work on something that's entirely short answer, but it doesn't really matter. I was, evidently, a solid enough interviewee to make the manager give me a vote of confidence; he skipped the entire grading system, saying that I did a, and I quote, ""very good job and [he] couldn't imagine how I could have failed."" 

So that's a very positive thing. I have one more interview on Monday with the general manager - the head honcho of the Red Lobster, the guy with his name adorned on some fancy fish sign in the front of the restaurant - to, I assume, seal the deal, as long as I don't totally blow it. From there, they should start training me the following week; the previous Thursday being a day to iron out all the paperwork. If I land this job, and I hope I do, I feel it necessary to point out the amount of Benjamins in which I will be rolling: Quite a few. Waiting would be a significantly better job than the shitty minimum wage work I was expecting, and while it's probably going to be a bit more work than, say, some video store job, every day I will have tips as a form of solace. Not to mention that, honestly, I think I would enjoy waiting more than a lot of easier, menial work. All of my charm and charisma, which currently goes toward doing jack shit, will go toward selling delicious dishes of seafood. 

I also received another response. In a move that could be deemed entirely unnecessary, Jazzy Java, a local coffee shop that just opened on 18 and Rochester, gave me a phone call this morning specifically to tell me that they were <b>not</b> going to hire me. This is also the place that, if I haven't talked to you at all over the past week, had an application that was no more than some one-page personal, informal letter about why I'd like to work at the shop. Anyway, during the phone call, the manager told me that, while I was apparently a promising applicant (I pride myself in my one-page personal, informal letters!), they weren't interested in hiring me because I'd be leaving in the fall. They said it'd take roughly two months to train me in all the intricacies of their coffee shop works, and by the time I'd be fully self-sufficient, it'd be August and I'd be leaving. I guess that's understandable, even though I doubt it'd take two full months to figure out coffee, tea, and gelato, but hey, I still really appreciate the fact that they actually gave me a response, even if they weren't interested in hiring me. It's entirely a psychological thing; whereas every other time I was rejected for a job (and boy, were there a lot of those) seemed like a kick in the crotch while I wasn't looking, this was like a friendly pat on the back with an encouraging, ""try again sometime, man!"" In fact, they even told me to try again sometime I'd be in town for longer. Not that I can think of a single time I'd be in time for any longer than summer vacation, but hey, they're trying to be supportive. They're at least making a concerted effort to make me feel as if I haven't been kicked in the crotch.

There was a Walkmen show last night, which I decided to attend on a whim. I wasn't entirely sure about going to the show - between that, Dungen, and Pitchfork, it would almost seem as if I was spending <i>too</i> much money on concerts. Money that, and this is assuming my current unemployed status, I don't have. But hey, I had just made fifty bucks helping Mrs. Racklyeft move stuff and tear out carpet, and it's not like I spend money on much else these days. Sure, I should be spending my money on better, more responsible things; but being the irresponsible, carefree teenager I am, ""should"" has no place in my vocabulary. I saw The Walkmen last night, and it was awesome. More within:

Let me start by saying that I'm very, very lucky that I'm alive right now. And no, this isn't some lame, cheap shot at Detroit being a total hellhole; this is an entirely reasonable remark about the state of the weather during our drive to the show. Before we entered the storm, I made the remark to Cory that it looked like the clouds surrounding Hyrule Castle after Ganon took over in Ocarina of Time. And they were, indeed, very intimidating and scary-looking; not that we could see them for long, of course. The second we entered the storm, the windshield suddenly became overtaken by the water of something in between a monsoon and a Biblical flood. We couldn't drive more than a couple minutes before giving up, pulling over under some tunnel, and being amazed that the rain was actually blowing in the tunnel in amounts that were still <i>slightly</i> blinding. Between that, the crash of thunder, and the flash of lightning, I definitely considered the possibility of dying; or, at the very least, being cripplingly wounded. 

But eventually the rain did let up, and our bodies were completely in tact. After a bit of additional stumbling thanks to a shoddy map from the ticketmaster website, (I suppose it's fair - we bought tickets at the door instead of online, so ticketmaster didn't get to fuck us over in service fees. Getting us lost for a half an hour was the least they could do.) we arrived at St. Andrews' Hall.

""Who knows what that beat is?"" This was the first thing I heard when I walked into the place. Upon further investigation, the beat was a slowed down version of that from ""Funkytown"", and there was some crazy-looking fat guy with a moustache on the stage. 

This man will be referred to, from this point on, as Crazy Fucker. This is the most fitting label I can imagine for this man - not just because he was maniacal (which he was), and not just because I don't actually know his name, but because he wanted to fuck everything. Not in the sexual sense, of course; but he told people who like to roller blade to fuck off, he told polar bears to fuck off, and I'm struggling to think of something he didn't, at some point, tell to fuck off. His lyrics were literally his monologue put to chords, with lines such as ""The weather's real nice / too bad we're all going to die soon."" And then there was that whole thing about baby seals being happy about global warming, because it would kill polar bears, the natual hunter of baby seals. I suppose that's a good way to look at it, but, as he was quick to remind us, too bad we're all going to die soon. 

The second opener was much closer to what I expected out of an opener for the Walkmen. They were fairly good, straightforward indie rock, almost like some kind of Walkmen-lite. It was a fitting warm-up for the Walkmen. After the jarring, yet entertaining, experience of Crazy Fucker, I needed something to get me back into the groove of toe-tapping and head-nodding, which these guys did quite well. They met my criteria for a good opener: An enjoyable way to pass the time. And they did get me in the mood for The Walkmen.

The Walkmen themselves were absolutely fantastic. It never struck me just how much the singer fuckin' wails during his songs. It was somewhere along the third time I saw the veins popping in his neck during ""The Rat"" that I realized I was in for a spectacular show. It wasn't just some lame, scream-o scream either; this man possessed the sheer vocal power to turn that scream into actual pitches, while still maintaining all of the energy that comes with a killer scream. He also had the rock and roll microphone stagger down to a science; he knew just how far he could tip that microphone stand without having it fall into the audience. It's commendable that he was able to keep this level of energy throughout the entire show. I remember, slightly before the show, the set-up crew brought out a fan and tilted it toward the audience, then tilted it toward only the band. I was kind of bummed about that, but after seeing just how much vocal strain the singer puts himself through, I'm completely understanding. 

I'm not overly familiar with many specific Walkmen songs - most of the times I listen to them I just let one of their album play through and call it that, never really noting many song names - but one track off the new album, ""Louisiana,"" I was slightly worried about. See, ""Louisiana,"" is a great song, but there is one thing that seperates it from the rest of the Walkmen's catalog: It has a horn line. And the horn line, really, is an integral part of the song. When they began strumming the opening chords, I was a little worried - I didn't see a single trumpet in sight. And this anxiety lasted for a good minute of the song, until I saw the guitarist step aside, revealing a trumpet resting on one of the amps. I immediately felt a feeling of catharsis, as the guitarist played the horn line that I love oh so much.

We also got to meet the group after the show for a bit. As it turns out, the singer is Cory's ex-drumline-member's cousin, so we had the connections. We didn't really talk for long, though. While he didn't sound tired throughout any of the songs, the singer was totally hoarse after the show. I guess it's fair - he is human, afterall. And no human could look like his neck is about to explode for nearly an hour without some sort of exhaustion. 

Great show, and the singer seemed like a cool enough dude. This isn't the end of my concert-going, though. Next Monday I'm seeing Swedish rockers and prettiest band on the planet, Dungen. This is the third time I've seen them live, and I have no reason to believe it will be anything but the most awesome time yet. I'm expecting some new material, since Gustav has stated that he plans to have a new album out by the fall. And I'll be able to buy that t-shirt that I've been wanting since the time I saw them in October, when they were all sold out. I'm really looking forward to this.
</lj-cut>

Well, that covers the two significant developments in my life right now: Possibly having a job lined up and seeing The Walkmen. So I guess that's all I'm going to type for noWAIT A SECOND, how could I forget to tell you guys?! I beat Paper Mario 2, and it was one of the best ways to kill 30 hours I've ever seen. Aside from reading this post in its entirety, that is."

"event","Well, I'm done with school now. I've been done with school for nearly two weeks now. Finals came and went - and they came and went pretty well, too. I'm satisfied with my grades this semester; despite a lackluster B- in sign language, a grade so embarrassingly low that it may have you rethinking the legitimacy of my rocket ship sign, and an A- in astronomy lab, caused entirely by an incomplete study guide (though I don't blame the TA for, you know, cutting out half the material - you see, he and I both are very lazy men. I sympathize with him, and I like to view the little hyphen in my grade as a sign of our bond; a small horizontal line connecting us for eternity in our dislike for all things productive), I managed to pull A's across the board. And it actually managed to raise my GPA up from a shameful 3.67 to a prestigious 3.71 - that's <b>.04</b> of hard work done in the past few months, guys.

So what have I been up to with my first few weeks of summer? Well, let me give you a run-down of my last couple of days, which I feel are indicative of my entire summer to date:
- Today, I got out of my bathrobe at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
- Yesterday, I got out of my bathrobe at 5:15 in the afternoon.
- Sunday, I got out of my bathrobe at 7 at night.

For the sake of contrast, I haven't even touched my bathrobe in well over a year. But a combination of shit weather, shit job hunting, and shit nearly everything else has led me to revive the proud tradition of lounging around in a bathrobe - it's a comfortable middle-ground between being nearly naked in no more than boxers and a t-shirt, and the professionalism of jeans, a t-shirt, and a shower. The bathrobe at any time after noon is almost a symbol of depressing stagnancy; indeed, a true sign of how uneventful my life has become. 

Speaking of the job hunt, this absolutely has to be one of the most disheartening experiences on which I've ever embarked. Potbelly was a total job-tease. They led me on for two full interviews and told me they'd call me after coming to a conclusion with the entire management staff - well, I had my second interview on Saturday. Now it's Wednesday, and I still haven't gotten a call. So I'm just assuming they're not planning on hiring me and don't have the heart to call me up and crush my dreams of becoming the greatest sculptor of sandwiches the world has ever seen. And that's fine. But know this, people: Next time you go to Potbelly and your sandwich is slightly over-toasted, your condiments slightly sloppy - you can thank Potbelly for not hiring me.

My other hopeful prospects for jobs have also fallen through. I called up the two Paneras I've applied at, and both turned me down. One was fully staffed, and one pulled some total bullshit on me. Word of advice: When filling out a job application, and there's both a section for when you're available to work and when you'd like to work, don't fill out the ""when you'd like to work"" section with anything that you'd consider an ideal schedule. They turned me down on the basis of availability based solely on that section, despite my <i>actual</i> schedule being entirely open. That application was deceptive as hell, and, Panera, I don't approve of your dirty hiring tricks. 

So, now, where's this leave me? I'm not entirely sure. I'm now attempting to follow up on the Einstein Bros. application I dropped off over spring break, which will hopefully turn up an actual result. I called them up earlier today, and they said that they were working on sifting through the applications, and that they were waiting for some of their people to leave for the summer before hiring a new staff. So I've still got a shot there. A shot that will, ideally, be more accurate than any of my other shots to date, which have all figuratively gone astray and hit innocent old people and babies. 

That said, I'm not humoring myself with the illusion that I'm above fast food. And I will cave into a Burger King job or something along those lines if I must. But I'd prefer not to, because when it comes to shitty part-time jobs, I'd rather be on the less-shitty end of the spectrum - a job that will, if one were to continue this fecal analogy for much longer than would be considered reasonable, be more of a clean, solid stool than horrific, bloody diarrhea. 

But that's not to say my summer hasn't had some interesting elements.

I've finally been catching up on the huge backlog of games I've been meaning to play. The first on my list, and probably the biggest as it's been on this backlog for over five years, was Ocarina of Time. Yes, the Zelda game. Yes, the game that's widely considered to be one of the finest pieces of digital software ever made. And yes, the game that I'd never completed. But now the overwhelming burden of shame that comes with never having completed Ocarina of Time is lifted. Now, if I'm ever around anybody that brings up the topic of this game and how great it is, I no longer have to sheepishly mumble, ""I never finished it"" - I can now say, with complete confidence, ""yeah, I agree.""

The next game on my list: Paper Mario 2. It's lots of fun so far, and it's got pretty much all of the charm and originality I remember from the original. So that's something to do to kill the time - something to do while lounging in my bathrobe.

But, by far, the boldest and most adventurous aspect of my summer has to be my newfound cereal lifestyle. I'll admit, Central had me spoiled when it comes to cereal. After experiencing the sheer ecstasy of a cereal bar - the terrific joy of no less than 16 selections, spanning from Kellog to General Mills, at any given time of the day - it was hard to go back to my regular diet of either nothing or Pop-Tarts. So I've been keeping the cupboard well-stocked, and not only that, but I've found that the aisles of Kroger have an even more fantastic selection than CMU. I've had some legitimately exotic breakfasts thanks to my trips to Kroger, and I'd like to share some of the best with you:

<b>Peanut Butter Toast Crunch:</b> Let me get this out of the way first: I've been interested in this cereal for nearly six months now, ever since I saw it in the aisles of Meijer with (I believe) Cory and Alesa. It does seem like a match made in heaven - the sweet goodness of Cinnamon Toast Crunch combined with the creamy deliciousness of, well, anything with peanut butter in it. After months of anticipation, did the cereal live up to the hype? I regret to say it did not. That's not to say it's <i>bad</i>, persay, but not quite a match made in heaven. It's more of a match made outside of the pearly gates that wasn't quite up to St. Peter's snuff - turned down and forced to exist in cereal limbo with other unsuccessful but bold journeys into cereal combinations. Still, though, I'd say it's worth a shot, but it doesn't dethrone Peanut Butter Captain Crunch as the current leader in peanut butter cereal.

<b>Berry Lucky Charms:</b> Totally Boo Berry, right?! Well, assuming you know what Boo Berry is - Boo Berry is a delicious cereal that exists only in the rarest of locations. It combines the sweet berry goodness of a fruity cereal and enhances it with tasty marshmallows. I've had Boo Berry on a couple of previous occasions, and I definitely enjoyed it. But my inexperience with my cereal didn't allow me to fully see its weakness, which became very apparant after my second day of eating it for breakfast - it's just not very filling. It's tasty, it's sweet, but it just can't fill me up as well as, say, Frosted Mini-Wheats. A tasty mid-day treat, yes, but a breakfast? Hardly. And not only that, but I think General Mills downed the marshmallow:cereal-piece ratio, and that's just not cool.

Other than that, I've pretty much just stuck to the norms: Frosted Mini-Wheats, Honey Nut Cheerios, etc. But even the dullest cereal can be made exciting when going through my standard cereal restocking process. I'm quite the happening sight at Kroger, falling into probably at least a dozen college slacker stereotypes. I typically purchase three fresh boxes along with a new gallon of milk (assuming my dad hasn't restocked that recently), and carts are for suckers, so I just try to carry everything in my hands. So there I am, shaggy hair, slightly wrinkled button-down shirt, jeans, carrying three boxes of cereal underneath one arm and a gallon of milk in the other hand. An impeccable image of college slackerdom roaming the aisles of Kroger - I highly encourage all of you to be on the lookout for me next time you're in the area. You may just get to experience one of the greatest sights of your life.

All I ask of you, when you set eyes upon my unkempt self, is to realize just how much effort was required for me to get out of my bathrobe."

"event","As of today, I've managed to read six of the required chapters for my history exam this Thursday. Now, admittedly, these six chapters are coming from a deficit of something like twelve chapters, but I'm going to adopt the same philosophy as I had for the mid-term: If I have read <em>just</em> enough of the chapters, I can BS the rest. It's a delicate balance, but it's one I know well; and, hey, I nailed it last time. As much as I hate to brag more than once about my accomplishments, let's not forget that I managed to pull the lowest score on the mid-term needed for an A.<br /><br />I think I'll finish all the chapters on Rome, but I don't really feel like going back and catching up on Alexander's conquests in Greece and Persia and wherever the fuck else he went; rather, like any good college student, I will just wikipedia his name. <br /><br />So, I'm feeling accomplished. Should I feel accomplished? No, not really. But a false sense of accomplishment is the best kind of accomplishment - it's all the perks without any of the work.<br /><br />Anyway, I got tagged and I feel like doing something mindless after a full day of scholarly reading, so here's this quiz thing:<br /><br />So, the rules are, once you've been tagged you have to write a blog<br />with 6 weird things/habits about yourself. In the end, you need to list<br />6 other people to tag and list their names...<br /><br />6 weird things about me...<br /><br />1. I decided to read a little <a href=""http://saidthegramophone.com/"">Said the Gramophone</a> today after a couple months of pretty much ignoring it, and of all the beautifully written song descriptions, these words caught my eye the most: ""Norwegian military waltz."" Needless to say, I immediately downloaded this <a href=""http://216.120.231.113/~saidthe/home/Mister_Kaiser.mp3"">waltz</a>, and it's, as expected, one of the coolest things I've heard in a while.<br /><br />2. Despite the tremendous amount of effort required to get me to do so, I actually kind of enjoy reading fancy, scholarly history. I divulged this guilty pleasure a couple of updates ago, so I won't bore you with repetition; but I feel it to be necessary to point out, in this survey specifically, how super lame I am.<br /><br />3. If the weather's nice, I enjoy taking walks to nowhere in the company of my iPod.<br /><br />4. I don't wish to live much past 50. Getting old, in my life-view, would be a miserable experience; I don't plan on having kids, nor do I see myself getting married, so my best days will be long gone. So, rather than undergoing the process that would undoubtedly turn me into an bitter, lonely, senile old man, I see no shame in calling it quits around 50. Plus, if I hit 45 and am still in good health, I can look into a plethora of terrific, harmful drugs in a desperate attempt to shorten my lifespan.<br /><br />5. I firmly believe Teddy Grahams are the most underrated snack food on the market, and I try to encourage people to eat them every chance I get.<br /><br />6. I've toasted my Pop-Tarts before and, honestly, I kinda prefer 'em cold. It's not just a convenience thing.<br /><br />6 people to tag (notice: I don't remember if some of you have been tagged by other people, but let's face it, my tags are the only ones that count): Nick, Nate, Loren, Molly, Leah, Jaime."

"event","For the past week or so, I've had one pack of fruit Gushers left in my room. I've been saving it for a special occasion - I can't count the number of times I almost went into the box to get the final pouch, only to say, ""no... later."" I knew that someday I'd need that pack of fruit Gushers more than anything in the world.

Tonight, I had a mediocre plate of spaghetti with a couple of bland breadsticks. And that was the best the cafeteria had to offer. There was only one way to salvage this meal, and I knew it from the second I sat down at my table with nothing more than pasta and breadsticks: Tonight, I would have those Gushers. 

The moment I got back to my room I made a straight shot toward my box of Gushers, but somehow... it was empty. I checked the floor. I checked the old box. I even stuck my hand into the box, in case my allergy ridden eyes were deceiving me; but alas, there were no Gushers to be found. 

I don't know where they went. Maybe I ate them and forgot about it, maybe one of my roommates stole a package - there's no way to know. All I know is that the one thing that I've been looking forward to for over a week, my saving grace during the hectic time of finals, didn't even exist. And that's kind of a drag. 

But on the plus side, all I need to do is one more essay, read up on something like 1,000 years of man, and iron out a sign language dialogue until I'm done with school! I'm definitely looking forward to school being over. During the last month and a half, I've wanted to be in Mt. Pleasant less and less by the day, and as little as I want to get home and work some inevitably shitty summer job for the next four months, it still, for the time being, sounds more appealing than being stuck here.

This Thursday, people!

Oh, and one last thing. As of last night, I've had my last major milestone of my first year of college: I did my last load of college laundry. It will now be nearly five months until I have to plop another $1.75 in quarters into a machine."

"event","Today's been fantastic. Despite having three classes, I've managed to not go to any of them, and I don't need to feel any sort of guilt for skipping. I feel it was justified, anyway. The elusive Chris Witt, man of many plans every weekend I am in town, was at Central for the morning, and what kind of person would I be if I selfishly chose to learn about ancient history and sign language instead of visiting him the one chance I had? I made the right decision. Admittedly, it wasn't easy to turn my back on three hours of learning, but what can I say? I'm just a great friend.

And not only that, but my journalism class, my third class on Tuesday, was canceled due to an out of class assignment that is, upon reading the requirements, very, very easy. I have to observe people's habits with mass media, and write, in a one-page credit/no-credit paper, their uses and gratifications with the piece of media. It's also not due until Thursday, so not only is it an easy assignment, but I get the opportunity to procrastinate as well.

However, today, even in its terrific abandon of all classes, can't hold a candle to the wild and crazy weekend that was Easter weekend.

First, and the topic that I feel most obligated to write on, was that I did officially go through with the hair cut. In a move that certainly sacrificed a bit of my manliness, I opted to go with a fancy salon, via Cory's recommendation (yes, that does make this even more effeminate). But I feel the end result was worth it - the general consensus, from what I can tell, is that the hair cut was a very, very good decision. And it's most certainly easier to maintain -  gone are the days of conditioning for a good five minutes! Now, my hair only requires a couple of minutes to look its best! And I've also got this ritzy finishing cream, which helps keep it from getting massively frizzy and poofy. It's all very professional, let me say.

The weekend did, however, take a turn for the worst on the trip to Kalamazoo to see Vanderslice on Easter. We encountered some really, really rough traffic - I believe we may have gone four or five miles in one hour. What really got me, though, wasn't  the simple fact that there was bad traffic, but rather the cause; as it turns out, the traffic back-up was completely unnecessary.

It was caused, primarily, by the right lane ending.

Now, I'm sure most of you are aware on my stance toward those who ride the lane to its very end, those who choose to ignore the multiple signs indicating the lane's imminent end. I'm not a big fan of them - their selfish douchebaggery is the cause of the very traffic they are trying to avoid. It's all very circular, actually. If we didn't have people driving the lane to its end, there would be no traffic; but if we didn't have any traffic, there wouldn't be any people driving the lane to its end.

So, obviously, somebody needed to let these people know the error of their ways - to let them know that, if we all work together, we can stop this vicious cycle!

The only true solution in this case would have been the Douche, but it was too dark and the odds of the drivers looking at the window, squinting, and possibly making out the letters ""D-O-U-C-H-E"" in those final hours of twilight were slim. So I had to be a bit more resourceful. I noticed that many of them were cruising with their windows down. A fact that, if combined with open windows on my car, could allow me to convey a simple message to them.

I've been told that I'm loud, I've been told that I can have a very powerful, resonating voice - I didn't understand why I have this voice until  that fateful evening. It was this instance that I feel God, who gave me such a powerful, loud voice, intended me to work to change the world for the better and stop this heinous douchebaggery. I really, truly feel that I was put on this Earth to stop people driving down a closing lane to the very end, that it is my one true purpose in life; and I feel that night may have been my test.

At every car that drove by, I yelled a message, although ridden with profanity, that offered a better world for everybody; a world where traffic could, at times, break twenty miles an hour. Combined with the Douche sign, courteously held up by one of the other members of my car (who were also committed to creating a utopian driving society), I feel I may have changed lives for the better. One lady, who noticed me in between puffs of her cigeratte, did take my offering - she changed lanes and entered the very comfortable gap I created in between me and the nearest car. And even if I've only affected that one person, at least I've done something. Maybe she will spread the glorious message. Who knows? Someday, we may never have to deal with douchebags in traffic zones.

But the payoff for the traffic - the John Vanderslice show - was more than well-worth waiting over an hour in traffic.

<lj-cut text=""Vanderslice!"">I was a bit worried that we were going to get there late, especially considering that we were pushing a good half an hour after the doors opened when we picked up Peter from his dorm, but it all worked out okay. The show was incredibly small, moreso than any other small venue show I've attended - there were maybe about fifty or so members in the entire audience. So, my main concern, which was being stuck in a crappy spot in the back of the bar, wasn't even an issue. The back of the crowd didn't extend very far past the stage, and we actually managed to land really great spots, because we managed to show up before the opener ended. Once people got out of the crowd after the opener to grab another beer or use the bathroom, we were able to be in the second and third row without a problem.

Vanderslice's performance was everything I expected it to be. He's a very talented man, gifted with one of my favorite voices in all of music. He managed to cover most of the songs I wanted to see live, and, despite a couple of issues with the Moog (ultra 80's keyboard, for those not in the know), he performed them very, very well. He had a nice balance between his more powerful, active songs, which filled the room with energy (although not quite as much as, say, an Of Montreal show. Except for that guy next to me who was really getting into it - he definitely was filled to the brim with energy), and his more delicate songs, which were absolutely beautiful.

Even though the show itself was great, it wasn't the real stand-out point of the night. While I wouldn't say Vanderslice was the best show I've been to, it would certainly pass as the best <i>after-show</i>. As I said earlier, the crowd was incredibly small during the show, which created a great personal atmosphere throughout the entire thing. But after the show, the crowd thinned out even more, leaving us, about ten or twenty other people, and Vanderslice. Considering that, hey, I love his music and I've heard he's a great guy, I figured it couldn't hurt to talk to him for a bit. So, after I caved into the terrific CD + t-shirt for $20 deal, we went up to chat for a bit.

We talked for probably about a good five-ten minutes, and from that I can confirm one thing: John Vanderslice is indeed one of the nicest, coolest people on the planet. I find it interesting that many people associate independent songwriters, their fans, and this type of show with high levels of pretentiousness, but really, it's anything but, and Vanderslice is probably the strongest example to dispell that stupid rumor. John is the anti-thesis of pretentiousness; I couldn't imagine him ever, ever snubbing a fan. We talked about all the things in life that matter - you know, what it's like to be on tour, what the guys from Death Cab are like (he toured Europe with them before his US leg), what was his favorite country of all of the ones in Europe. And we also talked about the Pitchfork festival, which was, unfortunately, a bit of a sour note. Vanderslice regretted to inform us that, despite his best efforts, Pitchfork turned him down for the festival. Man, how lame is that? We told him that we thought it was everybit as much of a drag as he did.

I think the coolest part of the conversation, though, was that while we were talking about the tour, Cory brought up the possibility of him coming to Mt. Pleasant, and he, surprisingly, wasn't opposed to the idea. He actually kind of liked it - apparently, he likes doing smaller colleges. He's even doing some even smaller, no-name universities during this tour, and he said that we should just email his booking agent sometime next fall to try to get him for a show. Now, as somebody who's considering getting involved with the radio station, I couldn't imagine anything cooler than having John Vanderslice on campus. He'd certainly be leaps and bounds ahead of any musical act we've had this semester, and it might even earn him a few new fans. And after meeting him, it's impossible to hope for anything but great success for the man. He's just so damn, well, <i>nice</i>. And it's not fake, ridiculously-bubbly nice either; it's just the right mix of quirky and kind that makes it seem really, truly genuine.

If that's not enough to convince you of the quality of his character, he also brought in Easter cookies and Peeps for the audience. I mean, come on. Do I even have to say anything else?

I'll just close with one last thing that I feel best summarizes the John Vanderslice experience: If he does come on campus, I totally want to grab lunch with him.</lj-cut>

And as much as I'd love to go on about how terrific Vanderslice is as both a musician and a person, I've gotta get out of here. Scrubs is on!"

"event","Normally my Monday afternoons are tarnished by the fact that I only get five hours to do nothing, but this week is different - I had no astronomy lab tonight. Last week the TA decided to combine two labs into one evening, but, considering that not everyone can be pro scientists like Ashley or myself, he gave the class two weeks to complete both labs, allowing those finished with both to simply skip class. And, well, look at me now. This Monday afternoon has had the nothingness potential of a Wednesday or Friday. I feel I've made the most of it; hell, I'm even writing a livejournal post, which, scientifically, is the culmination of having nothing to do.

So what has been happening in my life, outside of the nothing?

Well, first off, I feel like I've hit a major milestone in my life. I've managed to, after months of searching every now and then, find a suitable video of the entire set of Beck with the Flaming Lips from Austin City Limits in 2002. I've yearned for the complete set ever since I saw a couple of videos on youtube way back when; and let me say, every bit of yearning was justified. It's great stuff. I think Wayne Coyne is the most interesting element of the entire set. Only in a couple songs does he ever play an instrument of any consequence. The rest of the time, he parades around the stage with something absolutely ridiculous, be it megaphone, spinning light on a rope, or two very bright flashlights. Yet, Wayne still feels like an integral member of the band. I don't know how he does it, but there's something about his charm that manages to become an instrument all of its own; Wayne Coyne is, in a way, playing Wayne Coyne, and that's all he needs to do. If Wayne were able to follow me around with a megaphone and flashing lights for an entire day, it wouldn't matter what I was doing - the day would instantly become enhanced by his presence.

Speaking of Austin City Limits, that's also where I've decided to base my potential haircut. It's a bit shorter than the previous pictures, which makes me nervous (short hair = me looking like I'm 15, not a day older), but I'm thinking about giving it a shot. It would, at the very least, allow me to go through the summer without needing to get another haircut. If you're that interested in my hair - which, if you're actually bothering to read this, is the NUMBER ONE thing on your mind - check out <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=BaiHpTG_Af4"">this</a> video to get an idea. It's also a great acoustic performance of ""Cold Brains"", although the Lips do nothing throughout the entire song.

I've got a crappy collage of screenshots ready to take to a barber somewhere. I'm still open to recommendations for a hair care place around Troy; actually, I'm not as much 'open' as I am 'desperate'. I'm going home this weekend, and I have absolutely no idea where I should trust a delicate procedure such as this. Back when I got my other haircuts, I always went to the same barber shop run by a bunch of old dudes; don't get me wrong, they're great guys and they did a fine job with my hair, but that was back when I would always cut it fairly short without any specific direction. They even said it themselves last time I was in the place: They're not experts on working with long hair.

But the trip home isn't the real highlight of the weekend. Admittedly, I haven't been home in over a month, and it'll be kinda nice to be able to remember the sweet, sweet feeling of free laundry, but all the dollar seventy-fives saved in the world couldn't compare to this weekend's climax: The John Vanderslice show. I'm, logically, excited to see the guy. I've listened through the mp3's on his site of his set in San Francisco, and while the live environment doesn't offer the impeccable producing quality seen on his albums, the music still sounds very, very good. And it's good to see that Vanderslice is an individual whose voice is everybit as pretty live as on album. So, really, I've run this through in my head, and I cannot think of one conceivable way this show could be bad. 

Also, it is my personal goal to meet and talk to Vanderslice about the smaller things in life. He seems like the kind of guy who'd be hanging around in the bar before his show, and we're definitely gonna be showing up early, so I'm hoping that, at some point in the night, our paths will cross. From there, I can only hope for about a minute of solid banter. It will be fantastic."

"event","First off, I've got big news. Admittedly, this entire update is filled to the brim with nothing but big news, but this is especially big news: The Flaming Lips have completed their newest music video. The video for ""The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song"", the first track off their new album, debuted on <a href=""http://launch.yahoo.com"">Yahoo Launch</a> earlier today.

It's quality stuff.

I've got to hand it to the creators of the video: When I heard that Wayne was going to be playing an evil king, I was a bit concerned. I wasn't sure if Wayne Coyne, certifiably nicest and greatest human being to ever live, could show even the slightest bit of cruelty. But they managed to make his torture so great and ridiculous that I'm willing to accept it; I could only imagine Wayne committing an evil act if its ridiculousness exceeded its wickedness, and, well, I think the video speaks for itself. I definitely know what I'm going to do if I ever find myself in the position of despot.

And, yes, I did just comment on the level of realism in a Flaming Lips video.

In tribute, I have changed my livejournal icon to Wayne in his regal wardrobe, complete with hat looking like it was stolen from The Watter Buffalo lodge in The Flintstones.

The new album, At War With the Mystics, officially comes out April 4th, and I'm excited. Sure, I know, I've had the album for nearly two months; I know how good it is, and I know that I don't like it quite as much as I do Yoshimi or The Soft Bulletin. But I promised myself upon clicking the torrent that I would purchase a legitimate copy as soon as I could, and, well, this is one promise I intend to keep. I've been a huge disappointment to myself many, many times over the past year or so - keeping this promise of legally purchasing a CD is a form of redemption for me. 

That, and the album artwork looks pretty neat.

In the last couple days of my internet use, I've stumbled on something great. Something grand. Something mindblowing. Something that requires a half an hour of your free time, but is totally worth it.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lWgXDOAJ5s&search=heat%20vision%20and%20jack

It's the pilot for a television show called Heat Vision and Jack. The show is directed and produced by Ben Stiller, and it stars Jack Black as a renegade space astronaut who has been given super-intelligence through solar radiation. And that's not all: It also features Owen Wilson as his talking motorcycle.

Just a little warning, though: When watching the show, it may feel like your brain is melting into mush. Don't worry - your brain isn't actually melting. Rather, it is absorbing ultraviolet radiation emitted from the video and tripling its cognitive ability.

I'm torn as far as a hair cut is concerned. I'm just not entirely sure what I want to do with it anymore. On one hand, I really want to go for the all-out Gustav mane - I miss the days of very long hair. But on the other hand, long hair is kind of inconvenient. It's warm in the summer. It's bad enough without feeling that every strand of hair is a solar panel. And worst of all, it severely cripples my ability to drive with the windows down, taking away one of my favorite parts of warm weather. I'm fairly sure it's hazardous to drive with hair constantly in your eyes, dancing around in patterns that make roughly half of the road half-visible. 

So here's where I turn to you, the people. What do YOU think I should do with my hair? If I do get it cut short, I'm thinking I'd go for something around the Beck look. I know, my eyes aren't quite as blue or mystifying, but I think it could look kind of decent and still be at the point where it's not inconvenient. Here are a couple of pictures:

</lj-cut>

Something to that effect. Anyway, help me out here! I'm not sure what to do! And if I do, where should I get it done? Does anybody in Mt. Pleasant or Troy have a recommendation? And more importantly, does anybody know of a hair place hip enough that I could get away with the hilarious joke of ordering ""The Devil's Haircut""?

I saw Tartuffe, CMU's most recent play, last night. Admittedly, I only really went because I needed to for my TAI class, and even then I did ushering work to get out of paying for it, but that play is really, truly worth every penny of the $5.50 ticket price. It was absolutely fantastic. I loved the script, and I couldn't imagine a better cast of actors. The costumes were every bit as extravagant as they needed to be, and the music was classy and very appropriate. I strongly feel that everybody at CMU should do everything in their power to see it sometime this weekend. 

Oh, and I got The Squid and the Whale from Family Video tonight. They actually had quite a few copies on the shelf, which made me happy: Maybe Mt. Pleasant isn't quite as bad as I thought it was. Or, at the very least, maybe their movie selection isn't as bad as I thought it was. Anyway, I really look forward to watching it, especially because certain friends of mine wouldn't shut up about how great the movie was and rubbing the fact that I couldn't see it in my face."

"event","God, I can't believe it's already Spring. It just seems like yesterday I was jubilantly celebrating the Winter Solstice, and now we're already at the start of new season. Not that I'm complaining by any means; I'm perfectly okay with not needing both a sweater and full length wool jacket to get to the point where I maintain feeling in all portions of my body. 

I feel Spring got off to a fairly decent start. The weather could have been slightly less brisk, but it was nothing my cheap lightweight jacket couldn't handle. The moderately fine spring weather got me thinking more than usual - thinking to the extent that I need not one, not two, not... actually, I'm not sure how many I'll need, but <b>more than one</b> livejournal cut. Step back.

<lj-cut text=""Historians"">
I managed to complete my history essay last night by two o'clock, which I feel is a major accomplishment, considering I knew next to jack shit going into it. I feel that, despite waiting until the last minute to start it, I was fairly responsible. I looked over the syllabus before starting the essay, just to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and it had some book listed next to ""see also:"". Now, in a desperate act to appear intelligent and prepared, I decided to check out this book and skim it for basic information. Well, surprisingly, it was incredibly helpful, and I managed to use a pretty decent amount of information from it throughout the essay. But more importantly, it gives me a second source on the bibliography page, and that just screams ""professional historian"". If he's not sold on my essay by the conclusion paragraph, that expansive bibliography page will give me the extra kick I need.

I'm not going to lie - reading fancy, smarmy history books is a borderline guilty pleasure of mine. I developed a taste for the stuff last semester with my French Revolution book, which was written by an author who explicitly stated at the start of the book that all other historians are full of shit and their theories on the French Revolution are for chumps and chumps alone. My current book lacks much of this cocky, self-assured nature; it's too objective, often looking at history itself as opposed to calling other historians dinks. But the book I checked out last night made up for everything. I don't think he went a single paragraph without writing some variation of the sentence, ""this is what other historians believe and hahahaha what the hell how can they believe this shit?"" And, I'll admit, their overly eloquent writing style also strikes a certain chord with me. I admire a writer who in an average sentence has triple the number of colons in the human body, mixed in between a blitzkrieg of commas. 

Historians are, without a doubt, the cockiest fuckers on the planet. It makes me want to drop journalism, broadcasting, or whatever I feel like majoring in two weeks from now and study pure history. Not even teaching - a pure, scholarly job in history. The kind of job where the only practical application is an interview for The History Channel. I want to do this just because I'd absolutely love to be invited to one of these history conferences I've heard so much about. Not because I'd like to debate with these guys; no, rather, I'd be perfectly satisfied simply being able to watch. I'm entirely convinced that the guy who wrote my French Revolution book would start throwing some punches if he had a couple drinks in him and somebody said economic factors were the primary cause of the Revolution, and I'll bet that Ancient Greek historian I read last night would start droppin' some killer zings like, ""oh yeah? yo momma held <i>isonomia</i> (equality by political rights) in the highest regard - it's the only way she could love you!"" It would be fantastic. And I all I would have to do is sit back and watch. 

Anyway, that's enough about historians. I think one of my new life goals is to write a history on historians. I'm sure it's been done - in fact, our school has a class entirely devoted to the craft of history - but what the hell do those other guys know? Every other history on historians is wrong except for this one. I haven't even written it yet, but I understand that, as a historian of historians, I need the mindset of a historian: in order for this to be an accurate account, I need to possess the mind-boggling self-righteousness of a historian: this is why I will prevail: also, my sentences need more colons.</lj-cut>

Moving on.

<lj-cut text=""Man Man and the perfectly crafted man."">I recently downloaded the Man Man album, Six Demon Bag. It's a pretty good and very unique album, but that's beyond the point. The point is that this band plays into every possible image that could lure me to listen to them. First off, their name is Man Man - that alone was awesome enough to get me to consider searching OiNK for a copy. But once You Ain't No Picasso posted an image of the band, I was instantly sold. I think the moustache-aviator combo speaks for itself:

<img src=""http://youaintnopicasso.com/images/mm.jpg"">

That is one of the best handlebar moustaches I've seen since the glory days of the 70's. The hair perfectly compliments the aviators, and his voice is every bit as gravelly and manly as you'd expect. If you're interested in hearing a sample, you know who to IM.

Working off this, I've created the image of the ideal man in my head. He is a combination of all of the best I've seen among my gender, rolled into one irresistible-to-the-ladies superman:

1. The moustache of Honus (the frontman; fuck, just look at that name, too!) of Man Man.
<img src=""http://youaintnopicasso.com/images/mm.jpg"">
2. The hair of Gustav Ejstes of Dungen.
<img src=""http://dungen-music.com/bilder/sommarhost_2005/00Brazil-2.jpg"">
3. The voice of <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=Yup-g38g6LQ&search=arrested%20development"">Will Arnet.</a> 

Now, I've yet to hire a professional artist to make a temporary mock-up of my superman, but I think it's safe to say that no female within a ten mile radius could resist him.
</lj-cut>

Also, last but most certainly not least, I'm considering getting a haircut sometime soon. Nothing major, don't worry. It would be a trim at most. My current problem is that, as of now, my goal of a Gustav-level mane (see above) is hindered by my hair's proportions. It's too short in the front and too long in the back - not quite business in the front, party in the back level, but you get my point. It needs to be shaped. I'm not entirely sure what I'll do with it yet, but I just figured I should give you guys a heads-up. Give adequate time to let it sink in.

By the way, if you've managed to read through all this entry, I think I might love you."

"event","Two weeks ago I was going through a rough time. It was midterm season, and I had two midterms back to back, neither of which I was ready for: History and Sign Language. Preparation be damned - I didn't read three chapters of the ""required"" reading for history and I hadn't touched my sign language book all semester. So, needless to say, exam day was interesting. But I had managed to complete the exams with enough competency to be at the level where I wasn't <i>entirely</i> dreading seeing the results after break. 

Well, today was that day I wasn't <i>entirely</i> dreading.

And there wasn't really a need to entirely dread it! In fact, the first of my exams, history, actually went quite well! I managed to pull a solid A on the exam. But not only did I pull the A,  I pulled the exact amount of point necessary to receive an A, meaning that I did just the right amount of reading and studying. Any more would have been excessive, any less would have put me at the frustrating A- mark; I was able to possess just the right amount of knowledge to give my professor, if I recall correctly, a slight look of shock when he saw that one of the A's belonged to the kid who always came to class fifteen minutes late because he was too lazy to wake up with ample time to both shower and eat lunch before class.

And not only that, but I pulled one of the proudest moments in my short answer BS-ing history. I completely missed the point on one of the questions, going on some entirely unrelated tangent. But here's the catch: My tangent technically had a little truth behind it, and my professor thought it was interesting, so he gave me a 7/10 on that part of the exam. In your face, knowing correct answers.

But the day wouldn't have been complete without a little reason to dread it. All of my dreading came to a climax when I received my sign language exam grade. 78%. Okay, that's not that terrible, all things considered. But my professor is one of those people who makes a chart of the grade spectrum on the board, and guess who was the little slash mark right at the bottom? That's right, I was. I managed to score below every single other person in the class. But, in my defense, the front page of the exam is kind of a crock of shit. I nailed everything except for the direct to English translations, and that's because I only know the basic gist of the signs, not their direct English counterparts. So I was losing points on stuff like writing the word ""warm"" instead of ""hot"". That was kind of a drag. Also, I mean, the class only has fourteen people, so I'm going to put a positive spin on all of this: The other thirteen students did very well. Way to go, rest of the class! I knew you had it in you!

So, yeah. Kind of a mixed bag. But on the plus side, I switched shampoo and conditioners. I'm now totally using chick hair care products, but it's the only way I can get the shine and bounce I so desperately need. So, regardless of the exam, one thing was always an A+: My hair while receiving the grade."

"event","Well, here I am. Nearing the end of my first college spring break. Many other college students plan massive road trips across the country, fly out to exotic locales, or get completely shit-faced every night; my spring break consisted of none of these. But I'd put my break up against theirs any day of the week. 

I guess it's appropriate to start at the beginning. The car ride home. Fairly run-of-the-mill, solid weather, a nice average of 80+ mph on the highway. We did, however, have more luggage than planned, but it was nothing we couldn't handle. Being the professional crammers we are, we managed to fit Ashley's unsuspected numerous bags of crap in the car with minimal rear view window blockage.

The weekend was nice and simple. Nate, Dan, and the rest of the U of M people were at the end of their break, giving us overlapping weekends. This allowed us to do the usual hanging out that we haven't done in a while; this translating to, of course, watching a number of movies Cory's house, including a completely ridiculous Chuck Norris film made even better by the completely ridiculous time of viewing at 1 in the morning. I don't even understand the villain's motive for blowing shit up, nor do I understand Chuck Norris's incentive for blowing them up, but I suppose that's beyond the point - that point being, of course, that shit blew up. Shit blowing up doesn't need an explanation, there should never be a ""how?"" or ""why?"" There should only be an ""awesome!""

The end of the weekend was where my true journey began. Sunday and Monday are what I like to refer to as the workin' man phase. Over those two days, I put more effort into finding a job for the summer than I ever have. That's not really a very high standard to beat, but I still think I did pretty alright. I applied at the usual pipe dream places: Two Barnes and Nobles and a couple of Gamestops. But I also applied at more realistic places as well, including Hollywood Video, Family Video, Einstein Bros, and Elaine's Bagels. Currently my best bet is looking to be Hollywood, as Pavan, my inside man, says they're desperate for work, and that if I call them up and ask them to review my application there's a good chance I'll be hired. The pay's not that great, but the work is easy and free movie rentals are too tempting to pass up.

Tuesday brought back my renegade, wild side you saw last entry with the theft of Family Video's phonebook. This time the unlucky victim of my disregard for the law was none other than my former high school: Athens. I found out a couple of days before that I had apparently ordered a yearbook back in August '04, and it would probably make sense to pick it up, so I decided I'd head over around lunch, eat with some of my younger friends, and grab the yearbook on my way out. Nothing wrong here, right? Wrong. Athens is an impenetrable fortress of education. The thought of allowing an alumnus to enter and associate with those learning is preposterous, and, in the eyes of Ms. Goss, Joe, and Gina, heresy! Just my luck that I would run into Ms. Goss, Joe, and Gina all lined up by the cafeteria door upon my entry. I made the foolish mistake of actually telling them that I graduated last year instead of playing the lie card of ""yeah, I just had to run out to my car, let me back in, I look like I'm 15, don't question me,"" and that shot down any dreams I could've possibly had of eating lunch with people. I wasn't even trusted to get the yearbook by myself - they had Gina escort me to the main office to pick it up. And then as soon as I got it, they immediately kicked me out of the building.

That's not the fun part, though. The second I exited, I decided to make a phone call to Kyle to tell him that I couldn't make it in and to tell everybody what a drag it is, so I just walked over to the side of the building to place a call. This was, of course, viewed by Gina as a hostile act, and the three of those fine security guards switched into Alpha Squad mode. According to my inside source, Kyle, Gina sprinted over the doors on the other side of the building in preparation for me to enter, and I saw Joe patrolling the courtyard on the way back to my car, and he immediately yelled a series of commands into his walkie talkie the moment he saw me. So it's only safe to assume that, if I had attempted to re-enter the building, I would've been shot down immediately by at least three snipers all targeted somewhere within my large head of hair.

Also, the year book is bad. Very, very bad. Awful, to use a stronger adjective. So it's safe to say that entire journey was tragic, not to mention that I had to wake up at quarter past 10 (early!!!) to get myself ready for the insanely early high school lunch. 

But I couldn't let that take down my entire break; no, the best was yet to come. The initiation of Concert Season: Spring '06: The double-header of Ted Leo & The Pharmacists and Of Montreal in the fine city of Ann Arbor.

By the way, when I say ""fine"", I'm not referring to city quality - I'm referring to how incredibly easy it is to get fined for a parking ticket, as half of the parking structures have the most ridiculous set of rules I've ever seen.

First, let me say what Cory and I eventually had to settle on, and keep in mind that this was the <b>best</b> option. We parked in a student lot that was free parking from 6 PM to 6 AM, then after Ted Leo we moved our car to an adjoining pre-pay visitor lot, where we had to pay 40 cents per half hour over a timespan of 16 hours. Then, the next day, we had to move our car back to the free student lot between 6 and 6:30 PM to avoid getting ticketed at the pre-pay lot. We then left Ann Arbor immediately after Of Montreal to avoid paying for the pre-pay lot again.

I don't even want to try to explain some of the parking lots we saw. A number of them were 40 cents per half hour all day, including our pre-pay lot, but that was way, way, way too much for us to pay, so we're just glad we managed to work around it for a good portion of our time. Also, even some of the 40 cents per half hour lots had their own ridiculous rules, a number of which involved the towing of cars, something we certainly did not want to have a part of.

Weekend Ann Arbor is much, much better than weekday Ann Arbor. Weekday Ann Arbor is about as welcoming to visitors as Athens is to their alumni.

Anyway, the shows! Wow... what a quality couple of evenings. In a way, I train for concerts. Rock concerts have long been the only practical application for long hair, so all the shampooing, conditioning, and brushing I've done since late October has all been a build-up to these two shows, where I would finally put that hair in action. Fortunately, both Ted Leo and Of Montreal gave me plenty of reason to whip that hair around, giving me two solid nights of rocking. I'm going to cut this part because I know that, of all the uninteresting things I write about, concert reviews are by and far the least interesting. 

<lj-cut text=""More rock than most livejournal cuts can handle."">Let me preface everything about these two shows by saying that the night before I left Ann Arbor I developed a killer sore throat. This is very, very bad for concerts, which, more often than not, involve lots and lots of screaming. So, uh, I was kind of bummed about that. But no pain, no gain, right? I would just have to be selective with my ""woo""s, ""yeah""s, and other shouts of encouragement, as I could only burn through so many. 

So here we go, Wednesday night, the car was parked, and it was time for...

<b>Ted Leo and the Pharmacists:</b> This was also, as far as I'm concerned, the Central Michigan University indie kids music festival. Nearly everybody that I'm aware of with similar tastes in music to mine was there, including Ashleigh, Brooke, and Audrey, all with their own groups of people. So it was nice to run into these people and, for a fleeting moment, feel like I was popular around CMU. 

But enough about the social aspect! I didn't pay fourteen dollars to mill around with people, I payed it to see Ted Leo... and because Ticketmaster, my only choice for getting tickets, charged an insane amount in service fees... but mostly to see Ted Leo! The openers were pretty alright, with the first band, some Spanish dude and his drummer, playing some of the loudest shit I've ever heard. It was the kind of stuff that makes The Flaming Lips circa 1980's look like conservative song-writers. It was borderline deafening, with every randomly placed guitar strum feeling like this man had it out for my eardrums. To give you an example, there was a point mid-way through the set when the Spainard played a recorder, smacking his guitar strings with said recorder in between squeaks. This was somehow not shocking. Also, judging by some of the lyrics, the only one I was able to make out being ""SMELL THE EYE!!!!"", I'm fairly sure this music was meant to be experienced with acid. Or at least pot. Sober as I was, it was just painful.

The second band was okay. I wasn't able to quite make out their name - every time the singer said their name it sounded like she was just mumbling something incoherent - but I suppose that's fitting. Their music wasn't really memorable in any way, shape, or form. But what was memorable was this drunk dude who decided to charge up mid-set and try to make the place into a mash pit. Let me explain something for you, in case you didn't know: The crowd that goes to see Ted Leo is, for the most part, not the type of people who enjoy mashing. Therefore, when this drunk man came stumbling up through the crowd and started shit, the crowd wasn't too enthusiastic with him.

But his friend was! That's right, this man had a friend, equally drunk and obnoxious as he. Together, they rammed into people and looked very out of place, as everybody around him was giving glaring death-stares. Fortunately, the second opener was done after a couple of songs with the two of them, and, being drunk as they were, they had to badly take a pee. It was at this point that everybody within a ten person radius of me banded together and promised each other to never, ever, under any circumstance, let either of them back through. We were to be a wall.

Our wall, fortunately, worked. We didn't see either of them for the rest of the night, which made Ted Leo a much, much more enjoyable show. Ted Leo's a good guy. He puts on a good show. His music is energetic, upbeat, and catchy. He's also a real charmer, talking about topics ranging from Project Runway to how much he hates certain idioms. In fact, one of the members of the audience baked cupcakes for him and the two other members in his band, which is a clear sign of this man's popularity. If I ever get to the point where strangers will make me cupcakes, I'll know I've made it in life.

Also, the bassist had some killer hair. Probably some of the best band hair I've seen since I first set eyes on Dungen. And the drummer had a killer beard, looking like Obi-Wan Kenobi crossed with Jesus. So, even though they didn't have nearly the stage presence of Ted Leo himself, the Pharmacists were at the very least an interesting looking batch of fellows.

All in all, a very good show. I enjoyed the songs, banter, and hair. Afterward, we went out to Jimmy John's with Ashleigh and her group of people, where I attempted to be a part of conversation despite my throat burning with the fire of a hundred suns and my vocal chords feeling like they were punching each other. But, I mean, I did the best I could.

So my voice was pretty shot. But I had enough left to run on, I could manage to recover enough for Thursday's show...

<b>Of Montreal:</b> I'm not sure if everybody who could possibly be reading this is familiar with Of Montreal. I think everybody is; I've certainly brought them up before. I've described them as ultra-sugary, super-sweet with a tint of psychedelic pop music.

I don't think that descriptor is enough to describe an Of Montreal live show. What they do live is, simply put, the musical equivalent of ingesting two dozen pixie sticks. In fact, I'm entirely convinced that the notes played in every single one of their songs has the same effect on the brain as the chemicals in sugar. I should conduct a study one of these days.

I'm aware of a certain chunk of older, conservative members of our society concerned about music demoralizing our youth; Of Montreal stands as a beacon of light in a sea of reprobates. Of Montreal is a classy act. Before the show began, the members of the group all set up on stage, sans one: The frontman, Kevin Barnes. The band then began to play the wedding march, as Kevin, wearing a wedding dress, entered the building. Once he completed this beautiful march, he stepped up to the mic to explain himself. You see, Of Montreal is a bunch of old-fashioned gals, and they would like to make sweet love to us, the audience, this evening, but we'd need to get married first. So, to solve this problem, he asked us if we'd take his hand in marriage - we, of course, enthusiastically yelled out ""I do!!"" Kevin put a ring on the finger of a lucky member of the front row, slipped into something more comfortable, and the show began. So there you go! Of Montreal is a firm supporter of abstinence and a prime role-model for today's youth!

The music was, as previously mentioned, a sugar rush. Every song equally as infectious as the last, it was hard to find a single head in the crowd not at the very least nodding; I, along with many others, went far beyond the simple head nod. I'm not much of a dancer, but much like after consuming a large quantity of sugar, it was hard to stand still. And singing along whenever possible was also imperative. It completely annihilated whatever was left of my voice, but I was able to, with great effort, make pitches that kind of matched with Kevin's. It was totally worth it.

But the real highlight of evening came not from Of Montreal's songs, but from a certain classic written by a small group by the name of Europe: The Final Countdown. That's right, Of Montreal did a cover of The Final Countdown. Kind of. Unfortunately, they didn't have the whole song down, but they were able to play enough of the opening riff to give the crowd a decent sample. This was enough to be a realization of one my life-long dreams: To be able to headbang to The Final Countdown performed live. The Final Countdown intro led into another one of their addictive pop tunes, but I didn't care; Kevin Barnes and his motley crew of musicians had already made one of my dreams come true, how could this night get any better?

Well, I'll tell you. During the second song of their encore, The Repudiated Immortals, during one of the times he sang the lyric, ""And I'll take care of you if you take care of me,"" Kevin looked and pointed directly at me. Sure, it could have been the person to the left of me, it could have been the person to the right of me; fuck, it could have even been Nate. But I keep replaying that exact moment in my mind, trailing the exact path of the his index finger, and it HAD to have been pointing toward me. Plus, I could see it in his eyes as I looked back at him. I, of course, acknowledged his offer and even slightly pointed back, because how could I expect him to take care of me if I didn't take care of him? 

And, to top off the fantastic night, I bought an awesome Of Montreal t-shirt. It's bright green, a color I feel has been sorely missing from my wardrobe.

So next on my concert list is Destroyer on Friday, March 24th. Currently, none of you jerks have expressed interest in going with me. So look alive, people! I promise you it will be a good time! Maybe you won't get married, maybe you won't hear The Final Countdown; but I guarantee you'll leave, at the very least, satisfied.
</lj-cut>

And now, here I am, today, the start of Friday. I've still got one more weekend of break left. I'm sure the best has come and gone, but I'm still up for anything this weekend. I just have to warn you: If you're expecting me to ""woo"" or yell any form of encouragement, you're out of luck."

"event","Scroll down to my last real entry, a couple entries down. Go ahead, take a look at it. That entry was written by a very different man than the one writing this. I've changed over the final week of February. Changed in ways that you may not be able to comprehend.

I've become a wanted man. That's right, I've had a little run in with Johnny Law. Last Saturday, Cory, Ashleigh, and myself went to Family Video to rent a movie, hoping to escape the complete drabness of Mt. Pleasant for, at the very least, 90 minutes. We got that temporary escape, but we also got much more: I can only assume that, by now, there are warrants out for our arrests. See, we wanted to get The Weather Man, but Family Video only had a full screen version. As anybody with any knowledge of film could tell you, this is absolutely disastrous - we owed it to the movie's director of cinematography to check the other video stores for a wide screen version. Of course, I wasn't about to just drive to the other local video stores; no, that would be far too fuel inefficient. The best way to check with the other video stores would, obviously, be the phone. I had my cell phone ready to go, but I needed the numbers to other stores. Fortunately, Family Video had a phone book at their front desk for just such an occasion. I called Blockbuster and Videoland, and both turned up nothing. We were forced to settle on the full screen version.

Feeling cold, tired, and defeated, I grudgingly paid the clerk $2.50 to have the full screen version for a night. I took my movie and walked out. Cory and Ashleigh followed. When we got in my car, Ashleigh asked where I had gotten that phonebook. I told her I got it from the front desk. She then held up the phone book, which she had, unknowingly, stolen. 

My heart began to race. There was no way they'd believe our story if we took it back! There's no way we'd ""accidentally"" walk out with their phonebook! They'd have the police on us in no time! I had no choice: I had to drive! It was our only hope!

And now, the illegitimate phone book rests on a shelf in Cory's room. It is not marked by any Family Video labels, so I can only hope that they cannot trace the crime back to us. But who knows? If I don't update over the next month, you'll know where I am. 

I've also become an actor. For Brooke's directing class, she needed actors for this short scene she has to produce as a project. She asked me for help, and I, as somebody with absolutely, positively nothing to do at this place, obliged. So, as of today, I am a struggling film writer from LA. I'm uncertain about any other details of the character, but I hope I can make a convincing writer. I hope I can be eccentric enough!

And I know what you're thinking: ""First modeling, now acting?! What is going on, man?!"" This is all, obviously, part of my lifelong dream to become Ashton Kutcher. I'm gunning for an MTV show by fall 2007.

I've become a knowledgeable historian on Ancient Greece up to the Pelopennesian War. Well, moderately knowledgeable, anyway; the kind of knowledgeable that could, hopefully, answer three of five short answer questions on the topic. The risky part here is that I still haven't read four of the ""required"" chapters for the class. I mean, I'm in a much better position than I was last entry (I've read seven of the chapters, putting me at where I should've been in early February), but it's still not entirely complete. But I'm a risk-taker. I think that, playing the odds, I'll have read enough to nail three of the questions. And even if it's not on something I've read, I still have my lecture notes to fall back on, which will hopefully fuel me with enough BS to complete the exam.

So look at me now. Criminal, actor, historian. A week and a half ago, I never would've saw myself in the position I am today. My life is moving at a mile a minute.

It was my freshman gym teacher Mr. Wylde who said, ""the body is like a car."" Working off that analogy, I should be running of gas any time soon. A mile a <b>minute?</b> That's 720 miles a day! There's no way my body has that kind of mileage! Good thing that in a couple of days I have spring break, where I'll have a full week to refuel. However, gas isn't cheap. And my life is <i>probably</i> an automatic, not a manual, so I mean, I might only be able to afford 3/4 of a tank. Or maybe only 1/2.

Actually, forget this. That was the worst analogy ever. Fuck you, Mr. Wylde.

Anyway, spring break is going to rule. I'm going to two fantastic concerts, which will open up my first concert season of 2006. Here's a full list of shows I'm considering attending. This is mostly for my reference, but if you feel like accompanying me to any of them, feel free to let me know.
<lj-cut text=""Concert Season Spring '06!"">
Ted Leo and the Pharmacists - Wed, March 8 - Ann Arbor
Of Montreal - Thurs, March 9 - Ann Arbor
Destroyer - Fri, March 24 - Ann Arbor
John Vanderslice - Sun, April 16 - Kalamazoo
Built to Spill - Thurs, April 27 - Detroit

This list may shrink depending on ticket prices and class conditions for days following, but this is, by my knowledge, a comprehensive list of all the good bands coming through Michigan, sans larger, more expensive shows. If you think I'm missing anything, be sure to tell me.</lj-cut>

Well, that's all I've got for tonight. I wish I could promise to tell you how the concerts go, but with the way my life is going, who knows where I'll be in a week? Maybe I'll be an astronaut! Cross your fingers, guys!"

"event","I'm not saying that because I didn't have a good time or because I felt the trip home was a waste, I'm saying that because I never did the one thing I promised myself I would do: Read some of my backlog of the now hundred-plus pages of history. Actually, my original goal was to have it all read by tonight, but as the weekend went on, my goal gradually became more and more realistic. I feel this table best describes the process:

<b>Day</b>: <b>Goal
---------------------------</b>
Friday: Read all of that history! Study study study!
Saturday: Alright, alright, maybe I was a little overzealous. If I finish half of my reading this weekend, I should be in good shape.
Saturday Night: Okay, I can do a quarter of the history. That's fair.
Sunday Morning: Hmmm... alright, I'm not leaving until five, I have time to read twenty or so pages.
Sunday Afternoon: I still have a little time, maybe I can get a couple of pages in...
Sunday Evening: Hahahahahahaha! History! 

And now, as you can tell, I'm at the point where I'd rather write in my livejournal about not doing history than do history itself. Ah well, this entry still stands as the most productive thing I've done all weekend - at least I have something to show for this. I have a history mid-term the Thursday before Spring Break, giving me a little over a week and a half to pull my act together. Can I do it? Sure. Will I do it before the night before the exam? Doubtful.

That said, here's some of the non-productive stuff I did this weekend:

I had my first cup of coffee ever. Or latte. Does latte count as coffee? I don't understand the world of Starbuck's. But anyway, I went there with Kyle on Friday night as the end result of having nothing better to do, and I looked like such a newbie. The workers could tell right away, as, unlike every other person to enter a Starbuck's, I didn't know what I wanted; in fact, I dawdled for a good five minutes before deciding on the ""Cinnamon Dulce Latte"" or however it's spelled. And not only that, but when I did finally place my order, it was a verbal trainwreck. I still have no idea how to say ""Dulce"". I'm fairly sure I mumbled something completely unintelligible, but fortunately they were able to fill in the blank between ""Cinnamon"" and ""Latte"" and take my order. To top it all off, I didn't get one of those cardboard things that goes around the cup, so even while I was drinking it people could tell I was a rookie.

All that aside, I did enjoy the experience. The drink was fairly good (and this is coming from a guy who's generally not a fan of warm drinks), and the atmosphere was pretty nice. I couldn't imagine ever drinking the stuff by myself, but I could definitely see myself returning to Starbucks or some form of coffee shop. Besides, if I ever want to achieve my life goal of complete and utter pretentiousness, I imagine a taste for coffee is a must.

I also had Red Lobster with my dad earlier today, but this isn't nearly as significant an event, especially because I've ordered the same thing for the past fifteen years of my life: Popcorn shrimp. But, I mean, popcorn shrimp is quite delicious, and it stands as one of the best meals I've had in a while. 

Also, I've become incredibly involved with the Winter Olympics. Well, at least when NBC is airing them at 3 in the morning. I'm amazed at how interesting speed skating becomes late at night while waiting for spaghetti to finish warming in the microwave. Before last night, I could never have imagined myself caring about the Winter Olympics, <i>especially</i> speed skating of all things, in the slightest. But lo and behold, come 4 in the morning I was fighting back the urge to scream, ""Fuck you, North Korea!"" at the TV.

To end the weekend, after nearly a month of trying to locate one of the three DVDs up for rental in Mt. Pleasant, Cory and I have finally gotten a copy of The Aristocrats on DVD. Until midnight tomorrow night, this baby is all ours. I, for one, am very excited.

So, yeah. Good weekend. Unproductive, sure, but hey, that's how I like 'em.

I feel I should share this with the livejournal world. Last Wednesday afternoon, I took the first step toward becoming a full-fledged male model: I had my first modeling gig. Alesa needed somebody to pose for her some project in her Photojournalism class, and I, being the prettiest person she knows, was the clear choice. Here are some of the highlights:

"event","God, I can't believe it's already that time of the year again! February 14th - the day when February is, officially, half over.

I know, you're as sick of February as I am. Who isn't? Just take a look at March and April! They're looking to be great months for concerts; what, with Ted Leo, Of Montreal, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, AND Built to Spill all crammed in 61 days of fun and games. And they should be solid months for new music, too. Built to Spill's releasing their new album, The Flaming Lips (technically) are putting out At War With the Mystics, and I think there might even be a new Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Secret Machines floating around somewhere in there. But the fun doesn't stop there! What comes right after March and April? Summer. That's right, the end of a full year of school. No wussy three-week Christmas break - we're talking a full three months of relaxation and, unfortunately, having a job. But, hey, life can't always be perfect.

So get out of the way, February! I've felt this way about February for <b>years</b> now, as it's been nothing but an unnecessary obstacle in the way of bigger and better months. So join with me in celebrating today, February 14th. We're halfway through this lousy month; if we've made it this far, we can surely make it to the 28th. And then it's all clear skies and sunshine from there.

"event","As many of you know, last night was the Arrested Development ""season"" finale. This was an emotional night for me. I've praised the show, I've fought for it; fuck, I even signed an online petition, which is something I usually find to be exceedingly pointless. Of course, those efforts proved to be worthwhile, as FOX agreed to air a third season of Arrested Development. It's safe to say none of this would have happened without my one signature on that e-petition. So, needless to say, I have a special connection with the third season of Arrested Development, which came to a close last night.

But first, if you look back to the first line of this entry, you'll notice quotes around ""season"". That's because the third season of Arrested Development is, quite possibly, the last. The show is being canceled by FOX, and, despite a very strong offer from Showtime, the creative staff isn't sure if they want to continue. Mitchell Hurwitz, the creator, has stated that the show is a lot of work, and that he feels it may have run its course. And while he's officially still ""considering"" continuing, the writing in the finale shows otherwise.

That said, this is by no means a bad thing. The Arrested Development season finale created one of the strongest feelings of closure I've felt since The Office finale, bringing nearly every plot point to the forefront and tying them all together. Things I ruled out as simple one-time jokes suddenly became incredibly relevant to the plot; the Arrested Development plotline, in a way, became a work of art. Seeing the finale made me want to re-watch every episode of the past three seasons to catch all the hints I missed. 

I'm not sure how Hurwitz and crew could continue the show from this point. Sure, they could go on with the plot, there are now a whole new batch of points they could expand on. But there's no denying the total feeling of completion and satisfaction that came in the final half an hour that was the finale. Honestly, as much as I'd love to be cranky and demand more upon more episodes of Arrested Development, I'd be satisfied if they stopped here, because, well, it's perfect. The show became perfect.

Also, I mean, three seasons comes out to 53 episodes. That's 26 and a half hours of near-bliss; how much more can we ask for? I compared the finale of Arrested Development to that of The Office, but I think the shows have more in common than their finales. The Office lasted a mere two seasons, giving a total of 12 episodes. That was it. And yet I firmly believe it's one of the strongest shows to ever be on TV. Why? Because in those 12 episodes, it managed to create a concrete, brilliant plot. It didn't need anymore. Arrested Development has done the same over 53 episodes. While I'd be up for more, I don't feel it ""needs"" it. This isn't like Firefly, which got nipped in the bud. Arrested Development had the chance to, well, develop.

So I bid you a possible farewell, Arrested Development. It ain't easy bein' white, it ain't easy bein' brown; it ain't easy bein' the most underrated television show in town."

But the case is over now, the verdict ancient past; I feel I have gained a couple of grey hairs in the process, but justice has been served. I retire from my position as a supreme justice.

I am now just a humble servent of the livejournal state, working to keep you informed about a bunch of shit you don't care about. That said, here's what's been going on in my life lately:

I am officially way behind on my Ancient Greece and Rome reading. I was looking through the syllabus, and I'm a good five chapters behind, in addition to outside readings that range anywhere from twenty pages to three paragraphs. As a professional in not doing history until the last minute (see: Marr's class sophomore year), I can tell you right now that I don't like where this is heading - we've got an essay in a couple of weeks, a midterm in a few weeks, and more reading that just piles on every day. I think I'm going to make an actual effort to read through about three of my chapters tomorrow. I've got it all planned out: 1) Go to Astronomy. 2) Go to lunch. 3) Go to TAI. 4) Go to library and read the hell out of history book. 5) Go to dinner. 6) Read even more of history book. 7) Go to bed, content in the knowledge that I'll have awesome dreams about being a gladiator high-fiving Jesus in his spare time.

Ann Arbor was all kinds of wild and out of control times. I love that city. If it didn't cost more money than I'll ever make to go there, I totally would. But for now, the occasional trip will have to suffice. And did this trip ever suffice! It contained all the Ann Arbor usuals (high school buddies, nate's friends, quiz dragons) and a few new thrills (fancy pizza restaurant, taboo, blimpy burger). Speaking of which, Blimpy Burger is the single most perplexing hamburger restaurant you could ever hope to eat at. The food's good, but I have to warn you, it's not easy. 

Blimpy Burger is not easy to order. The lady making the burgers has an air around her very similar to the Soup Nazi of Seinfeld fame, only greasier. I thought I had it down. I was going to say 'double, kaiser bun, cheese' and she would simply make my hamburger, no heckling involved whatsoever. But it turns out you don't order cheese until later in the burger assmebly line! I had some very harsh words thrown at me for thirty seconds following my order. It was traumatizing. 

Blimpy Burger is not easy to eat. After we ate our meal, we couldn't do anything but sit around Nate's dorm room for about three hours afterward. And that was after the horrible, painful trek back across the street to Nate's dorm room.

Blimpy Burger is not even easy to purchase. The change on Cory's order consisted of two two dollar bills and a fifty cent piece. One of Nate's friends received another two dollar bill.

Blimpy Burger is, without a doubt, the most challenging food experience on the planet. Blimpy Burger: Can <b>YOU</b> handle it?!

I've got a serious problem. Over the past week, for the second time this year, somebody from Central Michigan University has <b>removed me from their facebook friends list.</b> This hurts. It's disturbing to think that, in a community where friends are made by a simple poke, I can't even keep socially afloat. I don't know what it is that makes people want to go out of their way to make sure they'll never see me on their friends page ever again. I'm not very high maintainance. I update my facebook once or twice a month; it's not like I'm cluttering up your ""recently updated"" friends page. I haven't added pictures to my photo album in well over a month, so I'm not taking up room on your photos page. I'm the perfect internet friend! I don't see what I'm doing wrong!

Ah well, at least I know who my <b>REAL</b> 62 friends are. I don't need those jerks. You hear me, two people who have removed me from facebook over the past semester? I don't need you! I never did! I accepted your friends request out of pity! And if I sent the friends request... that was out of pity, too! You bite the hand that feeds you!

"event","It is my pleasure to announce that tonight's astronomy lab didn't go nearly as poorly as last week's. We were far from the first group done; in fact, we weren't very far from being the last group done, but point being, we weren't the <b>very</b> last group. And we beat the old guy, by just a little. He, technically, turned in his lab before we did, but he stayed to chat it up with the TA afterwards, so as far as I'm concerned it was a victory for team Brian-Ashley. Rather than being a seven paragraph disaster, tonight was a one paragraph moderate success. Sure, we stumbled a bit, confusing fine adjustment knobs for declination spheres, but we were out of there within the hour.

Also, on that note, the old man is becoming a much more prominent character in the class. Tonight's lab involved looking around at various telescopes and locating all kinds of knobs and junk, so everybody was a bit more social than usual, as we normally just keep the talking within our lab groups. The old man was one of the more talkative members of the bunch; he actually, shames me to say, recognized a good number of the telescope parts before Ashley or I did. And not just that, he <i>helped</i> us with the lab. We were stumbling around with the reflector telescope trying to figure out what the lab manual meant by ""(inside)"", and he overheard our hopeless chatter and told us it was a mirror. A parabolic mirror, to be exact.

He's good.

And not just that, but for the five minutes before the TA started his lecture, the old man was looking directly at the back corner Ashley and I sit at. Just staring. Could he possibly be reading my journal? Could he have read my remarks on an astronomy lab mid-life crisis? I don't know, but there's only one way to find out. Old man in my astronomy lab, if you're reading this, next time you stare at our corner, cough and give us two winks. Do the winks back-to-back as soon as you see me look over. That will be the signal.

But enough about astronomy, there are more things in my life than astronomy:

Food! There has been some downright great food on campus over the past week. Don't get me wrong, it's still the usual crap for the most part, but there has been the occasional shimmer of greatness. Thursday lunch - popcorn chicken. Need I say more? Also, last night, giant oatmeal raisin cookie from the muncherie - it was one of the softest, chewiest, and delicious-iest cookies I've had in ages. Not only that, but I think the Frosted Flakes in the cafeteria have been <i>extraordinary</i> as of late. I'm not talking more than good - fuck, I'm not even talking great. I'm talking <b>more than great.</b> This is a level Tony the Tiger has been yearning for for years!

Jim Gaffigan put on one hell of a new Comedy Central special last night. Of course, all of you would know this; everybody who reads this HAS to be a Jim fan after all the ranting and raving I did about his show last September. I'm sure you signed up for the email list right away, I'm sure you've been counting down to this day since early December... but, hey, I know we're not all perfect. I've got a reader base ranging from high schoolers to fifty year old men. So, just in case you had a schedule conflict, somehow causing you to miss BOTH times they aired it last night, let me give you a sample: Pandas, cake, hot pockets, Jesus, and more! It had everything you could possibly want, and Jim was looking exceptionally pale that evening. If you missed it, stop reading this right now and turn to Comedy Central - there's a one in ten chance they'll be airing a re-run at the time you're reading this. Or better yet, if you can't catch a re-run, buy his new DVD coming out February 7th. As if the special wouldn't wow you enough, the DVD has 20-some minutes of added material, in addition to (I believe) somewhere around an hour of special features, including a segment with Jim eating a hot pocket. Of course, I'll be buying it. Sure, I've seen three-quarters of the material on the DVD and probably heard the rest of it at my school, but come on. Jim eating a hot pocket. He talks the talk, but can he walk the walk?! Only one way to find out! Purchase Jim's new DVD - support the best talent in stand-up comedy this side of Mitch Hedberg's grave.

First Ann Arbor trip of '06! After a couple minutes of hard thought, I've decided to slot my first trip to Ann Arbor of the year for this upcoming weekend. I haven't been around there since Broken Social Scene / Ben Folds hyper-weekend, so it'll be nice to get back there. I've almost forgotten what civilization feels like. So far my car-load includes me, Cory, and Ashley. I've still got one open slot, so if any of you Mt. Pleasanters reading this want a ride down there and can arrange your own place to stay, I can give you a ride down there for the weekend. Think about it: Record stores, sandwich shops, art theaters... everything Mt. Pleasant isn't. Also, we're currently looking for a place for Ashley to stay because Ellen's a jerk and is going to some overnight thing on Friday, so if you can do anything about that, be sure to let me know. Currently I've talked to one of the guys I met down there through Nate over AIM and I can crash on his floor for a night if I need to, freeing up valuable floor space for Ashley, so that's the tentative plan. If you've got anything better, don't hesitate to IM or comment.

Well, that's all I've got to say for now. I think I've made up for a full week's worth of scrolling.

"event","We showed up to class five minutes late. Not <b>that</b> bad of a start, I guess. We didn't miss much. Then the TA began his lecture, which both of us have found as absolutely, positively, certainly, completely impossible to follow. Not because it's poorly explained or anything, but just because it's so incredibly uninteresting that it's hard to keep from flipping through the lab manual, playing with a mechanical pencil, or intently watching the one fifty or so year-old guy who's in the class. Which, by the way, after about ten minutes of deep thought I still can't figure out. Why would he be here? He's, like, fifty. He doesn't need to learn about constellations, celestial spheres, and planispheres. Maybe it's some form of mid-life crisis. Rather than waking up one day and deciding to get a Corvette, he decided to take a Astronomy course. It sounds feasible to me. Fuckin' dorkiest mid-life crisis ever, but hey, I'm not one to judge. I'm sure my mid-life crisis won't be anything spectacular.

Anyway, after about ten minutes of thoughts like this, it was time to get to work on the lab. Which, uh, we had no idea what we were doing. Also, we didn't have a planisphere, which we were apparently supposed to buy from the bookstore, so we had to ask the TA if we could borrow his.

This was, of course, after a few minutes of heated debate of the pronunciation of ""planisphere"". I didn't want to look like an idiot (this would happen later) when I asked him, and I could've sworn it was ""planETsphere"" (that makes sense, like, you know, planets? stars? it seemed reasonable at the time), but I eventually bought into Ashley's ""planisphere"" theory. It turned out to be right, so I'm definitely glad I didn't go with planetsphere. It was all okay; we were still looking like a professional science team.

Then we started working on the lab, and holy hell, it was the easiest shit on the planet, yet we still had <b>no idea</b> how to do it. We eventually managed to force our way through the Celestial Sphere portion of the lab with only a couple of questions to the TA, but the planIsphere was initially the most ridiculous thing I've ever worked with. Having not listened to the lecture what-so-ever, and the book doing little to help, it was the most daunting series of numbers, dates, stars, and lines I've ever seen. We messed around with it for about fifteen minutes and still were nowhere on the first question.

During this time, a number of people finished the lab and began to leave the class.

Ashley and I eventually sucked it up and asked the TA what the hell ""draw a line for the sun"" meant in the lab manual, and we nailed that. We were ready to go. We had our sun in place, our planisphere rotating clockwise, and those questions were going down. That is, until we realized that, outside of setting the sun, we still had no idea what we were doing. So we fiddled around for an additional twenty minutes.

During this time, more people finished the lab and left the class.

We continued our struggle with the planisphere. Eventually, we caved and, once again, asked the TA a question. Turns out the horizon is, in fact, not the part right under the word ""horizon"", but the entire line where the stars become visible. You know, the part that makes a lot of sense to be the horizon. So we began to work on those questions until we, once again, had no idea what we were doing. 

During this time, the fifty year-old man finished the lab and left the class.

We had two questions left. It was 8:15. We were the only group left in the class, sans the group that was working with a girl who showed up an hour late. We just had to find the constellation that crossed the meridian at midnight on some night. It should've been no sweat. We fumbled around with the concept of meridian until the TA, seeing us sweating it out and almost writing down ""big dipper"" (which isn't even an actual constellation!) for an answer, decided to bail us out. After what was almost guess and check, we got the constellation. And we wrote it down, basking in the glory of our victory over Lab #2. Of course, I misspelled it a couple of times, but that didn't make the moment any less glorious. We did it.

We had one question left, but by this point we had finally gotten a hang of the planisphere, so we finished that last question in about the same amount of time it took the class to do the rest of the questions. A major feat for Ashley and I.

I handed in both of our papers, assuring the TA that there was no way we had anything less than a hundred percent. Full credit, zero dignity; just the way I like it.

Oh, and for the record, I was thinking about cutting this story. I almost did. Kyle convinced me not to, so if your finger's sore from scrolling through all of this, please blame him. 

But before I finish this post, a few life points, in brief:

- I found out that my retainer CAN be fixed, which is nice. It's only 50 bucks to have it fixed as opposed to the 160 for a new one; sure, my dad's covering it, but there's no reason he should have to pay 110 dollars more than he has to. The downside: I still have to go home again to make sure it fits. I'm currently scheduled for a week from Wednesday, which means, weather willing, I'll be pulling another pointless trip to Troy. Awesome.

- Tomorrow we're discussing CNN's news coverage last Thursday from 3:45 to 4:30 in my journalism class. I've got nothing against what I saw; I still think cable news is kind of boring, but Wolf Blitzer and his crew don't seem like too bad of a group. If chosen for the discussion panel (my professor picks randomly), I'm thinking about opening with ""Wolf Blitzer's coverage was as rich and full as his beard."" I can only hope a strong opening statement like this will quell any possible opposition.
 
- A number of my friends are Arrested Development fans, and I strongly feel they should all watch this. As Arrested Development fans, you're cranky. You're angry with Fox. The best show on TV by no means deserves to be cancelled. <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3672205260912971901&q=david+cross"">I believe David Cross speaks for us all.</a>"

I've managed to narrow it down to three choices:

But it was a pretty alright weekend. Sure, the Wes Anderson marathon never happened, meaning that it has now been a semester <b>and</b> a week in the planning, but I think something like this can only get better with age. Our marathon is now a week older, a week more refined; whenever we do get around to having it, it will go without a hitch. A marathon that will put even AMC's week-long Bond marathon to shame.

On the plus side, I played mafia with Cory and a bunch of people from his hall, and it was a pretty wild time. I pulled off a brillaint mafia victory that would only go to curse my career as a townsperson every other game because nobody would take my word on anything, but the state of the town isn't the real point here. It's the state of the kingdom. More specifically, the United Kingdom. I've met, certifiably, one of the most British people on the planet. He's from Liverpool and is at Central for some reason. He likes soccer, talks with an accent, and finds it funny when people call dollars 'bucks'. And if that's not enough, he, apparently, didn't know what 'douchebag' meant, and now that he knows, he goes around calling people douchebags. I was on the receiving end of one of these comments after calling him out on being mafia, and let me tell you, it was awesome.

Anyway, he's definitely my new favorite person on campus. We talked about music and pop culture, and he told me a couple of British rock people I look like, now bringing my ""brian looks like this guy"" count to somewhere around twenty different people. He's also a fan of The Office and knows the David Brent dance, which, I guess, is a given for the most British guy ever. He also told me about this other show (can't remember the name) that he was a fan of, but his DVDs are in region 2, so I can't borrow them. 

Between him and my Dutch professor, I feel I have a more enlightened view of the world. This view definitely makes me want to leave the country at some point, maybe even live in England for a little bit. I don't know exactly how I'd go about doing this, but if I do wind up being a journalist, I feel I'd be able to adapt to the British press. I'm fully able to add a 'u' to 'color', call 'garbage' 'rubbish', and name every new band as the saviors of rock and roll. Also, free health care, how cool is that?

But enough about my ridiculous ambitions, let's talk about what's crushing my spirit today. 

For starters, I just found out that I need to come home on Wednesday. And not to stay home or enjoy myself, but to get fitted for a new retainer. My old retainer, after going strong for two solid years, busted in the front a few days ago, leaving my teeth to total anarchy over the last couple of nights. Those bicuspids are up to something, I swear. I know a bunch of you guys think I'm nuts for actually caring about my retainer, but I've been wearing my retainer religiously this entire time. Sure, I haven't always been perfect to the Othrodontic God, but I'm not the dental equivalent of the guy who only shows up for the Christmas and Easter service. The way I see it, I spent a year and a half with braces to earn that smile you see today. I'm not about to blow it because I don't feel like sticking something in my mouth every night.* So that's that, I need to skip all of Wednesday's classes to go home for a stupid orthodontist appointment, making my first day in my TAI class the Friday the week after school started. Awesome.

Also, I found out that I washed a pair of jeans while candycanes were in the pocket, leaving my left pocket totally fucked up and sticky. Bah.

But it's all okay. You know why? Because I've found the ultimate in therapy. It's free, it's easy, and it's painless. It's <a href=""http://media.spin.com//features/band_of_the_day/video/2006/01/bllt_be_gentle_hi.mov"">this video,</a> the most undeniably borderline-nausiatingly-cute video ever. Have a bad day, cranky because things aren't going your way, or even upset because you've just read a livejournal entry that really hasn't gone anywhere? Just watch this and it will all be better. Personally, I've saved a copy to my harddrive in case this link goes down. I'd recommend doing the same, just to be safe. After all, if the link goes down, wouldn't it just really eat you up inside, making you, in a way, need this video more than ever? Preparation is the first step to defeating irony.

"event","A week of class has now come and gone, I've now experienced a fair chunck of what the semester has to offer, so it's my duty to write a brief paragraph or two explaining my expectations for each class:

<lj-cut text=""16 Credits of Madness"">
<b>Astronomy 111: Basic Astronomy:</b> <i>Very</i> basic astronomy. On the first day of class my professor came right out and said that there would be next to no math involved in the course. That means the entire class is basic, easy astronomy concepts. That's fine with me. It's also my first real lecture hall class! So far, all of my classes have been the same size or double that of the usual high school setting; nothing really different than what I was used to. But this was a legitimate, 100-something person lecture hall. I've heard a number of things about lecture halls, and I gotta say, I definitely see some of the charm. It's easy; I can just listen to the lecture and never have to worry about contributing to a discussion or anything. It's a relaxing way to start my Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Also, Ashley's in my class, making it the first class where I've known somebody going into it. It's handy to have somebody to fall back on for lecture notes. Although, I swear, Ashley, if you cheat off me on one of the exams, our friendship is over. Yes, I know it's tempting, but think of your academic integrity.

<b>Astronomy 112: Astronomy Lab!:</b> I'm putting that exclamation point at the end of the class title for irony's sake. I have quite possibly the least enthusiastic TA ever teaching the class. He wanted us to do a lab the first week since we won't have class next week because of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but he realized that we didn't have time to read over it beforehand, so he decided to lecture through it. Man, it was obvious from the first time he said ""celestial sphere"" that he didn't really feel like doing it. In fact, he actually stopped partway through and just said, ""yeah, I know I suck at this, but I'm better one on one, I promise."" The lab we did was easy enough - it was more or less a cosmic scavenger hunt, and Ashley and I are the greatest sceince team ever, so we got through it no sweat. And the TA's still a pretty good guy. I asked him a couple of questions and he was helpful, and he's not a jerk or anything, so I've got nothing against him. Hey, he's gotta pay the grad student bills somehow, and I know I would care about as much as him were I in his situation, so I feel I identify more with him than any of my actual professors. 

<b>History 238: Ancient Greece and Rome:</b> Holy crap, sweetest professor on the planet. And when I say planet, I mean planet - this guy is over here for a semester from some university in Holland. I knew something was up when I couldn't find him on ratemyprofessor, but... Holland? He's one of those pure, hardcore history types, too. The first day of class, he went into this big schpiel about how he thought that periodization was biased, and that by saying ""Classical Era"", we're discriminating against all the other eras of ancient history. New-wave Dutch thinking, clearly. His grading scale seems fair, and I'm sure his lectures will be interesting enough, so this class scores a definite thumbs-up with me.

Oh, and just in case you were wondering, his English is fairly good. Sure, he's not exactly the fastest talker, and he stumbles from time to time, but he's still consistantly coherent. Besides, after having my French-Romanian French Revolution professor, I don't feel it would be a history class if the professor had flawless English.

<b>American Sign Language Level 2... Honors!</b> The usual, more or less. The class is smaller than before, and I'm now the only guy in the class, meaning that the testosterome level has been cut by about three-quarters because the guy from level one had a killer beard. But, hey, nobody said college was easy. Also, this semester we're doing a massive class-wide poster instead of a research paper. We assigned parts for the project, so this next part of the entry is more for me than anybody:

<i>You're in charge of deaf history from 1850-1900. God, I can't believe you forgot. You're relying on an old livejournal entry to remember what you're supposed to do for a class-wide project. Way to let everybody down, man. I bet everybody else has their part ready to go, and here you are, scavengering through old entries to figure out what the hell you need to do. You bring shame to American Sign Language Level II.</i>

Oh, and I think this is pretty awesome. We do two ""deaf culture experiences"" a semester and write a credit/no-credit one-page paper on each experience. Normally we just watch a video or something, but this semester, there's a huge deaf theater production going through Alma college. I get to watch a deaf play on Sunday, March 26th. Oh, and hey! I can get extra seats, if anybody's interested. I mean, I doubt anybody else cares, but if you've got nothing to do and want to try something completely different, let me know. I think it could be, at the very least, an interesting time. 

<b>TAI 170H: Fundamentals of Interp. Reading... Honors!:</b> Uh, geez. I wouldn't know. I haven't been to the class yet. I couldn't go the first day because our school's stupid online scheduling system crashed so I couldn't figure out where I needed to go. And then I found out that it was cancelled for the rest of the week, and I'm not going to have it on Monday because of the three-day weekend, so I'm not going to be at one of my classes for the first time until next Wednesday. But I've got the same professor as I did for my speech class, and I know one other person in the class, so I think it'll be pretty good. I'm just hoping I don't have to buy to many stupid books of poetry and plays.

<b>JRN 101: Introduction to Mass Media:</b> Let me start by saying that, unlike every other section of JRN 101, this class does not require a book. My professor, more or less, saved me 65 dollars before I met him. When somebody saves you 65 dollars, it doesn't matter if you agree with his attendance policy or not - it's hard to walk away disliking the man. That said, I don't really like his attendance policy. The grade is almost entirely based on attendance in class, which is fine, but he gives NO excused absenses. He said it himself - if you have a funeral, go, but you're going to lose points that you can't earn back. I kind of wish there was some way to do make-up work, because, knowing my luck, I'll become severely ill right after the deadline for dropping the class without penalty. I like the professor, though. He seems fairly relaxed, and he says he wants to create a more informal atmosphere, even though the class has about 70 students. Small group work a plenty!

So that's my schedule for the semester. Compared to last semester, it wins in some places, loses in others. For one, I took 13 credits last semester. Any way you look at it, that's an easy courseload. But I think that I, on the whole, like the courses this semester more - I grew to hate that stupid film class, particularily because it fell right during all of dinner hours every Tuesday evening. We'll see, hopefully I won't wind up loathing anything this semester.
</lj-cut>

A couple of other, non-school related points:

I got a Jens Lekman CD from Ashleigh (girl with similar music tastes from a few entries back), and I like the guy. I wouldn't say he's quite up there with Gustav and Co., but he's still a fairly talented Swede. 'Black Cab' is one of the most infectious songs I've heard in a while, and I think ""it's like someone spilled the beer all over the atmosphere"" might be one of my favorite lyrics of all time.

It's hard for today not to be a drag. I don't know about Troy/Ann Arbor/Kalamazoo/Vancouver/Wherever-you're-reading-this-from, but yesterday had some of the best weather I've seen in a while. There was a slight breeze, the sun was out, it was a confident low to mid 60's. It was the kind of day that puts most days in April to shame, and in the middle of January? It's a shame it couldn't last long. Now it's cold, rainy, sleet-ey, snow-ey, and any other negative weather adjective. Saddening, really.

Oh, and I'm back on the concert circuit again! I'm going to two shows for sure over the next few months:

Of Montreal - March 9
Clap Your Hands Say Yeah - April 7 (yes, I know, I've heard mixed things about their live act, but I don't care, I want to go to more concerts again. And I love their album, so how bad can it be? It's not like the singer needs to possess any singing talent live to match the album)

Also, I might go to see Feist on January 24th, but I'm not sure yet. I saw her when she opened for Broken Social Scene, and she was definitely very good, but I'm not sure if I feel like driving all the way out to Ann Arbor and paying 12 bucks. And weather's definitely a big thing - I don't want to get caught up in some killer snow action.

Don't worry, I promise I won't update again for the entire weekend. Even if the Wes Anderson marathon is so awesome that I'm dying to post a livejournal entry about it, I will fight it. This is all the friends page space I'll take up for a while."

"event","As many of you know, the 12 credits I earned from last semester combined with my 17 AP transfer credits put me at 29 credits total, pushing me over the credit requirement for sophomore status. 

So today was my first day as a sophomore at CMU. Driving weather was beautiful, giving me the slightly over two-hour trip that I've yearned for over the past couple of months. Not only did I not spin out, but I didn't even have to worry about spinning out. The only real complications were the sun getting in my eyes (I went to put down the visor and didn't quite get it down all the way first try so I had to do it again - the whole thing was quite the ordeal) and guy going 35 in a 55 in the left lane(I know, right?!), but nothing I couldn't handle. I arrived with an air of confidence that can only be earned with 26 or more credit hours. After I ate a quality meal from Wendy's, made my bed, and organized my laundry, it became quite clear that it showed. On the way back from parking my car at the SAC, a guy in a SUV, clearly sensing my heightened level of intelligence, pulled along side me and asked where the freshman parking lot was. Drawing on a knowledge of CMU that can only be earned through carrying a map around for the first two weeks of school, I told him, ""right here."" He thanked me and went on his way.

Oh, freshmen. They are so young, but they grow up so fast.

Speaking of parking, I should be almost done with that stupid freshman lot. I need to contact the CMU police department to let them know of my increased status and get a sticker that shows it. It'll be nice to have a car on campus that's more of a car and less of a weekend get-away vehicle.

Classes begin tomorrow with my 11 AM Astronomy class, TAI 170H at, uh, some point, and Astronomy Lab at 8. I don't know where a single one of the classes are yet, but c'mon, I'm a sophomore! Like I need to plan in advance!

I'll update more on my hefty 16 credit hour class schedule later, but for now, I'd just like to leave you with one thing:

Actually, who am I kidding? 2006 has had TOO much to write about! That's the real reason I haven't updated in a week - no time! Let's just look at all the stuff I've done this year:

- got my picture taken with Mr. Tabar
- watched the start of season 5 of Scrubs
- hit up McDonald's breakfast right as they opened
- saw a new Arrested Development
- played a couple hands of poker
- maintained my hair for six days
- started replaying KOTOR, evil

Talk about a supercharged year! And if that's not enough, get a load of this. There's a good chance I've already excitedly IMed you about it, but just in case I haven't, there's no way I can rob you of this one. Last night, I read a rumor that Jon Stewart would be hosting this year's Oscars. It wasn't official yet, but in the proud Stewart tradition, I wasn't about to let petty things like 'facts' get in the way of my celebration. Well, tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I can confirm it.

http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/05/film.oscars.reut/index.html

Jon Stewart is hosting the Oscars. Just look at how official that URL looks. 

I've got high hopes, and this is coming from a guy who, historically, has never really given a shit about The Oscars. I feel that, finally, the quality of the hosting will offset the boredom of the speeches. This is monumental!

I hate to kill the good mood all of the sudden, but I've got no choice. There's very little chance I'll get around to updating this before I set off for school again (finishing KOTOR is my goal for the break), so I need to write my end-of-break paragraph now. So, this is it. I was looking forward to this break for about a month, and now it's nearly over. The next thing I've got to look forward to is the Of Montreal show in (God it's far away) March. 

But honestly? Even though break is almost over, and that by all means should put me into a spiral of cynicism, I gotta say: it went well. I saw plenty of people, did plenty of things, lost plenty of dollars toward McDonald's breakfast through poker (damn you, Nick). Don't get me wrong, I by no means want to go back to school. I definitely don't feel like going to class, eating lousy dorm food, and paying for my laundry again. I don't get it, am I supposed to be missing the college experience now or something? I know a bunch of people itching to get back to school after three weeks at home. Ah well, maybe I'll find something to do around Mt. Pleasant other than watching TV and hanging out at Meijer.

PS: I also still need to fight the honors program, which, while definitely being more work than I feel like doing, is something I feel I should do, if only to call out Dr. Hill on his douchebaggery. 

Well, that's all I'm doing for tonight. I was thinking about doing that survey that's floating around, but I'm too tired and lazy right now. I'm flattered that I was tagged twice, but seriously, I need my rest. I'm not made of survey answers."

"event","Because what kind of year-end entry <b>wouldn't</b> be? 

There are still three days left in 2005, technically, but it's only 1:30 and I'm used to a usual bedtime of around 4:30, so I've got roughly three hours to kill. I'm going to invest a chunk of these hours into a deep, introspective look at the past 362 days; what I did right, what I did wrong, what I simply, uh, <i>did.</i>

The rest of the time will probably be spent clicking things on facebook.

So I've no time to waste! Let's start off with, scienfically, the best way to self-examine a year.

<lj-cut text=""Livejournal Survey"">
1. What did you do in 2005 that you'd never done before?
Graduate high school, go to college, go to a music festival. 

2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?
I believe one of my New Years' resolutions last year was to go to more concerts. Well, I did that one. I think the other one was something along the lines of figuring out what I want to do with life; fucked that one up, but one for two isn't bad! As for this year, I'm going to go with grow out hair so glorious that, on first glance, people will think I'm Swedish.

3. Did anyone close to you give birth?
Nope.

4. Did anyone close to you die?
Mitch Hedberg, RIP.

5. What countries did you visit?
Uh... drove through Canada, yeah. That was it. And I kind of wish I didn't - Canadian drivers are the worst.

6. What would you like to have in 2006 that you lacked in 2005?
A better parking spot and, once again, the new Flaming Lips album.

7. What date from 2005 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?
July 16-17, 2005: The Intonation Festival. For more information, dig up the livejournal entry from last July and count the number of words.
Honorable Mention: Weekend of October 28th: Most ""pull shit together and see Broken Social Scene and Ben Folds back to back"" weekend to date.

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?
Definitely the weekend of October 28th. I wrote my final honors paper, drove to Detroit for Broken Social Scene, drove back to Mt. Pleasant for a 7 AM rescheduled French Revolution lecture, crashed for the afternoon, and drove to Kalamazoo for Ben Folds. I haven't felt so alive since I did 14 hours of US AP history in one day!

9. What was your biggest failure?
Definitely anything involving Prom. Not because I didn't go or anything - I still stand by it being impossible for me to find a date - but because of all the Walgreens, Rite-AIDs, and CVS's I went to that night, not a single one had a decent pair of sunglasses.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?
Actually, not really. I haven't been sick since school started. I don't really remember the rest of the year, but it couldn't have been that crippling.

11. What was the best thing you bought?
Intonation Fest tickets, hands down. The only thing even close is the ten dollars I chipped in toward the new showerhead in our dorm.

12. Whose behavior merited celebration?
Well, it's gotta go to either Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert. Their shows became a staple of my Monday to Thursday evening life at school. And as much as I think Jon's a great guy, as far as this year goes, it was pretty run-of-the-mill for him. Especially compared to last year, with the election, his appearance on Crossfire, and all that good stuff. But Stephen, he really shined. The Colbert Report extended the joy I felt during The Daily Show for another half an hour, and really, in a way, kept me going to become the successful 3.67 student I am today. The Colbert Report wasn't merely a lack-luster spin-off of The Daily Show. It was its own unique, brilliant entity. Which is why, Stephen, I have a word for you: Celebration. As in, merited. You. Congratulations.

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?
Anything and everything involving the CMU Honors Program. Well, actually, the other guys aren't bad; Dr. Hill's just a giant douche. The person I met for my Academic Planning thing was actually pretty helpful.

14. Where did most of your money go?
Uh, tuition and room and board? How is this even a contest?

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?
Serenity! Also, a number of the concerts I went to this year.

16. What song will always remind you of 2005?
Anything off the Clap Your Hands Say Yeah album. Hell, everytime I hear the second track on the album I think of incompetently setting up a tent in Port Huron.

17. Compared to this time last year, are you:
i. happier or sadder? Happier. Although, this isn't really much of a contest: I was total shit around this time last year.
ii. thinner or fatter? Skinnier. Lost seven pounds in college, guys! Thank you, I know my new, trim figure is looking good.
iii. richer or poorer? Poorer, definitely. Loans are a bitch.

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?
Watching the Daily Show and Colbert (I missed a couple of episodes, and even then, I didn't start religiously watching until late September/early October)

19. What do you wish you'd done less of?
Attending Honors 100 lectures.

20. How will you be spending Christmas?
Spent Christmas at home for the day, and then at AMC seeing King Kong for the night. And I can say that, because that movie really did take the entire night. Enjoyable, though.

22. Did you fall in love in 2005?
Nope.

23. How many one-night stands?
None. Although, there are plenty of open slots in 2006!

24. What was your favorite TV program?
Probably, on the whole, Arrested Development. The Daily Show and Colbert are great, but Arrested Development is just sheer, pure genius. Scrubs also gets an honorable mention because, hey, I can't believe I possibly overlooked it for this long.

25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?
Dr. Hill

26. What was the best book you read?
Not too sure. I like what I've seen of Naked Pictures of Famous People.

27. What was your greatest musical discovery?
Oh God, jeez, I really don't know. I found about a ton of great stuff this year, got more into stuff that I dismissed as merely 'good' last year, and probably downloaded around 20 additional gigs of music. So it's a really, really tough call for me. But I'm going to go with The Wrens. I found about them last January when Chris gave me The Meadowlands to burn, and it's been one of the most consistantly catchy albums I've ever heard. And Seacaucus and the Abbot 1135 EP are great too. Silver's kind of rougher, but hey, it was really early, it's okay.

28. What did you want and get?
Lots of concerts. Serenity.

29. What did you want and not get?
Free tuition and room and board. Thanks a lot, Centralis.

30. What was your favorite film of this year?
Serenity!

31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?
18. Best birthday ever! Went to Ann Arbor to pick up Nate and Dan, bought a lotto ticket (didn't win millions, in case you were wondering), and went to see Dungen in Detroit. Also, caught up with Gustav before the show. He thought it was cool that my friends were going to buy me one of their t-shirts for my birthday! Of course, they sold out of t-shirts, which was totally not cool, but I'm sure he won't hold that against me next time we hang out.

32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?
Dungen t-shirt.

33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2005?
Metro slob.

34. What kept you sane?
Daily Show + Colbert Report block.

35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?
So wait, is this physical or mental? I've never figured this out, and I've been doing this survey for three years now. So I'm going to take a bold step: I'm boycotting this question until the creator of this survey comes out of the woodwork and gives a concrete answer.

36. What political issue stirred you the most?
Let's see. Hmm. I guess the entire ""Happy Holidays"" vs. ""Merry Christmas"" thing stirred me, just because it was so, so, so, so ridiculous.

37. Who did you miss?
Nate, Dan, Nick, Kyle, free laundry, and whoever else I left when I went to college.

38. Who was the best new person you met?
Jeez, this was an insane year for new people. It was college! I was meeting new people daily for about a month! I'm supposed to pick just one? Wow, I don't know... actually, who am I kidding, it's Gustav Ejstes from Dungen.

39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2005.
I have cooler dreams than anybody I know.

40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.

""CLAP YOUR HANDS!
But I feel so lonely
CLAP YOUR HANDS!
But it won't do nothing
CLAP YOUR HANDS!
But I have no money
CLAP YOUR HANDS!
But it don't seem like me
CLAP YOUR HANDS!
Are you up to something?
CLAP YOUR HANDS!
Where's my milk and honey?
CLAP YOUR HANDS!
But I just look funny
CLAP YOUR HANDS!
I'll just wait awhile""

Clap Your Hands Say Yeah - Clap Your Hands! (goofiest song on the album, but, surprisingly, the one with closest to intelligible lyrics)
</lj-cut>

So that was 2005. It wasn't too shabby. For such a landmark year (graduation, college), I'll take it. I don't know what my true talent is, I feel like I've done very little ""finding myself""; really, I feel the only part of me that's grown in college has been my hair. But it's alright, this year was able to get by on significant events alone.

2006, though... 2006 has nothing. No graduations, no nothing. I don't know how I'll handle it. I was just able to coast along last year and have it be lifechanging; this one, I might have to actually do something. 

I'm not looking forward to you, 2006."

"event","But first, quick question for Catholics: I turned on the TV before I went to bed and the Pope was on giving mass. Anyway, I changed the channel to some stupid adult swim show. Am I going to hell for this? For sure?

Now that I've confessed to the eternal damnation of my soul, I'd like to say a couple things about Christmas.

The phrase ""Merry Christmas"". You're read about it plenty; it's, undeniably, quickly become the most ridiculously overplayed news story of the year. To write on it would simply be trite. But now that Christmas has come and gone and ""Happy Holidays"" has dominated chain stores all over, I'd just like to say one thing to the PC experts who nailed us on ""Merry Christmas"".... how did you guys crack the code? How did you figure out that underneath our brotherly seasonal greeting was a deep-seeded burning hatred for all other religions? 

This equality of holidays stuff is killing me. Tell you what, I'm just going to drop all the smoke and mirrors. From this day forth, my preferred seasonal greeting will be ""Terrible Hanukkah"". Happy now?

But I digress. Here's the list of stuff I got for Christmas:

- Serenity, the gift everybody should have
- Daily Show: Indecision 2004 DVD set
- Sixty bucks
- A Frank Zappa CD from my brother (actually, interestingly enough, I haven't ever gotten around to listening to anything by him, so this works out pretty well)

Kind of a light load at first glance. But keep in mind that I got my main gift - a cell phone with a year of service - a week earlier. And I've spent far more than I should have on clothes, all of which my dad covered. The Daily Show DVDs will also be an especially useful gift, as they'll help me get through the drought that is Holiday Break for The Daily Show and The Colbert Report. Yes, I know, the DVDs only have The Daily Show, but the way I see it, there are a few bonus Colbert interviews, a bonus Colbert short, and a couple of other things that, if played in the correct order, could almost seem like a full episode of the Report. I'm going to save it for a special occasion.

Also, I got 100 bucks from my grandma, 80 bucks from my aunt and uncle, and 50 bucks from my mom. So that brings up my money total to... (getting the bold ready)... <b>$290.</b> 

So, on the whole, not too bad! And I'm seeing King Kong tonight, which will give me a good dose of friend action in a day that's been full of sitting online and awkward family talks, so that'll be nice. I'd rate this Christmas slightly less merry than a TBS Christmas Story marathon, but still fairly merry.

Terrible Hanukkah, everybody."

"event","I guess I'll run this one top to bottom.

My film class was total bull. I would have had an A if I got a couple more points on the final; points that I lost on my plot summary. I received no credit for my plot summary because it was too detailed and I read it straight off a sheet of paper instead of copying it to a notecard. Fortunately, I nailed the actual analysis. It's disheartening to think that I would have had an A if I just said, ""it's about a bunch of Jews in some Russian village"".

Damn you, American Sign Language. I had a solid A in the class, but I got an A- on the paper, a B+ on the second exam, and apparently something around a B on the dialogue. Well, hey, that's fair. We did have the sign for basketball wrong throughout the entire thing, and considering that the last minute was entirely based around basketball, I think it's a fair punishment.

Holy crap, I can't believe I somehow got a solid A in my French Revolution class. I don't know how it happened. But, hey. I think this is celebration worthy. So, woo!

I was pulling the most consistant A- in my speech class I've ever seen. I think I literally got an A- on every single thing I did in that class. So no surprise here.

Aaaaaaaaaand Honors. I've had plenty of people ask me to let them know how it turns out, so here it is: They failed me. A big ""NC"". This really shouldn't come as a surprise, though. The honors program at Central is heavily intoxicated on its own bullshit ideals, and my paper didn't tell them exactly what they wanted to hear, so this is a reasonable outcome. I'm not sure if this means I'm out of the honors program or not. And I'm not sure if I feel like fighting the grade or not. By definition, I did what the paper asked; I told the honors program to shove it along the way, but I completed the assignment. And, as somebody who's working on his U of M transfer app, a NC probably doesn't look very good. But, God, I don't feel like talking to Dr. Hill. That man is such a giant douchebag, and every time I have to listen to him talk, I feel like a piece of me dies. And after HON 100, I don't have very many pieces to spare.

So, to recap:

Lit. Dimensions of Film - A-
American Sign Langage: Honors - B+ 
French Revolution - A
Voice and Diction - A-
Intro to Honors - NC

Credit Hours Passed: 12

Overall GPA: 3.67

As a deadbeat in his first semester of college, I'll take it."

"event","Look outside. See sunlight? Odds are you don't! Today is the Winter Solstice - scientifically the shortest day of the year. The sun rises at 7:59 this morning and sets at 5:02 this evening. That's only <b>nine hours and three minutes</b> of sunlight.

As a proud member of the pale population, allow me to say that this is, without a doubt, our biggest holiday.

I don't feel the Solstice gets the appreciation it deserves. I was actually looking at my calendar a couple days ago, and the Solstice isn't listed anywhere on the entire thing. Christmas is on there, Hanukkah made the cut ; hell, even Kwanzaa weaseled its way onto there! What kind of world do we live in where the Winter Solstice takes a backseat to Kwanzaa?

That's why I'm making this entry. If the City of Troy won't give the Winter Solstice proper recognition on their stupid free calendar, then I'm its only defense. Need I remind you that the Solstice is the shortest day of the year; this also means that it's the <b>longest night</b> of the year. From a scientific standpoint, the Winter Solstice should have the most partying of any day on the calendar. If only people would embrace this golden day, we could easily out-do New Years'. After all, what is New Years' but a Solstice robbed of several minutes of nightlife?

So I ask of you, enjoy your Winter Solstice, but please, be responsible."

"event","Today's car ride was only three and a half hours as opposed to four, but it contained significantly more high fives than the trip for Thanksgiving.

Also, it was infinitely more tiring. Thanksgiving's drive was brutal at the beginning but it let up a lot. Today was just a bitch all the way through. It got a little better once I went a ways down I-75, but it was still irritating enough to maintain 'bitch' status.

But the highlight of the trip came on M-20, which is the first significant highway on this route to Troy from Mt. Pleasant. About half an hour in the road went from being slushy on the sides to being slush with faint tire tracks. While it was managable, I had to take it easy. Very easy. I'm talking 30 to 35 miles an hour in a 55 zone, which put me around the flow of traffic, give or take a couple very slow or very fast cars.

This was, evidently, not nearly slow enough.

My speed-demon 30 miles an hour was too much for my car to handle. The slush got the better of it and it began to slide.

Except I have a Neon, so when it slides, it fuckin' slides. My car did nearly two complete circles on the road. Fortunately, I kept it between my lane and the left turn lane, and there happened to be no people in either of those lanes, so a near death experience became an awesome experience.

And how could there possibly be another response to doing two circles on a highway with absolutely no consequences? A high five was necessary.

The rest of the trip was alright, though. Semis are bastards. For a large chunk of I-75 I averaged about 40 to 45, which isn't too bad considering how terrible the visibility was and how shitty the roads were, but semis were passing me at about ten miles faster than I was going. This is not only dangerous, but also irritating; semis throw a TON of shit on your windshield.

The lanes were a lot of fun. The snow made it nearly impossible to see the lane markers, so everybody just kind of drove on their best guess. It was a lot of fun when I didn't really have anybody to follow and a lane mark would become visible through the snow, letting me know that I was right in the middle of two lanes. I said ""oh, dammit"" a good number of times.

So I guess what I'm saying is that all of you high school kids who maybe got stuck in a ditch or slid just a little on your way home from school today... you guys got nothin'. I've got 720 degrees of intensity on you guys."

The night before I left for school, I was up late listening to music and writing a livejournal entry. And now, the night before I leave school, I'm... up late listening to music and writing a livejournal entry.

I've come so far.

That said, hey, I've pulled shit together. I finished my French Revolution essay, which I've already sent to Nate for proofreading. I'd send it to more people, but it's kind of... how do I say this.... bad. I've typically felt at least decent about every essay I've done this year (sans the ones for intro to honors which sucked me of my soul), but this one, ugh. 35% of my grade is riding on some essay where I wasn't even sure what I was talking about. I've got some really classy sources, though; one of my books is really old and has gold-rimmed pages. I should make sure to point that out.

And this sign language dialogue is <b>down.</b> I get to play the role of a deadbeat dad, married with three kids in an apartment. But cut me some slack, my first-born boy is deaf. It's not easy raising a deaf kid... but you wouldn't know that. You'd rather judge me!

"event","Alright, I really shouldn't update on an empty stomach, but I'm holding off until dinner and I've got nothing better to do. So if my sentences aren't perfectly structured, or if I slip into elaborate prose about how much I enjoy Pop Tarts, please forgive me.

Last night was cool, but last day... not so much.

I had to make the mighty car pilgrimage to the SAC to get my car to take Fiddler on the Roof back to Family Video. And it became much colder, windier, and snowier than I was expecting. But it was nothing that I couldn't handle - when a late fee is on the line, I can take anything. But here's the thing: It wasn't the cold, wind, or snow that really got to me; it was this one guy in the parking lot.

I was scraping the snow off my car like usual, doing everything I can to keep my hands from going completely numb, and this guy came driving up behind me. And it wasn't like he just drove by; he <i>slowed</i>. He slowed to a crawl. And he and the two other people in his car were looking at me with goofy grins on their faces.

I just can not figure out what I did to get that reaction. I was scraping off my car, nothing more. I still had my iPod on and I was using my headphones as earmuffs, is that funny? What about stopping every few seconds to try to get some feeling back in my hands because I don't own gloves, is that hilarious? I just don't get it, and it's eating me up inside. 

Anyway, I can't let that guy get the best of me. I managed to move on through the day, I can manage to move on through this entry. A few hours, one movie return, and a dinner later...

Friiiiiiiiiiiiiiday night! This is the first Friday night I've spent at Central in ages. I don't think I've spent a whole weekend up here since Jim Gaffigan late last September. I've been too busy hanging out with best-buddy Gustav, eleven or so members of Broken Social Scene, the five members of Wolf Parade hammered out of their minds, and all other kinds of happening folk; it's about time I've taken a little time to experience the party town of Mt. Pleasant.

Around 8:30 or so I decided to head out to Cory's room to see if there was something we could do, but he was thoroughly engaged in the TV Edit of Scream 2. I had nothing better to do, so I decided to join in, piecing the ridiculous plot together as I went. There was some great TV Edit moments, but it was still no Pulp Fiction. Regardless, ""Freaker"" stands as one of the best TV curses of all time.

The movie ended and Cory and myself decided to head out to the Muncherie to blow some flex bucks on nasty greasy crap, but what did we smell in the hallway? Certainly not nasty greasy crap. I couldn't tell if it was brownies, cake, or <b>maybe even both</b>, but we decided to carry on to the Muncherie anyway. We got our food (mozerella sticks and cheese bread; a very hearty serving of greasy dairy), and all of the sudden two girls popped in the room and invited us to have cake and brownies.

I don't think I stopped giving a double thumbs-up throughout the entire conversation.

So we wound up in their room, eating their brownies and cake, sitting in their chairs. They had a few other people over, but I feel I gave back the most, leaving them with a ten cent deposit on a can of Mountain Dew I was drinking. We wound up watching Saw, which I had never seen. Honestly, it wasn't really that bad. I wouldn't say it's as great as Brooke or Jaime or whoever was ranting about it end of last year was making it out to be, but it was a decently entertaining B horror-film. Se7en beats the pants off it in every regard; the director of Saw is undoubtedly guilty of envy toward the director of Se7en.

Also, as it turns out, one of the girls I met was very into the same music as me; and as we know, around Central, that's a very hard statement to make if you don't love country. We wound up talking about concerts, and I told her about seeing Broken Social Scene fourth row and Arcade Fire front row, and she wound up calling one of her friends at 1:30 in the morning to tell her. After having met a dozen ""what's it?""s, ""who""s, and ""fuckin' swedish, for real?""s around campus when I've talked about going to concerts, seeing a reaction that has any sort of excitement, let alone THAT much excitement, is fantastic. She met a very prompt facebook friends addition, bringing the total number of people at Central who like the same music as me to about, say, six.

And if all that wasn't enough, I met my favorite drunk people on the way back to my hall. Drunk people can be annoying at times, but not these guys. These guys are the real deal. And they were eating snow and slipping all over the ice, so it was a good time. 

PS: Man, I really enjoy Pop-Tarts."

"event","So this is it. A semester of hard work is finally coming to a close. Come a week from Thursday, I'll be done with my first semester of college. In fact, thanks to AP credits, I'll be an experienced sophomore. They say you change the most your freshman year of college... so what do I have to say about my freshman experience at college? How has it changed me?

That, my friends, is for next Thursday's update. It's too early to judge now - I still have a week and a half of refining my personal character to do. Finals could very well make me a different man. Although, to be honest, I've got a very easy final line-up. I only have one actual final. The others are papers, presentations, or sign language dialogues. 

But here are some things I can tell you about:

If you recall late last August (and if you don't, you're not spending nearly as many hours on my journal as you should), I talked about getting the mole on my forehead removed. Well, last Friday, I went with it. There's currently a red mark that looks pretty much exactly like a mole, but in about two weeks, I will have one of the cleanest foreheads around. And just think of all the ways I can part my hair and have it look slightly less goofy!

And speaking of hair, my hair is well on its way to becoming a mane. The hours a day I spend tending to it will soon pay off.

I got a new winter jacket, finally. I've been wearing that cheap lightweight jacket for too long. While it started out strong with a random compliment from some girl a couple of rooms over, it was time to move onto something warmer. And it's actually interesting how it played out: I've never been a big fan of the Gap. In fact, I've probably made a couple of 'pffts' anytime after anybody said ""the gap"". But I went in there for the first time with Kyle and Leah when we went mallratting on Saturday, and honestly.... it's not that bad. Their shirts, pants, and nearly everything but jackets cost way more than anybody should ever spend, but they had a really wicked long wool coat for 90 bucks. And I've been in the market for a winter coat for about three months now, so I went for it. 

First time in the Gap, and I blew ninety bucks. You win, overpriced clothing chains of America.

But, as part of their promotion, they also gave me a fifteen dollar gift card because my purchase was so expensive. Which is devious, because there's nothing in that store that costs less than 25 bucks, but I'd feel bad if I didn't spend that 15 on something, so they just sucked at least another 10 bucks out of me. I was going to use it on a scarf, but I managed to find one in the closet, so now I have, you could say, a 15 dollar shopping spree! So how should I spend it?! I could use a pair of gloves. Or a hat. Or... what else do they have in that store? How should I blow that 15 bucks? You decide, readers!

Also, they dragged me into American Eagle for the first time ever, and while I still stand by everything in that store costing too much, they were playing ""Christmas at the Zoo"" by the Flaming Lips on their radio, which was a nice break from the same Christmas songs I've been hearing in every mall since early November. So they've earned a couple of points on the Brian scale. Not nearly points to justify a purchase; if the Brian scale was, say, a real scale, they'd weigh in at the same weight I was after my surgery.

I saved the best for last. Clear out the number one slot on your speed dial, because....

I'm getting a cell phone!

.... Maybe!

My dad's work offers a pretty cheap family plan, so he said he'd get me a cell phone and pay for a year of service for Christmas this year. This would be handy, as, you know, sometimes I'd like not to be distanced from all of the outside world. But here's the catch: It's Cingular, and I'm not sure if it'll get service in Mt. Pleasant. So if you have Cingular, let me know how it works around here so I can get back to my dad on whether to get it or not.

Or, if you know anything cell phones at all, is Cingular a good one? 

If you could stop scrolling for a second and answer this question, it would be greatly appreciated.

"event","Today's been pretty good.

But I can't delve into that quite yet. I've got over an entire week of material to cover. I've left you guys hanging since last Wednesday, omitting ALL of Thanksgiving break, and for that I apologize. I'm sure you've been refreshing your friends' page hourly since this weekend.

So let's start with the break. Thanksgiving break. The first break from school since Labor Day back in September, giving me a good.... few days of rest. But did I ever had to work for those few days of rest! The drive back home was a laborous, dangerous journey through snow, rain, traffic, and even the occasional fog. It normally takes me just over two hours to get from Mt. Pleasant to Troy - this trip took four and a half hours, with a total car count of 26 ditched cars, including at least one semi. The trip was so intense that I earned a congratulatory handshake from Cory's dad accompanied by a positive exclamation of ""dude"", the highest honor I could ever possibly hope for.

Then the break kicked off in style with some shindig at Ellen's, where I goofed around with a lot of people I haven't goofed around with in a couple months. 

The rest of the break... let's see, rest of the break. There's a lot to cover here. Let's just say that I saw some movies, ate some food, and stood outside Comp USA at midnight for no reason. I'll let you guys work out the rest.

And that's all the material on my break you're going to get. If you want to know more, well, don't come crying to me - this stuff is going off the record. Not every bit of my life can be made public. I need to cut some parts to maintain my image as a man of mystery.

Back to school! Honestly, I wasn't really looking forward to it at all, but it's turned out to be pretty okay. I was dreading everything up until today at 3:30. I had a vocal study to do, a book review to write, and a book to read for my film class. Here is how everyting, astoundingly, fell entirely in my favor:

- The book for my film class was two hundred pages, which, while not long by any means, was still more than what I wanted to read. But then I read in small font right underneath the title three words that lit up my entire night: ""and other stories"". The story I had to read was only a hundred pages, and although it wasn't really interesting, it was an easy hundred pages.
- My teacher for my film class lost her voice, making her unable to lead the class discussion. This made what is usually a three or so hour class a half hour.
- Allowing me to get an early start on my vocal study, which turned out pretty okay. There's still probably a decent amount of stuff I messed up, but hey, it'll do. The presentation didn't even go all that terribly, which was shocking.
- The book review for my French Revolution class could be on one of the books I already read, and it only had to be 2 to 3 pages. So I did that after my speech class.

And, to top it all off, I pulled a solid A on my last French Revolution paper. None of that B business this time, and A-'s are for the weak - this was a solid, legitimate, man's A.

To celebrate, I went out to Target and finally got my hands on the new Darkness album. I'd been listening to it since last Wednesday (only a couple hours after that past update, in fact!) courtesy of <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thedarkness"">their myspace</a> audio player. I really dig it. It's been getting some kind of mixed reviews - 6.5 out of 10, three stars out of five, A- out of A+... but what do all these ratings mean? When will there be a system we can truly relate to? Somebody needs to step up to the plate and help the people understand.

And, well, you know me, I like to help the people.

I'd rate the new Darkness, <i>One Way Ticket to Hell... And Back!</i>, a my hair late summer 2004 out of a possible Gustav mane. Let's face it, this album knows how to rock. It's got some killer points, and there are times when it shines and bounces with the best of them. But it's almost <i>too</i> layered, becoming a knotted mess at points. 

Well, that's it. A week without updating and I've probably given you more than you want to read over two weeks. If you've made it all the way to the bottom of the entry, and you're still going, I feel I need to give something back. So I'd just like to say a few words. If you're reading this entry on...

December 1st: Hey, way to be, man! That's devotion! This entry's been up for one day, and you've covered the whole thing! This is what I like to see!
December 2nd: Alright, we can't be perfect <i>all</i> the time. So you slipped up just this once. You can make up for it next time. If you can nail a good comment it'll make up for lost time.
December 3rd: Two days? Wait a second, you weren't putting off this entry until the weekend, were you? I just can't believe you sometimes.
December 4th or later: God, are you ignoring me? Why won't you return my calls? I've left you, like, ten messages. You know what, fine. Just forget it. I don't even want to talk to you anymore."

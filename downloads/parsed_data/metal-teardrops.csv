"event","i got in a bad mood today for no reason. it wasn't nice. and usually i don't get in mad moods while i'm around friends and stuff... but i guess it was just the fact that i get bothered about what they think about me... about how i'm too ""clingy"" and ""annoying"" and whatnot. but i got over it. but i'm still thinking my meds aren't working too great lately... it is possible that they don't work for me anymore, because after you've been on them for awhile that can happen... and it's been 4 years on the meds. well i'm going to the therapist tomorrow i'll talk to her about that i suppose. and i'm getting very fond of my baby once again... but i'm not ready to make any committments because i'm scared of what might happen. i have to give it a week or two of things being wonderful with him, then i'll take it into consideration. but right now i think i'm in a fine mood, and the present is all that matters. no worrying about the past. and if you worry about the future then that's all you'll amount to... worrying."

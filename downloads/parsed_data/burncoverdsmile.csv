"event","Well i started ironworking almost a year ago now it was october to be exact and so of these ten months i have probably been able to stay at my home for 2 its complete bull shit. i get to go home on the weekends lately because this job is in wisconsin. Going home means getting on a boat at 6:30 wisconsin time and docking at 10:30 michigan time its a 2 and a half hour boat ride thats if its on time which it never is and if the water is bad its a way longer ride last weekend the boat showed up an  hour late one of the engines broak down and the water sucked it didnt dock till 12 midnight. then i have a 2 and a half hour drive to ann arbor so i get home at 1 if everything goes perfect then i have from then till sunday at 1 last weekend with that boat crap i wasnt even home 24 hrs its bull shit.and not to mention regina works every saterday so i dont even get to see her half the time because shes working. im trying to get some work around home ive put my name on the list of every hall close to home i would be estatic for a job that all i have to do is drive two hrs to work that would be amazing to me. michigans economy is so bad right now i hate it. ive decided that if i should be so lucky and get something close to home im gonna go back to school im pretty sure i want to do firefighting school and some emt shit so that i can be home everyday with my babygirl and sleep next to her i miss being next to her all the time its terrible.

all i know is this life isnt for me. it makes me hate everything. im so sorry regina i know you hate it as much if not more then me. arent you glad you married me? 

i feel like there is more but my mind is blank and dull feeling im gonna go to sleep.
your one day a week husband
levi

something to add up there in all that. the job pays good and i love what i do but not good enough and i dont love it enough to feel like this all the time"

"event","ssoooooo lets see next saterday is the biggest day of my life. im not really sure what words can describe these feelings. its been pretty stressfull but exciting at the same time and i havnt even done half of the stuff that gina has done for the wedding so if anybody that happens to read this is going you should give her all the credit for this thing when you talk to her. lots of friends lots of family good food all that jazz so it should be a blast im so excited but its like i cant wait for it to be done also. the honeymoon is gonna be so fun cant wait till vegas heck yeah we are staying in the hooters hotel and casino we hear its the nicest one. i dont know just being married to gina finally is gonna be sweet. i dont know i feel like i should just write and write about how amazing it is but i just cant think of any words for it all i can come up with is just i love her i couldnt live with out her this is the most amazing thing that is ever gonna happen to me and thats all that really needs to be said 
protect her
love her
provide for her
faithfull to her
be true to her"

"event","well i came home early from work this week thought that i was gonna have the rest of the week off i was excited to spend so much time with regina seeing as how we are NEVER together anymore. We had a date planned for tonight when she gets out of work i was very excited for that. She just left for work i am always amazed at how beautiful of person i am with. i love watching her get ready to go. i dont know this traveling thing for work is started to get old i miss alot of things we used to be able to do, i miss her working at the lamp post because i could go sit up there with her. i miss the bell's pizza and humas ohhh and big ten burrito i usually had to beg her for that because we ate it so much. i dont know there is alot of things that we dont get to do anymore. but im getting off track my dad called and said i have to leave again tonight(for those who dont know i work for my father) buttttt im not working that far  away and gina has quite a few days off in a row and i think shes gonna come see me which will be good cuz i want us to spend time with my family. im gonna shower and get ready then bring her some dinner before i go so i should get off of here and get ready

"event","i keep thinking of more to talk about ive been traveling alot for work like far travel NC and wisconsin and stuff. it sucks being away from regina and home so much but trying to make money for things we need its feels so good to come home and see her. this might be creepy and i dont think she realizes it but when i get home and we get in bed i usually just lay there with my hand on her stomach and feel how soft she is, its amazing how good something so simple can be at the end of the week when ive been gone. its prolly my new favorite thing to do. and i try and enjoy every second we have together when im home even the not so pleasent ones :)"

i had sugery at the begining of this month for a hernia it wasnt all that bad gina had to take care of me :)
ummm it kinda tapped us outa money though and that sucks because i was out of work for  the whole month

gonna buy a house instead of renting and wasteing all of our money on that. and i cant wait for that because the 
places we looked at are frickin sweet. and i't will be a place of our own.

regina, kyle, and I went to michigans adventures on sunday i had a blast and i think the both of them did also
we visited my parents it was the same old thing as always ummmm i dont really have a whole lot to say to be honest

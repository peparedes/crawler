"event","<big> I HAD TO DO THE SCARIEST THING</big>

you know the whole quote we all love ...<i>""dance as if no one's watching""</i>? and you just go crazy and random and dance (pretty badly) and feel awesome, but are definitely glad no one saw it because you're not a dancer?

WELL
have I got a story.
well, not really...but anyway.

I was performing Not For The Life Of Me today in MVP class, and my task from the previous time I had done it was was to ""be playful, dance, have fun"" kind of thing. So I worked on that, it faired out well. But since we were at the end of the day, Marie (The head), says ""Ok...just...FOR FUN....You're going to do this again, and move, shake, dance THE ENTIRE song. The only mistake you can make is not moving."" Oh, keep in mind everyone, that this is in front of my MVP class, half of which whom are dancers, all of which are my peers, and hey - we all know that's the toughest crowd.

[Crapping my pants,]I kind of just threw myself into it, ended up doing something along the lines of ""Walk Like An Egyptian"" at some point (Hey! I had an impulse!)...it got laughs, and everyone enjoyed how foreign/nervous/scary/exciting of a territory I put myself into.
But man - talk about SCARY. I knew there was no way out of it.

And what kind of comments did I get from the Prof?

""YOU. HAVE. <b>INFECTIOUS. ENERGY</b>"" (I was quite pleased at this one) &
""I would cast you as Millie in a heartbeat.""

Anyway.
This was yesterday.
It started out lousy, ended up satisfying.
And now I'm done with that song and get to work on a new one!

I suggest taking a listen to <i>Solo Saxophone</i> from Miss Saign...I think Chris Waldron and I may do this one (Very VERY nice duet).




I'm off!

"event","Ontario - water - stinks. Not literally, but it doesn't taste very pleasant. Even filtered with the always-amazing Brita system, it makes my tea taste like licking a tin can.BLECH. For the record, i   Don't   Like   the   Taste   of   metal.


Week 2 is almost complete.  I'm still working on getting an exemption from our long Thursday morning lecture & seminar...Yeah, it's now Thursday and I stil haven't printed out a transcript from DAL, so yeah, I still have to go today. It makes for a really long and (don't hurt me) BORING morning. Who said you needed to like everything about the theatre. This is an ""exploring theatre's history"" class. I'm not a history buff, whether the context is interesting or not!
That aside,the afternoon should perk things up. Our dance performance teacher on Thursdays is really helpful because she teaches us routines that we can all do and work together. It's not an obvious hierarchy of who' better than the other. (For the record, our Nazi teacher on Tuesdays does this...She means well, and gives us a killer workout, but she makes me feel less competant.) 
Our MVP class is going well too - I just sang last week and am working on going up a second time while there are people who haven't performed a first time so I most likely won't perform my piece (<i>Not For The Life of Me - Thoroughly Modern Millie</i>) until next Tuesday or Thursday.


I've gott run.Commuting can eat it!

I'll try to upload some music clips I've recorded in random classes for you to enjoy (or dismiss).



Until then!

- Tricia

"event","My first post in this fresh new face is a post to explain why I chose <i><b>learningtoplay</b></i> as my journal title. A title is a very important and specfifc choice, afterall.

1) I had originally enveloped the idea of ""Timetoplay"" as my journal name, but someone else was as clever as I and it was taken. Moving on.

2) ..Hence the construction of ""Learningtoplay"". It's growing on me. In fact, I think I like it better. 

<i>Learningtoplay</i> is in fact, a large component of what I'm facing even in my first week of school at Sheridan. In order to 'play' you need to bring yourself to that child-like substance. Carefree, little to no inhibitions, unaware that anyone is watching. As an actor/singer/dancer combination you need to be utterly <b>fearless</b>. The word itself brings a great amount of its counterpart to the surface. I'm terrified. But the thing is - so is everyone else. We're all going to be stripped down (not literally...YET) to our bare bones. By the end of the program - we're going to emerge as completely new beings. New beings with the essence of who we were and what we brought with us as the foundation...and everything else we will learn and experience to complete who we are going to be.


So here I am - learning.to.play!

So far it has been scary, exciting, emotional, tense, stressful, joyful, happy, etc.
I get home at 8 pm nightly, exhausted. Hating life sometimes. 
but I get up the next day and do it all over again.

Why? Because I absolutely couldn't be doing anything else.

Until next time!"

"event","G'MORNING!

I just discovered [for those of you who are aware of it] something better than <i>Pandora</i> music genome project.

Ok, no I didn't exactly discover it. It was a site recommended to my class in my computer skills class. Get this - we're allowed to play tunes in that class!

Anyway,for those of you who are music fiends [David, Kevin, Audrey, anyone?] It is called
<a href=""http://www.accuradio.com"">AccuRadio</a> and has radio stations of every genre, INCLUDING Broadway! This is where I have been discovering all my tunes lately.

For example, I am currently listening to ""All good gifts"" from <b>Godspell</b>.

I thought you'd like this tidbit of information if you're hurting for some much needed musical love in your life.

Bon appetit!"

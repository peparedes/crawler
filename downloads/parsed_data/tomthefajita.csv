"event","i was involved in my first accident today.


i was drving.                   jj was shotgun







alex was talking          nathan was laughing.

we were riding from mercy to some tux place on grand river. i had just made the almighty michigan left onto the SE route of grand river as we were passing through the grand river and inkster intersection. incubus was playing, after jj had switched the cd player from ziggy marley. i believe the song was 'acrowleftofthemurder'. we drove through the first half of the intersection in the right hand lane when i noticed a truck was inched too far into the intersection. i naturally scooted  a bit to the left to avoid a collision - which would have werked, had the cracker not screwed it up. the guy, who was no older than 18, (and a fresh grounding of white trash) didn't realize that he had a red light and there was a surge of traffic flowing his way. he was preparing to turn onto grand river but he didn't look, so he drove straight into sable's right posterior, royally screwing the respectful door, ripping off the gas cap, and shattering the window all over alex, but mostly nathan, who wasn't harmed. quite amazing that no one was harmed. i'm glad. we kind of just laughed about it when we were in the taco bell parking lot, filling out police forms and whatnot. 
the WT's truck, who's butt (rear bumper) was capped all over with stickers such as: i eat my roadkill! take that PETA! ....weirdo........ anyways.....the WT's truck didn't get ANY damage except for maybe one damaged light or something. i'm glad nothing bad happened to him though. it was a mistake. they happen, and we learn from them.
what's really cool is that i wasn't to blame. everyone was safe. the damage was bad, but not half as bad as it could be. the sun was out. it was warm. i cgot to hang with my pals until everything go worked out.
what sucks is that the WT didn't have his license so he got extra ticket fees for that. 
kind of funny, a crow left of the murder is playing on winamp right now.
i'm going to remeber that song forever.
what flashed through my mind at the time of the collision?
the uze. plain thoughts of what's always on my mind. no pencil shavings though. i'm sure some of you could figure it out.

everything i wanted to know.
everything i wanted to see.

boom.

skool was phun. got my dirty whiskey shirt today. practice was......ok besides the accident.
first time for everything though.

but i've been sick too many times, and i'm starting up again. blah.
oh well.
it's warm out. got too many good things to look forward to.

<font size=""-2""><font size=""-2""><font size=""-2""><font size=""-2""><font size=""-2""><font size=""-2"">I ask you to picture our world, all the little nations and groups of people, and view their governing philosophies. Consider the sub-communities of our education system. Finally, look inside yourself; search deep inside your mind. Valid in all of these examples are vicissitudes of power and authority; permutations of two ideas quite different yet commonly used interchangeably. Power: the external strength one confides in when he finds nothing inside himself; a strength that dominates a person through ideas of failure and emptiness. Authority: a strength that centers itself internally through a person's knowledge that all he can do is grow stronger; it relates with a strong self-esteem and yearning for life. Power and authority hold great differences in the ideas of competition, law, and even one's own creativity - one's unique way of thought and views of the world. These confusions can lead to far greater misuse of what God has blessed man with: reason.
Evident in a basketball game between two state finalists or between the leading donkey and his opposing elephant, competition provides the world with a reason to become better than its present self; it can dominate an athletes mind to make poor choices or capture a politician's campaign of honesty for the people into a campaign of lies and faulty tax returns. But these instances are much the same reversed in some cases. Competition does not always cause negativity for a person. Competition, when affected by power, though, can cause one to rely on tools such as lying, cheating, or, depending on the instance, using harmful techniques to rise above the opposition. When used with authority, however, competition causes us to strive for one's best and to challenge one another positively to become greater than they are. These opposite actions are quite similar to those of the ideals of law.
Constantly taken advantage of, law has always been the geek in the class. People find ways of manipulating law for their own doing, causing great distress for entire nations. Politicians pushed by power tend to use law as a ride to their domination. They use law to control that which should be run independently. Kings and queens of the past and, the more contemporary, Saddam Hussein, have used law to take over nations. But, just like any other dorkus in the class, law has proven to help nations immensely. In the hands of one who is pushed by authority, law has given the world great advances in peace and culture, positively contributing to the advancement of communities, influencing another key element to power and authority: creativity.
Creativity is an individualistic thing. Every person has their own unique mind and creative style to things. Yet, when we view creativity controlled by power, it is put forth as a quality that must have no mistakes. Everything we think, individually, must be perfect. As a human, one definitely understands that he is not perfect, but when he is dominated by the external strength of power, he is blinded. Contrariwise, creativity is a beautiful thing when run through authority. When one knows that mistakes may be made, he knows he can learn from them, which helps him to create new things from his self.
Essentially, power can be viewed as the negative and authority as the positive end of the spectrum. Power causes one to view his life poorly and look down on one's self, whereas authority can cause one to understand his self and that he has much to learn from life. Authority brings about a sense of hope and is used as a tool to help one excel in life. The difference between power and authority is quite discreet in everyday dialogue but the difference is an important fact to understand when considering reason and choices that will change one's future.</font></font></font></font></font></font>

that's right. no whiny bitching ever again from this bloke of outrageous splendor.
so thursday: skool was .....skooly. after skool, musical rehearsal. then i went out for coffee with bets. i got an iced hazulnut latte. mmmm.... we talked for a few hours, about everything. i kind of feel like i just started to get to know her. i just learned everything i knew about her over again and more things. that's all i needed. all of a sudden it made me pheel so much more. i'm glad we're best buds.
 then we went to kyle's and waited for him to get ready. then we dropped bets off and went to ben's. 
ben's was a grand time. stella, ben, tj, bobby and his woman were there. tj and bobby left along iwth his laday around 11ish. the rest of us just hung out the rest of the night. we wrote progressive stories and they were hilarious. they mostly had to do with dongs and us four. ah, and more dongs, thanks to stella.
tommy, don't go to sleep. 
tommy, don't go to sleep.
if you go to sleep,
you'll get eaten by a bear.
if you go to sleep,
i'll steal your underwear.
tommy, don't go to sleep.
chitlins.
phriday marked busy again. kyle and i had rehearsal at b. duds house and then we went to fabian's until nine to werk at this pasta dinner thing. we then went to bowling with mollie, betsy, dina, maddie, amanda, paco, and us. neil and dave showed up later and we all went to green'sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssregrubmah. went home, slept till tenthirty. picked kyle up, went to the rencen for our performance. got paid seventyfive dollas. went to ann arbor for the robertrandolphandthefamilyband concert.
on the way to annarbor the most beaaaaautiful sunset was before us. made me think......
the concert was nuts. it was just hours of soul and dancing and having fun. they did like eighteen giant jam sessions and a couple covers. that was.........phun. but more than that. orgasmically phun.
post concert: kyle and i were stuck in the garage in a huge line of cars for a half hour. we listened to incubus mainly on full speakers with the windows open and were acting like tools. we were doing weird stuff.
we drove home and it only took like a half hour or less. almost got pulled over twice. once, the popos threatened with lights then the second used a spotlight. whatev, nothing happened. sleep. then werk at eight con mollie and betsy and stephanie and zach. i had a most triumphant time at werk this week. i just had phun. then kylemolliebetsyandi went to JJ's for lunch. we sat there for liek two hours eating and laughing and talking and rockin it. then i dropped everyone off and got to speak with molllie for a bit. i like talking to her about things, cause she's kind of a neutral on certain things we talk about. it's interesting to get her point of view. well, i shouldn't say neutral. but i enjoy speaking with her, nonetheless. 
i came home and cleaned sable. harry came over and we talked for a bit while i was cleaning. paco called, too. chris is hilarious. ah, man. what a kid.
now i'm relaxing. i lack sleep and i pheel dirty.
where's the bitchin' and moanin in that, huh?
things i'm thinking about right now: bob marley and the wailers, my real journal, my skin, my hair, how i want to go shopping for new clothes. i don't want to go to skool. bob marley incense rocks it good. i saw miss brown. she had brown shoes on. gleaners food bank. sa da te mah damey. rah dig. peaceluv. keepitextraordinary."

i find it so weird how i can pheel so differently about her every moment. but it all adds up to something that i've never felt before, but it's so hard to cope with. i'm sick of saying 'i don't know what's going to happen'. i'm sick of everything, but what i want sometimes isn't what's right. this is so hard. it seems like i'm the only one who knows what i'm talking about. i just wish i really could learn from this, but i can't even see where i'm going. man, i sound like a teenager. have i ever done this before? i sound so............moany. whatev. i don't regret it. i'm tk. i'm on top.

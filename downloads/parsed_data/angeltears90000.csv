"event","Scattered flowers amongst the fallen ashes
Believing, deceiving, holding the ashes as snow in your palm
Holding on to tales of God, just too save your sanity
Wearing thin, running a hand along your porcelain skin
Holding the mask to your face with the other
Held to your face to cover the scars

Holding onto your passion your grace behind closed doors
The memories remain all yours
Once seen in a daylight hour
Now only waking as a broken flower
The moon she sings to you of peaceful things
She will show you the way, the truth
But the truth how it stings

The path is bitter sweet
But they wait for you on the other side
Try to enter but the lies they hide
winding themselves around a veiled truth
Taken to unholiness in your roots
Walking on the frozen shattered hearts
Only one beats through the empty night
It is hers and soon your own

"event","Well last night was fun.  Tried to get drunk on Jagermiester and Sour Apple Pucker but the night ended in the stupidity of my drunken friends and high tollerance sober me.  Really I think my previous migrane swollowed all the alcohol, because after 16 shots of 1/2 jager 1/2 mountain dew shots and about 14 shots of apple pucker I didn't even have the slightest buzz.  My headach was gone though.  

Any how, as the ball dropped my friend shouted that she had to pee, waited 1 min. 30 sec. for the ball to drop and then ran into the bathroom.  Seconds later she shouted drunkenly, ""first tinkle of the New Year.""

Anyway, It snowed last night, so I got my Christmas wish a week late. Snow has always been something I viewed as beautiful and magical.  Too bad it leaves so quickly, leaving behind only the bitter cold that lingers in the air and makes things dreary and mushy out after it melts.  I hope for it to snow again.

I do so now have one small regret.  That I didn't spend the New Year with Mathew.  And my thoughts linger deeply on this because while I could have said yes to his invite to a party, I turned him down because I was afraid.  Afraid of breaking two hearts, his and mine.  I leave for Arizona in 3 months.  No sence in getting so emotionally attached to someone new only to tell them I must leave them now is there?

New Years Resolution: My friends and I have decided to try and loose weight. (I want to loose 15 lb before I leave for Arizona)"

"event","I had a rather good christmas.  My mother and I were kind of upset because he bought all of my sisters and I ipods and charged them to the credit card.  I also got sock monkey slippers, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (leather bound), a James Dean compact, and some pots and pans for my kitchen.

Anyway, my mother out of concern got me to go to the doctor (or forced me rather) because my knee was still hurting from when I fell in october.  So Thursday I went to the doctor and ended up getting an x-ray.  I'd never had one before so it was kind of scary.  Anyway, after it was done they told me they hadnt found anything so they (the doctors) needed to set up an MRI (expensive)! To makesure I hadn't torn any tendons or cracked any cartlidge. 

So Friday morning at 8 am I got that done.  It lasted forever and clastrophobia was sort of setting in by the time it was over I was glad.  Luckly they only had to do the test on my knee.  Anyway, it hurts really bad but I don't get to find out the results untill next week sometime.

"event","I hadn't had a nightmare in months untill lastnight.  I can't explain them at all.  I see no conection to anything that happens before the nightmares nor do I see anything that would keep this going.  I figured facing my fears would change all that.  I figured falling out of the phase of being afriad of men would change it.  I'm still afriad of men, don't get me wrong about that, I'm just not letting it control me as I used to.  However, the dreams still persist.

I find myself in a dark hallway.  I can see nothing infront of me save for a light.  I can tell by its shape that its a door.  I enter and look around.  Its a soft glow within a room.  The room is beautiful don't get me wrong, but he was there.  He didn't move when I entered, just sat there with his back turned.  I kept quiet and went to back away because I didn't want to be there, I didn't want to see him, I wanted to get out and run as far away as I could.  But where was this that I was anyhow?  How could I run when I didn't know where to go.

""please stay""  he whispered softly and then stood up slowly with his back still turned facing the window over looking a city street (I could tell from the lights of cars passing by it).

""I can't and I won't.""  I said to him bitterly wanting desperately to leave.

He grabbed my hand, which startled me because he hadn't been close enough to take my hand just before I tried to turn away and now instantly he was there. I merely figured it part of a long chain of phisical rules broken within dreams all the time.

""Oh but your not dreaming.""  he said as he kissed my hand gently.  I tried to pull it away but he held tight to my hand. ""What happened?""  He asked in a gently tone, not sounding angery but merely sad that I was trying to leave him.

""what do you mean?""  I asked 

He carressed my hand and kissed it.  ""I mean you don't wish to be with me anymore.  You once told me you loved me and now you try to run.""  He let go of my hand and turned his back looking horribly grieved.

""I can't be with you. I hardly know you, what is love anyway?  Could you not find another person?""  I asked him hopping to maybe calm his soul. He told me that such things were ""easier said than done.""  I walked toward him and touched his shoulder; he was much taller than me (Meh I'm short any how 5'6 to be exact), and he turned around, gazing strait into my eyes.  I couldn't help but do the same.  He had lovely dark brown eyes.  Taking his cold hand he touched my neck and put my hair behind my shoulder still starring deep into my eyes.  I shivered a bit and it was then that he kissed me deeply and then pulled back.  

""Don't lie to yourself or to me""  he said sounding cold.

I shivered, it was cold in the room and then I suddenly realized that I was back in my room.  I opened my eyes and it was exactly 3:00 am (It's always 3 am when I wake from these dreams.  ""I hate you""  I whispered.  I tried to get back to sleep but couldn't.  I made some coffee and then watched the sunrise out my window.

Now that I think deep on this... this is my dream, I can do what I damn well please in it.  Next dream I may just attempt to kill him.  Without him there can be no more dream."

"event","Well, my car has officially died.  It decided to commit Harri-kari (suicide) last night and hydro-planed into another car.  It scared me, especially when the air bag came out, and then when I got out of the car the woman wasn't moving.  She's alright though, she wasn't wearing a seat belt and hit her face a bit on the steering wheel.  No harm caused to her or her vehicle.  My vehicle however got the front end smashed it.  The battery is smashed, the headlights, the radiator.  My father seems to think he can fix it and I might move back home and get another job so I can pay for my car and help fix it on my days off.  I hope he's right because I still need that car to get to Arizona.  Mean while I was afraid to drive today so I had my father drive me to school this morning, and my mother's going to pick me up after the CAAP test.  Also, they are going to lend me the car I used to drive when I lived at home so I can get around until the other is fixed.

Mean while Wal-mart (bless their bloody hearts), wouldn't give me the day off on friday so I'm calling in ""sick"" and going to volunteer at the animal rescue league for class credit anyway.  I'm really getting sick of Wal-mart's shit!  They can just go shove it for all I care.  For christ sake, they made me stay at work the other day after I'd thrown up because for the love of god... they ""needed"" me because I was the only one there scheduled that knew how to close down the photo lab.  >_<  I might just quit and find another job."

"event","I'm Sick again. I'm cold because my furnace won't turn on.  I'm so tired of being sick all the time.  Yesterday I was sick and throwing up but knew I couldn't aford to miss work.  I went anyway and on the way up my steps lastnight comming home I nearly passed out.  I keep getting migranes but I'm almost certain that has nothing to do with this.  I'm just weak and tired a lot any other time.  I'm thinking its just stress.  Hopefully this will all pass and I won't be sick for christmas.  Anyway, The following poem is just something I wrote within the last oh... 15 minutes. It sort of reflects how I feel right now.

~Sail Away~

My mind once told me that I should sail away
My heart told me that I should fly away 
But as I began to wander past the distant and present fields of flowers yonder
I began to ponder dreadfully in regret that I should ever think to leave this beauty 

Thane eyes attached to mine soul
Grasping at the ever fading sun as it set into the abyss
Wandering far off into the distance
The distance where there exist sailing ships

This distant sun as it faded away
And so the sailors knew the way still into and through the night
Oh how mine heart reached to them
Oh how the darkness grew hard and brought to me the emptiness

My mind once told me that I should fly into the distance
My heart whispered that I should go far to drift with sailing ships
My heart brought me to memories of the sea
My heart brought me to memories of you and me

Oh to drift on the sea
The blissful ageless see
The sea that whispered home to me free 
The sea full of scents from far off shores

The sea winds how they whispered to my heart within
Of sandy beaches, of flowers galore, 
Or hair that blew within the wind beyond the distant shores
But when you listen quietly not only can be heard the pleasant but the blissfully absurd

The sea winds how they whispered and how they shouted as the waves did roar
Thane name did they call and sing and spit out in distant song and gain once more
Listen to the waves they crash of laughter and unspoken silent tears
Tears that faded into the distant salty ocean darkly

And as I faded back to myself
Opened mine eyes and there it was realized that it was me that had been crying
Darkened was the sky and I pondered if it was foolish that my eyes not be drying
And it came to me, like the whisper, crying releases the soul of loneliness and pain

My mind once told me that I should sail away
My heart told me that I should fly away
But now I no longer regret
But drift away past the field of flowers to the distant shores yonder

My aunt does have ALS.  They aren't sure how bad it is yet and the doctor told her not to pay mind to the things writen on the internet because alot of it sounds worse than it really is and there are different levels.

On other note I'm not leaving for Arizona in January, I decided it's just too much stress.  I'm leaving in April, still a little soon but it still gives me a bit more time. Most of my paper work is in order, the only issue now is the moolah, denario (okay I'll speak english money).

Lastnight was strange.  We had dinner at my parents place but I didn't eat very much because I didn't feel well.  All my family was there and I had a book I had to finish by today so I was reading most of the time rather than paying mind to them.  When I got out of the house I'd finished most of the book but it was 1 am and I decided it was time to head home.  I felt dizzy and had a strong headach comming on.  I was carrying my laundary basket because I'd taken it home for the weekend, and when I got outside it was ice cold and there was frost on my windshield.  I was exhausted and there were points in time while I was scrapping off the windshield of my car that I felt like I would pass out.  

I got home and my cat darted out the door.  I tried to find her in the dark but she was no where to be found.  I gave up and tiredly and began up the stairs.  When I got to the top I felt really light headed and suddenly felt as though something had given me a light shove.  It freaked me to that when I turned around I saw nothing out and I hurried and got inside.  It was freezing and I felt almost as though I were drunk (I swear I hadn't drank any alcohol), but I managed to change and crawl into bed remembering to set my alarm.  I now think back on it and think it was probably just severe lack of sleep and my imagination.

When I awoke my alarm had gone off and had been going off for an hour.  I didn't really have to be anywhere but I wanted to get up to have a head start on homework.  Well that certainly didn't work well.  I felt dizzy like I had a weird sort of hangover (not sick dizzy, just weak dizzy)  I finally made the decission to fake being sick and call into work to get my homework done.  I knew if I didn't it would never get done (stupid teacher giving us a book to read in one weekend anyway).  Anyhow, that was how the day went.  I finally finished the book and now I'm going to hurry and finish this 3 page book report."

It snowed yesterday.&nbsp; I love the snow.&nbsp; Its so pretty.&nbsp; I want summer back, my heart yearns for it.&nbsp; The cold makes me feel so alone and blue.&nbsp; The heat still doesn't work well in my apartment.

"event","Yay I'm sick again (extreme sarcasam).  People kept telling me I looked horribly pale at work today.  I'd just woken up so I figured that was it.  My day went on as usual other than the part about the lab being down because the printer had a chemical contamination and so we couldn't ""do"" anything but mantainence.  I didn't eat much for lunch because I wasn't hungery and nothing looked good.  

When I came back from lunch break Carly asked me to help her put the back panel back on the Digital Print Computer.  While I was helping her my fingers all got pinched and I ended up with a blood blister.  It made me nautious and I was all worried about how it would effect my guitar and the fact that it took up most of the tip of my finger.  An associate looked at it and told me to prick it and let the blood out of it.  This ended up badly because the moment I did I just about passed out.  Our Assistant Manager got freaked out because I flushed out to ghost white and then she  grabbed me and helped me to the back room, and the rest of the day (3 hours) she kept asking me if I was alright.  ~rolls eyes~  I'm strong just because I almost passed out from a little blood (and the key word there is almost) doesn't mean anything, I'm still going to work and I'm still going to tough it out."

"event","Lastnight I had a horrible time.&nbsp; I found out my electricity was about to be shut off.&nbsp; God no!&nbsp; It's freezing enough in this blasted, bloody little apartment.&nbsp; I called up the electric company and got things sorted out for a while.&nbsp; My only thought durring this whole endevour was that I was only glad that I get&nbsp;three pay checks this month rather than the usual two. 

So this morning I awoke cold and aching all over.&nbsp; My lamp light was on and I knew I'd turned it off, or maybe I'd drempt that I had.&nbsp; Either way I was freezing cold and I needed to take my room mate to school.&nbsp; I got dressed warm with a blue and white striped sweater and jeans and put my hair up with a stick (its too complicated to explain at the moment).&nbsp; Stepping groggy out of the house it was cold.&nbsp; I hated it, and the wind burned my skin but the moment the sun fell upon me I felt a warmth.&nbsp; No not the warmth that I love about summer, but a calm warmth, a small relief from that blasted wind that told me winters comming. 

I took my roommate to work and then went back the the apartment and took a quick (okay loooong) shower.&nbsp; I loved it, the water hot and steaming.&nbsp; I swear that's about the best peace I ever have while I am living in this place.&nbsp;Anyway I then got back dressed and went over to my parents house.&nbsp; We figured out some things to help my financial situation (no they didn't give me money, they never would and I don't expect them too either).&nbsp; Once that was figured out I went to work. 

Oh god how I loath my job.&nbsp; Sure people tell me how nice and sweet I am.&nbsp; How kind I am.&nbsp; How no one there has ever treated them so kindly.&nbsp; No I would never treat anyone harshly, but my problem is people walk all over me.&nbsp; People don't care how much I put into the job and they know I don't like to disapoint so they tell me to do everything and I end up staying late.&nbsp; Yes so I worked till 10pm, an hour past when I was supposed to be finished and then they schedualed me for 7am.&nbsp; Why can't I just stand up to someone. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This goes into another story: 

Yes I told you I was sick last week, and infact I was.&nbsp; I feel because of this that I should never be touching alchohol again.&nbsp; Upon going to my friends last week, I began to drink.&nbsp; I started off with a Bacardi because I didn't think I was going to drink all that much.&nbsp; However, when she offered me Black Velvet I couldn't say no (not because I was afraid I'd hurt her feelings but because I love it).&nbsp; I finished my one glass with just a bit in the bottom of the glass (as should be) and I sipped it but managed to finish it before my friend finished hers.&nbsp; I poured more into my glass the next time but not by much and only because my friend had offered me the rest of what was in the bottle.&nbsp; However, my friend dumped the rest of hers into mine as well telling me she couldn't drink it.&nbsp; It ended up being almost clear full after this and I drank it&nbsp;as well.&nbsp; While I&nbsp;was drinking another aquantance of mine came over and found out she'd one 100 dollars on a scratch ticket she'd bought so she got my friend to go with her and they left me alone with my friends sleeping daughter.&nbsp; By the time they'd come back, that glass of Black Velvet was gone.&nbsp; I went to get some Hot Apple pie shot (a glass of it)&nbsp; but they told me they didn't want me to drink for a bit.&nbsp; After about 1/2 an hour they let me.&nbsp; I drank that rather fast, too fast infact and ended up vomiting.&nbsp; I fell asleep that night and woke up in the middle of the night.&nbsp; I felt sick and knew I had to take my room mate to school in the morning.&nbsp; I got up and went to leave and my friend proceeded to come out of the room and yelled at me.&nbsp; She pushed me away from the door and told me I couldn't leave till morning.&nbsp; I wasn't mad at her just upset because I didn't want anyone upset with me but either way someone was going to be.&nbsp; I told my friend this and we ended up talking for hours about how I was so kind and sweet and that she hated seeing me the way that I was.&nbsp; I kept crying and telling her that I hated it when people were mad at me and that I always failed everyone and she kept telling me that wasn't true.&nbsp; After the night was over I had finally fallen asleep and eventually woke up and went to my apartment, took a shower and took my roommate to work, her missing her classes.&nbsp; After all that happened, I hate myself when I drink, I hate how bitter I've become recently, and I hate still feel I let everyone down no mater what I do, as a friend and as a person.&nbsp; I want to change my life around.&nbsp; Arizona will be the new start of the new me...&nbsp; I'm afraid."

Let the light of the moon Cary thee
From twilight to morning light
carrying with it the soft skillful glow of evenings kiss

Sweet beating
Sweet vibrant night
Tis music that I know so dear
Tis the crying that carries on so clear

Tick tock
Oh glorious sweet enchanting clock
Clock that ticks away the midnight hours
If only that time would Siez
Our hearts drifting into one another forever

Nights of soft effervescent breeze
The flowers beauty dulled
until moonlight strikes it with strict evening glow
oh how it drifts both sent and song

Oh how each kiss the night gives
Each painful chill 
Painful chill of life that exists 
A touch within such as evenings touch

How I wish it to Cary thee to the next sunset
Drifts that feeling ever more through hearts on distant shores
Oh how one would be such a fool to ignore
The heart that bore such painful kiss

And as the last beat distincts its self
As the moon faded into the rising sun
As the tear drop fell
She drifted away, 

Cleansed in water and roses
She was carried through
Till the last of evening and breaking of morn
Carrying with her the soft skillful glow of evenings kiss"

"event","This is night three that my house vibrates.  I want to know why.  Time for a little investigation.  Soon I shall find out.  ~glares~  why does this house vibrate.  Its not scary really.  Just rather anoying.

Do you ever hear a love song and wish you had someone in your arms you could dance to it with?  This night of all nights I wish it more than anything.  ~bah humbug~  I want that feeling.  I suppose I just have to wait out my turn.  That or get over it.

Tonight was very cold.  My cough though it started to go away is beginning to come back.  My immune systen is down and I hate it.  My heater isn't kicking on like it should so its about 60 deg. in my apartment.  I can't wait to move to Arizona.  The desert shall be wonderful and warm and I wont have to deal with this cold crap anymore.  I only fear the worst when the snow falls.

I was walking tonight and I looked up at the moon and then back to the cemetery on the other side of me and at that moment I felt the coldest chill within my heart.  I wonder if I'll ever find myself not alone anymore. If I'll ever wake up one morning with someone by my side only to say.  ""I miss being alone.""  Is this such an odd thought?  

Right now no where seems like home.  No where but my mind trying to think back to warm summer memories sitting in my parents house or on the front porch overlooking the street.  Perhaps sitting on the rivers edge with Lori drinking a cold 40 together laughing through-out the night.  Even when I was younger and had angel there was so much more pleasant than this cold empty apartment.  Memories are home.  Memories are full of heart and I will never forget that.  

At the same time that I think those thoughts I had merely been thinking earlier today that I hated myself.  I hate how hard I am on myself.  How bitter I've become.  How alone I am.  How hard my heart has become and yet weakened by my own longing for something that isn't there.  I hate desire.  I hate wishing for something that I'm too coward to have myself, the company of others.  And yet I know myself to never be alone.  Never because I see those that are there.  Those that are different and those I can speak to.  But there's never any attachment.  And of course my dream/nightmares that I wonder that they shall ever end. Maybe this is all the riot before the peace within my life.  After all don't things always become worse before they get better.  I only ever feel perfect peace and perfect calm when I'm singing.  Where does that peace come from?"

"event","Lastnight I went home from work and imediately got into the shower.  I had a horrible day at work and felt like crying.  I hate the way people treat me there.  I went home and turning on the water to a steaming hot state I got in and just stood there with water pouring on me.  I felt disgusting and hurt.  1/2 an hour later I got out (the water was cold), got dressed and went to my friends house.  

My friend has a fear of being alone and her husband is gone for the next month so I made it my obligation to visit her.  She offered me alchohol and I drank at least 6 mixed drinks with rum and jack before getting rather tipsy.  My friend and I began to talk about how she didn't really want me to leave because she'd miss me.  We ended up arguing and then falling back into a small spout of laughter about something silly (this happens a lot).  It finally got to be 4 am and I told her I needed to go home and get some sleep.  She begged me to stay but I explained to her that I had class in the afternoon and needed to go get some sleep.  She understood and I left peacefully.  It was cold, and I hated how cold it was.  I got in my car shivering and went home.

When I awoke it was 11 am.  I hate sleeping in that late even if I have drank the night before.  I got up and got dressed and went to school.  Sitting there my stomach hurt and I was freezing.  I watched my friends eat and then went to class.  Music class and guitar lessons went as usual (god I wish my music lessons could last forever).

Getting out I found myself in another situation that I wish could have lasted forever.  I found myself wraped up in a discussion with Mia.  I love talking to him.  For the first time I can tell someone anything and have them understand what I'm saying and have a response.  He has had a life slightly similar to mine.  Though I love this man for his intelect and his differences I know I could never be with him and it hurts me.  Some things are just not meant to be and I understand this oh so well.

Right now I'm sitting in my apartment freezing wishing I were back home with my sisters.  I miss them. And to think I'm going to leave them for a future.  I'm going to leave everything I know and love for a better life... a life I was never born into but I'm going to make mine.  My friend told me lastnight that that mind set is what is going to get me out of this place.  The mind set that I'm willing to give anything and risk almost everything for what I want.  The mind set that despite how despared I am I will never give up my dreams untill I have them.  I hope she's right."

I'm beginning to hate myself.  I owe so much money to so many people, and now I'm sick again.

Mean while Jonathan bought tickets for Phantom of the Opera and he bought the expensive seats.  I told him he didn't have to pay my way in (because I don't like men paying for me) but he insisted.  So Febuary 4th I will go see Phantom of the Opera.  I'm so excited.  And then my friend Brittany wants me to go see Romeo and Juliet with her in January.

Recently I look in the mirror and I see pain behind my eyes.  I can't look at myself.  People tell me to smile more but I can't find it in me.  I'm exhausted, I feel horribly sad and all I want to do is cry but I'm afraid that someone will see me.  I want to take a lonely walk but its late and I'm a young female (dangerous), hell its been dangerous all my life but I didn't quit my paper route job when I was 12 after I was nearly rapped. why didn't I? perhaps I was stupid because I didn't tell anyone close to me either.

I just don't know anymore.  I can't breathe here.  Its like this place has become a clastrophobic nightmare within me.  I can't wait to leave, to start over, to wash away the tears.  I wish it would rain so I could step outside and stand in it. Feel it fall upon me and cry as hard as I wanted because no one would be able to seperate the tears for the rain.

It's getting cold.  I'm sure in another month or so there will be snow on the ground.  I don't have a winter coat and I always get sick when it get's cold. I can't wait till I leave.  Where I'm going it never snows.  Arizona will be nice.  My friend tells me she might move there, but she might move to Texas too.  If she moves to Texas that's where I'm going after Arizon.  I promised her we'd leave the kid with her husband if we went there and we'd take a road trip to New Orleans.

Its late.  I should sleep but I can't.  I hate being alone at night.  I wish I had someone there but then I'm too afraid.  Too afraid that if I were to ever learn to love, ever find it, that it wouldn't work out, or he would grow to hate me.  I fear that somewhere I will fall deeper than I am now.  I don't want to fall, I want to fly away like a butterfly in the sunshine.  I want to learn to be happy again.

your gone with only these few words

You tell me yet that I don't understand

You tell me I don't understand

Needed someone to hold and to listen to
But most of all, Most certainly
I needed someone
Someone to heal me
Someone to understand

You told me I didn't understand
That I was the one who was ignorant
I hurt and I cried and I bled out from inside
The darkness consumed my fears and my heart and my tears
You were that darkness and you still never did see
That you were the darkness that lived in me
And it is you who are the one who doesn't understand

Enya It's In The Rain Lyrics 
Every time, the rain comes down 
Close my eyes and listen 
I can hear the lonesome sound 
Of the sky, as it cries 

CHORUS: 
Listen to the rain! 
Here it comes again! 
Hear it in the rain! 

Feel the touch of tears that fall 
They won't fall forever 
In the way, the day will flow 
All things come, all things go 

CHORUS 

Late at night, I drift away 
I can hear you calling 
And my name is in the rain 
Leaves on trees, whispering 
Deep blue seas, mysteries 

Even when this moment ends 
Can't let go this feeling 
Everything will come again in the sound falling down 
Of the sky, as it cries 
Hear my name in the rain"

"event","Lastnight I had another nightmare.  I woke up with a bruise on my wrist and my shoulder. Is it possible to dream something and whilst being injured in the dream you are left with those same marks for when you awake?  Maybe I just hit my headboard when I was sleeping.

Also this evening right before work got out I saw this man at the store.  I was rather up set because my co worker had left me to myself for 2 hours while she went off and did something else.  So anyway, this man is there and he walks past the counter and dispite my being angery and probably looking pissed off he gives me the softest sweetest smile imaginable.  His eyes were so dark and yet gentle.  Lol listen to me, I don't even know him.  But seriously, if I were to want to be with anyone, I saw the person inside those eyes and that is the kind of person, the kind of soulful heart that I would treasure.

In other news...The hispanic neighbors are making noise.  I felt like yelling at them and telling them to shut up and that there were people trying to sleep in spanish but I suddenly realized I don't know enough hispanic curse words to get it across to them.  I'm exhausted and there's children laughing outside, a woman screaming or laughing histarically i'm not sure which, and a man yelling something happily and then a horn honking.  Does it ever stop?  We live right next to the cemetary.  You'd think it would be quiet, respectfully peaceful.  Not quite.  It was for a time and then they began to throw parties and such things.
People need to be considerate.  I'm a quiet person.  I don't party.  I want candles, a bathtub, and a book. ~sigh~"

That they're gonna throw it back to you

"event","Okay I'm getting tired of this.  This is day number 3 that I am sick. Three days in a row of vomiting, pain, migranes, and now I'm starting to get this pnemonia like cough, along with a slight fever.  I can't aford to miss work and I have people I want to go see tomorrow (like my sister).  I hate my body, I'm tired of pain, and I need sleep lastnight I was in so much pain it kept me up all night.  Yes I think its time for yet another visit to the doctor (do I need to express how much I hate doctors?).

I would also like to express my hate for the person that just now and about everynight makes their way up the steps near my apartment.  Outside wooden steps on a cold chilly night like this and its becoming more frequent.  There are points when I think its children on the steps but when I look there's no one there.  Oh and a while back there was a cologn scent outside my door.  I don't think my room mate wears cologn.  I will catch them one of these nights and I won't hesitate to turn them in, the morons!

"event","Tonight was wierd.  I went up to my apartment and outside I could smell something.  It was strange.  I couldn't place it but I've smelled it before.  Almost like a flower or something, a strong sented flower.  Getting into my apartment I could still smell it.  I want to know what it is.  The only weird thing about it though was that when I asked my room mate if she could smell it she said she didn't smell anything.  I was all like.. How could you not smell it, its strong, and there's no way you can't not smell it.  She got all woried and asked me if it was gas and smelled the air around her.  But I've smelled gas before and it wasn't that.  It seriously smelled sweet like flowers.  Oh well... maybe I'll find out eventually.  Not like I'm complaining, I think it actually smells nice and calming.

"event","This morning I awoke.  I'd felt horrible the night before and went to bed in complete pain.  So I woke up this morning feeling the pain only worse.  I could barely move.  Feeling like I was going to vomit I went into the bathroom but then I remembered I hadn't eaten anything yet and I'd barely eaten anything yesterday and nothing after 4 pm.  I hurt all over and could barely walk to the bathroom let alone back to my room.  When I got to my room I nearly collapsed, no actually I did fall to the floor and crawl over and fall onto my bed.  I then slept for 3 more hours.  

When I awoke I was still in pain and I only awoke because my room mate was knocking on my door.  She needed a ride to work.  On the way there I found out the concert I'd been planning to go to for months has been cancelled and it was my first and possibly only chance to see HIM. 

My day pretty much went as usual dispite the concert cancellation and sickness.  I was still in pain all day but it slowed as the day progressed and after I'd taken some meds.  I went to my voice lesson and guitar lesson and then went into the student union.

There I met Dan and Mia (pronounced Mya).  Dan left us shortly and Mia and I talked for nearly 4 hours about philosophy, evolution, ethics, time travel, religion, and souls, all fiting into one nice little package.  I eventually had to leave but not before finding out that I'd met him before at my cousins house when I was very young.  He and my cousin had been child hood friends.  Funny how things work out like that.

I still hurt, I still have the pain in the pit of my stomach that wont go away.  I still have the nausiating headach.  There are points when I'd rather die than feel all the excrusiating pain that I feel at that moment but its never constant, thank God!  Anyways, I'm off to sleep.  Buenas noches dear readers.

"event","I hurt so horribly I can not express the pain I feel.  I hate being of the female gender for this reason.  My father would just say suck it up, be strong, its your own fault you ate the apple.  But ya know what.  He can go eat fried worms, because I hurt!  It's times like these I wish I were a man.  Hell, this is the reason I'm anemic too though I'm sure I should just back down and eat meat like everyone else.  Meat makes me sick.  Its a vial substance that disgusts me.  I love veggies but it doesn't seem to cut it.  Anyway, enough with that rant.

Now for the other rant.  They cut down my ferns!  Yes we had tall tree height furns that went up the terrace of our apartment steps.  I loved that thing and thought it beautiful with red and green leaves as tall as the roof on our second story apartment.  Then without notice, I come home today and its been cut down.  Demolished.  All that's left is the stock and the dead stump.  I miss my ferns!  Give them back bastards!

Okay with that said now back to our regularly schedualed program. Better known as Hell Third Rock from the Sun.

"event","I've suddenly realized that I haven't drawn a single thing in about a year now.  My music has slowly over come my art and I fear that I'm loosing it.  I am going to start it back up again. Many things come to mind as I sit here thinking what I might begin.

I was studying for my ethics test today.  I hate studying for that class.  I keep reading over it and within this time, all these thoughts flooding my mind.  Ofcourse the thoughts all have to do with the class, but mostly my thought stricted upon Egoism.  How can all motivations be selfish.  I'm sure there's one dead someone has done that dismisses such a thing.  Hell, I mean someone in a split second reaction pushed a child off the train tracks last year and was killed instantly afterwards as the train hit him instead.  How was that possibly selfish.  The man died instantly afterward.  Of course we don't know their last thoughts, could he have been thinking that god would forgive him for everything he'd ever done if he died doing a good dead and in that split second, and with those thoughts did what he had done and in doing so saved a child?  God only knows the motivations of ones self.  However if one believes in god your supposed to love him out of humility and put yourself intrests aside.  How many people in this age or ever, loved God or Jesus out of pure love with no selfish motivations.  Do we not desire love at some point in time in return for that love that we gave?  Human thought and emotion confusses me and hurts me.  

Today in Altoona, a bomb went off in an SUV blocking off several blocks with police baracades.  How far will one human being go to get what they desire?  Why would one human being deliberately kill another.  Are we not acting as animals in which were never given hearts but act on an instinct to kill?  

A woman not long ago.  She had a best friend, they went to highschool together, were in the same grade.  And one day she went to her pregnant friend and cut her open stealing her fetus.  Killed her best friend and delivered a still born child.  Later in court the same woman admited to killing her three daughters as well.  Those children 12, 7, and 4; were found wet and in the large format dryer.  She had drowned the kids and put them in the dryer.

We have wars everyday, were having one know, and I'm telling you this isn't the last.  Each war seems to be for our own benefit.  Lets conform the government, lets take over something, oh no they are different, lets kill them all and only save the ones that look like us.  Where have all the wars brought us?  Happiness?  Self preservation? Understanding?  Unity? Peace?  No, were still fighting, and for what?  All of the previously mentioned.

Human beings are petty and horrid creatures.  They are given the ability to love but they use their minds to hate.  They use the fact that they know difference to seclude others from their group.  They use the power of knowledge to manipulate and combined with hate to create destruction, chaos, murder, wars, crimes, and for what?  All to make one of us look better than the other or to get what we desire.  We have used our knowledge for the things that were not meant to be.  In all cases we have used our knowledge to not make our lives better with technology, the automobile, to the atomic bomb... but to slowly or quickly erase ourselves from existance forever.  

I wonder, archeologists study those that once were.  Some of their technology was far greater than ours and they weren't poluting the environment, no they used the environment around them to help their survival.  I wonder what the future people will do when they look back on our life styles if there's anyone or anything left to look at those things after we've single handedly suffocated and mass murdered ourselves.

One person can change lives.  But only if there are enough single people for that cause.  What will you do to better humanity.  Will you not conform to the pettiness of society, the hate that humanity has become today?  Will you help or hurt the world for the now and the future?  What can we do?

"event","My last dream was a reocurring dream and quite strange.  I'm not sure exactly what happened but this is as much as I can remember from it as possible.  Some of it seemed like a reocurance but other parts were so different I knew it not to be.

I found myself at a desk. There were lots of papers and I couldn't remember how I got there.  Fallen asleep?  Drunken?  All these are very likely but it was a dream so either way one finds themselves waking so to speak in dreams in the oddest places.  But let me get back to the point.

There I was at this desk.  Cluttered with books, and papers.  It was dark and I could barely see save for the light from the moon shinning through the window infront of this desk.  Standing up I looked for a light but there was none.  I found a candle however and a match and lit the candle.  The paper's had been freshly writen but I couldn't read the hand writing.  Latin, Spanish?  I'm not sure.  I could make out some of it but not everything.  I noticed also suddenly that the room was rather beautiful with french like carved woodwork (not unlike but a bit more detailed than the house in which I used to live).

I move towards the door and it too is rather unique and beautifully varnished.  Mean while I kept thinking to myself where I might be.  God only knows.  I hated not knowing where I was.  My steps were light and barely made a sound. Opening the door it was a long beautiful hallway.  I stepped out into the hallway and looked around.  The candle did well for lighting but not well enough.  It was lit only enough to see a bit infront of me.  My only dread was that someone on the other end would be able to see me before I saw them.

I started down the hallway and felt a cold draft.  Perhaps a window was open.  I felt a chill run down my spine and then I thought I heard a sound.  A voice perhaps, having the distinct tones as a voice would, the up and down pitches, and a slight emotion held within that tone.  Where was it comming from?  Well it was a hallway after all, so perhaps it was from another room. As I made my way through the hallway again I heard something, something close like a whisper, but no words made out.  I thought to myself that I might be crazy.  No one in their right mind would be dreaming this.  Just wake up, for God's sake wake up!  But I couldn't.  I couldn't force it anymore than I had before.  You see these dreams are not only like dreams but like I'm actually there and as though I were awake in that instance.

I suddenly heard the whisper closer.  ""but you are awake.""  The voice said.  It was calming, I knew it.  I knew each intonation, it was soothing and deep.  Suddenly feeling a hand on my shoulder I felt the reaction suddenly to turn around and face him.  What was stopping me?  I felt my hair being brushed back gently and then a kiss being placed on my cheek.  It was cold and I shivered at it.

""Look, I don't want this anymore.""

""Just release all fears, remember. Please.""  he was actually begging me?!  What was I to him anyway?  Who was he? ""I am yours and you are mine."" He answered.

This made me furious. ""Stop this now.  This can't be.  I'm not your play thing anymore!""

""No your my angel.""  He spoke gently again, the words bringing me back to wanting him, wanting his everything, and then came another kiss gently upon my cheek. He then turned me around to look into his dark eyes.  He looked like he was about to cry and I knew he would never let me see him do such a thing.

""Go a head, cry in front of me.""  I said gently.  I knew he wouldn't allow it.  I knew he though he'd frighten me with his tears.  After all had I not seen her tears, the blonde one's tears that night in the cathedral.

""Yes my angel remember.  I love you.""

""Who was she?""  I demanded. ""Why were her eyes bleeding?  Why the wedding dress?  Why was she so sad!?""  I held the candle up so I could see his face better but he backed away.

""Not just yet my angel""  he spoke deeply once more.  ""She was my angel, I can not yet tell you all the details but she ended her life.  She couldn't take anymore suffering.  But I never caused the suffering.  She loved me, she told me so the night that she parrished.""

Backing away from him I shook my head.  ""I don't believe you.  I can't believe you.""  I whispered.

""Please""  he spoke softly back.

I stopped, and he began to walk towards me. I stared at him strait in the eyes.  He said nothing as he stepped closer and then stopped right in front of me.  I kept the candle between us.  Gently he moved my hair out of my face and let it fall behind me.  (no) was all I could think but he didn't care.  I held up the candle again, illuminating his face for only a moment before he threw the candle against the wall with such force that it shattered the candle against the wall, I could hear the peices fly apart and then fall to the floor. I felt his kiss again, but this time deeper, harder, stronger. I felt strength grab onto my arms and pinned me against the wall.  He kissed me again and then I felt something sharp.  Something almost sting through my entire body. God, get away from me! I thought, but I couldn't move.  He had me pinned there.  I then realized I still had my legs movable (duh, within all the fear and horror I forgot about my legs).  I kicked him but it was no use, so I screamed out.  I screamed as loud and hard as I could.  Suddenly once more, she was there.  The ghostly girl I had seen before.  Her dress stained with blood, and almost apathetic look upon her face.  She spoke no words but reached up and some how pulled him back.  

He turned around and yelled out, hurting my ears.  ""Angel, Love?!"" He began looking around for her desperately.  I didn't get it, she was standing right in front of him and he saw nothing, no one, not the slightest of anything.  Of course he wasn't blind, how could he not see what I could see as plain as day.  She soon vanished.  I was of course too petrified to move.  

""She's gone""  I spoke suddenly finding the voice within me.

He didn't move and fell to the floor, I knew he was sobbing but I could barely see his face, small bits of moonlight peeking through the windows and nothing more. Keeping my distance I remained starring at him.

""This can't be.""  he whispered.  ""It never can.""

""How do you mean?""  I asked.

""Us.""  he answered. I glared slightly but my gaze fell soft.  ""I've been trying to tell you all along.""

He turned around and stared at me.  ""You still don't understand beautiful angel.""  

He was right, I didn't.  I didn't understand any of it except maybe for the fact that he couldn't see the ghost that had appeared and I could.  Was I merely just his little gate way to her?  Was I just playing a messenger.  In ways I hoped so, in other ways I hoped not, but I hoped this would all be over soon.

He smiled.  ""Oh it will be."" 

I glared at him once again.  I hated it when he did such things as answer my thoughts. ""you frighten me you know that!""

He didn't answer, instead he walked towards me.  I stepped one foot back and froze raising a brow.  ""no more, you promised.""

He smiled.  ""What good are promises anymore angel?""  

I was beginning to hate the Angel part.  It reminded me of him.  The one I called Angel so long ago, but then it reminded me of love and the complete self that was wrapped within him.  Part of this man reminded me of Angel.  I turned away.  ""I can't take any more of this. Stop hurting me.""  He had been hurting me both emotionally and physically and he knew it, I knew he did, but why did he persist?

He touched my face and then I felt the chill again.  The cold kiss, only this time slightly warmer. I closed my eyes and leaned back into his arms and found myself asleep and back in my bed.  4 am and I awoke again.  My room was cold and it was slightly rainy outside.

Dreams are just dreams right?"

"event","So, I got off work after a horribly stressful day of taking photos, and ended up leaving nearly 1/2 an hour late.  But finally I made it out of work.  It was dark when I left, cold and damp from the bit of rain we'd had earlier.  I hate september rain.  It makes everything seem so much more cold and dreary.

So I open up my cell phone like I usually do and check my messages.  I nearly fall over at the fact that Jonathan called me bless his soul.  I'd told him that I was looking for someone to go to Phantom of the Opera with since my room mate would be out of town that weekend.  He'd called me back to tell me that he would not only go with me but pay my way.  I know it's crazy but I really like him.  He's kind and sweet and hell, I never let men do anything for me but I'm afraid of hurting his feelings.  Yes, any other man I would just simply say no.  But he's so kind I'd hate to hurt him.  I know this can never truely be anything but I'd like to think of it as so for as long as I can.  I also know he likes another girl, and he once even asked me advice as to how he should aproach her.  It kind of hurt, but as a person I love him so much that I helped him out.  Once again I wish it could be but it simply can not.

My medicine is still making me sick.  It's the weekend and I wont be able to get ahold of the doctor untill Monday now.  And so the world turns as I spread my invisible poeticly driven wings, flying about the sky looking for a stirdy or perhaps not drowned piece of land so to speak in my completely unstable life.  But then isn't that what makes one interesting?  How interesting can a completely stable person be? I'd suppose not very so.

"event","I'm so sick right now.  I finally got medicine for my leg.  The doctor wasn't sure what was wrong but told me to stop wearing heals, take anti-inflammatory medicine, then ice it for 20 minutes after work and put heat on it 20 minutes before bed.  This wouldn't be too bad if that medicine happens to be an extremely strong version of Ibuprofen(SP).  Anything with aspirin or NSAID in it kills my stomach. The doctor told me I'd be fine as long as I take it with food.  I took it with food this morning and was fine, but when I took my second pill this-after-noon with food as perscribed, and I vomited.  I'm sorry for complaining, I'm just telling how things are, and they certainly aren't looking up.

Mean while, I went to my Great Aunt's wake yesterday and for the first time since her death I cried.  I couldn't stop while I was in the room so I stayed away from the casket and talked with my grandmother and great grandfather.  I miss her a lot.  I didn't even get to go to the funeral because I had class and I couldn't miss it because the instructor was giving out all the information for the test on Tuesday.  I feel awful for not going but my grandmother told me it was fine and that she would have wanted me to go to class.  I couldn't stop thinking about her during class. I kept hearing my Great Uncle's words ringing through my head.  ""You keep up your work.  Make Annie proud."" I miss her so much.

I also ended up going to a movie for class with a friend of mine.  He's really sweet.  The movie was an environmental documentary and we kind of made fun of it and then drove out of town to another movie that wasn't showing here.  He even opened the door for me and paid for it.  I've never had anyone do anything like that for me before.  He's really sweet I'm just not so sure I can go out with him.  What's stopping me?  Lots of things.

I came home this evening and felt almost drunk nauseous.  Took a shower and it got worse.  I felt like my whole body was pulsing and like I was going to throw up.  I took a steaming hot shower and nearly fell over when I got out despite how good it felt.  Then I vomited in the toilet.  I got dressed and stumbled to the couch sitting there in silence waiting for my room mate to get off the computer and considering just going to bed, but here I am.  I'm so tired and weak, I feel I might vomit again.

mean while, one just small thought that went through my mind... Guitar Lessons and voice lessons are just about the only thing keeping me going right now.  I get to be in the advanced voice concert, and the beginners guitar concert.  Oh and I started my first actual song for guitar and learned the F cord which he told me that he'd never had anyone get it right away before.  Thank god for long fingers I guess.  Too bad Aunt Annie couldn't have heard me play.  She always loved it when I sang.  I wanted to be able to play for her too.

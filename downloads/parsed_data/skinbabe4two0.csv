"event","Ashley and I went to hang out w/ my friend Ken and he brought this guy named Danny to chill too. Now, Danny walks up to me, introduces himself, and is TOTALLY HOTT!!!!!!!!!! We got in the car and drove to this house with a bunch of people in it. We got beer and I got pretty faded and it was so much fun...everyone there was like 18 and older except for me and Ashley...lol. Ashley hooked up w/ this guy named Marc and she really likes him...he's 19. So is Danny...who was totally flirting w/me the whole night!!! He was tickeling me and holding me and calling me beautiful...<br>
Anyways, we ended up getting dropped off at my house at 7. Then, I ""spent the night at Ashley's house"" *wink wink* LOL! They picked us back up outside my house and we went to Terrace View and some other  place in Lakeside. And we faded more beer...I got so faded. Ashley wasn't really drinking but she had a good reason not too...lol. Anyways, Danny and I ended up kissing and making out. So did Ashley and Marc. Ya.<br>
Later that night these girls got jealous of Danny and Marc being all over us instead of them, so they tried to start shit and nothing ended up happening b/c there were 4 girls against me and Ashley...so we ended up going to Danny's place...drank some more...and passed out. Ashley and I didn't want to have sex w/ them b/c we just met them...so no one got laid. But they so wanted too...lol. In the morning, we woke up at 7:45 b/c Danny had to be at work. So, Ashley and I went to her house and then I went back home...
crazy night...ttyl"

"event","Last night (actually like 2 in the morning) was awesome. Bryant called me and we talked forever and everything he said made me happy. Everything...I don't think he said one thing I didn't like. He was talking about missing me and possibly getting back together and how things could be good again. He wants me to come over when he comes back and he says he still loves me and wants me back. wow. Now I can't wait till he comes back. I'm so happy right now...and I feel so loved!"

"event","WOOHOO!!! I GOT MY TONGUE PIERCED...again! it's all swollen and shit and I can barely talk..lol. But I love it! It hurt this time though because there is a scar from my last time...so ya. It looks really good though...<br>
Anyways, lol Bryant called me last night when he was in the club and I thought it was a dream! I thought everything he said on my answering machine was a dream...but I woke up this morning and looked at it and there was a message...bryant! It was really trippy...I must have been half-awake/asleep when it went off.<br>
I had the TRIPPIEST DREAMS! I dreamt there were alien bats attacking the world and if they bit you, you'd die in 3 days...then me and my mom got bit and we didn't die because they found an antidote...then Bryant's message came in my head and I dreamt that he was doing something and then me and my Aunt Kimmy were doing ""stuff"" in this ghost's house and he was flying us around. Then I woke up and tripped out on everything. lol.<br>
OWEE! I tried to eat and made my tongue hurt all over again...damit. I'm so hungry and I can't eat... :( <br>
So, I'm gonna go wash my mouth with Biotene and watch a movie.<br>
Late."

I'm not mad at Ashley anymore, I got over it. But anyways, today was cool. I went with Andy and Waylen and we drove around, did some ""stuff"", and then I got 10 bucks from Andy. Then, I gave the ten bucks to my mom to bribe her cuz I was supposed to be grounded today...lol. But I didn't go home right after my therapist appointment...I walked straight over to Andy's. Which was something I wasn't supposed to do...so I didn't get home till 6:00. At least I wasn't out all night...<br>
I've been going to Summer School, it's pretty fun. In class, we chill and talk and shit. Dori's brother sits next to me and my friend Christina in front of me. And then her b/f and his friends and some other guys I met. So, at least I'm having fun right? But I really need to get more sleep...<br>
ASHLEY!!!!!!!<br>
We need to hang out!!! We should do some ""stuff""...lol.<br>
My birth control shot is making me REALLY BITCHY AND IRRITABLE!!! It's freaking me out!!! GO AWAY!!!<br>
I think I have serious problems...lol. 
ok, bye now, I'm going to bed early tonight- I need the sleep...remember?"

(:-)) then we walked around on the inside a lil bit and then made it back to the fairis wheel.... which was the best part of the night. we started going around talking and she said i hated her joking around and i sid... ""how can i hate the person i wanna be with?"" and she said, "" you wanna be with me?"" and i said ""yea"" and she smiled and stayed quite for a sec and i said, ""so you dont wanna be with me?"" and she said "" are you asking me out?"" and she had this lil smile going and i said, ""yea"" and she said.. YES lol. then i got another kiss (:-)). and then her friend came and were all shocked that we are together and were all happy and stuff... it was a bomb day today.

and tomorrow i have to do yard work to make up for going. but hey it was soooo worth it. i'd pull every weed, rake the whole fucking yard and plant a million fucking plants lol... no matter what my g-ma makes me do tomorrow... it was worth it, christine is worth it (:-)).

I'm at WPLJ sitting at a desk, occasionally answering a phone if it rings. aka im bored. There aren't any other interns here today, so it's just me..haha. Yeah i actually have been sitting at this desk since 10, except for when i go downstairs to give someone their prize, go to the bathroom, or i just went to get food. but at least i get to listen to music all day :)"

"event","I was just sitting here completely bored when I thought ""Hey, I haven't updated in a WHILE!"" Well, once again Scarsdale has proved just how boring it can be. It's finally second semester and I don't have/do any work, so I'm completely pumped for the weekends and to actually have some fun. First semester, while everyone was enjoying themselevs on the weekends (for the most part), I was tryign to get through the semester. Now that I'm ready to actually enjoy myself, everyone wants to be lazy bums! Seriously - did you ever think the day would come when car and I would be bored and hoping for something fun to do on a Saturday night but EVERYONE ELSE wanted to just stay home, watch tv, and do work? I was honestly so confused tonight. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for when it coems to having fun on a weekend, but whatever I'm doing is not it. I guess sitting home isn't really doing it for me anymore. But I just don't know where to go or what to do. Thank god that next year is going to be something completely new and different, and I'll know that if I'm ever bored, then it's MY FAULT and not the ""town"" or whateer. I feel like it's such a waste of a weekend when it's a saturday night at 11:34, you're utterly bored, and you have nothing to reflect on because NOTHING has happened in the previous day or two. Really, I need some drama in my life. I know that sounds a little weird, probably because who the hell WANTS drama, but not only am I physically bored here, I'm mentally bored. There's just nothing to stimulate any interesting thoughts or emotions recently...well, besides boredom. I think there should be one day a year when everyone has to say whatever is on their mind and be completely honest. On that day, you would walk up to someone and be like ""You're really annoying but you're really pretty"" or some guy walks up to you and is like ""wow I'm so attracted to you."" I just hate trying to figure out what people are thinking, and I hate how everyone keeps things to themselves. Like, you really will never know what other peopel are thinking about you, and sometimes you just want to. I'm not saying that 24/7 I'm obsessed with what other people think of me --because i'm not. But sometimes you just need a little boost in your mood or some excitement. Don't you ever wonder what it woudl be like if people said everythign they thought? Everyone would probably get into a lot of fights...but, then again, no one would talk behind each other's backs and relationships could start/end rather quickly without the whole period of ""does she/he like me? ughhh she/he is annoying....is she/he talking about me......etc."" Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if I could just start school again. What would life be like if I went to heathcote instead of qrs? What would life be like if i didn't have a sibling or i were born a month earlier or a month later? Would I be outgoing? tall? fat? depressed? ridiculously happy? Who would i be friends with? Maybe it's just meant to be that I'm living the life i'm living, doing the things I'm doing. Maybe I'm not meant to be having fun tonight, because that's just the way it was intended to be. It's kinda weird when you think about it. Everything in my life could have been different if I had done ONE thing differently in the past. If i had not done one thing, such as go to the bathroom one mintue when i was like 6 or 7, then I would have had an extra minute to do somethign else, which one have changed somethign else, which would ahve changed somethign else, etc. JESUS CHRIST if I had not peed one time or woken up a few minutes earlier at one point, I could be a completely different person right now. HOW FUCKED UP IS THAT? Wow."

"event","Every once in a while I have a day when I'm just confused about everything and rethink everything and everyone in my life. This YEAR has only been that. I feel like so many people are ""finding themselves"" and are content with everything, yet I'm not. I used to laugh at those ""experts"" who discussed the awkward teenage years filled with confusion and unhappiness.... i mean, that could NEVER be me. WTF was i wrong. Everyone that I thought I knew...i don't. Everyone I thought I liked...I don't. Everyone I thought liked me...they don't. I used to be so self-conscious about what other people thought of me, but I don't give a crap anymore. I know people think and talk shit about me, but what the hell can I do about it. All i know is that the people I used to feel confortable around, the things that used to make me happy.....everything and everyone has changed. They may say I'm the one that has, but it's not true...it's them. The thing is that what everyone has turned into , everyone little groups...they don't involve me. And i'm completely cool with that because I want nothing to do with any of that. But just knowing that people have mutated into different personalities with each other really pisses me off. I mean, sure everyoen can change, but when people all change to be like each other and you are left different, who's left alone? It doesn't matter who the fuck has changed for hte better or who has really gotten fucked up. I guess this just means that everyone has found themselves and I haven't. In fact, the reason that I can't find myself is because everyone else has and that has changed EVERYTHING. So I'm tryign to start again and re-find myself because, once again, I'm completely lost. Maybe this summer it will be my turn....because if it isn't next year will really suck. I'm not even kidding....if things aren't different by next year I don't know HOW i can take another year of this. I just can't.

New topic.

Last night i was lying on the couch in my family room watching tv and my parents were in the room, and they started to talk about prom. My mom began to tell my dad that she doesn't think I'm going to get a date, unless one of my friends asks me. My dad then proceeded to ask if i even have friend of the opposite sex. It was then suggested by my mom that my dad take me to the prom. Wait, keep reading, it seriously gets worse: my dad refused. Ladies and gentlemen---even my own father will not take me to my prom.

I feel like every day is a bore and I cannot wait until summer. However, I'm sure that once I reach summer every day will be boring, as well. Only ten days until I see Emily and go to the SOUL game (can't wait!) and almost one month until trip to Hershey (am I the only one ridiculously excited for this? When you combine summer, friends, and a rock concert...you make me very, very, VERY happy).

1. Food (sick of just eating)
2. Movies (refuse to sit in a movie theater for 2 hours)
3. Get drunk (no thanks)
4. Get Ass (not an option)
5. Play car tag/drive around (blehh soooo stupid)

   Well, I went college looking from wednesday to friday. I normally hate taking those trips but it was a nice break so it was good. Let's see...oh friday i got the coolest surprise in the mail! No one will probably care but then again no one reads this so it's all good: I found a large fedex envelope sent to me and my mom, and it was from the bon jovi fan club. Inside was a large autographed picture and an autographed cd by JON! A couple months ago I had written Mrs B a letter requesting something for a silent auction that my mom is part of a group planning, but no one responded. My parents were getting really angry, saying that she had read theletter and threw it out, she just didn't want to give anything. Now we have this! It's soo cool and i hope my parents bid on it LOL! 
   I have so much work to do today to i better get started on it (as soon as this 7th heaven episode about drugs ends LOL [it's the most entertaining show i've seen in a while...no wonder i used to love it!!!])

THe people that are supposed to make me happy are just making me so angry/lonely and I just want to go college looking already so I can get out of this town. Then, when I come back everything and everyone will be back to normal and i will look back on this vacation as a good thing instead of the week-long wishing it would end and I could be back in school.

well...that's all I have for now...see you when i get back. Two things, though: I will either be happy or angry when i get back.

"event","Well, vacation is officially over, and now it's back to school (sigh). Today seemed like the longest day EVER....I never thought it would end!When it finally ended, i was about to give a sigh of relief when i realized that i've had no relief. We still have four more days of school left this week, and then half of a year. Right now I'm focusing on planning the road trip, and i must must must get really serious about the SATS. I'm not going to be ready for march, I know it. I seriously suck at them. UGHHH when will this misery end. My fingers hurt so much from this guitar...i wish i could just play for 30 minutes then stop. No, of course I couldn't do that actually....instead i have to play for around 3 hours until my fingers are on the verge of bleeding. I can't help it, i'm obsessed! 

Just 352,800 seconds left to my birthday, but I don't feel older. And i'm sure in 352,800 seconds I won't feel any older. *sigh*

Well, birthday money is never a bad thing. This time I'm not putting ANY of it into my concert fund...well, maybe only $25, or $50, at max. It's already past 500....i just have like 500 more to go and i'll be all set. So let's cross our fingers I can work at the rec camp this summer and then everything is PERFECT!!!!!! unless, of course, there are no concerts to go to ever again, in which case I will just go on a huge shopping spree and spend ALL of the money in one day. I've always wanted to spend a thousand or so dollars in one day....not that I've ever had that much money, but it would be fun to do if i did :). 

Well, I must go look up more Hershey hotels. It's funny how the motel near Hershey costs less than the CAMPSITE near hershey...either that's a REALLY good deal or there's something reallllly wrong with this motel (think psycho). Yeah, so on that note I shall continue my search!!!! NIIITE"

"event","so maroon bonding party at merrie's was tres fun. we watched pax forever because we couldn't change the channel, ate a shitload of food, watched ""dirty family feud,"" and then people left at like 9...but that's when the realllll fun started lol. we watched christina aguilera for 2 hours (yay for sing who liked what she said and yay for ben who liked what she was wearing), talked about every single person possible (and if you're reading this...we probably talked about you, too), i learend stuff i NEVER would have known lmao, ben contaminated merrie's house....and we nearly died in the taxi ride as riva, jenna, and i are holding hands parying for dear life and ben is searching for his seat belt because the bitchy taxi driver got stuck in merrie's driveway on the ice. oh fun. 
so for those that left early, you missed out. the real 'bonding' didn't start until later. and for those that didn't come, it was fun :). new plan: maroon party after EVER friday layout, different house each time HAHA"

Only tomorrow left of school and its over! i cant decide if im coming to school on friday or not..i mean, i have 3rd free...5th free...6th psych (aka free)...the only thing is math. if we're having a party, im not coming. 
Tomorrow I have a french and physics test. i would be studying, but instead i'm procrastinating here lmao. i actually need to figure out this maroon article....exactly WHAT i'm doing.  2 more days until HANNUKAH! you know what that means...VACATION! while in whistler, i plan on being productive. i will use the gym and get work done. on the plane, i will have made a bon jovi, billy idol, matchbox twenty, goo goo doll mix that is out of this world. it will last for the entire ride to whistler. and that's that. it will have EVERYTHING. and i will write my maroon article on the plane (if i finish my interviews? I will..i better eh). or i will do my work, or read a book, or something. whatever i do, it will NOT involve 6 hours of watching the movies on the back of the seat, you know, the movies that you've seen 5 times yet you're wasting your time watching again? yea, thats it. 

i just made chocolate mousse for a french *party* tomorrow....it's gross don't eat it. seriously..don't.

"event","so on this wonderful ICE day that we have today, i have discovered many things (and its not even 12pm).
number 1: i am not motivated to do anything
number 2: nobody reads this live journal
number 3: my parents think i hae no musical talent
number 4: the world thinks i have bad musical taste
number 5: jen gets more than i do....
number 6: carolyn's eternally horny
number 7: i've kept my diet for 2 days..WOH!
number 8: this vacation i will catch up on my music...

i have two options: face my biggest fear and attack the millions of spiders inhabiting my guitar; or give up the guitar and find another instrument.

basically, none of those options work. i just finished learning the chorus to these days and im PUMPED so im definitely not giving it up. yea. so wonderful.

tomorrow we find out about maroon. we were supposed to find out yesterday, but their meeting was canceled bc of teh snow. so theyh changed the meeting to today--and school was canceled. so now it's changed to tomorrow...AHHHHHHHHH!"

"event","at the request of some people, i thought i'd post my concert review from a couple weeks ago.
(taken from  the boards...)
this is not just a review, this is my entire jovi experience ...so if you don't want to hear about it...stop reading 
but anyways, most of you know from tlaking to me that i was EXTREMELY excited for this! my parents were taking me down to ac, and were going to hang out in borgata while i went to the show by myself. so anyways, as we're driving down to ac, we pass teh ""welcome to new jersey"" signa dn i started screaming! once we passedt eh exit for sayreville, i knew i was in jovi land!!!! we finally get to ac after what felt like forever, and we rush to get the ticket...i get section d, row g seat10 (if anyyone was sitting near there lol). then we go and hang out int he hotel. i see a large crowd gathered around who i think was kathy rush at one point, and every person i passed was either wearing a bj or sambora shirt hehe! also...every single car had a bj university sticker on it...i was in heaven!!!! anyways, we go back to trump and i get ready, then head back to borgata to get something to eat. while im eating, we can pretty much figure out that everyone at the otehr tables was going too! also...i suddenly hear livin on a prayer over the speakers of the casino...wow! at this point, i coudl hardly eat i was so excited! we then go outside to see a massive line at about 6:45, so we get on it. 7:00..the ilnes moving and im going up the stairs! ahhh! my heart was pounding! i head over to the merchandise (duhh) adn buy myself a tlfr tshirt , then wait to go in. omg...when they let us in , my jaw just dropped. i felt like i was in my high school auditorium...except this wasREALLLLLLy nice and it had bon jovi in it hahhaha. i get up to my seat...wow....closest to the stage ive ever been. i talk to some people around me, to passt he time, and then a comedian comes on around 8:15. he was pretty funny! then...the wait is on! at around 10 to 9...bj come on the stage!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! richie had a whole halloween-y themed shirt giong on lol, and jon....oh my jon lol......he looked AMAZING! ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. they started into wanted, and then living on a prayer. but after the first half of the first verse...jon said *stop* because they were in the wrong key, so then they started again lol. i dont know the exact order of songs, but all i can say it was AMAZING! they talked to us, made jokes, told stories lol, broke out into random songs and dances.....all i can say is that if you didn't like olivia d'abo's voice and missed richie/jon harmonies.....enjoy tonights show because THE HARMONIES ARE ALLLLLLLL THERE!!!! bad name....omj....most incredible song of the night (imo)....jon just went all out and did these littel dances and added all thsee words and it was incredible ...it got such a standing applause! they played a cover of a song..not sure the title (from before my time lol)....but it was SOOOO good! they also played sleep when im dead, LOVE FOR SALE!!!!!, misunderstood, joey, and get this....blood on blood (ahhahhaha jess!!!) o...and did i forget to mention they played LAST MAN STANDING AND THIEF OF HEARTS?!?!? AHHHH THOSE SONGS ARE INCREDIBLE!!!!! lets see what else happened. ... im totally blown away by richie's talent....he just let rip on all of the guitars and i was sitting there in awe! o...and jon took off his shirt for a moment....um...and i repeat...JON TOOK OFF HIS SHIRT (aka unbuttoned lol)!!!!!!!! and at the end.....people started running towards the stage where the tables were. i still sat at my seat...not really sure what to do...but finally i was like ""o hellz no"" and just ran for it....i was 5 feet from jon....FIVE FREAKING FEET!!!!!! i've never been anywehre near that close EVER BEFORE!!!! i almost passed out cold right there!!!! of course, they made us go back to our seats...but those 20 seconds felt like eternity for me and it made my night soooo memorable! also....i always read concert reviews and seet eh videos and hear about the stories...but it just doesn't seem real. bumping into obie, seeing his sww pendant really got me to say ""woh....it's all here!!!"" and to watch all of the bandmembers joke around with eachother was amazing! jon said at one point that he was having an *off* night..but if that was *off* then *on* must be on FIRE!!!! haha i met so many people from the fc....my parents bonded with fc members while waiting for me...they were like ""how do u know our daughter?!?!?!?"" omg almost forgot! after the concert, i went to a place in teh hotel and got osmething to eat, and the guy that was behind the coutner asked how the concert was, and i todl him ""GREAT!"" and he said < ""yeah, they've been here all week. i hung out with jon last night...and i used to caddy for him"" i was like ""ohhhhh....."" and he said ""yea, hes supposed to be in the restaurant next door after the show tonight"" i was like ""MOM DAD LETS GO EAT IN THE RESTAURANT NOOOOW"" haha...but they had already eaten there so it wouldn't have worked...i didn't believe the guy either lol. but, we hung around anyways to just soak in all the excitement of the fcers and fcers going tonight, and my mom decided to talk with the 4 (yes FOUR) securitytype boucner people in front of the restaurant. she was like ""please....can i go in' blah blah blah i was liek ""stupid mom"" but the guy said...""no you cant see him, and hes going though back doors so you won't see him"" so bascially that proved that jon WAS going to be in there/ WAS in there at that very moment lol. i cant wait to post my pictures....not of the concert (obviously)but my dad took pictures in the hotel, and a pictrue of me going down the excalator (sp?!) when it ended!!! supposedly, many people said the concert sucked, they came out of it screaming that....but i dont care because i thought it was AMAZING!!!!! if i can think of more details i will.....but i am just still in shock about how amazing it was!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","i have a lot of frees today. a lot a lot a lot. jablo no here again :) so...1st, 3rd, 5th, & 7th....ouch...and 2nd is history (aka free lol) and 4th is math (aka boring) and 6th is psych (test only takes 20 minutes...aka 1/2 free). anywaysim rather bored right now, but my feet are quite confortable :). nothing has really happened in the last day. i had NO homework last night (zero...zipppo.), yet i still managed to not have everything done that i had to do and went to sleep past 11...as usual. um. thats just sad. i recorded friends and sat down to watch it at 9...damn directv was experiencing technical difficulties and it was just a blue screen recorded! so my tv wasn't working at all last night...so i decided to check what was recorded on tivo. all my stuff. (seems to be a big jovi-tv month and our wishlist is just piling it on lol). well, i saw that Little City had recorded! that and row your boat are the only 2 i haven't seen yet, so i decided to watch little city. i watch about 40 minutes of it. man, is he in that a lot. its actually really good, i think i'll watch the rest today :) 

i hate that everytime i try to be artistic or athletic or something else my mom always looks at me weirdly. i went to go downstairs the other day to run, and she gave me the strangest look and was like ""dont you have stuff to do?!?!"" yup, so i dind't run. and then , last night, while listening to he musically AMAZING 'this left feels right,' i was suddenly inspired to learn how to play the new its my life and born to be my baby on the piano (havent played in a LONG time). so, i go to the piano, and start soudnign out iml (playing pretty well, might i add...really sounds like it) and she comes in like ""what are you doing?!?!?!??!"" so im like ""...nothing"" and just get up and leave. ugh. but anyways, im sick of frees, but im not going to say that outloud because i've wanted teachers to be absent so badly, and when they finally are, i wish they weren't (but comeon...first free?!? i'd much rather be sleeping! and every other free?!?! that's just plain annoying!) it would be so nice if my teachers are absent next friday, because i really don't want to have to miss math, history, and physics to go. maybe i won't miss physics, since that's early...and probably not history . but if we end up leaving early now, no way i'm gong to math...besides, we never do anything on fridays anyways..but still, i don't want to miss it if i don't have to (although this is quite a good cause!). okay,i think i'm rambling again. i just get so bored during these frees. i even did half of my history notes for the weekend!!! wahhh....drivers ed today....and i dont think al's going....i am NOT driving alone with that old man....i need witnesses!!! ahhhh...maybe it'll just be canceled! wouldn't that be nice :)
ok, im out...maybe i'll go check out that new rolling stone mag ...before roger gets to it during third free...and then we'd have another argument over music...and he'd win because he always does because i just give up i get so annoyed. so yea, gonna go read that in these last few minutes. shiiit. once again, the comp says 8:55, but the period ends at 8:54. i SWEAR the library is out to get us!. and there the bell is now! 
ok. im gone."

"event","it's been a while, guess i just totally forgot to update (whoops!). well, i'm in school right now. story of my life: i have fist and second free (jablo no here) but i am lonely and bored out of mind. sittin gin the library studying for a french test i'm going to fail, doing sat work. this sux. only 8 more days until atlantic city concert. i hope i don't hate that i'm going a lone. i mean, everyone there is as obsessed as i am...but everything there is like 10-20 or MORE years older than me...and i going to be sittin ga lone the whole time or will they recognize who i am? o well...it will stil be good. let's see...nothing exciting at all. i can't stay focused on my work. the sad thing is that the only reason i'm updating this is because linda told me to yesterday...if she didn't tellm eto...i'd probably continue to say ""eh..i'll update later"" because no one read st hese, and literally...i'm talking to myself right now. but oh well, tomorrow when i can't remember how i felt today i can look at this and be like ""oh yea...like crap"". but theres no real reason whhy i feel like crap, its just cold, early, and i'm tired and sick of school. this feel s like the longest week ever...and it's only the third day of school! i mean, seriously, we have onoly had 2 days of school....that's just p,lain sad! i wish i would stop procrastinatin g on my history work...because i have a SHITLOAD and its all gonnab edue at the sam etime in 2 weeks...literally. oh well, maybe i'll do it this weekend. i got my new cd on tuesday! everyone hates it (ie everyone who isn't a huge bon jovi fan) but that's because this isnt an album for them. why would they like it? they see it as a stupid remix of songs that weren't eeven broken...don't fix what isnt broken, right? wrong...these songs are awesome, and only serious fans can truly appreciate what our bouy sohave done with these songs...who wouldathunkit that bad name could sound country? not me...thats for sure. ok
the bell should be ringing soon. actualy...i think it has already...because it says 9:49 on this comp but i believe it rings at 9:46...hmmm.... conspiracy i tell you! the library is out to make everyone late! but thats okay...i can delay going to madame mace's homeroom for  just a bit....ugh.....oh, and there's the bell now. late i tell you, LATE!
im out!"

"event","this school year is getting porgressively worse. really, its only the second week or 3rd week and im basically suffocating. so much work , so little time, and i dont know whats going n in a bunch of my classes. not only that, but i feel disgusting adn lazy and i just want to go to sleep before 1 am on a school night bc im so tired its insane! this is just too stressful! and of course in the light of all of this im convinced im the most horrible friend ever. really. first of all, it cant be a good thing when you start to question if you actually have ANY friends, right? secondly, receiving an im from your best friend questioning your friendship and whether the two of you will be friends again is not exactly comforting. and then a day later another im to call a friend because you havent spoken in a long time just makes you feel like shit. im so caught up in my work that ive just dropped everything else. 
i wish i were an alcoholic so i could just drink my problems away. but im not. so i wont. and ill just sit here on a saturday and keep working because i am unable to define the meaning/purpuse/fun in my life..and if i cant, who can? im just so lost and i thought i found myself this summer until i came home and everything just became more confusing. i just wish it were the summer again when tehre were no problems, and i i couldnt fight w/ my firends if i tried. i miss the perfection of summer. everything is just spinning out of control in this stupid town and i wish i were with my maui 4 again. not even bj is helping...i cant spend more than 2 minutes at the website without beng bored. i feel like im waiting for somehitng..but i dont know what that 'something is'. im craving something but i just cant put my finger on it...mabye it has somethign to do with my dream from last nitht...am i jealous of people? is that why im so angry at everyone? i know i dont want what they have or whatever, but maybe its the idea. when i talked to car it seemed that all of our friends were changing or different than they were, and thats why we were annoyed with some people...but after thinking about it for a day night, maybe the world isn't chaning around me, but im changing and im just not really sure what i want for this *new* person. ugh i just dont get it. 

ill go read the scarlet letter/work and then run my problems away."

"event","Ok so I had fun at the golf tournament thing. Got to see a lot of people. LOL the only golfer I new was Tiger. So yea that was great. Um uncle Cliff died Saturday the 21. The calling hours were Tuesday and the funeral was Wednesday. After the funeral everyone went to the families house for a cook out. I miss Cory and all of them so bad. I was messed up for a few days. Like everything made me cry. And my eyes were swollen. Cliff was a great person and he will be missed. I start school next Tuesday. Yay Actually Im kinda excited since this will be my last year. LOL I hope. I've been helping Erin move these last couple days. I love there house. I feel right at home when Im there and it reminds me of our house on Celia. The only thing I really didn't like was the whole spiders thing lol. I get to clean the house tomorrow cause grandmas coming home. This weekend Im going to dads for a cookout and then Monday Im going to Aunt Ritas for another cookout. I woke up at like 12:30 pm today and went back to bed at five. Then I woke up at ten and I'll probably stay up till tomorrow night. So Bethany and I still aren't talking. It's pretty shity when your friends with someone for seven years and then they choose some ass over you. LOL o well I should have gotten rid of her years ago after all the shit she put me through. Damnit now I got myself all pissed off and I could probably go on and on about her lol but don't worry I won't. Ok well I think Ima go watch Interview with the vampire :o) Later."

How come we dont even talk no more
And you dont even call no more
We dont barely keep in touch at all
And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now
After all the years we been down
Aint no way no how, this bullshit can be true
We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So young, so full of life in vibrant side by side wherever you weres ridin i went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When ronnie died you weres right by my side with a sholder to cry on
Tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood i did
Sometimes i just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours
And mine i survived it, you ran the streets, i 9 to 5'd it
We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then i blew up
To both yours and mine surprises
Now i feel the vibe i just cant describe it
As much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold, you touch its like ice
In your eyes is the look of resenment
I can sense it, and i dont like it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]

It was my dream at first to be on spittin a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got burst
So i came out i woulda killed a nigga first
Before i let him disrespect me and check me over some worste
Some bitch that i wasnt with i would hit her then quit
But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you dont get involved in it, you was smokin the chron with her 
Comin out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk
Like yall was husband and wife or somethin
But me catchin you fuckin other niggers musta hurt you pride or somethin
Cuz you wont fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me
When all i tried to do was show your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced
You actin like i aint you man and lyin like she can't be loose
But i am really you friend, i'm jus trying to tell you the truth
But dont hate the game or the player
Cuz the one that is changing is you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Proof]

You're only at the top cuz my homie had to stop
Now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
Homies in the hood only she be on the tube
Only gossip on the porch get to speakin on who
Fools i used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin and *poof* it jus happen
But PROOF is jus actin out the party was stoned
Shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home
See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends
Whenever real intelligence thats forever till the end
I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives
And wastin my times with these snakes in disguise
(how come) when you talk its with bitter is fight
And (how come) it's my fault for what you did with your life
And everytime i go to hear you and play you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.

[Chorus]"

"event","Ok so Wednesday I went and saw Moriah. She had her baby on Tuesday. He's so cute. His name is Timothy. He was born 7-20-04 and he was 7lbs 4oz and 20 inches long. I got to hold him twice. I cried. lol anyway both him and Moriah are doing good. She seems like a pro. So after mom and I visited her I had to go to the doctors because of this chest pain I've been having. So anyway I had an EKG and it came back ok but then the doctor found that I have Mitral Valve Prolapse. Its not that bad but it can cause some kinda bad stuff. But don't worry I'll be ok. LOL leave it to me to get the weird stuff. Anyway on the 29th I have to go get an echocardiogram done on my heart. O the Mitral Valve Prolapse has to do with my heart. So the pain I've been having is either from that or from inflamed walls in my chest. *sigh* There's always something. Today mom and I went and saw grandma. I enjoy going and playing games the whole time. She might get to come home in like the beginning of next month. Well, she has to stay at aunt Darlene's for a couple weeks first cause she has one floor. Hmmm I get to baby sit Mikayla Monday. I love her lol she's so cute. OK Ima go. Later"

We ended up not staying till they closed cause we were all tired. Well, Erin, Randy, and I were tired mom wasn't cause she slept in the car for a while. Anyway I had a good time. Saturday I went and baby sat James and Elizabeth. It wasn't that bad they were both really good. And today I went and visited grandma. She might get to come home really soon. I like going to see her cause we play games like the whole time. It's fun. Cause we bet and I win a lot lol. Dude I thought there was a spider on my head just a second ago. lol Anyway so I called Edwin Shaw Friday and signed up to work well volunteer to work at the firestone golf tournament August 17 and 19.

"event","So mom had that test done last Thursday. It came back ok. Last Saturday I watched Mikayla. She's so cute. :o) Today Erin and I went and painted the new fence they put up at the cemetery that we helped clean up. It was very messy. I was covered from head to toe with black paint. LOL what a sight. It was fun though. I might volunteer to help at a golf tournament in August. That will be fun if I get to do it. Today mom went to the doctors. She got her cast off but now she has to wear this brace thing for two weeks. She's allowed to take it off though when she's at home resting or whatever. Tomorrow Erin, Randy, Mom and I are going to Geauga Lake. Yay I can't wait. I saw one of my ex's today at Acme. Can you guess who it was. If you guessed Dusty you were right. UHH he's so cute it makes me sick. He hasn't changed a bit. LOL when we left he was still walking home and we passed him and I kinda felt bad cause it was raining and I kinda wanted to give him a ride but o well. Friday mom and I are gonna go see grandma and then Saturday Im gonna baby sit James and Elizabeth. I called Moriah yesterday. She's the one thats prego. Anyway I was calling her to tell her that when she has the baby I would like it if she has someone call me to let me know how the baby is doing. So anyway she told me the baby is breached so there gonna do a sea section Tuesday at eight a.m. I hope everything goes ok. Well Ima go. Later"

"event","Hmm it's been awhile lol So a few weeks ago I stayed at my aunts house and watched my nine month old cousin while his parents were at Dominican Republic. Taking care of a baby is harder then I thought it would be. But after the first day when we got used to each other everything was ok. He's a little cutie. Every time I see him now he has a big grin on his face. So I was done watching him a couple Wednesdays ago and then Thursday I watched me cousin caitlyn (lol don't remember how to spell it) and then Friday I baby-sat my cousin Emma. I've really been busy. I love watching my cousins though cause there so cute. So Grandma is doing better. She has four more weeks before she's allowed to put weight on her leg. I try to get out there with mom a couple times a week. We play games for like four hours straight. Sunday Erin and I went to church with dad. It was ok. Then later Erin, Randy, mom and I went downtown and saw the fireworks. I had fun. I love the fireworks. So then yesterday mom and I went to Aunt Rita's to celebrate 4th of July and they got grandma out of the nursing home for the day. We ate and swam. It was fun. And today we went back over there to help them finish the left over food and we swam. O Josh if you read this Mike and aunt Rita and uncle Dick are always asking how your doing and what your up to these days. I just thought you might like to know :o) So anyway uncle Dick taught me how to play poker. Now Im addicted to it. lol Thursday mom has to have some kind of test. She wont be allowed to drive so Randys gonna take her. Ok well Im gonna go play poker :o)

She'll only be 6 months old on the 14 and she already has 2 teeth. She's also 20lbs. But she is so cute and she's the happiest baby I have ever seen. K anyway after that I took a lil nap then I mowed the yard. It took me 2 1/2 hours. lol You would think we had a big yard. So Tuesday I worked my butt off around the house. I cleaned everything. Shell and her mom and dad came in from Dayton Wednesday morning. They came and visited us for a lil while. That was the first time mom and I met her parents. They're really nice. So after they left our house mom and I went to Marcs and CVS and stuff. Then we watched 2 movies and went to bed. Today Erin, Randy, and I were gonna go swimming at the hotel Shell was staying at but it turned out that only the guests were allowed to swim. But that was ok we still went to the hotel and visited for a lil while. So when I got home I finished watching a movie with mom and Im gonna go to bed soon. So Im hoping Lee and I get to go bowling soon but Im pretty much booked till next Monday. All righty no ones online to talk to so Im gonna go to bed. Later"

We rode around on the golf carts for a lil while and then we had a big fire. We had some chips and marshmellows. :o) They were good. I had a lot of fun. On Sunday Lee and I went to the movies. We saw The Day After Tomorrow. It was good but not like real good. I don't know. So anyway that was the first time I ever met Lee in person. I've talked to him online for three years though. So anyways he's really cute and tomorrow we're gonna go bowling. Hehe I haven't been bowling in forever. Monday went to Aunt Rita's house for a cook out. It was ok cept I was really tired. The nursing home let my aunt and uncle take grandma over there for the day. It was nice. The pageant people called me Tuesday to let me know I was accepted to be in the pageant. I got really excited and started thinking of how I was gonna come up with the money then last night I just decided that I didn't want to be in it. It's so much money and if Im gonna pay that much money for something Im gonna make sure it's gonna be good. So o well I'll be ok and I'll find better offers or what not. So mom called them today to let them know I wasn't gonna do it. Moms right arm is looking a little better. The bruise isn't as bad. She just got a cast put on her left arm. Took them long enough. Today went and saw grandma. She's doing real good. She's ready to come home though. But who wouldn't be. Sunday is Moriah's baby shower. I still can't believe she's prego. She's due like July 23 or something around there. Ok well Im gonna go. I have to finish the dishes and stuff. I think the computers about to quit again on me anyway. Later

"event","Ok so yesterday I went to the doctors. Everything is going good. With that. (For those of you who know what I had surgery on) the nurse that did the tattoo said in like 6 months she might have to make it a little bit darker. So anyway the doctor re-pierced my ears for me. Cause the backs closed up. My right ear keeps itching. So later that day I went to that pageant thingy and it went well. All the girls were interviewed. They call Tuesday or Wednesday to let me know if I was accepted. If I was I don't think Im going to do it. Cause if I win I get to go to Florida and participate in another pageant for free but my mom has to go with me and she would have to pay for herself which would cost like $645 or something around there. I don't know what Im gonna do. Right now Im waiting for Lee to sign back on so we can figure out what were going to do tonight cause we were gonna go see a movie but Im not to sure whats gonna happen now. Today mom and I went and decorated grandpas grave. It looks really good. Ok well mom needs my help so later.

"event","Wow so today was kind of interesting. lol not really I just didn't want to say it was another boring day. Anyway so grandma broke her leg again. This time she broke it right above the rod the doctors put in her leg. Well, now she has to have surgery again. There looking at Monday to do it. Ugh I feel so sorry for her. She doesn't like surgery. Sooo moving on. most guys suck ASS. Seriously. Like there's this one guys I have talked about a few times in here but I never mentioned his name just in case he ever read this. I always refereed to him as him or he. Well, anyway his name is Bruce. He's the one I had a crush on at bowling. I liked him a lot. Probably more then what he ever realized. He said he liked me too and I really did and still do believe him. See he lives a lil while away. And I still really like him a lot. I just don't know how to tell him without being rejected. Well, I probably wouldn't be rejected I would just get more broken promises. But I don't even think he knows he broke his promise. O well Im used to broken promises. So anyway Bruce and I started talking again a couple weeks ago. I really thought that maybe just maybe we might actually go out this time. But duh me I should have known better. So anyway once again I was lead on. I asked him if he had a girlfriend and his exact words were ""not a gf...a real good friend...not official yet"" and then he went on to say ""don't know if its gonna be"". Now how exactly am I supposed to feel about that. Should I be happy for him or hurt? Hmm well to tell you the truth Im hurt. He once told me he didn't want to hurt me when this whole time he has been hurting me. Just because Im not glass doesn't mean Im not breakable. So anyway I think the next time I talk to him Im just going to have to tell him how I feel. Other wise he'll just keep on hurting me and he'll never know. Ok well I guess Im done venting for now. I've been talking to Lee this whole time. So Im just gonna go talk to him. later"

"event","So this morning mom took Erin and I to the cemetery. We had fun. We met this older guy who was really nice. His name is Rich. Then we followed him around. lol not the whole time. Im really sore right now but it doesn't matter cause it was for a good cause. So I went to babysit my cousin tonight and I ended up only being there for like 2 1/2 hours. Long story. But it was ok I still got paid good. Even though I feel bad for taking the money. Anyway do you ever feel like someone is telling you something when they don't really mean it. I hate that feeling. O so today I saw this guy that I had a crush on last summer, in front of his house with his girlfriend. That was kinda a blow to the heart. but o well Im not even sure if it was his girlfriend so. but still yall know the feeling. O brb have to go potty. Ok so where was I? O yea so anyway I was supposed to go to the mall this weekend. But my friend didn't call me. O well I should have known better. Im sick of putting my heart on the line every time and then it just gets broken. I should probably quit doing that. Maybe I should start following my head instead of my heart. They never agree on anything. Like for David my heart says yes but my head says no. The same thing for this other guy. There was one guy. The guy I was talking about earlier. The one that I saw today. Yea him he's the only one my heart and my head agreed on. Wow I never realized that until I was just typing it and really thinking about it. Well, my head and my heart agreed on him before he left me. Now Im having mixed feelings for him because I never found out the real reason he left. Look at me Im rambling. I always ramble. O well Ok I guess Im going to go watch another movie with my mom. I was gonna wait to see if someone got online but I decided not to cause if he really wanted to talk to me all he has to do is call. kk night all. :0)"

"event","Wow its been along time. So um you know I really dun care that nobody reads this but my sis cause Im really just venting. And really I just want my journal to feel sorry for me cause I don't want anyone else to. Right now Im just chillin with my sis and listening to music. So things haven't been to good. Things with my dad are chitty. I went to Norwalk with uncle chuck 2 weeks ago it was fun. So um I get to have surgery in the beginning of next year. I know my fkkn dad probably won't come cause he didn't the last 2. He is really gettin on my fkkn nerves. Im gettin really tired now. Wish I was acting right now.  Sean called me the other night. First time in awhile. For those of you that don't know we met in the hospital. He's a great friend and I'll always love him. One of my other friends fkked me over. I always seem to get used. I mean do I look like I wanna be used cause I don't. Jackasses! Leave Me The Fkk Alone! Demmit I thought I had a friend over the summer but um he left. Another user. Mother Fkkr. I wish him the pain I have had to go through because of him. I know thats wrong but really thats how I feel right now. He stopped coming around didn't say a word never called me again or anything and got a girlfriend. I have to say though she is pretty. She really deserves better. You know what suxs all of your old friends fkk you over. You know the ones you were friends with forever and thought you could trust them. Like this one friend never calls or anything. He really fkked over his old friends. Now all he ever talks about is his new friends. Never says hey to us or he loves and misses us. Who was there for you when you really needed someone. Who was there when you needed somewhere to stay. We were the ones that were there we were the ones that really understood. How do you think this makes me feel? Huh. You really make me feel like shit. You know who you are. And now you know how I feel. I really miss you but it seems you don't give a fkk. You know what else suxs you were there when we needed you sometimes, where are you know? huh. I don't even know if your gonna read this. I don't know how your gonna feel after you read this but I guess it doesnt matter. Cause Im not gonna care about your feelings this time cause you dont seem to care that it hurts to lose a friend.  All righty then Im gonna go then."

And a time to every purpose under heaven:

A time to kill, and a time to heal;
A time to break down, and a time to build up;

A time to weep, and a time to laugh;
A time to mourn, and a time to dance;

A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;

A time to seek, and a time to lose;
A time to keep, and a time to cast away;

A time to rend, and a time to sew;
A time to keep silence, and a time to speak;

A time to love, and a time to hate;
A time for war, and a time for peace.

"event","So today I slept a lot cause my tummy was cramping and I didnt feel so good but now that I ate and had the heating pad on it I feel better. Geez all this war stuff is freakin me out. Everytime I heard a plane fly over the house Id wake up and be like omg were bein bombed. Then I kept hearing these weird noises that sounded like the bombs on the Pearl Harbor movie before they went off. I probably shouldnt have watched it with all this stuff goin on. Then someone turned on the patio light whitch is right outside my bedroom window and as it starts up it makes this loud noise and I woke up and saw a bright light on my wall and was like omg theres a plane outside shining a light in my window. yea I know I have some major issues. So anyway Im really really starin to hate this guy that my best friend likes and I feel bad but he hates me. I mean if he was to apolagize for what he did I would be like ok and be friendly but noo he has to be an ass about the whole thing. I mean I'll only be nice because I know my friend likes him but I wish she would realize how fkked up hes bein and forget about him. lol I just had to ask my Erin if I was allowed to say ass on here. Ok so anyways lmao now im chokin my my pop. Ok Erin I know you better not be the only person to reply to my posts. Ok Im gonna go feed my neo pet now so later."

I get to see my dad tomorrow yay. Sometimes I wish the people I like I never met cause I seem to fall in love so easy and then I lose em. Its like right now I wanna push my self away from all the people I like cause Ive already lost one that I love and I dont think I can go through loosing another. You know what I mean. Some people I feel I have to do everything they want me to do or I'll lose them and another I feel like whatever I do still isnt enough. I can never win but hey no one ever wins right? So right now I feel like I dont know what im feelin right now. Yea so anyways I feel like going swimmin. ok well I think im gonna go cause I dont feel like typin anymore. Later"

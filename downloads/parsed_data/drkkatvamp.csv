You like spells, herbs, maybe even voodoo-dolls. You like it very much, and probably even have books or found Internet-sites where magic is the topic. You probably mean no harm with this, well perhaps to some. Most people who are aware of your interest mistakes you for a Satan-worshipper. You're missunderstood, but have your friends. You probably are a wiccan or something related and are interested in mother nature, souls and spirits. You prefer the forrest(or park) before the city.

This means that you have a talent for identifying others emotions, often by simply glancing at them. You are EXTREMELY shy and quiet. People sometimes dont notice youre around and seem surprised to find out you even exist in a big class. Youre the often silent, goody two shoes, and few get passed the walls youve built up to stop yourself being hurt, as you no doubt have been in the past. Not everyone understands you, in fact some think that youre a snob or worse because you rarely participate in group activities. Youre extremely sensitive, even the least harsh of words can hurt you. Only your very few, closest friends who have earned your hard-to-get trust know who you really are inside; a sweet, gentle young woman who is lonely and so desperately needing friends to support you. You can get very depressed and not always know why, despite your power of empathy, as it seems to only work for people outside you. Your friends always turn to you when they need advice or comforting, and in some way you need to give that helpit makes you feel better in return to know that youve helped out your friends. Despite your cold, impassive exterior and high, seemingly unbreachable walls, inside you are really a great, intelligent person, full of compassion and love, if only people would dare take a chance and try to get through your tough shell. Never let others get you down, or change you. You are very special the way you areeven if you dont have fifty thousand friends, you are just as, if not more extraordinary than everyone else. Reach for the stars, because I dont doubt youll catch hold of them. <b> Boy/Girl who will sweep you off your feet: </b>  A sweet, shy and romantic man/woman. The kind of guy/woman you know will never, ever hurt you, and will love you for ever. The kind of person who believes in true love, and soul mates. <b> Your stone: </b> Blue Topaz<b> Your power: </b> Healing. Emotionally, physically, or spiritually, you heal people with your words, your actions and presence. Youre the one that the little children are always drawn to, because they know youll never let anything hurt them. <b> Your element: </b>  Clairvoyance (The power to see objects or events that cannot be perceived by the normal five senses.)<b> A quote that applies to you: </b>""True beauty shines from the soul and warms the world with its<i>  kindness, compassion</i> , and <i>  integrity</i>."" <br/>Take this <a target=""quizilla"" style=""color:rgb(0,0,0)"" href=""http://quizilla.com/redirect.php?statsid=17&url=http://www.quizilla.com/users/caz15th/quizzes/What%27s+your+inner+power%3F+%28Girls+only+sorry.+Beautiful+anime+pictures%2C+lengthy+results%29"">quiz</a>!<br/>

You have been through many things that the average person has never even experienced. I am guessing that the event that has made your life so depressing, is drawn out or has been happening for a really long time now. Most likely, you don't even care to take the time to hide it, you actually WANT others to see how depressed you are. But that's ok, cause they should see what it feels like to live a life that is far from perfect... All you have to do to solve this problem, is look deep inside yourself, and find the root of this depression. Then, yank that weed right out through the roots. There is no need to be so unhappy. If you let this continue, it will be harder to solve this problem in the future. The song itself is very beautiful, and has it own air. The sign of beauty in the song is hope, that maybe one day, everything will be ok. But for now, all you can do, is try your best to find the true meaning of this song. Only then will you find the true happiness locked inside...I just want to say thanx to my best friend, Rachel, for some of the awesome pics that are used in my results.

You have no need for make-up or accessories that most others do. In fact you most likely find them a nuisance. You are probably a little tom-boyish in your jeans and tees with a great love for nature. You probably know more about plants and animals than most people and you'd rather spend your times outdoors and in the sun, independent and free. You can be a bit distant with people, preferring the company of animals over people, which isn't always the best thing. You can be kind and sweet, but not many see that side of you as you often have misunderstandings with people. You are very go-with-the-flow sort of person and usually try to avoid fights even if it means changing your opinion or belief. Still, you are you look your best actually without make-up and in casual clothes. Very few can say that.

People can feel secure with you and generally like you.<br/>Take this <a target=""quizilla"" style=""color:rgb(0,0,0)"" href=""http://quizilla.com/redirect.php?statsid=17&url=http://www.quizilla.com/users/PainfulBliss/quizzes/How+is+your+soul%3F+%5Bpics%5D"">quiz</a>!<br/>

"event","Wow guys... just wow. I haven't updated this since 2005 and it's now the second month of 2006. So if you haven't heard I've moved. I've been going to my new school for like 3 weeks and it still sucks. The school is boring, small, and just plain gay. It doesn't have any of my friends except for the two or three I've made at the school. I miss everyone at Gar-Field. I miss chillin' with Marie, Lovejoy, BAM, Elbyshae, Sara sara sara, Sarah, Josh, Dill, Amanda, Betsy, Raven, Ethan, Maurice, Will, and all my other friends from Gar-Field. It's just so retarded that I moved. I have nothing out here and once I get my license and a good paying job I will be down visiting everyone atleast over the weekend.

OH! I can get my permit on Monday Feb. 6th. I won't get it that day but I'll be getting it within a week or so (if I pass the test....) and then I'll have my license and a car and a job in November of this year. So guys, I'll start my weekly visits in November, if I have enough money to pay for the gas. Maybe I'll sleep over at people's houses starting then too. Heh, I might even sneak.... Nevermind. 

So yeah.... Ummm... Mine and Lovejoy's half a year was January 25th. We went to the Marine Corp Ball on the 28th and that was a blast. I actually danced and didn't care what people thought. I can dance like a black chick and it scares me but that's ok. Ask me to see a picture and I'll have it to show as soon as my dad's scanner works. So yeah.... I LOVE ALL MY FRIENDS!!! I WILL ALWAYS BE A GAR-FIELD INDIAN!!!! WOOT WOOT!!!

BAM IMs me with a convo from Lovejoy that is all like, ""Does kat have a bf?"" bam-""no, do you like her"" lovejoy-""yeah"" so yeah... now i've got lovejoy liking me, that isn't necessarily a completely bad thing. I like him... a little I just don't know him all tha twell, I've only hung out with him twice and all but yeah. AND THEN on myspace lovejoy replied to one of my bulletins and it had a choice that said I'd looking for a relationship with you and lovejoy picked that and I'm all like, ""......What have I gotten myself into this time!?!? *sigh*"" So yeah, that has been my week.... I will have an update on the lovejoy stuff laters if anything new happens and I'll have updates of my summer because it is about to get hectic.

You always<br>seem so depressed, lonely, and feel like an<br>outsider. You may have a cold, sad exterior,<br>but in all reality you are hurt inside and<br>bottling up all of your anger. Everyday you<br>wonder why are you still here when there is<br>nothing left? You use to once be a happy,<br>loving soul, but it was damaged by 'them' and<br>seems like it never can be fixed again.<br>However, you have yet seemed to realize that<br>there are people out there that deeply care for<br>you. They secretly have a thing for you because<br>they find you to be dark, mysterious, and full<br>of secrets, not to mention being the prettiest<br>person in the world! You like to enjoy your<br>time by yourself expressing your feelings<br>through forms of art, and enjoy nice quiet<br>scenaries that just dazzle your mind with awe.<br>Your bedroom is basically your sanctuary where<br>you can hide out, hidden from those who gave<br>you all of the pain. Try to loosen up and have<br>some fun! Never start frowning because you<br>never know who's falling in love with your<br>smile :)

You<br>are constantly hurt and depressed... No one<br>seems to understand how you feel because<br>everyone is scared to get close to you... You<br>long to be able to reach out and tell someone<br>everything, and all of your problems... But you<br>have no one to tell, or they just don't seem to<br>want to hear what you have to say. You've been<br>hurt many times that you don't seem to have any<br>tears left to shed, or if you do, they're an<br>endless river flowing... You've started to hide<br>and bottle up all or your problems and<br>feelings, hoping that maybe they just will go<br>away... You want company, but at the same time,<br>you're scared of it. Your sanctuary is your<br>room where you can just be alone and try to<br>throw away all of your aching pains. You're<br>dark and mysterious and people like you for<br>that reason. Even if you think you're all by<br>yourself in the dark, someone is always there<br>with you. Your special someone wants to admit<br>and show their feelings towards you, but<br>they're afraid of how you'll take it. Get out<br>more and enjoy life because, it is far too long<br>to frown your way through :)

You're often depressed and<br>you've been hurt so many times that you tears<br>seem meaningless, if you even have any left to<br>cry! You want to be able to reach out and tell<br>someone everything, making your troubles go<br>away... But... You jsut can't bring yourself to<br>do so... Everyday you wish that all of the pain<br>will just go away... Just disappear... However,<br>it just seems to get worse and you try to<br>bottle everything up inside as best as you can!<br>However, your plan sometimes fails, making you<br>lash out or break down emotionally. You just<br>wish to be like everyone else... You want to be<br>able to tell someone all of your problems...<br>But you're afraid of admitting your weakness...<br>You're that outside, loner, mistunderstood<br>person that has been pushed out of everyones'<br>life. You desperately try to break through the<br>barrier, but you guts tell you no... You'll<br>just be hurt again and again... So why bother?<br>Your sanctuary is your room, where you can hide<br>out and be out of 'their' visions. You like to<br>express your thoughts and feelings through<br>various forms of art, and try ridding of your<br>pain in 'different ways.' You're so busy caught<br>up in your own little, lost world, that you<br>have yet to realize that a light burns inside<br>of the darkness of the pack. You might not know<br>it, but out there... Someone is watching your<br>every move... Enjoying your presence...<br>Enjoying you for who YOU are! Wipe away those<br>tears and open up those beautiful eyes, see the<br>light! See what you're missing and grasp ahold,<br>break out of that crust, and mold... Smile your<br>way through life because the most beautiful<br>things cannot be concealed forever :)

If you see a person trip you<br>worry is he is okay. You put your loved ones<br>first and you're very mature. When someones<br>sick you're nurturing and always try to help<br>family and friends when failure strikes them.<br>You can be called the motherly one, if you are<br>in a group of people, which doesn't have to be<br>bad. Love is something that's already in you<br>and you have a lot to give whether you believe<br>it or not. Your friends probably love you very<br>much and come to when they need help since<br>you're reliable. People can feel secure with<br>you and generally like you.

Hated, sad and often feeling<br>lonely, there is only a few that appreciate the<br>real you. You tend to keep to yourself and away<br>from the world since you don't want to be hurt<br>and betrayed again. Music gives you the<br>understanding you need to get through, it's<br>your ""therapy"". Or you express<br>yourself through art or writing. Chances are<br>you're also an anti-social person, who only<br>likes being with close friends, if even that.<br>The world has finally showed it's true face for<br>you and you wish life wasn't this miserable to<br>live through. Maybe you'll find happiness in<br>the future, but right now you're just hiding<br>away from the world. Who needs people anyway?

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/P/PainfulBliss/1107704158_izsad_word.JPG"" border=""0"" alt=""Sad""><br>Your word is: Sad. You wanted to give yourself to<br>someone. But they didn't accept you. Being<br>rejected, whether it be from family, friends,<br>love-interests or peers, is a very hurtful<br>thing to go through. It is also likely that you<br>have been betrayed several times before, which<br>is why you keep away from everyone now. You<br>learned the hard way to never trust people and<br>your defence-mechanism is now to isolate<br>yourself. Yet you yearn for people who will<br>understand and like you, to have the thing you<br>never had: love.

Happy people confuse you. Alot. I mean,<br>why are they so happy anyway? You are depressed<br>and perhaps utterly alone and live life rather<br>montone.

Two things that I heard that made me laugh were, ""I believe Britney Spears should be one of Baskin Robin's 31 flavors."" and ""I believe that if you show me a 3 year old running around a fela market with his underpants on drinking a coca-cola out of a bottle, I'll show you a future Nascar fan.""

"event","Kays well Betsy's party was tons of fun. I played pool and danced the time warp a couple times. I did the macarana and yeah. I didn't eat anything because I had eaten a huge dinner and didn't feel like eating anything. I laid outside on the sidewalk and stared at the stars. I did learn something last night and yeah. People were saying I looked depressed and if I had wanted to tell the truth, I was. I missed Will and I only missed him because early yesterday I learned that he may not go to Gar-Field next year because he only goes to Gar-Field because of IB and his base school is Potomac. If his grades don't improve (which they have since I started going out with him) his parents will most likely pull him out of IB and he would be going to Potomac and he had told me he had like failed 2-3 tests in Geometry. Him telling me this really hit home that I care about him more then I want to believe I do. I didn't want to believe that I loved him (not like parents love each other but like..... I dunno how to explain) because if I did then I would like.... feel like I was risking my heart again and I didn't want to go through that because knowing me I'd prolly be the one to fuck it up anyways. So yeah, I've realized I do care about him and for some reason I miss him more now then I ever have and its blah. I almost cried last night at Betsy's party, when I was talking to Jimboh after I had come home, and now. It's blah, I don't get to see Will over the weekend either so yeah. I'm goin with Sara to the movies tomorrow so that should be fun. But it's just blah..... neways... I'm gonna go now.

Love ya,
Kat"

"event","Ok so I haven't updated in awhile. So here is the latest from last week. I went to Godwin for some weird faculty against students game thing and that was awesome. I had Shelby sitting on my lap and somehow we ended up holding hands for like a minute. Kathryn was laying on me and using my boobs as a pillow and she said that my boobs are a comfy pillow (don't tell will..... x.x). Lets see..... Me and Sara where trying to steal Kenny's shoes and Emily was sitting there watching... Umm.. Shelby did this weird thing where she put her mouth over my nose and blew and it popped my ears. Hmm... BAM humped me because I was sitting and resting my head on the bleacher and yeah, she thought I was depressed and stuff (I kinda was because I didn't get to hang out with Will). Oh and before all this I was helping Sara with her World History project and before that Michael had come over for ""30"" minutes. He kept saying he would leave cuz Sara was coming over but it took me having to get up and say I'm leaving for him to leave. During all of this Michael wouldn't stop touching my ass but he barely was so I didn't saying anything about it because well.. he would just deny it because he has a girlfriend (tell Will this if you want to, I don't care)

Then Saturday..... hmmm..... On Saturday I..... I woke up at like 1:45 and had to go to Marie's b-day thingy at IHOP at 2 so yeah, I was kinda rushed doing that. That was pretty fun, we talked about Carrie and lots of other random stuff. Then after that I came home and.... and.... ummm..... I don't remember what I did when I came home. But yeah that was Saturday.

On Sunday I had kinda been waiting for Will to call and ask if I wanted to do something but he didn't so I sat around the house and played video games and watched movies and it was gay and very boring.

Monday.... Hmm... Monday.... On Monday Will had to go to the dentist and he hadn't been feeling good and yeah. I ended up getting sick because of him....

Tuesday.... I wasn't feeling all that great because of Will (but it all happened for good reasons ^.^). I stayed after for Mr. Jones's extra credit stuff but I came late because I had to wait on my dad to come bring me my candy money and I made Will late because I made him come with me. I forgot my cellphone in Mr. Burney's room after I finished the stuff with my money and yeah. Amanda asked what me and Will had been doing and yeah, it was some good times. Will and I ended up having our normal argument of him saying I'm beautiful/cute and me disagreeing but I'm giving up on arguing that one because alot of guys say it and my dad even said I act cutesy at times.

On Wednesday I didn't feel any better but I still went to school. I was supposed to go to Mr. Jones's extra credit but I didn't because I wasn't feeling good at all. So yeah, I hung out with Will and my brother came and got me. I had a Venture Crew Open House at 7 and yeah, that was that. It was actually fun at the Venture Crew meeting but that was because we had like the first 45 minutes to goof off and what not so yeah.

Then for today. Today has been an interesting day. I got to school and did my math homework because I fell asleep doing it the night before and I was frickin tired as shit because when I don't feel good I don't sleep very well and yeah. I went to finish the last 3 problems in French and my teacher saw me and took my homework and wouldn't give it back. I was frickin pissed after that and added to the tired it was a blah combination. Then I didn't want to go to math because I didn't have the homework and I'm failing that class but I was saved because my math teacher wasn't there so the homework wasn't marked. So yeah, I had a complicated math class because the stuff we worked on was the stuff we just learned and I didn't have the notes because the notes were on the other side of my math homework (stupid french teacher). So yeah, then I went to English and that was pretty entertaining. After English I met Will, Shelby, and Marie infront of le Boy's Lockerroom and yeah. Shelby started singing ""Have you seen the way they kiss in the movies"" ""isn't it delictable?"" and thats something from a song we are singing in choir class and yeah. It was good times. I got to see my Will which always makes me happy and yeah (life is really good right now because I've sorted out most of my problems for the most part)(Yes my friend penguin helped a great deal with the helping and he prolly doesn't even realize that he did)(what he said to me and everything really hit home and showed me what I was doing wrong and yeah I've still got my little fear of screwing up horribly like I have before but I'll find a way to make that go away). So yeah, that is the really long update of the past week.

"event","So yes, yesterday was a blast AFTER school. I had Sara come over and I helped her with her World History project plus got alot of jokes. PUSSY POWDER!!!!!!! ANYWAYS!! Thats a long story. So today, I almost cried after 1st pd., during 3rd, and after 3rd because of reasons I can't talk about. I almost cried while I was hugging Will and informing him of what was wrong. So yeah, I had Sera tell him I was sorry and had him wait for me after 7th pd. by the Boys Locker Room. So yeah I came home (i had to walk) and played DA til about 5:35 and got Sara. She is at my house right now and we are supposed to be working on her World History project and we will when I finish posting this. Woosh, well I'm done posting now.

"event","Guys, I have now figured out how much of a damn screw up I am. My parents wanted so much for me and I just rebelled and now I've fucked up and I don't think I can fix it this time. In the past I've fucked up but I've always been able to correct it but this time I just didn't care and now I think it's to late to fix it. God why did I have to be so stupid and not care? I thought I was doing the right thing, wanting to be my own person, not wanting to be compared to my eldest brother. Why couldn't I just live with it and continue being smart? Why did I have to fucking care so much if I'm like my older brother or not? Why couldn't I just continue to be the smart me who wanted to do good and had a dream? Why the fuck! Why the fuck! AH!! I'm so fucking stupid. I'm like a massive screw up. I fucking cut myself for pete's sake. If that doesn't show you that I'm a screw up then what will? Anyways... I'm like gonna go break down now.....

"event","So yeah, the past couple days have sucked major ass. I went to sq on Friday and that was some good times. Royalle was supposed to come but she got in trouble and couldn't. BAM was there and Chris P. and Eric and Danny and Lunchbox. It was frickin awesome, we played with green ice (it was the ice from the st. patrick's day stuff). I was really mature and everything and we all found out that there won't be anymore 9-12 public skating sessions at sq on Fridays. If you wanna skate from 9-12 you have to go on Saturdays. So yeah, today I went to Royalle's house and we played DDR. I'm getting better at it but my cordination is still off alittle. I'm getting better letters on that. Then I tried on Royalle's homecoming dress and she got a pic of me in it on my cell so yeah, I've got that. Then she let me borrow her tigger shirt and gave me her tinkerbell shirt. So I'm wearing tinkerbell to school on Monday and tigger tuesday. The tinkerbell shirt says ""star light.... star bright... Where the heck is Mr. Right?"" and the tigger one says ""U gotta luv me"" so yeah. I'll wear girl pants with em so that it looks right because they are girl shirts. So that's an update on my spring break. I hope everyone has an awesome easter.

"event","Ok, so today I babysat Hallie and then went to Marie's grandpas house. That was some good times. We were sitting in a blue room, listening to Shania Twain, talking about toilets, and playing with legs (dont ask). Then we went to Hillendale Park, had her iPod with us and were rockin the hood with our Linkin Park. Yeah we called peoples askin them to come to the park but well..... either they were not home, couldn't come, or eating ::cough:: will ::cough::. So yeah, I was balancing on the teeter-tooter trying to keep it completely even. Then we like... went to a different park and ran with the dog we were walking. Then we went back to her grandpa's house and watched Charmed. Now I'm at home bored outta my mind not to mention I've had an ongoing battle raging in my head since about 5:30. It's driving me fucking insane because I need to make it stop before it depresses me to the point of me doing some stupid shit. Anyways, I'm gonna go now guys.

It was a good movie, not as scary as I had hoped it would be because normally scary movies make it hard for me to sleep and Ring 2 didn't. I almost cried during the movie but thats got nothing to do with anything of great importance. I went with Will and yeah, my papa gave him a ride home. I bought him another necklace from Hot Topic and he feels like I'm turning him goth/punk. That makes me feel bad because I'm not trying to turn him into anything, I love him the way he is. ::sighs:: so yeah, thats yesterday. Today I helped my papa watch Hallie. That was entertaining. I played Kingdom Hearts and yeah.... thats bout it. So yeah, thats been my spring break so far (pretty borin).

"event","Ok so yeah, I've had a pretty good weekend. Friday was mine and Will's 1 month anniversary (yes I do 1 month anniversaries because usually my relationships dont last 1 month (aside from penguin)). So yeah, we went to the mall after school on Friday and hung out. He bought me an ICP shirt from Hot Topic and I bought him a dragon necklace. Mine was like 8 something and his was 20 something. Shows how much I really love him.... he spent like 14 dollars more on me then I did on him. Then we bought tickets to see Robots at 5 with Shelby and Tom. Marie came later when her mom brought her and we hung out at Planet Fun. Will tried to pick me up but I put my force into staying on the ground and then I got depressed because I hate being picked up. And then while I was depressed about that thoughts from my past and what I've done came back and made it worse. I actually almost cried and I had to tell Will it didn't have to do with him because it didn't. Then Shelby said something about the Time Warp from Rocky Horror Picture Show and I wasn't depressed anymore because I love the Time Warp. So yeah we saw the movie and his mom picked us up. His mom said I had no choice in the matter and that I would be eating with them and she took me, will, and shannon (will's little sister) to Subway. I didn't like the fact that I didn't have a say in the matter but I didn't feel like arguing. When I got home I ate and talked to Jimboh and then went to Marlaina's b-day party. That was some fun times man. I was dared to eat  a piece of cake with only my mouth. I had a minute to do it and I did it in like 30 seconds. So yeah, I was like laughing for no reason too and that was..... odd. Then I came home and went to bed because I had a cookie booth on Saturday.

Saturday I went to my cookie booth and sold 12 boxes of cookies. Then I came home and cleaned my room because Will was coming over. So yeah, Will came over and we watched The Grudge (which isnt scary the second time around), played some Kingdom Hearts, and watched Fight Club. Then we went ice skating where we talked about some pretty random stuff lemme tell ya. We also played Time Crisis II. Yeah..... then I came home and slept cuz I had to work Patriot Center on Sunday.

Today I was up by about 4:30 and out of the house by about 5:05. I got to the Patriot Center at about 5:30 and then sat in the car til 6. Then I went inside and sat around til about 6:40 when we were finally able to get into Sub 12 for uniforms. Then I went to Stand 3 to work but I ended up getting switched to frier because they only had 3 people. I burned my arm on the basket when I was trying to dump it because I was actually working the frier. Then I like.... got moved to the ice cream stand for the rest of the night. I like.... sliced my finger trying to clean part of the ice cream machine and that hurts so yeah. That has been my day. I worked for.... over....12 hrs at the Patriot Center today and I was standing almost the whole time. Yep.

OH YEAH!!!!!! HAVE A VERY VERY VERY GOOD SPRING BREAK AND A MERRY EASTER EVERYONE!!!!! I dunno what my plans for the week are but I know they will be fun ^.^"

"event","Ok.... today was..... a little crappy to say the least. Lets see..... this morning was awesome, I got to see Will and what not. Choir wasn't that bad either. Missy and Angela traded shoes after first pd. cuz Missy had PE and she forgot tennis shoes but Angela's shoes were to big so me and Missy traded shoes and I had Angela's. I had a test in math class..... and after I finished the test I got a pass to the bathroom, i got water and went to the bathroom and then got more water..... then I kinda like got Ethan to get Will from the library so I could tell him some stuff about after school. Mr. Nolen walked by and told us to go to where we were supposed to be so we started to finish up talking and then Mr. Nolen went back by and asked where we were supposed to be. I told him math and Will told him lunch so he told us to go. We finished up talking but Mr. Nolen told me to come and so I followed him but first I gave Will a hug and kissed him and Mr. Nolen was like, ""I'm going to write you up."" and I was like, ""No, don't do that Mr. Nolen."" So yeah, he walked me to my math class and as I was throwing my pass away he told Mrs. Simon, ""She was making-out with her boyfriend in the hallway."" and I was like ""I was not!"" and Mrs. Simon was like ""It was a 15 minute trip."" and yeah. That pissed me off and then Will came to my class to give me my shoes from Missy and Mrs. Simon was all like ""So what, did you lose your shoes while making-out."" and I held my tongue like a good little girl. But if I hadn't have wanted to stay out of trouble I would have stood up, told her off, and walked out of the classroom because that fucking pissed me the fuck off. For one she didn't know the story and two she had no fucking right to be a sarcastic bitch like that. But I should be greatful to her because she could have written me up but instead she just called my mom at work and told her that she was concerned about me and what not. I had patriot center directly after school so when I got home at like 9:50 I got a good 25 minute lecture on that and my grades and how I can do better and what not. At some point during the lecture I started crying alittle because my dad just didn't understand what is going on in my life. He doens't understand whats going through my head. What he did understand was that I'm trying to balance Girl Scouts, Patriot Center, School, and Will. He doesn't mind me having a boyfriend, he actually wants me to have one and he doesn't mind me having fun but he says school is first priority. I got my phone taken away and I can't go to the mall tomorrow (Saturday).  That makes me really sad because I had some stuff I needed to buy from Hot Topic but maybe my mom will be nice and let me either go to Will's house or him come to our house.... I did my math homework in the same room as my parent's and even asked my dad questions so that they know I'm doing my homework and so my dad knows exactly what I'm doing and how hard it really is. So yeah.... I'm gonna like go now....

"event","GRARRR!!!! Ok, now that is out of my system. If you didn't notice I'm kinda pissed right now. My dad won't let me go to the movies because the grades he knew were already gonna be crappy are crappy. He knows why too and yet he says I'm not trying hard enough. WTF! I try as hard as I can, it's not my fault I have two fucking choices on how to do in school. I either do like my brother Landon or I do like my brother Eric. How about I do like...oh I don't know.....oh wait..... HOW ABOUT I DO LIKE ME! GOOD LORD! I'm fucking tired of having to be fucking compared to my brothers and having to be like one or the other, I want to be my own damn person already. I may be smart but at some point my dad is gonna learn that I'm not as smart as he thinks and then he'll fucking understand why the fuck I didn't do as good in school as he had wanted.He expects alot from me and then when I don't reach what he expects he lets me know he is dissappointed but he does it without words which is worse because he changes how he acts towards me. I want him to just fucking let do things on my own without being fucking compared to my fucking brothers, I'm not them I'm me. It's got me fucking pissed as fucking shit and GRAR! I already made fucking plans with Will and Jimboh to go to the damn movies and now I can't fucking go. I'm gonna like walk to the mall and go anyways, I've got the money and the ability to walk. So yeah, thats the generalization for now.

"event","OMG OMG OMG!!! TODAY WAS FUCKING AWESOME MAN!!!! So I go to school and its raining and everyting, thats cool and all. I wait for Will by his locker but I got tired of waiting so I left. I sat in the library for less then 5 seconds and the bell rang. I stayed sitting for alittle bit and I was like really sad and everything. I almost cried because I was tired of always being the one to wait for Will so yeah, I was leaving the library and saw Will so I talked to him for alittle bit. He could tell something was wrong but I told him nothing was wrong and he left it alone. So as I'm going to French I see Angela and Ashley so I talk to them... more like sulk and tell them nothing is wrong. At this point there are actually tears in my eyes but I make them go away and go into class. I almost cried again during the minute of silence and was sulky like the whole class. I refused a hug from Mikey D. and got a couple 1-sided hugs from Angela because she was hugging me but I was just standing there. So yeah, I go to World History and I cheer up alittle. Then I go to Biology and that was some good times. Then as we are supposed to be leaving to go to lunch Mr.Dalek comes on the intercom to tell us we are going home early. So yeah thats good times. I met Will at his locker and I walked him to his french class because he was supposed to do something with his teacher. I ended up missing my bus so I go back inside and find Eryn, Andy, and Mikey D. and they are all going to the mall so I decided that I wanted to go to the mall. So I borrowed Eryn's cell and called home. Then I was like ""Will you have to ask if you can go."" So he uses Sam's cell and calls home and gets permission and we go to the mall. We hung out with Eryn, Mikey D., and Andy outside a church as Mikey D. waited for his ride to come get him. Then we walked to the mall and sat in the food court for alittle bit and then headed to planet fun. I had some fun protesting against sitting in the corner with Will but I knew what would happen if we did and not saying I didn't want it I just didn't want to have LOTS of people around so yeah, I watched some people play DDR and Will like stood behind me with his arms around me. Then we went to Spencers with Derek and Nigel and yeah that was pretty fun. Then we called his dad and his dad came and got us. So yeah, thats been my day.

"event","Well, yesterday I worked for over 11 hours at the patriot center for a cheerleading event. It was ok I guess but I'm sickened by some cheerleaders now because the ones that aren't exactly thin wearing those tight clothes with their belly sticking out and stuff. Oh well.... now on to today.

Today was ok I guess. I waited for Will at his locker but he didn't come so I went to class when the bell rang. I saw Will for the only time today after first pd. and found out that he had just gone straight to his class. I had written him a note on saturday but I didn't know if I was going to give it to him. I decided to in 3rd pd. because I asked Shelby and yeah. So I had planned on seeing him at the end of the day but when I got to his locker I remembered that he didn't have a reason to go to his locker so I went to look for him. I didn't go outside though because I had to go back into choir. When I didn't find him I went to choir, put my stuff down, and looked again. So yeah, when I got back to the choir room I was almost in tears because it was really important for me to give him the note because its something he should know and it just upset me that when I had something important to like give or tell him I couldn't find him. So choir got out early and me and shelby hung out. She said the same things I was thinking bout in a relationship communication is key and that I should talk to Will. I really do like him and really like being with him but if I don't learn to be able to tell him when something is wrong and what not it isn't going to work. I have a bad feeling that I'm gonna screw it up and it'll end up breaking my heart and I'll go into this depression where I harm myself physically and mentally and my friend emotionally by my actions. I called Will and talked to him. I told him I had something to give him and asked if he would be able to go to the mall on Saturday. He most likely can but what I've noticed is that I'm the one meeting and waiting for him and making plans with him. He doesn't meet me anywhere, or wait for me anywhere, or make plans to go out with me. I'm the one doing it and its just weird.... So yeah, thats been today so far."

"event","Ok, so last night was pretty fun. I went ice skating with Royalle and Will and I was like mobbed by alot of my friends that just showed up there. Bam was there, Kenny, Alea, Danielle, ummm....... :name blank:. Yeah.. not as many as I remember but there were alot of people that I knew there. Will found out how far I've gone and almost found out about me being really weird with my friends and that involves hotdogs.... lets see.... I found out some stuff from Will that I didn't wanna know but thats cool too. Ummm.... I got really depressed like twice..... or three times..... but that had to do with something that I have done that I really regret. If you want to know bout this just ask and I'll prolly tell ya but it's not somethin I like talkin bout.... makes me depressed because I dun think what happened is right to be done by anyone to someone else. Anyways! I had lots of fun hangin out with Will and Royalle. So yeah... me and Will had some odd conversations. At one point we were talkin bout how we had like french kissed 2 days after we started going out. I told Will I had figured he'd be a slow, nervous kid but I had been wrong about that. I had told him that I had planned on letting him do stuff in his own time.... Then at one point we were skating and I was calling him a showoff and then we started talking bout he was annoying and talked ALOT in 8th grade and that now, in 9th grade, people don't realize he is in there class because he is quiet and reads or sleeps or is working. I called him a nerd and he was like, ""If you like nerds I'll be a nerd."" and I was like ""No, I don't like any particular type."" So yeah, then he said that a nerd to him was people playing yu-gi-oh at lunch and what not and I was like ""Hey! I take offense to that. I still play that game."" And he said he did too and went on to describe his deck and how he plays it and what not. It was really weird.... but it was all good man. Now for the part that is really weird. When we had taken our skates off and were getting ready to leave me and Will were kissin/makin out (sorta) and when we stopped and started walking to go outside (after I saw my brother standing at the door) my stomach hurt like crap. It hadn't hurt til I had kissed Will and yeah, it never did that before when I kissed him. It was really weird... so yeah, that was my friday night. Jimboh called my cell twice but thats cool.

Love ya,
Kat

P.S. OH YEAH!!!! I slept really good last night. No problems falling asleep or anything. I think I figured out what was wrong and now I'm gonna try and fix it. No more insomnia! WHEE! :does a happy dance:"

I'm gonna be going ice skating here in bout 30 minutes with Royalle, Will, Kenny, BAM, Alea... umm... thats all that I know of.

"event","Grar! It's frickin 12:12 in the morning (as in 12 minutes after midnight) and I CAN'T SLEEP!!!!!! I'M FUCKING TIRED OF THIS SHIT MAN!!! I KNOW I SHOULD BE ASLEEP BY NOW BUT NOOOOOO I CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE I HAVE SOME FUCKING PROBLEMS OR SOMETHING. (yes, i am pissed about this. its not good that i can't sleep because it only happens when i'm really worried about something or something is just plain wrong in my life and i don't know what yet) I don't know why the hell I can't sleep but I know it has to do with something that is wrong and I don't know what yet. I'm not really worried about anything other then what I'm always worried about. I think I'm supposed to like do something and I just don't know what. My thoughts before sleep try and tell me but I just can't remember them when I wake up to know and then my dreams are like.... wah stupid and I just don't know anymore. I give up, thats all there is to it. I give up on ever figuring out what the fuck is wrong with me because I know something is fucking wrong."

"event","Ok so today started out really bad cuz I haven't been sleeping well lately but thats ok, I'll get that solved. French was...... enjoyable I suppose, choir was interesting.... i suppose, math was horrible because I can't stand the class anymore, and english was kick ass fun. I didn't want to go to math class but I did because I dun need to get in more trouble and when I was supposed to be going to 7th pd. I zoned out and thought I was going to 6th pd. I was standing in the lobby when I realized and was like ""What the fuck am I doing? What the hell am I here for."" And my friend Ian walked up and it was just weird cuz I didn't even notice him walking up and yeah, I walked to my english class. I got my two detentions changed from the 14th and 15th to the 16th and 17th which is ok, I really wanted to get them changed to ISS but oh well, I'll live. I got Mikey D. to give Will a hug and Will didn't like it. So afterschool when me and Will were walkin I saw Mikey D. and was all like yay! and everything and Will was like ""if you try and get him to hug me again I will run."" So I was trying to get Mikey D. to hug him without me actually saying outloud and Mike was going to and Will kinda moved away but he couldn't run. I was like ""You can't run if I'm holding your hand."" and he was like ""Yes I can."" And I was thinking ""yeah, uh-huh. You wouldn't though because that would make me sad."" But I didn't say that outloud or anything. So yeah, after that Christine was like taking a paperclip thing to make back and it tickled like crazy so I was hiding behind Will and she was doing it while we were walkin to out buses and it was bad times. So yeah..... that was school today.

Now for yesterday. Yesterday was ..... stupid as fuck..... I went to my classes okie day. I go to second period and I get a pass that says go see Mrs.Nash and I'm like fuck! So yeah, I got detention for skipping 5th pd. last wednesday, thats ok though.... then yeah, the other classes were gay. I almost cried in Biology and again during lunch. I kinda did cry like for 5 seconds in gym but then my friends came and I acted like my eyes were just watering because well. I told Will that I love him right before 2nd pd. and I had felt bad because I had thought it was too soon to say stuff like that (I still do...) so yeah, it made me sad. I tried to act like I was fine but it didn't work to well. So yeah.... then on the way to girl scouts my dad and I had a ""discussion"" in which he ""talked"" to me about algebra 2/trig. He knows its hard but says that I can do it and I'm like no, I can't. I've tried and I still do bad. I had started to cry in the car but stopped so that no one at scouts would be able to see bloodshot eyes and everything. So yeah, he doesn't get the fact that I may not be as smart as he thought I was and he just keeps pushing me. Whenever I fail to meet his expectations he lets me know even if he doesn't directly say anything. That is what just pushes me over the edge because its like he wants to live through me and I dun want that. I know he wants me to do as best as I can but sometimes he needs to just understand that all the stuff I'm doing and all the worries I have that he doesn't know about get overwhelming at times. He also said that he knew enough about what was going on to know that I'm not trying my hardest. He doesn't know the half of it but he is right that I'm not trying my hardest. So yeah.... thats yesterday.

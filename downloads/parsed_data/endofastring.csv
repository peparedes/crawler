She liked to think that one day she would head off for distant shores. She would learn about the world -- not the way tourists do, although of course she'd see the Louvre and the Pyramids and maybe make a silent, solemn visit to Buchenwald -- but by living there, in that <i>elsewhere,</i> for a month or a year or however long it took to understand something.

She would go to South Africa and see if Apartheid had ever really been lifted. She would go to Germany and see the difference between a little farming village and the bustle of Cologne, where she would have to guard her pockets against thieves even in the cathedral. She would work backstage in the West End.

Not today. Today she sat on the couch with a bowl of macaroni and cheese and a geography textbook studying maps. <i>Someday, though,</i> she thought, and drew a red circle around Pretoria."

<lj-cut text= ""Prompt: No one needs to know."">
They've been over for a while, but on bad days she still calls and asks to come over. They watch bad movies and eat frozen cookie dough out of the tube. She still lays her head in his lap, and he runs his fingers through her hair, which is frizzy lately from the wet winter but still feels soft.

Every so often she'll admit that she still misses him, and he says he misses her too. Then they hurry to agree that even so, it's better this way, that going back now wouldn't change anything. They are quiet a while, and then he starts making fun of the movie's dialogue to distract them both from thinking about it, and she laughs even though her eyes are wet and her throat is trying to close up. He doesn't say anything when he notices, but makes her sit up so he can massage her back, as if the hurting could be rubbed out like the tension she always carries in her neck and shoulders.

She still spends the night, although now she sleeps in the guest bedroom downstairs. He kisses her goodnight -- on the forehead instead of the lips now.

Maybe the boundaries aren't drawn as thick and solid as they should be (pencil instead of ink.) Maybe they're too close. Maybe if she saw them his girlfriend wouldn't like it, even though they're so, so careful not to let their touches stray anywhere they oughtn't, even though at parties when she is not there they are careful not to drink too much for fear they will forget and crawl into bed together.

Maybe they are still a little bit in love.

But it's okay.

No one needs to know.</lj-cut>

. . . The subject matter of my writing is all a wee bit too similar lately. :/ Oh well. They say to write what you know, right?"

<i>Take an emotion, any emotion (ex: anger, sadness, happiness, lust, jealousy), and turn it into a fictional character. What you do with that character is up to you.</I>

<lj-cut text= ""Love."">She liked him sincerely, even the bad things about him, because they were him. Said it didn't matter that he was stupid sometimes because it was a kind of stupid she understood. Mostly, though, she saw the good. She believed in it. When he stopped teasing and spoke seriously, she would smile even wider, glad to hear what was in his head.

When she got angry, which was rarely, it was almost frightening -- the sort of bright, flashing anger that didn't know quite where it had come from or where it was going and was furious because of it. But later she would apologize even if it was his fault, not hers. She would try to understand, and then she'd say, ""You're still wrong, but I get why you think so. I'm sorry I yelled. That wasn't fair.""

She would come over even if she didn't want to see him and twine her body with his, trying to close the distance which hurt them both so much. She would press her face into his shoulder and when she was done crying she would laugh at his stupid jokes and kiss him, glad to be close again. She was always glad to see him, even when she was angry. Even when she was hurt.

When she was pleased to see him she would kiss him without reason. She would let him touch her face and she'd like it, even though she said a thousand times hands on her face make her skin crawl. She would fall asleep holding his hand.

Every time he sees her he remembers.

He's a little afraid of not being loved like that again.</lj-cut>"

- I was too afraid to speak up. All I could do was curl close and take your hand in mine and hope you understood.

- I couldn't stop laughing. ""What's so funny?"" you asked. It isn't funny, I was thinking. It's just wonderful. But I couldn't stop laughing, and if I could have the words would have scrambled out of reach. All I could do was laugh some more and kiss you.

- Winter chill and anger and hurt made my breath catch in my throat. ""No, I'm fine,"" I said, and it was all I could do to keep my voice steady. ""Cold and drunk and tired, that's all.""

- ""Oh. Well, if that's what you want, I guess that's -- that's what you should do."" It was all I could do to keep from arguing.

""Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. Are we okay?""

""Yeah. Yeah, sure, of course we are.""

And I hung up the phone before it slipped from my shaking fingers.

- It was all I could do to keep from twining myself into your arms, burying my face in your chest and staying there until the ache faded away. I propped my head on my knees instead, wrapped my arms tight around my legs and thanked god my eyes were dry. Then you hugged me and I dissolved, love and laughter and anger and pain all uncontained.

There was nothing I could do, and I was glad.</lj-cut>

She went North seeking silence.

In the city she fell asleep to traffic sounds. She woke in the odd hours of the morning to hear college students stumbling home drunk, dropping their keys in the hallway outside their apartments. She lay in a haze until her alarm went off, insisting it was time to force herself out of bed and get to work.

In the city her days were filled with traffic sounds and shouting and laughter from the street below. She scribbled down snatches of conversation, but they never looked as interesting on paper, so she threw them away. The phone rang, again and again -- old friends wanting to catch up mother wanting her to find a boyfriend father wanting her to find a real job publisher wanting her to finish the book.

She drove away heading North one day, adding hers to all the traffic sounds. It would be quiet in the wilderness. There would be silence, and she could write.

The first night she fell asleep to the sounds of owls. She woke in the odd hours of the morning to a banging crashing fearsome noise, and lay in bed with her eyes shut tight hoping it was nothing horrible. When the squabbling of birds made it clear she would never fall back asleep, she went outside to find her trash can overturned, probably by some animal in the night.

There was no such thing as silence. That night she packed to the sounds of owls. In the odd hours of the morning, she drove back South towards the city. The traffic sounds made her feel welcome.</lj-cut>"

"event","Still no NaNo idea, but here's a bit of random writing from a couple of days ago. It probably can't be expanded, and it ends rather abrubtly, but we'll see.

<lj-cut text= ""231 words of something-or-other"">

	He looks relaxed even driving eighty miles an hour, his seat leaned so far back he is practically lying down. A bandanna hides all but a few strands of pale blond hair, and an herbal cigarette dangles from one corner of his mouth.

	He takes it in hand, releasing a long breath, and lets the thick smoke trail out the window. Cold air blows in, tangling Eva's hair and making her breath come haltingly, shallowly. She slouches down in her seat a little, pulling her coat close around her. Her gloves are the cheap kind your parents buy you as a kid because you'd lose the good ones, thin knit things that do nothing at all to warm your hands. She's seventeen now, andshe still loses all the good ones, and in a day or two she'll probably lose these, too.

	It hasn't snowed yet, but the leaves are all gone, leaving trees with silhouettes like scarecrows. The grass is green yet, but faded, drab, sharp with frost.

	There is a feeling all through autumn and winter like you can't quite catch your breath. There is a wetness in your lungs, though your lips grow dry, and crack, and bleed. The shortening days fill you with dread, like before the month is out you'll have only an instant of sunlight-- a light like a wink-- and then not even that. </lj-cut>"

	 The serving girl is wide eyed as she ties the noose and knots the rope to the rafter. The queen would send her away, do it herself, seeing the girl tremble so,  but she cannot because there is blood on her hands and they are too slippery to manage the rope. The girl washes them for her, gently, with a cloth and perfumed water. The queen watches and seems placated and even smiles. She has been scrubbing them for so long, clawing at caked-on blood, and with no result. It stains the water, dark and foul-smelling, but at least she can see her own skin now. When the blood is gone, the girl dries her hands for her, gently, gently, hands shaking still, and curtsies, and hovers waiting to be dismissed. The queen looks at her own white hands. She rubs them together, loving the new <i>cleanness,</i> and tells the girl to go.

	She stands then, and climbs onto the stool, and is satisfied when the rope doesn't slip in her hands anymore. She's already killed a king. Now she will kill a queen, and this time there will be no blood.

"event","I've decided to try to write at least a little every day in preparation for NaNo-ing, and to hopefully write things that will contribute to my actually having some idea of what I'm doing, come November, so here's the result of today's efforts. Actually, I wrote three pages, but 2 1/2 of them sucked. And this . . . I don't know what this is, but it sucks <i>marginally</i> less, anyhow. These characters probably are getting tossed, and I probably don't want to write about theatrical people (I have enough trouble <i>being</i> one, I don't need to have new fictional ones living in my head) but at least I wrote <i>something.</i>

<lj-cut text= ""343 utterly random words"">

	Actors, Emily thinks, live in a heightened reality.

	Ilse is sprawled dramatically across the overstuffed chair, skirt creeping up above her argyle knee-highs. Her hair is carefully tousled, and she observes the world from beneath lowered lashes, head cocked at just the right angle to shadow her eyes. She looks like a photograph, a head shot of herself.

	It isn't that they aren't <i>themselves,</i> Emily thinks. They're more themselves than <i>real</i> people. This is Ilse, all the fluttering-hands indecision and ""ums"" and ""wells"" cut away to make a defined characterization. Directors, Emily thinks, are always pushing actors further. ""It's down here-- it needs to be up <i>here.</i>"" Actors get used to living <i>up here.</i>

	Even now, Ilse's exhaustion is exaggerated. It's not quite real, or it's realer-than-real, and despite all her lazy glamour her lips are bitten beneath her glossy red lipstick, and her sleepy eyes keep sparking with some bright thought she can't quite hide. Still, her legs are stretched further out on the footrest than seems natural, although of course it <i>always</i> seems natural with her. People aren't clean-cut like Ilse, Emily thinks. They aren't precise even in their ambiguities, decisively indecisive, or firmly meek, like Ilse is-- if Ilse is ever meek.

	It must be exhausting, living like that. Emily thinks of the loveliness of listlessness, of how purely wonderful it is to be diffused, unsure, unimportant and undecided from time to time. To not know <i>how</i> it is you feel. She is relieved not to be constantly the essence of a person. She is relieved that when she crosses her arms and legs she is not sitting in a ""closed"" posture, only sitting, and that she is not wearing black to match her state of mind-- her mood today is, if anything, tangerine. She likes wearing her long hair neatly tied back, and not having it fall strategically over one eye. It must be so tiring being as intensely mellow as Ilse.

	When Ilse drifts off into a sleep that does not look at all restful, Emily opens a book and is glad to have no audience.</lj-cut>

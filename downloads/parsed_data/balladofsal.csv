"event","Well summer is pretty much done. And it wasnt all that great. I mean it had it's ups but most of it was just meaningless. I started getting into art again and I'm actually really excited about it. But otherwise its just been empty. I noticed its not the same doing things with a girl if I don't have actual feelings for them. I just wish that I could have something with someone like I had earlier this year. I mean granted that I don't really have feelings for that person anymore I liked the relationship and I just wish I could have something like it again. But it is a Wednesday night so I think I am gonna go do something else instead of complaining on lj."

"event","Last night was really random but in a good way.
I saw someone that I hadn't seen or talked to in a long time.
And I think we are friends now? I ain't sure on that one yet.
But then I hung out with Mark which was cool and that was pretty much whats been going on."

"event","List 5 reasons why you are a dork. And make them good reasons. Justify them. Explain them. Be proud of it. Then pick 5 friends/dorks you know and have them do the same.

1) I still sleep in my sheets and blankets from when I was a little kid. The only thing about this that makes me a dork is that they are mickey mouse sheets and blankets but the are SO soft and awesome. And I also sleep with my stuffed bunny from when I was a child.

2) I taught myself the whole Napoleon Dynamite dance. It seemed like a good idea at the time until the move got really popular which made it really lame. But if you ask me to do it and I like you enough Ill do it for you.

3) I have all of the original Power Ranger episodes on tape and I watch them occasionally. And by occasionally I mean all the time. I like when the monsters get all big and there is a big Godzilla type fight.

4) I had cornrows and I am going to grow another large jew fro except I am catholic so it would be more like a christ fro except I do not believe in catholasism so I guess I am just a white boy with curly hair. But the point is I want to be black. 

5) The last reason I am a dork is because at the moment these songs are on my playlist on itunes 
Eamon - Fuck It(don't want you back)
Hanson - Where's The Love
Sisqo - The Thong Song
  and the two normal songs
Stephen Malkmus and The Jicks - Time For The Gravity Bong
The '89 Cubs - Oh, The Things We Put In Our Heads

Now I have to ask Gary, Sam, Koon, Juliana, and Cheryl to do the same as me and say why you are a dork"

"event","Today was so great

I woke up around 10:30 and played some super mario world on my Super Nintendo

Then I ate some leftover mac n cheese and watched entourage (Best show ever, quite possibly better than the OC)

Then I went skating with Gary and I met this guy Nick who was pretty awesome he showed us some great spots to skate in rockville. I really want to go back to this one brick bank, it was SO nice

And I am making this poster for some show that Gary is going to, I can't wait I love drawing things for other people"

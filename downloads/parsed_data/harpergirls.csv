I've spent time soul searching, been through a WHOLE lot of shit... and about 5 months ago, I met some new folks online... 3 months ago, I lost one of them that I thought was wonderful and he turned out to be an ass.  At that time I turned to a new friend and a month later we started talking on the phone.

It's been 2 months now and I cannot possibly fathom my life without him.  He knows every little bit of me.  My past, present, and goals for the future.  We are connected somehow and it is so awesome.

He lives in Louisiana, so far from here, but someplace I would move to just to be nearer to him...  

He has helped me through so much, including my nightmares that never seemed to leave me until the night he sat on the phone and listened to me sleep, waking me when he'd hear my tears.  

We have talked everyday but 1 in the last 2 months and it is so amazing!  We can sit on the phone for 20 out of 24 hours of the day and NEVER tire of hearing eachother's voices.

I truly would do anything for this man, and I believe him when he says he'd die for me.  Nothing could ever change the way I feel for him, and the fact he accepts Maggie as me, and views us as one is enough to melt my heart.

I want to spend forever loving this man.

Brandon, I love you so goddamned much, it's unfuckingbelievable!

*Kissiez*
Me.

I'm longing for your touch
Just to hold your hand
To look you in your eyes
And help you understand

You have really changed my life
And deeply touched my heart
There are so many things that I want to say
But I don't know where to start

You ALWAYS seem to amaze me
The way you're always there
You speak the kindest words
I can tell that you truly care

Every time we speak
You ALWAYS make me smile
For my life, I am truly thankful
Because you've made it worth the while"

(and it's been a pattern I've retained from the last week or two)

I sit down to check my email, only to hear a cat in the kitchen... he's prowling for my cupcakes I made for a birthday party tomorrow.  I hollar at him, with little or no response from this very ballsy cat.

So, I walk into the kitchen, pull out the foil... cat jumps down, scared I'm gonna beat his ass... and he lands on my toe with his sharp ass back claws!  (If you have cats, you know what I'm talkin about....)

So, gashed open toe... calls for first aid, right?

Apply medicine.  Burns like hell.

"event","I cannot believe it is 4:30 am and I am still awake.  

My neighbors are so screwed up and it's really upsetting me.  I don't know what else to do about it, but if it comes down to it, I'm not afraid to call the police.  It appears as though they are not only fighting Pit Bulls for the hell of it, but they deal drugs out of their house, too.  I am so scared to death that one of their dogs is going to get loose or one of their visiting thugs is going to lose control.  I do NOT need to have this shit around my 8 month old daughter!

So, tonight, I actually put in a call to the rental agent that got me this place before it sold to the new owners.  She has a couple of options for me and it will mean a bit of a change for us.  One option is still SE Portland, but is closer to my mom and closer to the mall!  YAY!  The other option is actually a SW address, but appears to be very near downtown.  I am not so sure that is where I'd like to be.  It's far from family and traffic has got to suck down there!

The one closer to mom is a bit more expensive than where I am now, but a much better neighborhood, and right now peace of mind and a safe environment are more important to me.

I haven't heard from Erin lately, and it really doesn't upset me.  I had the suckiest birthday ever last week, but got over it quickly.  I am moving onward and upward and it feels pretty damn good!

I'm tired of feeling like I need to fit my life into someone's predetermined mold.  I have set out to make my place and fit where I WANT to be.

School is actually pretty awesome.  More so than I thought the first couple of days.  I am only taking a couple of classes, but it is going well.  I've also looked into a couple part time jobs, but am thinking it isn't that great of an idea right now.  I spend about as much time away from Maggie as I can stand right now, being in school and all.  Perhaps when she is a bit older I can venture out.  Right now, though, we are living comfortably and money isn't an issue, so there is no hurry.

Even my horoscopes have been great lately and some are even coming true.  I don't want to get my hopes so far up that it hurts when they fall, but I actually think that I'm heading in that positive direction that I've been searching for!

I should probably get to bed now.  I've tried twice already, but perhaps I am exhausted just enough to make it work this time.  Have a Happy Easter all!  And if you don't celebrate Easter, go celebrate Spring!  (Especially in Portland.  We are supposed to have record breaking temperatures, and it's been so beautiful lately!)"

As my previous post said, I went to lunch with my mom.  I paid for myself, and not once today did I hear the words Happy Birthday.  No friends, no family... not even my mother, the woman who gave birth to me for Christ's sake!

I did get a belated birthday via an MSN message from a friend.  It made me smile.  Which is a good thing, considering earlier today the big baby inside me made me cry when I wasn't able to see them.

My bestest friend, from as far back as I could remember, is still in California, and we have NEVER missed eachother's birthdays... but, no word from her today either.

My dad called me.... about a COMPUTER PROBLEM!!!  No mention of my birthday.

I might seem selfish, but shit.... I go out of my way to make Christmas and Birthdays special for those I care about... is it too much to ask that I at least get acknowledgment of my existence??  Perhaps...

I'm beginning to wonder if I am really here.... do I have the right day???  Good grief!  I must really suck!

"event","Ugh... One illness disappears, another enters!  Maggie is feeling much better now, but I'm getting a sore throat.  Took some zinc to help me, but eww that stuff is nasty tasting!

Went shopping yesterday and started a layaway with a TON of spring/summer clothes, socks, and shoes for Maggie.  She should be all set.  

Our plans for the Markee Dragon get together are all in place, at least I think so.  I am so excited!  It means getting to see some people, 1 in particular, who I haven't seen since last June, and who will be seeing Maggie for the first time!  The one I miss most has been pretty distant online, too, but he has been around recently.  He wasn't sure how to handle Kent's death, so he kind of closed himself off from our online world.  I can't wait to see him - he's so cool.

My aunt is feeling better.  They think it was a virus, but also are open to the possibility of a vertigo type situation.  Because she is deaf, her non-hearing ears tend to cause her some dizziness and imbalance issues.  Hopefully it was just a virus and has passed for good.

After the doctor freaked about my high blood sugars, and put me back on insulin, they have dropped considerably, and actually have been so low recently that I've had to drink juice or eat candy.  I think I need to head back to the endocrine clinic and figure out if I really need all this crap.  I think I can just go back to controlling it by diet, and seriously think my doctor was just crazy.  I had no symptoms of it after delivering Maggie, and only had high sugars when I got really sick.  I feel worse when it drops so low!

Anyway... so Miss Maggie is now 7 1/2 months old and is SOOO funny.  She's such a smartie pants, too.  She was preemie, but she isn't letting it stop her too much.  She sits up on her own, and tries to scoot on the floor, but is such a girlie girl, she HATES it!  She cries if she's on her belly, and would much rather be walking w/ you holding her hands or she's liking standing up at the chair or table.

I was putting her tennis shoes on yesterday and after getting the first one on, she grabbed her other foot and pointed w/ her little pointy finger to tell me where the next one went.  Today she tried to put her own sock on.. didn't really work, and it ended up in her mouth, but she had the right idea at first.  There, the sock dangled from her big toe until she decided it made a better snack!

She is saying mama, dada (to Kent's picture), hi, robbie, gramma, and hola.  She waves good bye and smacks kissiez at ya!  She's also really into facial body parts.  Like... her bunny... when I say where's his nose?  She points (again w/ the sweet little pointy finger) at the bunny's nose.  Same with the eyes, mouth, and bow on his neck.  She's started putting her finger on my nose, too :)

Anyway.. as for life... it continues to go on.  Many of my goals are getting reached, or I'm at least approaching points closer to completion.  My friendships are mending and some are better left broken.  I'm feeling rather tired lately, though, and I love Maggie to death, but really could use a break.  I'm hoping my mom will take her overnight one day this week so I can just have a night for myself.  

Maggie is such a mommy's girl now, that it's hard for me to get anything done.  Hell, I'd even pay just to have someone take her for a few hours so I can actually do all the housecleaning at one time instead of one thing here and another there.  It really gets to be even more tiring because it feels like I'm spending days and days doing tasks that should take only very little time.

Anyway.. everything else seems good.  I had a wonderful time online last night with a good friend, and talked to them on the phone today, which actually made a rather dark, cloudy, rainy day turn into one that was much brighter!  Thanks Oompa! :P"

"event","Well, I woke up to a nice bright sunny day and dressed Maggie in a spring dress and bloomers.  She has the cutest legs, I love it when she can wear a dress! She wore her new purple sandals too.  She knew she was dressed up and seemed to have a great mood to go along with the great weather.

Unfortunately, she had a doctor's appointment ahead of her, and realized it as soon as we stepped foot through the doors.  She immediately cried.  I felt awful.  She's been poked and prodded so much for such a young baby.

Anyway, she is doing well.  The doctor doesn't like her cough, but we were able to give back the monitor and had to keep the nebulizer.  One more week and then another checkup.  My mom will have to take her next Monday because I start school.

Other than the cough, she seems a lot better and the doctor was pleased.  I am so relieved.

The rest of the day seemed as though it was going to be terrific!  It was nice and warm out, we even had my grandma's doors and windows open for fresh air.  It was great.

Then my aunt, who is deaf, came home from work.  (She is on SSDI, but is working part time as a ""housekeeper"" for a care facility)  She said she felt kind of dizzy and was really sore in her shoulders and arms.  Then she said her arms were tingly and one felt asleep.  She drank some water and said it felt a little better, but then said she was going to go take a nap.  She lives next door to my grandmother, but Grandma was still worried.

At around 8pm, the phone rang at my grandma's.  Usually my aunt will use the relay service, but she talked as best she could into the phone and said ""Robbie Come"".  Robbie is my uncle who lives on the other side of my grandma.  He ran across the yards and walked in to find my aunt lying on the floor.  She said she passed out and woke up there.  She had hit her head on the hard wood floor, hurt her back, threw up and accidentally wet her pants.

My other aunt has anxiety attacks, and I have passed out and had seizures several times.  We've never experienced tingling or numbness, and neither of us experienced loss of bodily function control.  

My aunt could barely get herself up and my uncle had to assist her.  She changed into different pants and they took her into the ER at about 8:15.  Can you believe it is now 11:40 pm and she STILL has not seen a doctor???!!

Anyway... another thing to worry about... I hope she is okay.  She has three sons, 1 is married, 1 engaged, and 1 is dating a girl.  The one who is married is expecting a baby in September, the engaged one has a 19 month old son, and the dating one has an almost 5 year old boy.  I just hope that they don't have to experience anything bad with her being sick.

Ugh..."

"event","Seems that no matter what I do in life or what choices I make, I can't ever win.  So, I have given up trying to please others and am only doing for myself and Maggie from now on.

I hate having to take that ""I don't care"" kind of attitude, but that's what it's become and I'm going with it.

I'm tired of feeling like the people in my life are those ""fair weather"" kind of friends.  There are my TRUE friends who show it everyday in their actions and words, and then there are those that care while you are doing something for them, and don't give a fuck the rest of the time.  I'm so done with that kind of bullshit.

With Maggie being sick this last couple weeks, I've really opened my eyes; Especially this past week where her illness brought the world of hospitals and blood draws to the table.  She's feeling much better now and I know what I have to do to make the rest of our days, as a family, good ones.

I'm no longer putting myself last.  I'm not going out of my way to offer assistance or services to people who really need to be finding solutions elsewhere.  I have re-organized my list of priorities and my friends and acquaintances are no longer above me.

Maggie comes first and foremost in my life.  I cannot possibly fathom what made me start to put her needs aside or sacrifice our time together in order to do favors for others.  My #2 on my priorities list is myself.  If I can't take care of myself, how can I manage to take care of my #1 ??

My family comes next and then my true friends.  My other friends and acquaintances are after that.

I have a new list of goals and am working on them slowly, but surely.  One day and one step at a time.  I'm starting back to school next week and am planning to spend this week preparing for that.  I need to organize the schedule and plan with my mom, who will be providing Maggie's childcare while I attend class. I originally signed up for only 2 classes, but last night made a decision to add 2 more if I can still get into them.  I have already talked with the instructors who were eager to get me into their classes, so it should be okay.

For a while, I wasn't too willing to keep close bonds with those I was acquainted with through Kent.  Now, after some true awakenings on my part, I am getting closer with some people and rebuilding true friendships that I never should have let crumble after his passing.  It feels good.

Erin's job is going well, but she found out that they will only need her until the end of summer.  She says she will return to Portland then, but I'm actually not in a rush to get her back here.  Yeah, I miss her a lot, but the distance has made our relationship a little more real.  Before, we were so close, almost too close, and now we are able to examine our relationship and ourselves from a distance.  If she comes back, that's great.  For now, we are both learning and growing and I think that feels good, too.

Some other friends have turned their backs on me for different and various reasons.  A couple of girls are very distant because I am now a mommy.  That's fine.  I'd rather hang out with Maggie than a couple of barflies any day!

A special friend has seemed very distant lately, and he may have reasons for it, but he keeps everything so tightly clenched and bottled up, that I just don't have the strength to pry anymore.  If he wants to talk to me, he will.  If he doesn't, it's his loss.  I've offered so much and done a lot for him, and it felt so right.  I loved knowing that I was helping a friend.  Normally, a friend would say thank you or at least keep contact.  Instead, he needed reminders for the thank yous and his contact became less and less and far between, and mainly about other favors.  That felt really shitty.

What's worse, is that up until this past week with Maggie, I would have done anything for him.  I would have bent over backwards and offered him anything he needed or requested of me and asked nothing of him in return.  I'm done apologizing.  I'm done trying so hard to be there for him.  If he needs me, he'll tell me.  But it's going to be very hard for me because of how far away he's pushed me.  Distance between friends truly sucks.

So, as life goes on, I miss old friends, but welcome new ones with open arms.  I long for a certainty in my relationships, but am learning to settle for all that is so uncertain in life.  I'm making goals and reaching them while I raise the bar for next time.  I'm concentrating on a good life and raising my daughter alone, but with more love than two parents could offer.

I'm learning to balance the bad with the good and am hoping to tip the scale in the latter direction.  Things are looking up as I become more and more independent and less and less confused about where I'm heading."

"event","I realize that sitting here feeling sorry for myself would be totally lame, so I'm trying my hardest to snap out of it.

I just feel that I have no control over anything anymore, and life is getting harder and harder to handle on my own.  It's almost as if Kent's death is only now really starting to sink in and truly affect me.

I totally volunteered to babysit for a friend of mine.  I would do anything on earth to help them out and it feels like I am the biggest failure of a friend and promise maker that I should just be slapped.  I babysat like 1 1/2 weeks total... if you add up the days...  I originally had only a couple days I wasn't going to be available and they had to get them covered.  Then one of the girls I babysit got sick, so they let me stay home to keep Maggie from getting sick.

Didn't work... Maggie and I both ended up sick.  Just as things start to get back to normal and I'm ready to head back to helping them out... Maggie falls ill again.

I feel absolutely horrible.  I feel like I owe it to my friend to keep my promise and stick to what I have agreed to do.  At the same time, I feel awful about wanting to do something for someone else that will take from the 100% that I should be giving to my daughter.

Being a single parent sucks.  And I'm sure there are thousands of single parents who would tell me to stop my whining.  There are many people having to do the same thing as I am doing... raising a baby (or more children) on their own.  I know, I should get over it.

My cousins are single parents and tell me how hard it is for them, too.  Thing is... they chose to live that way.  They chose to have kids without marriage and one actually chose to have a baby without a partner at all. (Don't ask... lol)  My issue is that I got married, was married 4 years before having our child.  I had no intentions of doing this on my own and it almost makes me feel anger toward Kent for leaving us.  I know that's wrong, it isn't his fault.  Perhaps part of the grieving process???

There's just so much I need and want to do, and am afraid I can't do it on my own.  I also want to be able to make plans to do things with and for other people, but it always seems that someone else in my family is demanding my time, yet they don't ever want to give it back.  Like my mom....

So, yeah. Maggie's sick again.  She woke up VERY early this morning, about 4am, and had a high fever and her cough was worse than it had been.  She threw up in bed, and I nearly had a panic attack.  It was like, all of a sudden, I had no idea where I was, what was happening, or what I was supposed to do.  How crazy is that?

I was supposed to babysit today, so I called to see if my mom could help me.  She wouldn't.  So, the feeling of guilt came so strong over me as I had to cancel on my dear friend and leave them, I'm sure, scrambling for other plans.

But, Maggie is my responsibility, my number one priority.  By the time I had contact with my friend, I had already spoken with the advice nurse and was waiting for a call from the pediatrician.  He called back and asked me to meet him at the urgent care facility in 15 minutes.  I rushed there and we ended up transporting her to the ER and then up to the Special Care Nursery, basically a level 2 nursery like the one she was in during her first week of life.

They ran some tests on her and got her fever down and gave her an IV right off the bat.  They followed with 2 minutes of oxygen every 30-35 minutes or so.  She seemed kind of out in space.  She wasn't herself and didn't show much interest.  They began nebulizer treatments and taught my mom and me how to use the one they were sending home with her.  (Yeah, mom finally decided it might be important enough to be there for me now.)

They also sent us home w/ a monitor that just tapes around her foot.  It sucks, because she's such a wiggle worm in bed, that it beeps if she pulls it wrong.

Anyway, they diagnosed her with RSV, which is a respiratory virus and very contagious for young children and elderly adults.  She was born prematurely, so is at higher risk of other problems.  The biggest for her being Apnea.  She had this for her first couple months of life and was on medication to strengthen her lungs.  They didn't feel the medication necessary now, but the nebulizer is supposed to keep her airways open and the monitor will indicate a problem while sleeping (which is when her apnea used to act up and she'd stop breathing.)

She came home early this evening and seems okay.  She's already a lot more alert and playful and thoroughly enjoys the Disney channel.  I thank my lucky stars that she's okay.  I cannot fathom a life without her.

It's been a strange week.  Kind of up and down and all over the place with my emotions and moods and general experiences.

Kent's birthday would have been the 10th.  I took flowers to his grave, and that always gets me.  He's buried next to his father, and I feel that, somehow, that's wrong.  That spot was meant for his mother and the marker has a picture of a man and woman hand in hand.  It's supposed to just be the symbol for eternity, but I can't help but feel it's weirdness.  I feel that he should be in a spot with an empty place next to him for me.  We vowed eternity to each other, not between him and his father.  Everyone discouraged this, as they feel I'm young enough to find another love in my life.  It still just seems weird.

We had a garage sale at my mom's this weekend and it was so hard to part with so many of Kent's things.  People would buy something and on their way out of the garage, they'd be telling their friend how they were gonna change that object or what they were going to do with it.  My eyes would well up with tears and I'd think ""They can't do that.  That's not what it was for.  Kent would be so mad.""  I couldn't help it.  It was almost like I expected Kent to walk up and ask me why the hell I was selling all his stuff.  It still hasn't completely hit me that I'm never going to see him again.  I'm waiting for it to.  I know when it does, it's going to hit hard and I don't know how I'm going to take it.

I long so badly for another's touch.  It will never be the same as being with Kent.  Not better, not worse, just not the same.  I've realized this, and don't feel I am ready for, or could participate in an actual relationship.  And, I'm not looking for some night of meaningless sex, either.  I just wish there was someone in my life who wouldn't mind just holding me, or stroking my hair, or gently touching my face; Even just someone who could lay by my side and let me cry without question.  Just to be there and wipe the tears. But, alone in my bed, night after night, I find myself further and further from this dream.

I miss my friends.  The one I babysit for has been somewhat distant from me and things haven't been the same between us for some time.  Not sure what exactly happened to change things, but I have an idea.  I had a bad dream about this friend talking and laughing about me with another friend of theirs.  I couldn't shake it.  The feeling of being a joke to someone just sucks.  I don't think they'd do that, but dreams have some way of feeling real sometimes.

I miss Erin.  She left me for California and at first was unhappy.  I didn't interfere with her dreams and let her do what she wanted, when deep down I just wanted to scream ""come home!""  She called me the other day and told me that she found a job and doesn't plan to come back.  I want only for her to be happy and get all she wants, but a part of me still wants it to not work out and for her to come back here.

My other Erin called me today and is pretty busy with life.  She's tried for a very long time to have a baby and it is really hard for her to come around me when I've got Maggie.  I think it makes her sad.  I know how that feels.

I heard from my Dad today.  That was kind of nice.  He was asking what I want for my birthday.  It's in 18 days, on the 2nd.  It's a Friday, which would be cool if any of my friends were around.  I suspect it will be no different than any other Friday night and I'll be home alone w/ the baby watching Joan of Arcadia and reruns of Boy Meets World on Disney.  Who knows.

Anyway... another day passes and when I awake tomorrow, a new one will begin.  We'll see how it goes and just what I can make of it.

Later all..."

"event","Just when things in my life seem to be heading in the right direction and look a little brighter, something, or someone I should say, finds a way to drag me down.  Whether intentional or not, you would think that someone who calls themselves a friend would be a little more compassionate.

Well that's the situation I'm in.  I have someone in my life that I'd do anything for.  I'd help in anyway possible to ease their sufferings or lighten their burdens, but when it comes to holding up their side of our friendship, they seem to think that just because they haven't ditched me, makes them a true friend.

I've been sick and not able to see any of my friends really.  This particular friend is one of the first I'd like to spend time with now that I'm feeling better.  I even made offers to get together and they had plans, or possible plans.  Yet, they invite someone else to do something AFTER declining to see me.  That kinda hurts.  Especially when I have really done a lot for this person and taken from my time and resources to do so.

Another thing that really bugs me with the friendship in question is that I am told by this person that I'm a friend.  That they know I'm here for them.  And I listen and am there as often as necessary.  Yet, they seem to shut me out a lot and that isn't so bad, but when you find them thanking someone else for their input and for listening, it kinda bites.  I am there in so many ways for this person, and it seems like it goes unrecognized.

Do I stop trying?  Do I need to back off completely and make this person have to take the initiative in contacting me??

I think that's what it will take.

We actually have talked about that before.  About how I am always the one who initiates conversations and such.  I am always the one pushing for them to pick a night to hang out together.  

Well, that's all going to change.  I am not intentionally giving a silent treatment, but if this person needs to talk to me, they need to contact me.  If they want to hang out, they need to invite.  Otherwise, as much as it will hurt me, I'm backing WAY off and they may not hear from me.

That's that."

"event","<P>Well, it's about time for my next chapter....</P>
<P>In making some changes, and turning a new leaf, I've also made some great revelations and realizations about my goals, my heart, and life in general.</P>
<P>I've started paperwork for heading back to school.&nbsp; I've not truly decided what I want to be or what I want to do, but picking up a few classes to get back in the swing of things is my plan for now.&nbsp; I was going to go back to Mt. Hood, but have decided to go to Clackamas.&nbsp; That way, I have a babysitter who lives right along the way.</P>
<P>I've been talking to a very good friend of Kent's.&nbsp; Someone he was best friends with in high school.&nbsp; He's a really nice guy and so sweet.&nbsp; He's really into Maggie and is very supportive of my goals.&nbsp; He constantly shows me he has the faith in me that I don't currently have in myself.&nbsp; I'm a little shaky in that area.&nbsp; He seems to be a perpetual student :)&nbsp; Is getting a great job now, but is also a student at Clackamas and is going to show me around and introduce me to some people there.&nbsp; That will be a big help.&nbsp; We may do lunch next weekend to talk more about it.</P>
<P>Some other goals that I'm getting closer to accomplishing.... hrm...</P>
<P>I am working on a new car.&nbsp; I was looking at used ones, but it seems my credit is not as bad as I originally thought, and it appears as though I may be able to get a new car at a decent rate and have low enough payments to still afford everything else and be comfortable in doing so.</P>
<P>The whole legal thing w/ my abuser and his current victim(s) is going well; Better than I thought.&nbsp; I have more strength in this situation than I ever knew existed inside of me.&nbsp; I have feared him all my life and even allowed it to destroy my first marriage.&nbsp; I allowed my fear of him and of men to run over into that marriage and became fearful and distrusting of my spouse, who was actually quite wonderful to me.&nbsp; I didn't see it until later when I went into counseling, and it's just like the old saying, that you never know what you've got until it's gone.&nbsp; He's long gone from my life, and it's quite sad.&nbsp; We were such good friends.&nbsp; I will always hold him as my first true love inside my heart, but I moved on, and so has he.&nbsp; I'm so happy he's found a place in life that he is happy with.&nbsp; That's all I have ever hoped for him.&nbsp; I still wish there were that friendship element between us, but I know that's long gone, too.</P>
<P>Anyway, I go next Wednesday to meet with some people to prepare for what comes next in the court process, etc... A lot is ahead of me, but I am starting to feel a sense of accomplishment in what I've done so far, and I know that what is coming won't be easy, but I can do it.</P>
<P>Tomorrow is Kent's birthday.&nbsp; I'm going up to the cemetery to take flowers and a pinwheel :)&nbsp; I'm still having to deal with his family, and his mother's issues seriously drive me to the point of wanting to slap her.&nbsp; I was raised to respect my elders, so I grit my teeth and tolerate her as little as I have to in order to get by without getting drastic.&nbsp; She seems to think she is the only one who feels the loss of MY husband.&nbsp; I don't know what exactly she thinks, but she acts as if I don't have feelings, too.</P>
<P>I miss Kent with all my heart.&nbsp; He was a huge part of my life.&nbsp; He WAS my life for a very long time.&nbsp; We took care of each other.&nbsp; We were soul mates, best friends, lovers, and at the end we were both parents to the most beautiful baby I have ever laid eyes on.&nbsp; I still wake up in a panic, my head damp with sweat, my heart actually aching and realize that the other half of my bed is empty.&nbsp; I know he's gone, yet it often feels like he is still here, and I think that's why I'm able to cope.</P>
<P>His mother calls to tell me how hard it is to see his picture on her wall.&nbsp; How does she think I feel?&nbsp; I see him in our daughter every day and night.&nbsp; I smell him even when he is not around.&nbsp; I lay in bed and feel his arms around me and I hear him whisper ""I love you"" in my ear.&nbsp; Everything about him lingers around me, in my mind, my heart, my soul.&nbsp; It's haunting.&nbsp; It's been almost 5 months he's been gone, and sometimes I still feel like he's going to call me, he's going to walk in the door, or he's going to pull up in the Thunderbird and drive me and Maggie away from here.&nbsp; Then it hits me, and I see him lying there on the bedroom floor.&nbsp; The tears flow, and my heart aches again.</P>
<P>I've been pretty sick the last couple weeks.&nbsp; I hate being sick, and I hate doctors.&nbsp; I started out with some minor flu symptoms, but it turns out that I had some underlying issues that have worsened and are cause for concern with my primary care physician.&nbsp; He's referred me out to specialists because he is unsure what to do.</P>
<P>So, it turns out that my diabetes was induced by my pregnancy, but was not limited to being gestational.&nbsp; It continues to be a health factor in my life, and because of other medications I am on, I was placed back on self-administered insulin injections rather than pill form.</P>
<P>Because of the diabetes, the flu, and what appears to be walking pneumonia, I have also been dealing with diabetic ketoacidosis and some pretty bad asthma attacks that used to be so infrequent and minor.&nbsp; They've got me back on blood pressure medication, prednisone, insulin, and now an antibiotic because my kidney is acting up again.</P>
<P>My doctor was overwhelmed, I think, and has me seeing an Endocrinologist who has, in turn, referred me to a nephrologist for my kidney problems.&nbsp; I have had frequent kidney infections, and one of my lab tests showed a high level of blood and proteins, so we have to look into that now.</P>
<P>I used to somewhat ignore doctors.&nbsp; I lost a cousin to leukemia and I always thought that I wouldn't want to know if something serious was going on.&nbsp; It wasn't until this week when the Endocrine specialist explained to me the seriousness of diabetes and the complications I've been experiencing that I've realized I need to really put my health in check and do whatever is necessary to ensure I'll be here for a very long time for my daughter.</P>
<P>So, I'm at the lab twice a day for the rest of this week, then just once a week for the next few weeks to see how things go.&nbsp; I have my fingers crossed, and can only hope that things get better.</P>
<P>It didn't help that my dearest and oldest friend, one from kindergarten, has now moved out of state.&nbsp; I miss her to death and can't wait until she gets her shit together and realizes it's here that she belongs.&nbsp; I've talked to her several times on the phone this week, and it seems she's already unhappy.&nbsp; I tried to encourage her to give it a try, because I know it's something she truly wanted to work out.&nbsp; But, if it doesn't, I will be happy to see her come home.</P>
<P>Well, I realize I'm a bit long winded... sorry about that... (if anyone actually reads this crap... lol)</P>
<P>That's all for now... whew!</P>"

"event","There's so much more to face in the coming months, but I did it.  I made the call to the DA this morning and they called me back shortly after.

I was so afraid that opening these old wounds would cause my life to unravel.  It actually has done the opposite.  It has helped me see that my life was in a tangled mess because of the suppressing I was doing.  Now that a lot of things are out, I feel somewhat liberated.

-------------

Things were going well today.  I had plans to take Maggie to my mom's overnight.  It was part of the plan to get me able to make it through a weekend without her.  I had planned to build up to it.  (I am going on a trip with some friends for a couple days in June.)  I'm kinda glad it didn't work out, but sad at the reason why.  Miss Maggie came down with some kind of bug today.  I don't know if she picked it up while I was babysitting, as one of the kids got sick, or if she just picked it up somewhere else.  Two of her cousins have had flu like symptoms the last week or so, too.  She has, so far, only had a fever and crankiness.  I have my fingers crossed that it doesn't go beyond that.  She has since been placed on the B.R.A.T. diet to help her through.

-------------

All other aspects of life seem to be headed in the right direction.  I actually feel good.

On a side note, I am super stoked for a few couples I know who get to go downtown tomorrow and get licenses for marriage.  Seems Portland is following San Francisco's lead and allowing same sex marriages.  It is about time!"

"event","Isn't it funny how you think you have a good thing... a good friend... and then it becomes more and more clear to you what should and shouldn't be happening in that relationship?  Like a moment of clarity, it just hits you one day that you've been conducting yourself in such an inappropriate manner that your friendship may be in jeopardy more so than your feelings?

Well, it seems I was right in thinking you can't trust people.  Anyone.  Strangers, Family, Friends... not a single person in my life right now is worth trusting, and most are not worth spitting at.

Maybe I'm just different in the way I view a friendship, but I hold my true friendships sacred.  Almost like a doctor or lawyer relationship, I hold all conversations and information shared between us as sacred.  As it should be.  Issues in my friendships are just that, in the friendship, and I don't think it very kosher to share all of that info with someone else, even if seeking advice from that person.

So, it seems that inadvertently, I have discovered that a good friend of mine has some less than good feelings about me and hasn't had the balls to share it with me.  Yet, sharing it with others seems to be an easy escape from facing their issues with me.  So, I've done a lot of thinking.  About life, love, friends, relationships, and pretty much everything, in general, that is effecting my life right now.

I have moved out on my own.  That is a step.  I may not be happy with the neighborhood right now, but eventually, I'll be able to change that.  For the time being, I have made myself as self-sufficient as possible.  The house is nearly complete, and has started feeling like home.  I've dealt with some of the ""living on your own"" kind of issues all by myself.  I know how to protect Maggie and myself, and have taken the step necessary to make it easier to do.  I have created a budget that will allow me to get a new car for Maggie and me, and that will mean finally getting rid of the hooptie Dodge Dynasty...

I have evaluated friendships and which ones mean the most and which ones I can actually see fading into the distance.  I have a very best friend, and at one time she was my partner.  She's moving away, out of state, but I've realized I need to stop being a baby about it.  She means a lot to me and I to her.  So, I know she isn't fading into the distance, she is simply moving away, and temporarily at that.  She did, however, share her deepest feelings and thoughts about some of our issues with another friend of ours.  It hurt so bad to find out from another just how she was feeling.  She knows that our friendship is strong and she should have come to me about it.  So, we talked a lot last night.  I realized a lot of other things about my life, not just regarding her, but regarding others in my life.

So, it seems I was totally trippin over a guy who was just a totally wonderful friend to me.  I started falling for him and thought I was in love.  Big joke.  Seems that after really evaluating my heart and my feelings, the love for Kent was simply so strong that it made it too easy to confuse my emotions.  I still love this friend of mine, but as just that... a friend.  I have seemingly made him uncomfortable with my words and actions, so I'm backing off.  Not completely bowing out of the friendship, but seriously backing off.  I couldn't imagine losing his friendship.  It seems I've got some sort of attachment anxiety.  I wanted to be close to someone, that it turned into anyone, and ended up my friend.  I never meant to cause him so much stress over it.

Okay, so, the most private of information I could share, is now going to be made public on here.  I am an abuse survivor.  Not just physical, but I am an incest survivor.  That is a big part of my issues and a huge battle within myself that I fight everyday.  Well, seems my abuser has struck again, and this time it was his daughter.  I was so down on myself the other night, and actually thought up some pretty stupid ways to punish myself. (Which, btw, I could never follow through with, because I know that I am the only one here for my daughter and plan to be here in a strong way for her.)  I kept thinking, though, how I could have stopped this or prevented this from happening to my little cousin.  I have held in information for a very long time that could have put this guy away a long time ago.  Well, I'm getting the nerve up, and will be telephoning the DA's office to give them the info I've been holding in for so long.  Turns out there is no statute of limitation for what he did to me, so my information along with his pending charges will put him away for a very long time.  I just pray I have the strength to go through it all over again, because in my mind, that's how it will feel.

I think if I can get through it, if I can even just make that phone call today, I'll prove to myself that I'm not as needy as I've been portraying.  I really do want to lead a normal, healthy life in a very independent way.  That is my goal, and each day, I plan to do something to make myself more independent and take myself one step closer to that goal's fulfillment.

Whew... 

So, seems my journal takes a new turn.  No more sappy poems or song lyrics to represent my feelings, just true facts and feelings and the story of my life turning a new leaf."

You hold the answer deep within your own mind. 
Consciously you've forgotten it. 
That's the way the human mind works.
Whenever something is too unpleasant, 
too shameful for us to entertain we reject it, 
we erase it from our memory, but the imprint is always there. 

We wash it all away, 
we wish it all away, 
we hope it all away, 
can't cry it all away. 

The pain that grips you
The fear that binds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual shame we hide our eyes
To blind them from the truth that finds a way to who we are

Please don't be afraid
When the darkness fades away
The dawn will break the silence screaming at our hearts
My love for you still grows
This I do for you
Before I try to fight the truth my final time

We're supposed to try to be real. 
We feel alone when we're not together, and that is real. 

Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away

Lying beside you
Listening to you breathe
The light that flows inside of you burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me
Of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this and I will die for you
Cast me not away
Say you'll be with me
For I know I cannot bear it all alone

You're not alone, honey, Never. Never. 

Can't fight it all away
Can't hope it all away
Can't scream it all away
It just won't fade away

Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away 
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away

Can't fight it all away
Can't hope it all away
Can't scream it all away
Oh get it all away
Oh get it all away

But the imprint is always there, nothing is ever really forgotten 

Because I'm dying too
because I'm dying too
because I'm dying too
because I'm dying too
because I'm dying too"

They don't have a fucking clue what I'm going through or what I'm feeling, and yet they get the bright idea that I actually WANT their input.  I don't.  I am having a very hard time even caring about myself right now, why the hell would I care about them?

I know.  I've got Maggie.  I care about her.  That has nothing to do with the feelings I'm experiencing.

The rejection of my emotions has become so common and I'm tired of hurting, so I've let part of me go numb.  Almost let a part of me die.  That's what it feels like.  I don't know how I could have been so stupid to let certain emotions develop in the first place.  The least I could have done was keep them to myself.  The rejection was inevitable, and I should have realized that sooner.

My family sucks.  All of them.  They don't give a shit about my well being or how I'm feeling.  All they care about is what kind of an impression my actions give others about them.

Grandma worries that dying my hair and wearing trendy clothes will make people think I'm a freak and that she raised a troublesome granddaughter.  Well, isn't that what she did?  What does she expect?

My asshole molester of an uncle is worried that if I continue going to counseling or therapy that the WHOLE truth about him will come out and he'll be affected in a bad way by it.  Good.  Stay out of my life! I hope you rot in hell you sick son of a bitch.

My mom thinks I need to get over the death of my husband and not be so hurt by it when things trigger my tears.  She thinks my grief shows weakness.  So... I'm weak.  Big deal.

Many of my friends seem to only be friends of mine when they want something.  I don't know why I allow myself to be used.  A girl I have known nearly all my life, but haven't talked to in 5 years called me this morning.  She came over today.  Wanted to see my daughter and visit.  Yeah, right.  She came over and had the nerve to ask me for money.  I just don't get people.

"event","<P>Well...it seems that no matter the choices I make, favors I do, or good gestures I offer up, they all come back to bite me in the ass.&nbsp; In one way or another, I end up regretting or nearly regretting my decision to do so.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM><U>Choices</U></EM></STRONG></P>
<P>So, I thought I needed to makes certain choices to move on with life and things would be made better by them.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I've been blindsided by aspects of life that I didn't think possible before becoming a widow; A widow with an infant, no less.</P>
<P>I made the choice to move into a place of my own.&nbsp; Instead, I've moved into a place that feels unsafe, lonely, and depressing.</P>
<P>I made the choice to allow myself to feel for someone again, and to open my heart up to the prospect of relationships.&nbsp; Instead, it seems the more love I feel, the more the pain that follows.&nbsp; And opening my heart only proved that there is no prospect and what I truly wish for is just beyond my grasp.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM><U>Favors</U></EM></STRONG></P>
<P>Well, I've done a lot of favors for people and usually not for anything in return.&nbsp; I don't expect anything when I agree to help out a friend or family member.&nbsp; But the hurt that comes with the lack of gratitude on their parts is almost unmeasurable.</P>
<P>I feel like I try and try to please people.&nbsp; I go out of my way and bend over backwards to do some things, and all I get is attitude when I can't do more.</P>
<P>There are, of course, those people who I'd do anything for and gladly.&nbsp; When I do things for these people, I feel horrible when I can't do more for them.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM><U>Good Gestures</U></EM></STRONG></P>
<P>Seems there are some people you just can't please, and it bugs the hell out of me that the most unpleased of these people are stuck in my life for at least the next 18 years, and likely forever.&nbsp; Of course, I'm referring to my in-laws.</P>
<P>They get pissed off at me when I don't make an effort to get them and Maggie together for a visit.&nbsp; So, I made the effort yesterday.&nbsp; I called up Kent's mom and invited her and his brother over for dinner tonight.&nbsp; They gladly accepted.&nbsp; She even called today and asked if there was anything she can bring.&nbsp; Well, here I sit.&nbsp; Alone w/ Maggie asleep on the chair. A cold pan of pork chops, a baked mashed potato dish, and home grown/home made cream corn is sitting on the stove.&nbsp; I just called to see where they were, as a part of me began to worry, and she told me they weren't coming over.&nbsp; No reason, they just didn't feel like it.</P>
<P>I almost hate being with them, so I'm not quite sure why it pisses me off so badly.&nbsp; It actually is a relief that I don't have to hear how I'm doing things wrong with my daughter, or how my furniture should be placed differently, or how I should change things in my life.&nbsp; All the time, what I wish I could change was that they weren't a part of it.</P>
<P>...........Stepping down from my soap box............</P>
<P>Can't really say how I'm feeling or how life is going right now.&nbsp; Life could be better, but I also realize how much worse it can be.</P>
<P>I'm sure I'll get over my stresses, but I just hate when I put effort into something and it fails miserably.</P>

"event","Okay... so out the window goes progress and in flies insecurities like I've never experienced before.

I heard ""The Dance"" by Garth Brooks today.  We played that at Kent's funeral.  It wasn't so bad.  I was able to get through the whole song w/ nothing but some watery eyes.  No tears fell, and I felt relieved.  When I heard that song for the first time after the funeral, I was on the freeway and pulled over for a 20 minute breakdown.  I felt progress was made and that the pain was possibly subsiding.

Until I got home.

I went over to my grandma's house (just across the street) and the bright idea they had in store for me was actually the worst they could have thought up.  They told me they were testing out my grandma's new vcr.  So, they wanted to see if the adapter for my camcorder would work and allow them to view home movies through it.

The empty television screen suddenly brightened with an image of a screaming baby on her first day home and taking her first home bath.  It was Maggie.  Just 7 days old.  Kent was the videographer.  Just seconds into the tape, I burst into tears and have been a wreck all night.  I heard his voice.  I can't even explain the whirlwinds of feelings I've been experiencing tonight.

I know I can get through this.  I really do believe that.

If it weren't for, what seems to be, my only friend in the world right now... I think I'd have crashed tonight.  Just being on the other end of the computer made him a savior tonight.  I was going crazy not having a soul to talk to.  Thank you Oompa.  :P  (Okay... I made myself smile, now.)

~~~

On another note... I had to wonder yesterday... do you think it'd be possible to sue a fortune cookie company for instilling false hopes in people?  

I had Chinese food yesterday and had the following TWO fortunes... yes the cookie was blessed....

""A pleasant surprise is in store for you.""
""Someone is trying to win your heart.""

Oh how I wish EITHER of those would come true.....

I've made a decision to stop being the one who is trying to win another's heart.  Things are great as-is and I don't want to ruin it.

But, what a pleasant surprise it would be for me if someone was trying to win MY heart :P

I do have faith that it will happen someday... I just feel that it will likely not be any time soon.  Kind of hard to find the type of person I have my heart set on who wants a fat gal w/ a baby... Perhaps by the time Maggie is dating, I will be, too. :P

Only time will tell.

"event","Up and down, up and down... and SO not in a good way.

I totally thought I was going crazy.  Like my mood was swinging in the most unnatural way.  I'm beginning to think I am the one now thinking clearly and the rest of the world (particularly the part that lives in this SE Portland neighborhood) are all fucked up.

Yeah, real rational, huh?

Anyhow...

I moved from the quietest, nicest little neighborhood to raise my daughter in her first years of life, in what is seemingly the melting pot of crime, hate, and unbelievable white trash!  And we are not talking your average, everyday white trailor trash.  We are talking half-naked, passed out w/ a needle in your arm, barely sheltered from the rain in your cardboard refrigerator box kinda neighborhood.  It's sick.

I watched a man slam his girlfriend's face into their mini van last night.  You can't imagine the view from my bedroom window.  It almost makes me glad I don't have a man.  My luck, the nice ones would pass me by, and I'd likely end up being that same view out someone else's bedroom window.

Needless to say, I called the police.  They arrived a bit late, only to find the girl had returned with friends and the parking lot was full of thugs, some with weapons.  I just kept thinking of all the different ways this situation could end up.  All the while, in the back of my head, I was wondering if I'd remember where the key for the gun cabinet was if I needed it in a hurry.  I wasn't going to keep Kent's guns, because of Maggie, but also because of her, I've reconsidered.

I began looking for a new place to live today.  I have only been moved in here a couple weeks, and it's already enough to drive me out.

What the hell am I going to do?  Who knows.

I only wish I had more answers.

Been filling out my paperwork for school.  That ought to be interesting.  Going back to college is not something I really thought I'd be doing, but Kent's passing has given me the opportunity and the time to do so.  I'm going to turn my Associates into a Bachelor's and then I'm not sure what to do.  Psychology can go a lot of different ways.  I was offered an opportunity back at the corrections department I was working at two years ago.  We'll see, though.

Well, things don't totally suck, I suppose, but damn! I wish I could have just one whole week of carefree living.  Simple.  Free from any worry, stress, or tears.  Soon, perhaps.  But again, who knows."

"event","Wow, it's been a while since my last post.  9 days. And even so, the last post wasn't really a post... was kinda lame.

So much has happened, and I don't know where to begin.  Everytime I think of posting, something or someone comes into play that makes me forget.  I actually sat down and wrote a long post but decided against actually sharing it.

It's been a strange week and my days feel like a roller coaster ride.  One day I'm up and the next I'm down.  It worries me.  

At the advice of the dearest of friends, I found a new counselor and have been working on several issues; listing them anyway, and now working on them one at a time.

A friend of mine thinks I am too dependent on having someone and that I need to work on being on my own.  At first I believed that and after a lot of thought, realized just how wrong that is.

I love being dependent.  I love being on my own, just not being ALONE.  There is a difference.  I don't NEED to have a partner or someone around.  Though, having a friend to talk to would be nice.

Here's the thing... I've been with someone and never really been ""on my own"".  I thought that is what made me dependent.  However, I looked back on these relationships, and I was always the one depended upon.  I never depended on others.  I took care of myself AND that other person.  If I have a dependency problem, it's that I tend to place myself into situations where I play a mother or guardian figure.

I've got Maggie now, and feel more fulfilled than ever.  

According to my counselor, I've gone through the ""correct"" or seemingly natural steps in grieving for my husband.  There are days that I miss him horribly, not as a husband or his ""husbandly duties"" but as the best friend he was to me.  Then there are days that it feels okay that he's gone and I am happy that life is going on.  Then, of course, there are those in between days where I just don't think about it.

So, this new counselor is helping me with other issues.  Past issues, how they affect the present, and what I will make of the future.
--------------------------
My new place is great, but the neighborhood sucks.  Three nights in one week, I've watched the parking lot next door and the thieves roaming it.  I often feel my duty is to call the cops, but was in a situation in the past where I had to testify in court because I was an eye witness to a crime, and I SO do not need that kind of issue in my life.  Especially being alone w/ a baby.

But, last night, I drew the line.  I watched as two men circled all the cars next door and finally spotted our parking lot.  They walked over and the whole time I stood in the window preparing for what I KNEW was about to happen.

They stopped at my car and eyed my stereo.  I had been so used to parking in a garage, that the faceplate to my stereo was still in place, and acted as an open invitation to these creeps.

Just as they got close enough to my car, I opened my bedroom window and hollered down at them.  Told them to get away from the car.  I didn't say MY car, which is probably why they got lippy with me and told me to mind my own business.  I really pissed them off when I told them it was my business cuz that was my car and I quick flashed them with the digital camera that was on my night stand.  They proceeded to pound on my front door while I called the cops.

I finally was able to get to bed and sleep at about 4am.  And, as you would expect, the rest of the night was spent tossing and turning with the strangest of nightmares running through my head.

Though last night wasn't a good one, it didn't spoil the mood I've been in the last couple of days.

I spent some good times w/ a very special friend and had a lot of fun this week.  It meant a lot to me.

Yesterday, Friday the 13th, was Maggie's 6 month birthday.  She's getting so big and doing so much now.  She's nearly sitting up completely on her own, but tends to tip a bit now and again.  She has a dr. appointment on Monday for more shots.  Poor baby.

I'm trying to get all my unpacking finished and hopefully will be done in the next couple days.

I guess that's all for now...."

The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life,<br>the number 0, and the element of fire.
His sign is the eclipsed sun.

As a member of Form 0, you are a determined<br>individual.  You tend to keep your sense of<br>optomism, even through tough times and have a<br>positive outlook on most situations.  You have<br>a way of looking at going through life as a<br>journey that you can constantly learn from.<br>Phoenixes are the best friends to have because<br>they cheer people up easily.

"event","Wow, I actually have quite a bit to write about in my journal tonight.  Good thing, because otherwise, I'd be so utterly bored out of my mind that I could almost cry.

Can you believe we are at the end of an entire month in this new year?  It seems crazy.

Anyhow, this week has gone surprisingly well.  I'm actually kind of proud of myself for the way I've begun to pick up pieces and move on with life.  It will probably continue to be a bit scary, but I'm sure I can do it. It helps to have those very special friends to help you through the hard times... (thanks, you big Oompa Loompa!) :P

Let's see... what have I done since my last real post??

It's been a pretty tiring week, actually.  It started last weekend.  You ever have one of those nights where it just seems nothing is going to go right?  Well, that was last Sunday!  I totally had a weird day and SO screwed up. I wrote something with one meaning in mind, and a very good friend read it and took it another way.  It nearly cost my relationship with them and it totally sucked!

I spent the entire next day reviewing what I had done and what issues I needed to be working on before I could ever expect a friend to understand.  So, the change process has begun.  (Things are now back to great w/ that friend, by the way.)

I made a list of things I needed to get for my new place and how I need to work on making it my own.  How can I make myself more independent and prove to myself that I don't need anyone for me to be okay?  I also have a horrible problem with being indecisive.  That, too, shall pass.

I have spent the week shopping and packing and moving and decorating.  I am so amazed at how much I've gotten done and am SO liking my new place more and more everyday.  So much, that I WILL be living there permanently starting this Monday. (I know I keep saying I'll be there, but this time, it's for real.  I was hesitant due to no computer access, but the cable guy is coming Monday morning. !!!)

Monday I spent the day thinking.  There was crying, and laughing, and working and playing... but I figured a lot out about myself and about those who flaked out on me, thus leaving me alone to my thoughts.... (ARGH)

Tuesday, I actually got quite a bit done, but you would not believe what I had to go through in the process!  I received a phone call on Monday afternoon from my mother-in-law asking for a favor.  The girl she works with at the dentist office has a 1 1/2 year old son who keeps getting sent home from day care.  Well, they called on Monday and told her that her son was suspended for 2 days!  How the hell do you suspend a baby??  I soon found out.

I agreed to watch the kid for her. ....and so it began...

Tuesday morning, around 7:30 (just as I was getting into the shower) the doorbell rang.  I knew it couldn't possibly be this boy and his grandmother, as they weren't due there for another hour and a half!  WRONG!  It was them.  So, in my jammies and messy hair, I answered the door with a little less than a smile on my face.  The kid REAKED!  The grandma said, ""I just changed him at Freddy's, but he smells poopy again.""  REALLY?

Either the woman is a liar, or this kid had a real problem that was soon going to make itself clear.

The woman left, and I carried the kid to the bathroom, practially one handed and by the ankles... lol.  (Not really, I AM good w/ kids...)  Anyhow, I've got the kid stripped down and in the tub within minutes of him being dropped off.  (YES, it was THAT bad!)  What could make it worse?  He had no extra clothes and the only food packed for him was applejuice!

So, off my mom goes to the local Goodwill store to find the kid some cheap threads to keep him from freezing his ass off while I got ahold of his mother (by the neck is how I'd like to have gotten her).  His mother first would not take my calls.  It took another bad diaper and the kid throwing up his breakfast in order for her to return my call.

I had plans to meet my aunt and her daughter to go to my storage unit that day, and those plans could not be changed.  So, I loaded Maggie and the sick kid into the car and off we went.  Met up with my aunt, and 2 year old Katie.  How fun was this going to be?

Well, luckily, both of my kids were asleep when we got to the storage unit, and as long as the mini van door was open, Katie was fine with watching us, too.  So, we loaded as fast as we could and went to my new place.  Unloading was a bit more difficult.

We went inside and put Maggie in her walker, Johnny in Maggie's playpen, and Katie just kinda ran all over and got into stuff.  We brought all the boxes in, and I even managed to get most of it unpacked!

I think that Johnny has emotional issues.  Some sort of separation anxiety, and makes himself sick.  On top of that, he seems to be easily amused by smacking his own head into the wall like he's got some sort of chemical imbalance.  I feel for him.

After more sickness and a slight temp, his mom finally arrived at 5:15!!  I was SO exhausted.  I knew for sure, after that, that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to.

Wednesday was planned to be another busy day at the new place, but ended up being a major recovery day.  I was still so exhausted that day, that I couldn't bring myself to do much of anything.  I emailed my friend a few times to make sure things were okay with us and worked a little on Kent's website graphics.  Other than that, nada.

Thursday was kinda cool.  I spent the day running all over.  I went to the new place and Maggie's nurse came over.  She checked the new house and played with the baby.  She was proud we were moving on and that I was taking control of my health issues.  Later that day, the doctor informed me that the blood pressure medication was working and was proud of me for taking the initiative to go on a diet.  I lost 2 more pounds since my last visit with him and my blood pressure was down to 130/81. A TON better than 167/102!

That night I went to a friend's for dinner and a movie.  I stopped and picked up Applebee's on the way and we watched Freddy Vs. Jason.  It was SO gross.  I could barely watch it.  I hate horror movies, I knew from the beginning it was going to be horrible.  But, it turned out pretty good ;) 

So glad they left it open for another... ha ha.

Friday was another kinda slow day.  I hung out a bit during the day and started to get bored.  I loaded Maggie into the car and we went shopping.  I hit the Goodwill stores close to my mom's house and got some cute stuff, grabbed some food, and went home to chill.

My mom went to a candle party and then out with her friends Friday night, so I ended up all alone.  I started to worry when I didn't hear from her and she wasn't answering her phone, but she finally answered around 2am.  And she freaks out at me if I'm gone past midnight!  Good grief!

Today I went to my grandma's cuz my cousin was there w/ his new girlfriend and his little boy.  He hasn't seen Maggie since Thanksgiving, so it was nice.  I am still a little ticked at him that he didn't go to Kent's funeral... he's a bit of a flake!

I left Maggie w/ grandma for a bit while my uncle and I went to my storage unit.  I got a whole truckload of stuff and hauled it to my new place.  So much to go through tomorrow now.  That should be fun.  I also found out that the storage facility has a smaller unit available, so it is on hold for me.  It is $70 cheaper per month, and the things I have left to store will fit nicely in there.  My last task is to find a truck to haul some furniture to my friend's house...

Well, that brings me to tonight.  My mom just got back from her ex-husband's house... how weird she is!  I just don't get it.  But I've just been relaxing.  Watched Star Search and am playing Solitaire 13 at Yahoo Games :)  It's very addictive.

Selfless, powerful, and<br>divine, you are one blessed with a certain<br>cosmic grace. You are unequalled in<br>peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of<br>Light your wings are massive and a soft white<br>or silver. Countless feathers grace them and<br>radiate the light within you for all the world<br>to see. You are a defender, protector, and<br>caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver<br>of the wrong, chances are you are taken<br>advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often.<br>But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in<br>everyone and so this mistreatment does not make<br>you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will<br>try to help misguided souls find themselves and<br>peace. However not all Angelics allow<br>themselves to be gotten the better of - the<br>Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting<br>for the sake of Justice and protection of those<br>less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever<br>change - the world needs more people like you.

"event","Well, today wasn't so bad.  My goofy mom had her ex over so I tried like hell to get out of the house and find something to do.  Luckily, I actually had a reason to get out and do stuff, so it made it easy to do it.  Usually I'd get the third degree and get treated like I was 12, but I think she must have wanted some disgusting ""alone"" time with him. <GAG>

Anyhow, so I went and did some shopping, hung out w/ Maggie, and spent some great visiting time with a very special friend.  It never fails, though... No matter how great the time, I always seem to leave remembering what I do not have.  

Thus, today's musical quote of the day:
""You're the closest to Heaven that I'll ever be, and I don't want to go home right now.""
Iris by Goo Goo Dolls from the City of Angels Soundtrack

Anyhow... all else seems to be going pretty well.  I plan to spend tomorrow moving some more furniture into the new place and later that evening watching American Idol at a friend's house.

On Tuesday, plan on moving more stuff into the new place and then watchin movies at another friend's house.

Maggie gets her 5 month pictures done tomorrow... should be fun.  She got a new outfit yesterday at Hot Topic, but my mom SO does not want her pictures taken in it.  Whatever.

I made it through the 3 month anniversary of Kent's death, and it went pretty smoothly.  There were moments that I remembered the date, but for the most part, it was okay.  I was even at a friend's place today and they had music going.  I heard one of the songs from the funeral and though the friend offered to turn it off, I said no.  I listened to the whole song and not one tear fell.  I don't know if that is considered progress, but three months ago, that song came on the radio and I had to pull over to the side of the freeway until I was okay to drive again.  So, I'd say... that's progress.

Anyhow... nothing totally exciting to report on or write about.  Just hoping I get all moved in this week and totally the hell outta here.  I love my mom... but man is she a loonybin!

Lata!


And, yet, another musical quote:
""And Tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be loves suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life""

I'll Be by Edwin McCain"

"event","Well... this might seem strange, but it's something I do.  Each day that I write in my journal, even if there's nothing really to write about, I always write down a favorite quote from a song and it usually pertains to my mood or how I'm feeling.

Once again, I'm feeling pretty good.

Yesterday was a bit hectic.  I ended up having to make a couple trips to the hospital lab and pharmacy for tests to find out about my blood pressure. Who knows.

Love and relationships and friendships all seem to be one big crazy ball of ""HUH?"" right now but I have sorted through much of it that needed attention or changes.

The attention was good.  Not too many changes needed to be made, but more of an adjustment of attitudes and direction of feelings.  Is much easier to deal with now.

I wake up everyday with a smile on my face, and it feels great.  I realize I have a lot to live for, and though I don't have all that I want or all that I emotionally long for, I'm getting there.  Some things will always remain unobtainable.  That sucks, but hey... that's life.

Today's musical quote for the day:

""Sometimes you've just got to let it ride.""
From Love Will Keep Us Alive by The Eagles"

"event","I totally had, like, this moment of clarity last night.  It was the weirdest thing.  I always hear people talk about them and even Kent had his moment of clarity that gave him the strength to get sober.

Mine didn't have to do with an addiction, really, but it certainly cleared up a lot of confusion in my mind and made a lot of situations so much better and a lot easier to deal with.

I hung out with a buddy last night and ate pizza, cinnastix (YUM!), drank soda, and got really fat and bloated to watch movies :) Was pretty kewl.

Anyhow.. on the way home so many thoughts were spinning around in my head.  I cried, I laughed, I wasn't sure what was going on.  I almost had to pull over to try and make sense of it all.  Then, BOOM!, it hit me.

I knew exactly how to handle certain situations within my family, I figured out what certain friendships mean to me and how I needed to word things when I express it to those who need to hear it.  (If any of that makes sense... lol)

So, I started right away last night.  I cleared the air with a relationship that needed it and shared my feelings, thoughts, and revelations.  Then this morning, dealt with a family issue that's been tearing at me for a while now.

Today is the 15th.  Three months since Kent's been gone, and I feel good.  I actually do.  I FEEL GOOD.  I miss him, of course.  I feel all the grief and the feelings I should have when losing someone.  However, I've learned to deal with those feelings.  I don't feel like moping.  I don't feel like being depressed.  I really do feel good.

I woke up with a smile and had a perfect night's sleep.  Both of which have been pretty scarce lately.

I was at my new place yesterday and this morning.  My bathroom is all decorated... I started putting some things away.  I've got to get some chairs in there and finish some moving in, but it should be done by next week.  It will be so awesome!

Anyhow.. I'm feeling good... doing good... looking forward to some fun times ahead... :)

WOO HOO!"

"event","Can ADD/AD-HD medication cause sleep apnea?

I&#39;ve always had trouble focusing in school, and never really knew why. &nbsp;I was never the hyperactive type so it took a long time before I got a diagnosis, and medication.

I&#39;ve been on my current ADD medication (Strattera) for almost 10 years now. &nbsp;There are some heartburn side-effects, but I manage them well enough with other medication.

Then, rather suddenly last year I noticed I was waking up almost every hour at night. &nbsp;I got myself checked out, and it turns out I have central sleep apnea (typically people have obstructive sleep apnea where there is a physical blocking of the airways, central sleep apnea is when the brain fails to tell the body to inhale).

Every time I see my doctor for the Strattera medication, I&#39;m asked whether I have any trouble sleeping, and I&#39;ve just now put two and two together that, <i>could my sleep apnea be caused by my medication?</i>

I&#39;ve been poking around web sites trying to see what people are saying. &nbsp;Officially, no, that&#39;s not one of the published side-effects of Strattera. &nbsp;...but then again, neither is heartburn (which my doctor says is extremely common).

I Googled it to see if anyone else with Strattera had been diagnosed with sleep apnea, and I found a lot of people saying that they have sleep apnea and they are also taking ADD medication. &nbsp;My knee-jerk reaction was to proclaim that I&#39;d found the missing link, and that I might be the first to have associated Strattera with sleep apnea!

However, a Google search does not give statistically valid data. &nbsp;Maybe only 10 people on the planet reported these symptoms together and all blogged about it, and&nbsp;even if it was common to find the two things together, it would be hard to determine a causality. &nbsp;&quot;Correlation is not causation,&quot; as my psychology professor would say, or in other words, just because you find two events or characteristics together does not mean one causes the other.

Consider this: &nbsp;I might have had sleep apnea for a long time and not realized it, but the lack of sleep could have made it hard for me to focus, thus the diagnosis of &quot;inattentive&quot; ADD. &nbsp;So perhaps I&#39;m taking Strattera to treat the side-effects of what really has always been a sleep disorder.

However it would be interesting to find if the people who were treated for sleep apnea found their ADD went away."

"event","In some ways, computers are like cars.&nbsp; They're expected last for a certain amount of use, and then certain components start to fail.&nbsp; For a car, it's about 100,000 miles.&nbsp; For a computer, it's about 2-3 years.

The power supply shipped with an OEM prebuilt system is just enough to get by for 2-3 years of heavy use.&nbsp; First indication of power supply problems is brief interruptions of power to the motherboard or the drives.&nbsp; This is indicated by the drive sounding like it's spiinning up, by lockups, &quot;blackouts&quot; (screen goes black and stops responding, sometimes with screen artifacts), or by an unexpected reboot when the system seemed to be idle.&nbsp; Power supplies are rated in terms of how many hours of use until expected failure, and they don't particularly like it when you add a couple more drives or other components.&nbsp; The wattage delivered is just barely above what's required in the initial build.

The second thing to fail is usually the hard drive.&nbsp; Again, the margins (profit) on computers are super-thin, so they use the cheapest hard drive they can find.&nbsp; The margins on hard drives by themselves are super-thin, so HDD manufacturers sometimes cut corners.&nbsp; Bargain hard drives do not deliver good value.&nbsp; For that reason, RAID1 configurations (a pair of drives that mirror each other) are great investments, especially if you've got family photos you want to preserve.&nbsp; When one drive starts to fail, replace both of them.&nbsp; Some of Microsoft's more recent products will tell you when the drive is failing.&nbsp; There's also a BIOS&nbsp;feature called SMART&nbsp;that can tell you if something is amiss.

I recently read someone's post about not using canned air to dust a system.&nbsp; Actually, I find this useful, but you do have to be careful because dustbunnies can conduct electricity and short certain components.&nbsp; The system should be off, should be cool (let it sit for a while -- the canned air is very cold and capacitors don't much like sudden temperature changes), and you need to blow the dust *out* of the computer, not into it.&nbsp; I've also heard that canned air leaves corrosive residue on the parts that's possible, but I&nbsp;can't confirm it.&nbsp; In all the years of cleaning out computers with canned air, they never failed any more quickly than systems that had never been blown out with canned air.


Is it worth it to replace the components instead of the PC?&nbsp; Well, depends on your needs.&nbsp; A PC&nbsp;with a better power supply and hard drive will last you another good 5 years easily.&nbsp; Usually I have to buy a new machine when I start having compatibility problems with newer components or software I want to add, and not because of a failure.&nbsp; If your old machine just isn't performing well with new software, or if you find yourself paying a premium for a memory upgrade to an &quot;antique,&quot; you may be better off replacing the whole machine.&nbsp; 

Most motherboards, memory, video cards, sound cards, mice, keyboard, and monitors last practically forever.

Oh, and one more thing:&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy the 5-year extended warranty for your printer.&nbsp; It's worth it."

"event","A common mistake I've seen startups make is that though they focus on their customers for feedback, they treat those customers as representative of what the entire market wants.&nbsp; Current customers are a&nbsp;fantastic start for exploratory research when you have lots of customers, but to validate that feedback when you have very few customers, a startup needs more than just the customer contacts from their last product.&nbsp; You need a sample that's representative of the target market as a whole, and not just the customers who liked the startup's last product&nbsp;(otherwise you might be limiting your scope too much).

Only trouble is, if you're a startup, getting a market research firm to asemble a sample, write a survey, and write up a report about the findings will break the budget for the year.&nbsp; Might not be a problem if that's the only product you're going to launch this year but it is a problem if the offering is not accepted by the target market and you have to redo the study with some changes.

So here are six low-budget ideas (somewhat skewed but usually sufficient)&nbsp;for finding customers that will be willing to answer some questions.
1.&nbsp; Reach out to contacts of employees to diversify the sample.
Beware of going to the well too many times, but the company's employees have probably worked places other than your company and many of their former coworkers have moved on to other companies too.&nbsp; Encourage your employees to check their LinkedIn profiles to&nbsp;see just who might be a customer.

2. LinkedIn Groups
Post a discussion topic to an existing LinkedIn group that deals with your product's subject matter.&nbsp; Or if you prefer&nbsp;(and this takes longer)&nbsp;create a new group that becomes an online advisory panel.&nbsp; These discussions become a great way to conduct focus groups.&nbsp; Still not as good as a real focus group because people who don't find value in the offering won't post, but you can use bit.ly or ow.ly to see just how many are interested in the pitch an compare that to who comments.&nbsp; The question or research topic has to be carefully constructed to get valid results if you're measuring it this way.

3. Facebook Groups
Your company has fans.&nbsp; Somewhere.&nbsp; There may even be a Facebook fan group for your company right now, and all you have to do is post a question.&nbsp; People on Facebook generally have more time to spare, so you're more likely to get ruthless feedback this way.&nbsp; That is, people on Facebook are more likely to take the time to tell you their honest opinion (rather than ignore the post and walk away) than the busy professionals on LinkedIn.&nbsp; 

4. Toluna
Used to be called &quot;Your 2 Cents&quot; but now they allow anyone to post a question (though only one!, if you want more, you can invest in a Toluna panel which is paid for their time)&nbsp;to their board and get statistical feedback.&nbsp; If you're good at writing your own research questions, this might be a great way to get quick opinions.&nbsp; These people are at Toluna's web site to answer questions, so they will click on your post expecting to respond to a question.

5.&nbsp;Twitter
That's right; the same forum where your niece just tweeted what color she painted her toenails is a great place to search for what people are saying about any topic you can think of (and if you design nail polish, you might want to check your niece's friends' replies!).&nbsp; Search for any topic and get instant feedback on what people are saying.&nbsp; It's best to check the entire thread to put the 140 character tweet into context.

6. GetSatisfaction.com
Your India-based customer service team may not have been trained on where to send that feedback, your corporate phone operator doesn't know either, and there's no link on your web site for gathering product feedback, so they start a topic here and the customers talk amongst themselves.&nbsp; So where do they go?&nbsp;&nbsp;They Google for you, and find your free focus group on GetSatisfaction.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of benefits for a free account of course, but people post there because they want to.&nbsp; Doesn't even cost you ten&nbsp;$25 gift certificate to Amazon.com.

The problem with all of these, of course, is that this is an &quot;opt in&quot; sample, but if you ask the right questions to attract responses, it can be just as valuable as a truly random sampling."

"event","I drive my wife crazy with my GPS.&nbsp; My GPS&nbsp;is a form of safety (I&nbsp;can use the traffic kit to determine the best way around known road hazards), it's how I get to appointments on time even when I don't know the area, it's my yellow pages, and it's how I know I will find a gas station or a restroom when I need one.&nbsp; So I use it on every trip, even the trips I've done a hundred times.

When I get home, I upload my GPS&nbsp;traces to openstreetmap.org so that others can benefit from my wanderings including the average speed on roads I routinely travel on, the location of obscure roads, and the locations of key points of interest.

Yeah, she accepts it.&nbsp; It's just one of those things... can't start the car unless I have my GPS, gotta' wire up the traffic kit, etc.&nbsp; ...and there are times that she's thankful for having one.


Things I want on my next GPS:
*&nbsp;Voice-activated everything
My GPS&nbsp;is my guide.&nbsp; Turning features on and off through deep menu systems just isn't helpful at 70 mph.&nbsp; On my existing GPS&nbsp;I've reduced the menus, but it's still not safe to have to lean over and use the touchscreen.

*&nbsp;Traffic kit without suction cups
&quot;Hello everyone, I have a super-duper GPS.&quot;&nbsp; I've got suction cups all over my windshield, and even if I put it away, it leaves suction cup markings, which is another way of saying, &quot;check the glove compartment.&quot;

*&nbsp;Offroading
Though maps show trails, my GPS was not made for hiking, offroading, etc.&nbsp; The battery lasts about&nbsp;5 minutes when not connected to a charger, and the marker snaps to the nearest drivable road.&nbsp; I'd like to be able to go on openstreetmap.org geocaching trips and map this stuff out, but I just don't have the equipment.

*&nbsp;Processing power
Thanks to my GPS, I have a computer in the car.&nbsp; However this computer isn't very powerful.&nbsp; I've tried adding aplications to it, but it really just can't keep up with that and me driving at the same time.&nbsp; I've had to dumb down my openstreetmap.org tracing application, and videos for the kids?&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget about it.

*&nbsp;Internet access
I would love to be able to access GasBuddy on my GPS&nbsp;for accurate gas prices and save some money.&nbsp; ...and yes, I can do that with my current GPS&nbsp;but it involves a fee to my cell phone carrier and a very intermittant success rate with the Bluetooth connection.&nbsp; What a hassle.

* Intuitive interface
Seems like half the devices on the market were never street-tested.&nbsp; Can you do it while driving?&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as the passenger?&nbsp; Is the screen visible when the sun hits it?&nbsp; How about, &quot;show me on the map all gas stations within 5 miles&quot;?&nbsp; How about, &quot;I'll take a GPS-fixated picture to prove that this street is permanently closed so that the next rev of the map is accurate&quot;?&nbsp; Lots of room for improvement here."

"event","If you've been poking around for job hunting tips for more than a month or two, you'll notice a theme -- the key to finding a job in this economy is business networking.&nbsp; It's not about what you know, it's who you know.&nbsp; All of the literature says the right person recommending you at the right time will get you a job offer, and that 80% of candidates are hired this way.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are at least four ways to go about this.&nbsp; No one way of doing it will yield you results; the key is really to combine them.&nbsp; <br /><br /><u><strong>Large business networking events:<br /></strong></u>If you you're looking for your next boss, he's likely to be here.&nbsp; Your mission is to figure out where he is by asking targetted questions.<br /><br />These could be job-hunter events, they could be industry-specific, or they could even be role-specific.&nbsp; For me, examples include <a href=""http://www.pinkslipmixers.com"">Pink Slip Mixers, </a><a href=""http://www.svpm.org"">Silicon Valley Product Managers Association</a>, and even the annual trade shows like the <a href=""http://www.rsaconference.com"">RSA&nbsp;Conference</a> and <a href=""http://www.linuxworldexpo.com"">Open Source World</a>.&nbsp; These events are attended by large groups of people (&gt;100)&nbsp;who have something in common with you.&nbsp; Tactics that work: <ul><li>Know what companies you want to work for, and ask around, name-dropping those companies.&nbsp; People will volunteer contacts.</li><li>Network with other job-seekers.&nbsp; They know what the job market is like and are more likely to put in the effort.&nbsp; Of course, they're hoping you'll return the favor.</li><li>Business cards.&nbsp; You can print them at home, or you can get near-free ones made through <a href=""http://www.vistaprint.com"">VistaPrint.com</a>.&nbsp; <br /><ul><li>They should list your top 3 unique skills.&nbsp; If you're not sure what skills to list out, print them at home in batches of 20 instead of ordering a box of 200 of them from VistaPrint.&nbsp;</li><li>If possible include your picture to make you memorable.&nbsp; It's easy for people to forget you if they met a lot of people during the event.&nbsp; At least the picture will increase the odds that they'll remember you.</li><li>It should include a link to your LinkedIn profile or another site listing your job history.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Resumes:&nbsp; Bring about 5 of them to the event.&nbsp; In most cases, you'll hand out business cards and people who are interested in you can look you up.&nbsp; The resumes are for the people who seem genuinely interested in hiring you.&nbsp; Print it on nice resume paper.</li><li>Know your elevator pitch!&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll be saying it a lot, so get it right and memorize it.&nbsp; Remember, if it's not short enough that they know who you are by the time the elevator door opens on the 3rd floor, it's too long.</li></ul><u><strong>Small business networking events:<br /></strong></u>These include small job-hunting support groups you'll find on meetup.com.&nbsp; These are your support groups that have semi-regular attendees.&nbsp; These people have a good idea of what you're looking for and they'll watch for opportunities that might be relevant to you.&nbsp; Of course, you're expected to do the same for them.&nbsp; Tactics that work: <ul><li>Bring some business cards (see above).&nbsp; A picture on your card is not quite as important for this setting since everyone will get to know each other.</li><li>Bring about 5 resumes (see above)</li><li>Bring LinkedIn for iPhone -- if you have an iPhone and your LinkedIn profile is fairly comprehensive, you'll find it handy to bring you network with you so that you can talk to people about who you know.</li><li>Know who you want to work for.&nbsp; Someone at one of these events once told me she was looking for a Software Quality Assurance Manager position.&nbsp; I couldn't think of anything.&nbsp; Then she said she was thinking she'd like to work for Visa.&nbsp; I've got several contacts there, but never thought about them needing SQA&nbsp;Managers.&nbsp; ...and then I&nbsp;remembered someone who used to work at Visa but now works elsewhere in the industry.&nbsp; Like I said before, specific targets help jog people's memories.&nbsp;</li></ul><u><strong>Online networking:<br /></strong></u>Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Facebook present opportunities to brand yourself.&nbsp; Recruiters now can look everywhere to find the right candidate.&nbsp; Job boards are only for finding those very unique people because they have to pay for access to those boards. <ul><li>Before posting a resume online, review it with someone who has hired for your position before.&nbsp; They know what they look for in a resume, and probably cost you less than those so-called &quot;professional&nbsp;resume writers,&quot; though if you can find a professional writer who used to be a hiring manager for your role, that's worth every penny.</li><li>This is the resume for your ideal job.&nbsp; Highlight what makes you unique, and the job skills for the position you would most want to have.&nbsp; That's the only resume worth broadcasting.&nbsp; All other resumes you send out need to be tweaked to match the language of the job description you're applying for.</li><li>Your next job probably won't come from a job board unless you're a very unique individual.&nbsp; Recruiters turn here to find those hard-to-find candidates.&nbsp; People with 5+ years of experience in solar technologies, the mobile expert with a background in enterprise server technologies, the IT&nbsp;pro who is now a medical doctor, etc.&nbsp; It doesn't hurt to post your resume there.&nbsp; If you're an exact match, the opportunity is likely to be lucrative.</li></ul><u><strong>One-on-one:<br /></strong></u>This is perhaps the <u><em>most important</em></u> type of business networking you can do.&nbsp; If you need to, stop doing the others so that you can spend more time here.&nbsp; The people who know you best are the most likely people to give serious thought as to how they can help.&nbsp; You should touch base regularly (at least once a month, preferably more frequently than that)&nbsp;with people who can tell others about the high quality of work you do.&nbsp; They're your best bet for finding a job.&nbsp; If you find a compelling match between you and an employer using one of the previously mentioned methods, it's these one-on-one interviews that will give you the job references you'll need later to get the job offer.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Is there anything I missed?<br /><br />"

If you're supposed to ask your doctor what they think about your child and you get the doctor on call instead, it's almost guaranteed they won't say the same thing your doctor will say when you go in for the checkup.&nbsp; Same thing for resumes, everyone has a different opinion, each with facts backing up their stance:<br /><br />Do you include an objective at the top?<ul><li>Of course!&nbsp;&nbsp;That's where your searchable keywords are and how they get to know something about who you are and what you're like.</li><li>Don't bother.&nbsp;

"event","I hope I don't end up kicking myself for the next 5 years, but I had to make a difficult decision today.&nbsp; I received a job offer, exactly what I wanted to do, at the type of company I wanted to work for, in a part of the world where everyone is friendly, kids are safe, medical care is paid for, and at a company that would really appreciate what I can do for them.<br /><br />First, the job:&nbsp;&nbsp;Director of Product Management for an open source software company.&nbsp; This is a type of software I understand very well.&nbsp; I have both experience and training in some of the newest techniques to determine what a customer will buy.&nbsp; I have leadership skills that can be used to focus a group on the needs of the customer.&nbsp; The company in question has never had a product manager before.&nbsp; I know I could make a measurable difference. &nbsp; <br /><br />...but I'm afraid I have little choice but to turn it down.&nbsp; <br /><br />First off, it's expensive to get up there.&nbsp; The employer was going to help with that, but we would still wipe out our savings to get through immigration and move up there.&nbsp; For the right opportunity I was willing to do that.<br /><br />We would be far from friends and family, but I expected we could make new friends to be our support system.&nbsp; Family that relied on us could probably manage without us for a couple of years, and of *course* they would miss us, but I've always said I would do almost anything for the right opportunity.<br /><br />It would be insanely cold in the winter.&nbsp; Colder than I knew was even possible; I can't even imagine -40&deg;C (which translates to about -40&deg;F).&nbsp; The clothes required for a Californian to survive a few minutes out there might add up quickly, but I figured eBay, garage sales, and &quot;freecycle&quot; events could take care of that.&nbsp; The cars would need block heaters and snow tires.&nbsp; We might have a few medical problems as we adjust, but we <u><em>would </em></u>adjust.<br /><br />We would only be able to afford a small townhouse/condo on the outskirts of town because I knew that we wouldn't be able to cover all of our property expenses in San Jose.&nbsp; Sophia would gets cabin fever after 1 day inside as it is, and we would be asking her to stay inside for several months in a much smaller home.&nbsp; ...but there are indoor activities, some of them are even free, and she would adjust.&nbsp; Even if we sold our home at a loss, we would have leftover loans for the amount not repaid from the sale of the house.<br /><br />Alas, I underestimated this last point.&nbsp; We had someone give us an estimate on what our property would be worth to a renter.&nbsp; It's worth far less than we expected.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only way we could afford to live there would be if we walked away from our financial obligations.&nbsp; It would ruin our credit history, and more importantly, it's against my ethics.&nbsp; I'll do almost anything for the right opportunity.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp; Ethics are too important.<br /><br /><br />Expensive relocation, expensive to either maintain or sell the property I have in California, we have family who wants us to stay,... and yet, EXACTLY&nbsp;what I was looking for in a job.&nbsp; This is the kind of job I've been trying to create for myself at multiple companies.&nbsp; ...and there it was!&nbsp; A job offer to do exactly that!&nbsp; ...and I have no choice but to turn it down.<br /><br />I have a lot of competition for that kind of job here in the silicon valley.&nbsp; I really, really doubt that I can find that kind of job here.&nbsp; Far more senior product managers are doing the same kinds of things.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I moved elsewhere in the United States, might I find the same opportunity?&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps.&nbsp; We'd still be down a lot of money every month, but if the cost of living is low enough and the salary high enough we could manage it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, low cost of living usually means low salary.<br /><br /><br />On the brighter side, maybe this had to happen.&nbsp; I had to have a taste of what's possible so that one day I could be the more senior PM that can get that job.&nbsp; So in the mean time, who's hiring people like me?<br />"

"event","As I was reading my marketing textbook this afternoon which spoke of effective and ineffective advertising technique, I was reminded briefly of the many abandoned podiums I've seen at trade shows.&nbsp; 

Backing up a moment, for people who aren't familiar with trade shows, the pitch at a trade show to exhibitors is often that if you pay for the booth space, you can use it almost any way you want to and the trade show staff will do the advertising for you.&nbsp; They'll make sure the people that attend the trade show or expo hall are the people you want to talk to, and they'll be up front about who they're aiming to attract.

To the exhibitor, the difference between a &quot;good show&quot; and a &quot;bad show&quot; is whether they got enough target customers visiting the booth.&nbsp; 

I have long said that it's not enough to build a better product if no one knows it's there.&nbsp; The same can be said about marketing.&nbsp; Simply being at a trade show is not enough; you either need to get other exhibitors to send customers your way or have built up enough of a brand prior to the show that people seek you out.&nbsp; The same goes for any other type of promotion or advertisement.&nbsp; Whether it's in a magazine or on TV, you still have to be able to grab the attention of the target audience.&nbsp; A 2 for 1 deal is not going to get any new customers if they don't know you're running the promotion.&nbsp; An advertisement for Barbie dolls that runs during a football game is money wasted unless the buyer or the child who will play with the toy not only observes the commercial but actually listens to it and is motivated to take action because of it.


My role in this?&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;love technology.&nbsp; I love &quot;better.&quot;&nbsp; ...and it's painful to see someone doing something in a way that I&nbsp;know can be done better with the right techniques or tools.&nbsp; 

Ultimately, that is what I seek to solve in my career.&nbsp; Product requirements gathering and market research helps me tell engineers how to build a better product for the customer to use.&nbsp; Marketing is one tool I've used to draw attention to what was built.&nbsp; Education is what I&nbsp;use to help people learn how to use the technology effectively.&nbsp; My role doing technical support makes something usable again when things go wrong, and provide feedback into the research, completing the cycle.&nbsp; 

I'm happy in all of these roles.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can get very motivated about all of these things.&nbsp; I think that, more than anything else, is why product management is an excellent fit for me."

"event","The concept of grid computing isn't new.&nbsp; Long before Microsoft Windows was popular, Bill Gates spoke of a vision that one day you could plug a terminal into a wall in any home and have access to productivity and communication software.&nbsp; We're almost there today.&nbsp; Internet access is as necessary in most American households as a telephone, and even in impoverished areas of the country a cell phone can provide basic browser access.<br /><br />What most people don't realize, though, is that they have tons of digital electronics in their homes that are constantly waiting for something to do.&nbsp; They go through the same Fetch-Decode-Execute (FDE)&nbsp;cycle as a computer:<ul><li>Fetch:&nbsp; Retrieve the status of all inputs.&nbsp; Could be a button on a keyboard a dial on a mouse, or even the status of the soap door on a dishwasher.</li><li>Decode:&nbsp;&nbsp;What's happening?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything to do?&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, a &quot;noop&quot; command is issued, which is functionally the same as adding 0 and 0 or asking if 0 = 0.&nbsp; Futile, but it gets us through this necessary cycle.</li><li>Execute:&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's do whatever we're supposed to do (0+0=0, store that result in &quot;no man's land&quot; and prepare for the next &quot;fetch&quot;)</li></ul>and then the cycle repeats.&nbsp; Usually that cycle repeats many times per second.&nbsp; So we have millions of little devices, many of them fairly low-powered but still doing binary and often mathematical operations.&nbsp; What if each microprocessor could contribute resources to the great grid?&nbsp;&nbsp;They could search for a vaccine for AIDS, help with genetic engineering of healthier rice, search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, or just run a copy of Microsoft Word for school child in Ethiopia.&nbsp; My clothes washing machine doesn't know of these demands, nor does my answering machine, my cell phone, or my daughter's toys.&nbsp; Instead they remain idle, in very low power mode, but still asking me to pay for an electricity bill just so that they can be responsive when they're needed.<br /><br />In the corporate world, the fax machine is doing the same thing.&nbsp; So is the copier.&nbsp; So is the printer.&nbsp; ...and though they do reduce power when idle and often slow down their cycles, someone is still paying the electricity bill for them to remain on.&nbsp; <br /><br />What if embedded processors had built-in access to the Internet?&nbsp; What if your programmable rice maker could actually help with genetically engineering better rice?&nbsp; What if my dishwasher could join other dishwashers in designing a better kind of soap?&nbsp; What if my radio could join the SETI&nbsp;project, listening for transmissions from space?&nbsp; <br /><br />We're not far from that goal today.&nbsp; All we would need is for someone like ARM&nbsp;to make processors with embedded wireless technology.&nbsp; A carrier isn't even required; perhaps it could Bluetooth to the nearest cell phone or tap into an 802.11 network the customer has already set up in their home.&nbsp; Honestly, why couldn't my consumer electronics join the grid computing movement?<br /><br />Finally, what if buying such devices was worth a tax deduction because it does help end poverity and disease worldwide?&nbsp; Maybe then I finally wouldn't feel like I was paying for my electronics to do such useless things each month.<br /><br />The <a href=""http://boinc.berkeley.edu"">BOINC&nbsp;project</a> allows you to do this with your home computer.&nbsp; ...but there is a catch.&nbsp; By default, your CPU&nbsp;usage will be through the roof, meaning your power bill will be too.&nbsp; Buy yourself a &quot;Watts Up,&quot;&nbsp;&quot;Kill-a-Watt,&quot; or similar device (or borrow mine, just call me) to measure the actual power consumption of your computer.&nbsp; Using this device you can tweak the usage.&nbsp; It is possible to tweak BOINC&nbsp;so that the load from these research projects doesn't actually take up any more power and instead of noop commands, your computer would be doing useful work.&nbsp; About 40% was the threshhold for my HP&nbsp;Pavilion.<br /><br /><br />Related discussion:<ul><li>Yes, I&nbsp;could go through the house and unplug everything that's not in use.&nbsp; My washing machine, television, stereo, cell phone chargers, etc.&nbsp; However some of those things don't like being unplugged.&nbsp; My printer loses its settings if I unplug it.&nbsp; My stereo system has to be reconfigured.&nbsp; My cell phone charger won't lose any data but it's a pain to get behind the nightstand and mess with the wires.&nbsp; It's really bad if I forget to plug in my alarm clock before I&nbsp;go to bed.&nbsp; I used to unplug everything when I left on vacation for a few days but no longer; it's just too much work.</li><li>No, not every rice cooker and toaster oven contains FDE&nbsp;cycle-based electronics.&nbsp; Some of them are quite simple, and when they're off, they're truly off.&nbsp; However an increasing number of electronics do remain on all the time as they become more programmable, sophisticated, and interactive to meet customers' demands.</li><li>BOINC&nbsp;is the most popular distributed computing project but there are many others.&nbsp; Distributed.net comes to mind.&nbsp; BOINC&nbsp;is now the engine behind many projects including the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), the World Community Grid (healthier rice, cures for diseases, and others), and climateprediction.net (global weather prediction).</li></ul>"

"event","I grew up in the Sacramento area near where two rivers join up.  As a result, rafting is popular there, especially in the hot months of July and August.  There were several companies that offered rubber rafts you could rent for the day.  Each has a distinguishing serial number and you checked them out before your trip, and when you're done, you return it.

Of course since not everyone in the county would be renting a raft, each store had a supply equivalent to the amount of business they expected to get.  On Independence Day (Fourth of July) you needed to get there early or they would run out, and you would have to either go elsewhere or wait until someone returns their raft from yesterday.

Some people bought their own rafts, which are theirs forever, and each of those has at least a serial number that comes from the manufacturer (in case there is a recall).  We'll come back to this special case in ""static IP addresses"" below.


The same is true of IP (Internet Protocol) addresses.  Your ISP or Internet Service Provider has a limited supply of them and does not expect everyone to be using them at once, but they issue these numbered IP addresses as needed, and when your computer signs off for the day, the address is returned to the pool.  Though your ISP may make an attempt to issue you the same IP address each day, it's not guaranteed.  Since there are 4,228,250,625 (255^4) addresses but there are far more computers, cell phones, and other Internet-connected devices out there, dynamic IP addresses are one way of maintaining that pool, and most IP addresses are therefore checked out or ""rented"" as needed.  If you doubt that there are that many devices connected to the Internet, consider that each computer has an IP address, each cell phone has an address, every printer has an address, every web site has at least one address, every PDA, every barcode scanner, every cash register, every router (routers manage Internet traffic in and out of homes and businesses), and since some of these devices have more than one IP (common with virtualization technology) it multiplies very quickly.  Yahoo and Google each have millions of computers, and that's in the data center alone.


Imagine, if you will, that you could track every rubber raft by its serial number.  If a raft was present at the scene of a crime, you could find out who the owner is, and if it's rented, a search warrant may be necessary to determine who had rented the raft at that time, pegging them as a suspect (still inconclusive because that person may have let someone else borrow it, the raft might have been stolen and then returned, etc.).  The person who has that raft now is often not who you're looking for.  For privacy reasons, the raft company won't open their records without a warrant.  

No imagination is necessary for IP addresses -- they are traceable.  Every web site you visit and every email you send causes the IP to be logged.  The ISP will turn over information about who used the IP for a given time, but only with a warrant.

A ""static IP"" (address) is owned.  A business may buy a block of IP addresses, making activity traceable back to that business, but not necessarily to a person.  Those IPs are ""rented"" to each employee.


In fraud investigations, an IP address might be traced back to a particular Internet cafe where a cell of scammers operate from, and a police raid can shut the business down.  Though we might not know from the IP *who* started the scam, in countries like Nigeria enough fraud activity from one business is enough to arrest everyone inside on suspicion of fraud.

If you use Jobfox's traceable resumes, it uses IP addresses to.  It's enough to determine what company opened the resume if that employee is not working from home, but the user is still ""renting"" the IP.  If you want to know who opened it, you'll still have to use conventional means.


To finish the analogy, a ""private IP"" address would be if you were to take one of those rubber rafts, number a bunch of smaller rafts arbitrarily, and put them inside the bigger raft.  Those numbers are only meaningful to the issuer, they are not traceable on the Internet.  ...but since they are inside a bigger raft that *is* traceable, the trace can find the issuer.  To trace back any further than the issuer, a warrant would be required to make the issuer determine who is responsible.  Private IPs are the other way that we overcome the 4,228,250,625 device limit.  One Internet-trackable IP address may be used for millions of devices (and for the geeks, that calculation is based on having both a 10.x.x.x network and a 192.168.x.x network).

So the next time a web site warns you that ""your IP has been logged!"" just remember that for most of us, without a warrant they can only go so far and if you haven't done anything illegal, you're still essentially anonymous.

If any more granular tracking were available to the public, the American Civil Liberties Union would put a stop to it..."

"event","I have a relative (an in-law actually) who is in prison right now.  All that I'll say about him is that he was convicted of a white collar crime in an act of kindness not understood by California law.

This post is not about him but about the system.  Some jails are called correctional facilities, implying that somehow the people in prison are corrected, changed, and rehabilitated.  That a court would determine the length of the sentence seems strange -- only a behavioral specialist would be able to tell whether a convict has been ""corrected.""  As far as I can tell, there is no difference between a jail and a correctional facility.  These facilities merely put away those people from the public eye.  When a crime becomes too severe the punishment increases, resolving the issue not in a way that is more effective but merely burying the problem by hiding the people convicted of those crimes for longer periods of time.

...and now the inevitable has happened.  Prisons are impacted, and rather than find more effective ways to ""correct"" these people, they're being released early.  

The cure to this is education.  Education of behavioral specialists as to how to measure success and recommend early release.  Education of convicts as to ways to resolve issues without illegal and immoral acts.  Education of the public about situations that need better methods of resolution than what might force someone to commit a crime.  Crime prevention.  etc.

Jails only hide the problem."

"event","Last night after turning off the Oscars and putting my daughter to bed, I told my wife I would start the bills for the week and get a few other things done that I hadn't had the opportunity to finish earlier in the weekend.

One of the latter projects was my ongoing project to make Skype my long distance carrier.  That's worth its own blog entry (I know, this blog is a mishmash of all kinds of stuff, isn't it??), but as part of this project I needed to modify a setting on my Netgear WGT624v4 wireless router.  ...and hit the Apply button.  (the fun begins)  The router then proceeded to reboot... and didn't come back.  So I poked around a bit, and discovered it had changed its IP address.

One of the router instructions once told me that if for some reason I screw something up, I should be able to access it on 192.168.1.1 from a machine hard-wired into port 1 of the router.  I can't remember whether this one had that feature or not, but I found it wouldn't respond to my password.  So I tried the default, and it accepted it.  All of my settings had been erased.  I hadn't made a backup of my settings, which is kind of a drag, so I started manually inputting the settings.  ...and found that every time I changed something, the setting changed back again. 

I was up until 1 a.m. last night:
* I clicked on the ""Reset to Factory Defaults"" button in the configuration screen.  No change, and it still wouldn't hold any of my settings.
* I bypassed the router and downloaded new firmware.  The firmware took, but the settings still stayed at factory defaults no matter what I did.
* I pressed and held the reset button on the actual device, but my settings still wouldn't hold.
* I thought maybe I was entering something invalid so I changed something that couldn't possibly be invalid -- the SSID, and later the admin password.  Even those wouldn't hold.

Finally, I found this thread.  
http://forum1.netgear.com/showthread.php?t=34680

As of today, there are four of us all reporting the same symptom, all within a week of each other.  Seems as if the clock struck midnight (almost literally) and all the carriages turned back into pumpkins.  It's almost definitely a problem with the memory chip.  Something shows as invalid, and as a precaution, the router automatically clears the settings and boots with factory defaults.  

Knowing that it was a hardware problem and intending to find out whether this was covered by a warranty, this morning I called tech support.  Someone in India took the call, reciting from his instruction manual what I needed to do to solve the problem.  He was quite confident we could take care of it, despite my insistence that the flash chip or flash controller was no longer writing to memory.  Here's what we did:
* Click on the ""Reset to Factory Defaults"" button in the configuration screen.  No change, and it still wouldn't hold any of my settings.
* Update the firmware -- no, I already have the most recent version.
* Press and hold the reset button on the actual device, but my settings still wouldn't hold.
* He thought maybe I was entering something invalid so he had me change something that couldn't possibly be invalid -- the SSID.  Even that wouldn't hold.
* Turn off SSID broadcast and turn it back on again (which I wouldn't have thought would make a difference but it's certainly an original idea).  Of course, the act of turning it off and saving settings turned it back on again.

So he transferred me to a senior technician.  The senior technician had notes on what I'd told the first tech, but asked me to:
* Click on the ""Reset to Factory Defaults"" button in the configuration screen.  No change, and it still wouldn't hold any of my settings.
* Update the firmware -- no, I already have the most recent version.
* Press and hold the reset button on the actual device, but my settings still wouldn't hold.
* He thought maybe I was entering something invalid so he had me change something that couldn't possibly be invalid -- the SSID.  Even that wouldn't hold.

This is getting old fast.  It's reassuring that I, a lowly customer, seem to be doing the same that a ""senior technician"" would try.  If I could generate the RMA number myself I would have done that too.  

In the end (and after 1.5 hours on the phone), he decided that there must be something wrong with the hardware!  (didn't I say that about 4 paragraphs ago?) but more importantly, he let me exchange it for free.  Oh, but unless I want to pay extra, I'll have to be out a router for 1-2 weeks.

I know that hardware companies have hired people to make sure that only truly defective products are returned.  They're the gatekeepers that get to decide whether the company is going to pay for replacement equipment and refurbishment or recycling costs.  I just wish I could call and give them some kind of code that proves I've already tried everything.  Let me have those 4 hours of my life back!!!


Ugh.  Well, at least one computer can still get online, but I'm out a firewall, I no longer have Wifi, and I need to manually have my computer initialize my DSL connection for now.

Still, I wonder if the above linked thread continues to grow, what will Netgear do about it?  Have the four of us stumbled on a flaw in the design?"

"event","<div class=""entry-content""><div class=""entry-body""><p>Valentines Day is just over a month away. If you want an inexpensive but thoughtful and unique Valentine gift, you should start thinking about it now. I'm speaking of the U.S. Postal Service's Valentine Remailing Program. Here's what you do:</p>  <p>1. Sign your Valentine card, seal it up, address it to yourself, and add appropriate postage (just as if you were mailing it from the post office you'll pick in step 3 below).<br /> 2.  Put that envelope in a bigger envelope (two postage stamps might be required for this one), and seal it up.<br /> 3.  Read <a href=""http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2003/pr03_010.pdf"">this press release</a> and decide where you want your valentine to be from. Loveland, Colorado is the most popular one, but you need to get that in the mail by tomorrow because of the high demand. I personally verified that Romance, AR is still participating in the program for 2009, they said their program will be running February 1-14 so you've got some time.<br /> 4.  Address it per the instructions in the press release.</p>  <p>When the Valentine arrives, it will be hand-cancelled, carrying a special Valentines Day postmark in red. Loveland's usually reads &quot;With Love From Loveland, CO&quot; and has an additional picture in it, but each has their own picturesque postmark which changes annually.</p>  <p>Frequently asked questions:<br /> Q:  Do I have to enclose anything in the outer envelope besides my self-addressed, stamped card?  Like payment for the service?<br /> A: No. The post offices get local volunteers to help out. Your postage stamps to get the valentine there and back are payment enough.</p>  <p>Q:  My Valentine card is red.  Will the postmark be readable?<br /> A:  For red envelopes they use black ink.  The postmark is still very noticeable.</p>  <p>Q:  There are so many; which do I choose?<br /> A: I prefer not to use Loveland because they get inundated, but when I first learned of the service they did deliver on time despite the flood of cards they get every year for the service. As far as I can tell there's no particular advantage to using Loveland, CO over Valentine, TX or Juliette, GA; if anything, you'll appear to be resourceful by not picking Loveland. If you want to know what the postmark will look like, call the numbers in the press release and ask each post office to describe this year's postmark. The press release is from 2003 and describes only the 2003 postmark, not 2009's.</p>  <p>Q:  When should I mail it?<br /> A: If you want it back by Valentines Day, mail it ASAP. Cards going through Loveland need to be postmarked by January 14 to guarantee February 14 delivery; others are less strict.</p>  <p>Q: My Valentine is going to be bulky, e.g. it's a singing card with electronics inside or contains a gift card. Will they have any trouble processing it?<br /> A: The extra weight might require another postage stamp on the inner envelope, but each card will be hand-cancelled so it shouldn't get damaged by automatic machines. You should call the post office using phone numbers in the <a href=""http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2003/pr03_010.pdf"">press release</a> to make sure.</p>  <p>Q:  I want to include a letter/pictures/gift certificate.<br /> A: The extra weight might require a second postage stamp on both envelopes. Usually you'll need two postage stamps on large envelopes anyway so the outer envelope probably still won't need a third envelope. There's a postage calculator at usps.com which takes envelope sizes and weight into account.</p></div></div>"

"event","Where will projector technology be taking us?  Few of the projectors out there completely meet the needs.  We all muddle through with corporate projectors and plan to spend the first 15 minutes trying to negotiate screen resolutions and driver settings to make it work, hoping to have it working before the meeting starts.  It's as if the projector manufacturers aren't listening, or at least that the employers aren't buying new equipment.  So I'll volunteer some requirements that they can use.

Use case 1:

Someone in sales or marketing frequently goes to customer sites to give presentations.  That may be slides or live animated demos.  He or she doesn't want to bring a lot of extra equipment or wires, but often the customer doesn't have a projector of their own.  It has to be easy to connect to -- the OS has to recognize it as a projector and be able to project *any* application, just like a traditional projector does today.

This projector needs to be ultra-portable, and preferably wireless.  It can be paired with a single computer and that won't change often.  If it's not built into the laptop itself, it can be a small portable device.  A power cord is probably okay.  Battery-operated would be fantastic, but given it would add undesired weight maybe we can hold off on that.  It usually won't be used for longer than 2-3 hours at a time.

Use case 2:

Everyone in the office has a laptop with 802.11 support, many of them have Bluetooth support too.  Sometimes it's Windows, sometimes Mac or Linux, and sometimes a mixture of all of these.  They're doing away with desktops entirely.  Every time there's a meeting, everyone brings in their portable computer (laptop, smartphone, or whatever) into a meeting room and they may take turns projecting things.  

This projector does not have the 1:1 relationship that was in case 1.  Control needs to be transferred around at will, preferably without the use of cables.  This projector might be a permanent fixture in a meeting room or something that could easily be transported to a hotel meeting room and used for the entire day.  The meeting moderator should be able to decide who will project.

"event","The year was 2004.  Microsoft was planning its next generation Windows.  There were many requests for this release, many of them stemming from things that customers said could be improved in Windows XP.

End-user requests:
* Security -- crooks are getting smarter about how they trick people into running a program, or trick other programs into running applications they believe they should trust.  Trust is not enough; we need a way to make sure a program is what it claims to be.
* Easy to use -- Computers needs to be more intuitive.  That means easier to use, but also easier to maintain, and generally prettier -- more multimedia
* Boot times -- it takes too long to start up.  When I turn it on, I want it on as fast as I turn on my TV.

Hardware vendor requests:
* Manufacturers of accessories don't want to make new drivers for devices they stopped selling 3-4 years ago, but they'll be happy to update the latest devices.  Since most accessories are purchased when the computer is new, this shouldn't be a problem for most users.

Microsoft requests:
* Microsoft is tired of being blamed for other people's drivers.  It's time to exert some tests on those drivers and make it clear to the user who is to blame when something goes wrong.
* Close partnership with software companies has proven to be an asset.  Let's encourage all software partners to enter in an agreement with Microsoft to have their brand name be trusted by the operating system when it tries to launch.  Anyone else will receive a warning box.  I mean, face it -- Microsoft can only vouch for the safety of software that it knows about.  Meeting all of Microsoft's standards might require a few changes to the existing software.

There are many other improvements and requests that were acted upon for the Vista release, but these are the primary ones I'll comment on for now.



Solution #1 (security):  Anything we don't know about, let's ask the user if it's okay.  I mean, we can't vouch for software we don't know about, so it will be the user's responsibility if something goes wrong.  At least then they'll know what was trying to execute.  Everything we know about and trust will be trusted by Microsoft or signed by Microsoft.  That should cover most software.

Problem #1:  A given software stack consists of an average of 8 separate applications, at least 4 of which are included with the software but not made by the same vendor, and typically at least one of which is a virtually unknown package that is irreplaceable but no one else uses it.  That means if even one of the eight is unknown to Microsoft, they'll receive a warning dialogue box.  Those are pretty good odds; there are a lot of small software companies that have never needed to speak with Microsoft before or can't afford the partner program enrollment fees.

---

Solution #2 (easy to use, more multimedia):  Even a toddler can use Windows XP, though it takes some getting used to if you've never used any of the previous versions of Windows.  To address this, error messages were dumbed down, additional graphics effects that are commonplace in today's graphics hardware are used in even simple operations, and more features were added to make the GUI ""feel"" new.  The system also is now self-maintaining.

Problem #2:  Of course, all of those additional effects use memory and processing power, raising the bar for minimum and even recommended system requirements.  Also the ""dumbed down"" error messages make the machine more difficult to support -- less information is provided to the user and therefore less is passed onto a technician on the phone trying to resolve the issue.  Often there are ways to get additional information for the technician, but finding it isn't intuitive to the user.

---

Solution #3 (boot times):  By making more use of the Windows XP Hibernate feature, the system can be up and running within seconds.  Occasionally they will still need to completely reboot, but most of the time they'll never need to exit all of their programs and shut down.

Problem #3:  Hibernate requires that hardware manufacturers understand and write to certain power management specifications.  For example, though the machine is not turned off, network connections still have to be severed, and they need to be restored quickly when the system wakes up.  Some hardware manufacturers have never needed to deal with this problem, others try very hard to write to the spec and still manage to problems.  Worse, software never expects to be interrupted, so the software itself may not let go of a device and allow it to shut down safely.  The result is a tangled mess of dumbed down error messages and a whole lot of finger pointing.

---

Solution #4 (support for old devices):  It's true that most users buy everything they need in one go, finance the whole thing, and buy the machine as a big package.  They may not have an electronics store nearby.  Those that don't have compatible devices can always buy a new computer with all new hardware.  That's definitely going to work.

Problem #4:  Migrating data to a new machine is a pain.  Most people would rather keep their existing computer, especially since they can see there was nothing wrong with it when they ran Windows XP.  Vista becomes the new scapegoat, not Epson, not Creative Labs, not any of the hardware vendors that didn't bother to write drivers for their old devices.

---

Solution #5 (OS reliability):  Most of the time when the computer freezes it's a driver problem.  ...but Windows XP doesn't usually make that clear.  Better error message reporting will make it clear whose software created the problem, and therefore who to call to have it resolved.

Problem #5:  ""Everything was fine until I tried to move to Vista"" ""Vista doesn't support my hardware""   Maybe no one is faulting Vista for the errors themselves any more, but they're certainly faulting Vista for being different from Windows XP.  ""In Windows XP, everything was working fine"" users claim, ""Now I have to buy all new equipment.  I wish I could go back to Windows XP.""

---

Solution #6 (close partnerships with major vendors):  This is similar to the solution to our first request for improvements.  Microsoft realizes that code quality programs (including code security) emerges from a relationship of trust with software companies.  

Problem #6:  Running a partnership program has a cost.  The cost is offset (and more) by the enrollment fees into the partner programs.  This proves to be a deterrent to the software companies.  Though most are trying to address this now, it's only in the most recent version of the product, which requires the customer to purchase an upgrade.

===

In all, Vista has tried to satisfy everybody and ended up creating new problems for the end-users, giving it a bad reputation.  Many customers now pay extra to have Vista removed and Windows XP installed.

As for me... Macintosh is looking very attractive for my next major upgrade, and there's nothing wrong with continuing to use Windows XP for a few more years."

"event","When I&nbsp;first found Overstock, they were the online Big Lots.&nbsp; Same concept -- somebody overproduced and now the excess is available for dimes if not pennies on the dollar.&nbsp; The primary benefit to manufacturers is that they can get rid of inventory and make room for newer products even though it's at a loss.&nbsp; Overstock/Big Lots can mark it up a bit and it's still savings for the buyer.

Unlike Big Lots, Overstock's selection was far more broad and less of the typical consumer goods.&nbsp; Sure you can get sheets and pillows at either one, but you'll never find a wireless router at Big Lots (market is too narrow for a regional store) nor will you find paper plates at Overstock (the item is so cheap that shipping would eat up the savings).&nbsp; Once again, the online business model allows for products with narrow appeal to be sold across the entire nation.&nbsp; Maybe you only sell two banjo CDs in San Jose but across the whole nation it's hundreds, which is significant.

Overstock's business model has changed, but their marketing message has not.&nbsp; A TomTom 920 GPS can be purchased at Fry's for $200-250, but on Overstock they claim it retails for $500, making $395 a bargain (until you realize it's overpriced).&nbsp; Overstock is now just like Amazon.com.&nbsp; They have clearance sales every week just like they used to but I&nbsp;don't care how much discount is claimed, it's no bargain.


If I had to guess, Overstock's attempt to maintain variety has either led them to the standard retail business or they've got an inventory problem of their own.&nbsp; If they truly are still trying to sell GPS&nbsp;units that were worth $500 when they bought them, they've been sitting on a shelf for at least a year and need to be cleared out to remain competitive."

"event","One of the basic macroeconomic philosophies is that when there isn't enough business for all companies within that industry to survive, when one company fails, the remaining business gets shifted to competitors.&nbsp; Those customers will go to the competitors who best address the customers' needs.&nbsp; When there are too many customers for a company to handle, a market opportunity is created for an additional competitor who can serve the market.

The notion of bailing out failed automotive and financial companies circumvents that common sense.&nbsp; Yes, it is a short-term inconvenience for some people, loans may need to change hands, and those who can't pay their mortgage need to find another way to pay their bills.&nbsp; The rental market is hot right now because no one can get a loan.&nbsp; Failure of large employers in Detroit will send people looking for new opportunities.&nbsp; 

Keeping these companies alive slows and prevents the corrective processes that should take place to put everything back on track."

"event","A topic covered intensely in my MBA studies is that a company who was engineered in the past and does not track the needs of their customers will stay in the past.&nbsp; A perfect example of this is Sears Photography.

When I&nbsp;was a kid, Sears Photography was the place everyone went for pictures at important milestones of the family.&nbsp; You went there, you took a number, and when you were called, they would take lots and lots of pictures, on at least two different backgrounds.&nbsp; They had ways to keep the kids entertained and smiling, they had props, sometimes they did a little makeup job if it was necessary, and of *course* they had picture packages.&nbsp; This was really the *only*&nbsp;way you could get pictures of your family that were anything besides the standard 4x6 size.&nbsp; Wallets, 8x10s, etc.&nbsp; ...and people were willing to pay a premium to get it.&nbsp; Weeks after your picture was taken, you would go back and choose which photos you liked best.&nbsp; Weeks after that you could pick up your picture package -- a combination of wallets, 5x7's, 8x10's, etc. that you could send to all of your friends and relatives.

Today, just about every inkjet printer you buy is capable of printing on glossy paper, giving it a photographic look.&nbsp; You can buy the blank paper at Costco, and for very little money you can buy Photoshop Elements (a simpler and less expensive version than what professional photographers use) to resize the picture, remove redeye, and you can even give grandma a youthful appearance by adjusting the lighting and removing wrinkles.&nbsp; 

I'm happy to report that Sears has embraced this technology!&nbsp; They have their own printers, and now you can bring home your photos the same day.&nbsp; They use software similar to Photoshop to add special effects, they can make it into Christmas cards, etc.&nbsp; It's a very convenient, fast service.&nbsp; 

Just like the good ol' days, the sitting fee is a fair amount but really just covers costs.&nbsp; The real money to be made is in the picture packages.&nbsp; Wallets, 8x10s, and larger than 8x10 for those who really want it.&nbsp; They can even have a rug made that looks just like your picture!&nbsp; But do you want the original negative?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want the original digital file photograph?&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, well that will cost you!&nbsp;&nbsp;Sears doesn't want you making photos on your own, they want you to buy a picture package.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Only thing is... who wants a huge rug with their picture on it?&nbsp;&nbsp;How many big pictures do you need?&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, can't you do this at home yourself for far less??&nbsp; I've got a scanner.&nbsp; Not quite as sharp as the original but I&nbsp;don't need it to be.

People who don't want to mess with the tripod on a timer and don't have access to photo software still come to Sears, but in most families there's at least one person who would gladly print it for them on their home printer.&nbsp; The inkjet photos fade faster than pictures from the days of yore, but that's why you keep the original files around so you can print more for those family tree researchers.&nbsp; Everyone else wants a current photo.&nbsp; The huge lighting umbrellas are intimidating especially to kids, and they're not really necessary -- digital photography has advanced to the point that you can get a nice photo from a standard flash bulb, and the rest can be touched up digitally on a computer screen.

The advantage to Sears is that a trained professional can pose everyone, use their backdrops and props, and take a nice family photo.&nbsp; Charging a premium for the original doesn't really slow anyone down from creating their own picture packages; Photoshop will print wallets as well as it does 8x10's, you just need the blank paper and a pair of scissors.&nbsp; I would happily pay a little more than I&nbsp;pay for the 8x10 I&nbsp;buy now to get the original digital photo.&nbsp; Many people will happily pay a bit for the photo enhancements and specialty photo products too.&nbsp; The photo studio need not be intimidating; a decently-lit room will be captured well with the right equipment, and our local Sears studio seems to have the right equipment already.&nbsp; Backdrops are hard to do too on a computer; that's worth the Sears trip.

...but while Sears continues to subscribe to the old package-based pricing and traditional thought around lighting umbrellas that discourage parents, they'll continue to be as empty as the one we visit in Cupertino from time to time:&nbsp; You never need to take a number, you almost don't need an appointment.&nbsp;


Why do I&nbsp;post this here instead of sending it to Sears?&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear need here for some market research and standard product management practices.&nbsp; That's what product managers do -- they listen to the customers, and they tell the company what the customer will buy.&nbsp; There is clear need for Sears to listen to their customers, but not just Sears; all of us:
*&nbsp;Encyclopedia Brittanica remained in the paper-bound encyclopedia business long after Compton's started selling electronic encyclopedias for a tiny fraction of the cost.&nbsp; 
*&nbsp;Intel transformed the silicon industry into one based on computing *solutions* and full productivity while AMD&nbsp;continued to focus on manufacturing and selling bare silicon chips.&nbsp; 
* Ford and GM&nbsp;have realized too late that a car's total cost of ownership (maintenance, repair, fuel, customers' time)&nbsp;matters to customers more than its horsepower and are in danger of going out of business while Honda and Toyota continue to be the best-selling brands in the industry because they realized this long ago.

A company that does not continuously listen to its customers misses the opportunity to achieve the excellence needed to keep those customers.&nbsp; Businesses must constantly change to keep up with the market.&nbsp; A company that starts researching and building a product today that is sold in three years may have been able to sell that product today, but if adjustments aren't made over the course of the next three years, those customers won't buy in three years."

"event","I wrote this to my wife, logging exactly what &quot;her daughter&quot; had been doing to me all day (she's out of town on family business), but I decided it was such an interesting day, it's worth a blog post.&nbsp; Background, Sophia is my 2-year-old, and she was recently potty-trained:

Sophia did very well in church, and for the most part stayed put throughout the 1.5 hour service.&nbsp; We went home, she napped in the car for an hour (like I told you), and we had lunch.

Now... after lunch, she went pee pee again and we got in the car to go to the store and other errands.&nbsp; First thing I noticed was my gas light, and GasBuddy confirmed that Costco had an incredible rate as usual.&nbsp; I figured since she just went, she can probably sit still long enough to wait through the gas line; we'll listen to some music and play with toys.&nbsp; 
 

On the way there I hand her a little box of flavored water [it's for kids, it has Clifford the Big&nbsp;Red Dog on the outside of it, and made by Hansen's, a brand I trust].&nbsp; Some of it got in her mouth, the rest is all over her shirt.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; ...but when I got to Lawrence and Kifer, &quot;pee pee poo poo!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;But Sophia, you just went.&nbsp; You have to go again?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;(pause...) yes.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Okay Sophia.&nbsp; Let's do pee pee poo poo then.&quot;&nbsp; Miraculously, I got a parking spot right in front of the entrance.&nbsp; I unstrapped her, I brought in the diaper bag, I flashed my card, I weaved among all the Sunday afternoon shoppers and we went to the far corner next to the pharmacy for the restrooms, I put her on the seat and took off her pants and underwear.&nbsp; Pause... she reached for the toilet paper.&nbsp; &quot;Sophia, did you go pee pee poo poo?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;No.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Are you done?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Yes!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;...Sophia&quot; (I gave her a stern look)&nbsp; &quot;You said you had to go pee pee.&quot;&nbsp; She starts to pout.&nbsp; &quot;Okay.&nbsp; Let's get you up.&quot;&nbsp; (I put the pants back on her) &quot;you make daddy angry when you say you have to go pee pee and you don't pee pee.&quot;&nbsp; 
 
So, I weaved among the Sunday shoppers again, back out to the exit.&nbsp; Back to the car.&nbsp; I get in line.&nbsp; After about 10 minutes, she's bored.&nbsp; &quot;Pee pee poo poo.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;No, Sophia.&nbsp; We were just there.&nbsp; You can't go again.&nbsp; We just tried.&nbsp; You have to wait.&quot;&nbsp; She pouts.&nbsp; She's on the virge of crying.&nbsp; I hand her the sheep guy, but she swats it away.&nbsp; I hand her night night guy, but she swats at him too.&nbsp; &quot;Do you want to listen to some music?&quot;&nbsp; Continues to pout.&nbsp; I turn on the music.&nbsp; I hand her the toy car keys.&nbsp; She's happy.&nbsp; Why is everyone passing us?&nbsp; The guy I almost followed into his line is leaving the pump and I'm still three cars back!&nbsp; Turns out I happened to choose the line where one of the pumps isn't working, so it's real slow getting through there.&nbsp; I come out the other side, &quot;Okay, do you have to go pee pee?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Yes.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Okay.&quot;&nbsp; This time, I'm not so lucky.&nbsp; I park out near the tire center next to the gas station and we walk all the way into the entrance.&nbsp; Same drill as before, only this time she did pee pee.&nbsp; She receives high praise.&nbsp; Back in the car again, we head to Safeway.&nbsp; I'm starting to get thirsty and figure she's probably thirsty too.&nbsp; She gets another flavored water box.&nbsp; A little more ends up in her mouth this time.&nbsp; 
 
We got through the checkout before she said &quot;pee pee poo poo&quot;&nbsp; Well, it has been a while, so let's give it a shot.&nbsp; I park the cart outside the restrooms, I bring the diaper bag, and we go in.&nbsp; She does do pee pee.&nbsp; It's a tiny squirt, but she does do it.&nbsp; 
 
First thing in the door at home, she says has to go again.&nbsp; ...but she doesn't really.&nbsp; She likes to play with the toilet paper.&nbsp; I roll it back up again, and I finally get something to drink.&nbsp; While I look up other fun restaurant alternatives we might try for a change, she goes one more time (larger this time), and we get in the car for Red Robin.&nbsp; I didn't think to check her shirt; I assume it's dry by now.
 
I'm pulling out of the driveway, &quot;pee pee poo poo.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;But Sophia!!!&nbsp; You just went!!&quot;&nbsp; She cowers.&nbsp; Well, she still hasn't pooped yet today.&nbsp; Better at home than at the restaurant.&nbsp; So I pull back into the garage and we go in.&nbsp; No, she doesn't have to go.&nbsp; Wants to play with the toilet paper again.&nbsp; I pick her up, and we finally go.
 
She had spaghetti, french fries, and chocolate milk.&nbsp; (the spaghetti did have sauce on it so she had some real vegetables)&nbsp; I scold her a couple of times for throwing crayons and sugar packets on the ground.&nbsp; Halfway through the meal, with her face covered with ketchup, &quot;pee pee poo poo.&quot;&nbsp; Alright.&nbsp; This time, I didn't grab the diaper bag.&nbsp; I figured if there's any doubt about me coming back, they'll see we left our stuff and take that as a sign that we didn't try to weasel out of paying the bill.&nbsp; She does do pee pee, and when I come back, her high chair is gone, replaced with a chair, the table next to us has been cleared, and I find the manager and the hostess glaring at our table.&nbsp; When we come back, I grab the high chair from the table that had just been cleared and replace the chair, strap in Sophia again, and the manager &amp; hostess leave, apparently deciding that I came back after all.&nbsp; Maybe they weren't sure if I was with that other party.&nbsp; 
 
We finish dinner about 15 minutes later.&nbsp; She's bored.&nbsp; &quot;Pee pee poo poo.&quot;&nbsp; I decide to ignore it.&nbsp; She doesn't insist.&nbsp; We shared an ice cream sundae (with her on my lap).&nbsp; 

Still hasn't pooped; I wonder what I could give her that I could mix in the mineral oil without her noticing?&nbsp; While I'm stopped at a light I look it up on my phone.&nbsp; It can be mixed in &quot;anything&quot; but they suggest a little at a time in something flavorful... see just how much you can get into the drink before the toddler notices. Mineral oil is given when the toddler is holding back; it acts to remove all control over pooping so that they try to poop more often and push it out before the laxative effect kicks in.&nbsp; Great, just what she needs before bed time.&nbsp; I decide to skip it for today.
 
First thing in the door she decides to take off all her clothes, mentioning her shirt is wet (I had mopped it up when we got to Safeway but I check and yes it's still damp).&nbsp; So we play games on the computer for a few minutes with her naked on my lap, then bath.&nbsp; She said &quot;pee pee poo poo&quot; as I was waiting for the water to warm up, so I turned off the water, and she did pee.&nbsp; I washed her hair with the baby shampoo, a little bit of soap got in her eyes and she screamed about it (&quot;gentle, no tears&quot; my ass - that clearly stung).&nbsp; ...but as soon as I get her out of the tub and she spots the toothbrush, all is forgiven.&nbsp; We dry hair, read bedtime stories, and she went to sleep very quickly.&nbsp; It was warm in the house, so I had turned up her fan and loosely draped the blanket over her legs telling her &quot;the blanket is here if you get too cold.&quot;
 

...and as I sit here, I start to wonder, how is it that she went pee so much, so often, and only had 1&frac12; flavored water boxes?&nbsp; Just what did they do to that water to flavor it, does that make it go straight through her?&nbsp; Oh well, it's late.&nbsp; Time for bed."

 from The Wall Street Journal
 
 
 Sept. 19, 2008
 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily halted short selling of 799 financial stocks as part of a coordinated effort with the U.K.'s markets regulator aimed at strengthening investor confidence. The short-selling ban, which is effective immediately, is set to last for 10 days, but could be extended for up to 30 days.

---

Commentary -- The SEC&nbsp;would have been better off doing nothing at all.&nbsp; Now that everyone pretty much knows the economy is in poor shape, it makes no sense to bet that companies will be profitable.&nbsp; The only way to make money is then to bet on a company's failure (short selling).&nbsp; In time, short selling would eventually make other entities profitable enough to level out the economic downturn.&nbsp; By artificially prohibiting short selling, the SEC&nbsp;allows investor confidence to continue to fall, and panic continues.&nbsp; By allowing short selling to continue, they would allow the U.S. economy's very design to kick in and protect itself.

Fasten your seat belts, we're in for a rough ride."

"event","Has anyone else noticed that the only substance in McCain-Palin's campaign is the negativism directed at Obama?&nbsp; There's nothing wrong with negativism, unless it's a smokescreen to hide behind because you have no substance of your own.&nbsp; By taking Obama quotes out of context, McCain and Palin can make it seem like Obama is making radical changes to the government's course, and the McCain-Palin campaign's change is essentially motherhood and apple pie.&nbsp; Get the government back on the right track, cut taxes, fix the oil problem, take away the &quot;golden parachute&quot; of CEOs, etc.&nbsp; ...but the *how* on each of these issues is completely missing.&nbsp; I agree with the Obama camp that says the overall McCain philosophy is not that much different from Bush, with specific examples.&nbsp; McCain might rebut that Bush's approach was broken whereas his is not.&nbsp; ...and he would be exactly that specific.

It amazes me to hear McCain talk about change, then go to his web site and find he advocates little change at all.&nbsp; ...and that's by design.&nbsp; It's to attract people who are conservative and don't want the government's philosophies to change, yet who realize the GWB administration made some mistakes that snowballed.&nbsp; By having McCain campaign that he's not going to make that mistake, he has won 50% of the U.S. population.

It's my view that the sort of conservative changes that McCain and Palin want will not fix the economy.&nbsp; This morning Wall Street took a severe plunge, the worst since September 11, 2001.&nbsp; Palin was saying this morning that it's time to take control over Wall Street, that Wall Street regulators must have been asleep at the switch.&nbsp; ...yet, she failed to explain what Wall Street regulators missed or what she and McCain would do to fix it.&nbsp; 

Obama is not afraid to make radical changes.&nbsp; It seems about 50% of the population are opposed to radical change, perhaps thinking that we just need to restore the economy to its state before 9/11 when all was fine and dandy.&nbsp; A lot has changed since then that no amount of experience can provide.&nbsp; ...but beyond that, remember that the President relies on his advisors, his cabinet.&nbsp; That's where we need the expertise.&nbsp; I trust Obama to ask his advisors to investigate how to do things very differently.&nbsp; He's a senator, he knows how government works, but he hasn't grown as accustomed to DC&nbsp;policies and procedures as McCain, and therefore has fewer preconceived notions about how to &quot;fix&quot; the economy.


Finally, I worry about McCain's age.&nbsp; He needs to get through at least 4 years, and if he makes it that far, he might need to make it another 4.&nbsp; Palin is a self-admitted soccer mom, with comparatively little experience of how government works in the continental U.S.&nbsp; I have far fewer qualms about Hillary Clinton becoming president than I do about Palin -- I don't object to a female president.&nbsp; Just... not her.&nbsp; Please."

"event","As my 2-year-old daughter gets increasingly interested in the computer and I buy her educational software for her to use, I'm finding she would benefit from having her own login and own desktop in Windows XP.  One that:
1.  Doesn't bother taking time to load the OpenOffice.org tray icon, Quicken reminder icon, or any of the other programs I use regularly.
2.  Doesn't contain a Start Menu that's full of such useless (for a 2-year-old anyway) program groups like the StartUp group, Accessories, Wireshark, Shutterfly, Sony Vegas Studio Platinum, etc.  It just has the programs she would use.
3.  Doesn't require the ability to read.  The bright, colorful icons she looks for should stand out enough that she can at least point to what she wants (until she learns to use a mouse herself).
4.  Is easy for parents to alter and administrate, without granting her account administrative rights, installing the application, and then removing administrative rights.
5.  Doesn't install her icons on everyone else's desktop.  I've got enough icons on my desktop as it is, thank you very much, and I think I know my ""AB3's and 12C's""

So I went hunting for Toddler-friendly environments.  There are many applications that will prevent applications from running if she finds them in the Start Menu, disable the power button on the PC, lock out registry modifications, keep her out of web sites she shouldn't have access to, essentially making the computer difficult for her to screw up, but nothing that makes it easier for her to use.  If anything, these applications just prove to be a pain for the parents to administrate.

I tried to do it myself by going into her Desktop folder and deleting the icons she doesn't need, nor we need to operate the computer for her.  That's basically everything except Internet Explorer and the Recycle Bin.  Off to work I went, and a little later I got a call from my wife at home, saying all of her icons had disappeared too.



Has anyone out there found something that is a truly toddler-*friendly* environment?"

"event","Listening to the radio on the way to work this morning, I noticed an alarming trend.  Companies selling insurance to protect people from the high cost of health care, democrats' plans to change the health care system, affordable ""end of life care"" solutions, etc.  ...and yet, I was coming from an appointment with an affordable alternative medicine medicine, a chiropractor who promotes herbs as the best medicine.

So I got to thinking... I choosing alternative medicine in part because I believe it's natural healing that works with the body to help the body self-correct.  Yet insurance companies continue to push treatments that continue to rise in price and often treat symptoms instead of causes, often working against the body, forcing it to do something it wouldn't ordinarily do.  


What if doctors were trained in herbology?  Or what if the FDA regulated herbology and natural treatments, making them viable even for treatments to severe problems?  Traditional doctors and specialists would be forced to lower their rates to compete, we would learn a lot about how the body works, and these alternative treatments would be considered safe.  The patient would have many more choices of treatments.  Natural remedies could no longer be peddled as having ""no interactions,"" ""no side-effects"" and we would learn the true dangers there.

Might alternative medicine be a solution to the ""health care crisis""?"

"event","I've looked through articles titled ""The most efficient SUVs,"" ""The 2008 Hybrid Buyer's Guide,"" and articles about plug-in models that do away with the need for gas almost entirely, and it seems like the auto manufacturer industry just isn't thinking about my needs.&nbsp; The reason for buying a small, compact hybrid is to save the most amount of money.&nbsp; The reason for buying a hybrid SUV is to get the best performance from the vehicle without losing (or gaining!) fuel efficiency.&nbsp; ...and as a regular market research panelist, I was dismayed that in a chart of brands A-Z, not one brand listed my priorities as their top priorities.<br /><br />I'm reminded of ""The car built for Homer"" idea from the Simpsons -- that the auto industry has lost touch with what their customers really want.&nbsp; ...but I'm far from being a Homer Simpson.&nbsp; I consider myself a fairly typical car buyer.&nbsp; I have a young family, which is growing.&nbsp; I'm going to need a bigger car soon.&nbsp; At the moment, I drive a V6 Honda Accord that gets an average of 22mpg or so.&nbsp; My wife drives a Mazda Protege which gets about 30 mpg.&nbsp; My neighbors drive Priuses, which get around 50-60mpg.&nbsp; The bill for my gas card isn't getting any lower, and at San Francisco prices, we're well above the national average for gas prices.&nbsp; <br /><br />Public transportation isn't an option... to drop off my daughter at daycare requires going significantly off of the train, lightrail, and bus routes.<br /><br />So I want a bigger vehicle, but:<br />* I want to decrease my fuel expenses<br />* Safety is very important to me<br />* Reliability is at least as important as safety<br />* The car needs to be comfortable over a 2-hour drive occasionally to one of our familys' homes.<br /><br />In short, I'm looking for an SUV which gets a minimum of 35mpg on city streets, 40 on the highway, and is as reliable as my Honda Accord.&nbsp; I'm willing to give up some acceleration performance to meet this objective, I'm willing to learn a new way of driving, and a tax rebate would be great for offsetting the additional cost of a hybrid.<br /><br />Options:<br />* I live in an area where air conditioning is a must.<br />* Heated seats are nice, but I could live without them.<br />* I have an MP3 player so I don't need a CD changer.<br />* I won't pay more for a GPS because I have my own, just need a place to mount it.<br />* Out of 52 weeks a year, I spent 1 week of that sitting in a dealership waiting for my GM- or Ford-based car to be repaired.&nbsp; I'm reluctant to buy another American branded car, but for significant enough savings and a free rental car I'd be willing to buy American again.&nbsp; Make me pay for that service when I buy the car; I don't care until I'm both inconvenienced *and* have to pay extra for the pleasure of having a working car again.<br />* Anti-lock brakes are a must for safety reasons.<br />* If I needed to plug in my vehicle overnight for the best fuel efficiency, that's fine, but I need to be able to refuel on a long drive (fuel source can be corn oil, gasoline, a quick charge, I don't care so long as it costs less than $0.12 a mile ($4 a gallon / 30 miles per gallon).&nbsp; <br /><br /><i><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; ""Can you wait until 2010?""&nbsp; </i><br /><b>A:</b>&nbsp; No, but I can wait until 2009 if the cost savings are attractive enough.&nbsp; I'll prepay (thus preventing me from buying a competing car) if you send me gas discounts.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; In 2010 you might be able to convince me to buy another new car because at that point my Accord will probably be too expensive to drive.<br /><br /><i><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; ""New or used?""<br /></i><b>A:</b>&nbsp; I've been very, very pleased with my used Honda Accord and would buy used again for the savings.&nbsp; ...but I realize that a used SUV as efficient as the Toyota Prius probably won't happen until 2011 or 2012.&nbsp; At this point, I'd rather pay once at the dealership than repeatedly at the pump.&nbsp; ...but my new car money is invested and I'm hoping the interest will offset the crazy gas prices.<br /><br /><i><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; ""But it needs to be stylish, right?""</i><br /><b>A:</b>&nbsp; Absolutely positively NOT.&nbsp; Fine, make it aerodynamic if that saves me money on the total cost of ownership.&nbsp; Make it safe, make it inexpensive, and I never again want a car where I have to visit the dealership every month.&nbsp; Doesn't have to be hip, doesn't have to be cool, it can even be bright orange.<br /><br /><i><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; Does it need to be roomy?</i><br /><b>A:</b>&nbsp; My wife thinks that roomy means an SUV, but I can be convinced otherwise.&nbsp; It needs to have cargo space.&nbsp; To transport a baby for an overnight trip, I need a port-a-crib, a suitcase full of extra formula, diapers, bedding (""so the baby will feel at home""), a high chair or booster seat, and a stroller.&nbsp; If I become a father of two, I'll need room for a double-stroller and even more diapers.&nbsp; So cargo space is the priority here, not SUV stylings or ruggedness.<br /><br /><i><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; What color should it be?</i><br /><b>A:</b>&nbsp; Honestly!&nbsp; What is it with car salesmen asking first thing, ""what color do you want?""&nbsp; Sheesh; make it orange and purple for all I care.&nbsp; I'll learn to love whatever it is.&nbsp; My favorite colors are dark blue and dark green, but color doesn't matter that much when I'm choosing a car.&nbsp; Puke yellow might be a turnoff.<br /><br /><i><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; What about automatic breaking, automatic swerving, cars that ""duck"" on a sudden stop...</i><br /><b>A:</b>&nbsp; Though I admit ABS is a must-have, and you could convince me to pay a little more for safety features like those (especially if I get an insurance discount!) I consider myself a good driver who doesn't really need those things.&nbsp; <br /><br /><i><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; What else matters to you?&nbsp; Anything related to the ""personality"" of the brand or vehicle?</i><br /><b>A:</b>&nbsp; ""Green"" is key, and not the color:&nbsp; the price of everything is going up because of gas prices.&nbsp; I'm probably not like most people here in that I'm willing to pay a little more for reasons of helping the greater good.&nbsp; If I can decrease the demand for gas just a little by filling up less often, that decreases the demand for gas and brings the added cost of everything else a little more under control.&nbsp; I realize my contribution isn't much, but I'm willing to pay a little more for the car that will help me do my part.&nbsp; I'll feel like I get that amount back in the decreased inflation from the cost of&nbsp; postage stamps, a loaf of bread, and a gallon of milk.<br /><br />Reader:&nbsp; Are you like me?"

"event","...also known as F.U.D.&nbsp; It's a very powerful tool, one that plays on our emotions and produces a reaction without any real evidence at all.&nbsp; Take these examples:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; You're trying to decide between buying two different products.&nbsp; Both advertise the features you're looking for, and they are equally priced.&nbsp; ...but one brand is a nationally-recognized brand name.&nbsp; The other is one you've never heard of before.&nbsp; Because you are uncertain as to the off-brand's quality, fear you might not be able to find help if something goes wrong, and doubt that the product is everything that's advertised, you choose the better-known brand name.&nbsp; <br /><br />That's standard practice, and a reasonable line of assumptions.&nbsp; But consider this:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; The off-brand may be a bigger more stable company that doesn't have brand awareness campaigns.&nbsp; This makes them the more stable choice.&nbsp; An example of this is the well-known (in its industry) but comparatively small Red Hat Software compared to the mighty Novell with their competing SUSE products.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; The off-brand may have a higher quality because quality is the basis of how they compete.&nbsp; They can't afford to compete in size or in brand awareness marketing, but they do build a better product.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; AMD vs. Intel.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Sometimes retailers and partners or volunteers are signed up to provide tech support on a far larger scale than even their large competitors.&nbsp; The before mentioned competitions are both examples of this, but I'll site an additional example that's better-known:&nbsp;&nbsp; Satellite dishes and cable companies.&nbsp; (the idea being you usually call your carrier for problems with your satellite dish, not the manufacturer of the satellite dish; allowing the satellite dish company to spend little on technical support; likewise, the same is true for your cable box and satellite receiver -- you contact your service provider for help)<br /><br />...but all of us have been burned at one time or another with an off-brand, which is why conventional wisdom prevails.&nbsp; Chances are, the nationally-recognized brand name is the better product.<br /><br /><br /><br />2.&nbsp; Consider the many email scams running around the Internet.&nbsp; Often the scammer uses the name of a company that they are actually not affiliated with to influence our decisions.&nbsp; Right now there are several scammers pretending to be divisions of the IRS, claiming you need to contact them to facilitate release of your tax rebates.&nbsp; This type of scam is expected to heighten in April when 1040's are due.&nbsp; We fear the IRS, we fear an audit, we fear not getting our tax refund.&nbsp; The scammer sometimes writes with such authority and official-looking ""letterhead"" (far too easy to fake) that we believe them, and we release our bank account numbers, social security numbers, date of birth, etc.&nbsp; Similarly, I've seen victims get threatened with ""we'll report you to the FBI if you don't cooperate"" when both the scammer and the victim are outside of the U.S. and therefore outside of FBI jurisdiction.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.&nbsp; When politicians are mudslinging, they use FUD quite a bit.&nbsp; We've already seen incidences of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama each claiming the other said something to make them a less suitable candidate for the White House.&nbsp; George Bush Sr. vs. Michael Dukakis was a rather famous example of extreme mud-slinging for the Presidential seat.&nbsp; These claims are usually based on quotes taken out of context, half-truths, false assumptions, and sometimes just plain lies.&nbsp; ...but very effective!<br /><br /><br />Franklin D. Roosevelt knew the power of FUD well.&nbsp; He's the one quoted as saying:<br /><br /><small>So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that <b>the only thing we have to fear is fear itself </b>-- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.&nbsp; http://ask.yahoo.com/20010614.html</small><br /><br />...and if you're not familiar with that quote, here's another from Yoda (of Star Wars fame).&nbsp; Though Yoda is a fictional character, the writer of this line from Star Wars Episode I was spot on:<br /><br /><font size=""-1""><b>""Fear</b> is the path to the dark side. <b>Fear</b> leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.""</font><br /><br />In either case, fear is the enemy, and a very powerful tool that is used everywhere -- in product competition, in cons, and in politics.&nbsp; I've turned away salesmen at my door for using FUD tactics to bolster their competing product.&nbsp; I've tried hard to make the products I represent stand on their own merits rather than on competitive FUD (but occasionally must give in by company mandates).&nbsp; I encourage others to do the same.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because FUD is easy to counter.<br /><br />How do we compete with fear?&nbsp; Knowledge!&nbsp; These ploys are successful only when the victim is not knowledgeable enough to know better, or it would take too much time to get the information themselves.&nbsp; Armed with knowledge, it's easy to see who's lying.&nbsp; FUD becomes a liability to the educated buyer, victim, or voter."

"event","When I was a ""partner manager"" at AMD I used to get this weird look from people when I told them I handled partnerships.&nbsp; They clearly didn't understand why it was important to have a formal or even informal relationship between companies.&nbsp; ""Isn't that a marketing function?""&nbsp; ""So that's all you do?""&nbsp; ""Doesn't cooperative development happen without your intervention?""

Now I'm at SpikeSource and I just ran into the perfect example of this:

My company arranged to obtain several licenses of VMWare Workstation.&nbsp; In time, we'll be building virtual appliances and we'll be using our partnership with VMWare to create beautiful things.

So I downloaded Ubuntu JEOS (""Just Enough Operating System"") to run inside VMWare on my poor underpowered laptop &amp; docking station so that I could test out some new software we'd developed.&nbsp; JEOS is developed to be the foundation of virtual appliances; it's *designed* to run inside an engine like VMWare, so I figured it would be a piece of cake.

Issue #1:&nbsp; Ubuntu JEOS has no SCSI support, and by default VMWare creates SCSI hard drive images.&nbsp; So you get the whole thing installed, boot it, and it dies when trying to access the hard drive.&nbsp; After a couple of days of trying on my own, one of our friendly support engineers helped me figure out where I needed to go to create an IDE image.&nbsp; Fine.

Issue #2:&nbsp; Some drivers and utilities installed inside the guest make life a lot easier, so I tried to install that.&nbsp; Well, first of all, the automated installer is designed inside X-Windows.&nbsp; That's not installed in JEOS by default, so you have to do a workaround which fortunately is well-documented.&nbsp; So then I started up the installer, and it detects that JEOS comes with its own VM components.&nbsp; That's great in a way because then I know someone has already compiled and tested those modules.&nbsp; Not so great in that VMWare's installer doesn't know that, and doesn't trust those drivers.&nbsp; Those have to be removed before I can continue.&nbsp; ...at which point, I'll install an older, unsupported set of drivers?&nbsp; No no no...

Issue #3:&nbsp; In reading the forums, JEOS was designed for the Home edition of VMware.&nbsp; Funny, you would think Canonical, who largely wrote and makes its money from selling enterprise versions of Ubuntu, would want corporate users like me to use the product.&nbsp; Why on earth would it not be designed for VMWare Workstation, which their target would be using?&nbsp; If I'm happy with the product, I, as PM, will recommend JEOS+VMWare.&nbsp; 

So (sigh) I guess either Ubuntu JEOS or VMWare will just have to miss out.&nbsp; Can't evaluate it, won't use it."

"event","In a way, I feel sorry for the presidential candidates this year.&nbsp; 

The USA is headed for a recession and the Bush Administration knows it.&nbsp; That's why GWB is pushing on the Economic Stimulus Package (ESP) so hard.&nbsp; Turning the economy around is a slow process.&nbsp; It's like a big ship, being pushed through the water by one man.&nbsp; If that man is strong enough they can eventually stop the ship and change its course, but it takes time to change the direction of momentum.&nbsp; 

We're in for some rough years ahead, and I have no faith that the ESP is going to make any noticeable change in the short term.&nbsp; It may, however, delay the declaration that the Bush Administration's actions have plunged us into recession.

What's the connection?&nbsp; Well, the next U.S. president will have to deal with a recession, and turning the economy around will be a slow process that might take more than 4 years.&nbsp; Something George Bush Sr. didn't have to deal with was a record drop in confidence in the American dollar by foreign investors.&nbsp; 

Though it is my hope that one of the Democrat candidates is GWB's successor (both address important issues and can heal this country's injuries from the war in Iraq through their vision alone), it is concerning that so many foreign nations still view women and black people as weak.&nbsp; It remains to be seen how this will affect international relations; either equality across the human race will begin to spread to other nations or the bias will be so strong that a ""weak"" leader will further diminish the value of the dollar, raising the US dollar cost of offshore labor, adding to the cost of consumer products and dramatically increasing inflation.

War seems to be the only international metric of a leader's strength.&nbsp; Though I'm anti-war, perhaps war-time actions are the only way Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton can be viewed as a strong leader of the United States."

"event","About how many web sites do you have a username and password for?  100?  1,000?  10,000?  ...and how many passwords do you use across those web sites?  Most people (including me) will answer, ""one or two.""&nbsp;  Who can possibly remember all of these passwords?&nbsp;  As I do more and more of my banking online and rely on computers for more and more aspects of my life and document my reputation electronically using services like Naymz, I grow more and more uncomfortable with this.&nbsp; So I decided to do a bit of research about this, and to pass along my findings.<br /><br /><font size=""5"">Bad solutions:</font><br /><br /><font size=""4"">No one will ever guess it</font><br /><br />No matter how complicated your password might be, someone *will* learn it if they really want to.  You might be thinking ""I have nothing I want to protect!"" or ""I have no enemies.""  Well, identity thieves don't care who you are, and they need surprisingly little information to get your password.  Some web sites give your ""forgotten"" password if you answer enough security questions.  You might be surprised how easy it is to get that information -- some web sites ask nothing more than a birthday and your mother's maiden name.  For the determined identity thief, your mother's maiden name can be determined from something you've blogged about your a grandparent, using genealogy research methods, or even through phishing (getting you to reveal that information to them without your realizing you're giving the information to a crook).  Remember, if you're using the same password on multiple sites, it only takes one cracked site to gain access to everything -- bank accounts, credit cards, etc.&nbsp; Your birthdate can be found anywhere.&nbsp; A stolen, handwritten medical record might be the thief's starting point.<br /><br /><font size=""4"">ID Vault (and similar devices)</font><br /><br />I just heard about the ID Vault on the radio.&nbsp; This is a combination of security software and a secure encrypted storage device that remembers all of your passwords and credit cards for you.&nbsp; This is a great step in the right direction, but gives the user a false sense of security.  There are some problems with it:<br /><ul><li>though your passwords remain protected from anyone who might find the device, a PIN is all that's required to unlock the device.  You have to make sure your PIN is not something anyone could discover.</li></ul><ul><li>until the ID Vault and your PDA or smartphone support secure Bluetooth technology, if you access the Internet using your phone, you'll still have to remember the password for any site you would access with your phone.&nbsp; That makes your passwords no more secure than they were before.</li><li>The device does nothing to secure your password once it's on the network.&nbsp; If you aren't using SSL to logon to your IMAP or POP server, your password is visible to any device or software between your computer and the destination.&nbsp; The packets are surprisingly easy to read and assemble.&nbsp; Check out WireShark for how you can do this yourself (you can learn in under an hour).</li></ul><font size=""4"">Biometrics</font><br /><br />Most personal information that is stolen is not accessed because they guessed your password.&nbsp; Someone gains access by going around the password.&nbsp; So passwords are really almost a moot point.&nbsp; ...but at least if someone discovers your password, you can change it.&nbsp; Now, try changing your fingerprints, or your retina.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Why can't you?&nbsp; Not only is laser surgery expensive, painful, and potentially harmful, most accomplished plastic and eye surgeons would consider that type of surgery to be unethical and refuse to perform it.<br /><br /><font size=""4"">Change your password regularly</font><br /><br />The chance that your password will be guessed today is the same that it was yesterday and the day before, regardless of how often you change it.&nbsp; By putting special characters like control characters (represented by hearts, happy-faces, and other symbols), or symbols like $%][@`&gt;&lt; in the password you can make it much harder for a malicious program to store, but if you have a fairly secure password, changing it regularly only wards off one thing:&nbsp; the password that is successfully collected and then not used until after you've made a change.&nbsp; Chances are if your personal information is collected and used to steal your identity, the crook didn't obtain your password to do it, so password changes only help so much, but then again, it's just as unwise to leave your front door unlocked at night (especially in a city that is as crowded as the Internet).<br /><br /><font size=""5"">Better solutions (but still not perfect)</font><br /><br /><font size=""4"">Random password generator programs</font><br /> <br /> This is a near-perfect solution.&nbsp; The string of random letters, numbers, and symbols is often misinterpreted as plain old data when seen by a packet sniffer, and since it wasn't generated from the outside, only you and your computer know what it is.&nbsp; There's still the remote chance that your equipment's near-random number generator's pattern is guessed by someone with similar equipment, but you have a better chance of lightning hitting your house.&nbsp; <br /><br /><font size=""4"">Random password generators -- web sites</font><br /><br />Due to certain corporate policies at AMD, I used to change my passwords every 90 days or so.&nbsp; I used a random password generator to create something sufficiently difficult for a script to capture or for a person to remember.&nbsp; Even if it's viewable over the wire, most crooks would think the password was encrypted and move on to another target.&nbsp; ...but this too is not perfect.&nbsp; The right Trojan in the password generator's system can capture your (static, if it's a PC at work) IP address and the passwords generated, then target your machine to collect more data.&nbsp; <br /><br /><font size=""4"">Personal SSL Certificate</font><br /><br />Personal certificates are near-perfect.&nbsp; You can buy one from Verisign, or you can obtain free certificates for personal use from Thawte or CAcert.&nbsp; They're transmitted over a secure link, half of the certificate is generated by your computer (which remains private and will never be transmitted over the network) and half by the certificate authority (CA).&nbsp; You can then download the CA's portion and your computer will merge the two, creating a certificate that the CA can affirm matches your identity but that is incomplete without the portion only your computer knows.&nbsp; The finished certificate can then be uploaded to a mobile device like a Blackberry or a Windows Mobile smartphone so that you can gain access to web sites and prove your identity.&nbsp; The whole process is incredibly secure.&nbsp; You don't need to remember a password because when you visit a secure site, your browser says ""I am John Smith, here's the proof"" and the site lets you in on an encrypted connection.&nbsp; <br /><br />...but since both Thawte and CAcert certificates can be hard to obtain (you need to meet up with Thawte and CAcert notaries with your photo ID and have them sign off that you are who you say you are), most people don't bother, and most web sites don't support them.&nbsp; I believe in the technologies enough that I'm well into the process of generating the proper certificates and even applied to be a CAcert notary, but they won't do me much good today.<br /><br /><font size=""4"">Single Sign-on</font><br /><br />The benefits of single sign-on are mostly convenience.&nbsp; Sign on once, never worry about signing on again.&nbsp; ...but there are security benefits too.&nbsp; One password authority means one server to secure, reducing the points of failure.&nbsp; If implemented properly, the token that gives the user access privileges is not easy to spoof, and works similar to the personal certificate model discussed above.<br /><br />Microsoft ActiveDirectory attempts to do this, though sometimes the web browser doesn't realize that a password entered for one web site might also be applicable to other servers and prompts for the password several times.&nbsp; That's the case even with Internet Explorer, which does a better job than Firefox does at recognizing single signon ActiveDirectory events, but may still prompt the user many times within one Microsoft SharePoint session.&nbsp; That would seem to undermine the convenience factor, and requires the password to be transmitted several times.&nbsp; Each time over the wire is an opportunity to crack the code!<br /><br /><font size=""4"">Keep the passwords different, using your head</font><br /><br />This article <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/software/passwords/geek-to-live--choose-and-remember-great-passwords-184773.php"">http://lifehacker.com/software/passwords/geek-to-live--choose-and-remember-great-passwords-184773.php</a> describes ways you can generate unique but easy-to-remember passwords for every site.&nbsp; This is probably the best practical way of doing it.&nbsp; Combine this with special characters and it becomes exceedingly unlikely that someone who learns your password at one site will gain access to all of your web sites."

"event","When I was in college (1996-2001) I thought the only places where I could sell my unneeded books at the end of the quarter or semester was through the university bookstore or through Off Campus Books (located across the street from the bookstore which often had better prices).  Sure there were online services that would do the same thing, but usually they paid even less than the beforementioned alternatives for books, and by the time you pay for packaging and shipping, what's the point?  ...and maybe at the time, that's really all there was!

Now that I'm back in college again (MBA), I've discovered a much better way of doing things.  A division of eBay called half.com allows you to post your books, music, or video games for a set price.  The description of the item is usually prepopulated, and the buyer needs only to decide which copy they want to buy, and what quality they're after (new, like new, very good, etc.).  

Though the buyers pay for the shipping costs, the seller has to pay for the book (or whatever) to be packaged & padded.  :(  ...but since the cost of listing the item is minimal, even after packing up the item, the seller gets to keep most of the proceeds!  

Why is it called ""half""?  *shrug*  I dunno'.  Cost of the textbooks isn't 50% off, but maybe they're referring to the seller fees, which are actually *less than* half of what it costs elsewhere.

As you can tell, I'm a big fan of this site.  I'm both buying and selling almost all of my books on half.com now.  

Besides packaging, a drawback to half.com is that textbook, music, or video game might be on your shelf for a while.  There's no guarantee that anyone will buy it.  Ever.  You can adjust the price to make it competitive, but it's not like eBay where the highest bidder gets the item.  It's more like something between a library and a bazaar.  You the buyer have several copies to choose from, and all of the items might have been on the shelf for months."

"event","When I was in college I decided to invest in an electronic organizer.  Why?  Well, I could only set one or two alarms with a watch, and they would only be good for a day.  I needed something I could write everything down in to plan out homework, etc.  I had a choice -- Windows CE or Palm.  Well Palm had all the software and I was already a bit anti-Windows at that point, so I chose Palm.

I continued using Palm-powered devices after that, and my latest device, a Treo 600, I got through work in December of 2004.  Recently the company has tried to switch as many people over to Blackberries as possible, but they're continuing to at least maintain the phone plans of people with Treo 600's, even if they couldn't provide support for the device any longer.  

There's a rule that the top 20% of your customers are going to provide 80% of your revenue because those are the customers that are loyal to the brand.  They're repeat customers, buying additional services, accessories, etc.  I guess I would qualify as a top 20% customer.  Since I can't get AMD to pay for a newer Treo, I've been holding on tight to my Treo 600 even through some rather odd behaviors as it gets older (like turning itself off when I snap down the magnetic clip on my cell phone holder).  I buy Palm accessories for it to keep up with the current trends as much as I can while still using the same phone/PDA (""Smartphone"").

After Linux World Expo was shut down for the day and after a fairly ""meh"" dinner at one of the restaurants in San Francisco I decided to browse the mall and came across a Palm store.  I figured maybe I could get a new AC car adapter for my Treo 600 (loose connection in the old one so I threw it away a month or two ago), a screen protector, or some other gadget.  So as I'm looking at the accessories wall the saleswoman asked me if there was something she could help me find.  I asked, ""what do you have for the Treo 600.""  ""Nothing.""  Oh.  ooookay......  ""...but you can try pdaparts.com; they may have some used accessories or old inventory...""

So much for being loyal to the Palm brand.  I still prefer Palm devices because that's what I'm most familiar with but I would have been happy to spend some money there if they still had support for my device.

I can still get some more use out of my Treo 600 so I'll use it as long as I can."

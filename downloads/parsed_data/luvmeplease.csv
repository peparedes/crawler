i knew the day would come cause nothing can last forever, but i didnt
want it to be now, but it did and it will happen again so the best
thing i can do is keep expecting it. all there is to say is last night
was not a good night-my dream was not a good one-this morning was not a
good morning and gym was fun cause jenna mark n leeeengunie and me all
played bound ball! wahoo...but other than that&nbsp; its not working

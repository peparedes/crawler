<font size=""1"">Yup  everyone  I  have  gone  friends  only.  For  you  this  means  one  of  three  things:

  1.  Friends: You  need  to  do  nothing  except  perhaps  possibly  login  to  read.

  2.  Non-friend  LJ  users:  Comment  to  be  added.  I  will  probablly  do  it  no  problem.  Odds  are,  if  you  think  (or  know)  I  don't  like  you  and  you  comment  to  be  added  anyway,  I  will  admire  the  balls  you  have  to  step-up  like  that  and  add  you,  droping  all  problems  I  had  with  you  before.  (This  is  NOT  a  guarentee.)

  3.  Non-LJ  users:  If  you  really  want  to  read,  GET  A  DAMN  LJ!!!  It  isn't  hard,  it's  free,  you  don't  HAVE  to  post  in  it  at  all,  and  odds  are  you  will  end  up  liking  it.

Sorry  for  everyone  who  I  have  put  out  by  this.  It  is  just  that  some  people  read  my  journal  who  I  DO  NOT  want  them  to  and  this  will  eliminate  that  problem.

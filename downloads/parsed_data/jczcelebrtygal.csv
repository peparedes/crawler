"event","Well, I got back from the movies about 20 minutes ago....

I went with sofie and we met up with some guys she met a few weeks back. Some cute Russian boys.

I know. random

anyways, I immediately got annoyed because they smoked about 20 cigs in 20 minutes. It was crazy. so we go to watch ""my boss's daughter"" and it gets kind of annoying so we leave to go watch ""cabin fever"" or whatever. Well, Ivan suggests we go there. DO NOT WATCH THAT MOVIE. 

it was not a thriller.
it was not scary.
it was just plain nasty and stupid. 

so im sitting there, freaking annoyed at these stupid russian seniors and I feel like a damn 3rd wheel. i sit next to sofie and Ivan sits next to her. His stupid friends sit on the row behind us. While they're cuddling and him trying to feel her up. ahem. <b>attempting</b> I sat there, wincing at the stupid movie. 

We finally get out at 9:30 and my mom doesn't come pick us up because she's watching her show. So i'm stuck there for like 45 minutes with some random group of russian boys, jabbering away in russian with some random ""yah"" and ""dah's"" and then these two black ghetto guys come over and check sofie and I out with some russian boys. I was so annoyed. I just wanted to leave. 

They ended up staying there with us until my mom came. I felt kind of bad, being such a bad sport, leaving when they got close. (well, their smoke was so unbelievably thick) and avoiding them when they tried to talk to me. 
they were so sad...Ivan trying to get it with sofie, apparently running his hands up her thighs and complaining when she moved it. He says ""back home in russia, hand holding and touching is nothing. Zis is just friendship."" sofie-""well, im sorry but im freaking 14 and this is America.""




I'll just hang out with sofie another time minus russian smokers. 



*hyperventalates* (sp?)
I. have. to. perform. tomorrow. 

well, if I get through practice all day tomorrow first. then I will die. Wish me luck guys."

"event","Hey muslams.

I am just at work.  It turns out that I have not posted here in over 2 weeks.

Bad LJ'er, bad.

I went to the ol ""BIG K"" last night.   Did a quiz night.  I think we did well.  Maybe its because I had a beer a round.  Did you know...

Then we headed to ""Club K""  whop whop (NOT WHOOP!).  We sung our asses off and met heaps of randoms - very cheap night, probably because of my amazing voice.  People love you = they buy you drinks.  I was the man.

ANy way, all is well at Muzz mountin.  I think that I am on the road to a million dollars.

Bye Muslams"

"event","Becky and I just had this massive fight and I think that we are over...

Im sad.  Someone comfort me.

She called me a whore and I said some not so nice things back.  But definately not as bad as whore.

Then she ate my chips and I pulled her hair,  I pretty much feel like crying now.

I really want to be friends with her again..."

"event","ITS COLD!  Oh so cold.

It would be nice to say that I have a house that is warm.  A house with a roaring fire and no mold.

I dont.

As I breath in out, fog is coming out of my mouth.  Big thick clouds to, not those little wussy ones.  Im not a wuss.

I slept last night in thermals, jammies, thigh high socks, slippers, a beanie, a jacket, my duvet, my wollen blanket on top of that, my big big jacket on top of that and my spare pillows blocking the mini holes.  Gosh.

Im grumpy, but surprisingly happy at the same time.  Probably because my flat mates did something dumb, and something cool.

I bet that you are confused, I am.

Bye fans.

---------

Summit logo appears with simple piano keys and light strings in the background music.

A scene fades in, deep in the forest. Bella's standing with her back to Edward, with Edward a few feet behind her.

Bella : How old are you?
Edward (voice almost a whisper): 17

The camera pans around and focuses in on her face, which is full of shock and a bit of fear, her eyes cut to him as if she wants to turn and face him but doesn't quite have the courage.



Bella: How long have you been 17?

Cuts to a clip of Edward crouched, as if hunting. A quick sequence of a deer running, trees and leaves flying past follows and ends as a figure rushes from the left and pounces the deer. Cut back to Edward, still behind Bella but a little closer than before.

Edward: Awhile.

The words ""When you can live forever"" come onto the screen.

A figure seems to fly through the air among the tree tops before the scene cuts to Jasper, talking to Edward over the hood of a car.

Jasper: This is wrong, Edward. She's not one of us.

Cut to Edward, looking intense as his fingers grip the car top. Then a brief scene comes up, firelight-type glow with Edward leaning in towards Bella, her mouth slightly opened. Fade back to black. (I'd put in the screencap for this, but it really isn't good enough quality to see what's going on...)

The words ""what do you live for"" come onto the screen.

Bella's putting something in her backpack, which is laid on the hood of her truck. She glances over, and we see Edward watching her from across the parking lot, next to his Volvo.



Horns honk, and the van races in out of control. We hear screeching brakes and the camera cuts to Bella in time for us to see Edward swoop in and pull her down to the ground. The van slams towards them, and Edward's hand leaves a huge impression in the metal where he stops it. Bella looks up at him confused and shocked, and a look of sheer panic floods over Edward's face.

The words ""From the world wide bestsellers"" come onto the screen.

Cut to a scene in (I'm assuming) Bella's room. Bella faces Edward, her back to the windows overlooking a forest.

Bella: I'm not scared of you.

Edward leans in a tiny bit closer.

Edward: You really shouldn't have said that.

They stare at one another for a moment, and the corners of Edward's lips quirk up in a mischievous and sly smile that's almost a smirk before he tosses her arms over his shoulders, swings her onto his back and leaps out of the window."

"event","Raven here, Griffin told me to write so I thought I would tell you about my bus ride home. Okay...It starts with me and Griffin waiting for the bus. I go and Glomb Shadow after I slip a writing piece I did during afterschool into Griffin's purse. ANYWAYS I just so happen to sit next to shadow on the bus 'cause one, I WANT to sit next to him and be near him as much as posible and two, Griffin and Shim were sitting behind him. So it was okay at first. I think that was because I was distracted by talking to him about calloge and stuff, but then we got silent and the images came. I told Griffin about it and she said that she was having the same problem...but the difference between her problem and mine is that SHE GETS TO AT LEAST KISS SHIM!!!!!! I was stuck trying not to blush and glancing at him every FIVE SECONDS.

Yes, my nickname my family has been calling me for 3 years now is drama queen because I make a big deal out of little things, but the big things that happen I say, ""F it and move on."" 

Kinda like this morning. I apolgize to all my friends that had to deal with my depression and pissy state these past four days. 
Sorry to Synook, Rave, Bronte, and Scott because they got the worst of it. 

And sorry to Joel for getting the worst of the worst of my anger and fighting me for two days. 

And I'm sorry about my bitchy-ness about Shim not being at school and my worry-ness and such. I can't beleive I went pysco like that. 
But when I got home and 'played' outside (danced to breaking benjamin actully) I got some fresh air and all teh negative energy left me. 

And will prob return if Shim doesn't go to school tomorrow. Ha!"

Oh, to add to my anger, I hurt one of my closeest friends last night. 

Joel(use his character name for Silent Howl) is in love with this girl, Blasia (her Silent Howl name) but she flurts with two other guys also. She flurts with alot of people, but she tells Joel that it's different with him. 
She told me that she didn't want to ruin her relationship-friendship with Joel, then told Joel that flurting was 'just the way she was.'

I'm so fucking pissed that everytime she flurts with him, he's so happy! Then when I see her flurting and giggling anf touching the other two guys, I get so pissed and want to scream whore or slut to her because 'that's the way she is.' 

One time Joel found out of her 'flurtyness' and he shook in class from so much stress, I tried to hold him down to stop, he was abut to break and cry I know it. 
What does he do? Run back to her!!

This has been going on since the begining of the year now. Last night he told me he had 'better chances' because he can drive her around when no one else can cause her parents said so. (nice way to use your friends)
Then the fact that 'she cares differently about him' and I'm to pissed off to remember the third. 

So last nigth I snapped and said he was only hurting himself, and he said he didn't care. So I told him when/if they start dating, the first thing she's gunna do is cheat and he said he was done talking to me and goodnight. I told him Cya and went to bed pissed off. 

Now I feel like crying, or breaking Blasia's face. Eithor or, Joel won't talk to me for a while.

He told me to drop it when I talked to him last, and to never talk about her again. I know he's still mad."

I'm so pissed off at myself! 

One of the top things I'm mad at myself for, is the fact that I'm a worthless peice of shit that doesn't do anything. I need to get a job, get my license, start working on my grades. 
I'm just so fustrated because I'm going to france next summer and I was using it as my goal to get a job and pay for the 2,200-3,300 price range that will double if my mom goes and when she found out, she said she was going to pay for everything. Then I overhear that she and my step dad are getting me a car, even though I have my beat-up old blazer that I like. They are wasteing their money on me when they have enough debt as it is!
I also keep promising people that I'll get more of my SilentHowl Novel done, but everytime I sit down to do it, I keep putting it off and find things to distract me...

Shim was joking around and said I'd never get stuff finished and I only do it half-way before I drop it or lose intrest in it. And it's true and I feel so pathetic about it..and I really truely want to get Silent Howl published, but I KNOW when I try, that they will say it's a copy of Twilight or spin off and then I'm fucked. Even though it's not at all!!I can't beat Steph Meyer!

Then when I'm on one of my Rp'ing sites, I just get so ticked after awhile because it's like a stupid addiction to a fantasy life, and Snyook was complaing he had no friends and no one Roleplays with him when he's usually not online when he's playing his 360 or other games, bowling, or at work.
He has a life, yet he complains that no one rp's with him. He's lucky, I have NO LIFE, sit home and do nothing but sit on these little fantasy rp websites and he's upset that I rp so much more than him?!
Then when I DON'T get online because I'm out with Shim, they get mad at me! WTF?!
I also get pissed of when people don't keep their characters the way they are or can't decid, and I'm not complain or trying to get mad, but it's been ticking me off lately. The characters arn't real, just pick them to be some way and keep them like that!
If you want them to change, don't let it be in one or two posts, try and make it over time! If we are going to be obsessive and live in a fantasy world, minds well try and make it seem somewhat realistc.

I miss hanging out with my raven....*tears up*

You know the last time I was truly happy? Besides when I'm with Shim or Rave, Yesterday I laid in the warm sun with an awesome breeze for 3 hours just because. 
Then this morning I blasted, ""Hero Heroine."" by boys like girls or whatever and actully washed my kitchen tile floor and danced on the slippery surface. 
I'm about to do it again to finish the other half of the kitchen, like I said, half done only, but it wasn't my fault! My mom yelled at me for starting it so early...

I guess I'm also having withdrawl from Shim. I haven't talked or seen him since school on frieday and I guess I just miss him. Weekends are hard when he can't be be near or talk to me. 

Theres more personal matters also, but I truly don't care to write them down."

Ok, ok, ok, I haven't written about Shim at all on Lj for a reason. He's mine, I'm selfish and you don't need to know about 'US'. 

But you can tonight ^_^ 

I'm EXTREMELY Giddy right now. I just got home (10:32pm) from the movies with him, but let's not jump the gun here. 

He came over the same time he usually does (4:15-ish-ness) and had dinner. The usual was in order, randomly showing each other stuff online. 'Arguing' about how to spell 'NOM' not Nam. Talk about future plans and debating on them, and of'course I did my chorses, which he stayed at my side faithfully. Well, not beside, more like behind. ^_^

Anyway, we never really go out on dates, besides the whole going out to eat with the family kinda stuff, and going bowling with each others family. 
Well, we decided (he actully lol) to go to the movies and see, ""Run fat boy run!"" Which was an amazing movie by the way! I rate it a 9/10 only because it did have some heart-wrenching scenes that hit home a bit. 

Anyway, when we got to the theater my step dad brought us and then let us go in alone. Thanks to Shim for paying for me aswell. ^_^
I was actully glad that I had Shim to myself for the movie, and we came a whole half 'n hour early to chat without bothering anybody. 

And to save time and effort because I'm dead tired and still need to take a shower, I'll script the night in some parts. ^_^

*We walk into the room as previews have yet to begin*
Shim: Uh, Yes! *bolts up the steps*
Me: We're sitting at the top? *all smiles*
Shim: Yeah! You're heads even with the screen and nobody can kick you. 

He also mentoned kicking people during scary movies and we laughed about Dane cooks acts about the theater, requoting most of them and playing with the drink cup holder. 
All in all, no one came and we had the whole scene to ourselves. 
He cracked jokes that he bought all the seats. ^_^

One of the previews was some kinda axe comercial and we were watching it and it had a girl and a guy in a bed room and they are onyl wearing their underwear and they jump (roughly) off the bed and onto the floor where there is a white outline square.
Anyway, they start wrestling and throwing each other around. 
Suddenly, Shim turns around and goes, ""That's gunna be us isn't it?"" I laughed and he was like, ""Can we do that?!"" He looked like a kid finding out he was going to Disney world ahahahah!


During about three or four scenes when nothing was shown or the screen went black, yes, we did kiss. Hey, we wern't hurtn anybody, fair game ^_^ Then the occasional sneaky kiss he darted in. ^_^

Oh and these----> ^_^ They are my actions an signature smilies. If you don't see alot of them, it means I'm not really happy and I'm acting, but seriously, my face hurts so much from smiling. So this ^_^ Will do. Yes it will. 

I did kick the popcorn and made a mess though in the begining of the movie. I knew I'd do comething clumbsy at some point in time. He saved it though and not much went to waste, before he ever so slyly brushed it under the seats and to the back wall. Hahaha!

The ride home was the best. I think we are at our most romantic in cars...I have NO idea why...I'll think about it tonight though ^_^ 
The ride home in itself was wonderful, like an entirely different night. Oh! And let me just say this, the night sky tonight? AMAZING! Not a full moon, (one night off), but dear lord how clear the night air was, seeing the stars and the not black but navy blue ocean like sky tonight just took my breath away. 
And that wasn't the only thing that took my breath away. I do have a bit of a stuffy nose, but not runny, so it's all good, but when I kissed him on the ride home, 
(Or should I say the numerous times Haha!)
I actully lost my breath and ending up panting! I never thought I'd do that. 

His smile tonight was so breath taking as well. He look so happy, proud and content, like it was the most wonderful time he had in a long time. The smile was different than all the other ones I've seen, and it couldn't quite leave his face eithor. When we drove home on  the highway, it was on his face permanently! 
Let's see if I can discribe the smile...hmmm...
It was soft, not much muscle being used except when I kised his nose and his face brightened up for a while. Then it'd tone back down to its normal state. He face was so peaceful, like he found something he was searching for. 
He told me on the ride home that this was his favorite night out of all our nights. I was extremely pleased, because really all we did was be ourselves and laugh to a movie and cuddle in the car on the ride home.  
It hit second on my list of tops nights though, I have two nights tieing for first, but that's another story, Haha!
I'm really happy though, that I can make him so light and carefree and content, just by being beside him. I'm not good at anything really, and he's amazing at almost everything he tries! I'm perfectly fine with the idea that my only talent, my only purpose in life is to make him have that soft carefree smile. It's been (and always will be) my goal in life. 

And the face that he has when I finish kissing him, the one with the eyes closed, lost breath, and still open mouth when the green eyes slowley open to shift ever so slightly to my own. 

Oh HELLS TO THE YEAH! That's MY smile. ^_^

The last thing we did for the night was check on Walleye. Every night my step dad and I go to a river around 9:00 at night to see these fish that have glowing gold eyes when the spotlight hits them. Well they have been spawning since Easter and theres about a hundred every so often that fill the river, and it's amazing to see. 
The night only made the river and sky so much more beautiful than it has ever been to me really.
Oh, scratch that. When I went out on the snow mobile with Shim, I think that was the most beautiful night. 
It's was the christmas lights and the snow though, so thats cheat'n ahaha!

When we dropped him off he was clearly happy and content with his night. Earlyer in the afternoon I bought him chocolate covered pretzels, which he left in the back of the explorer. There were only a few left, so I opened the rest and popped a few in my mouth, and outta no where my step dad purks up and yells, ""I smell chocolate!!"" And I burst out laughing, nearly coughing on the food. 

SDAD: Betch, you said you had nothing left! Hand 'em over!
Me: -laughing and handing him the remaining three-
SDAD: You Owe me big tonight. 

Indeed I do, indeed I do. ^_^

When I got home, of'course I rushed to type this all up here on LJ, but suddenly my cells rings. It's Shim, and he's comming back over tomorrow night. ^_^

Total ^_^: 13 

I'll be sure to update later on events such as Silent Howl and Court. But for tonight, I'm on cloud Nine."

Besides if you want to believe that I am ALWAYS eccentric them heres a classic scientific quote ""OPPOSITES ATTRACT!!!!"" so there.<br /></div><br /><br />Huggles&nbsp;<br />Raven&nbsp;"

The most updated and largest fan club site: http://www.twilightvinculum.com/

Finally! Th offical movie website is out!
 http://thetwilightmovie.com/

------------------------------------------
Update on senior project:
I started ch2 (yeah!) but it deleted the 3 pages I had (no!!!) so I have to start over again..

I have 18 total pictures of my characters that I have to finish outlining and color, here's the problem though, It's more like I have to do it and it's a job, and now I'm putting it off...
But that's ok and good news because I really need to worry on the book itself rather than the pictures which I only use in like youtube video's a a way to beat my fans away with a stick lol. 

The Senior Project:

I was inspired by the president of my literary Magazine school-group to do my senior project on the process of getting a book/novel published. 

I know that I can't put anything up on here about it except the characters and fan art of them, because people are picky little crackers and complain eithor about my rough draft spelling mistacks or they completely and utterly take the damn thing. 

Hear that art theives? YOUR NOT WELCOMED!!

So anyway, Silent Howl is a book about me and my friends living in our small town and living everyday life to the fullest by breaking rules and habits. Oh, and some of us our vamps and werewolves. =) 

Half my friends and teachers have read the prologue and the first chapter. Only my closest friends have read the entire outline and little bits that I have done with the whole 20 chapters. 
I'm already starting book two ha!

Anyway, music video's of my friends and scenes from the book of our favorite parts will be aired (wow...weird typing that...) on my youtube sooner than later. 

I hope to get this published so bad ^_^

Omg!! I'm so HYPER and EXCITED!! And, I will tell you why in a moment, first lets run threw the weird and funny events of today. ^_^

I woke up an hour earlyer than usual, 5:00am instead of 6:00am. I didn't finish some dishes so my step dad made me get up and clean the whole kitchen but the floor which saved for when I came home. 
I was to tired to fight back and did it with a yawn. 

Because Gamer was suspened off the bus, mom drives us to school, and I like it better. My bus driver is always making us late and even my teachers don't believe us when we say the bus was late. 
On the way to schol we saw 5 cop cars pulling over an old man (had to be like 70) and getting rough with him!

Going to third block was funny today, because like every other day the hallways were packed! And everyone shoves and pushes and gets hurt in the math hallway because it's the smallest hallway filled with big seniors and juniors. 
It was hilarious though because I was walking with Shim and we couldn't get across and he suddenly walked infront of his kid, poked his stomach and went, ""PAUSE!"" Before grabbing me and pulling me threw. 

Third block was so confusing and exciting too! We had a firedrill, but none of the alarms went off downstairs or in the science hallway, and teachers were yelling at students to turn their cell phones off thinking they were ring tones!!
It was also during a lunch and kids didn't want to leave their treys of food. 
This also wasn't a drill, seems the alarms were set off from dust or something in the music room, and the teachers sent us back into the school when they still didn't know what was wrong in the school!! Talk about stupid!!

Ok, but back to the amazing news!!
When I was younger, I LOVED Ocarina of time from Zelda. I always wanted to learn to play, but when I askd my dad if I could learn and buy one, he said they were simply toys and the music was made by a computer and machine from the company. 
But after seeing some youtube videos, I was amazed!
There was a whole group of ocarina players! A club, and ocarinas arn't expensive at all!  
Check this out!!
https://songbirdocarina.com/

It's so in my grasp! But when I asked, my mom didn't mind, and said to ask My step dad. 
Of'course though...he said no. 
So my hyper and excited attitude shattered and I feel like I've been for the last few days. Sad and not modivated to do anything anymore."

It! was sent by a medical doctor - Make sure to read what is in the closing statement AFTER THE POEM. 


SLOW DANCE 


Have you ever watched kids 

On a merry-go-round? 

Or listened to the rain 

Slapping on the ground? 

Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight? 
Or gazed at the sun into the fading night? 

You better slow down. 

Don't dance so fast. 

Time is short. 

The music won't last. 


Do you run through each day 

On the fly? 

When you ask How are you? 

Do you hear the reply? 

When the day is done 
! 

Do you lie in your bed 

With the next hundred chores 

Running through your head? 

You'd better slow down 

Don't dance so fast. 

Time is short. 

The music won't last. 


Ever told your child, 

We'll do it tomorrow? 

And in your haste, 

Not see his sorrow? 

Ever lost touch, 

Let a good friendship die 

Cause you never had time 

To call and say,'Hi' 

You'd better slow down. 

Don't dance so fast. 

Time is short. 

The music won't last. 

When you run so fast to get somewhere 

You miss half the fun of getting there. 

When you worry and hurry through your day, 

It is like an unopened gift.. 

Thrown away. 

Life is not a race. 

Do take it slower 

Hear the music 

Before the song is over."

Sharing

    Sharing is a concept that has been inadvertently
crammed down our throats since infancy. Unfortunately,
sharing is becoming a mythical term. I am sad to say
that I do not have many sharing experiences do to the
latest 'mine' trend the world is currently going
through. However, I do have ONE sharing experience
that changed my life for the better. It was not a 'I
gave food to the hungry and I felt so good it changed
my life' sort of experiance.
    A year ago I finally had a class with my, now,
best froend. I wll call her by her nickname, Griffin,
to respect her privacy. It started out with Griffin
helping me with my, almost nonexistent, drawing skills
and talking about light things like drawing, books,
and boys. As time passed, we began to become closer
and stated sharing more personal things about
ourselves like, past experiences no one else knows
about, family issues and uncertain feelings.
    This may seem insignifigent to some people,
however, to me, sharing my feelings and painful
experiences with Griffin kept me grounded. Griffin is
the only reason I am no longer violent. If I had not
shared my feelings with Griffin and she, in turn, had
not shared her wisdom I would have given into my
depression.
     Thanks to Griffin's help I became more open. I
started volunteering as much as I could. First, I
started by helping out with the local girlscouts.
Then, I put as much hours into the library as I could.
Now I plan to valenteer at the animal shelter. With my
valenteer work I like to think that sharing my time
will help people. Even if it is one person at a time."

"event","Griffin speaking:

As most of you know or have figure out, I love anime. Not too long ago, any good title that came out in Japan would be licensed here. However, that's died down quite a bit. Anyways, I read this and think anyone who loves anime and wants to see more should read it:

---------------------------------------------

An Important message from Chris Ayers.

""As I said I've got an important message for everyone. I don't know if you're all aware of the state of the industry, but right now the anime industry is in big trouble. We've already seen the collapse of one distribution company (Geneon) and there are likely to be more in the near future. Here's the thing, Illegal bit torrenting, downloading and P2P file sharing are destroying the industry.

Here's the cold hard facts, If the American companies fold it will be lights out for the anime industry in Japan, and then there will be no more anime. It's that simple. Right now the reason a majority of the shows in Japan are being able to be finished is because of the American companies picking up the Licenses, if they fold, then shows will not only stop in midstream, but will go away all together.

This is a crusade my brother has been on for 3 years now and has been met with anger, hatred and vitriol, but he keeps going because he doesn't want to see the industry vanish, and that's exactly what will happen.

Think about it, a few years ago when the parent company for Suncoast Video went bankrupt it was not long before several major anime studio's in Japan had to close. Could it be that the decrease in American Sales meant that the companies couldn't license shows, and as a result the studio's had to close? Just makes sense my friends.

Anyway it's becoming a hot topic in the anime community. I personally think that fans helped create the anime industry and it will have to be fans that save it from themselves. If you want to know what you can do...
1. Stop downloading and bit torrenting if you are.
2. Let your friends who do this know how they're going to end up losing something they love, because of greed or whatever reason they have for doing it.
3. Let your local conventions know that you don't want fansubs shown at the convention as it's hurting the industry, and will eventually cause it's collapse.

Other than that, We'll have to see if fans end up doing the right thing. Oh and for your friends who think the Japanese don't care about all of this. Take a look at the video of Nabashin on Greg's Bootlegging and Fansubbing panel from Onicon 07. It will help open your eyes. 

Hope everyone is well and I'm glad to be back.

Love and Laughter Always
-Chris-""

Please copy/Paste this and spread the word far and wide. It was our
demand that made anime as big as it is today, and it'll be our greed
that will kill both the industry and fandom if we don't act now.


-------------------------------------

I hope that fans will start realizing that it's hurting our chances to see more anime and start acting right. I know though that some (many in fact) feel it's their right to download it if they can. It's sad, really. If they even considered how much people in Japan are paying for what they think they have the right to get for free. I understand that in some cases, fansubs can be useful. But really, you have to admit that the majority of people who download fansubs do NOT buy the series when it comes available on DVD and there are several who do not buy anime at all. They download even series that have been out for years. And youtube, well youtube has just made the matter worse.
So I hope some people wise up... or we may see a decline in anime even worse than what has already happened."

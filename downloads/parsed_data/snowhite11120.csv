I'm ending with ""My White Knight"" from ""The Music Man"" (for all those North High folks, you know why I'm doing that) and then my last song will be...
""Think of Me"" from ""The Phantom of the Opera.""

And while some people will refer to it as Single Awareness Day or whatever other clever name they can come up with for an alternative holiday not revolving around romance, I think there is one important thing to remember: 
Whether or not you have a valentine, crush, date, or ""significant other"" isn't really the point.  
Because Valentine's Day is not just about romantic love.  
It's about remembering those people that you care about and letting them know how you feel.  
Think about your family, friends, and anyone that you come into contact with from day to day. 
Let them know that you love and care about them.  
Also, don't forget the one Perfect Love: remember to thank God for His love...and let Him know that you love Him too!!

Tonight, after my extremely busy day (as all Tuesdays and Thursdays are), I went down to Scott Hall basement (that's the guys dorm) to watch ""Die Fledermaus"" (which is indeed an OPERA) on DVD with some of my friends.  Almost everyone that watched it is going to be in it for our opera scenes this year.  It's a really funny opera.  I'm playing Rosalinda, the wife of a man (Eisenstein) who is being sent to prison for 8 days because he called a policeman a ""donkey.""  But before he goes to jail, he decides to have a night of fun and go to a party hosted by a prince.  However, I know about it and go as well, disguised as a Hungarian countess (haha).  And I flirt with my own husband and succeed in catching him cheating on me...with...ME! It's really funny, if you followed that at all.  
But the point is, we all watched it and had fun singing our parts along with the video and laughing our heads off at some of the hilarious things we are going to have to do.  
Good times.  
So, we're doing that on 24-25 February, and I'm excited :) 
That's the main thing that I have to look forward to...most everything else going on is actually stressing me out lol

That's 10 pm on a Saturday night. 
PATHETIC! 
I want to do something Saturday night-ish...but I know that if I do, not only will I have procrastinated yet again on my work, but I'll also be exhausted.  
Just a list of all the things I have to do by the end of the week (this is mostly for my own benefit): 
~Do a writing assignment on a chapter of reading for Choral Conducting 
~Recite a song in German with correct pronunciation 
~Conduct a Russian choral piece while being able to sing or play any part while conducting and also pronouncing the Russian correctly 
~Be able to sing some French and German songs for my voice lessons
~Write a reflection on a speaker from a previous class 
~Write a choral arrangement of ""Blessed Assurance"" with piano accompaniment (and conduct it for the class to perform) 
~Do the book questions for 3 chapters of reading for Secondary Music Methods 
~Learn piano accompaniment of 3 songs for a girl's voice lesson
~Research and create a powerpoint presentation on discoveries in brain development and their implications for the classroom 
~Take a listening test as well as a written test on Beethoven and Schubert 
~Draw an illustration for a customer 
~Rehearse and perform in a chorale concert
This is excluding class and practicum attendance, practice time, work hours, and any other assignments I may be unaware of...all this by Friday.  
I think I wrote that out just so that I could get my thoughts in order.  Sorry for the bore.  
But at least now I'm putting it out there so that you guys will have something to tell the morgue when they are trying to figure out the cause of death.

Because tour was really fun and a good experience, just not as crazy as last year. 
Anyway, this past weekend I went to Peoria, Illinois for regional NATS.  
For those of you unaware, NATS is a singing competition and some of the voice students from my school went and competed.
I was actually still really tired vocally from the tour and also the change in weather had made my throat really dry.  I was so afraid I was going to suck.  
But once again, prayers were at work and I was somehow able to sing pretty well. 
I advance to the semi-final round, and actually some of my friends (Brent and Nathan) got into the top 3 in their divisions.  
It was a fun trip and we all got to know our voice professors a lot better (crazy kids).  
Other than that, the only updates I have are as follows: 
~I am so exhausted that I skipped two classes today just to get a normal amount of sleep.  
~I haven't exercised in about 3 weeks and I really REALLY need to.  
~I have tons of homework that I have yet to begin...and probably won't begin...
~I'm not going to eat anything again until November (HAHA!) 
~Happy Halloween!
~The fourth season of ""Gilmore Girls"" is airing on ABCFamily tomorrow and that makes me happy.  
~I'm pretty sure I'm going to have my senior recital on my birthday (which is April 3)...but don't quote me yet.

Seriously.  
Here I am, totally inadequate and it shouldn't even matter if I can or can't sing at a stupid Master Class, right? 
I mean there are so many other things going on in the world that God is probably concerned over...so why would he care about the quality of my voice? 
BECAUSE HE LOVES ME. 
That's why. 
He actually cares about all the little details in my life that seem so trivial.  
Let me tell you, today when I was getting ready to sing...I had no idea what sort of sound would come out of my mouth.  I had not been able to sing and it hurt when I talked all day.  
And even when I was singing, I was thinking, ""Man, I can do so much better than this...this is crap!"" 
But because of all the people that prayed for me and had faith in God, it all went so well.  
The lady that was critiquing came up and the first thing she said was, ""How old are you?"" 
I said, ""21..."" thinking ""Why the heck is she asking me this?!"" 
And she just paused then said, ""Well.  Someday, probably soon, you are going to play this part and you are going to do an amazing job, because this song sounds great in your voice.""  
WHAT??!?
I was so shocked.  I'm sure I blushed like 5 shades of red.  
But I was so relieved.  
They liked it, and they thought I sounded good, and I was able to share with dozens of people how much of a miracle it was that I was able to sing.  
And now I'm sharing it again with all of you.  
GOD IS AWESOME!!! 
He cares about me, and he also cares about you.  
If you ask him, he will come and help you.  Maybe not in the way you expected him to...but he will be there.  
He loves you and so do I.

I had to buy like 5 altogether.  
But for 17.5 credit hours and 10 courses, you have to admit that 5 books to buy isn't bad at all. 
The only book I really struggled with having to buy was this one book for a class called Content Area Reading.  It's a class that teaches us how to help kids ""read to learn, not just learn to read."" 
That's cool; I love to read.  And I fully support this whole idea. 
HOWEVER
I am a MUSIC education major.  
All you really read in music classes is...music. 
So I'm seeing the class as totally irrelevant, and the fact that it was my most expensive book made it kind of hard to justify.  
Oh well.  I'm not complaining. I mean it could have been a lot worse. 
The classes will all be fun though.

And lazy! 
This whole day went by and my room is still a disaster. 
I keep thinking, ""Oh I don't have to be finished until Thursday..."" 
But we did have an awesome thunderstorm today! 
Major flooding and the electricity went off three times.  
It was non-stop thunder!! 
And the flooding was quite interesting. 
Some friends and I were going to dinner when we saw a log floating down the road! 
It was hilarious :) 
And the double rainbow was really bright! 
I love weather like that! 
Anyway, I hope I get a lot more finished tomorrow than I did today...
Although, I did get my ""Phantom"" collection set up.  
So I'm happy for now

Thank you thank you thank you, Jesus! 
I have my own computer. 
My own computer that actually works. 
My own computer that, thanks to Evangel University, is now giving my high-speed internet access.  
Ahhhhh....
This is amazing. 
I'm here, in my dorm room, and I'm updating my LJ. 

Sorry, I'm still adjusting to this freedom.  
So for those of you just dying to hear about all the happenings in my life, be comforted and know that I will now have virtually unlimited opportunities to write.  
That is, until I start getting tons of homework.  
But until then, I can't wait to start reading and see what is happening in all of your lives!! :)

An opportunity to use the internet!
This is probably only about the third time this has happened all summer long.  
Being without access certainly makes you appreciate it more when you finally get on. 
Anyway, just wanted to let you guys know that I'm doing just fine here, up in Maine with some of my family...
Swimming and kayaking in the lake...
Swinging on the tree swing beside the lake...
Eating picnics, fishing, and having lots of fun at the lake...
Yeah. 
Don't worry about me.

I've been extremely busy with everything, from the opera to finals and moving out and stuff.  
The opera was amazing!  
I can't believe that I got to be a part of it! So many people came to it, and everyone loved it :) 
A lot of people had never seen an opera before, and they were pleasantly surprised to find that it was not boring...but it was actually interesting and funny.  
And I love being involved in stuff like this: putting on stage make-up, wearing beautiful costumes, and becoming someone else as I sing in the spotlight.  
*Sigh*
Yeah, it was great.  
But I'm also glad it is over, because it has taken up so much time and energy that I can now use to study, pack, or watch TV and lay around (which I have been doing frequently)
Just an update on the ""Phantom of the Opera,"" I have now seen it 13 times...11 in the movie theater, once on Broadway, and once in my room (today...it's on DVD!) :) 
I have been diagnosed as obsessed by my friends, and I'm sure that it is true.  But I don't mind. 
Only a few days until I get home!  I'm really excited about the summer but also really unsure as to what I will be doing.  Oh well, I guess I'll figure it out soon enough.  
I miss everyone, and I can't wait to see those of you in the general Hagerstown area :)"

We're going to have a lot of fun...especially because we will be going to the $2 movie theater to see ""Phantom of the Opera"" which they have NEVER seen!! (It will be my 10th viewing...sickening, is it not?)
LoL 
Anyway, in other news: 
At church, I used to greet for the college group on Sunday mornings but now I am in the choir so I can't do that anymore.  
And I NEVER see the people that I used to greet with because I'm up in the choir loft and get no social time (that and the fact that over 6,000 people attend my church on a regular basis)...
But, Sunday night, we had a special occasion where there was a big get-together after the service.  
And it was a huge crowd eating cookies, drinking coffee, and listening to a rock band (yes, old people too lol)  
When, out of nowhere, I see one of the guys that I used to greet with!  
He's pretty cool, and people say he looks like Jesus (haha like anyone could even know that) 
But yeah, he's got the nice ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" hair look going on--it's pretty sweet. 
Anyway, we talked for a while and it was fun.  

Thank you for listening to the ""random moment of my day"" story.

They did it two weekends in a row, and I saw it twice.  It was really good. 
My good friend Charity played Helen Keller, and she was amazing! 
She's a sophomore here, but she can totally pull off being 10 or 12 years old! 
Not to mention a blind and deaf 10 or 12 year old.  
The saddest part is that this was her first ever performance!! 
She's NEVER been in a play before, and she just auditioned at the last minute (she wasn't even going to) and got to play Helen Keller.  
I'm really happy for her, but it also makes me think of my own aspirations.  I love acting but it seems like anytime I audition or perform, I don't put everything I have into it because I'm all worried about what people will think.  
And that's STUPID.  
I need to just get in gear and not care if people think I'm a nerd or whatever.  
So, I guess that's what I learned over the past week...
Just thought I would share it with you.  
Also, I'm proud of myself because I've been doing a pretty good job of not eating junk food.  
I did have a dessert on my birthday because...well, come on.  
But other than that I haven't really been eating sweets that much (if at all). 
Plus, it's been a year and a half (maybe more) since I've had soda (or pop, whatever you call it).  
However...
Even though I've been disciplining myself in some areas, I'm definitely slacking in others.  
Such as HOMEWORK...and the state of my room...

I've had a really busy time.  
Anyway, I promised everyone I would fill them in about my Concert Choir tour...
So here it is (sorry to those who could care less): 
The tour was 10 days long and started in Michigan.  It was great because I got to stay in Detroit at my good friend Rebekah Walker's house with a big group of us.  I had been at her house last spring break so it was great to visit her family again.   
Then we headed to Ohio and Pennsylvania (where there was a gigantic blizzard but people still showed up).  In Pennsylvania I got to stay at the house of my friend that I work with here at Evangel.  She wasn't there but I got to meet her family and take crazy pictures and leave random notes in her bedroom HAHA 
And then we headed up the Northeast coast to Rhode Island and Massachusetts.  In Providence (Mona's hometown) I stayed with some of Emily Griswold's friends and we had a lot of fun!  Then we spent a day in Boston, where a few of us went to Cheers for lunch (good times).  In Haverhill, MA, my aunt Anna and my Grampa came to our concert and took me out to dinner!  It was SO good to see them (they only live an hour away from there, in Maine).  That night, Emily and I stayed at this awesome lady's house in New Hampshire.  She made us banana bread and chocolate chip cookies (and Yes, we definitely ate some cookie dough.)  We had a lot of fun with her photo shop program with the two high school girls that came over to spend the night.  From there, we headed back down for a few days in the Big Apple.  
That's right, we totally spent our free days in NYC.  It was great, because we had been working SO hard, we really needed a break.  
Some of my friends and I walked to Ground Zero from our hotel (then we got a limo because we were really tired of walking.  We split the price between all of us and we felt really cool).  Then we went to an awesome little Italian restaurant for dinner.  Our hotel has a diner on the main level, so I went there with some friends (for dessert lol) while a bunch of people went to Times Square (I was too tired.)  
I'm such a bum...I totally went to bed at like 11:00 pm the only night we were in Manhattan.  Isn't that sad? 
Anyway, the next morning, I slept in, and then I went to Chipotle for lunch, followed by a wonderful viewing of something called ""The Phantom of the Opera.""  :) It was really fun!! And a lot of people had never seen it (or any of New York for that matter) so they really enjoyed the whole experience!  After the show, we all stopped really quick to say hi to Mr. Morbitt (the guy that we know that plays Piangi in the cast!) but we had to hurry and get back because we had to get to...
HAGERSTOWN, MARYLAND!! 
I was so excited to go home and see my family, even though it was only for a few hours.  
We had a BLAST at my church and the concert and service went great! 
Thanks to those of you that came; it was so fun! (although it was really wierd seeing my two ""lives"" mixing, ya know?) 
After that the tour pretty much came to a close.  It was an AMAZING tour.  Some awesome times were had.  It was a great spiritual experience too.  The devotionals that we had everyday on the bus were really impacting, and all of our concerts meant something to us and our audiences.  We all became really close as a choir, and I'm sure I will never forget this trip :) 
Okay...
Sorry that was really long.  I have tons more I could say, but maybe I'll save that for next time!

Although, I can definitely tell you about the lovely cumulus congestus clouds that were out today, and how they were formed. 
Yeah, buddy. 
Anyway, in Lifetime Fitness (worse class of my life, what do you think??)we usually exercise on Mondays and Wednesdays and have lectures on Fridays.  
Well, Monday I skipped because: 
a) I have a toe injury (don't ask) 
b) My voice teacher cancelled my lesson and if I skipped I wouldn't have to get up until 10:30 as opposed to 7:30. 
c) I HATE THE CLASS!!! 
So, that was fun...and when I asked someone what I missed, she told me that we're having lecture tomorrow and NO CLASS on Friday! 
Jesus loves me, this I know...
And, I can't WAIT until Saturday, because then I'll be leaving for Concert Choir tour! :) 
And just so you all know...I totally have a ticket to ""The Phantom of the Opera"" on Broadway for next Saturday afternoon!!! (Lucky!)

It was wierd...I was in this counseling office or something, and this lady with a feathered 80's hairdo and really big glasses was sitting me down telling me she had something really important to tell me. 
Then, I'm sitting here on this couch as she tells me that, when I was a little girl, my mom and this guy's mom wrote up a contract on a napkin saying I had to marry him by such and such a day.  
Just when I thought the situation couldn't get any wierder (I know that's not a word), she asked me if I wanted to meet him. 
I said, ""What, is he here right now??"" 
And she said, ""Yeah, he's right in the next room...Come on in!"" 
And this other counselor lady comes in with a guy behind her, and he sits on the couch while they both tell us what's going on and what we're supposed to do. 
Yeah.
I don't know though.  Sometimes, I think that might just be easier.  Then I wouldn't have to worry about impressing people, or dating, or any of that stuff.

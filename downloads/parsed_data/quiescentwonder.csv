"event","I usually never remember my dreams, tonights was enough to wake me up and get me out of bed to write it down because it bothered me so much. I'm not going to post it as public because it contains some rather personal things but you can ask me for it if you want. I even feel kind of sick to my stomach. I spent an hour getting all the details right, and adding too it, changing this post around."

"event","So we go to a drumline competition (I'm not sure why) and I just decide I'll bring my entire spindle of CDs instead of having to go through and pick a few. We get back from the competition and Mr. Yao is talking to us in the tuba room. I leave me bag in there with a few batteries and my CDs in it. I leave the bag there and before I realize it, the door is locked and BAM. I can't get to my CDs, oh well. I can just get them on Tuesday right? BEEP BEEP * FUCKING WRONG! I got to school late today, just towards the end of second hour. By the time I realized that I should get my CDs it was a few minutes into third. I go into the tuba room and they arn't there, so around the band room I go. Hey look! One of my batteries, and a few minutes later, the other one! Good, there goes 50 something CDs, about a fourth of which we're origionals, and half of which were software. There goes $20 for the actual CDs, and thousands worth of software and audio.

I thought about it today, and I don't remember being happy. If I even have, I don't remember what it feels like. It just gets further and further away, I'm feeling rather hopeless."

"event","Well, my last entry was today, only it shows up in February. I'm still not asleep, obviously.

My backpack is still in Jeremy's car, along with some of my other stuff, I need to get it back tomorrow. If he had shown up for school today it wouldn't have been much of a problem.

I know mostly everything that's going on, I may have forgotten some of the stuff I have to do later in the week though. It hasn't quite hit me yet, which I think is why I'm very calm. I made a list of stuff that was good and bad. On the good side John found the Bari JDX mouthpeice in the back of the melaphone cabinet. It seems kind of odd to me that it would just end up there somehow. I'm still convinced that Sarah did it over the screws for the ligatures, which was kind of childish. It makes it even worse that I didn't have it for FBA, but we did good. I would have figured she'd have put it back in the case after this amount of time. The bad side of the paper had about four lines left on the page. I was thinking about just staying home for the rest of the week, and how nice it would be, but I know I couldn't do that. A good fourth of the page was this weeks schedule. Suessical, Drumline, and Pass-offs are what this weeks schedule consists of. Mr. Rosa told me today that I need to focus more on Symphonic Band then anything else. Pass-offs are tomorrow, today now, so I worked on those for about an hour today (yesterday) during the assembly. There is a Dumeline competition this saturday (which I need to learn Jessica's part for) following a car wash. I really need to work on the musical, James wants another person to join and help, I'm not sure if that's going to happen though. I don't know when I have time to do all this; the week is coming to a close too soon for me. I barely make it through every day, staring at the clock, waiting for the bell to ring so I can relax for a moment.

There are some things that are difficult to express in words, for me it seems to be more of the feeling depressed all the time. This is where Nine Inch Nails comes in, the song Leaving Hope seems to fit my mood perfectly right now. Jeremy has been saying recently how he mostly listens to depressing music and love songs, which kind of reminded me of myself. It's exaclty what I do, feel sorry for myself and try not to let anyone know. Most of the music I listen to is depressing or makes me depressed, it's not a bad thing. There isn't really any other music that can strike a chord in me, and I've listened to more than my fair share of music. I feel like I'll always be depressed, like it's part of who I am, and it's not going to change no matter what. ""happiness and peace of mind we're never meant for me.""

I know I'm going to be exhausted come tommorow night, I don't even know how I'm going to make it through the school day. Algebra II should be there for me to catch up on some sleep, we will probably just review for the semester exam, which is going to be mostly on slope and equasions, simple Algebra I stuff. I wish I was in a different class.

I'll add some more tomorrow."

Yep...

I'm hoping that the karma will catch up with me soon, I'm due for something pretty big."

"event","Yep, thats right, I spent an entire TWO MINUTES making that last Livejournal post all nice and tabbed out. Tabbed out with spaces, because when i press tab it moves to the next element. So yep, I'm happy about that. :-) (extreme sarcasm for the slow)."

"event","So now that Livejournal is free, and I'm extremely bored, I have a Livejournal account. Ah, but its free? There has to be some limitations to it. There are indeed 

Limitations:
     Limited customization of styles (I care?)
     No Livejournal Email Address (once again, I care?)
     No Directory Search (because I'm going to spend all my time searching 
          Livejournal for people who are interested in the same things as me, so I
          can talk with them online? I have better things to do.)

So basically I get a stripped down version of Livejournal. All the features I wouldn't use are gone. So, for free I get everything I want, and no extra shit. For a monthly price I get just what I want, plus some more stuff I will never use. Another thing thats great is that Livejournal is opensource, only you have to pay for it? I would host my own Livejournal with all the features for free if I wasn't such a lazy POS and decided to download Perl.

I'm thinking I'm just going to use this to write in when I'm either pissed off, or extremely unhappy. I've only writen once when I was extremely depressed, so it will probably mostly be just when I'm pissed off.

Excuse my bad grammer and spelling, if you don't want to, don't read."

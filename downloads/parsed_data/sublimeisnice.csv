"event","In life, if your truly Sad, no amount of money will fix that.  Sadness transcends wealth and success.  In the end, things don't always get better, sometimes you just have to deal with it.  You have to face life the way that it has turned out for you and deal with it.  Dwelling won't help(despite what Heidegger says!)  If you want to transcend Sadness, then you must first rise above the material.  Materiality will only get you so far.  Understanding that money is not an end is the first step in this process.  I had come to that conclusion a long time ago.  When I switched majors from Computer Engineering to Philosophy I had decided that money was simply a means.  And now, with large sums of money staring me in the face, just waiting to be taken, I understand that even more so then before.  In life, if you are truly Sad, no amount of money will fix that.  It is better to have mental riches than physical riches.  A lot of people will probably respond with something along the lines of ""If I was upset and I got a million dollars, I'd feel much better.""  Do you really think that?  I've said that before too, but do you really think that?  It sounds sappy and cliche, but will your money save you from a life of lonliness, heartache?  No.  Maybe it masks symptoms of Sadness, but anyone who is truly in sync with themselves can see thru that.  Money is just material, and humans are so much more than that.


In relationships there should be a certain amount of dissent.  No relationships are perfect.  Two imperfect beings can not create something perfect.  True love is wanting to fix any problems that arise, and actually doing it.  If there are no problems in a relationship then there are a few things that could be happening.  One or more parties involved may be totally dumb.  Most people have opinions on things and are willing to stand up for what they believe, if not, then your dumb.  And most sets of two people wont agree on everything in the world and this will lead to dissent.  Or the person might not have an opinion on anything, and in that case their dull.  Dull people are not worth being around.  It is the wanting and the fixing that makes love what it is.  If two people always say they love one another, and no problems never arose, then I would call them liars.  To me without the test there is no proof.(Take that Dr. Schwartz!)  I would rather be with the person I've gone with hard times with and succeeded then the one thats never had any problems, because theres no gaurentee then when problems arise you will be able to overcome them.  

But of course, I dont expect anyone to agree.  This is only my personal philosophy that has sprung from my mind that has gone through my life events.  And none of you have my mind or my life so you might not have any idea where I'm coming from.  But that is ok, I've become slightly more tolerant of other peoples opinions as of late and now I tend to only ridicule them in my head.  Unless your trying to talk about God, but I digress, back to the topic at hand.  

What is the topic again?  Life.  This is all life.  An ontological study of me.  What it is to be me.  Does anyone care?  I do.  You shouldn't, but I do.  

Ah life.  The great cosmic accident.  We could just as easily not be here.  But we are, so what do we do?  It would be so much easier if essence preceded existence.  Imagine what it's like to be a chair.  What do chairs do?  They just sit there(ironically).  Whoever invented the chair, made it with its use and purpose in mind.  Where does that leave us creatures that just came into existence?  That leaves us in an amazing position.  We get to create our own reason for being, and that is beautiful.  What do you exist for?  Do you know?  Have you ever thought about it?  It doesnt have to be the same forever, it can change at anytime.  It is ours to control.  At the moment I live for another being.  Making that being happy means everything to me, and in the end that makes me happy.  And in my eyes there is no greater good than my own happiness(props to john stuart mill).  Selfish, maybe.  It's who I am at this point in time.  Thats not to say the greater good doesnt ever come to my mind, but often times the greater good in the long run is better for me, than any immediate satisfaction.

This is all I have to say for now."

"event","An addict to what you may ask.  Emotion.  Believe it or not this despite my crusade for logic and reason, sometimes I get caught up in my emotions.  And by sometimes I mean a lot.  If I'm happy, then I am HAPPY.  If I am sad...well thats when the feelings of hate, jealousy, and pity all rear their ugly heasd.  Despite my best efforts to be reasonable, I get caught up in the real world sometimes, and it hurts.  I love two people in this world more than anything, but now that number is down to one.  Sheri made me feel more than anyone else, she was the ""wind beneath my wings.""  What do birds do when there's no more wind?  They have to fly on their own, or fall.  I don't want to fall.  The truth is, I want my wind back.  More than anything.  I don't see that happening, and I'm not going to force anything to happen.  This whole thing has really upset.  No matter how tough on the outside I seem...I am broken.  

I think I need some change.  Change is good right?  I'm thinking about doing something some might say is ""very drastic.""  I need to move, but I dont know if I can do that the way things are right now.  I need to leave this life behind.  How ironic.  

Without you, Sherilyn Fitzgerald, it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces.  No matter where I am, I will always love you."

People tell me I'm alive,
but I just don't feel it.
I'm on top of the world,
but something is different.
This thing I've become,
so empty and naked.

I'm not myself,
I'm hardly anyone at all.

It's a sickness inside,
you just can't see it.
I'd betray myself,
before anyone could see,
this thing I've become.
I'm alone and hating.

I'm not myself,
I'm hardly anyone at all.

Now everything is black.
I wade through broken glass.
I rip the shards from my back.
I stand with hope, I stand with hate.
I hope you'll come down.
Come down for me.

You can say that it's over,
but I won't believe it.
I won't stand alone.
Like that makes any difference.
This thing I've become,
is so sad and lonely.

Because;

No matter what I wrote,
I wrote for you.
No matter what I said,
I thought of you.

How true.

So i have ordered more drum stuff, bringing the grand total too....WAY TO MUCH FUCKING MONEY.

Hopefully i can stop being a spend-a-holic.

I havent really written in this for a long time.  Writers block?  Maybe.  Lack of anything to say?  Perhaps.  No inspiration?  Definetly.

Life has become an endless cycle of working.  No matter what I do I feel like its work.  I take pleasure in very little nowadays.  Seasonal depression?  Shouldn't it help me to write sad/angry/depressing things?

Guess not.

Caitlin ElizAbeth has called me a few times in the past week...very wierd circumstances.  I just don't know anymore.  

I think it's possible for people to become so emotionally detatched, that they literally don't give a shit about anything, even ""loved"" ones.  What the fuck is love.  And who the hell can define it?  No one.  And if you say you can, I gaurentee a million people disagree with you.  It's bullshit.  

Do I sound unhappy?  Cuz I'm not.  I just don't care anymore, I don't have any drive.  I'm comatose.  You can't feel in a coma, can you?

I need a revelation...some sort of awakening that shows me why I need to wake up in the morning. 

I want something new and different in my life, not this same old boring crap...I think I need friends...friends that live down here and that I can actually see so that I dont have to drive to warwick anytime I want to hang out with someone. Moving out here is one of THE crappiest things to happen in my life.  

I mean I have goals and ambitions with my philosophy and all of that, but that isnt a reason for me to get up, its just what i figure i will do when i get up.  

I want to wake up in the morning and be like YES TODAY IM GOING TO ____________!!!!!!

every morning i wake up....i go back to sleep.

People dont invite me to do things...they really never have...i have never gotten a phone call that went ""Hey nick we are going to do this, want to join us?""  In fact, as long as i can remember, the only person that calls me is sheri.  i wonder why.  am i just out of the loop?  am i not interesting enough?  do people just not think of it?  even dylan doesnt invite me to go do things, he has new entire groups of friends, ive never met...do i give off some sort of leave me alone vibe?  i love to be in small groups, but not alone.

the only plans i ever have are A) I corner dylan into saying hes not doing anything and i drive to see him  B) thursday nights when i go to see michelle and jen(it should be stated here that michelle has driven to see me also)  C) With sheri...which not that i dont like her cuz i obviously do but...it gets booooooring....

Heres a list of people that have ever driven to my house more than once:

Dylan
Sheri
Michelle

I'm sure theres good reasons for it, i just wonder what they are.

i sort of miss high school...the days when everyday i saw a ton of people, whether i liked them or not, i saw a big group of people.

I miss a lot of people sitting down here, 20(if your at uri) or 40(if your in warwick) miles away...

maybe i make too much out of this...for the most part you could easily say its because i dont really put effort behind it either, and when i do put effort behind it(to see michelle and jen and dylan and sheri) then it actually gets done...i just dont want to feel like i force myself there...

ive been in bryan and matts room twice this year, once with each of them, and each time i felt kinda weird, out of place, like they felt uncomfortable....i dunno, maybe im just retarded and am not open enough....

or maybe all these people dont really have time for me, maybe they have busy lives.

this is an interesting debate that could go on in my head for hours, but for the sake of my fingers i think i ll move on.

eh this is all i have for now, i was hoping if i just sat down and typed id come up with inspiration to write something , but it hasnt happened. 

plllllllllll.


the end."

Will i ever find lasting peace?  Inner peace.  A calm that not only flows inside but out; onto everyone else.  It can be seen by all.  Momentary peace is simple; useless.  The emptying of thoughts, reflection on that in your life which is good.  How do you extend that peace?  can you do it by days?  years?

i get these pains.  its a slight pressure in the back of my head.  it feels like my brain is saying ""thats it, ive had it, im out of here.""  and he just keeps banging away trying to get out.  Have you ever felt like your brain was trying to escape you?  will i ever find inner peace?

over 19 years i've had this pain 9 times.  4 times over the first 18 years and 5 in the last month.  and now its growing.  my temples throb, i get this insatiable urge to shut it out.  but i never can.

wandering is the only useful way to travel.  just wandering; aimlessly at first.  then you realize that nothing is aimless and that the aim of wandering is to absorb.  you ll discover amazing things.  when you wander you must walk slower, breath slower, think slower.  now look...everyone looks like they are going in fast forward.  you and the world can laugh as you wander.

if life was a race would i be winning or losing?  i dont understand the concept of failure.  if you fail; you've already found one way to not do something.  or youve realized that you dont know enough, and can go learn.  failure can open just as many doors as success."

could you check for monsters in my bed.
Can you look me in the eyes,                      
and see the voice inside my head?


prechorus(sung soft....in comes guitar and drums, the keyboard goes away, bass still with effect)


All the pain,
that transcends.
All the pain,
whos with me till the end?        
All the pain,
I'm asking, ""Will you
Liberate me!"" (echo on me, then pause maybe a second...just enough for things to fade)


chorus(scream.....bass loses effect, everything gets heavier)


I am the weaker half of you
tommorow we'll try again, ok?            
I am the stronger part of you
tommorow i hope we'll be destoryed...


{NEED MORE VERSES ....bass will do same thing as other verse, but this time the guitar and drums will be there}

(for this chorus just play it regular, but add a little ending thing onto it with the bass effect again, so it seems like its over)

I am the weaker half of you
tommorow we'll try again, ok?
i am the stronger part of you
tommorow i hope we'll be destoryed.


 bridge(probably sung softly ....just the bass)


You, and I,
having nothing left to hide.         
We can try,
to, tear down reason again


ending(make the prechorus heavier and scream, then go into the chorus then just stop)


All the pain,                          
that transcends,
no one's with me in the end.              
All the pain, 
that transcends,
no one can,
Liberate me.

I am the weaker half of you!
I am the weaker half of you!            
I am the weaker half of you!"

You would understand, but you can't.

I am not sorry that everything I know and think is genious, but all that comes out is nonsense.

"event","thank god school starts soon, im tired of working 40 hours a week.  sheris birthday is soon i have a few days off for that, i still need to buy her stuff, i have like $400 that should be plenty.  then after that i need to buy new hi hats, then recording equipment.  me and dylan have started doing a lot more work, leah didnt show up to our last scheduled practice nor did she call.  any reliable vocalists or guitarists out there want to jam with us sometime?  you dont have to be great, cuz we arent, but we do take it seriously.  Feel free to email at worthlessliar7@hotmail.com if you interested or want any information.  

we have about 6 nearly completed songs.  We only need a vocalist to help us get a feel for how they sound so we can fine tune everything.  if i can ill try to get some sound clips of me and dylan playing our songs up here, but unless we've gotten better recording equipment it will just be the guitar and drums parts cuz dylan cant play bass and guitar at the same time(bastard!)  or maybe we will record drums and bass, which ever way makes the song sound better, some are more bass oriented some guitar.   anyway........

thats all i really got say, band and work is my life right now."

"event","WARNING: If you don't care what I think about at 4 a.m. after nights of not sleeping, than please leave.  This is just a random excerpt from my notebook from a few days ago.  I occasionaly find my thoughts interesting and wish to share them, if you wish to read than enjoy, if not than thank you and have a nice die.(i hope you die)

Imagination.  Sometimes its too real to ignore.  Sometimes its to great to ignore.  My life is slowly turning into my imagination.  My reality is nothing bu duldrums in the Sea of Unrest.  Reality does in fact bite.  Casual sex, casual drugs, casual life.  Live when you feel like it.  Die when you don't.  Heaven is our own personal utopia, there is no God or supreme being.  Hell is full of fear, wants, and needs.  Hell the is real world.  But fear not, because there is a solution.  The mind can often times create images, ideas, etc. in such real ways, that the reality of the situation is, we don't know what is real and what isn't.  My fantasies have become so perfect, so me, that I can't help but constantly wander into them.  The whole idea seems crazy.  In fact, I'm sure it'd be a good definition of of crazy.  When one cannot tell fact from fantasy.  But this is such a subliminal state.  No one in that situation would ever call themselves crazy.  They are perfectly sane, they are choosing eternal bliss in a world full of shit.  Ignorance=bliss.  A man locked up in a padded room thinks he is really an American under cover agent trying to topple communists in Russia.  It's what he has always wanted to be, a great spy.  And now he is.  Is it better to know, or think you know?  It's an unanswerable question because no one can see both sides equally.  No one can see the beauty that each must offer.  I used to think badly of ignorance.  I used to think true, factual, provable knowledge was everything.  Am I being a hypocrite?  Do I want knowledge or happiness?  I used to think I could have both.  Then I realized, I either know the truth of the situation or the situation makes me happy.  Either or, never both.  The whole thing is mental suicide.
         You can't have imagination and knowledge.  Knowledge puts an end to daydreams.  Frued said something about it in a book I have.  Children(who would be considered unknowledgable) daydream, while adults(the knowledgable) do not.  They are made to think it evil.  When in fact they couldn't be farther from the truth.  My daydreaming, my thoughts make me happier(therefore not evil) than anything.  My imagination world is continuously making it harder for me to coexist in this real world.  My days are distracted by thoughts and visions, my nights are intolerable.  I don't sleep.  My mind sits and processes thousands of thoughts and hundreds of dreams, and if I'm lucky enough to fall asleep for long enough to enter that deep sleep/dream state, I can then see my dreams come ever more to life.  How sick am I?
         This has a lot to do with my ""I Wish I Was Locked in a Small White Room"" peom I wrote a while ago.  I can never put anything into words.  Everything I see, do, experience, think, or just pass by.  It's all lost forever.  I have neither the ability or intelligence to record it properly.  How can I change that?  It's 4 am and my vision is blurry.  The moth that was flying around me lap is gone.  It was white.  It was beautiful.  Beautifully ignorant in this hell infested universe.  I have little more to talk about now."

"event","so yea i waited till i had lots to say and lots i needed to remember for my post here, and here it is.

Ok, i got a job(finally, there are NO jobs in westerly) at blockbuster. its 7 an hour and i work like 20 hours a week so far.  that's more than a hundred dollars a week which is good cuz heres my list of things i need to buy in order:

New snares...as many strands as possible 42 if i can get it in the offset feature...if not i ll get the biggest offset one i can get.(anythings better than my crappy ass 12)  $10-15

new sticks...i want to try 2B's, i want to try some 7A's and i want to try some Sigs.  $50 ish

Double tom holder...so i dont need to mount them on my bass drum  $150

New Cymbals...definetly a new ride and new hi hats, if i end up with a pack maybe another crash...i'd also like to add a wuhan china...for these i need to hit p guitar center and spend a while playing around(note to self: try the paiste802's and the paiste alphas, try the sabian AAX, try meinl if they have(the rapid decay china), other chinas(or crash, i want something with no sustain)also try the paiste sigs, and the zildjian k customs)  $200 for ride  $200 for hats  $10 for china $150 for crash 

silencers...because i want them  $80

Stands...every cymbal i buy will need a stand or mount, depending on the number of cymbals  $200-$300

cowbell...just for variety $20

bass head...really could use a new bass head, maybe a new hoop also.  $60

snare...preferably the chad smith Pearl sig, but will try others. $200

MR8...only need 150 for this, ill probably split with dylan so we can record.

then finally!  i want to re finish my drums, im gonna pull the silver off and probably give it a natural wood finish...cost unknown


total(with me being very lenient):  $1310 ... more than 4 times the amount i spent on my orignal set, and brings my grand total of drumming purchases to a whooping $2300...and at $100 a week it will take me 13 weeks, thats a little more than 3 months...that should keep me set for at least year, then maybe more, or replacement cymbals, and ill def. need new heads and sticks...then maybe in a few years a new kit.

now with that out of the way you might ask is it worth it?  is your band going anywhere?  The answers are: yes. and  Not right now, but we're getting there. we have enough orignals for a demo, a few are closed to finished and a few arent...we are working on a few covers.

Outline of songs

song 1- has no words, the music is totally done...we want to spice it up, but its still done, and we can play with all the way through

This is because of you- all the words, all the guitar and bass, no drums yet im having a hell of a time with this one...will possibly leave it as pure acoustic, because we like it that way.

Cross eyed- has all the words, has all the bass and drums, perefectly done...no guitar...me and dylan can play it through no problem

song 4- this has an intro and a verse on all instruments...no chorus/bridge or breakdown(that i can remember) ...and no words

song  5- this is kind of a peppy song in comparison to the rest of ours, so far it has me and dylan (everything but a breakdown and structure) we still need leah and words.

Covers

Fight song by MM- we've all been practicing, havent played it together
Nobodies by MM- we've played it together, havent locked in yet.
lamb of god by MM- i dont think any of us have started it yet, but its not too hard.

yea lots of mariyln manson huh?  well me and dylan like it so plll...plus he fits our style i think, esp. lamb of god and nobodies...cuz i dunno we seem to write kinda heavy songs, but they tend to sound slow and sad...

We could really use a singer, it would help TONS...but we dont want to get someone thats all been in a band before and is like awesome cuz we dont really practice enough...i think we'd be best off with someone who sounds decent and just wants to do it for shits and giggles, since thats pretty much what we seem to be about...leah also wants another guitarist, i would like one so that we always can have a guitarist on hand, and cuz leah has a REALLY hard time writing stuff(sorry but you do), hopefully with the tape she has of all our recordings it makes it easier for her...it helped me a lot.

^^^^if anyones interested to try for those parts call me...315-2040...thats my house dont call my cell after june 26th its getting canceled, i hate cell phones.  or you could leave a comment, you could stop by for a practice, we practice in warwick now so its not 50 minutes away(used to play at my house) so you can stop by and listen if you like what you hear, you can try, if not then no harm done...we do everything the the band by a unanimous vote, but we'll need to discuss, so we 'll let you know asap  (REMEMBER: we are NOT great musicians but we try and have fun thats what its about...and for the singer you dont need to be able to write lyrics...iv written them so far for the songs we have words too and am working on others, it would be great if you did, but dont worry if you dont)

anyway beyond this band...all the equipment will help me better my self and improve my own abilities which will help this band, and any other one in the future...BTW we once again have a name....its Ig Alboc...we wanted something that meant something to us and wasnt just nonsense...but dont bother asking about it we took a vow silence.

yea all i ever have to talk about in my life is drumming and music...me and sheri are fantastic....so yea that sums that up"

"event","Ah, spring break.  I actually did a whole lot of ... not too much.  It wasn't an entire waste though, and to keep me from forgetting(thought i probably already ahve forgotten a lot) I will write it all here.  

Saturday was my birthday.  I went to Richards with my parents my sister and her boyfriend and sheri.  it was interesting.

Things I got for my birthday:
A book by Marquis de Sade from sheri
A Marilyn Manson action figure from sheri
An Orgy poster(with a really hot jay gordon, that will go right above the bed) from sheri
Drum Lessons from parents
A book full of ghost stories, ironically called Ghosts from sister
$150 from parents + grandparents
The new RATM DVD from michelle
Half off a dime from steph
Home made card from cait

AND TWO SUPER AWESOME HOMEMADE CARDS AND TEA BAGS FROM LINDSY 


I think thats it.  damn good considering last year...

After Richards me and sheri went to Leahs, for practice.  that was .... decent.  Not as good as i hoped, not as bad as i feared.  Leah didn't feel too good so i can understand her not wanting to practice as much, but it was still a let down.  We did however get some stuff done.

Stuff we got done:
We can play ""The Nobodies"" by marilyn manson
Our first song with no words has almost finished drums and ideas for lyrics.
our second song is stil stagnant with just guitar and lyrics.
I have a recording of the guitar parts that i dont have drums to yet so i can make them up at home.
**This didnt happen during the time at leahs though it relates**
Found more devices to record, also obtained sound editing equipment and am self training.

Now onto the none band happenings of my stay at leahs.

Ate pot brownies and me sheri and leah got majorly fucked up.
Tried the new steak sandwich at d angelos and fell in love
saw Passions of the christ

The movie was good...beyond the fact that it was christian propaganda to make those who have faith to feel more guilty and goto church and give them money, and to try and make those who dont have faith feel guilty and start going to church and giving them money.  It was the most brutal movie I've seen, the special effects/makeup/acting was done very well.  That is why i loved it.  I was not made to feel guilty.  I was the only one who left the theater that showing who wasnt in tear.  It is very strange to watch ghetto hispanics crying.  

So then i got home from leahs.  Me and sheri watched the following movies:

Wallace and Gromit: The wrong trousers
The X files
THe x files: Episodes from season 2
American history X
Mortal Kombat
Batman: the old school one
Fight Club
NIN: And all that could have been
  

i think thats it, it seemed like there were more, oh well

Over vacation i finished reading Bram Stoker's Dracula... and i cant decide on a paper topic, i have to write 5-pages backing up a reading of the text

Topics im choosing between:

Dracula being propaganda for the xenophobes of victorian england

or Dracula being Bram Stokers attempt at debunking christianity and the christian god

i will probably lean towards the second one, cuz i like to try and be controversial. (that and my english teacher is hot and id like to stay after class to ""discuss"" the idea with her)


yea so thats my break.

Things i have to look forward to:
drum lessons that im going to set up tommorow after school.
writing my english paper
seeing sheri again
practicing and finishing my and leahs songs
finding out about my job at the driving range this summer
GETTING MY CD BACK FROM CAIT(ahem, i called you twice this week and no one answered and you never called back... so call me i might be in warwick Friday for a while)"

"event","studying for nutrition is not fun, in fact i hate it....i hate nutrition....

sheri is dissecting her bra?  i dont even know what that means....

im actually starting to get a good feeling about practicing at leahs and of spring break as a whole...probably cuz me and sheri will do it a lot;)   brb i need another pepsi...ok here i am

but now sheris being mean and its making me cry;(  shes getting me the coolest presents ever... one is a philosophy book about sex and torture, and the other is a marilyn manson doll from the nobodies video


i really need to study

i have 2 outta 5 pages done for my dickinson paper, it has the worst intro ever, but gets better from there, i just need more body

woot, and i convinced sheri to rip off all her clothes and run around naked on my birthday for me... shes gonna kill me for saying this here

she shouldnt be ashamed to show her love for me and have everyone know, i am not ashamed of mine.  why, if it was her birthday i would glady rip off all my clothes for her

i have no idea why im still typing

i have to pee

i want to practice so bad why does it have to be midnight? 

my parents are getting me drum lessons for my birthday, that is a super score and a half...espeically since they are also hooking mycomputer up to the internet....

speaking of my parents, my dad bought a book called ""How to Talk to Anyone"" ...he thought he was slacking off at work(hes a salesman)  ...but the buying of the book happened to coincide exactly with the day he actually began having conversations with me...is it sad that my dad had to buy a book to be able to talk to me?   i guess its cool that he showed effort...and cool is a thing my dad rarely shows
its just funny that for a living he talks to people and is all friendly and civil and sells things, but he cant talk to his son.... wierdo

everyone should read the poem America by Allen Ginsberg.....hes a russian, and it is one of my favorite poems ever, its kind of reminiscent of a RATM song...haha i said that in class and only like 2 people knew who Rage were....actually thats not funny, thats kinda sad:(  fucking ghetto rap fuckers(although they should sorta like rage too)

anyway

over spring break im going to smoke up sheri for the first time, that should be fun, and ill get to break in Mr. Happy Bong(the bubbler that leah made me)   

her me and leah all stoned at once, and me and leah probably trying to practice, that will be funny as hell

leah you still have to tell me if your having a big (drunken) party cuz i dont want my drums to be there for that, so im gonna show up after it ....if your not having one maybe me and sheri will come over during the day on monday or something and we can celebrate the day of my birth after me and her get home from whatever restaurent we decide to goto ....well whatever im done typing and am going to call the woman now...

"event","Spring break is coming up.  Which means I have a 5 page paper due in 3 days and I don't understand the question.  I also have a nutrition project due, but the online program we use doesn't have half the food I eat in it.  And I have an exam in that class too.  F all of that.

Spring break is coming up.  Which means my birthday is in only 6 days.  And all I want are bandmembers that can STAY THE FUCK focused.  But I won't get that.  I'll get some silly little present from my sister, probably a book.  And my parents will put a CD player in my car, when I told them to just hook my computer up to the internet like they said thy'd be doing in the middle of Feb. anyway.  And no one else will get me anything.

Spring break is coming up.  Which means I will be spending 10 days with Sheri soon.  And Leah's parents are going away so I might bring my drums to her house to try and practice.  There is no way she can not show up or be late if it's at her house, is there?  And if Dylan can get his dick out of his girlfriend for 10 minutes or get his eyes off everquest maybe he can be there, and maybe even ... come up with something.  But none of that will happen.  I will show up with my drums, things wil go wrong, and I will leave angry.  Which means I will be a jerk to Sheri, who will then get mad at me, and Spring Break will end up sucking ass.

Spring break is coming up.  And I am going down."

i beat old school mario 1 twice tonight, which was cool cuz iv never beaten it before, now iv beaten 6 different mario games, woot?

i wrote a paper called ""Flaws of the Expert Opinions of the Essence of Women""   it was about the topic of women in romantic poetry, i liked it it was fun.  would have been much better if i spent more than one day on it but oh well, i think i still did good. i had a mishap this morning and missed logic , but i got there in time to get my quiz back, 75, not bad considering i forgot how to convert and obvert statements.  and my 90 avgs. it out.  my poetry class is blowing nuts, the teacher just sucks.  and for our mid term i need to answer some stupid question with a 5-7 page essay, but her questions are ridculous and will never take that long, and than i have to write my own poem and write a 1-2 page analysis, of it .  i already wrote it, but i think im gonna change it slightly, its a 21 line blank verse poem about jesus being crucified in the first person.  but i want to change it to a heroic couplet to get it to sound sing songy and happy.

leah got me into two bands; evergreen terrace and remembering never, and now im going to go waste money buying all their other CDs.  i dont have room for more CDs.  i also want more radiohead cds.  i dont have room for more CDs.  i also dont have the money for more CDs.  anyway...

this was the first valentines day in 4 years i havent had to buy someone something.  good cuz i didnt have the money.  i spent the weekend at ric with sheri.  we saw butterfly effect again, well i saw it again she saw it for the first time, then we went to go get her belly button pierced, it looks pretty sweet.  so the day was still good cuz i still got to spend with someone special

lol dating.com makes me laugh, everyone should go and join it , its free and easy to waste hours on.  its a good time passer.

im trying to get a full time job as a manager at a driving range near my house, 40 + hours a week at 10 bucks an hour, that will give me plenty of money to move out with next year.  and if i dont get that im hoping to get the one where all i have to do is drive around getting balls, only 6.75 but still worth it and i can still do it full time.  i really need to start my community service if im looking to not get suspended by the end of this semester pllllllllllllllll f that

what an ironic gift that was.  (dont worry no one is suppose to understand that.)


i think most man are an island unto themselves, but i seem to be a planet.  both positionaly and as a matter of size, my ambitions are big(read: i have delusions of granduer)

i love you.  i love you.  and i love you.  oh yea and i love you.  i love you all.  unfortunatly(or fortuantly) love means nothing to me anymore, because to those i love it means nothing.  ( thats aimed at about 18 different people)  

i dont even know what i think it is anymore, but i dont like it.  the problem is i become to attached to everything and everyONE.  and i dont know what i actually feel, i dont know what it should feel like.  i've been in nonstop relationships for like 4 years.  my life always revolved around someone else, and now theres no one.  whether they believed it or not, my life was always very girlfriend-centric.  thats how i have to be.  i cant honestly revolve around myself, because i dont know what to do.  

maybe alone is what i need, to grow into me.  wait i cant do that with my dad breathing down my neck about every decision i make in life, and the fact that its wrong.  i dont WANT anybody.  i NEED somebody.  and its sad.  it really is.


more than anything right now, i want leah to open up to me and be like a best friend i never had or to date have.  because together we could do great things( intellectually and  NOT sexually, this isnt me lusting after her)

and that last part might make some of you think of dylan.  dylan was your best friend wasnt he?  well no i dont think so, and i dont mean it insultingly, let me explain why.

i always felt one of us was doing something wrong.  at first(read: till last year)  we never opened up at all, 0, ziltch, nada.  but then the day came that i told him i liked guys, i think that was when i began to tell him things, open up with more things(maybe it had to do with going to a phsyc. for the first time?)  but yea, he was there and he listend.  but to date he has never come to me with a problem.  i dont think HE sees us as a 'best-friend' unit.  i dont know why.  but i wont doubt that he has always been there for me and always will be.

but in all seriousness i dont think i trusthim 100% with everything.  

1 person in this world knows me through an through, she knows everything iv done, and why or why not, she knows what i plan, she helps me see things clearly, shes the only person that knows this entire intricate set of lies that my life is built on.  she may not know all the past details of things i will tell her, but that comes with time ya know.  this paragraph is dedicated to michelle pugh.  i trust her more than anyone.  to everyone else, that means that yes, iv lied to you/are lying to you/will lie to you when and how it suits my needs.  i am a bad person.  i dont try to hurt people, i just try to make everything the best possible situation for me.  (not too good at it am i?)  

ive become insatiable, everything i get is only half of what i want  and this has become to long so im posting it."

I want to go home,
take two aspirin,
snort 2 lines,
smoke 2 joints,
and never call you again.
I want you to forget I exist.
I want to break even.
Live day by day,
die minute by minute,
and lose myself.
I want to forget that I exist.
Find a dead end job,
stick to meaningless relationships,
so I'll always have a reason to complain.
I always think that every moment that passes can't possibly be worst than the last and every moment I am wrong.
My life is already over.
But I still think, therefore I still am.
If I don't think,
then I am not.
I am not.
I am not.
I am not... you.
I am...
not...
you...

I want to forget that I exist.

I forgot.
I forgot about you.
And I forgot that I exist."

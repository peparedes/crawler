"event","1. What did you do in 2009 that you'd never done before? Got a blackberry and a Facebook account

2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year? I don't think I made any for 2009, but my resolution for 2010 is definitely to get into business school and leave Kaplan (or at least stop working there full-time and just work there part-time while I go to school)

3. Did anyone close to you give birth? Just a few people from work - I still have another couple of years in me!

4. Did anyone close to you die? Trevor's grandpa

5. What countries did you visit? No new countries, but I did visit Bozeman and Yellowstone, which was amazing.

6. What would you like to have in 2010 that you lacked in 2009? A job that I didn't hate, but like I said my plan now is to go to business school full-time and stop working for a while.

7. What date from 2009 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? Dec 29 because it is the day that Trevor's grandfather passed away.

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year? I did get a nice promotion at work, even if it makes me miserable most days.  I am proud that I have kept my body in shape and have been ED-free.

9. What was your biggest failure? You know, I don't think I have had any big failures - maybe failing the NYPD psychological.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury? No - I have felt truly healthy this year for the most part.

11. What was the best thing you bought? A few nice dinners out for me and Trevor - Blue Stone Hill Farms was my favorite.

12. Whose behavior merited celebration? Trevor, as always.  And his family and my.  We are very lucky.

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed? Barak Obama has let me down.

14. Where did most of your money go? The house!  Still paying off the mortgage - only another 25 or so years to go.  We were very lucky this year to be comfortable financially.

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about? My new promotion, hiking Yellowstone.

16. What song will always remind you of 2009? ""We weren't born to follow"" by Bon Jovi and ""Boom Boom Pow""

17. Compared to this time last year, are you happier or sadder? richer or poorer? I am probably less happy because my work is much more stressful - but it does make me richer, and I am starting to feel more in control of my destiny.

18. What do you wish you'd done more of? More  fun day trips - to places in the city, or just drives around.  There is so much to see around here that I always feel like I am missing out on something.
More time studying for the GMAT so that I can really ace it!

19. What do you wish you'd done less of? Definitely less time hating my job and coming home and thinking about how much I hate my job.

20. How will you be spending Christmas? We spent Christmas Eve with Trevor's family and Christmas day and my grandparents/

21. Did you fall in love in 2009? We just celebrated our 5 year wedding anniversary.

22. How many one night stands? None, thank you!

23. What was your favorite TV program?  Nurse Jackie is my new favorite from this year, plus Californication and Project Runway and Top Chef.

24. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year? Nah, a few people that irk me but nobody that I truly hate.

25. What was the best book you read? The 12th Edition Official Guide to the GMAT.

26. What was your greatest musical discovery? I don't think I discovered Lady Gaga, but she makes me laugh.

27. What did you want and get? A promotion to Senior Manager - and then one to Director.

28. What did you want and not get? A job outside of Kaplan, preferably at St. Charles.

29. What was your favorite film of this year? Eek - maybe He's Just Not that Into you.

30. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you? I turned 28 this year, and me and Trevor celebrated at Max Brenner.

31. What's one thing that would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? Leaving Kaplan, starting business school, getting pregnant.  But all this will come in time.

32. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2009? Feminine, sexy, professional.

33. What kept you sane? My Trevor, crossword puzzles, working with people who make me laugh.

34. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most? They mostly make me want to puke.  I like Gabriel Byrne.  He is cute and has a sexy accent, and I know nothing about his personal life.

35. What political issue stirred you the most? Abortion - and the fact that the government thinks they should pay for women's abortions.

36. Who did you miss? All my friends who have moved away and that I only see like twice a year.

37. Who was the best new person you met? Cyricia - who I hope to make my associate manager.  She helps keep work sane.

38. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2009: Create your own destiny.

39. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year: 
""Come on and get up off your knees.
When life is a bitter pill to swallow you gotta hold on to what you believe.""

40. Quote a general source (movie, book, comic book, etc.) that either rings true to you, or sums up the year: 

Eek, I feel so out of it."

"event","So, my rock bottom was 80 pounds - I told myself that I wouldn't let my weight go lower than 85, but I guess an eating disorder is all about lying to yourself anyway - and lying to everyone else.  I am trying to gain weight now, but I know I am still eating then than I should.  I am eating almost twice as much as I was a couple of weeks ago, but being as I was down to 400 -500 calories a day I guess this is only a slight improvement.  But I hate how I look now, and I realize how much I hurt everyone.  Like my mom, and Trevor, and my grandmother.  When my mom told me how scared my grandma was and how worried she was about me, it just broke my heart - here, my grandma is in the hospital on oxygen in intensive care and she is worried about me.  That was the moment when it all clicked, that I knew I have to get myself better.  Right after hearing that, I went out and got ice cream, and the next morning I went out and had an entire bagel for breakfast.  But, after eating the bagel and for the whole morning I felt kind of sick because my body was just not used to getting that much food all at once, and since then I have convinced myself that my body is rejecting food and that it is no use to eat anyone because it will just make me feel sick.  I have been eating a normal dinner every day, but just less for breakfast and lunch.  I just find that I don't crave food and honestly I want to weight more, but I am sort of scared of eating.  Maybe I am scared of not having an eating disorder.  Like, if I give this up I won't know who I am.

My goal is to be 95 pounds - I feel like that will be a healthy weight.  I will be skinny, but will look normal at least and my skin won't be hanging off of me.  I want to be able to wear adult size clothing and have it fit me, and I want to look attractive again and feel sexy.  Maybe I am scared of feeling sexy.  Being this thin sort of makes me invisible to guys - I don't get whistled at or get catcalls from construction workers and I don't get hit on.  I feel safer, younger, more protected.  We'll see where it goes, or how it goes.  I'll report back soon."

"event","So, I had a dream last night where I was raped again.  This time I was at a pool with two girls that I was apparently friends with in my dream - and we were kind of kissing each other, but in a teasing way not really a sexual way.  And then this guy came along all of the sudden and just like accused us of trying to arouse him by kissing each other, and said that we were purposefully trying to turn him on even though we did not know he was there.  And then he raped me by the side of the pool, and the two girls that I was with did nothing to stop him - and if I remember correctly I think that they ran away.  It was strange, though - when he started to rape me, I closed my eyes and I just stopped feeling anything when my eyes were closed.  I still knew that he was raping me, and I was still terrified, but it didn't hurt, physically.  I stayed asleep during the whole rape, and then I woke up shortly after it was over when my alarm clock went off.

I have to stop having these dreams."

"event","Which is very good news.  I have had this bump on my leg for two years (yes, I know that I should have had this checked out two years ago) and then last week I saw this article in Glamor that showed a picture of a basal cell carcinoma that looked suspiciously like the bump on my leg (yes, I know that Glamor is probably not the best place to get information on cancer).  Finally, I got worried enough to see a dermatologist - who quickly deciphered that it was not a tumor, but a dermatofibroma, which is essentially a bug bite that scars and never heals properly and never goes away unless you have it surgically removed.  And, oddly enough I did not hate the dermatologist - although it was a little weird - after he told me I wasn't dying of cancer, he asked me if I wanted to take off my clothes so he could check the rest of my body for suspicious marks.  Maybe I have become too leery of people after living in NY for so many years, but isn't that a little sleezy-sounding.   Yes, yes, I thought so too."

"event","So, I have hatched a mini-plan to get myself promoted.  There is this one 5-person team at Kaplan that is kind of co-managed by 2 managers, and also by me in my role as an Associate Manager.  But I feel like it would be much stronger if it actually had one full-time manager who's job it was to ensure the success of that team.  So, I suggested to my manager that he suggest to his manager that I get promoted to sole manager of that department.  I am very proud of myself that I asserted myself and said - hey, I want to get promoted, here's a position that I know I would rock in.  So, we'll see what happens.  I don't expect anything to happen any time soon, but I think I am totally awesome.

Speaking of totally awesome people, everyone needs to go about and get the new Pink album ""I'm Not Dead.""  It is so good, so honest, so sexy.  Love it."

It is on my neck; it is a flower, like a lily-type flower, although I cannot be sure what type of flower it is.  But it is just the bud, no stem or anything too big, and my hair does cover it, so hopefully grandpa will not happen across it.  It is pink and pretty and wonderful."

"event","As always, there are crazy protesters outside of my building.  The Falun Gong nuts are a regular fixture, but today there are new protestors!  They are protesting Google's new Chinese website, www.google.cn (I should mention that Google's corporate headquarters are in the 23rd floor of my building).  Unlike Google's American counterpart, the Chinese Google is heavily censored.  So, if someone searches for, say, Tiananmen Square, they get all these articles about tourism in the Tiananmen Square area, as opposed to articles about the Tiananmen Square massacre.  It is actually pretty fun to play around with the site - like to load google.com in one window and google.cn in another window and do the same search in each and compare what sites the two come up with.  And these are the rare protestors that I can actually sympathize with, but why why why must they be so LOUD.  I know that they want to make sure that Google can hear them up on the 23rd floor, but don't they realize that the people on floor 1 - 22 are hearing them MUCH louder.  I am sure the people working in Liz Claiborne's offices don't really care about their cause.

Grrr..sick of angry protestors."

"event","Ok, first the great news.  Trevor finally ( after like a year and a half ) got a call from the FBi asking him to come in for his next phase of interviewing/testing.  So, he has until February 10th to prepare for that, and then probably another month or so to prepare for the physical - and then comes the background check, full medical, an interview with me, and then he can be an FBI agent-in-training. YEAH! I am so happy for my Trevor.  

My eh news is that my promotion goes into effect this Sunday - meaning that I will start my management duties by managing the entire floor this Sunday by myself.  This includes all sorts of fun things such as taking angry escalations, making sure all the computers, and servers and phones are working properly, making sure everyone comes in to work - and begging people to work overtime if other people call out sick, oh and somehow trying to get all of the work done that I normally get done.  We'll see how this goes.  I thought I was going to be eased into it, but nope.  I guess this is a sign that they have a lot of faith in me, but still I would have liked a little time to get acclimated to things.  Oh, well.

I will be sure to post after Sunday - hopefully I will not have a concussion from banging my head against my desk."

So, I have already met this goal, and the year is not ever a week old.  Yesterday, I was randomly offered a permanent management (or associate management position).  I will still be working in my current department, but will be a manager in the department that I was acting manager from September - November.  YEEEAAAAHHHH!  I actually have a title now, and I got a $3,500 raise, and I HAVE THREE WEEKS VACATION!  OK, must stop being so excited about this.  I am sure in a few weeks time, I will not be nearly as excited (like when I have a screaming, crazy, SAT mom on the phone), but I still think that it is a great opportunity.  And, really the thing that I was happiest about was that they just randomly thought of me for this position, and honestly just created the position specifically for me, since a position like this has never really been in existence.

"event","I figured that the chances of anything too exciting happening in the next 11 days are slim, and since work is slow today, now is the perfect time to reflect on the year gone by.


1. What did you do in 2005 that you'd never done before? I got to be an acting manager at Kaplan.  Even though I wasn't really in that position, I had to act for a time as if I was.  Surprisingly enough, people actually looked to me for guidance (and to take escalations :( and I liked the feeling of being in charge.  Other than that, I got to interview people for the first time - and got to make a hiring decision for the first time.  


2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year? Ok, so I never made a New Year's resolution last year.  I don't plan on making any this year either.  I figure that I am so close to perfect, that if I got any better, I might just be too good.


3. Did anyone close to you give birth? Eh, couple of people at work had kids - nobody too interesting, though


4. Did anyone close to you die? No

5. What countries did you visit? I went to the Bahamas this year - heaven.

6. What would you like to have in 2006 that you lacked in 2005? I would like to have a permanent management position - and thus three weeks vacation (two weeks is not enough time).  It is really hard to think of things that I want.  I mean, I would like to own my own house, but I doubt that will happen this year.

7. What date from 2004 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? I would have to say August 15, 2005 - our one-year anniversary.  It was a perfect anniversary, and it really feels like we are an established couple now, and not just newlyweds anymore.  December 1st still sticks in my mind as the day when everything almost fell apart, but I know now that we will be ok. 

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year? I don't want to focus on work so much, but I feel like I have been really successful in my new position at work.  I know that it wasn't so much of a promotion as a lateral move, but I am technically in a position of greater importance, and have lately gotten to be a part of a few interesting products.  Tomorrow I get to train two of the new-hires for three hours, which I am excited about.  I feel that my current job really suits me, even though I have been worked to the bone lately, and that I am doing my job as well as anyone could do this position. 

9. What was your biggest failure? I feel bad that I don't cook much anymore - I used to cook almost every day, and now I can't find the time.  I also feel kind of bad that I have stopped working out.  There was a point where people could actually see my arm muscles without me trying to make a muscle, and now I am just back to basically being skinny with fat around all the right places, which is good, but I liked my muscularish self too.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury? Haven't had so much as a cold.  My gyno appt is in a week and a half, though.  I'll report back after that.  I am also thinking of having an HIV test - just cause I've never had one.

11. What was the best thing you bought? Mmm...well, my favorite thing I got this year was my iPod, but Trevor bought that for me.  OOh, I bought myself America the Book, by Jon Stewart, which I love and have read repeatedly.  

12. Whose behavior merited celebration? I am going to have to go with Trevor again.  Again, for not leaving me when a lesser man would have, and for being so genuinely loving and understanding.

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed? A few people I guess.  At work, M. and S.K. definitely got on my nerves.  In world/local news - Bush, Hilary Clinton (if she becomes president I swear I will throw myself out a window), Roger Toussaint - MTA Union President (he is really at the top of my shit list right now)

14. Where did most of your money go? Rent.

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about? My honeymoon.  That was the first time I got to plan my own vacation, and I really felt like I was on my own, like me and Trevor were adults, like we were in charge of our own destiny.  I can't wait to plan a vacation for next year.

16. What song will always remind you of 2004? ""Sleeps with Butterflies"" by Tori Amos, ""Gold Digger"" by Kanye West

17. Compared to this time last year, are you happier or sadder? richer or poorer? I am happier.  I like my job even more than I did last year, I am happy with my relationship with Trevor and feel that it has grown stronger, I am more confident in myself, and I am happy with my relationships with the important people in my life.  I am actually a little richer.  All of the overtime that I have logged has paid off, and I got a raise of $2,500 over what I was making last year, and I think that Trevor is making like $7,000 or so more.

18. What do you wish you'd done more of? Sunbathed, spent time outside, gone to the beach, played the keyboard, played board games with Trevor.

19. What do you wish you'd done less of? Less time spent lying in bed trying to fall asleep (ok, I don't have too much control over that, but I drives me insane), less time spent reading the paper during my lunch break instead of talking to people and being social, less time spent being angry for things that happened in the past and that I cannot change. 

20. How will you be spending Christmas? I will be going to Trevor's grandparents on Christmas Eve, and my grandparents on Christmas Day. 

21. Did you fall in love in 2005? I think I fell in love with Trevor once again.

22. How many one night stands? Last year I copped out of this question by saying ""I am a married woman.""  In reality, last year I did have a one-night stand.  This year, I am happy to report that I have had none.

23. What was your favorite TV program? America's Next Top Model

24. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year? I don't think so.  I am not a hateful person.  There are a lot of public figures who really push my buttons, but I don't think I would say that I hate any of them.

25. What was the best book you read? ""America: The Book,"" by Jon Stewart, and ""Eats, Shoots and Leaves,"" by Lynn Truss

26. What was your greatest musical discovery? I have started to get into PJ Harvey lately.  Now, she was obviously discovered a long time ago, but I had no idea who she was until very recently.

27. What did you want and get? My new position at Kaplan. 

28. What did you want and not get? To make a life plan.  I have decided that I can afford to take another few years to really iron out a plan.  Things are going well, so there is no reason to muck them up.

29. What was your favourite film of this year? Spanglish

30. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you? I turned 24.  Me and Trevor went over his grandparents, and we had dinner, and they bought me a black forest cake and we all had cake together.  I had already gotten all of my presents before my birthday, so I did not have much to open.

31. What's one thing that would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? I think I would like to have a plan.  You know, where do I want to be in five years - what do I want my career path to be, what is my passion - that kind of thing.

32. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2004? hot pink and super sexy, and sometimes professional

33. What kept you sane? Becoming friends with more people from work

34. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most? I have this weird crush on Lenny Kravitz lately, but mainly I have stopped crushing on celebrities.

35. What political issue stirred you the most? Lately, abortion - how it is looked upon as a type of birth control by many liberals, and how there is no middle ground between people who want to abolish abortion completely, and those who think women should get pregnant just so that they can assert their ""right"" to get an abortion.

36. Who did you miss? I miss talking to Jarett.  I definitely feel bad that we have fallen out of touch. 

37. Who was the best new person you met? I didn't meet Gabriel or Demetri this year - technically I knew them last year, but it wasn't until this year that I really got to get to know either of them.  They are both fabulous, and I feel that I am learning a lot by working with them.

38. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2005: Life is what you make of it.  We all choose every day whether to be happy or miserable, successful or a failure.

39. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year: From Madonna's ""Like it or Not""
This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
Cus I'm never gonna stop

From ""Sleeps with Butterflies""
I'm not like the girls that you've known
But I believe I'm worth coming home to

40. Quote a general source (movie, book, comic book, etc.) that either rings true to you, or sums up the year:
I am too out of what is going on in popular culture to answer this one."

"event","and it hit me like a club.

Being that I dream so infrequently, it would be nice if my dreams could be a little less excruciating.  My dream started out normally - I was at my family reunion that my dad's family has every other Thanksgiving.  For some reason, I was planning on having my gynecologist appointment while at the reunion - I had apparently been refusing to go, so my family made her come up there.  Oddly enough, my gynecologist was a woman in my dreams, even though I wouldn't go to a femle gynecologist if my life depended on it.  So, I agreed to have my appointment later in the day, right before we were supposed to have dinner.   We go into another room - I undress.  And all of the sudden, she climbs on top of me, and I feel her strength, and she takes off her pants, and I see that she has a penis, and she starts to rape me.  I know that my family is in the other room, so I try to scream because I see that she/he has a rope that she/he is about to strangle me with, and I want to scream before I get strangled - but I can't scream.  Like, I try, but all that comes out is this wimpy scream that people in the next room wouldn't be able to hear.  After the rope is almost secure - I manage to scream, and at this point I woke up.  

So, I never got to find out if anyone saved me.  The most terrifying part was that I was not able to scream, and therefore not able to take care of myself.  I wanted to - and it wouldn't have been so easy to prevent him/her from raping me, but I just couldn't scream.  It's like, I could just be raped (again), and I would (still) not be able to protect myself.  The other message that I took away from it, oddly enough, is that you can't trust most women, because a woman could look like one thing, but be something else entirely."

Monday was one of the rare days lately where it was less than 90 degrees and less than 99% humidity, so it was the perfect day to take a nice mile-long stroll to Tavern on the Green.  It was even nice enough for us to sit outside and enjoy a really perfect dinner.  Trevor surprised me by ordering a cake ahead of time, so after we were done with dinner they put balloons on the table and brought over a cake and ordered to sing ( i declined).  I ate the frosting and filling out of my cake (which is basically what I always do with cake) and then Trevor, in all of his wonderfulness, switched plates with me so that I could have his frosting and filling.  Ooh, it was very good.  And, we got to take the rest of the cake home with us, so I have been gradually scraping the frosting away every day.  I have been thinking about how fast this year went, and how much it has gone better than I expected.  I know that sounds horrible, but everyone says that the first year is the hardest, and I fully expected myself to do something to fuck it up, but things have been great between us lately and I love being married.  I think we are both doing really well with all of it, and we have a great life ahead of us."

To me, a journal should be a place to record your most private thoughts, someplace you could just vent all the thoughts and emotions running through your head that you could never tell anybody.  This whole online journal thing is just voyeuristic and seems fake, or put upon.  Like you are writing things that you expect people to read and you are therefore inhibited by it.  I miss keeping a paper journal that I know nobody could ever read, someplace that was a safe haven for me.  There are times where I miss having that piece of paper to talk to - to tell all those things that I could never tell a real person to.  I guess maybe I should think of this as a blog - not a livejournal.  Blogs are amorphous and not necessarily supposed to have a character of their own, or to give any insight into who you are.  I don't know - I am just being a bitch now and complaining, but all I am saying is that I wish it were safe for me to have a real journal."

"event","So, yesterday was Stephanie's last day at Kaplan - so we all went out to celebrate ( ok, I guess we really went out to wish her goodbye - I may have been one of the few people celebrating that she was leaving).  Anyway, we went to this bar/lounge called the Irish Rogue, which was very wonderful.  It had a second floor that was somewhat hidden, so we all went up there and basically had the floor to ourselves - and there was a pool table and darts and couches so it was a very comfy hanging out type place.  I had a surprisingly great time and talked to a few people that I have worked with for over a year, but barely said more than hello to - so I was proud of myself for branching out a little bit.  Then, I tried to join in on Sander and Demetri's conversation, but I am so unbelievably intimidated by Demetri, even through (and probably because) he is so incredibly nice, but also because he is just so smart and I always want to make a good impression on him, so I end up saying absolutely nothing because I am afraid of saying something dumb.  This is obviously not a good strategy for me (and Sander and I subsequently had an hour long conversation over a shot of whiskey - yes it took me an hour to finish a shot of whiskey) about why I should not be so intimidated by him and why it will hurt me in the long run.  Basically Sander convinced me, and I have to say that he actually is right, that Demetri is much more socially inept that I am, has no friends to speak of outside of Kaplan, and is a workaholic - and that Demetri has at least as much to gain from us being on friendly relations as I do.  So, maybe with all the hundreds of hours of overtime I will be working I can find some time to say something to him besides - Hello, good morning, and how are you.
Well, I let you know over the next week how that is going for me. Ugh, I can't believe I have to go back to work tomorrow.  Even though I had a great time last night, it didn't feel like I had a whole weekend because I saw work people on Friday.

"event","So, my department at work now is me, Gabriel (my manager), and Stephanie.  Nice, little cozy department.   Unfortunately, Stephanie's last day is tomorrow - she is leaving Kaplan to pursue her PhD in creative writing at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.  I am not a big fan of Stephanie as a person - just cause she is kind of like one of those people who feels like she knows everything and I get the impression that she feels threatened by me (because I of course know much more than she does - HAHA!) 
Anyhow, she is leaving tomorrow, and the girl who will most likely replace her would not be starting until around September 15.  Now, if our department had 15 or 20 people like most of the other departments at Kaplan, this would not be so terrible, but to lose 1/3 of our staff is decidedly not good.  AND - August 15 - October 15 is Back To School (BTS) time at Kaplan and is a blackout period for all employees, meaning that nobody can take vacation time during these two months because it is by far our busiest time.  So, we'll see what happens.  As of right now, Gabriel has asked me to work 8 hours of overtime a week (how me working 8 hours is equivalent to someone else working 40 hours is a mystery to me), but it might end up being like 12 - 16 on some really busy weeks, provided of course that I am willing to work 55 or so hours a week.  

Now, I am very willing to make a little extra money, but I just know that by the time October 15 rolls around, I am going to be entirely burnt out - although it seems like I will have a plethora of extra money with which to keep myself amused.  Definitely planning on taking a week off the third week of October.  Since today is the last day that both me and Stephanie will be here, I have to take it easy a little bit.  I will have plenty of opportunity to work my sexy little tail off later."

I got pleasantly buzzed on Red Bull and vodka, which is good, except that even though I went home at an almost reasonable hour an went to sleep by like 1:30, I woke up the next morning at 5:45, even though I didn't have to be awake until 7:00.  I think my body still had scary amounts of caffeine running through it and was resistant to sleeping.  So, I decided to actually get up at 5:45 and do some work on the 1,500 piece jigsaw puzzle that I have been tackling.  Unforunately, my little energy buzz kept me going until like halfway through Sunday when I completely crashed.  Sunday and Monday night I have no great reason for not getting enough sleep except that I stayed watching painfully addicting shows on VH1, and then just couldn't fall asleep until forever.  

Argh, there is this crazy rally outside that is driving me crazy - it is just so noisy.  There are about 2,000 Jewish people in orange shirts typing up traffic on Broadway, and I have no idea what they are rallying about.

It could so easily happen here, and I just feel like I am trapped because I have to take the subway every day and can't just be like - oh, well the subway isn't safe, I'll find another way to get to work.  When I went to get on the M train, there were cops at the M train - the M train!  In my informal survey of nyers, 90% of them had not even heard of this line - I feel like it would be the last subway line that anyone would ever want to bomb because it is so obscure, and there were cops there.  And then, when I got out at Essex/Delancy to transfer to the F, there were 5 cops there, and then when I got out at Bryant Park, forget about it.  It was like every step involved in me getting to work just got more and more ominous.  Getting stuck on the subway and having to walk the tracks is probably one of my biggest fears, but for the train to be bombed and to be stuck inside a subway tunnel - or even worse, if the M was bombed, since it's an el, we would all be stuck up there or worse the tracks could collapse and we could all plummet...

"event","So, Trevor downloaded this new ""video game"" called Yourself Fitness.  It is really cool - you take a little fitness assessment in the beginning and put in your weight and height so she knows how fit or unfit you are.  And then you set up a workout schedule for yourself and the workout bitch (her name is actually Maya) yells at you if you don't meet the schedule you have set out.  Maya is a semi-cute animated figure who tries to motivate you and does all the exercises with you.  I was liking Maya a lot up until this past Friday when I decided to do her lower body workout, thinking that it would work my entire lower body.  Instead, she made me do lunges for 45 minutes and I can barely walk now.  Subway stairs were entirely too difficult and now I have missed a workout because she worked me too hard on Friday!  grrr..but i am actually enjoying it - I have been kinda lazy lately - except for my morning walks to the M and my walks to get Italian Ices (I don't really count it as exercise if my goal is to get junk food) I basically sit down all day long.   So, I am going to try to make up for my missed session tonight to get back on schedule.

Other than that, my big news is that I died my hair black.  I thought it would make me look all dark and mysterious and sexy, which is does, but it is just awfully dark (funny how I never thought black would be this dark).  But, I like my new look.

And I have to give a big congratulations to Antoniette and Greg! yeah! congrats on the upcoming (well, 2 years away) nuptuals and here's to many happy years"

"event","So, I am back from the Bahamas.  My vacation was absolutely amazing, although I do seem to be allergic to the Bahamas.  My last few days there I was broken out in hives, which are only now starting to go away, but lets not focus on that. It felt really great to be away from work for a while and have some time to recharge, and just loaf in the sun and swim and not have any sort of schedule or responsibilities.  And I am very excited to be back at work today because it is incredibly slow and probably will be tomorrow as well because of Memorial Day.
I am very happy to report that I was able to successfully SCUBA-dive, which was awesome.  First we took an hour lesson in like three feet of water at the hotel, which I almost didn't make it through.  I kept accidentally swallowing water and I was having trouble using all the equipment, and crazy as this sounds having all the SCUBA gear on somehow reminded me of 9/11 and I felt like I was preparing for some sort of scaring chemical attack and I started having a whole panic attack, but I got through it.  Then, after that we actually went diving in the middle of the Atlantic.  We took a boat out and did two like 30 minute - 45 minute dives at a maximum depth of 27 feet.  It was really cool cause the instructor people brought fish food with them so that the fish would come swim with us and we got to see these gorgeous coral reefs, so I was really glad that we did it.
Besides that, most of the week was spent poolside, except for some time we spent in the casino there the last couple of days.  Surprisingly enough, we did ok in the casino.  I won about $25 playing nickle ""Wheel of Fortune,"" and Trevor won about $200 playing three-card poker.
I was very happy to hear that it was freezing in NY while I was gone, so I seemed to have a picked a perfect week to go away.  And even though everyone I talk to seems to think that I would never want to leave the Bahamas, I was ready to come home.  I was very excited to be able to shower in my own shower and have New York pizza and be back in my own bed.  :)

As for what I am thankful for - an amazing honeymoon.  ;)"

Honestly my favorite part was that I won a $20 gift certificate to Virgin Records for my part in this group thing that we did to create the ideal vision of customer service at Kaplan, but we also did learn a few good things, and it was a good way to kind of refresh us all and get us out of that almost summer don't want to be stuck at work on a beautiful day rut.

One of the ideas that the leader brought to our attention was to start a gratitude journal.  Now, I had heard this on Oprah before, but kind of discredited it because honestly Oprah has everything to be grateful for and seemingly few problems, so I didn't really think much of it.  But hearing it yesterday from the lady at Kaplan it made more sense.

So, I am going to try it - to write down a few things each day that I am grateful for, to kind of get me out a the recurring funk I have been in and to keep myself looking on the bright side of things.

For today - here is what I am greatful for:
-My $20 gift certificate to Virgin
-The hour-long business writing workshop that I have later this afternoon that will get me away from my desk for a while
-That tomorrow I am leaving for the Bahamas for a week
-That on my frozen yogurt card I get a free frozen yogurt today
-That Trevor drove me to the train station, so I got to work nice and early and had time to sit and read the newspaper before starting work
-That ""The Apprentice"" season finale is on tonight
-That it is such a beautiful sunny day in NYC today"

"event","I called out sick today, and honestly I was not feeling good when I woke up this morning.  I'd only had like 5 hours of sleep and my stomach hurt and I just really didn't want to go to work.  This is very uncharachteristic of me, especially since I also called out sick this past Sunday. 

Here is my Top 10 List of Reasons why I should call out sick:

1.  Kaplan gives me 6 sick days a year, that I lose at the end of the year.  If I don't use them, they are gone forever.
2.  I do not get paid for unused sick days.
3.  It costs me more money to go to work than to stay home.  If I go to work, it costs me $3.60 round trip, plus the inevitable cup of Starbucks or something that I end up buying during lunch.
4.  An unexpected day off is just wonderful.  So far all I have done today is nap, work on my jigsaw puzzle, and read another chapter of Henry Kissinger's ""Years of Renewal.""
5.  I don't want to be burned out when I leave for vacation.
6.  It is important to stay home at the slightest hint of a cold so that it does not get worse, and so that it is not spread to poor, innocent, coworkers.
7.  They already gave me the promotion, so they can't take it away.
8.  It is nice and sunny out today, and there hasn't been a really beautiful day in New York in a while.
9.  There are some people who have already used all 6 days, so it still makes me look good by comparison to only have used 2 so far this year.
10. I want to, and I should be able to do whatever I want."

"event","Whew, after a year at Kaplan, I finally got a promotion.  I am now going to be in Kaplan's Academic Support team.  Mainly what I will be doing is answering customer emails who have academic kind of qusetions about the material with their GMAT, GRE, SAT, ACT, or pre-high school exams (silly exams that most people have not heard of that you take to get into super-fancy high schools or boarding schools like the ISEE, the NYSHS, the SSAT), but it will also involve some customer service kind of stuff and I will be doing backup (hopefully not to often) for the department that I have been with now.  And I got a $1,500 raise, which is not significant, but good nonetheless, and my job will be less stressful and hopefully more interesting.  Good news all around.

Ugly Children May Get Parental Short Shrift
By NICHOLAS BAKALAR 
 
arents would certainly deny it, but Canadian researchers have made a startling assertion: parents take better care of pretty children than they do ugly ones. 

Researchers at the University of Alberta carefully observed how parents treated their children during trips to the supermarket. They found that physical attractiveness made a big difference.

The researchers noted if the parents belted their youngsters into the grocery cart seat, how often the parents' attention lapsed and the number of times the children were allowed to engage in potentially dangerous activities like standing up in the shopping cart. They also rated each child's physical attractiveness on a 10-point scale.

The findings, not yet published, were presented at the Warren E. Kalbach Population Conference in Edmonton, Alberta.

When it came to buckling up, pretty and ugly children were treated in starkly different ways, with seat belt use increasing in direct proportion to attractiveness. When a woman was in charge, 4 percent of the homeliest children were strapped in compared with 13.3 percent of the most attractive children. The difference was even more acute when fathers led the shopping expedition - in those cases, none of the least attractive children were secured with seat belts, while 12.5 percent of the prettiest children were.

Homely children were also more often out of sight of their parents, and they were more often allowed to wander more than 10 feet away.

Age - of parent and child - also played a role. Younger adults were more likely to buckle their children into the seat, and younger children were more often buckled in. Older adults, in contrast, were inclined to let children wander out of sight and more likely to allow them to engage in physically dangerous activities.

Although the researchers were unsure why, good-looking boys were usually kept in closer proximity to the adults taking care of them than were pretty girls. The researchers speculated that girls might be considered more competent and better able to act independently than boys of the same age. The researchers made more than 400 observations of child-parent interactions in 14 supermarkets. 

Dr. W. Andrew Harrell, executive director of the Population Research Laboratory at the University of Alberta and the leader of the research team, sees an evolutionary reason for the findings: pretty children, he says, represent the best genetic legacy, and therefore they get more care. 

Not all experts agree. Dr. Frans de Waal, a professor of psychology at Emory University, said he was skeptical. 

""The question,"" he said, ""is whether ugly people have fewer offspring than handsome people. I doubt it very much. If the number of offspring are the same for these two categories, there's absolutely no evolutionary reason for parents to invest less in ugly kids.""

Dr. Robert Sternberg, professor of psychology and education at Yale, said he saw problems in Dr. Harrell's method and conclusions, for example, not considering socioeconomic status. 

""Wealthier parents can feed, clothe and take care of their children better due to greater resources,"" Dr. Sternberg said, possibly making them more attractive. ""The link to evolutionary theory is speculative.""

But Dr. Harrell said the importance of physical attractiveness ""cuts across social class, income and education.""

""Like lots of animals, we tend to parcel out our resources on the basis of value,"" he said. ""Maybe we can't always articulate that, but in fact we do it. There are a lot of things that make a person more valuable, and physical attractiveness may be one of them."""

Friday night when I was out at Antoniette's benefit revue my throat starting hurting and by the time I got home I had practically no voice.  Anyway, thanks to two days basically loafing around like a lump and tons of ludens cough drops, I am mostly better.

So, yes.  I got close to no sleep last night.  I watched the L word at 10 like I always do on Sunday night and during the episode Jennie gave a speech to the creepy guy living with her and Shane during which she pointed out to him that every woman is violated by a man at some point in her life.  And I got to thinking about it and it is really true - that in one way or another, every woman is violated either sexually, emotionally, physically by a man - usually a man who is very close to her.  So I was thinking about how that can effect you, and wondering whether men have the same experience.

Do all men feel like at some point in their life that they have been violated by an important woman that they've known?

Just a question I am throwing out there."

"event","Ok, first the bad news.  I took the Jeopardy test today and I am not going to be on the show any time soon.  After taking the test, I felt like I rocked it.  There were 50 questions and I am almost sure that I did not get more than 10 wrong, but of the 100 or so people in the room with me, only 4 passed.  The fact that so few people made it, and the fact that many of the people in the room had taken the test several times before helped to lesson the blow, but I am still a little bummed.
On to the good news, on May 20th me and Trevor are finally leaving for our honeymoon.  We are going to be spending 7 nights/8 days in the Bahamas at the beautiful Atlantis resort.  From the website is looks absolutely amazing - just white beaches and pools and scuba diving and relaxing.  I absolutely can not wait to finally get away for a little bit and for the two of us to really just have some time to ourselves, which has become increasingly rare.  It will be the perfect opportunity for us to just reconnect and focus on each other and not have a million other things going on.

So, no Jeopardy (at least not for another year when I can take the test again), but I have a lot to be thankful for."

Anyway, I am feeling pretty good.  I got an email from Jeopardy yesterday inviting me to come in and audition for the show.  I am so excited - I have dreamed about being on Jeopardy since I was like 10 (yes, I am a dork - that has already been verified), but I know I am going to be so disappointed if I do not make it.  A friend of mine went to audition a couple of years ago and he was telling me yesterday how hard it is.  Basically, you stand in front of a judge and the judge asks you 20 questions - face to face - and you have to try and answer as many as you can.  He described the people at the auditions as being less cool than comic book collectors but not nearly as scary as people who speak fluent Klingon.  Supposedly most of the people who try out are like trivia junkies - I feel like I have a lot of useless information in my head, but I don't know if it is enough.  I am going to study from my Trivial Pursuit Cards ( which will probably make Trevor not want to play Trivial Pursuit with me any more since I will know all of the answers) and I am going to try to religiously read the NY Times and the Wall Street Journal, although very few of the questions on the show are related to current events. 
So, we'll see what happens.  I just bought a cute pink skirt today that I am planning on wearing to the audition.  From what I've seen, they don't seem to take looks into account at all, but I would have no problem just trying to flirt my way onto the show :)

Tragicallyhip24: on friday, demetri asked me who i was talking about and i said you
Tragicallyhip24: he also told me he is not sure about the position yet and what they are doing
Tragicallyhip24: he said that if he decided to fill it 
Tragicallyhip24: he would put out an email
Tragicallyhip24: to all i guess, but then he said something about andrea mentioning to him that I wanted to get off the phone and not talk as much
Tragicallyhip24: so i said i would be interested i just didn't know if i would be good enough to get the job
Tragicallyhip24: i don't even know if i will apply but would you be mad if i did?
BevinBull: no, not at all
Tragicallyhip24: really?
BevinBull: no, i mean it is up to demetri to hire whoever he thinks best fits what he is looking for, so i couldn't be mad at you if he preferred you
Tragicallyhip24: Not that I have any ability to write like you  AT ALL!
Tragicallyhip24: i thought about this all weekend and I was so scared to say something to you
Tragicallyhip24: i don't feel like you are mean or spiteful, but i don't wnat you to think i am going behind your back
Tragicallyhip24: you are one of the only friends i have here
Tragicallyhip24: and i don't want to hurt that
BevinBull: no, of course you are not going behind my back - i mean, you just told me about it right now.  i mean, obviously i would love to get the job too, but you are just as qualified.
BevinBull: i wouldn't feel like i was competing with you at all 
Tragicallyhip24: okay... good
Tragicallyhip24: 

Ok, so first of all I am an idiot for not saying outright that I would be a little (or a lot ) upset with her if she applied, being that she had asked Demetri (without me asking her to ask him) about the position because she knew that it was something I was very interested in.  And, ok, I will admit that Demetri approached her about it, and asked her if she was interested in the job, but I feel like when I talked to her about it she said ""oh, bevin you would be perfecet, I would do anything to help you get the job,"" so in my mind, when Demetri asked her about it, she should have said, I am not interested, but Bevin would be perfect for the position.
I know I am obviously biased in this because I really want to get a new job, and that is one of the jobs I would most like to have at Kaplan, but like we just went out last week and had this whole long conversation about how I feel like woman are mostly backstabbers and they will say one thing to your face and then go and do something completely different.  And I said that I wasn't pointing a finger at her, but that in my experience, woman have been extrememly judgemental towards me, and are much more duplicitous and two-faced, and that I generally make it a point to have mainly male friends and acquaintances because even though men have hurt me in the past, in a way I have always seen it coming. And it is completely obvious that when she says ""i don't even know if I would apply,"" that what she really means is that she knows she is going to apply and would do it one way or the other, but just doesn't want to feel guilty about it.  And the truth is that I feel like I am much more qualified, but Andrea likes her much better and I feel like because of that reason Marianna has a slight advantage - and I would feel resentful for her if she got the job.

I just wish that when I asked her about the position (being that she knew about it before I did since the person leaving is her roommate) that she would have said - listen bevin, i want to make this clear that there is a possibility I would want to apply as well.

So, I guess what I have to do now is just wait for Demetri to send out an email asking for applicants, and the second I get that email I will be ready with a perfect cover letter and resume, and I will kill at my interview, and do everything I can.

Yes, I am just as bad as she is for lying to her and saying i wouldn't mind, and saying that I wouldn't feel competitve, since obviously I will feel competitive and act even more so, but oh well. now I see her more as a woman and less as a friend, and I don't think that could be changed."

"event","Reading Tori's book and listening to her new album and her old albums, I really feel like she is an old friend, like she understands things about me, things I may not even understand myself yet, but she helps me to validate them.  And, yet it is this kind of safe relationship because she is at a distance and she will never really know me.  I don't know, I am just philosophizing I guess.

I just figure I would include an excerpt from her book that just kind of hit home, even though pasting it here probably won't have the same impact as reading it as part of her book, but here it is...

""It all has to come out some way unless you find a way to say, 'No, I'm one person, I let my hair down, I have a good time with my friends, I put my hair back up, but either way I'm the same person - I just have different sides.'
Shpes with different sides...the hexagon.  The honeycomb, a structure of hexagonal cells constructed from beeswax.""

It goes on from there, but there was just something about reading that, about how someone really seems to understand that I feel like there are completely different aspects of me, that meet, but are on opposite sides.  Like, there is the person I am around people at work, with my family, with Trevor, with my friends, with men - and all of them are so different.  And I feel guilty sometimes because there is nobody who really fully knows me, and just something about reading what Tori said, kind of validated that for me - as if to say, it's ok. Like, it is not that I shut off parts of myself around certain people, but that I really have certain sides of me that are only present at certain times.  It's almost impossible for me to explain here, but I hope that someone gets it."

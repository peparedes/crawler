P4CM stands for Passion for Christ Movement. Fine, another religious movement to go along with the hundreds of others and they haven't actually done anything to aggravate me (aside from substituting the number ""4"" for the word ""for"" God, I hate that. The only place that should be done is on a license plate.) But they sell t-shirts with ""ex-whatever"" written on them. I'm vaguely amused at the idea of wearing one ironically. (Though the ex-fornicator one would be true enough, I am married.) I think the ex-masturbater needs to have ""but really frustrated"" in small print beneath it. 

There's an ex-homosexual shirt that I started to rant about, but decided that I was putting way more thought into it than it deserved. Functioning brain cells are at a premium and there's more important I could be burning brain power on."

I got to Westover and went through the flurry of paperwork for deployment. And then everything came to full stop while the Air Force figured out how to get us to Little Rock.

"event","<lj user=""dwarven_brewer""> had his take on the Summer Olympics which reminded me of my own thoughts that were churning. None my thoughts are really original, as I'm sure that countless other people have had the same thoughts since the Olympics started.

A lot has to do with some of the events that are considered sports. Like beach volley ball and badminton. These are barely sports, anything that's played in my backyard during a barbecue should not be in the Olympics. There should be beer, overcooked hamburgers, undercooked hotdogs, and alcoholic relatives who may or may not be angry drunks. Conversely, if the IOC includes these ""sports,"" why not include horseshoes or bocce? Hell, lawn darts, I'd love to be able to buy a set of lawn darts again. (My grandmother used to have a set, but I didn't get the chance to ask her about them before she moved to VA.)

I wanted to watch a badminton match, just to see how it was played at the Olympic level, but it's a hard game to find. I dvr'd a 6 hour block that was supposed to include badminton, but the bulk of it was track events, specifically the marathon. It's impressive to be able to run that far that fast, but man, is it boring to watch. I ff'd through all of that, until the equestrian events, which Paige wanted to watch and then I lost interest. I'll have to check it out online or something.

Water-polo? Why not turn it into real polo and add horses. Be a lot more interesting than what it is now.

Table Tennis? Ping-pong, I can play in my basement. I know the Chinese are proud that they're really good at it, but I'll start showing interest when they can beat the US foosball team. And where is my Olympic air hockey? How about darts? or arcade golf or mini golf. (I wonder what the Swedish women's mini-putt team looks like.) What's the criteria for Olympic sports? Could we see Olympic chess? Checkers? Backgammon? How about Chutes and Ladders or Candyland? How much money do I have to toss at the IOC to get Go Fish as an Olympic sport"

But they're taking applications from almost the entire Air Force Reserve and the application included an essay on why I should be selected to go to Tunisia. I hate essay questions, particularly the ones where I have to present myself like this. I spent all day Sunday at drill trying to write the stupid thing. Sadly, my ego does not extend to making myself look good on paper. I got it written and turned in after sign out. Hopefully, it's not as painful to read as it was to write. 

The one thing on the application that might help get me get selected is unfortunately something I loathe more than writing about myself: NBC (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare or CBRNE, as the Air Force calls it, adding Radiological and explosives to the acronym. Seems a bit redundant to me.) I'm glad I got the training, but it's really a huge pain in the ass to deal with. And the thought of spending ten days in North Africa decontaminating simulations really doesn't thrill. It's hot in the suits, difficult to drink water, you can't eat (or pee or anything else you would normally unzip for) and everything else is made 8x more cumbersome. 

In short, I have a decent chance of being selected, but it'll probably be for something I dislike. I have a very slim chance of being selected for Air Evac, which is something I enjoy. Oh, well, I'll try to remember to keep things posted as I find out."

So now I'm going to be E-5 Staff Sargent (E-4 used to be Sargent in the Air Force and parts of the DOD are still confused about what my actual rank was at E-4. Probably has something to do with how wrong it feels to move from being a Corporal to Senior Airman)

The last time I was promoted was in April of 2000. Yeah, 8 years. Most people do their entire military service in that time, including the Inactive Ready Reserve, where you get to sit at home, fat and happy, praying that WWIII doesn't break out (or invade yet another country before we finish mucking about in the first two. Although, between stop-loss and deployments that extend contracts I don't think there are too many people sitting IRR right now anyway) Hell, my time with the Marines fits nicely within that time frame. (In reality, there's some overlap, since I didn't get out until Dec 2002.) I just happy to finally get my NCO status back. At least the time to E-6 (Tech Sargent) is only a year to a year and a half. 

Coinciding with the promotion, the Air Force has decided that after 4 years of training, I should actually get to do my job. I'll be in Germany for a week in May preparing to fly patients back to Andrews AFB. I'm happy about since it's what I joined up to do. There's also possible deployments coming down the line for the fall, so we'll see what kind of fun times that brings."

"event","Paige woke up suddenly and wanted me to look up Equine Herpes Virus type I. I didn't even know Horses could get herpes. (Apparently, cows, too.) There was an out break in Florida last week and bunch of horses died. It was from a European horse that traveled through NY and she was worried that it could get passed on to her horses via one of us if we could be carriers. (Most likely her, since I don't go to horse shows that often.) But lo and behold, EHV-1 is only transmitted from horse to horse. 

Other news... last Friday Paige got to hear the heartbeat of the little spud. (Trying to think of an endearing nickname other than to keep calling it ""Fetus."" Something that hasn't been used yet. People keep wanting to use ""Spawn."" But We're not fish, dammit!) No ultrasound yet, not till February, I guess. I have to wait another month before I know what the sex is. 

And awhile back I asked you guys for words. You guys gave me a bunch of good ones. Well, the words were for a card game I'm working on and I finally got to play test it on Thursday. It still needs a bit of work and I'll be updating progress on this as it comes along. My goal is to get it into a  ""fine tuning"" by Genericon. Doubt I'll make it, but maybe I'll get close."

12: okay, well, didn't know she drummed, but nothing odd about that
11: er, close... should be fiddler's fiddling. (fiddling's such a goofy word)
10: His head, it blots out the sun. It's like an eclipse. (Inside joke that where 'Hatte's the only on here that'll get it.)
9: Have actually seen  <lj user=""sskipstress""> dancing. Though if I saw nine of her, I must've been pretty drunk.
8: Milking? Okay, I could use some more milk. (Paige baked a ton of cookies this year and I ran out of milk eating    them.)
7: It's a writing journal, how it's swimming, I don't know.
6: Heh, that sound's so dirty.
5: Any other other name probably would've worked, but the meme had to go and grab the one of the few two    syllable names on my list. (And I keep thinking ""with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes."" I cannot remember    what nursery rhyme that comes from.)
4: I read this and I see Dan as the four kings in a card deck. Don't know why. Maybe it's the beard.
3: Jen's cool, we need to have more of her around.
2: Not that I have any real desire to see auto-fellating unicorns, but it was something that I saw in somebody else's    LJ that I thought was bizarre and twisted enough to be an interest. (And now I have two of them.)
1: We should be so lucky to only have one LJ meme. (But then, what would 3/4 of the people on LJ post about?)"

Plus I'm kinda curious as to what we're actually supposed to for All Saints Day. I know it was supposed to be a response to Halloween. I'm trying to figure how this was marketed to pagans. ""No, no, it's like Samwain, just you don't dress up as demons or play with gourds or get any treats or get to play any tricks. You get to... uh...dress up as your favorite Saint and...um, here have a communion wafer."" This would explain why All Saints Day seems to be marginalized, while Halloween is still pretty popular. But which Saint would I dress up as? Has Mother Theresa been canonized, yet? I bet I can get a nun costume pretty cheap today. Barring that, I guess Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration. Not really a saint, huh? Damn, St Cristopher, then.
Or I can take the easy way out like I always do with my Halloween costumes and go as St Nicholas."

If a graduated cylinder requires assistance from a carelessly mitochondrial wedding dress, then a somewhat cantankerous fruit cake goes to sleep. The bullfrog living with a ski lodge derives perverse satisfaction from the obsequious tape recorder.

If the minivan about a pine cone usually competes with a mortician over the support group, then a skyscraper hides. Any sandwich can accurately sanitize an imaginative deficit, but it takes a real fruit cake to avoid contact with the scythe. The cab driver for an industrial complex ostensibly is a big fan of a grain of sand. A hockey player seeks a steam engine. Now and then, an asteroid near a paper napkin pees on the boiled warranty.

It's a white 2006 Hyundai Elantra with a 5-speed manual transmission. The stick shift was a bitch to find. Turns out, it was one of only two new cars on the lot and the other one was an extremley low end base model with no options what so ever.

I had been planning on saving my pennies and buying a VW Jetta TDI in a few years, but my Explorer decided that reverse was no longer a necessary gear. (Reverse, Neutral and Drive all pushed the car forward.) The Jetta was about 10k more than I could afford right now. (Not to mention that you can't even buy diesel vehicles in NY right now. Not only that, if you could get a new diesel, you wouldn't be able to put fuel in it right now. I'm not entirely sure why, but all the pumps have these stickers saying that the diesel may wreck the engines of all 2007 and newer vehicles.

Yeah, silly. Is anyone really going to argue whether Johnny Depp is hotter than I am? I'm actually quite cool right now, but it's 2am and I have a fan blowing on me. Depp's in LA (I think, or did he repatriate to Paris or something?) Whatever. I'm definitely going to issue those shock collars, though. Engvall's got his signs, I'm gonna give out a couple thousand volts and several deci-amps. (No idea how much amperage it takes to actually kill a person, but it's not much.) Oh, well, I'll post again when I have something more meaningful to say."

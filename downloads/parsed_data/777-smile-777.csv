I need your arms around me, 
I need to feel your touch, 
I need your understanding, I need your love, 
So much, 

You tell me that you love me so, 
You tell me that you care, 
But when I need you, (BABY) 
Baby, (You're never there), 

On the phone, 
Long long distance, 
Always through such, 
Strong resistance, 

When first you say, 
You're too busy, 
I wonder if you, 
Even miss me, 

Never there, 
You're never there, 
You're never, ever, 
Ever ever there, 

A golden bird that flies away,  
A candle's fickle flame, 
To think I held you yesterday, 
Your love was just a game,

But when I need you, (BABY) 
Baby, 

Take the time, 
To get to know me, 
If you want me, 
Why can't you just show me, 

We're always on, 
This roller coaster, 
If you want me, 
Why can't you get closer, 

Never there, 
You're never there, 
You're never, ever, 
Ever ever there, 

Never there, 
You're never there, 
You're never, ever, 
Ever ever there"

Keep runnin through my mind

And days go by...
Each day I die a little more

A light shining through
You're barely waking

Yeah

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find
You and I collide

I'm quiet you know
You make a frist impression
I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind

When I was mowing the lawn.
I heard the lawn mower hit something,
and when I pulled it back I saw a shredded body of a baby rabbit.
I wanted to cry.
It was just there, 
and I killed it.
I toke an innocent life.
It was just a baby,
and now its dead.
I felt like I was a murderer.
It wasn't like hunting or fishing.
It was just a baby rabbit.
When I saw the body of the baby rabbit,
all torn up.
I wanted to cry.
Then after I thought about it for a few minutes...
...I did.
That was the first time I had cried in a while."

No haven now as I watch it pour from everywhere. 
Just like the storm that has come out of thin air. 
Gentle caresses, just as paper thin -frail 
and only- lack the strength to hold. 
What if could go to sleep for days, 
would you count the hours, 
or would your restlessness consume fading memories of me? 
Fall into open arms that offer their protection. 
Quick to deny that their open to deceit. 
Long to believe that support will never cease. 
Bitter and lonely, those they've left before.
What if could go to sleep for days, 
would you count the hours, 
or would your restlessness consume fading memories of me? 
The vibrant heart so quickly growing old, 
the warmest eyes so quickly growing cold. 
Just a glance for they don't care to see what becomes of me.
The vibrant heart so quickly growing old, 
the warmest eyes so quickly growing cold. 
Just a glance for they don't care to see what becomes of me
What becomes of me
What becomes of me

Seven Nation Army - The White Stripes

I'm gonna fight 'em all
A nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back

And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
And the message coming from my eyes
Says leave it alone

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell

And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that aint what you want to hear
But thats what I'll do
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says find a home

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera for evermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me go back home"

And she's taking the drag 

Now they're going to bed 
And my stomach is sick 
And it's all in my head 
But she's touching his chest now 

He takes off her dress now 
Let me go 
And I just can't look 
It's killing me 
And taking control 

Jealousy 
Turning saints into the sea 
Turning through sick lullaby 
Joking on your alibi 
But it's just the price I pay 
Destiny is calling me 
Open up my eager eyes

"event","I know... It's here we retreat, 
for where else could we go? 
To great disbelief there is somewhere we belong. 
In negative space supposed flaws go unseen, 
but our strength is shown. 
In darkness together we're bringing the light. 
In darkness together we are forming. 
The fire tomorrow is born of the night, 
in darkness together we ignite. 
From all we've been shunned but we found a new home. 
To great discontent it is greatness that we own. 
In luminous eyes, reflections of fear absolute... 
All hate what we've become. 
In darkness together we're bringing the light. 
In darkness together we are forming. 
The fire tomorrow is born of the night, 
in darkness together we ignite. 
Through our will we bring fear. 
Left to burn beneath the sun. 
We are one. 
When daylight forms blinding walls where do we go? 
Days arid are scorching all. 
When daylight forms blinding, binding walls where do we go? 
The darkness calls.


I stole this from Will's buddy profile, sorry Will, it seems to fit really well right now though, I hope you dont mind.

No one ever plans to sleep out in the gutter...sometimes that's just the most comfortable place."

If only you knew how this feels.

I would never want what we have to end.
But I can't stand this feeling, and i wish it would end.

The only time I dont feel this way is when we are together.  
Because when we are I feel great just to be with you.

My heart needs mending.
Damn it hurts.

"event","Well today sucked, thats all there is to it. 
I have been feelin down all day.
We lost our game 6 to 0.
We had to do hills after we lost.
When i was in the car my dad thought i cought an ""attitde"" and theatened to ""rip my head off"" if I didn't give him more respect.
My mom took Maddie and Charlie to chuck 'e cheeses.
The pizza was gross ad i felt sick after eating it.
I didn't want to go in the first place, but I didn't wanna stay  home with my dad and have him lecture me about respect.
So i just sat there at a bench in a living hell were all the little demons are really little kids.
It was like satan's playground. 
I am never going back there!
Today just plain out sucked!"

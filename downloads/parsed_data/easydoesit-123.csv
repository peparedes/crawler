"event","It's been a loong time since last posting, We originally joined to keep in touch with my daughter while she was in Japan. She is back now, got married and is very busy in college and work. Now we can start posting to stay Updated. Both our lives are very busy. A month after she (redinJapan, or red.) got married I (her Dad) was also married. Funny old thing life, at her wedding I signed their marriage license, then my new son in law signed mine at our wedding. red was writing about extended families in her last posting and it got me to remembering that, although its only been five months now."

"event","Hello to Gwen ,I know you're out there! well Kristin and i went the Deep Purple concert on july 27th! It was a great experience , we had a lot of fun. The band is in great shape and the energy between the crowd and the band is still a hallmark of seeing a Deep Purple show. That and the fact that we were only 8 rows back from stage in front of Roger Glover ( the bass player) really made it an unforgettable night. after 40 years in music to see them do a show like that was inspiring. That's all for now hope all is well in Japan! love Dad."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp; My daughter is in Japan wearing black yet frilly dresses?!&nbsp; did'nt see that one coming! Gwen you look like an Anime come to life. Very original of you, you looked great in it. As much as I was into my own comic books as&nbsp;a kid, they mostly wore tights and or a cape, kind of hard to pull that off&nbsp; in public.

"event","<p align=""left"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; memorial day today, going swimming. Did the glow sticks taped to the nunchaku last night but it was a little cold by 11p.m. so we watched part of a Frank Zappa dvd. Some of it was pretty dull, but I find it pretty cool the way he arranged and expiremented with music.&nbsp; mean while, somewhere in Japan, I hope all is well.</p>"

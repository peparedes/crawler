Analise is a 2 year old. what else do you want me to say about that? she had her first dentist appt today and she did well, no crying or whining. got 2 stickers and yet ANOTHER dora tooth brush. 

Hmm and i finally get to see a dermatologist on friday, shitty part is i have to pay for parking. good part is at least it's not November like they told me my appt would be.

Or heard lovely comments from my boyfriend who knows NOTHING about you? yeah if the roles were reversed you never would have gone to dinner. and i told you that i wasn't going to dinner. what part of "" i'll pass on dinner"" was confusing? ironic.... me nicely saying FUCK OFF isn't clear. i told stephen i was gonna pass on dinner and that i'd see you whenever but i think he didn't quite understand what was said . but whatever. mission accomplised.

My insurance agreed to pay for Analise's formula. I myself at the store pay $26  for a 1 pound can. They are sending me 12 1 pound cans ( supposedly a month, i have to call to reorder when i need it so i can take as long as i want ) at $58.50 a can. that's more than twice what i spend! But there is where the good news comes in. My insurance requires me to pay my $100 deductible and then they pay 80% and i pay 20%. So for 12 cans i pay $140 and change a month ( and a one time fee for my deductible ). granted that's not bad for 12 cans even for what i pay for them. 
12 x $26 = $312 is what i would pay for them
12 x $58.50 = $702 is what my home care place charges for them. thank god for the 80/20 split, and the $562 i don't have to pay myself.

As it looks it takes me around 5 days to go through a can of formula. for a 31 day month i will go through about 6 cans of formula. But that's with her eating 4 and a half ounces a feeding 5 or 6 times a day. yeah something like that. But the dr said once she makes it to 6 or 7 ounces a feeding and she still isn't satisfied then i can start spoon feeding her cereal. Which i understand but i also find odd because she has cereal in her bottle for her acid reflux. and i know giving her cereal by spoon is to teach her to eat by spoon but isn't that gonna be like 1 and a half times or 2 times as much cereal a day? doesn't that make for one fat baby?

oh and on that news she had her check up on the 22nd and she was 10 pounds 1 ounce, which is in the 45% range. and her height is 22 and a a half inches, which is in the 75% range. Now Normal ranges are 45 - 55 percent. she the doctors says she's tall and skinny. i died laughing and said "" nothing like your momma! "" i'm so fucked up, even to myself! i guess that's all for now"

She sleeps on brian's side of the bed. for some reason it seems she has never really been fond of her co-sleeper. don't get it, but whatever.

well at my last visit ( which was monday the 27th) my amniotic fluid was CRAZY low ( 6 out of 10.... the don't like you to go below 9 ) and my blood pressure was CRAZY high. 150s / 100s yeah so off to the hospital i went. i was only there for 24 hours, but i was more stressed out there then i was as home. while i was there i had my blood pressure taken about 20 times. and the baby heart monitored like 10 times, and she wasn't making it easy. 
tuesday i had an ultrasound done at the hospital, and i guess it was high enough that i was able to go home; with one condition though. COMPLETE BED REST, i only have bedroom privileges. Can't cook or clean ( fine with me) or do laundry or even make the bed. oh man am i LOSING my mind. not that i had much of one let to begin with. it pisses me off that i had to go into the hospital to begin with and then leave with out the baby.  I'm not gonna want to go back into the hospital again, god damn it. but whatever. what choice do i have? 
Well i'm off to bed ( at least lay in it) because i have another drs appt in the morning."

"event","did i mention i want this kid out? i went to the drs on thursday, yet another pointless visit. well that's how i feel about them any ways i go every week and have a visit and an ultrasound. Yeah the ultrasounds are cute to see and all but do i really need to come once a week for this? My fluid is still low, woohoo for me right? I am in so much freaking pain that i can't walk, and now i wake up yesterday morning and my boobs are killing me. what the fuck else can go wrong? Nothing on my body is normal any more, i have swelling every where ( especially in my face ) and if a part of my body isn't swollen then it hurts. 

Oh and the once a week visit thing, guess what. the dr is leaving the room saying how "" everything looks great and i'll see you next thursday"" just as the finishes the word thursday he STOPS right in his tracks. He turns around and comes back into the room and says, "" you know what, let me check a few other things before i go"" he does what he has to do and then says "" nevermind i wanna see you monday morning early"" i'm like monday afternoon? no, Monday before lunch. UGH, do i have to get up that early? apparently i do, but i'm gonna tell you right now i'm going in there with my hair on fire telling him he has to induce me soon i can't take 2 or 3 more weeks of this. Oh no brother it won't happen.

But before i leave his office i'm like "" is anything wrong?"" he says "" No i just want to see you monday morning"" i say "" ARE you SURE there is nothing wrong? ""  he says "" i am sure there is nothing wrong. i just want to see you on monday. Don't stress out about me wanting to see you on monday everything is looking perfect"" i say "" if it looks perfect why do you want to see me on monday? "" and with that he gives me a funny look and says "" heather i will see you on monday, nothing is wrong. just go home and relax. ""
Now this makes me think i'm gonna go into labor soon, and if that's the case WHY CAN'T HE JUST TELL ME THAT! yeah well that's pretty much it. good bye"

"event","where do i start? ok well my shower went ok, actually pretty good. Only one couple didn't show up and he had good reason. i'll get him later. Jackie showed up late, so did shavon. and i could not believe who she showed up with! my ex, chris. but actually it was cool, after 5 minutes of awkwardness i got over it, and it was actually nice to see him. and see that he's not the stuck up ass he used to be. and he looked good, so all in all about that i'm happy. where him and i are concerned the past is the past, with him i have a HARD time doing that, but i love him and i'm more than past him. it was just great to see him and see that he's making a real life and not just existing like he used to. OK enough about that

Little miss avery ( my 5 year old helper) helped me open gifts. i opened the cards and she opened the gifts, which was fine with me. It meant no bending over, which i can't do well anyways.

Jim was an ass like always, i'm an SERIOUS starting to second guess anything that has to do with him, oh man i can't and don't want to get INTO THAT.

Jackie stayed late because she arrived late, it was nice. i miss seeing her every day.

Kelly, lol. i love you! and i need to see you more!

Brian's family, ODD as always but whatever.

Let's see THIS shower ( mind you i had two) i got: 
- TONS OF CLOTHES ( duh)
- my high chair
- my travel system
- my pack and play
- my bouncer ( vibration seat)
- gate
- bath stuff
- a hand made kids chair, which is CUTE as all hell!
- oh and my crib bedding.

My Previous shower i got:
- my car seat ( the older one, for past 20 pounds)
- my swing
- tons of clothes and bath stuff.
- lots of little things
- my diaper champ
- feeding stuff

i feel like i got more out of my mom's shower for me ( the previous one), i can't explain why that's just how i feel.

oh man i'm so ready for this baby to come out. and let me tell you once i came home i passed out and now that i'm awake i feel like crap and i just feel off. UGH"

"event","see i gained NOTHING last week and this week? i gained 3 freaking pounds. bastards. baby is fine, she's doing well. i had an ultrasound today she's 4 pounds and 10 ounces, i got the cutest face pictures. can't decide who's nose she has. either way she's screwed. my pre eclamsia has gotten worse, i now have swelling in my legs and face. how lovely! and i'm showing all the sign that labor is coming soon. General un-comfortableness ( if that's a word ), pressure, pressure and more pressure. my blood pressure is higher than before ( i don't even want to know ), amniotic fluid is getting too low. it's on the LOWER gray scale, i lose much more and out the baby comes. But the doctors wants me to hold out for as long as i can. he said if i really wanted him to that he would tell me what my options are ( meaning induce labor) but he would prefer to wait at least a little longer."

"event","i gained nothing this week, thank god! but that's where the good news ends. My blood pressure is sky high, and my baby thinks that waiting till i'm dead asleep to reposition her whole body is fun. Sleep? what's that? turning over? none existent, i have to sit up and turn and then lay back down. 
Oh and the pressure! no one tell you about the weird and painful pressure you have in your lower body.
Being that i'm 33 weeks i am still suppost to be seeing the doctor every two weeks, but since i'm broken in like 8 different ways i get to see him weekly.
Next week? A check up and an ultrasound
Oh i do have more good news, my income tax ( federal at least) came back, but that's as good as spent... on bills and getting my car fixed tomorrow. oh the pleasures of being poor"

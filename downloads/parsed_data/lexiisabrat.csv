I have really liked the show to begin with, but HOLY SHIT. I don't want to give the whole story but if you saw it you know what I am talking about!!! RIGHT ON to the writers!!! You guys KICK ass. Other than that... feeling kindy icky today... like the ""I know I am going to get sick feeling"" BLEH!! Good thing I can kinda sleep in tomorrow, I don't have to be at work til 12 (YIPPEE!)

"event","I have been meaning to update lately... too many things to rant and rave about.... here's a quickie list...

1. THE FREAKING IDIOT PRESIDENT!! I know I am normally not all political, but I really don't want to live in a country that tells people who can get married and what exactly a marriage is... IT really bothers me that he thinks gay marriage is wrong!! WHAT IS SO WRONG WITH IT?? please someone explain to me how 2 people loving each other is wrong.... how they are not entitled to the same benefits. It's been proven that there are less divorces (breakups) whatever of gay marriages families.... and in his speech today talking about the sanctity of the family... UMMM HELLO idiot... that is a family! ARRRGH. I HATE him. before I was just mildly annoyed, but now... WHOOO. I have a lot more to say about this topic but I don't want to type it all out... ask if you really want to know my opinion. 

2. People talking about Israel and the issues there when they have NO clue. Please don't tell me that there are bombings everyday, it's not safe wherever you go, people there are crazy... cause all you will get from me is IGNORED. I feel that Israel is more my ""homeland"" than America.

ok... since it just erased everything else I just wrote I am done for the evening."

I was supposed to start working this week, BUTTTT they didn't get the drug test back until Tuesday, and they hired someone else to start with me, but they want to train us together so they don't have to do it twice... so now I have to wait until this other person can work out their schedule... HOW annoying. They are supposed to call me on Monday and gimme the details. My mom and her friends are coming up here tomorrow (awww how romantic, spending crappy ass valentines day with my momma) She offered to buy me new jeans if I play tour guide for her friends... HELLS YEAH! I think we are also going out to lunch with my sister. Who knows. It seems like everytime my mom comes up here it's either raining or snowing... HOPEFULLY the weather will be good. Anyway, I am off to another freaking class. Last one of the day... but have LOTS of studying and stuff to do this weekend. Laundry too, that's cause Jay won't come and do it for me!! MEANIE."

I haven't heard from my friend Dennis in about a month and it leads me to believe that I am not really worth the time to write, cause well, what else do you have time to do while you are in jail? oh well. Focusing more on school now. Some of my classes are kicking my ass at the moment. Can't wait to start working sometime this week... as soon as they get the results from my drug test back. No worries here. Wish I knew more people in Madison... I should start hanging out at the bars or something... maybe then I wouldn't be so damn lonely. arrgh.

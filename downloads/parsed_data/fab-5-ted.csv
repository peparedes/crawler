You're probably in front of the mirror right now checking for gray hairs, aren't you?! :)

So, any plans for your BIG DAY?"

I really have no excuse for my absence besides extreme over-workingness, but I do apologize for the lack of posting.

I've taken today off to just do nothing. Nothing at all.  Well, besides this that is. *smiles*

I heard from Barry.  He sounds happy, which is great.  Of course there is nothing more that I could wish for him, and I guess when you get right down to it, I'm happy too.  

So, how are my fab four? Anyone want to come watch the premier of QAF at my place this weekend? Call me and let me know.  Thom, call me anyway. :)"

I know that he needs to be with his mother during her illness and I respect that. <i>ETA:  Barry's mother had a relapse earlier this week.  She is in the hospital getting a multitude of tests and investigations done. </i> But it doesn't change the fact that I've lost the man I love twice in one year..."

Barry and I were back in Chicago for a couple weeks because his mom was ill, but she has recovered now and all is well.  I did have a LOT of work to do when we returned though and sadly this journal was neglected.

The show is going fabulously as always... hugs to all my boys Kyan, Carson, Jai, and of course Thom!

P.S. Martha's guilty??? There IS justice in this world!!"

Had the greatest weekend ever.  Barry and I went away to a nice little bed and breakfast for the past 2 days and it was wonderful!  It was like being on our honeymoon again! 

Now back to work, there's so much to do to get ready for our big Second Season kick-off next Saturday... not to mention it's Valentine's Day, so... plans are all in the works.

Well, that's all for now!

Cheers, queers!!"

I had a fantabulous afternoon with Thom the other day... definitely needs to happen more often.

I see my other half has decided to jump on this bandwagon and get an lj... now is this really an attempt to catch up with me, or just another outlet to send me on a guilt trip? (probably both).  I know what you're all thinking --Ted, you bitch!-- all he has to do is come home to find out how I am.

*sigh* So, how are my other fab fives?? Big hello to Jai and Kyan! Enjoy the time away!  And Carson what's new on the fashion front? 

That's all for now... still searching for the perfect tagline, although I got some great ideas already."

"event","First things first, I gotta thank Thom for gettin' my butt in gear!  Not only in everyday life, but in regards to keeping my journal up-to-date as well. Sorry I haven't been around lately... CRISIS... nothing you're not familiar with I'm sure (*why* were you in the hospital??)

Alright, on to the issues.  

I caught a rerun of Martha Stewart Living recently and I have to agree:  this woman needs to be locked up!  She dared to serve a shiraz wine with mahi-mahi. *gasp* She <i>is</i> a criminal!

I am of course skirting the *actual* issue here...

*sigh* Barry's staying at a hotel for the time being.  His argument is that since QE started, I have been ""unavailable"".  I'm not really sure exactly how his moving out is supposed to help this situation, but we're doing our best to work through it.  

Anyway, I've got to finish my article for Esquire, so I best be on my way.

**I never know quite how to end these entries... I think I need a cool tag line.  Any ideas?"

"event","Nothing much different has happened.. however we are now about 20 hours and 22 minutes into this thang! As you already know Soldiers Santiano and Roy are now Resting in Peace.  And over the night many things happened. Such as goin for a walk and seeing a cab driver drive by us about 3 or 4 times as well as Meaghans brother.  So we went into Walgreens and Meaghans bro came over to us and was like I saw the Cab driver and i drove back n forth to check on you guys.  So he gave us a ride back to my house.  Mary still not feeling well had to go home. So Brittney n Naha walked her home and then went to Dunks to get us Energy.  They went for a few walks while Courtney, Kristin, and I had some chats and just chilled.  Around 4 we began playing video games which suprisingly kept us ammused until about 5:30 ish.  Then we had breakfast and Courtney became extremly over-tired and thinks that she will make it.  I doubt she makes it more then 2 hours.  In fact I bet shes sleeping right now.  (no offense)  So anyways everybody went home to shower cuz we are goin early bird shoppin at Filenes cuz they got maDd sales goin on.  Also we MIGHT lose Kristin cuz shes got one busy day ahead of her :`(  . 
 So until later.. ((Brianna))"

"event","Only 4 hours and 51 minutes left until we complete 24 hours. With day 1 almost completed, we lost one of our soldiers due to upset stomach. Mary contacted us and told us that she threw up 4 times! Well Court and Kristin are a little tired, but me, Britt, and Naha are still strong and are pretty confident. Oh and we also found out some interesting news at around 3:15ish. Ryan Olejarz, Oak, decided to enter the competition and is aiming for 82 hours rather than 72. We aren't really worrying about it that much, but we will keep in touch to make sure that he doesn't beat our time. Until next time...

Couldn't help but walk in
It's the last place I should be
But I'm dying to see you

Have I held out for something?
That is never gonna happen

It's not me that you love

You woke up cold this morning
Shield away from my touch
I would never mean to hurt you
'Cause I love you so much

Was it always only one night
That you ever wanted from me

School / Went to Prince with most of the softball team...
Me n Tara met a lil girl named Jenna and we taught her how to do the whole Peace out - A Town thing it was pretty funny.  But yea we jus hung out there for a while and these weird kids kept comin up to us asking if we knew wat the weather was and they looked like they were like 15 but said they were 18 and one smoked and he was all weird and skeevy (sp?). So then after that me courtney and tara went back to courtneys house and hung out and got hyper.  Then some kids picked us up and we all went to play some wiffle ball but it didnt last long and they brought us back to Ali's house.  It was wicked fun, she taught us some cool stuff and we danced and snuck stuff in a Capri Sun Box.  It was pretty cool.  Then i slept ova there thats about it.

[Saturday]
Got ready after comin home from Ali's then went to the Varsity softball game with Courntey Tara and Naha.  It was a pretty good game.. esspecially in the end.  They won in the bottom of the seventh 1-0.  and a special someone was at the game what a loser. So Britts mom came and got us all and we ran some errands then headed back to her house and hung out then we went to taras and hung out w/ Britt, mare, Court, naha, Kristin, tara, Brad, Matty, Timmy, Meaghan, and Ryan i think that was it... and we played some truth or dare and popcorn and stuff.  It was a fun night.

[Sunday]
BBQ ova brittneys aunts house w/ britt mare n court.  Played wiffle ball with her cousins and brother.  Ate and hung out fun stuff! Then we went ova Marys house and looked at the new year book.  And courtney met back up with us with her really cool pink drawstring bag that i got her last year lol.  And we went ova courtneys and got wicked hyper and did some dirrty dancing.  Then Courtney was like u guys should sleep ova but only me and brittney could so we did.  So we danced in our booty shorts and uhh some shirts..lol so we did that for a while then we chilled and talked about a bunch of different stuff.  Where da hood where da hood where da hood at.  Where da hood where da hood where da hood at.  Where da hood where da hood where da hood at... etc. lol and there were some inanimate objects on the toilet all night lol.. ""wow we all look pretty tan right now"".. ""i look green"" ahaha lmao.  But anyways of course Courtney dosed off and me and brittney were still talkin and like always she was talkin in her sleep thinkin she could join in the conversation then dosed right off again.  So we went to sleep and i woke up in the morning to Courtneys head like sleepin on my shoulder and she was like right next to me and i was like hmmmmm ok? while brittney had half of the bed to sleep on.  but i finally slept ova courtneys house after 6 1/2 years! 

[monday]
Me and mary tried with the whole job thing again and it jus didnt work out... She ate ova and we took a wicked long walk for about an hour and we saw Liz who was goin on a cute lil date lol. and pat beeped and waved very happily at us.. it was wicked funny

"event","Durin the day i was pretty bored.. i made a movie about my friends n did chores.

Then later on Me, Courtney, Mary, J-Rizzle, and Tara went to see mean girls!! it was sooo funny!! tara almost got us killed cuz she almost went into a lane with on-coming traffic haha lol.. hmm we were watchin the movie and all of a sudden the dumb movie people decide to turn on the lights! n everyone was screamin lights!!! so then these 2 fat like 11 year olds stampeed down the stairs to go tell them.. so we got back to the movie n it was definatly one of the best movies i have ever seen. it was wicked funny!  acctually it was wicked fetch haha.  So anyways umm there was this kid that looked wicked familior in it and i figured out later that he was on ""are you afraid of the dark"" so that was kinda cool cuz he got hott.  After the movie we stayed in the theater till everyone left n dance while the credits went up n tara was still dancin when the usher came in. so we jus kinda sat n chilled n we did some prank phone calls that was fun.  i got some chicken fingers that were supposed to come to a total of 8.50 cuz i got a small drink too n the guy was like uhh jus give me 3.51 i was like uhh oK!! so that really topped off the night lol.  so we waited for courtneys mom to come n there were some ghetto kids outside n one called mary over n we ran away n i wasnt lookin in front of me as i ran and i ran head on to some random kid.. woops.  so we stood there n for some odd reason mary was like pushing tara n she fell in front of all the ghetto kids n they jus turned n looked at her n were like ""ohhhhhhh"" it was pretty funny.  n thats pretty much it.. funn night!!

"event","So. I walked into the room for the fiftieth time and she lifted her head up. She looked so beautiful. I layed down with her and she's like, ""So, can I kiss you, or do I have to wait another week, 'cause we went too fast."" I was like, go ahead. Then she says, ""Little Peanut is the only one here?"" I was like, yeah. Mom's at work. She says, ""oh. I just wanted to know if she'd barge in on us."" I was like, yeah. That's why I have a lock on my door. And she groaned, saying It's too far away. I got up. Got Jessie's movie started and locked the door. We sat there for five minutes, and I was like, I got Jessie ready, locked the door and covered the window. You gonna do something? And she sat up and kissed me. God. She's so amazing. Things went fast and slow. Sometimes, she'd just look at me. Smile. And kiss me softly.

She gave me seven hickies. My boobs are more colorful than a gay pride parade.

Offhandedly, I said, ""People at school are gonna be mad/ upset/ jealous."" 

She looked at me, said, ""Doesn't matter."" And kissed me.

           We kiss a lot. She has soft lips. And her tongue sneaks everywhere.

                                           She's reassured me that our relationship won't be just sexing it up.

                                    Peanut."

"event","Okay, she was beating around the bush of asking me something. They she says, close your eyes. So I do and she says sit up. I do and she grabs my hands. I was like, Oh shit. She wants to kiss me. Nerves of steel? Ha.

She still hadn't asked me, so she got a pen and wrote, ""I want to kiss you. Can I?"" On my arm and then she like, dove to the bed and called herself a chicken shit.

I walked out of the room to clear my head. Walked back in and pressed myself against the door. She walked up and said, ""Maybe I'll just do it."" And kissed me. Twice...

We layed down and I pulled her to me, asking her if I can ask her out. She said yes. I said ""Will you go out with me?"" She said yes. Booyah. I was laying down and she was sitting over me, playing with my neck. (With her fingers.) And she leaned down and kissed me, a lot. She likes to blow around my neck, ear area and make me squirm under her hands, that, were pinning me to the bed. Then after I got pretty worked up I pushed her back on the bed and tried to get my nerves to do something. After a long ass time, I kissed her neck. Then spent five hours between kissing very lightly and tongueing the fuck out of her.

At one point she had my pinned against the wall, her chest out towards me so I touch her... yeah. And she was grinding herself against my chest. I thought I was about to pass out. She was above me and touching me and her hair was everywhere. After a while, I let her breathing get back to normal and grazed my teeth along her nipple, through the shirt and bra.

She moaned and said, ""That didn't last long."" 

She had me so worked up and I couldn't do anything about it. I just had to lay there and accept that I got really turned on with nowhere to go.

She tastes really good. It's ten the next morning and I still have her on my lips. She gave me a hickey.

Do I think we went to fast, yes. Did I like it, yes. Will it happen again soon, not that much.

Am I going to kiss the fuck out of her before she leaves, I think so."

"event","Okay. So, my Aunt Pat lives in Florida, right? And I havent seen her for five years, right? So my grandmother sends monies down there for her, her fiance Richard, Carolyn, and Carolyn's husband Jonathan to come up to Michigan. So, last night, me, mom, and jessie go over to my grandmother's to wait for them. But they dont come until one am and we left at like, eight. So today, after school, we went over there. We talked and talked and then we decided to go to Elkhart, Indiana. Where my uncle Floyd lives. I hadnt went to the bathroom since six this morning. It was six when we left. I had to go to the bathroom soooooo bad, I started crying cause it hurt. We stopped at a gas station maybe, two seconds from my uncle's. When I came out, my aunt was slamming the side of her van and yelling at me to hurry up. Julie decided to tell them that I had peed forever, and that she thought the faucet was on. Jennifer, her two sons, Billy, my uncle, and my aunt were there. My uncle made pizza.  We all shared stories. Then we decided it was time to leave. an hour there and back. and it was eight there. So, we get going and my mom didnt turn where she was supposed to. So she pulls over and decides to turn around. Julie told her there was a car behind Carolyn and moms like, ""No that is Carolyn."" And the other car almost hit us, then Carolyn turned and was about an inch away from her. We got back to my grandmother's house and said goodbye. then took Carolyn and Jonathan to Carolyn's grandmother's house. then we came back here. Tomorrow we have to take adam over there."

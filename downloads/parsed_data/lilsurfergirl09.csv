"event","so today on the way home from school we saw this man and woman and the woman had two fingers witha cigarette between them and a dog on a leash and the man was carrying a parrot.  yes they were walking outside it was realllllly weird i never knew that people took parrots for walks. i didnt get to go to the lockup thing so i was kinda mad about taht cuz i wanted to see what it was all about. i heard it was funny and i heard it wasnt a big deal. o well.  tonight im going to soccer/track practice.  yes more conditioning.  it will be good for us in the long run and its only till 7 40 today so that will be good. im so tired i cant wait to sleep. my family is going out to dinner so that willbe good i guess.  i have to finish packing tonight even though we arent leaving till sat. im excited to get out of this weather and michigan its so ugly.  today in history me and andrea played the most intense game of dots ever! shes a cheater but i still won haha. it was fun im sure u all wanted to know that."

"event","So I started this journal thing. I was really bored and I dk I think it would be kinda fun to have one, but my life is probably boring to all you guys but w/e I dc.  So today was Monday.  another boring day and ikenhower (yes lauren i got that from ur crazy friend mark). lol but anyway I'm going on my cruise in 5 days and im so excited. I'm glad to get out of this good ol' michigan weather we have.  Tonight I have soccer from 640 to 840. we are conditioning the whole time... should be fun.  we had scrimmages on saturday and we did really good i think.  we beat avondale 3 0 then we beat NPD 2 0 then we tied Troy 0 0. It was a lot of fun and all the girls are really cool and funny. I'm so excited for the season to start.  We have a lot of talent and I think we can go far if we work hard and make it count.  So there is alot of drama in the friend category right now.  It's really stupid I think but lucky me gets to sit back and watch all of it happen so its kind of interesting.  I dk y ppl worry so much about what other ppl think of them.  Just be yourself and if you cant then your insecure.  ill stop there. i have a math test tm... yesss.  no its gonna suck but its better to get it over with i guess. i hate how teachers cram everything in the last week of break."

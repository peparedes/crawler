aight, see you in two months

hopefully i will figure out how to delete this thing

"event","holly shit, i though i never would go back on livejournal but its 4:35am and i have nothing else to do. so here goes the last 2 months of my life... LS was amazing, ive been been in the studio probably longer then i have slept this entire session.  im getting better with my money (but not really), and digressed in bowling.  I spent the last two days organizing my itunes (album art, putting songs in the right order, etc.) and thats probably the most progressive thing ive done all session. fuck this, i hate LJ.

i hate hippies


so i  guess a lot of people think that i am an asshole. isnt that radd or what?  i would probably sound like a bigger asshole if i said that i could care less so i just wont say anything about that.  what else new.  so i have like 1 friend from my h.s. group.  i guess that i pissed everyone else off.  sry if i like to speak my mind.  what else.  oh yea, i tried out for the real world and im pretty sure im going to get on that show so i might now see you guys for a few months, and when i come back i probably wont talk to you cause i will be too hugh of a celebrity. i hate hippies. is it weird that i like to be alone doing nothing sometimes then hanging out with people?  and even though i say i really want a roommate, in the back of my head, i kinda dread it.  it would be cool and all but i would probably get tired of it pretty quick.  i still love you though.  the more and more i go to school i realize may new things.  that there are a lot of fucking idiots at are school who are not going to do anything with their lives.  photography doesnt really pay that well as i though it would. and what else.  that pretty much about it i think.  is it also weird that i really dont care that much about being in a relationship.  they are kinda annoying.  but if it happens it happens.   what other pointless shit can i write about.  all the good bands are breaking up; ex: comeback kid and champion.  now there are 3 or 4 decent bands out right now.  have you ever felt like a girl liked you but you really dont like them but you still go along with it just to make them feel better.  thats pretty shitty i guess.  im such a fucking pushover.  

in conclusion, im sry to everyone i have pissed off, its all GOOD CLEAN FUN

late, 

love,

yours truly,

palmer

You are more intuitive than observant, you are more feeling based than thinking based, and you prefer to go with the flow rather than having a plan.  Your type can best be summarized by the word ""Healer"", which belongs to the larger group of idealists.  You have a capacity for caring that is deeper than most.  You strive for unity, are fascinated by the battles between good and evil, and can be something of an idealist.  Only 1% of the population shares your type.<BR>
As a romantic partner, you are usually supprtive and nuturing, however, you have a high need for individuality.  Harmony is extremely important to you as you are very affected by conflict and tension, which also makes you resist confronting your partner directly about problems.  When you get angry, you usually blame yourself, rather than your partner.  You can also be stubborn and unyielding when you feel you are being criticized or mistreated.  You feel the most appreciated when your partner listens to you carefully.  You need to be understood.  You need to hear your partner express their feelings, the more often, the better.

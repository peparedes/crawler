"event","Feels like you've been trying to play all these games 
With you, I felt sorrow and pain 
Now my love has sailed away 
There's no turning back the skies are grey 

Autum ashes turn to dust 
Streets grow silent with pouring rain 
There's a time for everything 
There's a place for every broken soul 

Dont you waste my time again 
Everything we were, we are no more 
Everybody hurts 
I didn't say love lasts forever 
Everybody bleeds 
I didn't say I liked it that way 

I can still remember all the things you said 
Told me, that we'll be forever 
Standing still hoping for change 
Through time things will heal then often fades 

Nothing to say to you without feeling betrayal in your eyes 
Now that I leave you run to me that's just the way love goes 
Nothing to say to you without feeling betrayal in your eyes 
Now that I leave you run to me that's just the way love goes"

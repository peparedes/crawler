I skimmed the tops of cherry trees,
over and under and inbetween.
I circled the block on a summer breeze
and tried to recall the Seven Seas,
over and under and inbetween.
But their water rose up to the sun
spilling and running over every one!
Without much ado,
I went and grabbed my trusty spoon.
One spoon, two spoon, three spoon, FOUR.
Five spoon, six spoon, and a hundred more!
Soon the earth did reappear
and everyone thought they were in the clear.
But the earth had taken on a new shape,
after the horrifying water rape.
Cuts and bruises lined the beaches
draining its blood like millions of leeches.
But oh what a sight to behold,
before everything turned ice cold."

And as tragic as that is, I believe I ended it in the best possible way:
with some sourpatch kids, cucumbers, and a champagne bottle.
Makes sense.

Also, today I moved into a dorm. The whole concept of dorm life is strange.
I feel like Im at camp. I dont like bunk beds much, but I do like my roommate so 
I think Ill survive.

Come visit me at my new abode. All six of you. Do it.

"event","So I've decided that hitchhiking home at 5am is always a good idea.
You will either be picked up by a) a serial killer rapist or b) a hippie stoner guy.
I got choice b). It was Easter morning so I think I lucked out because of Jesus or maybe
all the serial killers are off for the holidays. Anyway, now we're friends.
I didn't get to sleep either because it was Easter and you have to wake up early to partake
in all the festivities. Sleep is a rare commodity these days. 
Awake is the new Sleep. Chins are the new Nose. Drunk is the new Sober and Straight is the new Gay.
I love it.
But really though, I hate sleep. I never have any interesting dreams. Kind of like the dead in Ring Two.
We never dream, therefore I must be dead right? Guess so. 
Who will save our souls? Hmm who? I like Jewel. She was my favorite back in the day. 
I even named my dog Jewel, but this was 6th grade okay! Now I tell people my dog's name is Jules
to sound like Pulp Fiction or something ubercool like that. But really no, it's Jewel.
I named her that in 6th grade because 6th graders do crazy, weird stuff like that.
I miss 6th grade. It was a good year for me.
I played saxophone.
I bet Jewel would be flattered to know that some crazy, weird 6th grader named her highly nervous, slightly stupid dog after her. I think Jewel appreciates crazy, weird stuff like that.
She used to live in a van and I bet she even picked up a few hitchhikers in her day.
I bet, I bet."

Because it makes me think, when will I ever see that man with the awesome moustache again? Probably never. 
Also, if it would have stayed open me and my mama wouldn't have had to drive all the way to Camelview to see Sideways. I'm glad we did though. On our way we passed My Big Fat Greek Restaurant and I thought that was funny. It was a good movie. It was crowded and I'm pretty sure I was the youngest person in attendance. That's okay.

It was nice out tonight.




I love Arizona Novembers.

Where ever your travels may take you, lets make a pact right now that November will be our month. Lets promise that where ever we may be we'll come back here in November. All the Novembers to come will be ours. Just ours. Promise me that, okay? Just think, this time next year we'll find each other again and no matter how much distance has grown between us we will know that by November we will have found each other again and we can never truly be lost."

Anyway, that means $5500 a year renewable each year. $22000! Yay for me. I think. My mom was definitely a thousand times more excited than I was. I said to her what if I didn't even want to go to ASU and she literally crumpled to the ground saying ""Don't do this to me!"" She has a flare for the dramatic.I didn't really want to stay here. I wanted to go somewhere new. But alas, I now have 22000 more reasons to stay. I'm kidding right? Oh of course I am. This is great news.

I think he's a pretty smart guy and it's interesting to hear his perspectives and have him explain the paradox that is our government. I don't usually like talking about politics and such, especially with people at school, mainly because that's all it is: just people talking in order to hear their own voice and no one is really listening. And I'm not one to parade my opinion in an audacious fashion, thinking that it's actually persuading people. So anyway, we talked about everything from Ross Perot to the electoral college to the Drudge Report to Prop. 400 to Reaganomics directly putting bee-keepers out of business.

I haven't. Yes, I do happen to believe that love is mainly about pushing chocolate covered candies and, you know, in some cultures, a chicken. You can call me a sucker, I don't care, because I do believe in it. Bottom line: couples who are truly right for each other wade through the same crap as everybody else, but the big difference is they don't let it take them down.

It was during a pool party and we had just finished telling everyone that they needed to evacuate the pool because there was lightning and whatnot. About thirty seconds later it starts pouring. Nice. Everyone gathers into our little guard room. About 50 people and the majority was under the age of twelve. Us awesome lifeguards run out in the rain/lightning/thunder/madness and save all their food and bring it inside. And you thought we just saved people. Then we all gather under a small overhang outside our guard room and watch as the lightning begins to surround us. CRACK! Ohh look there goes one of our lights. CRACK! Oh look it just struck our baby pool. Awesome. Except for I screamed everytime and grabbed onto the person nearest me. Then it was over. The people finally left. We cleaned a little. Realized it was pointless. Found some dead baby birds that got blown out of their nest. I cried. We played on the diving boards. And our pool is trashed. The end.

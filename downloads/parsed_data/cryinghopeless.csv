Shes gonna get her ass kicked and Im waiting for the perfect time to explode. At this time I would like to thanks everyone for being there for me when I was all depressed. Thanks Zina, Mindy, Ivy, Heather, and Melissa. You guy's are great. In fact I probably wouldnt be here if it werent for you guy's.<3 <3 <3 <3 Hearts for all of you!@~~}~~ roses even! Sorry I can't say the same about you guy's attempts to stop me from smoking. Thanks for trying tho guys!! *mwuah* I wish I could fly on clouds. What do you think clouds feel like? Maybe they're WHIPPED CREAM!!! Or maybe they're just big balls of water condensed into the atmosphere falling into place in the water cycle... Whatever. Theres an evil monkey that lives in my closet...but..he wasn't always evil... I should post some gay porn in here. That would be tight. Mmm... Well I've worn out my welcome. Don't forget to comment homies!"

We walked all that way and Mindy and I wouldnt stop bitching about the heat. I think Zina was getting annoyed...but shh!! dont tell her. We met up with Tyler, Christian, Alan, and Mario, and went to circuit city. When the day was over I was really happy for once. Anything is better than being depressed."

"event","I met this guy Jay online. He is pretty ""ok"" he gets on my nerves. He brags about everything. I hate when people brag. It makes them sound concieted and I hate concieted people. He wanted to hook up with me but I told him,""long distance relationships dont work out."" He really wants to be with me and he even said he would try to visit me when he turns 18. I know it wont happen, and I would rather not get my hopes up. Liz broke up with Theresa again. Theresa was being a bitch when she did. I couldnt believe how mad she was and she even had the nerve to tell Liz that she didnt want to be friends anymore. I told Liz that she bases everything on words alone, and shouldnt because words mean nothing when they arent supported by actions. I am coming to believe that ""love"" is overrated, but there is still a part of me that wants a commitment. I am sick of admitting it. I hate when people tell me bullshit just so I stop being depressed. If your gonna say something to me make sure you meant it. I hate life. I love you tho Liz."

He was acting all paranoid. I told him everything that he might have wanted to hear. He said, ""we have been best friends for years and I wouldnt stop being your friend now."" Those werent the words I had expeted. Then I started spazzing. He's still getting used to it, but he accepts it. He said, ""I cant believe how much you have changed."" Im glad were still friends. Moral of the story: Best friends are there no matter what."

Taking whats left of my black heart with its wraith touch.
The path is narrow; very thin
Paved with rotting sin.
A few cuts, blood as a pool.
In the end, I am the fool.
Secluded in my closet, Nowhere to go.
Cold as Night, I feel my blood flow.
Haunted by your presence I cry.
I am left wandering. Why is it so easy just to die?"

I thought that if I stopped calling him that he wouldnt call me. He never calls me! Now he just calls me out of nowhere. What the fuck is up with this!? We all know I cant have him, SO WHY THE FUCK IS HE CALLING ME!?!?!?! I understand that maybe he just wants to be friends but it doesnt make any fucking sense. We dont go to the same school, he lives 7 miles away, and I have no reason to go to the lower valley, except to see Liz. I cant take this!"

Asking someone to stop useing drugs is an act of love, and once again Theresa said ""No."" I hate for Liz to be let down like that. My uncle's are here from Kansas city. Now that everyone know's that Im ""not straight"" at Marrisa's. They offered me a shot of tequila yesterday and I turned it down. I might look like a pussy but it tastes like shit anyway. Besides Im Not trying to impress anyone. I dont know why but im not comfortable with my sexuality. I can tell my sister is trying to get it out of me. I hate dwelling in the past, just when I thought it was over, there was just much more to come. Im just gonna stop caring. Starting...NOW! Oh well. Some chick posted something on her journal. It really struck me when it said ""marriage not about gender, its about love."" Jon is lying to me about so much that it is becoming annoying. I never thought he would get annoying. Well there are other's out there. Jon is just out of my league for now."

All I can do is wish that he is telling me the truth. Liz is bringing me down from my good mood. Sometimes our bond can be mutualy beneficial, in this case its not. I abhor feeling depressed.

above is a website that calculates the amount of acres you personally use per year.  I think everyone should take a look at it because it really puts how the little things add up and how that realates to our dwindling natural resources.  It gives good ideas on how to help as well, so its a good website!


Mine was 9 acres by the by lower than the avg 24 but i still need 2.1 planets! ouch!"

never miss a chance to keep your mouth shut.  people will like you more ;) so i am going to keep in mind ""less is more"" my new motto if i can help it."

Once you are tagged you MUST write a blog about your 6 weird habits/things as well as state this rule clearly. In the end, you need to choose the next six people to be tagged and list their names.
ok ok ok lemme think...

1. i am terrified of closing umbrellas, so much in fact that I never use them and get soaked everytime it rains.
2. i absolutely despise the feel of velvet... it makes me sick to my stomach.
3. can't stand the squeak of stirofoam, snow, or sand
4. i composively die my hair whenever I am upset depressed etc..
5. i sing myself to sleep sometimes 
6. i am crazily non competitive and get really upset and worked up whith competitive people. It is hard to decribe. I go out of my way to avoid competitive situations and I am really anxious and gaurded around competitive people.  I guess it is my pet peeve when people constantly try to out due everyone else in trivial things.ahk! i am getting angry just thinking about it!

so i guess thats it off the top of my head nothing really cool i bet people that know me well could think of better ones. lets see i will tag... Jenny, Chris(Chris), Moogs, Erin, and Manda...
sorry if you guys were ALREADY tagged it just means now you are doublly tagged :)"

"event","has something changed?
i am trying to decide
have i been channel surfing
in my sleep again
so
i think i caught a hold
of something important 
so i will grit my teeth
and bare it
and wait for my lady sleep
to take me down... 
i will sleep and i will pray
that when i wake
as the first light of dawn
hits the kitchen floor 
where i lay 
that i still have that 
which is mine
and it hurts 
but it is solid 
and it is the only thing
i need 
to stand on fresh morning legs
today is new~"

""It was a chemical lie, and it killed with time, but life killed in time, didn't it? And if dying was all there was didn't it make sence to go to it happy rather than fester in a dirty hole of a world where the void whisperd at every corner? So when pearl came upstarirs with her heroin she took it, thanked her politely, and went to the island, dancing"""

"event","come home and my guitar
has nothin to say to me
i recoil from all my friends
and then i'm in misery
been so long since i've been held
really since i was his
probably just need to be held
that's probably all it is

course, then i think of my dad
who time travels mostly now
back to when he was free
and holding out hope somehow
who sits all day in a line
of wheelchairs against a wall
inventing ways to play out time
like us all
like us all

to all the people out there tonight
who are comforting themselves
if you should happen to see my light
you can stop and ring my bell
i'm just sittin here in this sty
strewn with half written songs
taking one breath at a time
nothin much going on
nothin much going on

little flashing zero
on my answering machine
rats scratching at my brain
brain shuffling its feet
yes i have my father's heart
it may or may not keep on trying
can't really tell you what it is
keeps me this side of that dark line

but i'm not there to take care of him
and i'm not here to take care of me
i'm going outside to watch the house burn down
across the street
i'm going outside to watch the house burn down
across the street


one of the few songs right now that really speak to me... good stuff its my anthum
i hope to see everyone tomorow it will nice to have a gathering :)"

""So why did I kiss him so hard late last friday night 
And keep on letting him change all my plans 
I'm either so sick in the head 
I need to be bled dry to quit 
Or I just really used to love him 
I sure hope that's it 

I knew that to keep in touch would do me deep in dutch 
'Cause it isn't the rush of remembering, it's just mush 
And that signature thing is only growing harrowing 
I should have no trouble now to keep from following ""
 maybe......

very very slowly and i havent got it all figured out yet but it could make things a little more meaningful for me. i spare everyone the gory details it just has to do with animal behavior stuff :) but i realised that i keep stumbling onto these patturns, the books I randomly read, working with Dr. Phelps and Dr. Sieving all this information is all starting to fit together in my brain to form a much bigger picture, but the image is still blurry.

"event","So over the course of yesterday afternoon (which, by the way, was awesome; Grounders is such a rad game!) I managed to knock out my nose piercing. I am not sure when or how but I got home around 11:45 and noticed it wasn't there, and my heart did a little lurch. I found a spare piercing, but I couldn't find the hole. So I found a straight piercing of the same gauge and proceeded to re-pierce my nose (there was a small layer of skin growing over the bottom). I've only had to do that once before, dear god it is painful! And stressful. I love my nose piercing so much... I don't want it to die!!! It has become a part of my face. Now I must make saline solution to clean it with...

Also:

Beccy, you will be unsurprised by this I am sure but:

YOU CAN TAKE ANIMATION AT EMILY CARR!?!?!?  ALSO, EMILY CARR ISN'T A PRIVATE SCHOOL!?!?!? I thought Emily Carr was super-expensive, like $18000 for a semester! <b>It is a regularily priced school.</b> Also it is in Vancouver? Ever since Kendra was telling me about her art school, I realized I really really want to go to Art school. D: God damn! I want a BFA in visual arts... but I also want to learn how to animate...

Does anyone else know of any kickin' art schools in BC?"

"event","Having Saturday off made me feel like I had this weekend off, but I do not (I work today). So, ideally, Saturday was supposed to be my exciting day, being as there was a Masquerade. Oddly enough, everything about this weekend EXCEPT the Masquerade was awesome. (And my hangover). 

Rachel took me on awesome adventures with her cool friends Friday night, where I remember drinking a lot of scotch and losing at guitar hero! I liked them. I really like meeting new people! It reminds me of when I was traveling, and would constantly be hanging out with new people every day! Guys, you all need to start introducing me to your friends that I don't know. We also went to Minglewoods where we saw Kris and the gang, and I recall talking to some british people? Kris was like ""OH MAN THERE ARE BRITISH PEOPLE!"" and I was like ""SAY WHAT?"" and went over to them to talk. About what? I am not sure! I don't remember the bus ride back very well, but apparently I got my picture taken. I woke up the next morning wanting to DIE, but after popping some advil and drinking a litre of water it went away, and I was left with the mild tingly feeling that I usually get when my hangovers recede, and that's okay. Then I went to Rockin' Johnny's and had a 2 hour non-stop conversation with Nathan. He is so adorable! :D Makes me want to ruffle his hair or something. 

Okay so I also liked the thunderstorm yesterday, as inconvenient as it was as I was dressed up. Also, I liked being dressed up and having a mask, and having people give me a 'what the hey?' kind of look. While waiting at Rideau for the bus going home, a little girl told me she liked my mask, and my dress (which was sparkly). She had a demeanor that was a mixture of shyness and guilty pleasure. She was 7 or 8, I'd guess. Then she told me that my friend (Julian, whom she saw me bussing with) was SCAAAAAARY!!! She lit up when she said this. I should draw it... anyway, because of his eye and his teeth, and I laughed and told her he was a big giant sweetheart really, but then her mom got paranoid that her daughter was talking to an oddly dressed stranger at a bus stop and took her inside.

Also, I miscalculated when j-walking across the street to my house, mainly because I was wearing heels and cannot walk nearly as fast with them on. Anyway, the car was coming and I realized I was only half-way to the other side, so I ran (awkwardly) and my ipod and cellphone fell out of my pocket into the middle of the rainy street, where a car proceeded to run my ipod over. I just kind of stood there gaping with my hands on my head letting out a sound resembling a mix between a strangled cry and a swear word. THAT'S MY MUSIC! Anyway, I ran out after the cars passed and grabbed my things, and my ipod <i>still worked</i>! I was so relieved. The edge of the screen is a little wonky (some pixels are missing) but you can barely tell and it plays perfectly fine! Score one for apple. My cellphone is also unharmed."

Baking is a lovely way to spend an overcast Saturday morning. I need to make cupcakes more often. Also, I wish I had food colouring! :( White icing with rainbow sprinkles it is.

...

Unless I flavour some with orange zest! :O And we have limes... would lime icing taste good?

Two hours later:

Oh, I guess I never posted this. Yes, lime icing tastes good! Oh god, I am on such a sugar high..."

"event","So I have completed two paintings in about 4 days. This is a new record for me. I painted this one with the idea of the freedom that I long for in mind, and although I like it well enough, there are parts of it that irk me... parts of it that don't seem right. Nonetheless, I thought I would post it 'cause I like the woman's pose. Defintely much less risque than my last painting.

"event","So under the cut is a picture of the painting I did! I may have mentioned to some of you, I may have not. I know some people expressed interest in seeing it? I just got really frusterated the other day and decided to, as my friend Kalina put it, let it all out in a fit of artistic madness. It was so much fun!! I forgot how much I love painting...

Anyway, I had no prior idea of what I was going to paint. Also this is up to your own interpretations, I guess. I realize in retrospect the arm is placed too high and it looks like it is coming out of her chest... but what can you do! Try harder next time I suppose.

"event","I want to write angry songs like Ani DiFranco writes angry songs... with passion and with excellent metaphors. But the words don't come to me. And I'm not angry. Sometimes I get frusterated but it isn't the same.

And I am kind of happy that I am not happy all the time anymore. I liked being on that two month high that I was on when I was travelling but feeling emotion, feeling sad and angry and crying and  not understanding makes me feel human. When I stay somewhere long enough to let the emotions come, they come. And that's okay. It means I have material with which to create art. 

Maybe I need to alternate between period of happiness, which motivates me to go out and accomplish things and experience life, and periods of sadness or intense emotion, which motivates me to do something artistic.

Ugh I have nothing interesting in my life to muse about, so I need to muse instead on my own thoughts. Folks, my life is predictable at the moment, and I don't like predictability so much."

"event","So like I'm reading the proposed budget for 2009 for the CIty of Ottawa, right?

I think it is kind of ridiculous, personally. From what I understand, he (Larry O'Brien) is cutting tons of services, healthcare, to keep taxes lower, and because he believes they can do better than just raising taxes to 4.9%. I understand, what with the failing economy and all, that we are on a tight budget, but I, personally, would not mind a higher tax in order to keep some of the things they are proposing to cut. 

For example, they are planning to: 
- cut funding to arts, culture, and heritage by 42% (a huuuge chunk)

- ELIMINATE funding to festivals and events, something that not only sucks because I like festivals, but which will be a loss for the hospitality and tourism buisness as well because it is a huge reason of why people come to Ottawa. Ironically, they claim in option 5 that they don't want to adjust services if it will affect the ""ability to attract people"" to Ottawa. Hmm. Correct me if I am wrong, but don't festivals generally attract people to a city? Isn't that one of our main tourist points, other than the museums? OH, but you're cutting funding to culture and heritage too, so that affects the museums. Do you want ANYONE to come here?
 
- cut funding for community and protective services (social housing units for people with addictions and mental illnesses, tenant resource centers, youth programs, childcare, etc.)

- cut funding towards Ottawa Health Plan, which means cutting jobs such as nutritionists, project managers, long-term healthcare, and NURSES? What the hell, Ottawa? Doesn't Canada desperately need nurses and you're FIRING them? Also, it says IN the document that results include ""delays and reduced access to some public health services as well as a reduction in investment of staff education and skills development"" (option 3). Delays in healthcare nowadays are already pretty bad, cut staff and wait lines will be longer, which will be detrimental to many patients.

- Eliminate outdoor rink grants while also raising the price of ice, thus resulting in 3200 less hours of ice available to the community at city-subsidized rates, making ice time more expensive.

Anyways, that's just a couple. 

Now the reason they are cutting such things as health care, from what I understand, is that the provincial government is supposed to pay about 25%  towards social services and healthcare, however the demand for funding grew in Ottawa and the amount from the province stayed the same, regardless. So the province's ""25%"" is really just a fixed rate. So the city has decided to lower the quality of our healthcare services so that we spend enough on it that the province's contribution is 25% once more. So essentially we are lowering our standards to meet the province's contribution. But we obviously have a demand for a certain level of healthcare. 

In a perfect world the provincial government should be paying 25% like they claimed they would, rather than a fixed amount which is clearly not enough. I hate to see our city losing nurses when, at the moment, there is a desperate need for nurses in Canada.

Now, I think these things are important to the city! Healthcare in Canada, due to the fact that it is free, has always been a point of pride among canadians. But cutting funding and staff does not make it any easier for the healthcare to remain free. Social Services are there to help people and clean the city up, (youth programs keep kids out of trouble, social housing will help people with addictions and mental illnesses, childcare helps single working mothers or families with low incomes). Cultural and Heritage institutes are integral to developing a national identity, and as the CAPITAL of our nation we should be developing these institutions rather than cutting them. Arts and festivals are important for attracting people to our city, and they generate money in the form of the tourism and hospitality industry. Personally, I wouldn't mind a hike in taxes if it meant healthcare, social services, and the arts didn't get cut. 

Anyways, god, I wrote a lot. If anyone has differing opinions please share! I'd like to learn more about opposing opinions. And if I've made some glaring error (which is possible as it is 1am) and its obvious that the city of Ottawa is making these cuts because if not the apocolypse may come or something, do let me know. This is just my opinion based on what I read."

Oh yeah I am back, I have been writing in my other journal, <lj user=kimplusireland> for the past 10 months but Ireland is over, alas, so I am reverting back to this journal. Ayep.

I need to find a job, MEC (Mountaineering Equipment Co.) is hiring in Westboro, I think I may apply!! Also Lost Marbles, and I want to apply at the Jail Hostel. Yay! Laura said she would try get me into the studio, which would be fantastic! But budgets are tight so I need to start applying in the likely case that they can't afford to hire me back.

I am going crazy without a job.

But I have a cellphone! And its FANCY. It slides and has a keyboard for texting and its like Alana's."

Yes, that means the cat got my tongue and I was left silent on the other end. I do not even know where to begin. Ok,&nbsp;I am going to start off&nbsp;admitting that YES, it&nbsp;is my fault we are&nbsp;left&nbsp;in this state&nbsp;of mind because&nbsp;I did not think before I spoke. But hey, I am only human. I make mistakes too, and at times a lot of it. That's my bad on my part and I&nbsp;know for a solid fact that I can't do anything about that. I cannot turn back time and rewind everything to make it all gravy. With that fact, I cannot say anything to you but sorry (whether you believe me or not, I do not know). I know I called you names and said numerous hurtful things; things that even if i wanted to.. cannot take back. It's been said. With that thing that i blurted out, I do not expect you to believe me when I say that it isn't true (even though it isn't). Here&nbsp;I am telling you that everything that we went through, and all those times that we were together is genuinely true and for a goddamn fact is not a lie. IT'S NOT A LIE. I do not know how else to tell you. I don't know. I've said it a bajillion million times before and here I am saying it again. I haven't given up trying to convince you otherwise. Fact is, it is my fault, it is. I know it. With that, I know you think I'm crazy and psycho but so be it. I don't really care. So, I guess that's it. I'll leave you alone now and don't worry I REALLY WILL THIS TIME. NO matter what I say there's no convincing you. This is my last ode to you:<strong> I ""jesus"" you.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><font size=""3"">-Erika</font></p>"

But tomorrow is back to my reality!&nbsp;Went to&nbsp;Janelle and Bosing's birthday dinner&nbsp;at Montana. Guess what I had! I had a dish that was spicy :|.... yes... I know. Then, dance practice for Kim's debut. Intense I tell you but it was worth it! It was also Ben's birthday which had like&nbsp;three parts to it. Ben and Andrew slept over. We had lunch at Korean Grill House. Guess what I had again?! No, nothing spicy. But I had noodles at Korean BBQ. You know why? Because I couldn't have rice (N). Good times with Holy Cross people though. Spent some gooooood quality time with the Trio and slept over there. Finally took pictures with them two loves. Lastly, also spent some gooooood quality time with Mr. Gay, haha. The name can remain undisclosed. Reason being... I'm being gay. But onto more important things... <br /><br />The highlight of my break was indifinitely South Scarb's Camp Redemption! I served my chapter by becoming a facilitator to Valerie, Marian and Maria (along with Jessca of course!). I also did a share with Diamond. For that, I must have said a million prayers with Diamond because of anxiety*shrugs*. Anyway,&nbsp;I'm so happy that I was priviledged enough to serve at camp because all the things that I went through went straight to heart. A great new experience for me. And I can't wait for the next time I serve for YFC. We had our ups and downs at camp but overall we succeeded and that's all that matters! God is <em>GOOD.<br /></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></font></div>

I am the most beautiful boogie man
The most beautiful boogie man
Let me be your favorite nightmare
Close your eyes and ill be right there
While...Open...All...Over...A-gain...Ag-ain

<b>Jenn's birthday thang:</b>
Yes, we had a theme and yes it was Hawaiian :)
Jessca is so gay and Dame girrls are nuts!
The food was good though it was spicy.
I sang until the mic was pried out of my hands (for their sake).
Lastly, walking and waiting for the bus was deadly! Thawing at home was great!

<B>Korean BBQ w/ Family:</b>
Probably the last time were gonna have dinner with my grandma.
My dad was using the tongs to eat with. 
The parents pigged out on the liver, which was fricking disgusting.
Me, Yan and Rheya had a good poserific time. ha. 
Fuck, I'm gonna miss my grandma."

"event","ASSLEY, your debut was live. I had fun. :) Sorry about being 
late and you looked GORGEOUS! I loved how everyone was 
matching :). TOO CUTE! Our table had fun with the centrepieces, 
that's for sure! My elementary folks were there, that was even 
more of a plus. And Jem, you motherfucker, stop working and 
come out with us! I broke almost everything that I touched. 
My rose broke in two (luckily a guy had a another one and 
randomly gave it to me), my brooch was messed up, and my jewel
on my candle ring broke off. But other than that it was great!
haha. I had such a great time being Jem's partner! He's jokes 
and our little stories about us growing up with our big brothers 
and sisters are definitely unforgettable! The dance portion was 
fun. YOU KNOW HOW WE DO! ha. And the after party? under age 
drinking is great. haha. I was responsible that night, like what 
my mommie asked. I became the caretaker for the night for Grizzy, 
that drunk. haha. Andrew, you are jokes for life!

There no words that can explain how much I love these guys. We grew up with each other.
We've seen one another in every single phase and every change that we have gone through. 
It's just amazing how we can be apart for so long and then see each other like we saw each
other yesterday. These guys are truly people that I can see at my debut, wedding, my kid's 
baptism and so on. We went from being sticks to being `meatier` or chubs chubs to slim fit
or from bowl cuts to clean cut. ha. I truly love these guys."

I can't explain what happened to me and all the emotions I had all mixed up in one.
The talks and shares were heartfelt and relatable.
The activities were nothing short of awesome and fun.
The lady bondage that went on at night.
The bonding and relationship building that went on all weekend!
The things that we learned in the talks are indefinitely what we need to go about life.
The burning of our burdens is one of the greatest feeling in the world.
The songs are used as communication between God and I.
My parents are so great. I love them so much. I want to thank them for being here for me.. and for Jess too when her parents couldn't make it.
I'm all cried out for all the right reasons. Tears of joy :)
<b>Being able to let go, repent, forgive and heal is what I'm learning to do.. is what I need to do.</b>
God's path is my path in life. God loves me. 

(8)one way Jesus You're the only one that I could live for.
You are the way the turth and the life 
we live by faith and not by sight for You
were living it all for You(8)

"event","<p align=jutify>So it's Halloween and today was good :). The school day itself was mediocre. So we had our costume stand up assembly and it's great every year. This year Chevonne won with her agent personna from men in black, she's hilarious, cute and fun! I'm glad she won ^.^. And then after that was our last home game against People's Christian Academy. By far the best game everrrrr! We went crazy cheering our school on. It was a close game but of course with amount of spirit that we had :) we won! I got home at around six thirty ish, ate and then went trick or treating with Rheya. and surprise surprise, she went as a princess. Got back at around 8 and ate her chocolate. Our neighbours are so cute! A couple of them made special treats for Rheya... too cute! So overall it was good day :). 

A change from such a horrible week I had last week (of with the exception of Pooks' birthday). This week better be good. I mean c'mon! It's my birthday on Friday, were having dinner, and with the planning+preparation with jenny and jesscaaa?! I can't wait. Plus I had a talk with my mom about our trip to the Philippines! Guys, I'm leaving December 11th so don't miss me too much (especially you tin!). First days there, my mom and I are going shopping with my aunts, the first friday there were leaving to go to my dad's family in Pangasinan and we come back the tuesday. What else are we doing? well, shopping, shopping and more shopping! :D How exciting eh!? She named a few places that we were visiting too! Makati City, SM mall, and my mom's hometown, Bulacan I can't wait to meet my cousins and relatives there! I can't wait to see what it's like there! I just can't wait! :D.

It's been a while since I've been at a airport (summer of gr. 9). I'm excited but apprehensive at the same.</center>

Lastly, I had a conversation with a smart but cocky person just a minute ago. I never thought that I could agree with someone who phrased what he said to me in such a blunt and somewhat mean way and still be able relate to it. His exact words to me, ""he doesn't wanna deal with you. yo im single for life, fuck all the relationships. i can do what i want when i want. u should be like that. stop stressing over 1 guy theres enough boys out there."" What a thing to say eh? Was I such a horrible person to him(a retorical question)? Like c'mon QUEEERR! *smiles* just kidding. But nonetheless what he said is true. I think that it's about time to have MORE fun with the boys. (Y)"

To add to it I just fucked myself in a deep, deep hole and shit did not go to well. You might think of me as a bitch but it's just me getting what I feel and what I think you of out of my system. Just to get things straight, I don't think you're a player and I certainly don't think of you as an unwanted memory. If you don't believe me that's fine but I just want you to hear it for another millionth time. I completely understand what you said and I repect you're priorities, whether girls are on it or not, but don't get me wrong I meant what I said with you and the leading on business. But hey, overtime people change and I learn to accept things and although I really don't see the light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak, I can adapt to it. I didn't mean to piss you off about it. What can I say. I was disappointed, angry and confused. Most of all, I hate it when I can feel my face go hot and when I see my face turn red. I like you but I hate you, I want to talk to you but all I do is yell and cuss, I think about us being together but I can't stand you and I think you're alright but you tell me you're an asshole. how the fuck do you figure? <i>HOW THE FUCK DO YOU FIGURE?</i>HOW THE FUCK DO YOU FIGURE?!"

<lj-cut text=""give the guy a break will ya?"">
<p align=justify>this has been an issue that tin and i have been talking about in school. we came up with girls are just as fucked up as much as guys are. we noticed that a lot of girls complain about guys comin up short in terms of our expectaions. honestly, it's ridiculous how much we expect of them. some girls complain that the guy is annoying just because he's expressing i guess in an aggressive way that he wants to be with her and at the same time we get frustrated and annoyed when the guy does nothing at all because he respects you or just doesn't wanna rush things with you. really it's ridiculous how we want them to do everything in a relationship. and i frown upon myself because i was one of those girls that complained about every single thing that the guy did wrong. i failed to give the guy a break. furthermore, you have these girls that have pasts with a certain guy and they're still friends but when you talk to them about another guy that you might be interested in all of a sudden they are all uptight and getting into your business. that ever happen to you? well i say to you and all the other girls, why not just leave him out of it... ALL of it? that way he won't try to run your life and you can do whatever you want with the new guy. i mean COME ON. what does telling him about ayour life mean anyways? that you might have feelings for him? its just me two cents. no matter how much history two people of the opposite sex have.. it can never go back to the way things were. it's just not possible. haha girls honestly have such high standards for guys that i actually praise them if they actually get the girl. ha! what the girls problem is that we fail to communicate what we expect of them and please if you say that they should already know im gonna shoot you. quite literally, how are they supposed to know what we are thinking?! they are a completely different species almost. they have a different mind set and act completely different (were from venus and they are from mars remember?) how can they possibly know what we want them to do? the fact is that they can't read minds or even begin to imagine what we expect of them so do yourself and the guy a favor and communicate! easy said than done is what you might say to me but once you overcome this whole communication barrier, it will be a lot easier for you and him in the future. it takes two for everything. it takes two to make a relationship work or crash and burn. its a two way street. as much as we would like to blame the guy for everything we are as bad as they are. </lj-cut>"

"event","So, today i woke up late for school. I think it was about eight o'clock and so i run downstairs with my towels and robe and kicked my mom out of the bathroom so that i could shower. Showered at a hot ten minutes! Threw some clothes together because we had civies today and quickly tried to apply make up you know the mascara and all that but with no time what so ever i looked like shit. In the midst of all that rushing to get to school, I didn't get to eat my eggs and bacon with hot chocolate that my mom made. On top of that, my dad fell asleep and I hate waking him up cause he gets cranky like me.. and he so after like a good 5 minutes of him ranting on and on we finally left my house at like 8:55 (5 minutes before school started). While i was trying to get my stuff together in the van, i realized that i left my papers at home for my project/presentation today and with totally no time go back i just let it go. So, overall my morning was crap! with all the rushing and chaos and people telling to hurry up and stuff. UGH horrible! It was our daily routine to listen to flow in the morning during our car ride. Then, those favourite songs of mine came on.. and I was wondering why they cut it short and then an announcer came on... revealing the greatest news to my ears. JOHN LEGEND IS HAVING A CONCERT AT MASSEY HALL ON NOVEMBER 27TH. and how do you think i reacted to this news?! OMG i yelled for joy. i was so happy, like i just had the best sex with the hottest man alive on earth over and over again. It completely turned my whole day around. from a crap rushed morning to smiling the whole day because of John Legend. I truly cannot wait. But it's gonna dig a huge hole in my pockets that's supposed to be for the Philippines in December but seriously, I truly cannot pass up John Legend. He is too great of an lycrist, pianist, and singer to pass up. I just can't wait to him live again. ahhhh. =)"

The past three years has been wow amazing, its only fair that we make our last year the craziest, loudest and the most unforgettable year of the all. last year of high school, i welcome you. 

got damn i hate to say it but summer... my love... goodbye. its been fun and i hate to see you leave. its not even worth doing a whole highlight of my summer. everything i've done was great and ahhh. dammnn my freedom is gone and now im limited :|. outings with everyone.. ahh man so great. =) who would have thought that i would still have outings with andrew after he lied to marge and i on multiple occasions, that the elementary thing would actually go through, and that i pulled a marilyn monroe moment HA! and summer school. ohh summer school, i miss you. soo many great times with you hot shits! all i have to say is one word and you'd know if you were live. hahah.... *drum roll* VOLLEYBALL! :D oh thanh, oh thanh. and and OUR not only mine.. haha but our summerschool boyfriends. :D. ha. great timesss. we've branded ourselves crackheads that yelled and laughed at the top of our lungs. summer's been great times a million.

i come home at late everyday and it's been hella good.
i just can't remember it all

here's a tip for you;
go out and go out like you've never been out before.

here's another tip for you; do not make promises that you cannot keep. it's one of my pet peeves. i hate the fact that people can't keep the promises that they make. one thing i learned from past experiences is that i too can't keep promises and is one of the reasons why i rarely make promises to people or can't give a straight answer to some questions. i would hate to disappoint people or getting their hopes up. or my case, getting upset over someone breaking a promise. dont promise anyone anything if you don't intend to keep it. cause once it's broken been that person is left feeling disappointed and feeling like that's person's been lied to. 

just a tidbit for you.

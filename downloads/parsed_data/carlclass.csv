Okay, so many of you are freaking out about your Holes Test Questions assignment. Many of you THINK you got an F on the assignment! BUT NO! Actually, Carl just messed up (derp!). The default setting on PowerSchool makes each assignment worth 10 pts. This assignment was only worth 5, but I did not change the default to 5. So it looks like you all got 5/10 but really you got 5/5 or an A plus! So I just fixed it. Please check PowerSchool again for an updated grade. I'm sorry to cause any alarm!"

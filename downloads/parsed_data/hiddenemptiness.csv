all the sweet nothings that you never meant.
lay in the grass and watch the stars,
while you tell me what ive done wrong again.
sometimes i think that you honestly try and drown me,
when you leave me standing in the rain.
sometimes i want to just smother you
and watch you stuggle for your next breath.
hush little baby dont you cry
now im gonna sing you a lullaby
and when i sing that song off key
i guess ill have to buy you a diamond ring
and if that fucking ring dont shine
ill shove it down your ungreatful throat
i mean damn i sang to you and its not enough?
i bought you a ring and that means nothing?

"event","First..get a pen and paper. When you actually
choose names, make sure it's people you actually
know and go with your first instinct.

Scroll down one line at a time...and don't read
ahead or you'll ruin it!














1. First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a
column.














2. Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write down any
two numbers you want.












3. Beside the 3 and 7, write down the names of
members of the opposite sex.












NO LOOKING AHEAD...OR IT WON""T TURN OUT RIGHT!




4. Write anyone's name (like friends or
family....) in the 4th, 5th, and 6th spots.












5. Write down four song titles in 8,9,10, and 11.












GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT PEOPLE!!!!




6. Finally, make a wish.













And now the key for the game.....






1. You must tell (the number in space 2) people about this game.













2. The person in space 3 is the one that you love.












3. The person in 7 is one you like but can't ever seem to work out.












4. You care most about the person you put in 4.













5. The person you name in number 5 is the one who knows you very well.













6. The person you name in 6 is your lucky star.













7. The song in 8 is the song that matches with the person in number 3.












8. The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7














9. The tenth space is the song that tells you most about YOUR mind.













10. and 11 is the song telling you how you feel about life







NOW...post this bulletin (dont reply) within the
hour... IF you do..
your wish will come true...
If you don't it will become the opposite..."

now, on a lighter note!  i wore a purple dress shirt today with a black tie.  i liked it, oddly enough.  i think im gonna do that more often.  i didnt go to cousino today, i just chilled in freitags class 4th hour, and then i went to schades class for 5th.  it was cool, we made fun of all the dumbasses in her class.  my sister monica came up for the weekend, and shes still here!  i missed hanging out with her, shawns a good guy.  me and him just fuck off and play video games a lot.  my niece lydia is sooooo cute, i see her and it reminds me of how much i want kids!  but thats a whole nother story!



man im tired as a mofo, i kept telling her i wasnt sleepy.  but once i hung up, i was out.  i didnt want to let her go, i didnt want to hang up.  i swear im better than this, i know i am.  why am i doing this, i know its wrong.  i tell her all the time, i tell her everyday.  but i dont care, i dont know how else to feel.



more family came up on sunday, my brother jody, his wife, his kids [kayla, and micheal]  and kaylas friend allie.  i took the kids to the park and we played around, it made me sad  cause i think of how badly i want to be a father.  it made me sadder when i thought about why i dont have a family, and when i used to play on the swings.  i dont want my kids to look back and think about their childhoods and regret everything about it.  i want them to say [those were the best years of my life, i have the best dad in the world].  i know ill be a good daddy.  its making me miss some people right about now.  so i think ill leave it on that note.  and for what its worth, im sorry."

[i just want these cuts and scars to go away and not remind me of anything, but evertime they start to i magically appear with more.  and i have no true friends, but i see this beautiful switch blade that i want to become intimate with.  and i think we will]

is this what im reduced to?  is this all that i have?  i used to think i had more to look forward to, but now that i dont have her...i know that i am nothing.  everytime i try and be happy for a while, i end up screwing myself over.  and apparently its all my fault, now she and i arent talking at all.  i made a simple comment, i was bored, i wanted to know that she cared, i didnt want to hurt her when im gone, is that a crime?  is it wrong if i never have what i want?  not having her must be right, otherwise why would it hurt so much.  and all you do is sit and read this and think[oh poor nick, hes depressed again].  but you're wrong, im dying.  without my life, i slowly die each day without her.  and i barely know her, so i must move on and find someone to take my mind off of her.  does anyone want to be that person?!  i didnt think so."

"event","well, life was good about 5 months ago.  and it got a little better, then aroung june it all went downhill from there.  straight to the shitter.  now i got this girl that i really like, but cant do anything with.  shes older, and i had this major crush on her for the longest time.  but i dont know what the hell happened, i told her how i felt.  and now im a complete mess, i dont want to wake up in the morning i dont eat i dont sleep[as if i ever did before] i dont want to be anywhere.  i see all these people making out in the halls and all i want to do is die, im so fucking dead right now.  i honestly wouldnt care if you walked up to me and punched me in the face.  and im  not saying that im like this because of her, but i dont know.  it all started when i realized how much i liked her.  but nothing will happen, she doesnt like me like that, and she doesnt want to go out with a guy thats still in high school.  ive been stoned for damn near the past week straight.  i dont want to live here anymore, i come home and all i do is get screamed at.  and then they dont understand why i want to die.  school is okay, i used to like it.  now its gay, i have all these cute girls in my classes.  and i know i have no shot whatsoever with any of them.  all these guys tell me to get a fuck buddy, but i cant.  im not that kind of guy, i cant just fuck someone and leave them.  no matter what, you mean something to the other person.  thats why youre doing what you are.  ive been writing songs again, they are all depressing and gay.  i want to record this one song for that girl i like, but i have no way of doing so.  and i want to make her happy, make someone happy.  but i cant even make myself happy.  out of nowhere i just start crying, and i cant stop.  i want to i just cant, if it doesnt quit soon i dont know what im gonna do to myself.  i dont want to leave alone, but i always seem to let you down.  these feelings i cant keep inside, for so long ive been empty.  so take a look at what you've left behind, take a look at what you've done to me.  all the things that used to make me happy dont anymore, and the ones who used to make me happy.  are gone.  im so lonely, so depressed, so empty that im angry.  im so angry that i want to hurt someone.  i want to hurt someone so bad that i cant, because i know if i do i wont stop.  so i hurt myself.  and the more i hurt myself the less i want to be me.  so i sleep at night and dream of being somebidy else.  but my dreams dont last long, they are always followed by a void that i cant escape.  thats life for me, short lived happiness followed by endless nothings.  and thats all ill ever be, an endless nothing.  always there[endless], but never to be loved, touched, noticed, hell even spat on[nothing].  i want to end it all and leave you broken in the wake of my memories.  but i cant, im not that kind of person.  everything i want is put on hold, due to your feelings.  and i dont care, i have always put you before me.  and that will never change.

oh, and im offline for the next forever, dont bother calling i wont answer.  if you want to talk to me, grow some balls and come see me.  nobody goes out of their way for me anymore, i miss that like you wouldnt believe.  if anyone gives a shit, tell me."

"event","wow, life has sucked since the last forever.  i keep going for what i cant get, even after i KNOW i cant get it.  im so confused about what im gonna do with the rest of me, i say the rest of me for a reason.  everyone i know, all i have loved, that have left me, have taken what they wanted from me.  then walked away, and nobody knows what its like inside my head, it hurts to have that happen.  and yet i keep going after it, i love being hurt.  i cant live without my pain, its the broken heartedness that keeps me going.  thats why im not happy with being happy.  thats why i always fuck everything up.  its that drive for self-destruction that makes me get attached, to fall in love and then rip out my heart.  and unfortunately, demolish others in my path.  but thats me and i honestly dont give a fuck.  if i hurt you, get over it.  and now that im not in love with anyone anymore.  zoja, sallie, micah.....pretty much everyone i have loved, is gone.  my mom, my family....my home.  the one who makes me stay up at night and wonder what i could have done.  the one who makes me feel all tingly inside, i cant stand being near her.  i cant stand hearing her voice, seeing her in my dreams.  dont call, dont try and talk to me in any way, shape, or form.  just leave me the fuck alone.  i know im about to rip your heart out too.  so to keep you from pain, or feeling like shit, or making you regret doing what you did, leave me alone.  i dont know you, dont want to know you.  and i dont care if i wake up tomorrow, i dont care if i cry anymore, or who sees me do it.  cause without my tears i have nothing, cause you have taken it all.  every night i stayed up and talked to you, helped you through your problems, meanwhile im dying inside.  i talk you through it all, make you laugh, make you cry, make you feel flattered.  when i do things that get me in trouble just so i can see you.  and everytime i talk to you, i compliment you.  i go out of my way just so i can have a chance to catch a glimpse or your beautiful face.  just so that you can realize how wonderful i really am, to show you i really would do anything to make you happy.  but all that effort is in vain, because apparently ill never be good enough for you.  everything i am isn't ANYTHING that you need.  im never good enough for anyone.  im not good enough for this world, not good enough for family.  but thats changing, my brother[hal] called my other brother[manuel] and talked to him, and my brother[jody].  then they called my sister[monica] and told her that they wanted to talk to me.  they actaully want to get to know me.  so i am good enough for family.  and yet again, someone i dont know that well cares more about me than the rest of you."

ME!!!  yeah, youre right.  whoever wins, is getting majorly screwed.  but anyways the feeling in the stomach is probably just the taco bell acting up.  damn mexicans!!  well garsh, im gonna shut up before all the girls i know read this and get pissed at me.  so..........

THEN.....my dad came in and realized we were in violation of the *no touchy* rule.  we went out to dinner, and got home and went to the park.  we walked around for a while, then we saw nick scott.  and low and behold, there was a [gathering] of people i havent seen in forever.  oh the drama, nick slapped some bitch, she yells.  dave starts shit with everybody.  me and some girl have to pee, bathrooms are closed.  i pee, she doesnt, she hates me for peeing.  wow i make friends easily now dont i?  somebody found beer, then jesse showed up.  then all went home.  we walked sallie and krystal to sallie's house.  waited for angela[krystals ride] and she went home so jesse made me leave, i ran to sallie's window.  and we talked a little bit, then i realized that jesse was still walking.  we got home and i got yelled at for being late.  jesse went home, grabbed the rest of the beers on the way.  got home and was drunk.  sallie and i talked, then we fought, as usual.  but this time it was about zoja.  so that was fun, she went to bed mad at me.  and i went to bed feeling like shit, as usual.  i miss sallie, the thunder last night was fuckin crazy.  i loved it.  she isn't on so now im bored out of my mind.  and i have nothing to do today.  unless she gets on soon thats how its gonna be.  so oh well, im gone now.

Prom is coming up and I'm so excited.
Angela was talking crap about some of my pictures at the studio.  I took a picture of this girl kissing her boyfriend for prom and she was like ah thats bad blah blah blah. And she didn't even talk to me about it.  She just told everyone else how much she hated it and Kim eventually told me. Psh. 
i want the jason mraz CD, and also rob thomas and carbon leaf. OH! i have an important question. 
<b>DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO SINGS THE SONG THAT GOES:</b>
<i>and i know it wasnt right, but it felt so good. and ur mother didn't mind like i thought she would. and an REM song was playin in my mind... something something something, it felt like a lifetime.</i>

a guy sings it. its the greatest new song ever and i love it.
OH - LORENZO! AHHH me and jenn switched boyfriends but i dont think i'll go out with him, even tho he'll probably ask me to.  i got  really upset when jenn did that to me, so why stoop to that?  
but then, i guess i already did with james and all that stuff. even tho we didn't go out.
ok, time to go.

But I don't know... he's changed a little bit, but he's still the same horny I-want-to-get-in-your-pants guy.  I don't know.  I wasn't all that impressed.
My mom was talking about colleges today and it made me mad. I don't know why.  I want to decide where I want to go all by myself without her and my dad and grandparents and cousins and blah blah blah pushing for me to go to a Mormon college, like it's the optimal choice, the best thing in the world.

everything with jon just seems to be going downhill and it's really exhausting being depressed about it. the first two or three days after i realized we were losing eachother, i just let myself fall apart and it was absolutely awful. but now im just trying to keep it together and focus on field hockey.  gosh, i wish i hadn't ever cheated on him.  it ruinned everything for us.  im such a stupid girl sometimes. grrrrowl. >:o\ i really thought me and jon had it good; everything seemed so perfect for us and i honestly couldn't see anything ever going wrong. and i still like him a lot.  he wants to be with me still, and i want to be with him. but the relationship is broken... i don't know.  i guess i'll just see what happens these next couple weeks. *sigh*
i wish i just had someone that i could talk to and not worry about what he's thinking. i wish i could tell him everything. i wish i had a guy who i knew loved me and i loved back. i wish i was really comfortable around him. i wish i had someone to hold me really tight when i was sad and make me smile <i>no matter what.</i>

matt: in a loving, caring, girlfriend sort of way?

matt: not as huge as me, though, right?
sunnie: lol... what?
matt: hey, this is off records, ok?
sunnie: what?
matt: and i won't tell jon about ""US""

and that's pretty much the extent of the conversation.  this guy is his best friend PLUS, matt has a very sweet, long term girlfriend, so what's the deal??? help me!!! i dont know what to do when he says stuff like that... i mean, he always flirts with me a little bit, but he's never hit on me like THAT. and i can't be mean. its not me. and matt is my friend too. i dont know what to do. i dont want to ruin jon and matt's friendship, but ugh... help?"

i got a new puppy named sadie. shes so cute. i love that little punk.

thomas and his old g/f, rian, are arguing about how thomas was supposed to stay single so they could get back together when summer started.  and that was the plan... until me and thomas reunited and hooked up again. and so she was getting all pissed off at me and screaming her lungs out at thomas. and so im responsible for that. side note: rian is absolutely gorgeous.  her body is perfect and she smiles like an angel.  in my opinion, i am the ugly duckling and she is the swan.  why does he f-ing wants me?? i am clueless.
and then secondly... i opened my big mouth and said some stuff that i apparently should have kept to myself and now david has broken up with sharilyn. gah. again, my fault.

"event","last night, me, matt, jenn and kat went to putt putt, which was really boring. so we left to matts and he was havin a big get together over there.  beer, cigarettes, drugs, everything.  it was crazy.  i didnt touch a thing, tho. honest.
then we went to rick's and he showed me his new motorbikes.  we watched the Blair Witch Project (ahhhh!!!) and gave eachother massages.  rick practically had an orgasm lol, he said i was the best masseuse ever.  :o)  then i fell asleep, and when i woke up, we were back at kat's house.  
today i saw john's little white bootie.  it was interesting.  i spent the night with david, dimbo, laura, brittney, keith, brandon and john.  we just walked around and did stupid stuff.  it was pretty fun.  but i think it's more fun when it's just me and david hanging out, or me and keith and brandon and david.  but all of david's friends are cool anyway, i guess.
kat got baptised today and that was pretty cool. her parents came which is a pretty big deal since they live so far away.  and of course rick didn't show up.  woop woop...
so now im sitting here in fuzzy yellow pajama pants and Paul Frank tank top and thinking about Ryan's nice eyes.  mmmm
xo

"event","I cry but I have no real reason too.  My g/f broke up with me today, but it isn't even that big of a deal.  I acted like I didn't care at all, but then I sat down at the lunch table.  Eric and I still aren't talking and then I heard my friends whispering about how I was sooo melodramatic and all this shit.  I don't even know why, but I just dropped my head and the tears came pouring down my face.  I walked through the hall with my head down the rest of the day.  I don't even know how I got thru practice.  It was hell.  All of it.  And now I have some  viral infection called herpemengina and it sounds like an STD, but its really not.  And gah...  I'm worried about david.  i love him. i really do."

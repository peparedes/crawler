"event","11:30 AM... woke up feeling like a herd of horses shit in my mouth... alcohol-caused dehydration is NOT fun. Note to self: next time, drink less & dance more :)
 Woke up just as H. walked into the room... love the black frilly panties! Wish I could wake up every day to this sight. Got my stuff together, found the celly, and got the hell out of there.
 12 noon... hit B&N for something to read over breakfast. Found a decent encyclopedia of classic cars (should be useful for style references for that project) and a collection of rants called ""101 Damnations"". Gotta love the Bargain Bin! 2 books, $ 10. Shweet!
 12:30 PM - breakfast at Denny's. So sue me, I know the place sucks but there's really nothing else around here. And I'm getting tired of the usual routine of low-carb Monsters + bagels from 7/11. Besides, it's a friggin' weekend, so for once I can have breakfast in peace. Flirted with the waitress until I found out she's 17. Damn I hate getting old!
 1:15 PM - got to work and brewed a fresh pot of joe. Let the stomach-lining destruction begin! Hehe. Fired up DI.FM so I can get my fill of techno for the day (once again, sue me, I like techno!).
 4:00 PM - looked over the pile of parts I processed, decided it's time to take a break. Spent about an hour kicking the shit out of people on Internet Reversi and out of my lungs with the Parliaments. Got bored. Went back 2 work.

 List cars on eBay, process parts, smoke cigs, chat with the ladies, process more parts... damn I'm bored.

 9:30 PM - H. called me with a request to supply some greens. Called up Dr.Dre and negotiated a 4.5 for 100. And now, for an encore, cue soundtrack... ""SHWEET!"" Thank you, Cartman! :)
 10:06 PM - boy finally showed up to collect the cash. Damn, dealing with stoners is like watching paint dry. Note to self: when open own office, screen for drugs. Definitely.
 that's it so far."

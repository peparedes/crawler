So thats 3 of my 5 brothers I've slept with.  Deffinatly a slut.  And deffinatly got some sort of problem that should be dealt with.  I doubt this is healthy.  And I doubt Ron will ever speak to me again.  I hope no one asks why he avoids me like the plague anytime the family gets together.  That could be bad.  I hope Bill doesn't get that way.  Didn't seem like he would though.  And George and I, well, that is still left to be seen.

Um, sorry?  I said a lot of things I shouldn't have, along with the fact that I did something I probably shouldn't have, and I'm sorry you freaked out.  I think we should talk or something.  You're still my brother and you always will be.  I love you.  

P.S.  If it would be better maybe I can get Oliver to do some memory charms?  Laugh, that was supposed to be funny.

Uh, so thats the last Hogwarts party I go to.  The last time I drink firewhiskey too.  Oops?"

Bill,

Hey bro!  Long time eh?  Oliver told me about a club you guys went to.  Said it was fab.  Would you be up for taking your dear brother out for a night on the town tomorrow?  I could use a trip out.  Owl me tomorrow.  We'll have a blast.  And I promise to leave the tricks at home... 

Love,
Your darling brother Forge"

And now we're not in quite as much money trouble.  We can probably keep the shop.  I haven't asked George yet, but once he does the books for the month I know he'll tell me.

Thanks for the date Tes.  It was a lot of fun!  We'll have to hang out more often.  Come see me at the shop if you're ever bored.  You can check out some things we're developing and tell me what you think."

"event","Oliver ole boy, happy birthday!  Hope its treating you well.  Sorry I can't come out to the castle and see you.  Thats George's job.  Hopefully you'll be around when he stops by today.  If you'd like to come by the store, you know, the birthday boy who just happens to be our friend shops free.  Have a happy one mate.  Miss you!

Hope he's not as depressed as I am.  Poor Oliver.  I still remember that night out by the lake.  I know he and Harry reconsiled after that, but it still hurt him.  I think Oliver just feels too deeply.  He lets his emotions get the best of him, and then he's stuck in a difficult situation.  I wish I could help him.  Hold him like we did that night and tell him everything would be alright.  Even if it wasn't going to be.  Oliver just needs someone to hold him and love him all the time.  He craves it, and when he doesn't have enough he goes looking for more.  I just wish I could do something.  

I wish I could do something for me as well.  George and I don't really seem to be that any more.  He's George, and I'm Fred and thats it.  Its like we don't even connect anymore.  I feel him sometimes, but other times its like he's pushing againts me and I'm pushing against him.  Almost like he wants to keep me out, and since he wants to keep me out, I try to keep him out then too.  I should just talk to him... sit him down and tell him whats going on.  I'm afraid he'll find someone else.  I mean, it doesn't bother me that he would, just that he won't tell me.  I wouldn't mind sharing him as long as we still had us.  But we don't, and thats what's scaring me the most.  I miss him, and I've never had to miss him before in my life.  Because he's always been right there inside of me.  And now he's not...

Hey George.  When you get back from your delivery if I haven't already seen you please come find me.  We have a few things we should discuss."

"event","I never can manage to stay current with this thing.  It always slips my mind that I could be writing in here.  Guess thats alright though, considering everyone else doesn't update this thing constantly either.  

Buisness has been picking up a little since we started to do deliveries.  <b><i> Hopefully enough to keep us on our feet...</i></b>  I've been shirking on my duties in the lab, but only because I haven't been feeling much creativity lately.  I'll probably go restock the shelves in a bit.  I don't think we've done any inventory in ages.  I'll have to go look down in the store room.  

[private]
Maybe I can pull out that box from the top shelf.  Its been such a long time, and I badly miss the intimacy that George and I shared...  That box should prove to be an interesting spark, and hopefully it'll kick start us being us again.  I should go do that now, and then go see George...

"event","I've been runing to and fro lately, and no matter what I seem to conjure up, buisness still seems a little slow.  Hopefully with the approaching holidays, and now that the students are back at school, buisness will pick up a bit.  I'm not all that worried though.  We've survived before, and we can do it again.  After all, we're Weasleys.

Haven't seen much of George lately.  Strange, since we live in the same house, work in the same store, and even occationally share a bed.  We're not doing so much of that as we used to, and I miss him.  I've never been as close to anyone as I am to George, and with good reason, but it seems that lately he's been distant.  I suppose I haven't made the effort to bring us back closer either, but I don't think I'm pushing him away.  It feels a little like George is hiding something from me, and I wonder what I did to make him feel like there are things he can't tell me.  We're one soul, in two bodies, and we should be closer than anyone. I miss him.

Everyone should look forward to a whole lot of new items hitting the shelves soon.  10% off on the next Hogesmede weekend for all Hogwarts students planning on mischeif for teachers.  We've got a few doozies that are in the last stages of testing.  Hopefully they'll be done soon, and we'll be none the worse for wear, though I've been blue with purple spots for a few days now after... well, never mind."

Everything just stops, and you can hear the music swelling in your head, brining itself to a climax as the birds fly through the clear sun bright sky.  Your chest pounds and your heart races ad you just can't see anyone but that special person.  For a moment, your breath catches in your throat and it feels as if all your oxygen has been stolen, till you realize that you can breathe, and the whole reason for breathing is right in front of you.  Its like, when you're together, you are whole... you are one person, and without them, you would only be half as much as you are when the two of you are together."

And Dad, tell Mum I got her letter and to stop pestering me and George about wives.  Girls don't appreciate jokes like us boys, and they'd just get in the way.  After all, if she wants us to be successful buisness men, she has to let us start running our own lives.  

Oh and George, I'm going out this afternoon to pick up a few things for the shop.  Don't make dinner, I'm going to bring something good home to cook.  I'll see you at home tonight.  Don't blow up anything important while I'm gone."

Sometimes the silence is unnerving.  George must've gone out, and its rather quiet round here.  I find myself missing him sometimes when one or the other of us goes on an errand.  Hope he comes back soon.  Its almost lunch time and I despise eating alone.  Come to think of it, I guess I loathe doing anything alone.  Probably stems from George and I being inseperable from the day we were born.  Even sleeping in the same bed till we were about 14.  Mum never appreciated it, but I'm not sure she understood.  Not sure she understands now.  Always mussing about finding a nice girl and settling down.  What if I don't want a girl.  What if I like things the way they are.  Suppose eventually George'll find a nice girl to settle down with, but I know I never will.  

The only thing we've never talked about is probably the thing that should've been discussed a long time ago.  Too late now I suppose.  Atleast I'm a good enough actor to still be the Fred everyone expects.  Joking, immature, rowdy Fred.  When really, I'm just sad, scared and alone Fred.

<b>[/private]</b>

Suppose I'll go upstairs and prepare lunch for George.  He should be home soon, and we've got some new items to stock on the shelves.  Not to mention some more testing to do.  Don't be alarmed if you see smoke billowing from the windows.  Just means we've got some good things comming."

"event","Suppose you've already heard from George that we've got a computer now in the shop.  For ordering and keeping track of money and stuff.  More trouble than help I say.Its amazing the sort of thing you can find without even looking for them, but when you want something, you can never get it.  

These journals have some promise though.  George and I are eager to keep up with what our ittle ronnie is doing.  Making sure he's behaving and all.  Wouldn't want to have to tell mum he's taking after his brothers.  Reckon she'd just die.

Buisness is going great, and if anyone wants to come help test out some new products, I've got some pumpkin pasties that blew up this morning, and I'm not quite sure what they do now.  Should be fun to check out the results though."

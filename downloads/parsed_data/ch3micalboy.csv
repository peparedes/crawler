I&nbsp;START&nbsp;SCHOOL&nbsp;TOMORROW. I've only been wanting to go to Toni and Guy for the past 3 years, it doesn't seem real. I've been talking about going there since October, and now it's finally happening... FINALLY.

Tomorrow is just orientation, and Tuesday is my first day. Wooooo.

I'll be working atleast 20 hours a week on top of that, which isn't that bad, but it makes for a long day. Tuesday-Saturday, 8-4, work 4:30-close(9:20) a couple days a week. The next year I should be a ball of sunshine... With fabulous hair.

The loan business went through, and I&nbsp;don't have to pay an exorbent amount of money to pay it back either.&nbsp; The sallie mae shit that the school uses got back to me with 14%. For an 18,000 loan that would be 40,000 I'd pay back. My mom got one for 3%. Which is only 20,000. I know it sounds retarded to say &quot;ONLY&quot; twentythousanddollars, but it's a way better &quot;price&quot; than 14%. I'd rather not start my life off in the red.&nbsp; The only thing is that I'm not deferring it, but that's ok, atleast I have a job through these &quot;rough economic times&quot;.

Which I haven't experienced at all, besides work being absolutely dead on week nights and a Quizno's across the street closing. :'(.&nbsp; My mom is working crazy hours because the mortgage rates are so extremely low everyone and their dog is refinancing. And stores are having completely outrageous sales giving me adorable new outfits... I swear if I didn't watch the news, everything would seem somewhat normal. 

My question to anyone that reads this, has your life changed in anyway (better or worse) because of the slow economy? Were you trying to find a job but can't, laid off, new outfits? Lemme know!

"event","Hm... What to say besides school and work? Nothing wicked exciting. I graduate in two weeks with an assciociates degree in <strike>nothing.</strike>. I mean, General Studies. <br /><br />My classes this semester haven't been overly stimulating, besides Drugs and Human Behavior, I'm not a human services major, but it was the only 4 credit elective. Had to go to Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and end with a treatment plan presentation for addicts of drugs. My school friend Nick and I chose methamphetimine and it turned out to be a 25 minute presentation.<br /><br />Intro to Business is reminds me of playing MMORPGS, as I just stare at the screen and watch a over weight 40 year old exclaim that he knows more than everyone else. It's pretty much a grind-a-thon about stocks and entrepeneurs, which is pretty good general knowledge to have I guess.<br /><br />Marriage and Family... Statistics about divorce, too many gender roles are emphasised. So... what if I'm not one of those, &quot;oh my god here they come makin' noise&quot; gay guys, and I marry the same type? Are we screwed because we cannot use effective communication to make appropriate descicions? Lame.<br /><br />Astronomy is fun besides the math, I like the concepts behind everything, and it's totally cute when I&nbsp;was showing Sean constellations.<br /><br />Other class was Short Stories, I got an A, and it was pretty fun. Not too much to report on, but if you need a lit credit, take it with Rene' Anderson.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Everything is all set for me to go to Toni and Guy. I start January 7th. I almost feel like I've wasted the last 2 and half years at CCRI, but it can only be for the better. When I graduate from Tigi, I&nbsp;can only hope I'm one step ahead of everyone else that went right after highschool.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I got a raise at Bob's for my year anniversary, and get paid decently for any part time employee in a clothing store. I have another 25 cent raise coming up if I can stop being so damn ditzy. (Not gonna happen.)<br /><br />--<br /><br />Thats about it, I'm not too worried about finals, as I've been paying attention and generally appriciate the information my professors spit at me. I have 4 finals, 1 make up test, and 1 final project, oh... and 1 Math test to finish that I've been procrastinating for literally a year..<br /><br />--<br /><br />My mom got a pace maker put in and I've been trying my best to take care of her when I'm around. I'm not too worried as she's a tough bitch. :)<br /><br />--<br /><br />I've been pretty lonely until recently. Ofcoarse I have my work friends, and we all hang out every Saturday, but without a boyfriend and a best hag (Who hasn't actually been a best hag in 6 months, sadly) I really don't have anyone to talk to.&nbsp; But I've been getting more work done.<br /><br />--<br /><br />PS Thanks to a certain couple of people from politely excusing themselves from my life. It was lovely being literally friendless for two months.&nbsp; I'm still here if you would like to talk or something, but I'm almost positive you guys won't take me up on that.<br /><br />Sorry my spelling and grammar is horrid.<br /><br />"

I'm sick of this summer. It's been a rollercoaster. 

August 15 is my 6th month anniversary with Joseph.

I'm probably not going to see him on that day because my schedule conflicts with his. He's moving into his apartment off campus, and while I'm worried, I think it'll be better for him. As in, balancing a part time job (That isn't 6 hours a week like Starbucks gave him) and spending money wisely. 

Not that I am one to talk about spending money stupidly. 40$ color and cut, + shampoo and conditioner + product = this blond better stay this time.

So yeah, I'm all set to graduate after this semester. I'm taking 5 classes which is a big step for me, because I've only been taking 4 and slacking in one. Should be all easy/interesting.

Short Stories in Literature
Intro to Business
AstronomyLAB
Drugs and Human Behavior
Marriage and Family (Some sociology course)

Last couple of days of school (Tuesday, Wednesday.). I need to finish MathLab super cereal. I did pretty well in all my other classes. I'm taking a summer class too.

Working a lot more. 25+ Hours a week and usually a 5+ hour Sunday shift. Sup time and a half. Raise for service desk should kick in soon, also, a raise for my 1 year anniversary. I'm freakishly awesome at Bob's. 

I wish I had more time to hang out with friends, perhaps even more friends that I see outside of school work. Pretty much it's Joe and Amanda. Haven't actually hung out with Emily in forever. Nor Rabia, I guess I cut those ties, which is retarded because pot shouldn't be the thing holding friendships together. 

Um.. I have a lovely boyfriend. We got married a couple weeks ago. The ""minister"" was taking shots of jaeger all night, and I had my fill of gin. There's no ring on my finger, so I don't believed&nbsp; it happened. 

Well. That's about it. Plus Final Fantasy XI when I have the 3+ hours to do anything. I'm getting slightly less invites on my 53Warrior. I want to wear my AF gloves dammit.

"event","So I pretty much got some white trash kid fired at Bob's. 

He was doing the stereotypical gayboy voice, and I was nearby cleaning up the store... 

Me: ""Um, would you mind not doing that? It's kinda insulting.""
Him: ""Why cuz you're a fag?! (As he lols to his friends.)
Me: ""Yeah... You can't say that to people to work with.""

As I went and told a manager. It's not like it bothered me too much. 

Zero tolerance policies ftw."

"event","so i just went to this temp agency, did a typing test (78wpm) that they were really impressed with, that's good? I thought everyone typed that fast...? Anyway, I got a 2nd job basically telemarketing for field research. I don't really care at this point though, I need the money for Franklin Pierce in the fall.

Still at Bob's, still going nowhere. I'm pretty much all done with CCRI.

"event","Thanksgiving was lame. Me, my mom, my brother, his girlfriend. I drank wine and then played FFXI (And by played, I mean stood in the same place for an hour waiting for a mob to pop), and then went to my dads.

LAME. I surrived black friday. Bobs was fucking ridiculous busy, but I made fun of it just talking to customers about anything, and being extra nice. Being nice makes the time go by faster for some reason. So that was 7-1.

Came home. Did nothing for a little bit and napped until I had to go to Gamestop at 5, til 10. That was ALSO mad busy, but all I had to do was talk to people about games. Or something. I had to do PSA's which basically is screaming our sales as loud as I can to customers. ""All used games buy 2 get 1 free, yo!"" 

Ahhhh. I surrived. And all I want is pot now."

"event","Jobs: Alright. Bob's is putting me other places than cashier. And hopefully they are giving me more hours than 15 a week. I don't have any hours at Gamestop. 0. None. Aren't I supposed to, ya know... ""work"" there? Atleast give me a friggin' day. I've only worked there twice, I don't know if I've made a good enough impression. It's a little awkward to walk up to people, stick my penis in their throat, and then ask them to pre-order Call of Duty 4 or Assassin's Creed.

School: Getting a little hectic as of right now. I'm just glad I'm not working a whole lot of hours right now so I can catch up on some stuff. Photography is making me poor. (30$ for a package of paper? And 35 bucks for filters... basically colored plastic!!) But it's a class I find fufilling. I don't know, I guess college is supposed to be fufilling and ""life enriching""? I've just had the mind set of just getting by.

Friends: Yeah there's like only 4 people I talk to on a regular basis. Love them all to pieces. Haven't talked to Johnny or Jimmy in a while. Meh.

Love life: Haven't talked to Jon since we broke up, besides him texting me saying that he saw me in traffic and it made him feel bad. Hah! Good. He doesn't matter. Waste of 7 months, I say. No other boys in my horizon, except Ryan. But he's a little... off. Heavily medicated faggo's, Mike doesn't do.

"event","Metroid Prime 3 is the most perfect game I've ever played. I know I say this a lot now, but I guess games just keep getting better. Or I don't play bad ones. Whichever.

The controls are fantastic, I never want to touch a right analog stick to aim ever again. They are that good. The environmental puzzles are hard and give you that, ""Oh I'm so fuckin dumb."" feel. 

There's some backtracking, but not as much as the other Prime games. Everything's streamlined and put in the right area at the right time. Plus the game is fucking amazing looking. 

I'm only 40% through and I don't want it to end."

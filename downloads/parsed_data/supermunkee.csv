There are some crazy-ass talented people out there.  I was just tooling around on YouTube, checking out Rockband 2 videos.  Some people are either way too devoted to playing this game or, more likely, already play their respective instruments and therefore already have the required skill to play this well.

For my part, I could hardly follow the notes as they blazed by in a dizzying display of technicolor befitting an LSD high.

Behold, Rockband 2 gods:

Smooth Criminal, Expert, 100%, on drums:

I had figured that everyone over 5 years old had seen the Star Wars trilogy.  Apparently, there is one girl who hasn't seen any of the original 3 movies.  Without having seen the movies, she was able to piece together the plot from bits and pieces of pop-culture reference that have ingrained themselves on the global psyche.

Behold!  I made a new doublet for this year's Faire.  I'm unsure about it.  Technically, I think it turned out well.  The assembly is good, and I do like the fabric a lot.  On the other hand, I'm not used to wearing clothes that fit, so it feels a little tight.  I don't know yet if I really love my doublet.  Meredith and I were debating whether or not I should wear it with my shirt tucked or untucked.  I prefer untucked but she prefers tucked.

I will leave you with two photos.  I'll let you decide.

"event","Hiya, monkey!<br /><br />So last week I got the opportunity to go to Las Vegas to attend the National Association of Broadcasters convention, also known as NAB.  Yeah, I know, it sounds pretty geeky.  Broadcasters?  Yes, there were plenty of hardcore engineering things there, such as FM towers, signal tuners, helicopters with gyro-controlled cameras.  But that was just the North Hall.<br /><br />NAB is one of the top five conventions to grace the Las Vegas Convention Center.  When NAB comes to town, nothing else happens at the convention center because it takes up the entire place.  Yeah, it's that big.  All the big players were there: Sony, Canon, and Panasonic, among others.  Adobe, Apple, and Avid were also on hand to demonstrate their new offerings.<br /><br />Needless to say, the place was like geek heaven.  It had the latest in audio-visual technology, plus all the booth babes you could want.  Who was I to say no, especially since the tax-payers were paying for it all?  At any rate, I walked many many miles and took plenty of photos while I was in Vegas.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Click the cut to see the photos!"">We stayed at the Excalibur Hotel and Casino<br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://photobucket.com""><img border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket"" src=""http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a380/supermonkee/Vegas2007/excaliber.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />Egyptian hieroglyphs, next to modern architecture, reflecting a medieval a castle.

I've seen a bunch of commercials for this new movie coming out soon, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481369/"">The Number 23</a>.  In the commercial, one of the characters quotes the following: ""2 divided by 3 is 666, the number of the Devil.""

2 divided by 3 is .66666666(repeated forever).  If you round to 3 decimal places, the 3rd 6 is rounded up (the fourth 6 is greater than 5).  So, 2 divided by 3 is .667.  667, as far as I'm aware, is not a very scary number.

So there.  Everyone beware the great, evil 667!

In other news, we learned tonight that rickety bridges tend to be very effective at killing Mere's D&D characters.  She lost a second one tonight.  Ok, so technically the fighter survived the fall to the river below, and was swept away never to be seen again.  But I still say it was the fall that killed him.  We mourned the loss of the fighter for about 5 minutes, then we met another fighter that bore a striking resemblance to the first one.  Hey, when you lose a new character in the first encounter of a mission, he tends to get resurrected right away.

That is all for now.  You may return to your normal activities.

So I finally got Mere to agree to try camping, and she loved it.  I'm glad she had a good time, and I'm excited that she's been bitten by the camping bug.  Either that or it was an insect of some kind.  We'll see when the swelling goes down.

I've been pouring over my pictures and at the same time crying over my poor camera's destruction.   I found out the hard way that you shouldn't leave a camera unattended near a fire.  Even more so when it's windy.

I set my camera down on my camp chair and went to answer nature's call.  While I was gone, a gust of wind blew my chair into the fire, and my camera took a nose-dive right into the flames.  Part of my lens melted but the camera body escaped relatively unscathed.  I suspect the heat may have caused some sensor damage.  I'm going to run some tests this weekend to find out for sure.  Either way, the lens is no longer sealed and is effectively destroyed. :-(

I did manage to grab a couple nice photos from the trip, despite my, um, photographic challenges.  Enjoy these:

Yes, mood swings.  Pregnant women apparently get very fussy.  But it's ok, we love them anyway because they are the most beautiful, wonderful, intelligent, caring...um...wonderful...people ever.  Yeah, something like that.

So, when approaching a pregnant woman, it is best to avoid contact at all costs.  Go ahead, roll your ""Move Silently"" check.

""Move Silently"" check?  Yes, that's a D&D reference.  I've finally started playing D&D again, and I'm quite chuffed about it.  Apparently Dicea was interested in learning how to play, so she and Mere went out and bought the new, 3.5 edition Player's Handbook (Mere also picked up the Monster Manual and DM's Guide).  Mere and I have been trading DM duties back and forth while Dicea has been learning the ins and outs of role-playing and rolling for initiative.

I hope Dicea is enjoying it, because I'm having an absolute blast.  It's been far too long since I've felt the sensation of polyhedral dice!  Gotta go finish preparing for the adventure tomorrow.  We'll see if Bob the Fighter and Eve the Wizard can manage to help their fellow adventurers solve and important riddle.

Christmas was good this year.  Meredith got me a Lego Star Destroyer complete with Lego Imperial folks.  I now have a beautiful Darth Vader in all of his plastic glory.  Fear the Lego Darth!

Other fine gifts include: an ice-cream maker attachment for my Kitchenaid, a nice set of mixing bowls, dinosaur cookie cutters, a couple of movies and other assorted presents.

Now it's time to take down the tree and have that feeling of empty space because my mind has grown accustom to seeing all the decorations.

Elsewhere in the news, Former President Ford Died.  In recognition of Ford's life, current wannabe-President Bush declared Tuesday, January 2, as a national day of mourning.  Bush ordered all federal institutions to be closed.  Theoretically, this includes NASA, since NASA is a federal institution.  Theoretically.

All NASA employees get the day off.  NASA is closed, and they are excused from work.  Contractors, however, must follow their particular company's policy.  Pretty much all of the contractors at NASA have followed suit, and excused their employees from work.  After all, NASA folks won't be there, and there won't be much to do.  My company, on the other hand, will not observe the national day of mourning, and has ordered all employees to report to work as usual.

Here's how it works:  NASA will be closed, per the President's order.  Technically, though, NASA has to remain open to allow for a skeleton crew to support mission activities.  Somebody has to run the Space Station (that would be the Mission Control folks who get paid big money to be on console during weekends and holidays in the first place).  Since NASA is technically open, our company's president decided that we will have to be at work to support our customer (remember, our customer was just excused from work that day).  Oh, she did say that we could take a few moments to reflect on the life and times of President Ford.

I swear, my company will stop at nothing to screw its employees.

I'm going to be sick on Tuesday.  I'm developing a case of Idon'tgiveashit.

So the 21st century has turned out a lot different than I had imagined so many years ago.

Let's see:  I am married <i>(never saw that one coming)</i>, I work at NASA doing photo stuff <i>(never really thought that would happen)</i>, <a href=""http://www.dogster.com/?437046"">my dog has a better website than me</a> <i>(honestly, never saw that one coming)</i>, and I'm about to become a father <i>(yeah, you read that right)</i>.

So the day before we left for Thanksgiving in Lubbock, Meredith called me on my way home from work.  She told me that I needed to cancel my appointment with the fertility doctor.  Of course, my first thought was, ""oh no, Mere's been fired and we have no insurance!""

Well, I got home and was greeted with a positive pregnancy test.  And I've been told it's the most positive a test can ever get.  My sister (who has become a sort of expert on all things conception) had trouble distinguishing the control line with the indicator line.  It was <i>that</i> pink.

We had our second official ultrasound today.  This is my spot:
<a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a380/supermonkee/Preggo/12-8-20061.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

I've added a few embellishments to aid the fellow men out there that don't know a yolk sack from an embryo.  I managed to sweet talk the nurse into giving us the ultrasound digitally, so we have the pictures and some short videos on CD.  OK, so there wasn't much sweet talking, I just asked politely.

So there you have it.  I'm going to be a father.  I'm still a bit shell-shocked by the whole thing.  I honestly never saw myself having kids.  I'm very selfish when it comes to my time and my freedoms, and I really don't like having people depend on me.  That said, I am very happy for this chance, and I can say that I'll to everything I can to give this child everything it deserves.

Stay tuned for the Curious George nursery.  There will be murals.  Oh yes, there will be murals.

And no, he/she will not get to play with my Lego collection.  He/she will have to get his/her own Lego sets.  So there.

So I think I'm becoming an official Rennie.  Yes, we went back to the Renaissance Festival this weekend.  Meredith chose to wear her outfit from 2 years ago and I, geting tired of the kilt and hating my shirt, decided to fashion a new outfit.  Meredith didn't want to wear her shirt because it gets too hot.  She threw on a tank-top under the corset and looked the part.  For my new outfit I bought a ""Robin-Hood-esque"" pattern because it had some pants that I liked.  I normally make all of my clothing large.  After I made the pants, but they just didn't fit well.  I got frustrated and put on my pajamas for the night.  I love my pj pants.  So I whipped out the pattern from years ago and made myself some pants.  They are awesome.  I modified the design to include drawstrings on the pantleg.  This will allow me to pull them up to knee-length if need be.  Hancock was selling the Butterick patterns for 99 cents, so we bought some of those.  I picked up a really nice Renaissance-type shirt.

After a few yards of linen, I ended up with the first 2 parts of my official Ren Fest outfit: Shirt and Pants.

When we got to the Faire, I hunted around and managed to find a really good ring belt.  Part two of the costume.  There are two main parts of the outfit left: Boots and Gloves.  Boots are pricey, so that'll wait for a little bit.  Once I save a little money I'll pick them up in the offseason, when they're a little cheaper.

Here's a look at us this weekend.

"event","Yeah yeah...long time and all that, eh monkey?  sit back and grab some tea, this is a long-ish post.

So what's been going on lately?  Here's the long and short of it (mostly short):

I'm getting a promotion at work.  It's 99% a done deal, but there's that little 1% of ""you never know"" that always sits on the outer fringe.  If all goes according to plan - which it should, 99% - I'll finally be leaving Configuration Management.  I will be moving into the Space Station Imagery Group.  Basically, this group manages the imagery requirements for the ISS, and is responsible for a number of other imagery-related things.  Yes, that's right.  After almost 6 years, I finally get to apply my degree and do what I love to do.  Go me!

The move is bittersweet, though.  I've grown fond of my coworkers.  In a job that I never really grew to like, I could always count on their friendship, and we always had a great time chatting it up in the cube.  My boss is also the best boss I've ever had.  She had a hand in getting me my promotion, so I can't thank her enough for all of her trust and support over the last couple of years.  She's helped me trememdously.

So that's the news on the job front.  Elsewhere life is moving along.  Since we had the foundation repaired and the A/C replaced, I was hoping that big projects were done for a while.  Well, they always come in threes, don't they?  We just got through some tropical depression weather, and during the monsoon I went into the attic to investigate a tapping sound.  The rotting plywood and dripping water told me that the 20-year-old roof needs to be replaced.  *sigh*

The good news is that the foundation repair is almost paid off.  The A/C bill on the credit card has come way down as well, so our bills really aren't too bad.  The further good news is that the leaky roof is actually not leaking that bad, and it can wait until next spring, or longer.

Last, but not least, we went to the <a href=""http://www.texrenfest.com/"">Texas Renaissance Festival</a> last weekend.  The Texas Ren Fest is one of the largest renaissance festivals in the US, and if you've never been, you absolutely must go.  Of course, dressing up is not required, but where's the fun in wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt?  In accordance with the mandate set forth in my offical Geek Platinum card, I was one of ""those people"" and dressed up for Ren Fest.  I wore my standard garb: Kilt, shirt and cloak with a sword at my side.  This year I dug out my old walking stick and it complimented my garb very well.  Meredith creted a new character this year: An Autumn Wood Nymph.  As usual I made every piece of our costumes, except the shoes.  I just don't have the right supplies for that.  We are going again on Halloween weekend.  Meredith will wear her green dress from last year and I am making some new clothes to wear.  Here are some pictures from last weekend (taken in our back yard):

So, it's been a while since I last posted.  Apparently, the last time I posted, Tropical Storm Chris was aiming his eye in our general direction.  I really thought that would be the one.  It would be poetic, in a way.  Alas, it was not to be and Tropical Storm Chris fizzled out, not making any real headlines.  That also fits very well.

Well, here I am however many days later and <a href=""http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/"">Tropical Storm Ernesto</a> is the next threat in line.  Will he make it?  Will Ernesto amount to full-fledged hurricane status and make headlines?  Will we be spending 4 days sleeping in a 4 bedroom house with 8 adults, 2 children, 2 infants, 4 dogs, 4 cats, and dozens of birds?  God I hope not.

Only time will tell.  I wouldn't mind a nice, low Category 3.  Enough to stay home from work, possibly enough to get a roof replacement courtesy of our homeowner's insurance, but not enough to remove the trees from my yard.  Well, maybe just the front pine tree; I was going to cut that one down anyway.  As long as we don't have to evacuate, I'm good with whatever spins our way.

Oh, and watch the television Sunday afternoon.  Space Shuttle Atlantis will launch at approximately 3:34pm (Central) to start the Flight 12A/STS-115 mission!  This mission will mark the first Space Station assembly flight since the Columbia accident (Flight 12<b>A</b> indicates the 12th Assembly flight).  Very exciting stuff is ahead, and the Space Station will be one major piece closer to its final configuration.  You can catch all kinds of mission facts and video at <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov"">www.NASA.gov</a>.

No, not the kind that lets light into your house.  I rather like those.  No, I'm talking about Microsoft Windows.  I'm almost reqady to ditch Windows and its DRM-littered, standards-breaking, evil empire operating system.  I've decided to join the Open Source movement.

For my initial steps into Open Source computing, I've decided upon the <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/"">Ubuntu</a> version of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux"">Linux</a>.

I have to say my first impression is a good one.  Ubuntu is very stable (though, to be fair I never had stability problems with Windows).  There are a few things that take some getting used to.  Installing programs is not as easy as Windows.  I'm used to popping in a CD and installing a program.  In Linux, installing programs and configuring settings is a bit more involved. Once you get used to the process, things move along well enough.

I've always said that Linux is not suited for the general user.  Ubuntu proved me wrong.  If all you want to do is check e-mail, surf the web and do generic office tasks (word processing, spreadsheets, etc), then Ubuntu is perfect.  It comes preinstalled with the proper programs (no more Microsoft Office - YAY).  All you do is click and go.

The two things that hold Linux back from being more widely recognized are hardware and software support.  To be fair, this is really up to the hardware manufacturers and software developers.  Unfortunately, instead of working with a single set of open standards, Microsoft and Apple both work under proprietary systems.  As a result, hardware and software companies create their products so that they work on the desired platform.  Furthermore, since Microsoft has engrained itself in 98% of the world's machines, you're hard pressed to find stuff that works on any platform.  Most software companies choose not to spend the money to write software that runs on 3 different platforms.  Instead, they shoot for the most widely used operating system:  Windows.

There are some utilities that allow you to run Windows programs on Macs and in Linux, but the utilities are hit and miss.  This is precisely why I am keeping Windows: Games and image editing.  I have configured my computer to dual-boot.  If I'm going to play a game or edit images, I'll boot up Windows.  I'f I'm doing anything else, I'll use Linux.

So that's my story, by golly.  And I'm sticking to it!

"event","You want news, Monkey?  You want drama? Well, here's some news at least.

We went to a Houston Astros baseball game two weekends ago.  I now remember why I hate watching baseball.  The home team won and everyone was happy, or drunk, or both.  I smiled and just had a good time hanging out.  Later that night I started to get queasy.  It turns out that the wonderful Minute Maid Stadium hamburger gave me slight food poisoning.  Also, my Sprite was flat despite the continual objections to the contrary by the guy working the stand.

Moral of the story: If you want to hang out with friends, go to a hockey game or have a party at home.  Baseball games are far too boring to hang out.

Monday night I went to bed feeling completely normal.  I woke up at about 3:00 am, ran to the bathroom and vomited.  I seem to have been stricken with the flu.  In May.  OK, so maybe the hamburger didn't give me food poisoning, but I suspect it did, and that my immune system was weakened.  I'm practically made of iron, but if you chip my resilient outer coating, the inside can rust.  And when I get sick, I fall hard.  I was out Tuesday and Wednesday.  I had already planned to take Friday off due to a wedding on Saturday.  I went on-line to check my time and it turns out that I have far less vacation time than I thought.  After Wednesday I had negative 6 hours of vacation.  So I went to work on Thursday.  I was feeling better, but still felt like crap.  Friday I was well enough to ride in the car to Denton, TX for the wedding.  I am just fine now.

Moral of the story: I don't like getting sick.  If it's strong enough to make me sick, it will put you in the hospital.

(Continued from above) On Saturday we went to a wedding.  One of Meredith's friends got married at the Texas Women's University campus.  The ceremony was short, but sweet.  The reception was very nice.  I was going to take some pictures, but when I turned on my camera I realized that I had left my memory card here in Houston.  Yes, I have a degree in photography.

Moral of the story: I am a moron.

One final piece of ""ain't that cool"" news.  This year I am going to get the coolest birthday present ever.  The scheduled launch of STS-121 (Flight ULF1.1) is July 1.  Go me.

That's all I feel like typing right now.  It's been a long day and I just want to sit back, relax, and play some games.

Meredith and I had a date the other night.  On Tuesday we went to the movie theater and saw Curious George.  I have to say it far exceeded my expectations.  Curious George has a new plot, but draws from the books for many of the events during the story.  Since I'm a huge fan, I had low expectations; I figured Hollywood would kill the innocent friendliness with typical sophomoric humor.  I was pleasantly surprised to find absolutely no questionable content.  This truly is a kid's movie.  Not a kid's movie in the way that Toy Story was a kid's movie (animated characters telling adult jokes).  Curious George was presented completely for the kids.

And here's the kicker.  It appeals to adults as well.  It doesn't rely on inside jokes to ge thte adults to laugh.  Adults will laugh because the situations are timeless, and the jokes are honestly funny.  The situations throughout the movie were genuine, but they did not rely on over the top violence or scary moments.

So that was Curious George.  The only disappointing thing about it is the fact that it was too underhyped.  For the quality movie it was, it should have received more press.  We are definitely buying that movie when it comes out on video.

In other news, we had to buy a new clothes dryer today.  I think our old one finally got tired of living, and last night it just died.  Meredith and I went to Lowe's today and bought the dryer that goes with the washer we bought not too long ago.  It will arrive tomorrow.  Yay.

That's about it.  Not much else that I feel like writing down at the moment.

I hate being sick.  I don't often get sick, but when I do it usually hits me hard.  Somehow, I managed to catch a cold 2 weeks ago.  Usually, these things are so minor that I hardly give them notice.  It will run its course and after a day of rest I'll be back to normal.  This one pesisted.  I don't think this particular cold bug would pass a doping test at the Olympics.

So the cold continued on.  After a few days, I started to feel better.  Then WHAM, it hit me again.  This time, I started feeling run down, and my sinus ached, and I was stuffed up something fierce.  Ok, now it's time to fire back.  Out comes the nighttime, aching, sneezy stuffyhead, whatever medicine, along with its daytime kin.  A few more days go by and I beign to realize that I siginificantly underestimated the tenacity of this particular bug.  I think it brought along a few of its relatives, and they were now shopping for real estate.

When my phlegm started turning a pretty shade of orange, I decided to do the unthinkable.  I went to the doctor.  It is almost unheard of for me to go to the doctor.  To give you an idea, it had been so long since my last visit that I was deleted from their system.  The doctor's office to which I had been going since I was knee-high, I had to enroll as a new patient.  Oh, the joy.

I was seen in record time (I think I'll always go as a new patient) and my self-diagnosis turned out to be spot on: sinusitis.  I got a presciption antibiotic, as well as a prescription decongestant, and was well on my way to recovery.

I spent the weekend sitting on the couch watching the US Women's Hockey Team kick ass in their Olympic opener, blowing my nose, and being generally miserable.  A week later I am feeling back to normal, but the US Women's Hockey Team lost to Sweden after an unusually sloppy game.

Now they'll play against Finland on Monday for the Bronze medal, which still is quite admirable.  It's more than I can say for the men.

Consider this the obligatory annoucement that I need to update more often.

So not a whole lot has happened since my last post.  Life is just trudging along at the speed of life, and things are about where they were a month ago.  Meredith and I are now trying to have a child.  Yes, the thought of me bringing offspring into the world scares me too.  But hey, it's man's primal urge to procreate, so whatcha gonna do.

Last weekend Meredith and I went with her mom to the Houston Museum of Natural Science and History to see the new Imax movie, ""<a href=""http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/rovingmars/"">Roving Mars</a>.""  It was very neat to learn abou the other projects that are happening at NASA.  The movie was very well made, and was very informative.  We got to see a special screening for NASA employees at a discouted ticket price, which only added to the ""cool"" factor.  After the movie, we ate some lunch at the McDonalds in the museum and headed over to the <a href=""http://www.hmns.org/exhibits/special_exhibits/diana.asp?r=1"">Princess Diana exhibit</a> (which we saw at a discout with our NASA badges).  Ir you're into the Royal Family or Diana, then the exhibit was worth it.  I am not into either of those things, so it didn't have much of an effect on me.  It did have some interesting stuff, but overall I would say it was not worth the standard ticket price.  Only go if you can get a discount.

Today Meredith and I headed over to my parents' house for a family get together.  My niece celebrated her 2nd birthday today, so we ate lots of food and had the traditional ice cream cake from Baskin Robins.  Later in the evening, we watched one of my favorite movies, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin.""  It is over the top, with lots of seemingly gratuitous sophomoric humor, but the overall effect is non-stop laughter.

So, what else is going on?  Let me think...

Ah, I am starting a somewhat new position at work.  The Space Station Manifest group has been having some problems recently getting all of their documentation in order, so the powers that be have decided that I will now be the Configuration Management Specialist for the Manifest Team.  Essentially, my job is to provide a quality check layer to the CM process for the Manifest folks.  It's not exactly a glory job, but I can't really complain either.  For some reason everyone has a hard time dealing with the Manifest process.  I personally don't think it's that difficult.  The other reason my boss volunteered me for this job is because it will set me up to move out of CM and into the Manfiest group.  Or, if I so desire, I could move into one of the other groups.  If I could work in the Imagery group, that would be keen, because then I would stand a better chance of transitioning into the actual Imagery side of things.  Of course, all that could very well happen, but it will happen later down the road.  I am happy enough where I am, and I'll continue to try to do a good job.

So there's a down and dirty update on a few of the boring things going on in our little world.  I still haven't won the lottery, so it looks like I'll have to go to work on Monday.  Though, I did recently decide to start investing some money in the Stock Market.  If I make it big you're all invited to a party at our new house, and drinks are on me.

Yeah ok, so make it one of my New Year's resolutions.  I will update more often this year.  Now, let's see if I actually hold to this resolution as well as I did the ""get in better shape"" resolution from last year.  ;-)

According to the old wive's tale, whatever you are doing when you ring in the new year is a symbol of what you will be doing the rest of the year to come.  This year we rang in the new year with a funeral.  Let's hope it's just an old wive's tale and not the gospel truth!

Meredith's aunt passed away right after Christmas, so we drove up to Oklahoma for the funeral this past weekend.  The funeral was nice.  It was nice to see friends and family.  It's nice to be back home.  The visits are good, but the drive kills me every time.

Christmas was very good this year.  I got a bunch of good stuff.  Meredith got me a really nice scroll saw for my woodworking, which would have come in handy while I was building this:

<img src=""http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a380/supermonkee/General/RockingHorse.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

This was the big secret.  This is why Meredith was banned from the garage for the last couple of months.  I built her this rocking horse to symbolise that I am ready to have children.  The project was long and somewhat challenging at times, but the reaction alone was worth it.

Oy.  I'm tired now, so I am going to unwind by killing things on the computer, then head off to bed.  Thank goodness I'm off tomorrow.  I need the sleep.

I put up the Christmas lights on our house today.  I also hung our wreath next to the upstairs window.  The lights I'm using were handed down to us from Meredith's mom.  They are fairly old, and are starting to show their age.  I think next year I'm going to buy icicle lights for the house.  I like icicle lights better than standard multicolor anyway.  Bottom line: The house is now festive for the season.

We bought an artificial Christmas tree.  I'm a traditional kind of guy, and I love the smell of a real tree; but, Meredith prefers the fake ones and they are less hassle, so I gave in.  The tree is up and the lights have been applied.  Since I agreed to the fake tree, I made the stipulation that it could not be pre-lit.  If the tree is fake, I at least will get the experience of putting on the lights.  Like I said, I'm a traditional kind of guy.  Apparently the current ""in thing"" is to have a pre-lit tree, so it's nigh impossible to find a fake tree that is not pre-lit.  We finally found the one place around here that has them.  Bottom line: Tree is up, lights are on and it looks very nice.

We got the movie ""Kingdom of Heaven"" from Netflicks the other day.  I don't know who gave the green light to this horrid, ungodly waste of time, but solitary confinement would be letting them off easy.  It had so much potential, being an epic period piece about the crusades with a great cast.  Unfortunately that's where it ended.  The writing was contived and the directing was atrocious.  Thanks to Ridley Scott, gratuitous gore abounds.  It was so bad that I actually slept through the climactic siege of Jerusalem.  It's been a day since I saw the movie, and I still have no idea what was going on.  Bottom line:  The script is not even fit to line the bottom of a bird cage.

So there.  Happenings in a nutshell.  Bottom line: It's time for bed.

"event","We saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire yesterday.  It was pretty good.  Definitely the best of the series so far.  And now for my quasi-full review...

I thought it was the best of the 4. Meredith and I are very big fans of the books, so we've been watching the movies with a very close eye.

Chris Columbus made the mistake in #1 of being slavishly devoted to every written word of the book and the movie's pacing ended up being way too fast. The cast was very young and, as a result, the acting was good enough for a kids movie (barring Alan Rickman - nailed Snape dead on). #2 is the weakest of the books, so it's only fitting that it was the weakest of the movies. Acting was marginally better, but still an improvement. When Alfonso Cuaron took over for #3, the series took a good turn. The transition to the darker story was pulled off very well, and the kids' acting was noticably better. Once again, the adults were all very good, and Gary Oldman and David Thewlis were spot on as Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, respectively. The score and production design were befitting with story's overall dark tone.

Which brings us to #4. Again, the actors are improving with age, and Mike Newell (the newest director in the lot) took the dark thematic elements from #3 and ran with them. #4 was completely different than the previous 3. This was the first time that, when watching the movie, I was able to visualize the characters as normal kids at school. They weren't just a bunch of wizards waving their wands around. As the kids have grown, so too have the issues with which they battle throughout the year. Raging hormones, best friends fighting, and the emotions that jealousy and competition can bring out in a kid were all portrayed very well. There was enough sexual innuendo that we were able to see that the kids are now dealing with sex as any 14 year-old would, but it was subdued enough that it never seemd gratuitous.

I was still upset that Snape's character is being underutilized. He is a VERY important character in the books, and the casual viewing audience needs to start connecting with him more. I wish Newell had gone into more detail with Mad-Eye Moody. The big revealing at the end of the movie seemed a little too rushed for my taste, but it was starting to run long on time. Also, Rita Skeeter's character and storyline were underplayed. Rita's sensationalist news stories were one of the reasons for the conflict between Harry and Ron, but it was never really apparent.

Overall it could have been better (but then, what movie can't be better?). It was still the best of the 4. Newell did a pretty good job of weeding out the unnecessary material while keeping the story intact.

And Ralph Fiennes is one heckuva dark lord. I'm really looking forward to #5 (Order of the Pheonix). #5 is my favorite of the books, so I really hope David Yates is up to the task. It's a big book, and just about every page is relevant in one way or another.

Yes, yes it is.  I've put us on a fairly tight budget in order to get the credit card paid off in a couple months.  We have quite a bit on the card from Meredith's hospital visit a while back, and I'd like to get it paid off.  So now that we finally have everything going in a good direction, the house decided that it needed to drain even more money from me.

Enter the cracks.  Yes, our walls have a few cracks.  There is a sizeable crack extending from the top corner of the front door, but that was caused a while back when the door was sticking.  The pressure on the doorframe cause a crack to develope, and I never did get around to patching it.  I fixed the door and the crack hasn't moved, which is a good thing.  There is a rather large, very straight crack that runs from the celing down to the doorbell (the unit on the wall that actually rings), and from there it wanders down to the picture on the wall.  I was concerned that it was going to end up being a foundation problem, but my dad came over and had a look.  He was able to rule out foundation problems, and after we peeled back the opening in the seem, we determined that two sheets of drywall separated during the initial house settling, and instead of reparing it properly, the original owners did a half-assed job.  So the second layer of paint, through expansion and contraction, has pulled the seam tape (which was improperly installed) away from the original joint.  Thus the crack formed.

*sigh*

So over the next week I get to scrape away two layers of textured paint, sand down to the drywall, and properly repair the joint.  Incompetance really kills me.  Oh well, we wanted to repaint the living room anyway, and this will give us the excuse ti finally do it.

Elsewhere in the land of carpentry, my special Christmas projet is coming along much better than I had hoped.  When I initially thought of the idea, I was a little apprehensive.  When I bought the plans, I had doubts about my abilities.  But now that I have all of the pieces cut and I am doing the final sanding, I am confident that I can build almost anything.  The next project is a nice bookcase for the living room.  It should be much easier than the object I am currently building.

The dog wants to go out.  I think I better let her out before she potties in the house.  She already pottied in the car today.  Once is enough.

Oy, I really need to post more.  So the holiday season is fast approaching.  What to do?  What to do?  Annoy everyone in my family with a surprise gift for Meredith, that's what to do!

I have decided to build a special project for Meredith for Christmas this year.  It will be very keen, and will test all of my woodworking skills taht I have been learning over the years.  It will involve planing boards to proper thickness, joining boards to make bigger boards, turning wood on the lathe, cutting patterns on the bandsaw, and using the table saw to cut angles and such.  I'm even going to throw in a few of my own personal touches.

The project has been progressing slowly, mostly due to tool problems.  I managed to fix one of the tools tonight using spare parts from my old R.C. car days.  MacGyver would be proud.

On to other news.  We went to the pumpkin patch this past weekend.  My niece and nephew had a blast, and everyone hiked out to the field and picked the perfect pumpkin.  Every year I make it a goal to find the biggest pumpkin I can find.  This year I outdid myself.  The guy didn't even bother to weigh it because it was so big, he said it would far exceed the maximun weight/cost limit.  I was going to weigh it out of curiosity, but I can't be bothered with hauling it upstairs.  And I have no real desire to bring the scale downstairs either.  Let's just say it's a heavy-ass pumpkin.  I am going to my parent's house on Sunday and we're going to have a sort of carving party.  I'll weigh it before I cut it up, just because I can.

The bathroom is done.  Well, there is some very minor touch up painting to do, but it is basically done.  Thank god.  It does look nice, though.

It really seems like I just did this, only minutes ago.

I just had to share this picture.  One of my coworkers found it on the MSNBC website, in a feature called ""Animal Tracks.""  They basically showcase interesting and cute animal pictures.  This is just too cute.  The dog on the right looks just like my little puppy girl.

Yes, I survived.  As did all of my friends and family.  Same goes for all of our collective houses and various other material goods.  I'm not going to bother with some long, drawn out recanting of all of the events that transpired between my last post and this one.  Let's just say everything went well, but it was kind of a let down (in a weird, not-in-my-right-mind kind of way).

Here are a couple of pictures i took of the mass exodus of houston:

Looking South, toward Galveston and where Rita was supposed to hit:

Looking North, toward Huntsville, Dallas and the great beyond:

Yes, the Southbound lanes were emptier than a Kennedy's beer stein.  the Northbound lanes were packed tighter than...well, I'm not going to finish that one.

So that's it.  Hurricane Rita and her drama came and went.  The world will continue on with the numerous Katrina foundations.

And now for something completely different...

Mere and I are remodeling the downstairs bathroom.  I forgot to take the ""before"" pictures, but I do have a couple of ""in progress"" shots for you.  We took out the cabinet and drop-in sink, removed the toilet, stripped the wallpaper off the walls, and ripped up the tacky vinyl floor.  this is the result:

Where the sink used to be:

Where the toilet used to be:

Tomorrow we are putting down a new ceramic tile floor.  After that cures, we will put in new baseboards and paint the walls.  Finally, we will install a new toilet and pedestal sink.  We decided to go with a Mediterranean inspiration, using lots of beige and earthy browns.  It shuld look pretty swanky when we finish.

Glad it's a 3-day weekend!

Ok, this doesn't look good, Monkey.

As you can see from the image above (grabbed from <a href=""http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/"">The National Hurricane Center</a>), Tropical Storm Rita is headed straight for us.  By the time she hits, the people that know about weather have predicted that Rita will be a category 3 hurricane, similar to Hurrican Alicia that hit in 1983.

Well, pretty much everything in Houston is built to withstand a Category 3, so I'm not too worried.  Kudos to Meredith for going to the grocery store now to get some bottles of water and other miscellaneous hurricane supplies.  Before it hits, I think we are going to join my sister and parents at my brother's place in Spring.  That should put us far enough away from the storm to avoid the worste of it.  Still, I'm not too worried.

Earlier this year I predicted that, given the overly-active hurricane season forecast, Houston would get one.  I didn't think it would be big.  In fact, I had predicted a 2 at most.  Well,  looks like we're getting one.  We were overdue anyway.

Good luck to everyone in the area.  Learn from the Katrina debacle and take precautions now, before it's too late.  I don't want to turn on the t.v. to see you on your rooftop waiting to be rescued.  Nor do I want to see you walking out of Best Buy with a brand new 50"" plasma screen t.v.

But if you do get a t.v., can you grab me one, too?**

So Hurrcane Katrina came and went, and now a sizeable portion of the USA (90,000+ sq miles) has been destroyed or otherwise affected.  When the whole thing happened, my first reaction was pretty much the same as everyone else:

Where the hell is the US government?  Where is the military?  What is the presidetn doing right now?  I was angry.  I was pissed.  When the tsunami hit South Asia, the timeline for US involvement goes a little something like this (thanks to ""Dad"" on <a href=""http://www.bit-tech.net"">bit-tech.net</a>t for the research):
-- Within 24 hours, U.S. Navy P-3 Orion reconnaissance aircraft began flying missions over the affected areas to help assist in the search and rescue effort and to assess the extent of the damage.

-- More than two dozen U.S. ships (including an aircraft carrier battle group, a Marine amphibious group, and the hospital ship USNS Mercy, which remained after the main Naval forces departed) and over 100 aircraft were dedicated to the disaster relief effort at an estimated cost of some $5 million a day.

-- Six Maritime Preposition Ships from Guam and Diego Garcia also were dispatched to the area to provide critical drinking water: each can store about 90,000 gallons of fresh water and is capable of producing 36,000 gallons daily.

-- Within 48 hours of the tragedy, with news reports still estimating that ""20,000 people are feared dead,"" the U.S. Pacific Command was already establishing a joint task force to coordinate and conduct humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.

-- Three days after the tsunami struck, Combined Support Force 536, under the command of Marine Corps Lieutenant General Robert Blackman (who also commands the Third Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa), was already playing a key role in coordinating the U.S. and initial international effort.

Now, at 5 days after Katrina made landfall, it seems that the US goverment was just finally stepping in.  I was outraged.  However, I have been reading a lot about the disaster recovery, and it turns out that some people have been digging up some interesting facts.

<b>Posse Comitatus Act</b>

A little thing called the Posse Comitatus Act expressly prevents the President from sending federal troops into a state.  Apparently our nation is a Federalist system, which means that the states have more power than the federal government.  The military cannot be sent into a state without the request of the state itself.  Louisiana Gov. Blanco never asked for the troops to come in and save her state.  Everything that has happened can be blamed squarely on her.  Here is another timeline, this one of the events of Hurrican Katrina (again, thanks go to ""Dad"" at <a href=""http://www.bit-tech.net"">bit-tech.net</a>:

Aug 26: The National Hurricane Center warns that Katrina is expected to reach dangerous Category 4 intensity before making landfall in Mississippi or Louisiana. Hours later, in anticipation of a possible landfall, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco declare states of emergency. This does NOT call for an evacuation or the use of military. This only allows the feds to free money for the region(s) AFTER it hits. Actually, with this act, this should have been a trigger to call for evacuation of low-lying areas and the release of school and municipal buses to evacuate the people who didn't have means to leave as per South East Louisiana's Evacuation Plan Supplement.

Aug 27: Katrina is upgraded to a Category 3, or major hurricane, with the Gulf Coast in its path. During the day, residents of Louisiana's low-lying areas are told they must evacuate; residents in other low-lying areas are urgently advised to do so. President Bush declares a state of emergency in Louisiana freeing up federal money and calls for a manditory evacuation which also starts the mobilization of the military. The problem is that they had to stage outside the ""danger area"" which was very large (Louisiana Mississippi & parts of Alabama were under a state of emergency). If the 26th wasn't a trigger to authorize the use of the buses to evacuate, this should have been the clincher.

Aug 28: 7 a.m.: Hurricane Katrina intensifies to Category 5, the worst and highest category on the Saffir-Simpson scale. 10 a.m.: As Katrina hits 175 mph winds, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin orders mandatory evacuations.

Aug 29: 7 a.m.: Katrina makes landfall on the Louisiana coast between Grand Isle and the mouth of the Mississippi River. 11a.m. Katrina makes another landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi state line with 125 mph winds. Two major flood-control levees are breached, and the National Weather Service reports ""total structural failure"" in parts of New Orleans. A section of the roof of the Louisiana Superdome, where 10,000 people are taking refuge, opens.

Sept 1: Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco requests the mobilization of 40,000 National Guard troops. THIS opens up the gate for the military.

Again, the state of Louisiana did not follow its own evacuation plan, and the Gov. of Louisiana did not make the call to request federal aid until well after the event.

<a href=""http://junkyardblog.net/archives/week_2005_08_28.html"">Junkyard Blog</a> has some really interesting information.  It has pictures of school bus depot that has 255 buses.  If Louisiana had initiated its own evacuation plan, this depot alone could have carried over 16,000 people (255 buses with 66 passengers each).  That would have saved everyone in the Superdome.

Let the fingerpointing continue!

"event","ok, so photobucket.com rules.  i now have a place to host all those pictures i'm always talkling about :-)

has anyone heard of that show on The Discovery Channel called <a href=""http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/amchopper/amchopper.html"">American Chopper</a>?  it's a reality show that follows the Teutuls of <a href=""http://www.orangecountychoppers.com/occweb_ver2.php"">Orange County Choppers (OCC)</a> as they build some fairly pretty custom chopper-style motorcycles.  regardless of what you think of their ""street cred,"" the show is fun to watch.

well, a couple of my coworkers contacted OCC and Discovery Channel about a year ago and threw out the idea of a bike to honor the 7 astronauts of the Columbia tragedy.  the guys at OCC liked the idea and Discovery's producers thought enough of it to make it into a show.  during the course of the build, the project took on the form of a tribute bike to honor the entire NASA family and celebrate the return to flight.  keep in mind, this was NOT a NASA-sponsored project.  in fact, NASA made it very clear that they would have no part in it (for whatever reason).  this project was 100% grassroots.  well, skip ahead to this week and voila, the bike is done!  the bike was unveiled at Space Center Houston, the useless official tourist place for Johnson Space Center.  meredith and i were both able to sneak away from work and, of course, i shot a million pictures.  the Tuetels wre there to show off the bike.  meredith, my coworkers and i all got there an hour ahead of time, so we were in the front row.  i could have reached out and grabbed Paul Sr. as he parked the bike in the center of the roped-off area (at which point he would have pummeled me to an early end).

after work, we all convened on the Outpost Tavern, a favorite astronaut hangout/bar.  the Teutuls had long since gone home, but one of the random guys from OCC stayed behind and brought the bike to the bar so we could all ooh and ahh over it, up close and personal.  again, i took a million pictures.

the episode will be the season premiere, scheduled for early october 2005, so mark your calendars people, you'll get to see my coworkers and the OCC guys pay tribute to all the people who build and fly ""the bird.""

before you head to the pictures, i invite you to take a look at the Tribute Bike Committee's webpage.  donate to the cause!  buy a t-shirt!  they still need more money before the bike is officially paid off.  <a href=""http://www.spaceshuttletributebike.org/"">Click me for the website!</a>

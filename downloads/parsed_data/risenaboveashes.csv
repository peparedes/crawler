"event","So tonight has been a emotional breakdown for me......seriously....currently I'm outside bucking some guys wireless internet connection at 6:23am.....I'm not allowed home, for ridiculous reasons. My mom has been angry with me lately and doesn't want anything to do with me. I guess she finally gave up on me. I made a lot of stupid decisions last night trying to drown out the sorrow but truthfully they only magnified what i was feeling and hurt me even more. I found myself in a worse state of mind then I started out with and now I'm not in the mood to speak to anyone...out of being ashamed..

Truthfully I felt alone and abandoned last night...I had no one to turn to and no one to speak to. Either everyone was not answering their phones or too busy to speak to me...and I was in no state of driving anywhere. I guess fears do come and haunt you, even when you believe youve conqured them. Just cause you killed fear, it doesn't mean its ghost isnt still lingering nearby.

My life has been literally flipped upside down in one night, and I have no idea what to do here...so if anyone out there is willing to let me in on the secret of how to accomplish such a difficult task....I'd greatly appreciate it"

"event","So i just realized the importance of having the person you love next to you. Thing is that its so easy to adapt having them fall asleep on your chest and holding them within your arms, even if its for a few days, then it is to go back home and go back to the norm of only talking on the phone. why is it so difficult? Maybe thats what love is, knowing that having that someone next to you is a necessity or else it drives you insane. You either cope with being far until you actually manage to sink your teeth into being able to feel them and rub your hand down there face, once that occurs...well....you addicted. Just like a drug you desire it once more.

This past weekend was amazing, being able to be with loren for 3 days straight, staying up late watching movies, just laying down and at night having her fall asleep on my chest. I became addicted, its a good thing, but also at times it becomes hard. Makes me want to speed up the process of moving. Either way soon I'll be up and things will be better!

Most of the weekend was spent watching movies but we did manage to go out to eat with Rody and Ashley at Lampus, which was quite entertaining excluding the fact that the guy made his ""famous"" energy drink which is deprived from egg shell, soy sauce, and white sauce. Haha well it was good. Saw Lauren Salm following day and gave her christmas present thats been delayed for far too long. And the Super Bowl was at Ashleys house for a little, since we had to go back to Lorens house to eat, with the occasion meeting of someone and the death glare from Aaron...haha well things wont always be simple.

After all the delays on the trains and the occasion funny smell from people surrounding me on it, the trip was nothign less then pefection!

I was supposed to go today to Orlando and surprise Loren by showing up, Mark and RJ backed out and i got my car taken away, so i was trying to find someone to go to Orlando with someone or borrow a car....no luck...it sucks....RJ said were gonna go next Friday and probably have to be back Sat. again since we might have another show that night....Too bad i didnt get to surprise her

So lately my rents have been fighting with me more....it sucks....im trying to avoid all this conflict....doesnt seem to work...and makes it harder since i have no car

Loren and me are OK......we had a little discussion last night....i exagerated on the situation....but i realized that....and i know she loves me and i love her....thats all i need to focus on right now....hopefully ill see her soon

I might be going to Marks house tonight with RJ to watch The Avatar Movie....its a good show......

I took a run today....it allowed me to value what is good and bad in my life...and I have to decide what im going to do with the bad things...ill make the decision soon

"event","I felt an epiphany today, litereally...and that doesnt come too often....ive been listening to charlie hall all day...i swear hes an amazing worship artist and his songs are powerful....center would probably be my favorite....

ive realized i need to make dramatic changes in my life again, mainly relationships with others....make my amends and give up!...i need to give all i have to God and let him take full control....i was reading a blog tim from underoath wrote a little earlier and he told me this amazing story about a homeless person and how we need to stop trying to take control and if God tells us we must, theirs no doubt about what we need to do.

Things with Loren are still complicated....and im still sticking around and waiting till we can be together...a few people are trying to protect me...mainly since they know i could ger hurt...theirs actually a high possiblity that ill come out of this all bruised and back where i started....but something is telling me to start focusing on the glimmer of hope that i wont get hurt....and thats exactly what i want to do....and something also tells me i wont come out hurt...

So things made a turn for the good....which helps a lot

I got the results in from the doc..and its just something thats gonna go away in a short time...which means i dont have to go to the hospital....YAY! I feel more comfortable and confident that things with Loren will turn out for the better in the end...i started making those changes in my life....and the band is having the promo pics FINALLY taken on monday of labor day weekend...yay!

Loren is supposed to come down friday, and that means if her dad doesnt say against...ill see her and be with her for a little...and id be extremely happy....she mentioned what our future plans are when i move up their and she gradutes...and let me tell you..she thought it out...and is not taking no for an answer....not like ill resist anyways...haha

Ive realized even more what God wants me to do with my life....i feel a strong calling to the music...i know im not the best musician out their...but with practice and him...theirs no way he wont supply me with what i need to survive....but i know the band also needs to take a closer step to him...know the reasons we do what we do...and the reason were still here is cause he wants us to do this....and like our friends at crimson vera said....start every day for him, that he will be our eyes and lead us where we need to be.

Ive been writing some SERIOUS lyrics lately....i dont mean the emo ones....but like strong metaphor's that express what i need amazingly....

They are on me about everything....even if its the dumbest thing...but all i know is that i have less then a year and im gone for a good while!

I was supposed to come up the 25th to orlando, mainly to see Loren and talk to her rents, but that doesnt seem to be happening. It sucks i havent been able to see her what so ever....one of these days...out of pure frustration of not seeing her imma just go up without a warning....she probably wouldnt mind though...haha....but soon enough i will move up there and distance will not be an obstacle. A few nights ago we started talking about what she put in her time capsule, and i would like to say im quite glad in what she put. She believes its foolish girls fantasy but i think otherwise, if they occur then id be one lucky cuban! haha.

He was talking about shoes for about an hour...it sucks i cant tell someone you smell, or go take a shower, or even what the heck do shoes have to do with radioshack? Seriously thats the weirdest thing someone talking to you about soles of a show in Radioshack, specially since theirs no shoe shop near us. Once i get home from work im going to be taking a LONG! shower. 

So the weekend was really good/really bad...i was sick all weekend, i think it was food poisoning from this one restraunt cause i just ate there again and i feel horrible again. 

The good thing this week is im not single anymore..i knew if i waited id find exacty what ive been looking for...and what the big God wanted for me. Im going to surprise her by driving up one of these days, haha its going to be so weird but worth it.

So i have a show the 18th, im preparing myself for it..its going to be an amazing show, and if the stage is big enough danny will do his flip over me like we practiced

Another thing is the band is doing good...we changed the band name to ""Risen Above Ashes,"" mainly because of a few Germans, and were taking new promo pics this week, and its actually with someone who knows what they are doing....yay! 

Ive also been talking to Loren alot, which isnt bad at all. Its really scary how similiar we both are, past and everything. Its funny, since we met because she had to go to the bathroom while i was playing during cornerstone. Haha thats not something you say everyday. She also got me addicted to the spill canvas, they are actually really good.

I also got accepted into the fire academy this past week. Which has been something ive been waiting for a while.

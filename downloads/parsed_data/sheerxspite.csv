"event","hanging out with my ex is like watching someone jumping off a building. you cant stop them and you cant turn away either. such a damn shame and i wish i could blame it one drugs or alcohol but i cant.....

i think everyone hates me and thinks im not smart enough to wash a goddamn spoon.

tomorrow i get burgers with katie and she rules even if she goes to school in ohio (the worst state in the union)

ummm...i think my mom hates me now, oh well its not important anymore, i guess i will suck it up and learn a trade (welding) cause fire,metal, and big dollers rock out

"event","So Yea I hate where I work but I dont hate the work if that makes sense. I have finally gotten over some of my stessed out madness and have calmed down. I know this is nothing more then a midlife crisis. It will pass. I am not going to die soon and the world is vast and wonderous and out there to be explored.
I fucked up. I move on. I am going to survive.
Now it is time for me to move and try and fend on my own. I want to live outside of Clarksville. I want to learn at a community college so I can pad my grades even if it comes out of my own pocket from now on. I want to buy a new car and live with people I dont want to stab every single night of the week.
Soooo...I am going to move. But its not going to be tomorrow. I dont have enough money saved up yet plus Im blowing 200 on a tattoo ala early xmas gift.
Plus why dont girls make any fucking sense?? This is in general not anyone specifically. I think this popped up at work when I was trying not to stick a spoon through the eye of this dumb waitress type female. hahah oh well another long day......
well the gas light is fading fast....

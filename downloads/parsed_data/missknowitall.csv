"event","Merlin, it's freezing in the Common Room. Some one put out the fire and I was just outside. I re-lit it, and I hope it warms up soon. I could use some tea right now, but I have none on hand.

I love the Holidays simply for the feel of them, even though I still haven't seen as much of my friends as I'd like to. If anyone feels lonely or would like to do something, I'd be happy to assist. 

Oh, Hannah, we need to decide how the study group is going to operate so that we can start it up right after break. I'm imagining that some of the fifth years might want help, especially, concerning their O.W.L.s. 

Mum sent me an Owl and her present this morning, though she gave strict instruction not to open it until Christmas (it is clothes, however; You can tell simply by the shape of the package) and I will adhere to her wishes. She said that she and dad are perfectly fine, though they miss me. Apparently, my grandmother is sick, but it's only a slight cold.

I've already finished all of my homework, and I fear I am in need of a trip to the library as soon as I am warm, so that I may have some sort of occupation for the Holidays.

Harry, Ron, wherever you are, I'm up for a game of chess.

Love,
~*Hermione"

Hannah - We really need to set up a meeting schedule and announce it.

Lisa,

There is no point in accusing people simply for the sake of accusing people when you know you shall lose.

"event","I think I'm getting sick. I'm debating going to the Hospital Wing. It's so odd, though, I never get sick, and I do wish I wasn't now, not with all of this Transfiguration homework...

Now really, Ron, Harry, the Ball wouldn't be <i>that</i> bad. Honestly.

I picked up some new books, one of which is in Old English. I'm only through the first half of it, but it is getting easier. I can't find my copy of <i>Hamlet</i>, which I wanted to read again; does anyone else have a copy I can borrow?

I was also wondering if anyone knew of a theatre in our world? I would love to see Wizarding plays, they would be fascinating... if there are any, that is. I hope there are.

Oh, I feel so awful... I am going to go to the Hospital Wing now. I don't know how long I'll be there. If I'm not there tomorrow, will some one please take notes for me in my respective classes?

Love,
~*Hermione"

"event","Apparently, Professor Snape got The Bloody Baron, who got Peeves to let us out. The Staff Room is a nice room, but being stuck in it for seven hours isn't.

In other news, I've finished almost all of my homework for this weekend - I had it with me and there was little else to do, and I had the help of Professor McGonagall at the times when she was calmer.

My parents sent me a letter. The usual - they miss me, they hope I'm learning a lot, they hope I'm having fun, do I need anything... I miss them, really I do. They're excellent parents.

Ron, I believe you stole my Charms textbook. It was either you or Harry but Harry says he doesn't have it. Could you check for me?

"event","The Common Room is an impossible place to get any work done! All of that noise and people talking... honestly.

I'm done with all of Shakespeare's works, so I picked up a few books in the library. <i>The Notions Behind Potions</i> by Mortimer Zerounous, <i>The Advanced Working Of Transfiguration</i> by Varian Veritas, and <i>Chicken Soup for the Healer's Soul</i>, not specifically by anyone, for light reading. I hope they're any good. But I'll read anything once. Almost anything, at least.

It's so good to be back. I miss this place so much when I am gone. The walls, the people (even people like Marietta Edgecombe and Draco Malfoy), the Professors, the noise (yes, even the noise in the Common Room)... it's so familiar to be without it is so odd...

Only two more years...

The thought is mellowing. I shall miss it when I am gone. We all will, I believe, though I cannot speak for everyone.

Love,
~*Hermione*~"

"event","I've discovered the wonders of Shakespeare. <i>Macbeth</i> is so far my favorite, while <i>Hamlet</i>, though brilliant, repeatedly frustrates me almost as much as <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> does.

I'm currently working on <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>, which will be the first comedy I have read.

In other news, mum's already frantic about my going back to Hogwarts so soon. She never opnely says it, but I suspect she wishes I was... well, <i>normal</i> - in her perspective, that is. Then she'd be able to watch me grow up more and take care of me like she used to.

I love her so much, but she can't let me go.

"event","And I'm learning a lot, thanks to Madam Pomfrey. Ginny stopped by earlier, I'm hoping to see Harry soon as well.

The thing is, though, it is rather lonely sitting here tending for a person sometimes, especially if they spend most of the time in a Potion-induced sleep. I wonder how Madam Pomfrey can stand it all the time. I know I wouldn't be able to stand the loneliness of it. My respect for her has increased since the beginning of this.

But I remember when I was here in my second year, and Ron and Harry were in class most of the time, and that was worse. So I won't be leaving until Ron is well enough to come with me.

<i>Has</i> anyone seen Harry?

Oh, I have to go. I'll try to update later. And some one, please get Harry or Ginny so I can have some one to talk to.

Viktor broke up with me.

We were having a lovely time. I hadn't seen him in so long. We kissed, we hugged... and then suddenly, it was all over. He just didn't feel right with it anymore.

And then I found out about the other reason.

It seems he has a taste for other women.

Who happen to be 17, Asian, and Ravenclaw Seekers.

I am <i>never</i> talking to that back-stabbing boyfriend-stealing... UGH! I just don't know what to do! I feel angry and hurt and like I'm about to explode!

I can't even think straight right now.

I'll talk to everyone soon.

"event","Well, I'm very excited. I owled Viktor a little while ago about the Summer sessions, and in the process got an Owl from Cho, who apologized for her actions. And then Viktor invited me <i>and a friend</i> to come to Bulgaria with him for the next two weeks! Now, I could have invited Ron or Harry, but as Ron hates Viktor and we don't even know if Harry can leave yet, and the fact that we leave tomorrow, I invited Cho instead. I knew she'd love it, being the avid Quidditch fan that she is. I just can't wait to see him again.

"event","But I've found a few good books. I don't suppose anyone here has read <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by Charles Dickens? It's not as good as some of his other works - Lucie is extremely one-dimensional the entire book so far, always perfect and faultless and utterly unbelievable, to me, but it's certainly not bad.

Also, I've become rather addicted to Edgar Allen Poe, via my grandmother, whom I found has a rather extensive library. <u>The Raven</u> is my new favorite piece.

Other then that, I received my O.W.L. results, and I'm very proud to declare that I have received O's in everything. My grandmother was so excited, she took me out to dinner and gave me some money. I plan to use it when we go to Diagon Alley, though Ron, Harry and I have yet to set a date.

I called my Mother, and she of course was also very happy about it. She and Father should be home tomorrow. I miss them.

Ron, is there any way you could send an Ink bottle to me? I didn't realize how low I was, and I still have little things to add to my essays and such...

Update!


Jesse has moved out of the Star Rentals/Bowen Homes/Rental Agency consisting the fattest, drunkest, stupidest West Virginian in the world....house.

Now on Kent Terrace(just off of JPA)   

Still in process of moving in/buying furniture.  Roommie here is a girl, kinda cute architecture student, and by the looks of things....ten times the slob, and at least twice the drinker that I am.   We'll see, though.   I don't know why the slob part excites me, but it does.  We're talking pizza boxes all over the living room floor, worn underwear strewn carelessly about the bathroom and kitchen. 

Like. Wow.

Still in C'ville despite the expectations of some people upon my losing of the dream condo (600 a month for a three bedroom, two full bath, recently renovated and gorgeous JPA condo...guy who was going to share the place with me dropped out a the absolute last minute, after making me wait, and stay at Katrina's dorm room for five days while he got his financial shit in order.  Only after all of our checks were in, and the lease was in his hand, did he decide to not go for it.

Despite having little in the way of love or career viability, I'm staying right the fuck where I am.  

Cleveland was ranked the poorest major city in the nation in a recent survey.  We beat Detroit.

THINK ABOUT THAT.

DETROIT!

Don't have a working telephone number yet, but am still reachable via e-mail or AIM.


Despite recent let downs and carpet-yanking...

On a scale of cool to awesome, I'm Super Great."

"event","Dreams:

Last night I had a dream that Matt, Richard, Katrina and I went on some Goonies style adventure through an abandoned high school, but it was weird because we all understood that it was a dream...and throughout it all we would occasionally disappear, and reappear, because we had woken up accidentally, or ""died"" in the dream, and it took us a while to get back to sleep and into the dream world.

We went up a long, winding staircase, which had a dead end, a wall, but there was a chute, a hole in the wall, about 7 feet up. Richard threw Katrina and me (he he managed that, I dont know) and the chute led us into the abandoned girls' locker room.  Matt disappeared.  Katrina and I looked around the lockerroom for a bit, then who should appear but Sujan, Adam, and Farhad, all under a black sheet, trying to scare us. They inform us that they had just fallen asleep, and were here to ""play the game"" too.  But that Richard had woken up and had to be off to class, and that Matt kept being eaten by the ""monster"".  Sujan then started smoking, and pointed to a hatch in the ceiling, which we then opened and climbed up into.  Then Matt, wearing his white and blue canvas shoes came running up after us.  Katrina thought that it was this ""monster"" but then I said, ""no monster wears canvas shoes."" 

Matt then explained that he had ""been killed by the monster like twelve times"" looking for us.  The rest of us were worried.  Farhad said he had to go.  Matt and Sujan said they wanted to explore the dream world some more.  Katrina just sat there.  I then for some reason said, ""I have to wake up now, I have stuff to do.""

And I did.


Apartments:

Apparently you have to be UVA student for this wonder apt. I found.  Luckily, however, ""planning on being a summer student"" is good enough to qualify, and the lease runs out in late May.  I be tricksy.  Though taking a few summer computer courses really is something I had planned on doing.

Neurotic Nonsense:

I don't hate stupid people anymore.  I don't even hate assholes, the Nietzchean bastards, scoundrels, anymore.  They are the salt of the earth, and can hardly help what they are.  

What I hate are people who have the intelligence and experience to do great things, and yet do not.  The people who say one thing and then do another a moment later.  The people who break promises by forgetting they made them.  Selective memories, skewing the truth, refusing to see gray areas--that is perhaps the greatest level of emotional maturity and intelligence: the ability to see gray areas in oneself and other people, and not lump others, or themselves, into wholly good or wholly bad.

This isn't targeted at anyone in particular, it's just a daily musing.  It saddens me.


Stereo:

My CD player is giving out at times during the weather.  The radio station fuzzes back in in fits.  So all of a sudden I have Skinny Puppy or Meshuggah mixed in with NPR talk, or Vivaldi.  It's quite neat at times."

"event","Things are going amazingly well at last.  Perhaps the embarassing fits of Tuesday night were in fact a purging...kind of a therapeutic psychic regurgitation.

Apt:  More or less found.

Job:  Still waiting on, but prospects are many and likely.  PRAVA e-mailed me back and want a phone interview.  Gladness.

Love: Nothing...definite yet.  Certainly a new possibility(rather than an old one) it managed to slip in under my radar, unnoticed till about now.  I dunno, shouldn't get myself too worked up over it, but perhaps Fate's Web does indeed have a pattern, as I've often surmised. 

Evidence for the Pattern I've observed:

My brushes with death, numerous situations where I should have been killed or at least seriously injured, yet walked away inexplicably unscathed each time.  (recent car accident where I wasn't wearing a seatbelt, etc.)

The car radio effect:  When you are sad, heartbroken or feeling similarly dramatic and gothy, the right song just happens to appear on the radio.

Greg Kesden passing me.

The very existence of Matthew Megyes.

The Fearsome Five (my friend group from high school) reassembling at my doorstep on the 26th after 4 years of never being in the same place at the same time. Just when I needed them most, coincidentally.


Anyway...other thing I've observed in the past week: How the symptoms of extreme human emotions resemble one another.  Fitful, uncontrollable crying is vastly similar to the most extreme laughter, to orgasm, and to violent retching.  It's like they're all different movements of the same dance: Rapid breathing, with sparse, but harsh convulsion-like motions; even the look in the eyes of the person looks vaguely similar.  The only difference being which bodily fluid is being expelled."

"event","Sleep study = Total failure.


I could NOT deal with the wires they wanted to hook up to my face.

Allow me to explain, lest I appear a pussy:


Tubes inserted up nose to monitor snoring.   Four electrodes on calf.  Two glued onto sides of forehead.  Two on chest.  Two under jaw.  Two behind each ear.  four on your head.  

Two tight straps around your chest and stomach to monitor breathing.

And it's ALLLLL hook up to a little box that hangs around your neck.

Sleep?  Like this?

No."

Granted this obsessive updating likely won't last and will trickle down to maybe a weekly basis in a month or so...

Waiting for 9 to roll around so I can go get my head examined.

Oh, and if anybody is renting out a room in the Charlottesville area, float me a note...I don't make much noise, and as long as I get my own bedroom, I'm happy.

So this sleep study thing is at 9PM tomorrow, bedtime is at 10:30, and they want me out of there by 7:30AM the next morning.  Given my current sleep schedule of a about,say, 5:30 AM to 2PM, this is not going to work unless sick, awful measures are taken.   Namely: Staying up for another 14 hours or so.

Maybe my resolve will weaken...but hey."

"event","First entry on this thing...finally sucked into the wild, wonderful, kitschy-cute world of livejournal.

I'll try not to do these two things:

Turn this into a pity/woe-is-me soapbox.

Turn this into an epic that revolves around what kind of coffee I drank today and/or how many cigarettes I smoked this week.   


A nice balance to strive for, no?


Anyway...I just arrived back from Charlottesville(7 hour drive from my current home in Northfield, Ohio)   Stayed with Katrina (the ex-girlfriend...still good friends with).  Purpose was to find employment and apartment/living opportunities in the Charlottesville area, which I am planning on moving to ASAP.  

Employment has been more or less found, even if it is at Bed Bath and Beyond and/or Staples for the time being(I've got this degree thingy now that SHOULD be good for something, eventually, and make me lots of money, but up until then...I'll be happy working retail if it means I get to leave dreary, overcast-to-hell Northeastern Ohio).

Anywho...tomorrow I go into the Marymount Sleep Center for a bona-fied sleep study...yes, with electrodes hooked up to my face and all that wonderful sci-fi-ish stuff.  I suffer from insomnia, obviously, always have.  Now maybe they'll tell me my brain is foobar.


More background stuffs later, I swear.

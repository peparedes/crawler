"event","Why this survey why now? Well just as the other surveys were generated, I recently found out a friend of mine wears socks to bed and I was surprised, while they were surprised in the opposite way - that I don't wear socks to bed. Thus in order to prove them wrong (which is oh-so-fun to do!) a survey was created. This is exactly the same process that happened before when another friend told me they kept their butter in the cupboard and I was flabbergasted or when a friend told me they preferred to sleep naked in the summer. So yeah...survey's are fun!

sweet. im an anonymous friend. this is how the entry SHOULD have been:
I was recently in my bed getting hot and steamy with my boyfriend.  We were both naked, except he was still wearing socks because he wears socks to bed.  I wasnt wearing socks because im a dumbass.  Im going to try to prove him wrong, but i probably wont because hes never been wrong.  i need to go masturbate now, as thinking about him has sent me into a horny frenzy. so yeah...surveys are fun!"

"event","super nintendo and lizzy are consuming most of my free time. chrono trigger only took me like 13 hours to beat. i already like mario rpg better. chrono is a stupid character with no personality who can only nod or shake his head no. mario turns into other characters, re-enacts events, AND falls over a lot! the falling over might be my favorite part, reminds me of anime where the characters always fall over when they are surprised. silly mario. he also likes to jump on peoples heads. i beat the crap out of the first boss, Mack, pretty easily to get the first star. hopefully this game lasts longer than chrono trigger.  hopefully this time im not sick when i visit lizzy, that would suck. i need all the energy i can get, so i am going to sleep now. she is an animal in the sack."

"event","2 quizzes today. i did ok. only screwed up a little bit. no classes tomorrow. i found out lizzy is apparently really into vanilla pudding snack packs and she wants to bring her passion for them into the bedroom. i would have preferred chocolate, but whatevs.  need to play more tennis. or maybe go to the gym more. this is the first time i have ever been really stressed out about stuff. at least it will go away for a while in 7 days.  i have been on a bad losing streak in poker. ive lost 7 dollars already! now i am only up 1500 overall. lame.  i hope she doesnt have diptheria or whatever it is called. sounds like some oregon trail disease. need a new game to play thats not pokemon. or a new pokemon game. hewitt plays acasuso tomorrow. good luck hewitt!! ! 1!!"

"event","i decided for the next 25 entries i am going to type in a letter and whatever comes up is my subject heading! AI presentation i dont even remember typing that. i wonder what it means. 7 badges, level 50 sceptile. now only 14 days instead of 349393 days. weekend is here. many options. i could sit and play pokemon. i could go out to chubbys with milo and ramnik. i could play pong in kims room. i could go out to a party with da pilch. i could watch movies. i could practice my telekenisis. i could walk around the campus. i could play tennis with david. i could go to the mall. i could go for a run. yes ill probably do that last one sometime. i need to find more things to do to distract me.  maybe ill take up studying. definitely get a haircut. exanimate is a sad face. too bad it sounded like a good word."

"event","i accidentally typed the letter ""h"" into the subject and that heading came up. weird! grovyle evolved into sceptile at level 36.  i hope lizzy is not failing all her classes because i cant go a week without seeing her :/  she is probably going to fail everything, get kicked out of college, become a hippie vegetarian, and go off into the woods to commune with nature and never be seen or heard from again. i need to realize my actions have consequences. oops!  there are so many mood labels to choose from! i wonder what quixotic means? it has a winky face so it must be good"

"event","it has been an interesting week being a girlfriend/ dinosaur/ ninja. i think i know why lizzy wanted to be the boyfriend.  they have it so easy. they can just go around being guys and not worrying about stuff and can cut their hair whenever they want and can be vampires and not almost get dumped for it on Day 2 and not have their bulbasaurs evolve and stuff.  grovyle is still level 16, i am treasuring our time together.  i cant find Captain Stern to deliver the parcel to him and David wont tell me where he is. what a weiner.  i have to go work on my time machine now. maybe grovyle knows something i dont about it. 

goal of the weekend: regain haircut privileges."

My favorite player lost to the player i hate the most. depressing, i know.  doing work and going to classes should distract me enough to prevent suicide.  and i cant even cut my hair anymore.  how did i lose that privilege?  at least grovyle is level 16!"

My brother's old hockey coach died of a massive heart attack two nights ago. I didn't know him very well, but it's still kind of shocking. He was one of the nicest people in the hockey community (and that's saying something)."

I'd never met anyone who was capable of being friends with absolutely every person she met until I met Natalie. Nor have I ever met anyone so friendly and outgoing but in a comfortable, non-threatening/intimidating kind of way. She was (IS) the epitome of my May Conference '04 experience. I didn't get to say goodbye to her properly at all...fuck, it sounds like I'm writing a eulogy for a funeral, but it fits in a way. In some parts of my mind it DOES feel like someone's died; it feels like there's a hole. I want Natalie back =(




....That being said, I have a super wicked (super challenging) plan of doom. I propose that we as a group of friends/grade/school raise the money to fly Nat back for prom week. It won't be right if she's not there, and I vote that we should try and bring her back. Anyone got any ideas as to how we can fundraise? I'm sure her parents'll pitch in something, and I think it's definitely worth a shot, not to mention obtainable."

I've done nothing but read, work, and see Steve since Boxing Day (when I bought many things with Adam Rachel and Leanne). I put one of my AP English books behind me (The Poisonwood Bible) and I loved it. It made me want to move to Africa...not that that's a very smart idea, but still. I don't want to go back to school, sitting at home reading and doing things when I feel like it is much better. Actually, I just want the rest of this semester to fast forward so it won't seem like it really happened at all. I need a change. The thought of taking a year off and just working is so alluring...but I can't do it, I need to go to university and...but WHY do I feel so pressured to start right next year and study study study until it's over? Where is that coming from? *Sigh* I'll think on it later. For now, Happy New Years Eve."

"event","<P>Wow, last night really hit the spot. Not that it was anything grand or extravangant, it was actually as low-key as things can get, but it was needed more than words can convey. Have you ever reached the point in a relationship (be it romantic or friendly) where it just doesn't seem like you're dating/friends anymore? And then something comes along and makes everything good again and it's the best feeling ever? Yah, I like&nbsp;it when that happens. </P>
<P>On Thursday I went to Bayshore and spent approximately $180 in about an hour or so. Do you know how&nbsp;good it felt<FONT color=#000000>?.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT><FONT color=#000099 size=7><STRONG><U>This good. </U></STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3>Anyways. I bought a pink tank top with lace and it's really cool fabric and yay, and then I bought some new shoes. Yep, something other than skater shoes *gasp*. Then I bought myself a pair of expensive jeans, because I've spent 3 years of my life in mediocre Bluenotes jeans. I bought a pair of Mavi's that fit like heaven having sex with chocolate or something, and yay =) It made me feel REALLY GOOD. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P>So is anything going on tonight? Not that I need anything to do, but yah, if nothing comes up I think I'll end up seeing a movie with my Mum, which isn't a bad thing at all. I like going to see movies with my Mum, but I've done it too many times. Know what I mean? Speaking of parents, my Father started reading again. He's reading the Da Vinci Code, which is a fairly mediocre book in my opinion, but it's a start. I told him I'd lend him the Count of Monte Cristo when I wish finished with it, or Animal Farm or something. Speaking of books, this is my reading list:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Brave New World</LI>
<LI>1984</LI>
<LI>The Cather in the Rye (I have like 5 pages left to go in that book)</LI>
<LI>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</LI>
<LI>The Odyssey (sp?)</LI>

<P>I played my oboe today for 3.5 hours straight. It was weird, I started playing when it was 1:30, and looked up again from it when it was like 5. Then a screw fell out of my oboe and a piece fell off and my heart stopped, my world crashed for about 20 minutes while I searched for the screw (which is the size of half of a housefly) and I actually found it again 0_____________0. How fucking lucky is that? Anyways, AND MY WATCH TICKS AGAIN!</P>
<P>I have work tomorrow. Boo. But I work with Matt. I like Matt. He has to wear a hairnet now and when I saw him on Thursday I laughed and laughed and he glared at me but it was ok. </P>
<P>I like classical music, did you know? *Sigh* I'm going to go read a book and eat some food now....or talk to people on MSN. Hi Steve!</P>"

"event","I went to see Earl of March's rendition of Anything Goes last night with some people. It *obviously* wasn't as good as Stratford's, but Stratford lies beyond the space and time and can never be touched, so yah. Their pit was better than what I'd been expecting, and, while the singing could have been rehearsed a little more, it was a generally well done show. I like that the Gabriel in the show was a girl on trumpet, that made me proud. Also, before the show I went to Ali's house, and she was taking care of a cat next door because the neighbours were on vacation. I went over with her and she showed me their guest bedroom. Actually before I launch into this I should just say that it was the most interior design savvy (saavy? whatever) house I've ever seen. Anyways, this guest bedroom was just nuts. Picture Victorian times in like Italy or France or something. White hardwood floors with gold diamond patterns painted on them. Huge darkly varnished armoir hiding behind the door. A porcelain vase full of peacock feathers. White walls with a queen sized bed right in the middle of the wall protruding out with a wonderful white duvet and pillows with pictures of roses on them. What looked like lace curtains. And then there was the make-up stand. Picture the most gilded, girly, old fashioned tarnished silver make-up stand with a huge oval mirror hanging over it and a vase with roses and a tray of perfumes and little novelty containers. My jaw actually dropped. It was the most beautiful specimen of a room I've ever seen. *Sigh* Anyways...

TODAY I work a nine hour shift, and then hopefully do something with Rachel, and then I work tomorrow (even though I asked them explicitly to NOT book me for entire weekends, but whatever) and then I'll be coming home to do homework. Exciting, no? Hmph. Anyways I'm being kicked off the computer. What a useless post. Meh!"

Yesterday night I went to see the Grudge with Rachel. Bad idea? Mmm, not sure yet. Damn scary people crawling all over the place all rigid and evil, and the little kid, *shudder* wacko. Sarah Michelle Ghellar was surprisingly not bad in it, and Jason Behr is....well he's just good looking. Anyways, we had a non-stop commentary show sitting to the right of us for the entire movie. These 5 guys didn't shut up ONCE, and made fun of the stupidest things imaginable. I felt like I was back at Macbeth, except much scarier and with really bad popcorn. I saw Ms. Hall at the theatre. She's talking to me again! Haha she's so insane, and her and her sister look VERY similar. Know who she's going to see on Saturday of next week in Toronto? BRIAN GREENE!!!!!!!!! *mad jealous rage* He's one of the leading physicists researching String Theory right now, and I've read his book and everything. Bahhhhh, I wanna go see Brian Greene *pout*. Anyways, then Rachel and I had a sleepover and it was quite enjoyable except I mysteriously acquired a cold, and I threw up, so no drinks for us. Sorry Rachel =( we'll get to sometime, I promise. We lazed around this morning and....it's just a very sleepy day. The family is coming home tonight, but I'll probably still end up being able to go to the leadership camp dance anyways. I won't know how to park downtown, but I'll still give it a shot. *Sigh* I need to start (and finish) my bio lab and then go to work. I don't WANT to go to work. I want to SLEEP. Hmph. Bye."

So, what the hell am I doing this weekend? I'm not sure. You're not sure. We're all not sure. Stupid leadership camp *grumble* I feel like burning a hotel down. Anyone want to join me?

I sat my book on it's spine this afternoon and watched the book slowly open of its own accord. The interesting thing about it was that both sides of the book (ie both covers) moved at exactly the same time, exactly the same distance. This is weird because the book wasn't sitting EXACTLY on its centre axis or line of balance or whatever. Were I smart enough and had enough initiative, I'd go exploring to find out why it does that. It probably has something to do with gravity (actually that's dumb to say, everything has to do with gravity) anyways, it amused me. One of the few things that managed to do that today.

Pit band this week. I can't make it for tuesday, but the rest should be fine. Everything seems so mundane this year. I'm concentrating too hard. Life loses its vividness when you concentrate too hard. Focus too hard and things start to go blurry, right? Right.

Stop it, c'mon, you know I can't help it. I got the mic and you got the moshpit. What will it take to make you admit that you were wrong?

"event","What was the point? Why did I even get a job? So that I could book all the time they'd give me off? Well I'm sorry, but I might as well fucking quit. I've made a commitment, and I'm legally bound by it. What're they all bound by? Their STUPID obsession with minor league hockey. *Sigh* K, history.

Last Saturday I had a 9 hour shift booked. What did my family want to do? Talk to my managers and tell them to re-book me because Mark had a hockey game that day and it would have been inconvenient for them to come and pick me up. Thankfully one of the girls I work with gave me a drive home, but if it hadn't have been for her I would have been standing outside the Loeb until like 10 at night, or I just wouldn't have gone in. Now, I just went to book off the 30th of October because Mark has yet another game and it wouldn't be very convenient if they had to come and pick me up. Well I'm already booked for the shift, and Mum's gonna call my manager and ask them to let me off. FUCK. Why did they even support the idea of me getting a job if all they were going to do was complain about the shifts I got. They seem to think I have the power to choose my shifts? NO. So I told Mum to make me a list of all the days between now and January that I need to book off because of Mark's hockey. The sheet she gave me had like, honestly, 25 dates on it, all of them weekends. Most of what I work is weekend stuff. 

I've never really paid much attention to the fact that Mark's hockey is the be all and end all in my house, and that everything I'm good at and everything I do has always and will always come after Mark. Now I'm finding out that Mark has games straight through December 1st to 5th. For those of you who don't know, those are the dates for Oklahoma (excluding the 5th). I'm losing it. I really am. If they don't come and support me I don't know what I'll do. Sound selfish? Yes. Think about my reasoning though. I'm sick of always being considered second.

I hate living in a cornfield.
I hate always being second, in every single family function, ever.
I hate having to re-arrange my life and lose money due to their stupid obsession.
I hate hockey.

If someone were to burn down the metaphysical Minor Hockey League headquarters I would dance on it's metaphysical charred remains and pee on it's metaphysical grave.

Wow, I'm in SUCH a bad mood right now.

"event","""In the last decades of the twentieth century, scientists began to study the complexity within the human brain. Talk about Chaos! It turns out that the brain is a galactic network of a hundred billion neurons. Each neuron is an information system as complex as a mainframe computer. Each neuron is connected to ten thousand other neurons. Each of us is equipped with a universe of neurocomplexity that is inscrutable to our alphanumeric minds. This brain power is at once the most humiliating fact about our current ignorance...""

"event","Last night was cool to the max. Dad drove me to the...Cyberccino (??) cafe to meet Rachel and from there we walked to the Videoflicks and rented a movie. Waking Life! Big thanks to Steve for introducing it to me, I'm now spreading the Waking Life phenomena to everyone...well Rachel, but I'll spread it to anyone else who's interested. It's all philosophical/documentary/thought-provoking/weird to the max cartoon stuff all about the difference between waking life and dreaming life, and neo-humanism, and perfection, and language, and symbolism, and communication, and the faults and strengths of our society....and just...yah...absolutely amazing. Anyways, then we went to Starbucks and then to Dairy Queen for cold ice creamy strawberry...y....things. We got back to Rachels and shat around for awhile and then watched the movie, then launched ourselves into a hardcore coffee shop-like talk about all of it and more and yay =) I like talking about stuff like that. We went and ate something, and then shat around in Rachels room until like 4 in the morning. The peak of hilarity, do you ask? was when we began our Masterpiece Theatre with shadow puppets on the walls. LMFAO, it's the hardest I've laughed in a really really long time. I don't really genuinely laugh really hard anymore....that's worrying, and a little depressing. Hmm...definitely something to think on. Then we went to bed, woke up and due to some misunderstanding Rachel left at like 10:15 for a driving lesson so I stayed at her house and waited until my dad came. Today I do something with Steve, and then tomorrow I study for two science quizzes on the same thing! This was a bunch of fluff, I'm sorry"

This is what comes of blaring Phantom of the Opera too often people! *Drool* Oh I would have sex with that musical, and bear it's children afterwards. 

Last night was Zoe's sexy pahtee!!! It was cwazee! Hoobah for sobriety...yes, anyways I showed up with Rachel and they'd already gone at the pinata. *Pout* I wanted to have a go at the pinata. Anyways, then more people showed up. Actually, not too many definitive things happened. Umm....I saw many people I haven't seen very much this summer! Hi Justin and Nat Brown and Lauren!!!! whom I haven't seen at all. And PJ *hug* Hi PJ. Umm....I went swimming! Me and Laurie and Lauren and Justin and Jocelyn and later Sonia all jumped in and fooled around for awhile. After that....some stuff happened...then some more stuff....then guys were singing raucously in the basment. Then I took a walk with Jenn! In my bare feet! In a parking lot! I got glass splinters in my feet! The first one was really painful but I got it out and it bled some, but I lived. The second one is still in there, but it only hurts if I apply pressure to my foot in a certain way, so it can be avoided. Then Steph and Jenn decided to play Nicky-Nicky Nine Door, and Nat B and I walked back to the house. Lots of people left, and then Laurie and I stole a room and talked into the wee hours of the morning. We were visited by Emily Hill, and I dunno whether she was drunk, tipsy, or just overly tired, but she talked to Laurie and I forever! It was by far the funniest thing that happened all night. In short, it made my week.

I woke up this morning and promptly dressed and called for a ride home. Then I walked to Hazeldean Mall to catch that ride because I didn't know how to give directions and I didn't know Zoe was awake. I walked to Hazeldean Mall in the lightly misting rainy weather and it was really refreshing! It wasn't enough to get me wet, but it made my skin cool and my walk much better than it may have been. And here I am! Today I do nothing except maybe the Ex."

"event","Tonight was cool. Although I don't like how this has become a place to simply recount my day, none of you like that. Anyway, I saw Em and Jenn and Boj and Trivs and PJ and Jamie tonight. But when they all decided to go back to Jamie's new mansion in like West Carleton I remembered that taking the car out for the night does have a price, and realized I couldn't go with them because I had to pick my Mom up in an hour. *Want social time*. Anyways, Broken Cue wasn't very exciting. When we first got there I was excited because there was a chance that Ryan was there and, aside from simply loving him to pieces because he's an awesome friend, I was looking forward to talking to him because...well...let's just say there're some people that aren't doing too well right now, and I wanted to talk to him about it *tear* =(. Anyways he wasn't there, so I moved on. The Cue was boring to say the very least.

That being said, I was left with nothing to do for an hour. I called Steve to see if he wanted to chill for a little while but he was already asleep. So I wandered around and finally ended up just waiting around at the hospital for Mum to finish. Driving alone is so soothing, I can't say it enough. And now I'm home, getting ready to sleep.

Ok, so 1500 years ago (or whatever) the Greeks promoted freedom of thought. It was a great time, and everyone was happy, but they all thought the same way, if you really look at it. Women were property, white robes were the hippest of hip, the philosophy discussed was all related in some way. Everyone was excited about their culture....but they still all essentially thought in the same way. In the Renaissance people were excited about the leaps made in science, art, music, whatever. They seemed to have everything...but they had nothing compared to what we have in those disciplines now. They thought they had it all....yet they still essentially thought the same way. Present day: women are considered people, we dress in very revealing manners, cultural diversity isn't as distinct as it once was. We're at the cutting edge of technology, science, music, drama, whatever....yet we still all essentially think the same way. Freedom of thought doesn't truly exist, because it's shaped and guided to fit something even we can't escape from the day we're born. I don't think we'd be able to cope with true ""freedom of thought"". Truthfully, I don't even think we know what that phrase means. 

Sometimes I wish there was a rip in the fabric of space and time that allowed me to fall into some alternate universe, for a blessed blessed change in perspective. I just don't know what to think right now. *Sigh* that'd be neat.

Rachel: WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. How about next Friday if not sooner? (And next Friday even if we do manage a sooner). Book work off, I'm not even kidding. Just find a way to do it. If you think I'm joking call me.

Laurie: Huzzah for our talk at my house! I had lots of fun. Now we can look at each other's bum when we walk, we'll be the coolest cats around man. ;)

Steve: DON'T GO TO SLEEP SO EARLY ANYMORE. Call me when you get back. Oh and have fun on your trip/ I hope you had fun on your trip because I doubt you'll see this before you get back.

Zoe: E-mail me back! I'm macho excited for this saturday! =D

What would it be like to fall forever? Would you ever sleep? How could you fall forever? There must be some sort of bottom. You'd probably die of hunger, and then waste away, and then nothing would be falling anymore......that's really weird to think about.

I'm too tired to do this....but I'm wired at the same time. Jeez I hate feeling like this. And I miss Martain :(

Martain: I miss you! I live like 10 minutes away from your house! *Does the lives-close-to-Martain's-house Dance). That took way too long to type. Hahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

They're cutting down my wheat field =( no more golden wheat thingies swaying in the breeze. They make everything look pretty from a distance, especially when it's a sunny day with blue skies and fluffy white clouds, then it's just damn picturesque. I could have made a postcard of it. I don't know who I would have sent it to, but I could have made one. 

What was your first impression of me?

There were some people at the hospital tonight that were in visiting a relative (husband and father I presume) who's so full of cancer that they're just waiting for him to go. He's on so many sedatives that he's stopped talking. What do you say to someone who has to watch someone go through that? (Sorry FJ if I'm being insensitive :S ) I didn't have to say anything, of course, but it was hard to watch.

Dying would be like waking up from a long sleep, that's the only way I can possibly try and comprehend it. Every time I think about death, that's always the way it seems to happen. Maybe what happens after depends on the person, like the way we're born (premature, C-Section, normally, breached, etc.) And it would be just like starting over. Jesus I've turned morbid. This is a sure fucking sign that I need to go to sleep right the hell now. Sorry to everyone who had to read these last two paragraphs.

Finally, today before I went out I found my cat sleeping on the guest room bed. I went in and sat down beside him and started to scratch his chin. My arm was positioned in relation to his body in such a way that he wrapped his entire little kitty cat body around my arm and went to sleep hugging it. It was the cutest thing I've ever seen. Absolutely dead serious, nothing has ever been cuter. I love my kitty.

"event","The past couple days have been fun. I shall recount them because I have nothing better to do, and nothing better to post. H'ok, yesterday:

I woke up with a retardedly sore back among other things, and realized that I'd left my chili bowl at Max's (Laurie and I had gone over the day before to feed and take care of Max and Chris, and I had made them chili). I drove back to Max's to retrieve said chili bowl, and upon getting there realized that all 3 boys were still sleeping (3 boys= Max Chris and JT). So I quietly took my chili bowl, left a note by a pipe, and left. Driving by yourself is really relaxing and soothing, it provides good thinking time. I don't really remember what I thought of, but I know I had fun. Anyways I got back home and Mum drove me to Steve's. Steve and I shat around for awhile, and then his Mum came home and took us to Steve's Dad's work to drive some funky new cars. We drove around in a Dodge Hemi (sp?) a very nice looking, nice sounding, nice moving (I don't know a think about cars) car. We wanted to test drive a Crossfire too, but they wouldn't let us *frown* now thats a pretty fucking car. Hhhhhhh'anyways, then we went to Petsmart to play with kitties, but never really got around to it. Then we went for some fine Italian sandwiches and then back to Steve's house and we watched this incredibly cool movie called Waking Life I think? Anyways it was about this one guy who can't really seem to decide whether he's awake or dreaming, and it's just him interacting with a bunch of philosophical people. It was an animated movie, and it was REALLY good. I enjoyed it =)Then we watched some gymnastics (ps Canada's sucking ASS in Athens eh?) and then I went home to sleep. Fin #1.

Today I woke up and did something with Steve again (quelle surpris!) I went over and we shat around for a really long time. Then we decided we were hungry and walked to the grocery store. We picked up some salmon, fresh dill, and potato salad. Upon coming home Steve discovered the BBQ was still broken, so we had pan-cooked cajun salmon instead. Very nice =) Steve=good cooking. *Sigh* so full. Oh we sat outside and read for awhile too, pretending to tan. Anyways, then we sat down and played a video game...well I watched. It's called.......I have no clue what it's called, but Adam Wray is playing the same game right now. Whatever. RPG games are a bunch of random battles, the discovering of different crystals and healers and rods and some really complicated player statistics. I guess I just don't appreciate them enough, but holy crap. Then Mum came and got me and now I'm here! Fin #2.

Tomorrow? Tomorrow I go to Montreal to visit my Aunt *very long, very blank stare* *cough* *die*. Should(n't) be fun. Maybe Dad'll buy something for me again like he did last time we all went down. Either way, we leave at 8:30am tomorrow morning and that makes me unhappy. Hmph. Anyways, thats about it for now. Fin #3."

"event","Worst dream ever last night. Well almost worst. It ranks 3rd on my list of Worst Dreams Ever. The first being my psycho basement dream, and then 2nd one being about my Mum dying. This third one is also about my mom, but in some ways it's even worse than the second. Still....here:

Somehow my Mum and Dad had split up. I'd been trying to get in touch with my Mum for weeks (my brother, father, and I were living at my grandmothers at the time) but I couldn't get through to her. My Aunt came over for a visit and they started arguing about how she wasn't fit to be a mother. I overheard them as I was in the guest room, and ran into the living room to tell them off. Then my dad told me (here's the kind of dumb, but heart-shattering part in my case) that Mum had seen an ad on TV from the orphanage. They were have a 2 for 1 special that week or something, and so she was adopting new children, because she didn't want us anymore. My Aunt started telling me how sorry she was for me, but I crumpled up on the floor, crying. I didn't believe them.....except deep in my heart I couldn't help but believe it, I'd seen the ad on TV myself. I decided to find out for myself.

I ran all the way from my Grandmothers house to home (which is a feckin' long run, you should all be proud of me). I snuck into my room on the second floor for some reason, and went to Mum's room. She wasn't there. I went downstairs and found her sleeping on the couch. I stood by the entrance to the kitchen and woke her up. She asked me what I wanted, and I asked her if it was true that she was adopting new children because she didn't want us anymore. Actually, I only got halfway through my question because in the middle of it I broke down into sobs (the kind where no sound comes out cuz you're putting so much into it). There was a blue towel on the coffee table so I snatched it up and hid behind it because I was so ashamed of crying. Then I woke up! I was crying, but I remembered it had been a dream, and all was well.

Oh and for the record my mother does in fact still love me and would never adopt new children to replace my brother or I.

Umm...the rest of my life has been boring. Except for Max's party, but I don't really wanna go there. Thanks to Ali and Zoe though! *lovelovelove* thank you for holding me up when I couldn't really walk and for talking to me. *Sigh* that is all."

I woke up this morning with a head cold. Boooooooo urns. Not that it really mattered, I had no plans anyway. I read for 2 hours and then went out with Mum. She bought me a travel journal from Winner's and it's VERY nice. And she bought me a candle holder. It is pretty as well. Hoobah.

Yesterday Mum took me to Bayshore and bought me a necklace and some earrings. Then she bought herself some Bluenote's socks because she wore a pair of mine to work and got tonnes of compliments on them, and now she's vowed to never wear plain socks to work again. She's cute =)

Also, new Wheel of Time book comes out soon!!!!!! Buahahahha. Called the Knife of Dreams. I know I'm excited. I'll buy it in hardcover, but I'll buy it again when it comes out in paperback so my collection looks pretty.

Can you tell I have nothing real to say and I'm trying to cheer myself up? Atleast I have plans tonight, I'll go and be girly and laugh and yay.

Oh and Laurie, I DO like horses, so mnaahhhhh.

<i>""Imagine, Paul said to me once, that the present is simply a reflection of the future. Imagine that we spend our whole lives staring into a mirror with the future at our backs, seeing it only in the reflection of what is here and now. Some of us would begin to believe that we could see tomorrow better by turning around to look at it directly. But those who did, without even realizing it, would've lost the key the perspective they once had. For the one thing they would never be able to see in it was themselves. By turning their backs to the mirror, they would become the one element of the future their eyes could never find.""</i>

"event","I hate how bi-polar I can be. I'm at home right now, so I'm semi-downcast (as always when at home) but I don't feel quite as uncomfortable as I did last time I posted. Hormones or resolved conflicts? I really don't want to know, that's a question that's best left unanswered. Anyways!!! Resolved shittiness nonetheless. 

On Wednesday night I went to Jenn's after oboe lessoning. Steph, Zoe, and Shannon were already there, and Ali and Nat B. pulled up just as I did. Natalie's back!!!! Eee it was good to see her again. Anyways we shat around for awhile, and walked to the park at Franco Ouest (past like 6 gangs of shady looking boys) and Zoe called Chris and it was uber cute, but I was too shy and unsure of myself to talk to him. Meh, I shall later on. Upon coming back from the park Steph, Shannon and I power-walked back to Jenn's house. Well..they called it power walking, I call it the speed I normally walk when I'm not with anyone else. So half of our gang headed out, and Steph, Zoe, Jenn, and I remanined. Em came over and we joked around for awhile until Zoe and I went home. My mood was so good I went to bed smiling, not even my house could take it away from me. 

On Thursday Steve and I hit the beach. It's my first time going to a real beach since...*counts* grade 6/7? The summer in between them. Yaaay Bermuda! Anyways, Moony's Beach was...well not as pretty or as relaxing, but wonderful nonetheless. I'd just like to say for the record that Steve is a big wimpy-bum when it comes to cold water. It wasn't cold, for the record also. We swam lots and read lots and I ALMOST tanned. *Blink* I don't think I've been tanned since my time in Bermuda either. I didn't burn, which is also a first. Anyways, let's all go to the beach again! Soaking in the sun is a perfectly good waste of a day. There were too many perfect people in perfect bathing suits looking perfect for my taste, but I suppose that was to be expected.

And that has been my happiness streak of happy. Tonight I'm cooking some type of Medeterraniandfghjggbaf (can't spell) seafood soup, and them I'm going to eat it all. Yay long weekend! Oh and doesn't my new journal look nice? If you're looking at this through a friend page GO LOOK AT MINE JOURNAL. I spent like half an hour hmming and hawwing over it, and then I did override colour thingy-ma-bobbers and that scared and confused me, but I lived and my journal is beautiful as a result. Hmph."

"event","Happy Birthday Journal!!! *waves flag and spins noise maker* One year old, I'm so proud!!! Umm nothing much has happened at all. Summer school's over! Hooray!!! Exam was yesterday and I never have to go back and YES. It was...well sufferable because I knew so many people. My teacher was also an asshole, but we won't go there.

It's weird, thinking back to one year ago....it's amazing how much your life can change in one year. I never thought I'd be anything like what I am now one year ago. I'm thankful though, I don't think I could ask for much better right now....except maybe some Crunchy Cheetos, I have a BIG craving right now. Do you ever look back on yourself, even if it's the day before, and wonder how you could have ever been so naive and dumb and immature in comparison to yourself now? I do it all the time, everyday, and I can always tell when I've learned something new. Looking back on the day before if I feel like I was dumb and ignorant the day before, I'm satisfied in knowing I've learned something. If that feeling doesn't come, then I haven't learned anything really worth knowing; something really valuable. I'm rambling now I know...but meh!

Anwyays, Happy birthday Journal! Oh and Happy Birthday Justin tomorrow! Yayy 17, one year closer to being of legal age. *Blink* I can't wait. There's so much less crap that'll have to be put up with when I finally make it to that blessed age. Anyways, I have my summer back!! All of you call me and make plans with me....because I love you all."

"event","Did I tell you my watch got fixed? Well.....my watch got fixed. Not with the old band, but with a new gross ugly band that's only bad because it's not my old Roxy band *selfishly pouts* I object. Other than that, due to circumstances that shall be revealed here I basically have the car to myself when I'm not in summer school, when Mum's working, or when Mark needs to go to workouts.....so slightly more than normal.

Summer school has been almost unbearably dull, but doable. My ISU book is really the only thing that's carrying me through that class right now and I have to finish it this weekend *sob!* so I need a new one. Mum bought the Rule of Four (like Da Vinci Code but with an ancient manuscript instead of lots of paintings) and it's been very good so far, so maybe that'll be my new EscapeOption of choice. It's hardcover though, and is therefore awkward to stuff in a bag full of a bag lunch, a binder, and 3 other novels. Ahh the trials and tribulations of the average teenage girl.

Oh and by the way my English teacher is thought (by Dave and I) to be a religious fanatic, and we spent almost all day today discussing religion as it pertains to the book we're reading. Not stuff important to theme, character...or even plot for that matter, but trivial things that come about during rampages unsettlingly similar to those I used to have to sit through with Skippy. In short: I have to finish that book this weekend too, and I can't wait to be rid of it.

*Wave* Hi Steve! Thank you for coming to see me today at lunch! It had been a week *glower* but everything was wonderful :) I found the car parked for me at school when it was done and then I had the pleasure of driving myself home. Usually I don't mind driving. I find it mildly stressful (ever since my incident with the parking post at Bayshore I haven't been the same) but today was just fucking annoying. I've come to the conclusion that teenagers (or the parents of the teenagers, whichever they happen to be) couldn't drive their way out of a wet paper bag. I'm not even kiddng.

Because I have sole ability in the house to drive the car I have to pick Mum up tonight, and Mark's work-out prohibited me from going out and having a nice relaxing evening (Sorry Rachel!) but I'll spend it reading. I'd tell someone to come and rescue me from my books, but I'm not sure I want to be rescued. ALL I do is read now, it's getting bad....but so so good. So.....I want to be a library when I grow up.....a mourning dove just landed on the window sill outside the compy room window and we stared at each other. Then it started bobbing its head around and hopping up and down and flew away. I wanna be able to dance like that without getting made fun of....flying wouldn't be too bad either....OFF TRACK! Oh..well I wasn't being interesting anyway. MOVING ON!

Someone make plans with me for Sunday (Rachel you got first dibs, but let me know sooooon! The Board awaits...haha that's right, it's grown important enough to have a capital letter) Oh my life is in a sorry state of affairs right now. I'm gonna go eat some soup. I'm on a soup craze right now. Like, when I can it's ALL I'll eat. Soup with salt and pepper (soup permitting) and then grated cheddar cheese on top (soup permitting) MmMmMmMmMmMmMmMm.....*sigh* alright I'm done."

"event","<P><EM>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a day or two since I had been separated from my sister, I had been sent to wahs some rags one afternoon, when a moth came fluttering down from the sky onto my arm. I flicked it off, expecting that it would fly away, but instead it sailed like a pebble across the coutryard and lay there upon the ground. I didn't know if it had fallen from the sky already dead or if I had killed it, but its little insect death touched me. I admired the lovely pattern on its wings, and then wrapped it in one of the rags I was washing and hid it away beneath the foundation of the house.</EM></P>
<P><EM>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hadn't thought about this moth since then; but the moment it came to mind I got on my knees and looked under the house until I found it. So many things in my life had changed, even the way I looked; but when I unwrapped the moth from its funeral shroud, it was the same startingly lovely creature as on the day I had entombed it. It seemed to be wearing a robe in subdued grays and browns, like Mother wore when she went to her Mah-Jongg games at night. Everything about it seemed beautiful and perfect, and so utterly unchanged. If only one thing in my life had been the same as during that first week in Kyoto...As I thought of this my mind began to swirl like a hurricane. It struck me that we -that moth and I- were two opposite extremes. My existence was as unstable as a stream, changing in every way; but the moth was like a piece of stone, changing not at all. While thinking this thought, I reached out a finger to feel the moth's velvety surface; but when I brushed it&nbsp;with&nbsp;my fingertip, it turned all at once into a pile of ash without even a sound, without even a moment in which I could see it crumbling. I was so astonished I let out a cry. The swirling in my mind stopped; I felt as if I had stepped into the eye of a storm. I let the tiny shroud and its pile of ashes flutter to the ground; and now I understood a thing that had puzzled me all morning. The stale air had washed away. The past was gone.</EM></P>

"event","When the weather is this shitty, and plans aren't supposed to start for another 3 or so hours it's amazing how little there is to do. In the space of about 10 minutes I tried to read a book, write in my real journal, and watch a movie. None of them stuck I guess, and I'm SO BORED. Not even bored, but the tired, sluggish feeling you get on days like this that prevent you from finding the motivation to do anything at all. Let's hope the movie cheers me up.....wow and now I've lost all motivation to do this either. *Sigh*"

"event","Brad's party kicked some major feckin' ass, save for a few snares that I found out about after the fact. I got my drink spilled all down my front, burrs in my pants, and just social enough to have a good time. Also thank god for tents, because I didn't get soaked when it started to rain. Then my brother graduated yesterday and he went to his grad dance last night with his date!!!!!!!!!!!!! If any of you know my brother you'll know how fricking exciting that is. He said he might ask her out too! I fell asleep before he got home and woke up after he left for school, so now I have to wait to hear all about it until like 3 this afternoon and that is stinky. Meh! Today I get my hair cut and go to an oboe reed making lesson (yay!!!) They're actually much harder to make than they look. It takes a very precise hand to shave of x millimetres y millimetres long and then soak it for exactly 10 minutes and measure it like 80 billion times and wow it's fun :D I can do it in about 15 minutes now (minus soaking time). Also the knife I use it sharp :S as I found out last night whilst making a reed. ANYWAYS, then I see Steve and....yah I don't have many plans for later on, so everyone make some with me!!! *imposing stare* for now I'll just do annoying internet quizzes that no one cares about.

"event","Summer!!!! For now it's shortwinded because of my summer school adventures, but yah. Laurie's pahtee on Thursday! Arrival at like 5:30 and yay!!!! We went swimming and I haven't been swimming in such a long time and oh my god I love swimming and yah I was happyhappyhappy. After swimming we ate dinner and then went to Twisty Cream. There was a horse show on at the fair grounds but no one would let me go pet the hourse *shakes fist and glares* but ice cream was good. Then after about a kilometre more walking Zoe and I went running in a field and sucked the sugary stuff out of the purple clover heads and played Daisy petal games. Apparently our boyish interests love us not *hmph* but yay then lake! This time I wasn't mad about going because it wasn't raining and boo outside. We got to the lake and laurie promptly dislocated her knee or something to that extent :( I'm SO sorry Laurie, I felt so horrible. So after Chris returned from his romp in the woods (thats SO gross Chris!) he carried her back home and when we got there Steve was standing in the middle of the kitchen. *Blink* hi Steve! Then swimmins in and Laurie had to go to the hospital. *more sad and I'm sorry!* We popped in a movie and had hot wild sex I MEAN.....*shifty eyes* lol, we watched Space Balls. Eeee I like that movie. Laurie came home and disappeared and then Steve left and then I went and found Laurie and......lots more things. Some people went swimming again, but I fell asleep. I woke up at like 7:30 the next morning and went downstairs to find Laurie and Martain watching TV. WE WATCHED RAINBOW BRITE. My day was complete after that, but then Chris came down and we ate an entire cherry pie between the four of us. Sooo good but so very very disgusting at the exact same time. After trying to throw Max in the pool without him waking up (it was a failure) we went swimming and I didn't get out again until Mum came and picked me up. Holy crap man I love swimming. This has been my last couple days. I felt I should update, so there ya go. Bye!"

"event","Late Afternoon Thoughts:

-What determines the phenomena of 2 totally unrelated strangers having the same thought(s) at the same time? Is it some connection of a higher being? Coincidence? The same brain waves stimulated by similar neurons?

-Is this phenomena even real? There's no way of proving it, because the 2 people having the thoughts don't know each other, and therefore no contact would be made to verify it.

-If it doesn't....what does that tell us?

-Thinking that it is possible, and that it does happen, brings us a sense of security and belonging. If someone else is thinking and feeling what I am right now, it must be alright. There's someone out there who understands. I'm not alone.

-But most of us stubbornly insist that we are the only ones that have EVER felt this way before, only we understand (even if we don't admit it, we do think this)

-So if we insist no one else understands us, then how can we believe that someone else shares the same things we do? What significance does this have?"

"event","Last day of school yahhhhhhhhhh! I got there this morning and we all sat and talked. Music I went to write my summative for math. Easiest. Thing. Ever. He let us leave after that, and...wow I can't remember a lot of yesterday. I think I went to the music room and hung out with people. Then off to media...well adventures with Adam who was in search of the elusive yearbook. We finally tracked it down to the drama room, and then went back to media to watch presentations for the rest of the period. LUNCH! Got more signing of yearbooks in, and it was generally good! English consisted of receiving our essays back and watching movies. Guess who got a MOTHER  FUCKING 95% ON THEIR EXAM???? Yah, that's right, I DID. I almost peed myself...because I'd thought it was crap :S (I'm not lying, I was honestly so rushed to write that thing its not even funny). Then we watched Cirque Du Soleil for the rest of the class. Those people are absolutely amazing, I'll never even come fractionally close to the level of physical fitness that they have....losers. Lol. Then math was skipped. I'd already done math summative, so he wasn't expecting me back. I spent it in guitar class, and it was fun save for Sir's kind of bad mood. Then after school while waiting for Steve to finish moving desks with the rugby team I curled up in a corner and read (you're welcome Laurie!). After which I went to Bayshore with Steve and bought the new New Found Glory CD. Now before you all start throwing stones at me and hissing, its actually not that bad. It's much more musical and well thought out than their last 4 albums, so don't worry. Oh and I also got socks (thank you steven) and then dinner at NYF and then back to Steves to watch TV and generally bask in the thought that we don't have to learn anything until next September (well...he doesn't, I have summer school, but it's english so I'll enjoy it). And...yah that was my day! Today I'll start the studying of math and english, and maybe music...but probably not. Out!"

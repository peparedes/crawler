Chelsea F.C.
You ain't 
Got no history
Five European Cups
And Eighteen Leagues
Now that's what we call history

Peter Crouch again has proven himself worthy of my worship. Beautiful header past Cudicini in the 80' to secure the first trophy for Liverpool this season. I was disappointed to see Gerrard start on the bench, but a beautiful goal by Riise and Crouch and I knew it was all Liverpool's. 

Sheffield United v. Liverpool on Saturday. Can't wait."

Seriously this is how you make one.
You poor caramel syrup into a blender and put ice and coffee based solution at the bottom. Then blend. Pour into a cup and put whip cream and caramel drizzle on it. AND DRINK THAT SHIT UP!
Please stop showing up to Starbucks and ordering this shit of a drink. Seriously I'm tired of making it."

"event","""Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,   
The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights   
Her stove, and lays out food in tins.   
Out of the window perilously spread   
Her drying combinations touched by the sun's last rays, 
On the divan are piled (at night her bed)   
Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.   
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs   
Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest   
I too awaited the expected guest.  
He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,   
A small house agent's clerk, with one bold stare,   
One of the low on whom assurance sits   
As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.   
The time is now propitious, as he guesses,  
The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,   
Endeavours to engage her in caresses   
Which still are unreproved, if undesired.   
Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;   
Exploring hands encounter no defence;  
His vanity requires no response,   
And makes a welcome of indifference.   
(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all   
Enacted on this same divan or bed;   
I who have sat by Thebes below the wall  
And walked among the lowest of the dead.)   
Bestows on final patronising kiss,   
And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit...   
  
She turns and looks a moment in the glass,   
Hardly aware of her departed lover;  
Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:   
'Well now that's done: and I'm glad it's over.'   
When lovely woman stoops to folly and   
Paces about her room again, alone,   
She smoothes her hair with automatic hand,  
And puts a record on the gramophone.""   

- T.S. Eliot

"event","Speed on CSI just died. He was shot. It was terribly sad. Sigh..

I went out tonight with my mom. I didn't want to sit and home and think about things. My mom bought me a really soft jacket. I like it a lot. She also bought me some chinese food and that was wonderful. 

My weekend was good. 

Friday I got to hang out with Adam, Rachel, Lauren, and Lori. We went to Trilogy and I watched Lauren get her belly button pierced and Lori get her lip pierced. I felt left out. But it was interesting to watch. We ended up at Mike and Nick's place. I ended up doing their dishes. Odd. 
 
Then on Saturday I went down to the Cooper-Young Festival with Rachel, Diana, Ashley, Alex, Jake, Lauren, and a few other people. It sucked. But then we went to the show at the Caravan. I only watched So She Sang. They were wonderful. After the show a bunch of people ended up at Lauren and Lori's house. It was cool. I ended up staying the night. That was the best part. heh. I didn't get too much sleep. It was wonderful though.


Wow.. they found the kid on CSI. That's happy. very happy. They are still very sad about they're lost CSI man though.

I got a part in the next play being put on at my school. A Midsummer Night's Dream. I get to play a fairy. A contemporary ""cool"" fairy. I have like 6 lines.. maybe. But it'll be fun I think. The show runs in early november. I will expect to see you all there. 


Next week on CSI there's gonna be a drive by. I can't wait.


I'm so ridiculous.

I didn't know someone got beaten to death at Westside High School. Did anyone else know that. Apparently it was a gang act gone too far. That's so sad. 


hm.. that's it for tonight. 

oh and this..

1. Who are you? 
2. Are we friends? 
3. When and how did we meet? 
4. Do you have a crush on me? 
5. Would you kiss me? 
6. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. 
7. Describe me in one word. 
8. What was your first impression? 
9. Do you still think that way about me now? 
10. What reminds you of me? 
11. If you could give me anything what would it be? 
12. How well do you know me? 
13. When's the last time you saw me? 
14. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't? 
15. Are you going to put this on your journal and see what I say about you?"

and i don't feel any different.
the clanking of crystal
explosions off in the distance.

so this is the new year
and I have no resolutions
for self assigned penance
for problems with easy solutions

so everybody put your best suit or dress on
let's make believe that we are wealthy for just this once
lighting firecrackers off on the front lawn
as thirty dialogues bleed into one

i wish the world was flat like the old days
then i could travel just by folding a map
no more airplanes, or speed trains, or freeways
there'd be no distance that can hold us back.

there'd be no distance that could hold us back 

so this is the new year 

New Year, Death Cab For Cutie


Sometimes I would like to vanish. I don't hate my life or the people around me. I would really like to run away, though. Run away to another city or another country. Not lose contacts with my family and closer friends. Something completely new. All by myself. I want to go somewhere and start fresh. Make something different of myself. A whole new image. Sounds kind of silly, I suppose. But I'm sick of the ache of repetition. I'm tired of the same sights and smells. Don't get me wrong, though, I like it here. I especially like the people. I just desperately need something new.

Everything inside me wants to scream and just let everyone know. Maybe just something new to do something more involving. I need something to be passionate about. I don't care about politics or animal rights. I just don't. I love art and music more than anything but I don't think I'm talented enough at either one to do anything with it. Maybe I just havn't had the right chances. I havn't been in the right place at the right time. This is so frustrating.

I'll live though. Nothing unexpected. Sigh"

I think Rachel, who is my best friend, has officially started to hate me. I think it's been coming a while. I kind of hate to admit that. Things in the last few weeks have not been right. I'm not sure what it is, or was. It makes me so sad. I really like Rachel a whole lot. We made a good team. We were good best friends. Rachel and I reminded me of those friends you see in movies. The inseparable kind. The ones who would build a tree house together or run away together and regretfully come back home together. The ridiculous things we have done together and to each other. I swear almost every night we hung out I had more fun on the way where ever we were going then when we got there. I bet she doesn't even know that. I love the way her passengers seat was labeled as being mine. I miss her and it's been like a week since we have talked. I sound pathetic. I am. That's enough about that for now. I'm about to cry.


My eyelashes are stiff with makeup and my eyes hurt. My feet are asleep and my fingernail polish is peeling. My shirt is covered with fuzz and my pants are cut up sweat pants. But you know.. I don't think I could care any less. I am kind of happy with myself at the moment. It's a strange feeling to me. Maybe worth mentioning. Maybe not.


Terry has been home for a couple weeks. It's been really nice. I miss him so much when he is gone. He has about two more weeks until he has to report back to MRC. That makes me sad. I don't want him to leave again. He could be gone anywhere from three to six more months. Him going there is for the best though. He thinks so too, I think. I hope. The place is not the greatest from what he has told me but it doesn't seem awful. The only thing that I really don't like though is that when they are in this place they aren't allowed to look out the windows. The windows are there and all. But if they look outside they get punished. I would go mad. Fast. Although I don't spend a lot of time outside I really like it. Especially when it's raining. Can you imagine hearing the calming and beautiful sounds of the rain but not be able to look at it. Much less be in it and feel it. I would not be able to do that. I am very proud of Terry for doing it.


Jay's Journal is what I am reading now. It's a journal, obviously. If you like them then I would suggest this book. I am about half way through it. I bought it tonight. It's quick, easy, reading. It's not really written all that well, in my opinion but it stands true to a real journal. I like it for that.


Writing this has made me tired. The plan was successful. I'm thirsty."

While searching for the tire block in the trunk I found this.. how odd

The show on Sunday was so awesome. I really likes beloved and come back kid. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed them. I also got to see a bunch of cool cool people. I love going to shows at the riot and the caravan. I like people. They are mostly all really nice and friendly. Later sunday we went to waffle house. I think Rachel and I are going to make it a weekend tradition to go there. The waffle house by the chi in particularly.

I wasn't too hungary so I just talked on the phone for a while.

I'm sure no one wanted to see those pictures but a big thanks to rachel for taking them all!


Thanks for reading and looking at my pictures everyone!"

I'm sorry if you don't like the lyrics...

I don't even know what to think or what to say. I don't know how to start this off at all. I am so mixed up. I feel like my whole morning was a dream. I have this really strange feeling in the pit of my stomach. It is like a uneasy feeling kind of regretful. 

Have you ever cared about someone so much you don't know how to feel? Then once you're beginning to figure things out they get torn out your life. It's a terrible feeling. I have felt like that for about 3 months now. 

I don't really want to tell anyone who reads my journal what happened this morning because it isn't something someone should post on their journal just out of respect. But I'll say that I got to see the person who got torn out of my life this morning for about half an hour. It was the strangest experience ever. It was completely unexpected. I was woken up by my phone and someone very familiar was calling. It was this amazing bitter sweet feeling. I was so happy to hear their voice but at the same time I knew I shouldn't be. They shouldn't have had a phone. That phone call was about 3 months too early.




It's been about two hours since everything happened and in my memory everything is already being blurry.






Ehhh.........






I don't know









So hmm.. I made a new friend! His name is Jake. I met him once at the caravan a while ago and he was really mean to me so I have always thought he was a mean guy. But for the past like week he has redeemed himself eminently. He was nice enough to bring me home friday night even though I live in missouri.. not really..but far. I stole his lighter when he was bringing me home because it was orange. I hate orange. I'm sorry if anyone likes it. I painted his lighter red and it is most beautiful now. I think he liked it too. I would be glad if he did. Anyway, I think rachel and I are going to go keep him company for a little while today at his work. That will be nice. Hopefully he won't mind too much.


I am out of it definitely..


Ever had a dream that felt real?


Ever had a day that felt like a dream??





Here's to hope! 


and


Here's to grace!


They get me through my days.


thank you to my dad for all his help this morning. He is a great man. I wouldn't mind having some of his personality traits. I love him, I really do. Sometimes he sucks and is mean but sometimes I suck and I'm mean. We even out I suppose. Actually, he's way better than me. Man.. this is so ..



thank you rachel for helping me out this morning when I was sad. I love you. You're my best friend and I'm glad. We're awesome.

All my life and more
And now I see so clearly
What I could not see before.
The time is now or never
This chance won't come again
Throw caution and myself to the wind.

There's no promise of safety with these secondhand wings
But I'm willing to find out what impossible means.
A leap of faith.

Parody of an angel
Miles above the sea
I hear the voice of reason
Screaming up to me
""You've flown far too high boy now you're too close to the sun,
Soon your makeshift wings will come undone""

But how will I know limits from lies if I never try?

Theres no promise of safety with these secondhand wings
But im willing to find out what impossible means.
Climb to the heavens on feathers and dreams
Because the melting point of wax means nothing to me.
Nothing to me
Nothing to me

I will touch the sun or I will die trying.
Die Trying.

Remember the entry I made on Thursday, November 20th, 2003? I talked about how I always get attached to stories. Today I learned something spectacular. Rachel does too. She read a book called Sloppy Firsts and is now in love with it. Much like myself and The Perks of being a Wallflower, which I incidentally got back from Mrs. Singerella. She said she really enjoyed the story and I got a 98 on my book report. hooray. I've strayed from what I was talking about, I'm sorry. Today on the way home from school Rachel was telling me all about the story and the characters. It, like The Perks of being a Wallflower, is a journal. From what Rachel had to say I am very very excited to read Sloppy Firsts. There is a sequal to it as well. That is always good. It's call Second Helpings. I can't wait to get started on these books.

I have yet to finish The Fuck-Up. It's a really good book but I can't really get into it. I will finish it soon though. I always have to finish books. 

Well I made an 81 on my chemistry test yesterday. That was very very good. I still have about a 60 in the class. I am working hard though. Two weeks ago it was a 40. So, hooray for passing chemistry tests. I tried out for this play at school yesterday. I didn't make it. There were only 3 girl parts and 36 girls tried out. I wasn't too surprised. Gretchen is one of them though. Good for her. She deserves a good good part. The are casting another play though. I may make that one. I would like that. I hope I do. I like to be involved with the theater. It's almost always fun. I finished my second edition of my magazine of beautiful people a couple days ago. It's neat. My mom and dad have looked through them and seem to like them. For everyone who doesn't know what my magazine of perfect people is it's simple pictures of all the beautiful girls and a few gorgeous guys I've torn out of magazines and pasted into a spiral. That way if I just want to see a bunch of lovely people I can just look in there. It may sound dumb. Maybe it is dumb. It was my idea so I don't think it's dumb or I wouldn't have made it. But maybe everyone else would. I don't know.

I am going to follow the trend and post this on my journal..

1. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it.
2. Am I lovable?
3. How long have you known me?
4. When and how did we first meet?
5. What was your first impression?
6. Do you still think that way about me now?
7. What do you think my weakness is?
8. Do you think I'll stay married? Would you like me to come visit you over the next few years?
9. What makes me happy? 
10. What makes me sad?
11. What reminds you of me?
12. If you could give me anything what would it be? 
13. How well do you know me? 
14. When's the last time you saw me?
15. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't? 
16. Do you think I could kill someone? 
17. Describe me in one word: 
18. Do you think our friendship is getting stronger/weaker/or staying the same? 
19. Do you feel that you could talk to me about anything and I would listen? 
20. Are you going to put this on your livejournal and see what I say about you? 

By trend I mean I saw two other peoples journals with this on there. But, hey, why not? Oh and not be rude or mean at all but if you are one of those people who hate me or strongly dislike me please do not post a bunch of stuff about how awful I am. I would really not like that at all.

I have a friendster account and on those accounts you get things called testimonials. I got one from Tyler Logan and Shawn Zorn today and it made me very very happy. Here read it..
Shawn-Tyler, 12/09/2003: 
 
 
Shawn: Reagan, you're nowhere near 18. But you're awesome though, and the cutest little girl ever. 
Tyler: One of my favorite girls in the world. She's always bubbly and is in the chipperest of moods. We've gone through a lot together and I can honestly say that she is a genuinely awesome girl. Her character is one of a kind and she's not afraid to fight for what she believes. I love this girl!!! She's the sweetest angel/demon I've ever had the chance of getting to know/fight. I miss you tons and KEEP ROCKIN!!! 

sigh. I really miss Tyler. Last year I got a hug from him everyday after school. I looked forward to it. He is the best guy I know. I want him to come visit me next time he is in town. I told him so too. I replied to that testimonial with a message and it was nice. I just thought I would share that with you guys.

Oh my goodness it's later than I thought it was. I better go to sleep. 

My power just went off and then came back on like 5 minutes later. I thought my entry was going to be lost. That was terrifying. I has taken me about 40 minutes to update this journal. It's all for Rachel. I <3 her. 

Anyway I'm off to sleep. Have a good day everyone. 

Who's reading my journal? Post and let me know."

Sigh. Yesterday was such a lovely lovely day. Around 2 yesterday afternoon Ryan D. and his friend Sam came and picked me up after a small amount of trouble finding my house. Then we headed back to Arkansas. Although not long after we left Ryan just had to go to the bathroom so we stopped at a gas station and he went in with no shoes on, just socks. Nasty. But after that we were back on our way. We were on the highway going like 80 or something when Ryan and Sam decided to clean out the car, which wasn't either of theirs. Ryan threw a cup with a can in it out of the window and some sticky liquid went all of the back window. It was funny. Sam and I laughed really hard. It was great. Sam is really pretty and really nice. I like her. At Allisons in Arkansas Allison told me everybodys name and pointed them out. I only remember Austin and Jake. Everyone there was really nice though. A lot of the people there were vegans so there was pasta for them and a salad. I'm not a vegan but I had pasta anyway. I had potatos and green beans too. Weird meal, but quite good. Nice job Allison. After we ate, the guy I mentioned earlier, Austin made up this amazing game. It was emo kids vs. hardcore kids in memphis. He made it up completely. He made the whole game out of videos and index cards. I was impressed. So right as we were about to play this game Ryan was going somewhere with Jake and a few other people so I decided to go along with them. We ended up going to memphis and all these other places I really don't remember for some reason. I do remember going to Crackle Barrel to meet Jakes friend. While we were there Ryan and I ran, literally, inside and looked at all of the lovely items Crackle Barrel has to offer. That was nice. Then we all ended up at Bradleys house. Where the scene game was played. It was spectacular. I got to see a bit of the Justin Timberlake special on tv. It was cool that he was at the New Daisy when it was filmed so that dumb place was on national tv. After that we went to the Caravan to watch a few bands play. The first one was awful. I beat some girl at arm wrestling and that made me feel awesome. But I also gave up at a game of checkers. I suppose I could just say everything evened out. Sounds good to me. I ha to be home by 11 last night, an hour earlier than normal. I guess because I have be gone so much lately. So a really nice guy named Alex brought me home. Ryan rode with us. It was the best ride home from the caravan ever. sigh. It was so excellent. Once I got home I was just in a good, almost light, kind of mood. So I just got on the computer for a little while and then went to sleep. I felt good. Yesterday was spectacular. 

my nose is so cold. my feet are cold too. but i don't care. 


Today rachel, chris, and I all saw a movie at the $2 theatre. It was cool. Not amazing. Not mind blowing. Not action packed but still nice. Very simple. Lovely. 

good night"

in that small mining town
i was ready for quitting
my guard was down
it was summer all day
in your dad's chevrolet
and so we decided to stay

and we want spectacular views
if we're to stay for the weekend
and you swear
there'll be no bad news
if we stay, if we stay without looking back

we'll take a small private room 
with a window please
if it opens that's fine
to let in the breeze
we've been waiting all year 
for someone to just say
everyone fucks up it's going to be ok

and the prop planes 
they fly overhead
you can hear them returning
and maybe it's all in my head 
but i'll save my complaints for tomorrow

and when you got sick i was sad for some days
but i'm feeling much better
i just sleep it away
now it's just like 
we never was 
some things go bad just because

and the freeways 
they go coast to coast 
they've taken away all my good friends
and i don't care if you're broke
you can't stay here tomorrow

and the dreams have come back again 
but this time i'm not just watching them
its me as pilot instead 
and i land the plane all by myself
no you can't stay here tomorrow

I let someone borrow a book today. I have never done that before. I let my english teacher, Mrs. Singerella, borrow The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I did a book card on it and when I explained the story to her she was into it. She reads really fast so I'm sure I will get it back fairly soon. I caught myself being sort of reluctant to give it up. Simply because I liked the story so much. I suppose I can survive without it for a few days. I am now well into the second chapter of The Fuck-Up. It's good so far. I feel so artistic right now. I don't know what I should do. I could paint a picture or I could right a story. I have so many options but I probably won't do anything. 

note to self: remember these The Smiths songs...
This Charming Man, Girl Afraid, Sweet and Tender Hooligan, You Just Haven't Earned It Yet Baby, Oscillate Wildly, Rubber Ring, The Headmaster Ritual, Unhappy Birthday, A Rush And A Push And The Land Is Ours ...

Have you ever known you had a lot of work to do and then all you wanted to do was sleep? I get that feeling a lot. I want to take a nap. I have to do some art projects and study for a chemistry quiz. Then I have to write an english essay. I'm so excited. Except not really. hmmm...

Terry has been on my mind a lot lately. I am so curious to know what he does during the day and what he is going through. I want to talk to him more than anything. I love talking to Ms. Elaine, his mom, though. She gets to visit him twice a week and so I just wait for my updates on what's going on with him. It's nice to know some little things. I still am keeping a journal to give him. I think he'll appreciate that. I miss him a lot. I wonder how Jason feels about the whole situation. I havn't talked to him about it. I probably won't either. I never talk to Jason anymore. I havn't in a long time. I remember a couple of really cool conversations with him too. Oh well.. if he ever reads this then he should know I am willing to chat it up with him anytime. I still consider him my friend until he tells me otherwise. With that I think I am done for now. 

everyone should take a nap.."

But it does not matter to me although it seems like it should.
It's because I know I'm understood when I hear Him say
""Rest in me, little David and dry all your tears, you can lay down your armor and have no fear cause I'm always here when your tired of running, and I'm all the strength that you need"".

It's up hill
both ways,
tomorrow I swear
I won't act this way.
And I know it seems like
that is what I always say.

But it does not matter to me although it seems like it should.
It's because I know I'm understood when I hear Him say
""Rest in me, little David and dry all your tears, you can lay down your armor and have no fear cause I'm always here when your tired of running, cause I'm all the strength that you need.""

You know I want to be like Jesus,
but it seems so very far away,
and when will I learn to obey, obey?

I got a new book! It's called The Fuck-Up by Arthur Nersesian. I am very excited about starting this book. I have heard it is a really amazing book. Last night I had the coolest time. I got to hang out with Eddie and Ryan D. for a while. We went and ate asian food and we all chipped in like a dollar or two and got one big vegetable plate with rice and shared it. It was like a family dinner where you pass one plate around. Constantly during our meal we were laughing and making fun of little things. It was great. Then we went back to the caravan and I really had to go to the bathroom so I asked Ryan to take me somewhere because he wanted to go and do something else anyway. So Ryan, Eddie, and I all ended up going to the peabody place and going to the bathroom. It was fun. The best part was on the way there we had the windows down going like 65 miles an hour in a 30. We had the music all the way up and we were all singing along as loud as we could. We were all out of key and it was beautiful. I felt infinite. The wind and sounds. The way everything around me was a blur except for the people I was with at that moment. It was perfect.

Well we lost the football game. The first juniors to ever lose! How exciting. By the way hello to Andrew Parks! I said something about you. Enjoy. I cleaned up my room today and bathroom. I got a new skirt and a new pair of pin stripe pants today. I was quite happy. I love making new friends it's like the best thing in the whole world. I love my old friends so much. But making new friends is exciting.
 
I had the best dream last night. I dreamt that I had lung cancer. So I went to some clinic in the woods somewhere. While I was sitting around at this place a mother and son walked in and checked in. They sat down nest to me. After a few minutes the mom started to ask me questions about how the place was and what I thought about my disease because apparently her son had the same disease as me. We had become really close friends. We had been together all the time for months. It was kind of beautiful what kind of friends we were. Not like girlfriend boyfriend friends. Not like brother and sister friends. But like more than that. So one day we both got sick and tired of being at the clinic. We decided to just run away. We ran into the woods and just kept going until we hit this graveyard thing. Except it was really small and there weren't tombstones just little metal name plates on the grounds. I stepped on one on accident. I yelled because it cut me and then these two wolf/ghost like things jumped out of nowhere. They were like people and wolves. They were white and grave and walked on two feet but with a bad hunch. They had ears like wolves. It was scary. So the boy and I ran back to the clinic all the while being chased my the creatures. The moment we jumped out of the woods into the area around the clinic the creatures disappeared. But from all the running it had made him and I much worse. We walked into the clinic and sat down and while holding hands we both died. It was really sad. But the dream was like a good book or lifetime movie or something. Hmm.. I loved it."

I finished The Perks of being a Wallflower today. I am so sad it's over. I am not sure why I get so attached to one certain story so much. If I were to guess, I would say that I sort of form an alternate reality for myself. Then once the story is over I don't have a place to belong and then I feel so lost. Not to say that I don't have friends who are great but sometimes I feel so different from everyone.. like I can't relate to anyone. But when I read a book and see characters in my mind and read their words and thoughts I know them better than anyone I really know. I trust the characters. I am comfortable with the characters. I couldn't honestly say that I know anyone like that. The closet person to being like that would be my brother, Cody. Although he is younger than me and we are really different I would trust him with anything. I am glad I have a brother. As a matter of fact I think I will make Cody read The Perks of Being a Wallflower. He would enjoy it. I wonder if I am the only person who get so wrapped up in stories like I do.

  So tonight is the powder puff football game that I am playing in. I am more nervous than excited. Simply because I missed a lot of practices and I am not sure what I will end up doing.. if anything. I guess I will just have to wait and see how it goes. Rachel and I have yet to start dance party. I think I am going to start ""working"" in the garage by myself. I really want my diet to work. Although I cheat with little things a lot. Like reese's little mini cups must be my weakness. Something like 3 of those a day. The little small ones not the full size ones. I tried the RC cola we have that I am allowed to drink on my diet and it wasn't to bad. I will just eat all my reese's and not buy anymore. That will be my plan. Well, since I have figured out that I think I will go ahead and get ready for my football game tonight. I hope you have a good night.

be safe everyone."

"event","It is very late and I should be asleep but I can't fall asleep, ah well. This weekend was cool. I kinda didn't do a lot but I wasn't at home much... I liked it. Just sort of wandering around all weekend. Since I can't sleep I have been thinking about random things. One of the things that I realized it that when a guy holds a girls face when they are kissing, to me, that is so romantic and so sweet. I kinda always knew that but wow.. yea that is amazingly sweet. I'm not sure if that has ever happened to me before. I think so.. maybe. But yea.. that is pointless but I wanna remember it."

"event","Hooray Hooray! I have a live journal now. This should be interesting. 

I had a thought the other day about how one day the cute little babies or just little toddlers will one day date one another. They will cause each other the best happiness and worst sadness. I'm not to sure why but that really got to me. Just the thought that those little children are so innocent and unhurt. Just to be completely free of all responsibility. No school... no cleaning... no parents. Just good things everywhere... nothing to bad, you know. Ah, how I long to just be completely happy."

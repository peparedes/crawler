"event","bye
you aint never gonna see me again if i can help it
little fella take it easy
fresh out of forced tears, kisses, and hugs
youre about to lose the company your misery loved
i never did anything but try to kill your disease
at least help your symptoms 
instead you infected me
im not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand
if you got to draw at all then its time for you to scram
p.s. you can keep all this shit
and hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich

the strugglin i did with you was all for nothin
it was never enough
your heart was set on suffering
i admit that i was weak in the beginning
i wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship
i didnt think i deserved a true partner
so i transfered the arrangement i had with my mama

bitch you never listened to a word i ever said
maybe seeing this door slam will get it through your head
i dont love you, i dont think i ever did

theres nothing more for us to say
got my mind made up, im walkin away
sometime we outgrow the role that we play
hope you find a happy ending to your story some day

round and round and round we used to go
i never fucked you right or made enough money, i know
if im such a bastard and mistreated you so
then how is it youre losing your mind to see me go?
truth be told i held you together
for two damn years and i cheated on you never"

so, i want to go pick up my package from ups.. great, cant wait..

so as im leaving the parking lot of my apartment complex, of course there is stupid rivershit trash blocking the way. one piece of shit blocking the way with his tow truck. and the other piece of shit blocking the way trying to push his car. im not mad at the fact that a car had to be towed, im mad at the complete lack of respect they showed, they could have easily done what they did without blocking anybody. 

then i get to ups. and for some reason i had some kind of crazy preconceived notion that you needed to pass the third grade to work at ups. turns out i was WRONG. these fucking retards didnt have my package again. the second time.

FUCK YOU RIVERSIDE. ONE MORE MONTH AND IM MOVING OUT, THEN TWO MORE MONTHS OF SCHOOL AND ILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN."

adrenaline like a rookie cop
can i turn the siren on? please
never before have i been so secure
with my reactionary inabilities
and shes killin me again
its the same old tale
ive been murdered a million times
but somehow i keep comin back to life
the same mountain i continue to climb
im not as confused as i am considerate
back and forth between my cigarette and her clitoris
im workin on both like its nobodys business
such an odd way to gain gods forgiveness
and all of my friends believe i should forgive myself 
they insist that ive done nothing wrong
but im not convinced until i finish every bottle on the shelf
and i run out of reasons to write my songs
and all of her friends think im holdin her back
shes beautiful, but they dont know the half
theyre barely aware of a fraction
blinded by dramatics
ignoring all the passion

wooden ships on the water
rescue me

clash of the titans
to balance the excitement
challenge the enlightenment
and flash my vice grips
maintinance man keepin faith in my plan
if its possible ill fix it
and if not then ill kick it
there was a time when i would follow it into a storm
and all i wanted was someone to keep me warm
but now im torn by my tolerance
i fight with my head
i dont need to pollinate a flower thats dead
and every one ive built ive watched wilt
and every one that has built me is killin me
and as much as i love her
neither one of us should suffer
so imma glue both her wings back on and watch her flutter
cmon fly butterfly
dont cry
shut your eyes
gonna watch each other die before we give it another try
hover little humming bird
dart through the sky
ive been under the thumb
its no wonder im still shy

hunger
onward with my desires
learned the hard way not to play with fire
from a comfortable distance ill admire
because ive gotta take a break
im exhausted im tired

wooden ships on the water
rescue me"

"event","<P><EM>We showed previously that children with amblyopia show significant deficits in motion-defined form perception. These deficits are found in both the amblyopic and the nonamblyopic fellow eye. Performance on low-level direction-discrimination tasks is often normal in these children. The purpose of this study was to examine performance of amblyopes on high-level motion tasks based on attentive tracking. We tested each eye of 8 children with unilateral anisometropic amblyopia (9 to 16 years old) and 20 age-matched controls on 1 low-level motion task and 4 high-level motion tasks. Children with amblyopia showed similar performance to controls in both eyes on the low-level motion coherence task and on two high-level motion tasks: the maximum number of targets that can be tracked in a multiple-item tracking task; and the perception of ""long-range"" apparent motion in a four-dot quartet display. However, they showed significantly worse performance than controls in both eyes on the maximum speed for tracking a single target, and in visual search for a biological-motion target, two tasks that are linked in other studies to limits of temporal attention. These results suggest that amblyopia may be accompanied by a loss in both eyes of some aspects of temporal attention. In contrast, a recent report finds deficits of spatial attention in the amblyopic eye of adults with strabismic amblyopia.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Contrast sensitivity functions were measured for sinusoidal gratings from a sample of 10 anisometropic amblyopes. A high spatial frequency deficit was found from tests of the amblyopic eyes of all subjects. This defect decreased with spatial frequency and was correlated with the magnitude of anisometropia. Controls were instituted to rule out psychophysical method and residual defocus as possible causes of these effects. At low spatial frequencies, there were small differences between the two eyes. For some subjects, sensitivities of the amblyopic eyes appeared actually higher than normal whereas the reverse was found for most of the others. Additional tests demonstrated that the low-frequency differences could be accounted for by magnification differences (aniseikonia) between the two eyes. These findings are consistent with the idea that monocular contrast deprivation is the causal agent in anisometropic amblyopia.</EM></P>
<P>I was born with anisometropic amblyopia. I must confess that one day I fear I may no longer be able to see at all. I know it mainly affects my left eye and its ludicrous of me to think im going blind . But my right eye seems to continuously become weaker. I have become dependent (excessively so, i.m.o.) on my glasses and contacts. According to my last eye check-up, my right eye now has astigmatism.</P>
<P>I dont like not being perfect.</P>"

<P>it seems like hours went by and im still travelin. right towards the brightness, now this aint heaven or hell, this realm is lifeless. and i hate to say it, but this wild goose chase had me bored. no directions, no clues, and no idea what i was in for. but then forward&nbsp;i kept floatin, and in a quick flash the light split directly in half and created a forks path. representing each side was an angel now whats the task i have to entangle to meet the big man in charge? i asked. and the one to the right of me said, one of us lies and one always tells the truth. ask the right one the right question and hell direct you to heaven. but if you ask the wrong one, son, farewell. youre goin straight to, well, you get the picture. and the one on my left told me not to listen to his fibs, he said it aint that complicated to find out where god lives. he told me to follow his path and tell god he said hi. then the one on my right jumped in and told me not to believe his lies. and im like jesus fucking christ. i didnt care much for life, but i wouldve tried to stay alive forever if i knew this is what death was like. i was never good at problem solving, especially in emergencies. i get a tad bit nervous when concerned with burning for eternity. but anyways i asked them which one lied and they pointed at each other. and thinkin i had it, i asked them the name of my mother. one said he dont know, one said he knows but cant tell me... god damn this is gunna be hard.</P>
<P>and so i asked&nbsp;like&nbsp;thirty questions and i still wasnt sure. then being me, i got pissed and gave them pricks a few good words. frustrated with it all, i turned my back to the angels. and when i walked away, to my surprise, i found myself in heaven.</P>"

heh, i'm <font size=""3"">such</font size> a loser.
Ami will agree with that statement :P






so, yes. i am switching lj's. i've just spent the past couple hours making it pretty and stuff. so i think i'm ready to make the transition. i shall miss this username. i guess? i dunno. i'm tired of it. i've had it since FEBRUARY! *gasp* a grand total of around 10 months! a bit less, but.. whatever. and i'm not on my Sex Pistols kick anymore [""Pretty Vacant"" is the title of my favorite Sex Pistols song, for those who didn't know], and i haven't been for a while. see, that's why you shouldn't make usernames from like, song titles and stuff. oh well.. i do it all the time. so moving on to my 4th lj username lol.. 'tis <lj user= xdreadpirateliz> ..yeah, a little weird but whatever. kind of original, right? more original than my others, i suppose. pirates rock. i made a hot pirate on Halloween. and if you like <i>The Princess Bride</i> then [i'm assuming] you'll get the new name. heh, it makes me laugh :)




yes, so.. add <lj user= xdreadpirateliz> to yo' friends list, bitches!

"event","my iPod is being ..stupid!
actually i think it died x_x
and i think i'm going to die without it.
i am so asking for a new one for Christmas.
i prolly have a better chance of getting it for my birthday, but Christmas is in a little less than 2 months, and my birthday is a little less than 3. yeah, sooner is better lol.

ok, what the fuck? PEOPLE NEED TO GROW UP AND TELL THE TRUTH! i don't know what to believe. and as far as i know, it doesn't involve me. and i don't want to not be friends with someone just because my other friend is mad at that someone. even though i'm angry at that someone too for [supposedly] saying shit about my friend. so, i don't know what's going on. 



HALLOWEEN ROCKED HARDCORE!! 

and i might be switching to a new username soon, but i dunno. i shall let you all know if i do. 


hooray, time to go to school."

but what i hate even more is that i don't feel like there's anyone i can talk to about it who i would feel comfortable knowing about it, and/or who wouldn't judge me. 

i can't even post it [publically] in here, because i would be asked a million questions. a million awkward questions that i couldn't answer without crying and without feeling judged.

that's the phone my dad gave me yesterday. i HEART it. he and Tara got new phones too. but Tara doesn't know it yet cuz her's is a birthday present. but since all three of our phones were eligible for upgrades, my dad just got all 3 at the same time and let me have mine yesterday *woot* he was gonna wait until Christmas to give me mine, but i am oh so glad he didnt. he gave it to me yesterday cuz you only have 30 days to return it and he wanted to make sure it worked and everything. it works just fine lol i havent stopped playing with it. the only things that suck are my ringtones. i only have 2 cool ones. i want to get more because i can give everyone in my phone book their own rings lol. but i dont think i would.. only the people that call me a lot. so if you want your own ring, call me more often lol. and when people call me, if i have a picture of them it'll come up in my caller ID. so yeah, i'll be taking pictures of you lol. 

ok im going to go play with my phone some more :D"

yeah, so i ended up going to the school dance instead of Emily's party. and im glad i did because i had so much FUN last night. Angela is one crazy mofo, but its always a blast hanging out with her. and she actually got me to dance after a while lol. and i realized that it doesn't really matter if i look like a fruit-tart and people think i'm weird when i dance, because if you go to a DANCE and you don't fucking DANCE, then you look like even more of a fruit-tart and people think you're weirder for just standing there. so yeah SON, i shook my ass to some Kanye West! lol and they played Fall Out Boy and ""Party Like A Rockstar"" and some other rockish songs that idr and it made me happy. but they only played two techno songs, and i so wish i had glowsticks!! and Angela was dancing with all the black boys XD and you know how like, someone will be dancing and everyone will notice them and make a circle around them? yeah, well they did that to Angela when she was dancing with Mike and Avery and all them, and it was so funny. they were like ""YEAH, YOU GO WHITE GIRL!"" it was great. and i learned how to do Cotton Eyed Joe. yeah its really easy and idk why i never knew it but yeah lol. and of course the Cha Cha Slide and the Electric Slide.. but no Chicken Dance :( but it's all good. and Ashley danced with Jensen hehe. they're so cute. aaaaaand.. oh, then after the dance we [Ashley, Angela, Kiersten, Kelsey, and i] went out to Friendly's. mmmmm fun times lol. i got home around 11:00 and i was totally dead, so i went to sleep. and now i have to go get dressed because today is my little brother's birthday party. YAY! :P"

"event","Ami, you and i rock hardcore lol. today was great. our plan this morning was to go to the museum right after school. then Angela said she was going to Louie's for pizza after school, so i was like YES let's go i'm starving. so Ami and i went with Angela and Ashley to Louie's and then we were going to go to the museum. THEN we were like, yo.. we don't even really have to be there until our usual time, around 3:30, and it's only 1:00 [we had a half day at school.. hooray for half days!] now, let's bullshit away the next couple hours lol. so we ran like crazy people all through freaking downtown Waterbury.. me looking like a dumbass with my algebra book in hand, and us getting scared that we were gonna get run over, even in the cross walks lol. every time we crossed the street Ami RAN XD and so we went to the costume shop, forgot to go to CVS, went to the CD shop, forgot to go to 7-11, and finally after we had walked around pretty much all of downtown Waterbury and got over to the museum, we decided to just fuck it and totally skip the museum because we had never even told Theresa we were definitely going today, and we went to Toys R Us. oh, but first we got ice cream from the Mr. Softee truck! hellz yeah! strawberry milkshake.. mmmmm. so we walked over to Toys R Us [down fucking steep-ass stairs lol] and hung out in there for a while, playing with all the toys and breaking the pogo stick and almost getting in trouble lol. actually, at this point, i think we were still considering going back to the museum [only to see Ryan lol], but not so much. and after Toys R Us, we really decided fuck it, and walked over to the mall. we stayed there for a while, went to Hot Topic and Spencer's and such, and A PHOTOBOOTH! oooooh yeah! lmao, and my mom called my cell while we were in the photobooth, and me being the genius that i am, i fucking answered it XD but i didn't get in trouble so it's all good. but after the mall, we had to walk back to the museum because Ami didn't want to get in trouble for skipping out on it, and.. yeah. so today was super fun, blowing off the museum and just bullshitting away the WHOLE afternoon [even though we didn't get to see Ryan, so sad!]. we were walking around from like 12:30 to 4:45 dude, it was awesome. you know you're jealous, you should be.

"event","ok i'm torn. well.. not really all that torn.. but yeah, anyways.

so we have this dance on friday that a few of my friends are going to and they want me to come and hang out too. it's only $5 and it sounds alright i guess. but then, today Emily invited me to her birthday party, which is on flipping FRIDAY [yeah, in 2 days!]. i don't have a gift. it's formal and i don't have a dress. and its kind of short notice and ..yeah. and idk who else is going and i dont really want to spend the night alone at her party. but Emily is cool and she seemed to really want me to go. but you'd think if she wanted me to go so bad, she would have asked me, uh, SOONER! like when she invited everyone else like a damn month ago. she was like ""I wanted to invite you before but I didn't think you'd want to go."" and im like, erm, ok then? at the moment i'm leaning towards the dance. cuz it's cheaper XD and its not all formal and such and yeah, its just easier. but i'd feel bad blowing off Emily's party. then again, its not as if she's like, my best friend or anything. she's nice tho. but im still leaning towards the dance. i guess we'll see though. it depends on if i can get a gift and find a dress on time and all that. 

*woot* Aimster and i get to see hot college guy Ryan tomorrow :D and spending 4.5 hours at the museum will be worth it cuz i heart my Aimster and Ryan's cool lol. 




i want to build a time machine and go back to sunday night XD"

"event","i have the coolest friends in the history of forever. i had to go over Shelley's house yesterday after school with Angela to work on our Chemistry project. took us flipping forever [like, 4.5 hours when we only expected it to take about 1.5 or 2], and we probably did it wrong XD but despite our many technical difficulties, i don't think i have ever laughed so much in such a short time before. they are both absolutely <b>crazy</b>, especially Angela. XD i HEART her with all of my heart. 

sigh.. yeah.

erm.. well, i'm going to mi padre's casa today. i was supposed to go last night.. he was supposed to pick me up from Shelley's but apparently it was like a flippin monsoon up in Torrington and the roads were wicked, so Angela's mom brought me home to my mom's and now my dad's gonna pick me up today. he told me to call him when woke up. yeah, well, i've been up since just before 9:00 lol but i wanted to watch SpongeBob, and then i wanted to go online. so yeah, i'll call him in a second, when i'm done with this mess. anyways, i'm going to my dad's today only because i want to see my sister. and i need to see what the fuck is the matter with my camera! Tara JUST took it to the PhotoShop and they said it was fiiiinnneeee. but now it won't work for me again. perhaps it hates me :P hmph.

Ami.. where do you like, live? lol so i can pick you up TOMORROW! *woot* i'll call you tomorrow mmkay? &hearts;

oh yeah, and speaking of that, hah.. apparently Angela's had her tickets for who knows how long. but her sister like, hid them for whatever reason. they came in the mail and the envelope had her mom's name on it, but her sister opened it anyway and like, flippin' hid it under this giant pile of mail and papers. yeah she's pretty mad at her sister right now. if they hadn't thought to make sure that maybe the tickets came and they just like, missed them or something.. then they could have been sitting there the whole freaking time and Angela wouldn't've known and she wouldn't've been able to go. and that would have sucked big moose balls. her sister is strange o_O

Aneta.. i threw my apple away lol. i actually was going to eat it, but it was nasty XD so i threw it out. so disappointing. and did you see <i>Domino</i>?????? I WANT TO SEE THAT!! >_< i <b>heart</b> Kiera!

oooooooooooooooooh!!! yesssssssss! my aunt is getting me Bare Minerals! SWEET! :D

ok well i best be calling my daddy.

and speaking of crazy kids. holy mother.. i had to go up to the 4th effing floor today at school [twice.. not once, twice, and both times from the 1st floor. yeah, i'm too fat for that. and even if i wasn't im pretty sure it would have still sucked balls]. and i had to take pictures of 6th and 7th graders [no offense Raul, because you are an exception and you are cool lol]. the kids in that class were freaking crazy as hell. they were doing e-pals and wanted to send pics along with their emails. so me and this girl Amanda went up to the middle school to take their pictures because we are just oh-so talented. yeah. they were SO LOUD and they were jumping all over the place and they were just so weird. wow.. some of those 6th graders make me think i never ever want kids. geez. x_x

i was supposed to be going to Holy Land with Eugene and his friend tonight, but they're not leaving to go until around 10:00. and seeing as how that's when i'm supposed to be home, i'm pretty sure it's safe to assume that my mom wouldn't let me go and say out until 2am with them lol. oh well. i was kind of looking forward to it because i've never been there, but i admit that it prolly would have been soooo awkward. mmm hmm. but Eugene said that he and his friend usually go out and do other stuff first, like the mall or to a pool hall or something, so i can go with them to that. yup :D

and now i hear that it's supposed to RAIN THIS WEEKEND?? aarrrrrggghhh!! well, it's supposed to be just awful tomorrow but not as bad on Sunday, so we're shooting for that. which means that now Eugene can't go -growl- but is that still ok for you Aneta? it best be!!


omgosh.. i saw freaking Mrs. Signori today in the hall and had a horrible flashback to 7th grade. WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE DOING AT MY SCHOOL??!! ugh.. she's part of what made my 7th grade year such HELL! i really pity the middle schoolers who have her. i really, REALLY do. you don't have her, do you Raul? is she still a major bitch? i bet she is. i'm so glad she's not teaching high school. i disliked her with a <b>passion</b>. and she didn't like me either.

i can't stop shaking and i was crying for 15 minutes. i don't know why i'm so upset, honestly. but i'm freaking out. and i just tried to call Allison, didn't answer.. Alysha didn't answer either. so yeah, i dunno who else to call. and i'm pretty sure that if i did call someone, i'd start crying again as soon as i started talking. 

so here's what happened. it's not gonna be like OMG!! aalakfjajflajflaj.. you know.. but like i said, i really don't understand why i'm so upset. anyways.. so last week, my mom is like, i signed you up for confirmation classes. i glared and whined, but really didn't protest much. i didn't want to upset her and tell her i don't want to be confirmed, because i was sure she'd ask why, and then i'd tell her and she'd fucking.. shank me. gosh. so then i actually forgot about it for a few days, until today when she picked me up from the library and told me we had to go to the class tonight. and i finally was brave enough to ask if i really, <i>truly</i> HAD to get confirmed and shouldn't it be my choice? she said yes i did, and no it wasn't my choice. so.. i shut up. so then we get to the class, and i lost count of how many times they stressed that it's THE TEENAGER'S CHOICE! so i'm sitting there pissed, not even looking at my mom, thinking.. i effing told you soooo! ugh. so then at the end they asked for people to sign up to either help with a mass, a halloween dance, or both. and so my mom asks which one i want to do or if i want to do both. and i said i dont even want to do this class. so she gets the angriest i've seen her in a while and gets up and storms out. she said something nasty on the way to the car, but i didnt hear her. i said i was sorry she was upset, but it's MY CHOICE! why would i want to do that if it means absolutely nothing to me?? so ok, she's wicked pissed so i decide to mope around and leave her alone till she gets over it. i go to take a shower and 2 seconds after i get in, she comes in and is like, i'm going out. i asked her where, and she just said OUT! so i start bawling as soon as the door slams and i can't stop for like, 15 minutes. and like i said, i tried to call Allison but she didnt answer and i left her a message that will prolly scare her. sorry. and neither of Alysha's cells seem to be working and i'm afraid to call her house.

ANYWAYS.. the other reason i'm not going on friday night is because my gramma wants my mom and me to go to NJ for the weekend for like, some festival or faire or something. and Gilly and Moussa (2 kids i met out in CO last month) will be there and i miss them and it'll be cool to hang out with them again *woot woot*

BUT.. that means that <b>Aneta</b>, you and i can't do the doobla feetz :( unless we do it friday? <s>but if we do that, then i'd have to go to your house because my mom is going out on friday and doesn't want me having people over when she's not home. if we do that, i could probably get a ride to your house, but my mom said she doesn't know how long she'll be out, so i guess i'd need a ride home. x_x so i dunno what you wanna do.. 'tis up to you. let me know</s>
[<b>Edit</b>]:ok my mom just told me she's <i>not</i> going out, so if you want to come over on friday, it's cool :D

hey.. i found a skirt in my closet that will go with my costume for halloween. so now i don't need to sew one. and i was thinking about it and a cloak really doesn't make sense for my costume so i guess i don't need to make that either. i'd still like to have one though because they're cool lol. so perhaps i will make one. but yeah, now i just need a hat or a scarf or something for my head and i'll be all set. yup yup.


hey i have a question: anyone ever see the movie <i>Hook</i>?? [if you haven't you're freaking weird and need to see it right now because it rules all] yeah, so does anyone know/remember how they spelled ""bangerang""? was it that? or like.. ""bangorang"".. or something? it's pissing me off cuz idk how to spell it lol. so if anyone knows, that'd be awesome.

k.. homework time. yay."

-friday i went to guidance to see if i could get switched into the photography class i wanted. turns out that class was full, <b>but</b> someone had to switch out of it, and i immediately took her place. *score* so i got to start in the class today. i'm about a week and a half behind lol but since i had a photography class last year in encore, i won't have much trouble catching up. i'm probably actually a little ahead of most of the class. so it's all good.

Kelly better be there tomorrow, damn it. 

-i want a fucking Skeleton Crew hoodie! i can get one if i save my money & don't eat lunch this week or next week XD

Premananda telling us that everyone went to Salida [a town about 45 minutes away] to a movie and dinner. DAMN! lol so we didnt get to say goodbye to anyone, i'm so sad. but hopefully i'll see a lot of people when i go back in December. i really hope you can go Aneta, i want you to so bad lol. and once i show you the pics, you'll REALLY want to go.. though, of course, in December everything will be snow-covered, but it'll prolly be even more beautiful. and since we didn't get to this time, we're prolly gonna go to Colorado Springs next time, so we can see the town i was born in. so that should be cool. yup yup.

""downtown"" is about the size of my thumbnail lol. it's really cute though, very picturesque. is that how you spell picturesque? i have no idea lol. but yes.. i came out here to meet Chalanda Sai Ma. she's a kind of relgious leader that my grandma has been following for a at least 2 years now, i don't remember how long. but yeah, my gramma is totally into her and wanted me to come out here to CO to meet her and go to this youth weekend program. so i did.. it started friday night and ended sunday afternoon. i dont really know what to think about Sai Ma and what she teaches and everything. i expected some crazy hippie people [well, there are a few hippies out here lol but they're ok] or like, a crazy-ass cult or some shit. but it's really not like that. and i thought i was confused before about my religious beliefs? HAH, that was nothing compared to now. i don't know what the fuck to think. all i know is that Sai Ma is not the same as us, there is definitely something different about her, something powerful. and the fact that she's a real person, that i can see her and hear her and touch her.. it just kind of makes all of this slightly more believable. but i dont really know how to explain Sai Ma or her teachings or how she makes me feel. it's something that needs to be experienced in person. but i can definitely say that since spending time with her and talking to her and everything, i am definitely not the same person i was. i definitely want to come back here when Sai Ma is here [she left for France sunday morning]. i think im going to come back maybe for Thanksgiving and def. for that week between Christmas and New Years. i'd come back for all of Christmas vacation, but i want to be there for Leah's real first Christmas. lol last year she was only a few days old, this year will really be her first Christmas. and i cannot miss that. so i want to come back for that, and hopefully there'll be more youth programs next summer. and hopefully the kids that were here for this one will come back because i met some awesome kids. and Aneta, you're coming with me because i really think you'd like it. you'd love it out here and you'd LOVE Sai Ma. and you said that you wanted to try and go to a bunch of different camps and stuff so.. you're coming with me next summer lol. i'll try to call you this week and i can tell you more about it. OH, AND.. almost everyone out here is a vegetarian, so that's a plus right? lol

"event","holy hell.. so yesterday was Warped Tour with Ami. it was so <b>crazy</b>!!! first off, the doors opened at 11:00 but Ami didn't even get to my house till 10:something lol. so she picks me up and we start for the concert and we hit traffic at around exit 16, and we need to get off at exit 19.. so i figured, ok it won't be too long and we won't be <i>that</i> late for the concert, maybe an hour or something. uhm.. no lol. 4 hours we sat in that fucking traffic. we got there at 3:00!! i thought i was gonna go crazy in that car. but ppl going by in the cars had funny signs and stuff lol.. like, ""honk if you like foreskin"" and stuff like that XD we couldn't come up with a good sign, but that's ok. so anyways, we get to the concert at like 3:00 and we've missed Hawthorne Heights, who we both wanted to see, and Atreyu, who Ami wanted to see. so that kind of sucked but, eh. and apparently it rained like a mofo before we got there because the whole place was like one giant mud puddle. it was so hard to walk and i just knew i was going to fall flat on my ass or my face by the end of the day. but i actually didnt lol, though my shoes and pants were <b>filthy</b>, and in the mosh pit Ami got kicked in the face by some idiot crowd surfer and her muddy shoes and got mud <b>everywhere</b> lol. anyways, so we walked around thru the booths and stuff for a while and then decided to go up and watch Story of the Year. we were kind of far away from the stage, but we figured we'd get pushed closer when the idiots started moshing. and we did lol. so when SOTY was over and Fall Out Boy started, we were almost up at the front and i figured by the time MCR came on we'd be up at the rail and just fine. but of course people had to be super STUPID and push Ami and me from every fucking direction and try to squish us to death and then i had to go and get all claustrophobic and dehydrated during ""Sugar, We're Going Down"" and i had to get pulled out because i started puking all over the fucking place. lmao i actually puked on a few people in front of me.. i'm pretty sure they didn't even notice though XD and people were so tightly packed together and i was so squished in the crowd that it took like 3 guys to pull me out. that and the fact that i'm not the skinniest girl in the world lol. but i finally got out and kept puking up my waffles from that morning. then Ami got pulled out cuz i did and she started having breathing problems so they took her to the medical tent-thingy and i followed ..haha and we passed right in front of the freaking stage so Fall Out Boy was close enough for us to reach out and touch them! i was like.. holy fuck!! Ami and i wanted to pull out our cameras lol but she thought the guy escorting her to the medical tent-thingy might get mad lol and she's prolly right. so i think getting sick was worth it just to be so close to Patrick and Pete, even for a few seconds. so we stayed in the medical area for a while because Ami couldn't breathe and she was hyperventilating and stuff. i was fine by then, i felt better after i puked lol. aw but poor Aimster was just so out of it and shaking and.. god i was really worried. XD but you know that when she was sitting there on the cot, i was standing there watching the rest of Fall Out Boy's set cuz we had a clear view of them from there. i kind of felt bad but.. hey, when will i see them again?? lol. yeah, so we stayed there for a while and saw The Transplants, kind of lol. then Ami felt better so we left the medical area and walked around again thru the booths. we found the MCR booth and she got a tank top and i got a hoodie. *woot* my hoodie is awesome.. i just wish it was cold so i could wear it comfortably lol. so we walked around aimlessly for a while till it was time for MCR. but this time we stayed like, right on the edge of the big crowd. i was not gonna go back in that damn mosh pit, fuck no. people were so fucking crazy and i got so scared ::shiver:: so at first we had a clear view of the stage and it was ok even though we were kind of far away. but then assholes started going in front of us [tell me, why didn't we see that coming??!!] and i swear people were getting taller just to spite us and we couldn't see shit lol. i had to jump up and down just to see the stage and poor Ami is shorter than me so she had an even harder time seeing. but i got a cool pic of Frank and Gerard singing. it's far away and they're really small, but if i make it bigger you can see them lol even tho its a little blurry its ok. and Ami got a couple of really awesome pics of Frank that i want copies of!! they were the last to play, and after the show we went and got posters from the MCR booth cuz we didn't want to carry them around all day cuz we knew they'd get ruined. the posters we got are so awesome, 'specially cuz you can NOT find posters fucking anywhere else!! lol so seeing MCR, even from so far away, was definitely worth all of the craziness of the day. they're going on a headlining tour with Alkaline Trio and Reggie and the Full Effect. they're coming to Hartford on Sunday, October 16th. presale tix are only $20!! though, with online fees and shipping and stuff its about $25, but that's still fucking cool as hell. dunno if i can get a presale ticket, i hope so. i know its a sunday and i have school the next day, but i don't care! i am going! though, it says general admission, so that makes me think its like the Webster Theater and there's no seats and i'd have to be in another mosh pit XD i dunno.. i don't think it'd be as crazy as yesterday at Warped. so i'm going. i'll buy my own ticket, even if i can't get presale. i gotta tell Ami and maybe she can come with me. i dont really want to go alone, and i'm sure she'd be pissed if i went without her lol cuz i know i would be. soooo.. yes lol. 

:D my mom has a friend who has a online CD store thingy.. she's gonna ask him to get me Take This To Your Grave and From Under The Cork Tree by Fall Out Boy. i downloaded From Under The Cork Tree but i like to have the actual, real CD and my version of ""Dance, Dance"" sucks and one of the songs is not what the title says it is lol. and i can't find out what song it is! it def. sounds like Fall Out Boy, i <b>know</b> its Fall Out Boy, but yeah i cant find that song anywhere so idk what its really called. mmm hmm..

^_^ i got to hang out with Christian today. <font size=""5"">HAPPY 16TH BIRTHDAY!!</font size> we went to this restaurant in Southington, Sam the Clam's lol it was pretty cool. i'd never even heard of it before. i liked it. i got fish and chips.. mmm.. and all i could think of was <i>Trainspotting</i> lol. yeah if you've seen that movie then you prolly know what i'm talking about and if you haven't, then ..yeah lol. after lunch we were supposed to go mini golfing but of course it had to freaking rain! so then we just went back to Christian's house and played Clue on the computer [haha, that was so awesome, i want it!] and called Aneta but got disconnected :/ and then we took a walk.. and then we watched tv and i got my ass beat at video games [i mean it Christian, if we had been playing Tekken, i would have kicked your ASS, BIATCH!!]. and then we played Scopa. and then.. hah, his dad came downstairs and was like ""come on guys, come have some snacks."" and we're like ok, just a sec cuz we were almost done with the game.. and his dad was like, ""uh, no.. i think <b>right now</b>."" and we're like.. whoaaa, ooook lol. so we go up and they start singing Happy Birthday. but they had a pumpkin pie instead of a cake because they have this thing where if his birthday falls on a weekday then they have pumpkin pie instead of a cake. thought that was a cool little tradition. and i looooove pumpkin pie lol. then we walked over to his neighbor's house and talked to her for a little while and then went back and played more Scopa while watching some nonsense on TV lol and then i had to go home and pack and i finished packing and here i am at the computer lol.

yup, so this will prolly be my last entry for about 2 weeks, 12 days to be exact. i'm leaving for CO tomorrow morning, and i dunno if i'll have internet access while i'm out there. hardly anyone reads this mess, so it's alright lol.

Leah is the only reason to go up there often.. but even so, i don't plan on going back soon. i've had all i can take for a while lol. i did have some fun times this week though. like yesterday we went to the Renaissance Faire up in NY. the only things that made it suck were the heat and the boys were complaining and asking for stuff all fucking day. it was so annoying, i wanted to strangle them. and Frank, Marji, and Danielle were supposed to come, but Marji caught a cold. it would have been so much more fun if they had come. oh well. i wish it didn't cost so much to get in, i want to go back lol. well i'm hopefully getting a job soon. i'll save up for a good costume and go back next year. i want to go with my friends one time. that would rock. oh and Aneta, i had a pickle for you lol. i bought it from this guy who looked like Bam Margera haha. and i got a corset yesterday too. it's absolutely gorgeous. it's silver with a black skulls and flames pattern on it. i should take a pic and post it. and i will. which reminds me, i need to charge my camera tonight so i can use it tomorrow.. cause tomorrow is WARPED TOUR!! i am soooooooooooo frikin excited, holy crap. dunno if i'll be able to sleep tonight lol. and i forgot to get sunscreen. oh well.

yup yup. purty, isn't it? i didn't even have to pay for it haha. i had more than enough money for it, but Tara was with me when i picked it out and she used her AmEx card to get it, which was super nice of her. i saw it and immediately knew that that was what i wanted. i didn't see anything else i wanted, which i found surprising. i went to the faire looking for a pirate hat and boots. i found some, but everything was leather! and i will not wear leather. i feel bad enough that my favorite wallet is leather lol. so i didn't buy a hat or boots :/ i'll have to come up with something else for halloween i guess. or maybe i can find a hat at the halloween costume shop. and i can just wear my crazily-uncomfortable-yet-awesomely-awesome boots lol. and i need a better skirt to go with the corset too if i want to be a pirate. hmm well i have a while yet to find something. 

ANYWAYS.. Warped Tour is tomorrow! with my Aimster! i cannot wait to see MCR!!! i'm gonna die lol. i wanna see Hawthorne Heights and Fall Out Boy too. Fall Out Boy has become one of my favorites. their latest album, ""From Under The Cork Tree"", is flippin' sweet. Hawthorne Heights' album is awesome too.. im listening to it now. *woot* 

well i should prolly go to bed now. it's like 11:something and i missed the Andy Milonakis Show [damn it!] and i have to get up kind of early tomorrow. Ami's not coming to pick me up till after 10:00, but that's early for me!! lol

"event","yes so.. i have been here in torrington at my dad's since saturday night. i can't take much more of this lol. i'm not leaving till sunday after church. i dont even want to go to church! ugh.. oh well. but yesterday was super fun. we went to Burr Pond across town and went swimming and canoeing and stuff. i spent pretty much all day in the water playing with Seth and Caleb. it was awesome at times.. and then you know of course they got on my nerves. just a wee bit lol. but over all the day was good. and then today we went to a cartoon museum in Cheshire. it was flippin' sweet. it wasn't exactly what i had expected it to be, it wasnt like a regular museum. it was this man and his wife's private collection of all kinds of memorabilia. they have stuff ranging from around the 20's and maybe before up to today. and you know how they make those lunch boxes with like all the characters and stuff on them? and how popular they used to be. i guess they aren't so popular anymore.. but anyways.. they have thousands of them. the tour guide said that they're only like 20 short of a full set. and they just have SO MANY THINGS! you could go there 10 times and still not see everything. it was so cool. haha and then we went to Ikea, and i finally got to spend my giftcard that i got for my birthday back in January! it's now August and i only just spent it lol. but i got the comforter that i wanted.. YES! and i had some left over money and there was nothing else that i wanted for $10 or less [cuz thats all i had left], so i got this mirror for my mom that she saw in the catalog and wanted really badly. so.. *woot* happy liz :D so uhmm.. tomorrow we're not doing anything cuz Seth has a counseling appointment ['bout time they got that boy some help] and then there's some roofer guy coming because, well.. the roof needs to be fixed lol. but friday i think we're going to Essex for some train thing and a steam boat thing and some castle thing lol. so that should be interesting. and then saturday we're going to the Renaissance Faire.. yesssss! highlight of the week, definitely. i cant wait.

right well, i finally talked to Alysha. i called her sunday night but she didnt answer so i left a message. she called me back a little while later. so now she's staying in Florida. i have mixed feelings about it that i'm really not going to get into right now. but you would think something that big, something that important.. she might have called the person who is supposedly her best friend, but i dunno.. that's just me i guess. geez. so when she called back i was in the car and it was too loud to hear, so i said i'd call her back when i got home and i did, but she didnt answer lol and i left a message.. but she never called me back again. so i dunno. she's going back to school soon, if she hasn't already. and apparently she's got a job.. i dunno.. i guess so because she said something about how she was working or something. hmm, well.. if she wants to call me back she will. i won't bother her again. 

Aneta were you on today? :( i wasn't home all day [obviously] but if you come on tomorrow then hopefully i can be on when you are. yup yup &hearts;

ahh it's getting really dark in here and i think the light is still broken. i dunno, but i dont have anything else left to say anyways. soooooo.. laters."

"event","yess.. my mom talked to my dad today and he said that we're going to NJ to see baby Randy this weekend!! if everyone is healthy that is. right.. watch us all contract like, frikin pneumonia and shit. gosh. 

so i have $50. and if we stop by my grandparents house while we're in NJ, then i'll get my quarters from my grandpa lol and i'll have around $150 *score!!* and then my mom said she'd give me $50 for my trip to CO. but.. by then i'll prolly have spent most of my money at the Renaissance Faire and at Warped Tour lol. 

yeah ... no one cares lol. but i have nothing else to say so...........


:P 

oh, i downloaded H.I.M.'s new single off of iTunes. i couldnt find it at first because the idiots listed them as Him instead of H.I.M. and Him is a completely different band. but i finally got it!! eeep! i can't wait till the album comes out in September. they're putting out a special limited edition with all kinds of extra stuff and its only available online. it's so cool!! i want that [said like lady in <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i> when Uncle Rico shows her the free miniature ship she can get if she buys his tuperware .. lmfao]

"event","so i'm almost finished with that corset-type-shirt-thing lol. it's........ok lol. it'd prolly be better if i had a sewing machine. but i dunno.. i feel more accomplished that i did that whole thing by hand, bitches! maybe i'll post a pic of the finished product if i'm not too ashamed of it haha. 

yes.. so.. we [dad, tara, seth, caleb, and i] might be going to NJ this weekend to see baby Randall. eeeep!! i hope we do, i can't wait to meet him. the whole frikin family has gone to visit him except us!! i really want to see my new little cousin! i luuurrrve babies :D

aaaaaand.. if we do go to NJ i'm going to call my aunt Beth and ask her if we can stop by because 1.) i'd like to see her too and 2.) my grandpa is weird and saves his spare quarters for me lol. but it's awesome because he always gives me so many quarters.. last time it was like $90!! and he said there's even more this time. and i'm like, shweet!!! so i want to see if we can swing by there and pick up the quarters so i have money for the Renaissance Faire and i can get something nice there for like, the first time ever. i never have money when i go to the Ren Faire.. and it's so much more fun if you have money to spend haha. i want to see if i can find something for halloween. i'm thinkin i want to be a pirate becaue pirates are awesome haha. since i'm making that corset thingy and real corsets at the Ren Faire are uber expensive, i'm just going to look for a hat.. a big one with like, a giant feather and stuff lol. and maybe some boots. both of those are prolly going to be crazy expensive. gosh.. someone needs to do a Faire for the money impaired lol. OOOOH!!! and i want a PICKLE FROM THE PICKLE GUY!! hahaha that guy rules. i wonder if frank and marji were invited to come with us?? that.. would rock so much.

mmmmm hmmm"

"event","*woot* just talked to Aneta. hah, yes i finally remembered to come online to talk to her. i wish i could have thought of more to talk to her about, but we all know how much i suck at keeping up a conversation. oh well. and Christian called me yesterday from Portugal. but i only got to talk to him for like, 2 minutes because he couldn't stay on the line for very long. it's expensive to make international calls. but he's coming home thursday so hopefully i'll get to see him before i go to my dad's next week. 

i have so much to do this week. gotta go thru all my clothes and i have uber laundry to do lol. i'm gonna be away from home for like 3 weeks pretty much. so i should get started on that. after i finish the corset-type-shirt-thing that i'm attempting to make for the Renaissance Faire on the 13th. it's coming out alright so far. hopefully i don't royally fuck it up lol.

my mom and i went to see <i>War of the Worlds</i> yesterday. lol it was my second time seeing it. that movie is so frikin awesome! my mom liked it too, tho she said she was disappointed with the dialogue. she said she thought it was totally lame. i dunno, i thought it was fine. tho, i think i was too busy being scared to notice the dialogue lol. 

yesh.. just downloaded a copy of the new HIM video. sweetness!! :D and Angela sent me the Hawthorne Heights CD. it's awesome!! and i got Fall Out Boy from MusicNet. but i cant burn it to a CD or put it on my iPod.. i'd have to pay to do that. i want the real CD anyways."

"event","so i <b>finally</b> got to see my friends [Ami, Kelly, & Heather] yesterday after not having seen Ami & Kelly since my party over a month ago!! and i hadn't seen Heather since Kelly's party in May.. gosh. but damn, we had sooo much fun! my friends are absolutely crazy lol. the four of us squished into one of those tiny little photo booth things. great pictures lol. i'll have to scan them or something because they are totally priceless. lmfao and Ami and i now have a new uh.. inside joke.. that doesn't need to be shared with <b>anyone</b>! ahh i love my friends.. i'm really glad that i got to hang out with them for a little while last night. *wOOt* and then in a couple weeks it's the Warped Tour!! then school will be starting again soon. XD Ami said she's so bored she actually really wants to go back to school. the boredom really must have gotten to her lol. but it'll be cool to be able to see them more often. my friends are the only reason i can tolerate school. and i am looking forward to my photography classes too. shit i'm gonna be a <b>junior</b>. haha i feel old XD

so my great-grandma's memorial service was scheduled for August 13th. and what's August 13th?? yeah, it's my dad's birthday. so i had to decided whether to spend my dad's birthday with him or go to Mimi's funeral. x_x not easy. BUT.. i didn't really have to decide because my mom e-mailed the family and said that i wouldn't be able to make it that day. and my grandpa wants <b>everyone</b> to be there. the <b>whole family</b>. so *whew* he's rescheduling it for a time when we can all be there. i'm glad i don't have to choose between my dad and Mimi. i felt kind of bad because i was leaning towards staying with my dad because we're going to the Renaissance Faire in NY, the one i LOVE & that i haven't gone to in 2 years. and i felt really shitty choosing a Renaissance Faire over my great-grandmother. i know, i'm such a bad person lol. but it's ok cuz now the date is being changed, thank goodness.

mmm hmm

so still haven't talked to Alysha. why am i surprised? i guess she's got a lot going on and she's just too busy or.. whatever. and i would call her but i figure since she didn't call me like she said she would she's too preoccupied with whatever is going on to talk to me. so i guess i'll just see her when she gets back then. 





and people tell me i'm not self-centered XD"

"event","last night was great. we ventured downtown, stopped for a drink (?), ran into this cool cirque du soleil light show acrobatic thing, and managed to make it to chuys five minutes before closing to get some deluxe chicken enchiladas. i slept yesterday until 2:30 but i managed to go to sleep last night at midnight. i don't know. anyway, this morning we all (minus ben. and jake. so i guess not all of us.) woke up early and had a family day at the j. mom had a meeting afterwards so dad, sarah and i sat in the fitness center lobby and played games online for hours. grabbed some chinese for lunch, then saw nacho libre. so funny. i'm so incredibly tired now but there's still more to do before bed. and sunday starts three weeks of nonstop stuff. i have something going on every day. anyway, shabbat shalom."

"event","sometimes people get really drunk and do embarrassing, shameful things. you don't have to fess up to it immediately, or even ever i suppose; it's not necessary to parade around a group of hung over friends and tell them what happened as if to grab their attention and make you feel like a badass; but there is no need to deny anything either. i'm not proud of a lot of the things i've done while i've been drunk, but i'm not going to hide anything from anyone. i'm not going to deny anything when asked. it happened. so what. you were drunk. you didn't hurt anyone. there's nothing to be angry about. there's nothing to be ashamed about. you weren't being yourself and you just happened to do something that you wouldn't normally do otherwise. it's fine. just drop it, please.

on saturday jake and i dropped my parents off at temple for services and we headed to town lake for a bike ride. the car broke down before we could get there. my mother didn't have her fucking phone turned on and ben and sarah were still sleeping at home, not answering the phone. so we rode our bikes OFF THE HIGHWAY OH GOD HOW SCARY and of course the car had to break down in the hilliest neighborhood. we rode for an hour and a half before we got back to the temple. we were dehydrated and soaking in sweat. it was embarrassing to see people whom i haven't seen in months in such a state of exhaustion and smelliness. and guess what. turns out the gas gauge isn't working properly and all the car needed was some fucking gas! how ridiculous right? at least jacob and i got a good bike ride out of it. my butt still hurts.

"event","last night after running, i sat outside of my apartment on the stairs. the weather was nice. maybe i'm the only one, but there are times when like 50 billion thoughts run through my mind at the same time and i feel like the only way of relieving myself of so many thoughts is to share as many as i can with someone. so i called jake. i don't know WHY because he never answers or returns my calls anymore. thanks for totally sucking. i didn't feel like talking to anyone else. i got really angry. i went inside and sat in my living room in complete darkness forever. it was stupid and i didn't know why i was doing it. but whatever, i was mad, and i get irrational when i'm mad.

this morning/afternoon i had to spend a thousand hours at the doctor's office. they took all these stupid tests and stuck needles inside me for hours. they rubbed gel on my chest. they stuck square things all around my boobs. they injected radiation into me. they made me lie in this ridiculous position on my back for half and hour while this big machine circled my body. i had to run with things attached to me. i even had to get a pregnancy test, what the fuck. two doctors asked me if i was jewish. one of them tried to convert me. he also touched my boob and said it felt unusually firm because he's used to dealing with old women. i know already. i'm 19 and like the only kid my age with high cholesterol. i don't want to have to do this for the rest of my life. 

in other news, i read the alchemist today. good book. and jason and i had a heated debate about judaism and israel while eating dinner. which was from charley's. i was like, whatever, even though i hate jake's guts right now. he was like, what do you want? we're out of salads. and that just made me even more mad. stop making yourself feel like a badass just because you know me. and later i was like, thanks for calling me back, and he's like, i was sleeping. uhh ok, it was fucking 9:30. i didn't make a big deal out of it but i should have. but anyway, the debate was nice. a nice, intelligent conversation for once. that's what i miss about me and jason: in high school that's like all we did. now we just talk about less mature things. evolution. what can you do.

i'm really gonna miss it here.

"event","somber easter sunday. since when do grandkids get money to compensate for their grandmother being sick?

i realized last night that all of the pushing and shoving i've been doing with people for the past few years wasn't a bad thing. it was the only way i could get what i really wanted. i'm just scared now because i actually have found what i wanted, and it wants me back; now what am i supposed to do? i tried denying my current life, pushing it away. it won't budge. it's not something i'm used to. but eventually i will get used to it. there are some times in life when you need to break down and you need to be comforted. i can't always be the rock i think i am. i can't be around for others all the time; i have problems of my own. life has suddenly turned into being not about getting what i want (i obviously already have that); it's about avoiding and getting rid of what i don't want. i have what i've always wanted, i've had it for a long time now, and i'm going to have it whenever i want.

i would like to think that i didn't use any kind of superficial charm to get me where i am. i saw an opportunity arrive and i jumped for it even though i knew that the circumstances under which i accomplished everything were not conventional and would never give me every kind of truth that i seek. i was so mad last night. i was hearing things that made me feel like i was in a fairy tale. i was saying things that made me more vulnerable than i've ever been. so much of what was said was exactly what i've always wanted to hear but i was so angry because fairy tales aren't real. none of that could have possibly been real. i don't know. maybe i'm not quite sure now if i was mad because it was all untrue, that i somehow managed to deceive everyone, that i put those words in her mouth, or if i was mad because it was so true that i could not deny it but i couldn't get to where all of that truth should have led me. 

we stood in the shade of the parking lot. everyone huddled around me listening intently. it made me feel like i'm the only one who hasn't realized how much all of this means to me, how attached i really have grown. everything i said was the truth, but i felt so trapped with secrets that i never dare speak of. it was over as soon as i had started.

i've been so lost lately. i don't pay attention to what i'm doing. today i felt lonely. i found myself in alamo heights, just wandering...trying to figure out how my life was so full of happiness just because i spent my weekends smoking, having sex, and eating out. i'm so ashamed of it, thinking about it now. i tried to imagine what the school year would have been like with aaron still here. everything would have fallen apart eventually. aaron would have been like the kid in the middle of a divorce. shared custody. and even after that, things would have fallen apart even more. i'm weak, i can't deal with goodbyes. i just disappear when i can't handle things. i'm apathetic; i don't care who gets hurt. i just...now, it's like i'm the one who's hurting...and i don't even know if i walked away voluntarily or if someone pushed me out. i'm so fucking different now. i'm trying to protect myself from being hurt again...so i'm just shutting down. learning to rely solely on myself. trust is a lost concept to me. meantime, i'm filled with so much regret for thinking about leaving this place. i've made so much for myself here. i have a good job, a community of people that think well of me, professors that see my abilities and praise me for them....i've made this my home. now i'm just going to pack up and leave as if to say, ""you weren't good enough""?

a few nights ago my uncle had a banana that very grossly resembled a penis. he just had to show it to everyone, with a childish grin on his face that made me think that maybe guys never grow up. anyway, it reminded me of deborah's birthday when, as we were eating birthday cake, harry brought up better-than-sex cake, to which he said, ""just imagine how good it must be if it's better than sex."" and the five of us stood facing each other in the kitchen immersed in a long moment of awkwardness."

"event","monday on our way to dinner for deborah's birthday, jake asked me why i wasn't going back to camp. i don't know what was wrong with me but i felt like we were engaging in conversation like we had just met. i got all nervous...i didn't know what to say and i got all fidgety. i felt like if i said or did the wrong thing everything would go to shit. i'm sure it just has to do with the fact that we were talking about camp. i'm basically just depriving myself of what i really want. i don't know why. maybe i just feel like what i really want never gets me anywhere. i could stay stuck there forever. 

speaking of being stuck forever...it looks like i'm gonna have to stay here and graduate. it makes me feel like a dumbass. i applied to the honors college and i'm thinking of taking up a minor for a little assurance that i'm not that stupid. i don't know where i'm going to live if i stay here because we have to sign a new lease with the apartment by february 15 and i don't want to sign a lease if it turns out that i get into another college...but i don't want to get too ahead of myself. i still really don't know what's going to happen next fall. i'm preparing for both outcomes so i don't disappoint myself too much.

my brother has a girlfriend. she's a high school dropout with no job and no car. he obviously likes her but i couldn't stand to see him kiss her or see her hand on his leg. i had to look away and pretend like they weren't doing that stuff. like with jake. maybe that just means that i know he can do better and i don't want to see him so content with someone who i don't think is right for him. he asked me what i thought of her. ben never cares what anybody thinks about the things he does or whatever, but i knew he was going to ask me what i thought of her. i know it's my fault, too, that he only does that for me because he knows that i have such high expectations for everything and he needs to know from me that he's heading in what i think is the ""right"" direction. i told him i thought she was nice, because she was, i'll give him that. most of those girls he's with totally ignore me. i'm intimidating, yes, but if you can get over that you can get on my good side. i'm glad that he's happy...and at least he has a girlfriend, you know? better than being a man whore.

jason and i ran into jake at the j yesterday since he's working there now. we decided to stop and see mary and harry after class. we went to chili's for dinner. when i ordered a salad jake was like, ""i knew it."" they both know me too well. anyway, after a great time at chili's we went back and jason and i watched the state of the union address with mary and harry. i don't want to go into my opinions of it. it was nice watching it there, though.

1230-145 jake's place. eat the cream cheese/sauce. it was gross. drink the juice. drink a couple of beers. smoke a couple of bowls. laugh on the couch a lot until hayley got too tired to stay any longer. she goes back to my place.
2ish-230ish sit in the shower with jake. like in garden state when they sit in the bathtub. except we don't have tubs. so we sat in the shower.

we did hannukah tonight since my sister and i won't be home for it. my parents bought my brother a thing to put on the floor against the door to keep smells from coming out. ie marijuana. 

tomorrow i'm heading back for a few days. i don't have anything planned anymore because hayley's not coming until friday now. i've gotta go see my grandma and pack. i'm so ready to go back home and sleep in a big comfy bed. if only for that, it would still make going back something to look forward to.

last night ben, sarah and i sat in the bathroom and talked for an hour. i know, of all places, why the bathroom? it's a long story. we had a good time laughing about stupid things we used to do when we were younger. jake was trying to sleep and he kept yelling at us to be quiet. he wears boxer briefs now, it's so cute. he's so little and it's easy to think of him as a play thing...we upset him with our extreme enthusiasm for his cuteness, so he decided to go to sleep. poor guy. he's turning 12 on sunday, it's crazy. 

this morning i was searching out a bowl of healthy cereal...they have so many boxes but not enough of one cereal to fill a bowl. except for raisin bran. so i poured myself a bowl. after i was done eating, i saw a bug in the bowl. gross.

my family got there late. within 30 minutes of our arrival, everyone except my grandmother, aunt, and 6 year old cousin had left to see other relatives. my mom packed up some leftovers and then they left. they didn't even come by my place because my dad wanted to go home and he said there's nothing for them to do here. i drove home feeling empty. lonely. useless. thanksgiving wasn't filled with laughter or happiness or moments with family. we came, we ate, they left, i left. i got home and watched tv all afternoon. i felt like i was waiting for something. i still feel like i'm waiting. everyone's out with whoever it is that they love most. i'm waiting for nothing. i'm here by myself, completely bored and with no one to feel loved by or to give love to. 

and instead of a call from aaron, i got an obnoxious one from his friends. no happy thanksgiving or anything. just an immature couple of guys trying to be funny when all it did was piss me off and embarrass me in front of my grandmother. i'm a jealous, selfish bitch. aaron called jake and not me. if he calls jake i want him to call me. if he doesn't call me i get upset. I'M SO GODDAMN SELFISH. all i want is to be important to someone. i want someone to need me and only me. i'm pissed off that i need people. that i need people more than they need me. i'm pissed off that i can't do shit by myself. i'm pissed off that i center my world around people-pleasing people, loving people, forcing connections between people and every aspect of my life. and i'm pissed off that the only thing i do without selfishness is give head. if i thought about it long enough, i'd probably find a selfish motive behind it.

i'm a total slacker. school is like, MY LIFE, the only thing i've ever been good at, and now i am losing motivation. it's ridiculous. i feel like jake is being more studious than me or jason. i waited til the morning that my last paper was due to write it. i didn't even pull an all-nighter. i went to sleep early and woke up an hour early to pull 8 pages about reality out of my ass. i'm bullshitting as much as i can and honestly i really don't care. nonetheless, she liked the paper, i got an a, so now i'm thinking it's fiiiiiine for me to keep being an idiot about my study habits. for the most part i'm just scared that i'm going to be this way forever. i've never been like this. i've always had to work so hard to do a good job. i still feel accomplished, but...whatever. dropping the subject now.

hayley, becca, and i are going to new york on christmas to spend a few extra days together before israel on the 28th. i want to get FUCKED UP. i want to see all the miraculous things that israel holds and i want to experience a hightened spirituality BUT at night i want to let loose and be a total bitchy slut. HOW FUCKED UP IS THAT. i hate myself right now. problem is, I'M not really disappointed, i could care less, i'm so totally chillin right now and IT'S FUN, but when i think about how my behavior could potentially look to others...it's scary. 

the kids in my hebrew class think that jason and i ""like"" each other. they call him the gingerbread man with the green toe fungus (they're ten year-olds). anywho, one of my kids asked me if we were ""eloping"" this weekend because we're both going to be gone this sunday. ah, kids. it's funny how well jason and i seem to get along in public and somehow manage to keep our frustration for each other in until we are not in a position to be judged by others. but if people saw how mean (read: incompatible) we were, sheesh. 

but fuck, bible study was amazingly fitting to the situation.

thanksgiving: hurry up and get here already. pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes, and kelly levy.

well, like all of the levys, but kelly most of all.

oh, haha, jake borrowed a company truck from The Dad. it has a revolving light on the top. he put it on when we drove to dinner. jake's not just funny because he wants to make people laugh...he's funny because he doesn't know any better. it's just who he is."

SO CUTE. she was like a mini-mom. 

i don't know why i shared that. i probably did it because it was the most exciting thing that happened this week. i had two cancelled classes this week and i slept a lot. went out to eat like every night AND we went to breakfast today. i'm making a B in my history class and it's pissing me off. i wrote the worst paper of my life on sunday. yeah...see how boring that is?

last night i had the worst sleep of my life. i had to go home to see the eye doctor and it sucked. i kept waking up last night. ben was home but he never said anything to me. he just chilled with his friends in his room. i was a little hurt by that but i guess that's just how things go. he's changed. anyway, becca called me drunk and i got mad at her for being so irrational. this afternoon i saw an old friend from work. he and ben decided to come visit me next weekend. hmm, ok. on my way home i stopped in san marcos to see my hottest friend hayley. it was wonderful seeing her for the first time in two months. we didn't do anything exciting but just being with her made it exciting. i'm so jealous of how...normal her college experience seems to be. here i was, thinking that i wanted to do anything but normal, and i'm thinking now that maybe i'm better off doing things like she's doing them. i don't know. oh, and aaron called me. and geoff, too. geez, i've talked to like, all my friends in the past three days. crazy.

this afternoon i drove 30 minutes out of my way to get to my grandma's house because the weather was gorgeous. i drove with the windows down and the perfect music playing...i just drove around town. i love being here. that was the best time i've spent here alone. it was the best thing to bring me at ease. i've been a stubborn bitch lately and i had no intention of stopping before tonight. i'm mad that i'm still happy, if that makes any sense. i expected to be miserable right now. and sometimes we have to suffer to enjoy life, so i set shit up so that it would fuck me over. but it didn't and i got pissed off and tried to avoid happiness. but i can't get rid of it. i suppose that's fine. i have some apologies to make now.

on a different note, i think i've lost my best friend. maybe not for good, but while i'm undergoing a sabbatical from best friendness, i'm still going to be living and learning...if the time comes when that friend comes back, a part of our lives will be lost to each other, so i don't see how things can ever be the same. but i guess that's just evolution. it's inevitable. at different times in our lives, different people mean different things to us. 

i feel like i'm getting busier, but i think the truth is that i'm beginning to waste my time on useless endeavors. or...maybe i'm trying to obtain something i already have, kinda like going in circles, not realizing you're going no where.

"event","things are getting to be more hectic, probably because i'm being more social. i'm not any happier, nor am i less than happy...i'm the same as i was a month ago. two, even three months ago. stable in unstable environments, emotions, actions. able to predict an unpredictable encounter. it's just occurred to me that i've subconsciously conditioned myself to adopt the emotional behaviors of those around me in an attempt to keep everything under control. last night as we ate our chicken nuggets in a nearly empty and cold room our high led to an outpour of unintentioned rationalizations. i wanted more than anything to verbally put meaning and truth behind those rationalizations but i forced myself to hold it all in. am i making sacrifices or am i doing just the opposite and protecting what i have from falling from my grasp? 

expectations. my history professor lectured on them last class. they are what keep me searching...while at the same time bring me down. yeah...back down to earth where i'm supposed to be. i keep searching but i feel as though it's in plain sight yet i can never fully reach it. maybe my expectations aren't compatible with reality."

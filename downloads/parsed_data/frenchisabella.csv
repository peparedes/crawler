you know the ones
the one where i'm like AGGGHHHH why are you being so stupid??? it isnt that hard to carry on a decent conversation. you need not inject little sarcastic remarks, and tell me things that i'd be interested in hearing about only when i stumble upon them!! like, when were you going to tell me that little tidbit?? i had to bring it up about something totally unrelated, and youre all like ""oh, this is what i'm doing""... well thats great for you. ive been working my ass off so we can spend that time together, and youve either made other plans or have already had them made for you, and you don't even bother to bring it up?? i'd be so excited if i were you, and would have told me about it when you heard about it. And no, couldnt think to ask if i'd want to go do. I probably wouldn't be able to... but thats not the point. You didnt know that! Or maybe you did. Anyway, i am completely unimpressed with our conversations today. and yesterday. Why are you being so difficult. 
Its just one of those moods i guess. It started with your automatic disclaimers that youve got a lot to do. Ohhh, im really busy. I'm so busy. I'm gonna be tied up all weekend. Like, you feel the need to start preparing me now to be disappointed, which just makes it worse. Dont just offer up that information all ready. Maybe i was fishing for it, i don't know. Would it fucking kill you to put in some effort?? this isn't going to be a good day. We should just not talk today before i say something not cool. Or before i invite up exboyfriend er something. I don't want to drink tonight. I want to throw myself at schoolwork. Let's see how that turns out. 
Fuck. I'm frusterated.
I hope nobody reads this.
AGGHHHHHH i need to go back to bed and just start today later."

"event","ok so just spent 2 days there at his house
and it was fine
by today i was perfectly comfortable walking around, not needing to be with him every waking moment. i helped his cousin paint her room at his place. i slept in his bed both nights with his pets, while he had to sleep downstairs on a pull out couch haha (mwwaahahaha note: i tell my parents we sleep in the same bed at his place, so he can sleep in the same bed with me here at my house. evil.)
it was fun
i was hardly bitter at all
his cousin is awesome, i am getting to know her better and better, i can see her and i becoming quite good friends, especially next year so it won't have to constantly be me and boys when i go there to hang out. I'll have a female companion to drink with in the city come September. 

Ahh, i had a good time. I did say ""oh you'll be gone for 8 weeks and i won't get to talk to you - right now i'm being so spoiled"" and then, the joker says ""well leave now then""
in typing this now that is moderately funny. worthy of perhaps a chuckle. but i was so tired and it was like 1am, so all i did was get grumpy. sometimes i tolerate his humour, and other times i'm like fuck off, pretend like you like me for just 20 minutes when your family isn't around. And he does. But every once in a while he comes up with his spur of the moment little sarcastic remarks. Anyway, so then i was pissy. And then he was like i'm going to bed, and i was like okay... so i stood up and he proceeded to make fun of my hair and try to touch it and i was like ""don't touch me"" in a way i get with my parents if they're poking me early in the morning because i look tired and grumpy and agitated. I didn't even really realize how bitchy and grumpy it came out. It was kinda vicious. And it seemed to catch him offguard slightly. He was like ""don't touch you? ummm... ok?""

so we went to bed
and in the morning it was fine haha just a bitchy tired moment i suppose.

i am one of those girls who thinks shes low maintainence but is actually very high maintainence. Damn. I never wanted to be one of them. But, apparently it is too late. haha i don't know how to change.

thats all for now

"event","hello darling
how is it that we have not seen each other yet?
i've been busy, i guess. no excuse though
when are you starting work
i don't start til the first week of May sometime.

hmm so visiting him was good. overall. but i'm not going to hold anything back here. he reads the flip side, and i know it - even when theres no replies or entries on his own. i was scared i got a little bitchy there, but i'll let it go here haha

so, i get there, and he randomly goes upstairs or downstairs and just leaves me sitting with his pets and younger siblings/cousins. i know this is what ive wanted for so long, but at the same time, i'm like agh spend time with me, i didn't come up here to hang out with your siblings. especially considering how little we'll see each other over the next few months. it won't be too bad. i never work on sunday, and hes doing classes so i guess saturday nights could be spent together.
but he won't come here. i'm pretty sure hes scared of my mom, she gets kinda annoying i realize. but, i want home court advantage once in a while. theres more to do where he is (i don't even want to say where) and more ppl so tahts fun sometimes, but i'll go crazy if every time i spend the night there its me, and siblings/cousins hanging out, all going to eat and movies and games together as one large cohesive group. I'm sure it won't be that bad. 
And, don't get me wrong, i like doing that sometimes. My lack of a normal family with many close cousins and many siblings makes it seem fun once in a while. the summer has just started so it is fine. I've just gotta take a step back and realize that this is not how it will be all summer. It won't be. I'll get plenty of alone time. If his job works out though, with the traveling and not being able to even call me, that'll be tough. But it'll make next year seem like a piece of cake i guess. 

pffft what am i even complaining about.
i'm so fucking happy
its glorious
i've never felt like i've accomplished something like this. normally i'm like... ohhh if the guy likes me i'll find an excuse to like him. Here, i was like ""you will be mine"" and became an annoying relentless persistant twit... and it worked. haha not saying it works every time. It just took a good little scare. a ""close call"" of me being with someone else. people, even 2 of our friends (one of whom you're fond of, one of whom you're not - i'll tell you later) told me that all it would take is one close call for him to pull his head out of his butt. voila!!! head-removal from anus was successful. hmmm... i'm happy. now, if i only i didn't have to hang out with family when i visit. I'll try to explain sometime in person how weird and out-of-place i feel walking around his place not knowing where he is, pretending not to care. but whatever, i'm a big girl. I can take care of myself in that house. 

ok, enough ranting about me

so, do you and yours talk now that summer is upon us. you mentioned online jokes, whats that about? i'm sure i'll get all the dirt when we finally see each other. Beltide is upon us soon.

"event","well, friend - i have come back
after all the drama that has been happening on the flip side
it is nice to know we've still got this

i might screen your comment from before
just so my regular readers cannot find us here
it would be easy for them to click on your name, click friends, and find me once again
but this refuge here must be kept top-notch secritive in my opinion

it would most likely be quite obvious if they were to stumble upon it themselves
so i want to avoid that
they have already imposed on my once-free lj, and now i want to be selfish and keep this all to me

in other news, i am happier than i've been in... i don't know how long
and the fact that i have an exam tomorrow does not phase me at all

p.s. - i was trying to find a sexy fleur-de-lis but it wasn't happening
so i went with this - it was green when i found it - and warped it in photoshop, to make it a pretty rust color
i can't wait to have a house
my dining room will be ""rust""
but of course i'll think of a more elegant color name... ""wine"" with some explosively descriptive adjective in front of it

forutunately, that is a way off

mmmmm
so happy

stupid exams
although, you're right, it does mean that there are no classes to get up for, which does make for much sexual romping
hmm, what fun

i'm going to stop using the names of before. i will from her on out refer to mine as ""him"" or even just ""mine"" (and 'he', where applicable), and to yours as, simply, ""yours"".

so how is your dealing with the looming months ahead? perhaps yours is choosing not to think about it, and to wish that the rampant sex will merely continue blissfully for the next 4 months? it is very easy to do. To just not think about it, i mean. Mine has barely mentioned it. Not as though he will be that far away. Cause hes not. But mine will most likely require me to be doing most of the visiting. I'm not even going to say the place - too obvious... I'm paranoid. And rightfully so. haha

ok, i must must must study

see you soon!

so how are you? i have fought my way through the computer line and now i have about 10 minutes to have a little conversation with myself. I am thinking that you are either heading to california soon if you are not in fact currently there. I'm sure you've managed to charm your higher-ups at work to allow you to do so ;)

I am so happy that i am so close to being home. I like this place, but i'm sick of it at the same time. I am looking forward to driving a motorcycle. I told mummy tonight on the phone that there should be some beer and a motorcycle waiting for my return to Canada. To be enjoyed separately, of course.

The people here are great, but still, it's no comparison to home. And it is weird dealing with the multitude of accents that I have to interpret in the run of a day. There are so many people from so many different places. Within the USA alone, there are many many different twangs that are worked into the conversation. And my little angels in my bunk are the first to point it out when i say something ""weird""...

What the hell do you call a place that your family owns, and its not your house but its not too far from your house, and you go there for weekends occaisionly throughout the year, but mostly in the summer? Maybe it is shared by your whole family or maybe it is just your immediate family that shares this place... But, NORMALLY i would call that a Cottage. Wouldn't you? Oh no - these jappy little girls mocked me for what seemed to be an hour and clarified that it was indeed called a ""summer house"" or a ""weekend retreat"" Fuck. It is a COTTAGE for God's sake. They envision a shack when i say cottage. Not a place where there is a maid that brings your virgin shirley temples whenever you please!!

Oh, and please note that the term ""jappy"" is not a racial slur. It is in fact a form of the acronym (spelling?) of ""J.A.P."", which stands for Jewish American Princess. Thats all these girls are.

I do like this place though. It is ok. And i talked to our good friend today. We do not have a name for him. I will call him FiFi'sLove. FiFi'sLove (FFL for short) is so cute sometimes, it makes me wonder why i haven't made like fi fi and actually fell for the guy. That would make my friendship with him truely fail, as i know it is based on solely platoic vibes, which is why it works so well. He knows i like hubert or herbert (whatever! i've used them interchanagably) and we all know that he does not go for the ones like me. and we all know what ffl is like. Anyhow, ffl was being so nice today, and he told me to write him an e-mail. So i'll get around to that sometime tomorrow when my internet time is not up. 

alright hunny, i must go now, i can feel people cutting holes through my screen with their eyes trying to see what i'm doing, and trying to will me with their death threats to get off the computer!

I hope they read that. heh

miss you! i can't wait to see you when i get home :)

love always
*izzy*

P.S. - there is a little girl named isabella at camp and she is exactly the opposite of what i picture any young girl named isabella to be. She is fat and ungraceful and weird. Not at all pretty or intelligent or alluring. She makes me want to cry because she has completely destroyed the name. But thats ok. it is not her fault. shes only like 7, i'm sure she'll grow to fit the meaning of the name. ciao!"

i went to NYC and was thoroughly disappointed with my lack of purchases when everything was added up. I bought: one fabulous lunch at TGI Friday's, a great supper at a little chinese food place, and one absolutely fabulous book at Barnes & Noble.

Actually, i take it back. My puchases were amazing. The best food i've had in weeks and the most interesting book I think I'll ever read. The book was $6.97. And it's called The Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex.

So far, I've only read the introduction, but the very second I saw it on the shelf on 5th Avenue I thought of you and I and our conversations. Hehe its so great, and I'll let you read it when i get home. In the into it said that the book would give each reader a set of personal mantra's to repeat daily, and I can't recall it right now, as its too embarassing to bring the book with me to the computer lounge. Not to mention that all my girls would see it and freak out. 

Tonight we're hosting a social for my girls' age group with this boys camp called Greylock. And the counselors are hot. Maybe i'll test out some of my bad girl sex techniques. I flipped through the book and there are literally exercises that it gets the readers to do, and one of the ones I saw was ""The Panty Flick"" heehee i can't wait to read it hahaha

anyhow, this is all the time i have for now, i'll talk to you soon hunny!

ok, theres this way for parents to e-mail campers and look at camp pictures... so the staff have access to this e-mailing thing as well

so i told my mom how to e-mail me and the e-mails are printed off every single day and given to all the campers. And up to this point i have only ever received e-mails from my mummy. but then some mail staff member sends me the following e-mail - i will re-type the whole thing....


I know it is a little junior high but i figure that you are used to junior high by now. Also, I am too much of a coward to tell you this in person so I am writing you this letter.

I am writing to tell you that I think you are an amazing woman. When I look at you, I feel warm and happy inside. I do not know what it is. Could it be your smile that lights up any room? Or, maybe it is the way your eyes sparkle and laugh when you talk. I only wish that the summer were longer so I could get to know you better. The intention of this letter is not to ask you out or to ask for a deeper relationship. If all this letter does is put a smile on your beautiful face, it will have served its purpose (plus i know how cool it is to get mail at camp) All I ask of you is that you keep your sense of humor with your girls and keep smiling.

If i were to sign this letter, it might make this weird and defeat the purpose of the letter. So I won't. Enjoy the rest of your summer.


So thats it. Its nice and sweet but there is one thing - i honestly don't know how it is. I think i tmight be this guy, brendan, but i hope its not!! Hes old and fat-ish and really touchy-feeley. I thought he was that way with everyone, but thats my only guess as to who it may be.

I love you so much and I miss you!!
I have to get off the computer now, but i'll talk to ya later hunny!!

It's been a while, no?

So, what is this about being an ""age snob""? I wouldn't go around feeling guilty about showing these 6 lucky men at work what the real world is like. Unless they're like 15, then go for it! hahaha I say the not feeling bad about playing games should start here and now. Especially here in the USA. 

There are actually a few half decent guys here at camp. But none of them are interesting me at all. Honestly, I don't even really look at them. And my 13 13 year old girls are always quizzing me on who I think is hot. And although I'll admit to who is attractive and everything like that, I simply can not think about anyone else. Only Herbert. *sigh* oh, herbert... teehee i love the name. 

well, i have been thinking about writing you a real letter so much I cannot recall if I actually did. I've started a letter to you on two different occaisions, but i threw them out thinking that i've already said the same stuff in a first letter in the first week. Bout you would have probably got it by now. So i'm not sure if i sent it or not.


heh, and when I read ""The Voice"" i started laughing out loud, and i'm in the staff room and people were wondering what the hell i was reading. That is the most appropriate name. Even better than herbert. And The Voice has admitted to me that he thinks that you are naturally good at sex. Thats quite a compliment coming from The Voice, because he is sure that he is God's Gift. I can't really deny or confirm that The Voice was sent to Earth to please women everywhere, but from what he says he seems to know what he's talking about.

Glad to hear the writing is progressing, and I find myself wishing I were as ""deep"" as you seem to be. I'm actually quite plain. I don't think I have layers that could come out from writing. Although, i absolutely adore writing in my journal. And i continue to do so everyday. 

Alright, still in the staff room, and i need to go as there is a line forming.

ohh i am so so so happy right now, and if you've read my other post you'll know why

i very optimistically sent an e-mail to hubert and hubert, as we know, was likely not expected  to write me back. I have been thinking about it quite often. I have been able to cut myself from checking my e-mail every few hours, just telling myself - depending on my mood - that either A) he didn't get it yet, or B) he got it but feels uber uncomfortable and decided not to write back. So. This leads me to now when i came home from a long day at work and look at MSN and it says 7 new messages! AND i knew it i knew it one was from hubert

ahhhh i am so happy

a simple two sentences have given me some sort of... i dunno, hope? thats not really the word i'm looking for, but you know what i mean. 

i hate the internet because you really don't know how the person is talking. Theres not much to artistically analyzing 2 very short sentences... but i don't want myself to be too optimistic...

GAH

i don't care, i'm happy just the same. Just the fact that he wrote back is nice. 

Wow, i need a life.

sure, that would be good.
what did you want to do?

no introduction
no closure. Oh, how hubert of him. No closure. But what do i want to do? I know what i want to do, you know what i want to do, but does HE know what i want to do?? Hes a boy. Most likely not. Or, better question, does he want me wanting to do what it is i want to do?

Thats confusing. But, bottom line, what i want is him. in bed. or not even. just him. to be mine. oh wouldn't i kick myself in the ass for going to camp if i allow myself to fallllll for him alll over again. In fact, i don't think i ever unfell in love with hubert. or lust. or whatever you want to call it.

i just want him to be mine, and me to be his. Hes not with anyone else (i don't think, who would be so stupid besides me?) and i'm sure as hell not with anyone else, so what the fuck is the problem?!??

alright, melantha, if you know what hubert will want to hear in my reply to this ""what did you want to do"" question, then let me know.



i'm now thinking about the whole basis of this post. Such an innocent question. One friend saying, ""I'm leaving, wanna hang out ebfore i go"" and then a reply ""what do ya wanna do?""

typical every conversation.

why can't i let it be typical every conversation?!?

i would say too much history, but theres honestly not THAT much history.

i'm gonna go now before i confuse myself and you anymore

i love not editing myself, its great

This time, it is for you and i alone. I agree that if someone should happen to stumble upon this, they should not know who we are, where we're from... only that we're uncurable sex goddesses...

that said, why don't we take our other accounts off of THIS accounts ""friends list"" so that nobody can link here from our other accounts. Does that make sense? It does in my head.

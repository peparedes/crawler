i dont write anymore, i probably should though. i mean i do write, alot, just not here. i guess i feel more comfortable writing in a more private place? yeah. still the sam-old-boaring shy Juanita :) so anyways, i think the last time i wrote was innnnnnn.. August? wow.. alots happend. Inside scoop: well, i moved. im now in South Yarmouth, righ by D-Y. the house is nice, i like it.. but im gunna have to move again next year for college anyways. this is the 5 time ive moved since i been at sturgis/highschool..5 houses in 4 years,you do the math. i been spending alota time working..as always.. but im actually leaving the job i love. i cant stand my ""boss"" anymore. i love what i do and i hate to say goodbye to all the kids and parents and stuff, cuz they're really wonderful, but i gotta do it. and theres the fact i only get paid every 2 weeks.. whcih blows, alot. so yeah, time to move on. Ummm.. i started painting a mural :) its comming along nicely. i stay every wednesday after school for 2 hours. its very relaxing and good for me for multiple reasons. ONE: it gives me time to do something i love on a bigger level and show people apart of me with out having to explain myself all the time. i dont need to tell people who I THINK I AM. Secondly: it gets me away from my crazy house-hold for a few hours, and for once i can spend time doing something i love to do. dont get me wrong, i love my family, but sometimes, you'd never be able to tell..

So yeah, i love Peter. Halloween will be our 1 year :) im excited, not only cuz its one of my favorite holidays, but because this is my longest relationship and there are no signes of separation anytime soon. hes so good to me, i must have done something right for once i guess :) i only get to see him once a week though :( its usually.. i drive to Lowell, Pick him up from work at 9:30pm and then go to his house and hang out and then we fall asleep and then i bring him to work the next morning, not much, but its enough to get me through. there are a few times that we get to spend like a day or so together. cuz we take time off work and stuff.. like halloween weekend :) hes gunna come to the cape and help out with my halloween party (PS..come if you wanna :) ). Ugh, i love him so much :) but, i missed homecomming cuz if it :( it was last night, and the only one ive missed since highschool (4 years). thats okay tho, there will be other dances and stuff i'll go to to see all my harwich buddies :)

Well.. i need to go clean.. im gunna TRY to write back soon. no promises.

Love Ja,

i really need to start writing again.
anywho, so lets start with.. i picked up another job.. its just until labor day. i work on a pirate boat, its so fun! but i got wicked bad sunburn..again. thats like 13/14 this summer alone, i think thats a record for me :P OK and thennnn.. pete came down for a few days. We went on the duck mobile, to the beach <3, mall and the drive in :) he's so sweet and good to me. i love it. i work like everyday now pulling 11 to 15 hour days so its gunna be hard to see him this week. im probably goin up to Lowell on Wed after work and comin back thursday morning intime for me to go to work at 9am. umm..

my summers goin ""okay"". havent done much besides work and do college crap. i got back to school on Aug 31st and i think college apps are due in in like November or late fall/winter. idk. but yeah.. i'm lookin into Humbolt University in Arcada,California..cant tell i wanna get away from here can ya? and then i looked into one in Chico,CA and Rahnert Park,CA. i looked into Leslie, in boston. and one in CT. other then that.. everything else is on the west coast. Pete really wants me to go to a school in the Mass new-england area, cuz he says he cant do the long distance thing. and i feel really bad cuz i was talking to Catherine (his mom) about College in CA and i was so excited and he heared everything and i made him sad. but after words hes like ""i want you to be happy though. but id miss you"" it was really sweet. we'll see how things go i guess.

on the 12th of August i went to a memory thing for Jameson :( (my ex. boyfriend who was like one of my best friends, who died last summer).. i didnt get to go to his funeral last summer so it was really important i go to this. there was a blown up picture of him and me, and when i looked at it, i just lost it. After that i went to petes house and we went bowling and stuff. hes so good to me, he kept tryign to make me laugh and feel better. its nice to kno i have someone like Peter in my life. petes ex Megans been IMing me and telling me all thi bogus shit. like pete wants to break up with me and has wanted to for a while, and how he asked her out and all these other girls and all this BS. ofcourse i dont believe her. If pete wanted to break up with me, he woulda done it months ago..we woudlnt last 10months already if that was the case. PLUS ive asked if he wants to break up before and i always get the same ""no"" answer. As for the girls he ""asked out"" i talked to them. Megan said pete asked out Holly,Emily,Caddie and someone else. i IMed holly and she was like ""yeah pete asked me out..in freshmen year! and as for Emily.. she asked him out..last year..as a joke"". so i dunno wtf Megans problem is. Pete seems to think she's jealous of me. but she doesnt kno me. idk, maybe cuz petes  happy? who knows. but i hate ex gf's and bf's who cant stay outa peoples buisness.

ok.. well, im not feeling to good and i gotta work at 4today so im gunna go ""rest"" untill like 2 when i need to brng Chris to his eye appt.

Andrews in Cali and i got a really good shot of getting into all 3 college in CA, and they all accept the IB, which is the program at Strugis im taken and i might only have to do 3years instead of 4 cuz id be skippin freshmen year. idk, but everyone i love (mostly) is here in New England. Rellie leaves in 2 years when shes done with School and then moms gone and rels gunna be gone too. idk.. theres just alot to concider and i dunno what to do. ive been to a few shows this summer.. im goin to a few more between now and then end of the month. petes gunna be here next week too :) i havent talked to andrew in what seems like forever. Right now im babysiting my 16 and 13 year old cousins.. yeah its sad, i kno. I start painting my mural on tuesday!! :) and then  Billys coming to the cape for a week so i get to see him, which is awesome! i havent hung out with nearly anyone all summer cuz i been to busy.. but hopefully my shedual is clearing up and i'll have time. school starts back up on the 31st of August..eww. well im off.. gunna go watch Scary Movie 2 with Allie and go walk Zeus (the dog) and feed Barret and Dizzy (cats) and all that good jazz. i'll try and write back, not that anyone reads this anyways.."

Moving on with the rest of the month:

What else? umm.. Unkies a moron, Genas a bitch. what more is there to say? Gena needs help.. seriously. Friggin tellin people shit that no way is true, and unkies a moron for staying with her. I love my uncle to dealth, but hes being an ass.. i dont think he liked me much when i told him that. and i respect Gena cuz shes my boss and uncles girl, but this shit needs to stop, seriously.

okay now we're up to April:
Yesterday was Petes 18th bday. he invited me to go out with him and his family. we went to Nashua, New Hampshire. it was great. Me and Layla (his cousin) had some fun. lol shes one funny little lady. it was a kool night.. then we went back to his house, got home around 10ish. me and him watch -Scary Movie 3- cuz i have yet to see it all the way through.. i ended up falling alseep at like 1 (so actually 2 ..day light savings sucks) SO I STILL DIDNT SEE THE WHOLE MOVIE! GER! anyways..we went to bed and i had to leave around 9:30 to get back to the cape to get mom from Daphs on time and be to work at 2. but now i dont need to go to work, so im gunna go clean my hell hole of a room :)

wow its been a few days since my last actual entry.
All last week i was sick. like, VERY sick. i couldnt move, breathe, eat, nothing. i so hate being sick. i missed all of school and all of work. so i dont get a check this week. which blows greatly. and to top of the oh so wonderful week.. this week is the same! wo! talk about excitement!

Monday: got all my makeup work from school. BSed my way through something in english.. which i totaly do all the time cuz im just good like that. come to find out grades close today.. so i had 3 days to make up 6 tests and 2 labs. amazingly enough.. i did it. lol. Mr Marble` kinda fliped on me tho cuz i missed a whole week of school.. omg! not 5 days! im sorry if i was close to death.. next time i'll just come and infect everyone! :)

then went to work. Steph and Debbie took pitty on me and let me leave early and do the least amount of work.. cuz i  still felt like shit.. and apparently i looked it to. lol..such lovely co-workers i have!



Tuesday (yesterda). went to school. thats a given cuz after that bet with Marbale` psh.. im goin to school dammit! cept for the 5 days i told him id be missin in May. so then i get outa school.. go make copies of stuff and head to lowell to give Peter his stuff he needed for prom. however, on the way to Lowell, my box died :( the heatercor totally blew out and my car smoked and steamed up like mofo. mean while, im on the highway..in the hammer lane! i almost got killed. its a good thing i dont pannic! so i pulled of the side..called mom. mom called unkie.. unkie called auntie. so im waiting for someone to come get me. haha all 3 of them came.. in different cars. lol so we had 4 cars pulled off on the side of the road. quite funny cuz we had people stop and ask if it was an accedent and if we were ok. lol. anywho.. so i take moms van and go to lowell. mom drives the box home. she made it to exit 9A and it totally just died. and we live at exit 9B. it was a very long day :(

adn today: school adn work. lol. thats about it..oh! and i wrote a letter to Kyle. even tho im still very pissed at him.

I went to lowell to pick up peter <3 and then brought him back to the Cape. we went to the movies with Mel, Chex, Erin, and D'dave. we saw -Hitch- such a funny movie! haha. then we went to walk around the mall and saw spencer and some other people from sturgis and what not. i was on my way to Debbies Petland to see Elsa to introduce Peter to her.. well get this.. SAPOSIDLY im in the hospital! lol. 
As im rounding the corner to go to Debbies Petland Elsa calls my cell phone and shes like ""where are you?"" im like.. the mall. and shes like ""get outa there right now! abort! abort!"" haha and so i asked why and shes like "" i had to tell work you were in the hospital other wise i couldnt get today off work to come to yer dinner tonight! get outa there!"" haha it was quite ammusing.
so then 7 o'night comes around and its time for Dinner with the Fam at Sam Diagos = BEST RESTERAUNT EVA! my early bday dinner was there. we had lost of people go.. there was.. me mom rel peter nicole linda ally allie gabe nick daph unkie gena elsa jarred and phllip. i finally got to have my FRIED ICE CREAM! that stuff rocks! :)
i introduced Peter to everyone. they all seemed to like him. wich is totally awesome! I let some people get picks of me.. which is VERY rare.. but awesome. elsa wanted to steal to parrot from outside.. if it wasnt coverd in snow.. i would have. lol.

Sunday: layed in bed till like 11:30 when peter forced me up. lol. then sat around and watched TV and let him use my computer. then me and him got ready and went out to go bowling.. but all the alys for 10pin were taken. so then we drove around.. i showed him my POS school. he didnt believe me when i told him it was small and an old warehouse.. well he did after.lol and for some reason the school was unlocked on sunday.. so we went in and i showed him around. then we went to the billiards hall.. i totally kicked his ass in pool! but he played a good game. so then after that we came home and got his stuff and ready to bring him home.. i fell in the snow ...twice! haha from my house door to my car like 30 ft away! lol..  so i brought Peter home and then just hung out there for an hour or so and finally came home.

rellie got me a digi camra for my bday. she gave it to me today! :)
funny story tho.. she bough the display box cuz the BLONDE that sold it to her grabbed the display box rather then the last actual camra and printer.. so moms gunna bring it back and exchange it tomorrow! *plots revenge on chex*

i opened it and Gabe comes in (cuz hes stayin the night tonight)and is like ""i think somethings missing"" and im like ""yeah the camra and printer!"" it was funny. but i got some BUBBLE WRAP! <3

i worked an 11hour shift today at the raquetteball club.
-i worked in the playroom from 8am-noon.
-i worked at the front desk from noon-3:45 answering phones and stuff cuz they were low on staff and asked if could because they looked at my app from like 2 years ago and i used to answer phones for the local railroad company. so i did that
-and then i worked my normal monday shift from 4-7ish BACK in the Playroom.
it wasnt ~too~ bad. mondays are always busy so i didnt expect much to change. the morning was worse because we had alot of babies or..kids under 3years old.
and in the afternoon..kids were louder and more rambunctious and i got dodged into by like 6 kids. im really short, so most of um went to my waiste.

im tired.
im gone.

Begin, present, fade out,
Judgement please don't fail me now,
This time, this time
A lesson learned is a picture burned,
You're a memory to me,
Upon ignition come bear witness to the greatest therapy,
Just begin, present, fade out,
Judgement please don't fail me now,
This time
That was the day I put your picture aside.
Swallowed the fact that our dream had died.

Karen came to see me! i miss her so much. we wernt to busy.. but it was a goodnight. then after work i came home for a bit and then went to pick up rel from nates house and then went to hy-town to get elsa. then came home and finished makeing peters present :) haha i made him this blanket thing.. one sides spiderman (cuz hes a geek and likes that kinda stuff) and the other sides shamrocks. i did like a forth of 8th of it thursday at work cuz it was slow.. so i finished it last night and made a pillow. it took me 6hrs to do it. i poked so many holes in my hands becuz i did it by hand cuz the machine isnt working.

Saturday: Picked rel up from work, then came home. then me and elsa went to clean out my car, and pick up my checks cuz i didnt get um friday like i usualy do. then i brought Elsa to Sams and headed for Lowell.
picked up peter from work at 5, and then went back to his house. i gave him his stuff, he really liked it :) and then he was telling me all week he felt bad he didnt have anything for me and im always making him stuff and everything he gives me he buys, which i dont mind. but he does. i told him i didnt want anything.. but he insisted anyways.
He Made me this pasta dinner (cuz he knows im Italian)..he bought me flowers and chocolate, and he rented my all time favorite movie for us to watch.. it was wonderful <3 it made me very happy. i ended up falling asleep on the couch and his mom came in the living room and shes like ""are you goin home Juanita, cuz yer welcome to stay.. you look tired hun"". i told her i had planed on goin home and i didnt have a change of clothes. Peters like ""aww, baby,stay"" and he went in his room and brought out a t-shirt and pj pants for me to sleep in. i love that kid. so i slept there and then this morning he woke me up with a Kiss...granted it was 5am and i wanted to kill him.. but still it was nice. and then he layed down with me and we went back to sleep.

"event","<P>ok. Update:</P>
<P>Midterms were last week. i servived. i deffinately passed them all, i'm not sure as to how well though. Top grades are probably in my English,Latin and Art class. worst grade is probably Physics. but Mr Paterson honestly hates me, so who knows. i could have aced it and still will fail miserably.</P>
<P>For the past week or so i havent really been myself. i dunno whats going on. i'm getting no sleep, which is worse then my 2 or less hours every two days :( i'm dropping weight way to fast, im constantly working.I havent really had any time to myself or to even breathe lately.</P>
<P>The past few days have been *gerr*. everyones mad at me for something. and i had almost forgotten why i dont like people. I'm the one whos always expected to help people. and no one ever returns the favor. i dont usually care. cuz i can usually help myself, but when i seriously need help, no ones around. And the few people who could help.. are either to far away and i havent talked to them in a while, or dead.</P>
<P>i find myself missing a few select people more so then usual lately.<BR><STRONG>Jameson</STRONG>, may he rest in peace, has been in my dreams alot lately.<BR><STRONG>Mark</STRONG>.. Well, Elsa openend a journal for all of his friends to say goodbyes and write memories and stuff. i was the first to write in it. i miss him alot. he was always there to help me.</P>
<P><STRONG>Connor</STRONG>. i live in the same damn town he does and i dont ever see him. we never hang out anymore and it really sucks. we never, or,<STRONG> I</STRONG> never have time when he does. i hate it.&nbsp; i dont see any of my friends now. i'm becoming a hurmet :( i do the same shit day in and day out.</P>
<P>my beloved <STRONG>Andrew</STRONG>-my best friend, lives in fuckin CALIFORNIA! theres a heartbreaker right there. lately hes been busy, and ive been busy. he seems to be a little different lately but its probably just him being tired. i love him, he means so much to me. he kinda seems to be mad at me for some reason, perhaps cuz i'm with Peter and not him.even tho i kno he respects my choices and he knows in the end its very possible we'll be together,idk. he doesnt mind what i talk about, it can be anything and hes always there for me, like i was there for&nbsp;the him and laura thing.&nbsp;me and peter are alot like him and laura..u always want what you cant have.I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;much to be with him when he was with Laura and now he wants me now that I'm with Peter. its complecated. but no matter what we are, me and him, its&nbsp;great, and we make our friendship work,id be so much more lost with out him..&nbsp;and its hard keeping in touch, and we do our best. but over xmas break we were together 24-7! every wakeing moment basically. i hadnt seen him in SOOOO long. a week wasnt enough time to catch up on everything...usually i'm a very patient person but i really cant wait till summer gets here. so i can go see him again.</P>
<P><STRONG>Peter &lt;3</STRONG>: all i can say is..long distance relationships suck.. i'm on the cape, hes in Lowell.it could be worse, but still. i only see him once a week for like 3 or 4 hours,except for the occasional snow-in, which i doubt will be happening much more this year.in which case i spend days with him, but then come home and miss him so much more. hes comming to the Cape for the day/night February 26th. we're gunna celebrate my bday early cuz i wont see him that week..but i'll be with him on his bday. </P>
<P><STRONG>Alicia,B,Chris</STRONG>-Alicia come to the cape everynow and then. but she comes to see Nicole. and its always when i'm either away or have other plans that i cant back out on. B..i dunno. hes on cape alot but i'm always the last to hear about it.and when i can hang out with him.. hes just leaving. Chris is here every other week. and again, time is an issue.</P>
<P>Lastly, i miss <STRONG>Matt</STRONG>.. i really cant explain what i'm thinking now, but if i told him, he'd probably know. hes one of like 3, who can understand the way my brain functions. its kinda scary. He was talking about one of his ex's last night, and for some reason i got jealous. i have no idea why, cuz yeah, i used to like him, and hes a great guy. but i gave up on him a long long time ago. cuz i never had a shot, even tho he thought i might. so i dont kno whats goin on there!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>i dunno.. lately is either everyones slipping away from me and i'm slowly faiding or just people are beginning to hate me more and more. i just gont get it.</P>
<P>Friday: No school.. didnt have a midterm for art cuz i finished my ""project""early..Mrs Lee is so effing retarded.i went out to brunch with Mumsie and Linda. i got a WaterDragon! :)hes adorable. his name is Causmoe (~cosmo~ yeah, i'm&nbsp;famous for spelling names differently. its that whole..~unique~ thing.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Saturday: ran a whole bunch of errands and then went to see Peter. Picked him up from work at 5 and then went to his place and watched some movies. he asked me to draw him a picture, so i did, and i put it in the book i made him for xmas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday (today): worked. and now im about to go clean my room, and Draeke, Leraido,Myloes (my birds) cages. and do some laundry and such.</P>
<P>School tomorrow *oh joy!* (sarcasm).. i'm gunna have to listen to everyone Yack about the gay-superbowl. i'm probably the only person who hasnt watched ANY of it tonight. i dont see the point in it really.. you can see it every weekend on TV, whys it such a HUGE deal? tell you one thing tho... if the eagles win, i'm gunna laugh in some peoples faces like you wouldnt believe!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>i'm done,</P>

it was the first day back to school in a week. lol. it was good i guess. i started off having a shitty morning. Rellie woke up and instantly started bitching. then i slid on a patch of ice and landed flat on my fucking back. not good. mid terms start tomorrow. gerrness. i got English and Latin tomorrow. not a big deal, especially for english. Latin i had to do a tad bit o' studying, but nothing drastic. Look over declentions and gerruns and gerrundives and all that fancy shmancy latin lingo.

work was good. i was at the play room. we only had 3 kids today. Grace, Emma,and Hannah. three cutest little gals you'll ever see. i just love Gracey. shes addorable. her moms so nice to. haha Me and Hannah were dancin around and Shelly, from the front desk, saw me and shes like..aww Juanita<3 lol.

i locked my keys in my car for the first time. haha unkie came and got um out for me.*yay* then i came home and studied, cleaned and all that good stuff..

Elsa opended a journal for Mark.
I miss him.
she made a journal so that people could say goodbye to him. i was the first one to write in it. theres a huge long thing i wrote to him. i miss him so much. he was an awesome friend <3

"event","i hate people.
its amazing how you think you're good friends with someone and then they turn on you. or you think you kno them well enough, but it turns out you're way off.

so what if i dont smoke, drink, drug, and im still a fucking virgin. thats my buisness! im happy knowing all that. i dont need to be another part of a teenage statistic. im perfectly happy knowing i dont fit in with the ""in crowd"" and if it bothers people, then they shouldnt pay any attention to me and what i do and or dont do. i dont need all that shit, ive had enough go on in my life, i dont need more stress hell and aggravation added to it. i dont need drugs or alcohol to feel better about myself and ahve a good time. i find other ways to do that shit. when im sad i dont fucking go and crawl in a bottle or smoke myself retarded, im stronger then that and i do what most teens dont and say they do.. I DEAL WITH REALITY! MAYBE YOU SHOULD FUCKIN TRY IT!

the ""high"" only lasts for a little while then you need to go blow fucking money,braincells,life,etc to repeat the process. its fucking dumb! and for those who think that im nothing because i dont follow what most people my age do, i may very well be..but you kno what? i dont fucking care! its my life, let ME live it..if you dont like it.. go the fuck away!



i still find it pretty sad that people feel the need to find artifical happiness and good feeling when theres plenty of things to do that have the same effect.

GROW UP YOU FUCKING FUCKTARD!"

golly i love the snow <3
but, i had work..it sucked, cuz my feet froze so bad i couldnt feel up and i ended up slipping and falling on my ass.so that didnt help my back any. 
Friday: did nothing all day. ummm.. then had work at 4. thats was awesome! i love working at the playroom. its like being 6 years old again. everythings so fun and realitys no where to be found. Its friday, so its not to busy. we had 5 kids. which isnt bad at all. Sam and Nick came in alot today. we had  some ball fights.. they got a few good shots in.. but so did i! :) haha i think the new girl is really starting to like friday nights. they're the best night to work. we have so much fun, cuz i just let loose and its really funny to watch. So amy (the new girl) was laughing alot, which is good. making people smile is what i live for. i even had Piper and Gray smiling! and Grays usually so grumpy and Piper today, all she wanted me to do today was hold her, which is just dandy. so anyway..after work, i went to D'Angelos and got Dinner for Me mom rel and Linda. then came home and ate, talked on the phone a bit to Uncle Bad Example (*yay!!*) and various other people. then MOM and LINDA wanted ice cream so forced me to drive all the way to friggin Friendly's..gerr. haha the people there must have thought we were on crack. Me and my sis went to get ice cream.. we were waiting for someone to help us for like 10mins.. then rel went and stole a menu and then they noticed we were waiting. lol lazy fucks. but then they took down what we wanted and when we were waiting, we coudlnt stop laughing. these two teenage kids who worked in the kitchen kept lookin at us.  so anyway we get the friggin ice cream adn then stupid me lets rel drive my car in the parkin lot.. HOLY SHIT! IM NEVER EVER!!! DOING THAT AGAIN! that was the worse thing ever. shes the worst driver. but i was to busy laughing to notice.. haha.  

then i came home and talked to Beautiful Matt :) and connor..  i miss him so much.
i got to Lowell tomorrow.. i hope<3

"event","hehe wow i have alot to catch up on.

 i'll skip last week and such, cuz it doesnt count. i did the same that as i always do, work and school. big shocker there.

ANYWHO!
the weekend and this week:!
saturday: 
went to visit my uncle dave in Watertown. chilled with him and his buddies for a little while. then left there around 3 or 4 and headed to Lowell to see mah baby. I Picked Pete up and work and went back to his house. ended up staying the night cuz i got snowed in..score! lol. it was fun, we watched movies and such. Cathrine (his mom) played her guitar for me cuz she wanted my oppinion on something. and then she had me ""try"" something.. lol, apparently she didnt kno i can play guitar.lol But then later that night their neighbor came over and Cathrine and him were haning out in the living room and me and pete went to his room to watch the Mask. awesome. then Cathrine asked me out in the livingroom to help her sing something, so that was fun. then around 11pm-ish the Cops came to their house. i guess Mikes (their neighbor) wifey thing called the cops on him. so that was interesting.

Sunday:
ended up stayin in Lowell, again :) snow had stoped by that night but roads were shit and Cathrine wouldnt let me drive home to the cape. so i stayed there and hung out. Peter called in to work. i called into work, cuz i wasnt able to get to the cape. But Gena had told me not to come in anyways because the cape got slamed with snow..im so sad i missed it.i drew a whole bunch of pics for pete and put um in the scrap book i gave him for xmas, he really liked um :)

Monday:
No school, for me OR pete. so guess what?!! i stayed in lowell..agaiN! lol. we hung out, i called Laurie, and she wasnt even Opening the playroom, so i didnt have to work anyways. Cathrine had to work so it was just me and pete. I went to go to dig out my car, after having it sit in snow for 2 days. but, apparently my car had gotten towed sunday night. some parking bann. wich kinda sucks, cuz on his street theres like 40 houses/appartments and 3 driveways. lol so you HAVE to park on the street. but i got towed because the house i parked infront of, the owner drives a plow. its no big  deal.

Tuesday:
I had no school, pete did :( so i got up with him in the morning. then he went off to school, and Cathrine took me to the ATM and to get my Car. i got my car, paid 50$ to get it out, which isnt bad cuz they were gunna mark it for 90, adn then changed it to 70, and then there was something about they had told someone to leave it at 50 cuz i had called about it before tuesday. i dunno, so that was good. then i hoped on the highway and headed home.A few little things happedn on the way home: i had a pile of snow fall on my car from and 18wheeler.so the car behind me kinda tapped the bumber, but no biggie. hehe on the way home, this little kid threw his sneaker out the window..on the highway!! i thought it was hilarious. but anywho.. i got home, 5 feet of snow on the cape! SO FRIGGIN AWESOME! yeah, im a snowbird :) love it! it was aweeeeeeeesome! it goes up to my shoulders though. haha.

so when i got home, rel and mom were fighting about the dumbest stuff. i was about to leave and i had just gotten home. later tuesday night, i went and picked up Brat, and we went to Erins to hang out. Me,brat, erin, chex,d'dave, adn jules all hung out and watched RoadTrip. it was a very eventful evening.

and then today: NO SCHOOL! but i had to work in the snow! i hate guys who think just cuz im female i dont know anything. these two like 17 year old punks got stuck in the snow and couldnt get out. so i went to help um and they basically told me i didnt kno what i was talking about. but then Tommy, who lives behind the station came out to help and told them the SAME thing i told um, and they listened, and what do u kno? NO MORE BEING STUCK! gerr. assholes.

No school for the rest of the week :) so i guess midterms are next week.. cuz they were saposta be this week.. but we've had all snow days!! but i gotta work tomorrow..eww

thats it for now
Much Love

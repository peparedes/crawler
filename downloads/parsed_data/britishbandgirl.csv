i'm sorry but i dont' care if it's an a good friend or a just a random person at my party...if they're drunk they're staying put...who says ""go wait in your car or drive home?""  an asshole...that's who....
i'm so angry and hurt right now......what a way to top of what i thought was a fun evening...fuck him...it's completely evident he wants me out of his life now..i just never thought he would be the kind of person to let me drive drunk just to get me out of his life....so that's exactly what he's going to get....

i miss my guy friends...i hate hanging out with girls all of the time...all they do is depress me..bad mouth people and i end up feeling worse than i did to begin with...don't get me wrong i love my friends..but i can only take so much of the girl's night out stuff....i miss mark so bad right now....
there is something wrong when you're supposedly ""friends"" with someone but you're not allowed to hang out with them unless you're invited....that's not friendship at all...where do i meet these people?  my feelings were so hurt tonight...so hurt.

i'm really scared about moving away and losing touch with all of my friends here....one of them, mainly chuck, is most frightening but at the same time i feel its inevitable.....he says that we won't...but as far as he's concerned, especially by the way he's been acting, i'm already gone...i just know that it takes two people to maintain long distance relationships...friendship or otherwise...and it's going to be all on me....and i've already given up....
i've learned very brutally the last two months that you should never put someone in a place of importance or priority when they only see you as an option.
it just makes me really sad....it's going to be a long three months until i move to tulsa.  
by the way, i'll be living with my friend carol and her two brothers in their really big house....i'm looking forward to it...it'll make missing chuck an d everyone a little more bearable....its scary going back to a place where i hardly know anyone anymore...

i saw wilco on monday. they were awesome!! exactly what i needed to make my week a little better.
well, must study for my final in anatomy..yes, it's only a week and a half away...yikes!

"event","so it is official.  i didn't get in to the o.u. nursing school here in okc.  i'm #23 on the waiting list though.  that is the part that really makes me mad. they took 40 people less this year than last year; if it had been the same then i would have been in.  but i suppose its just not meant to be right now...much like other things in my life
so i will be moving to tulsa to live with a few friends on or close to July 31st.  the day before my birthday...yay, two things to look forward to...growing old and moving backwards in a way.
so dustin and i have been exchanging emails a lot lately....i don't really have any feelings toward it...just indifference, which is really good.  but we still have a lot in common so i think eventually we would make really good friends.  
anyways, that's all i really have to say for now...i'm starting to get excited about moving...lots to do...i just hope i don't fail my classes...i don't feel very encouraged right now. ah well, whatca going do about it?

"event","so this is probably the scariest thing i've had to go through well..with the exception of when carol's dad was sick....but now i am officially alone...i was doing things that i should not have been doing..sleeping with an ex about two or three times a week...it was wrong and i know it...but i miss him and it's comfortable...anyways, there are always repurcussions to my actions..always.
i had a pregnancy scare...turns out everything is okay...my pills were basically too strong for me and caused me to miss...so now i have new pills...and have yet to figure out why on at home test came back positive and then the second one came back negative....also i got tired of chuck pushing and pushing and asking what the hell was wrong with me...why i thought i had any right to project all of my stress at him? he had no idea...so i told him what was worrying me....it of course freaked him out...i went to the doc and found out i'm not...and chuck has decided that the best thing to do would be to just completely ignore and avoid me....because evidently this is all my fault.
i'm not really sure how to take this...i'm so hurt...and i feel like i just ruined are growing relationship for what turned out to be nothing...now, not only have i lost that glimmer of hope that one day in the far away future we might end up together...but i also lost a friend....
what makes it even better...i'm pretty sure this whole avoiding me thing also has to do with the fact that he has a new girl interested in him and he has someone new to ponder about....figures. it must be really easy for him to move on now that i scared the crap out of him... i guess the one good thing about this is that it will make moving away from him a little bit easier.  i wish i had a really good guy friend to talk to here.  i miss that..i miss jason and mark. i just want to go home.

okay so i hope everyone is doing well...i've been okay...i have yet to check my grades in class...i should even though i'm kind of scared...so if there's a really sad post after this one it's because i'm not doing that great.
so in about 2 to 4 months i'll be moving to tulsa. i'm in search of job right now...i desperately need one...i don't know what i'm going to do once i move back..it's kind of scary...i really don't want to leave my friends here...i really really really don't(especially one person in particular) but i can't really justify staying either...argh. this sucks...but i just gotta look at it from a positive angle...i'll get a job..save some money...get to travel more...yeah...i'll just keep telling myself that."

"event","i need to get out of this place more than anyone knows right now....i've found out things that i don't want to know...stuff that i think i always knew but didn't really want to realize in my head so i just blocked them out.  i just want to start a new life with someone new who's going to treat me the way i need to be treated...i'm sick to my stomach.....i can't wait to move away from the place and all of the pain that i have tied to it....i think that's the only way i'm going to be free of all of these games and lies and emotional rollercoasters...
what's sad is i know exactly who i would love to be with but it's just not possible...we both have the exact same problems right now and it just wouldnt work.....and the one person who is showing interest i don't really want to start anything with at this point...in case you guys don't remember me mentioning mike a long time ago...well, apparently he let one of my closest friends know that he regretted the way things went with us and that given the chance he would do it again bu right this time...and i know it's not lie...because he'd have no reason to tell this person a lie..as far as he knew i wasn't really even talking to him anymore....and i don't really know what to do with this now....i'm just not ready to take the protective shield off of my heart yet...i'm just scared out of my mind....there is only one person that i would ever completely trust my heart with and it just can't work....it sucks so bad...maybe a few years ago if i had acted on it before both of our relationships began but it's just not going to happen...
i need to be someone else for the rest of the semester.
i hope everyone is well....i miss everyone so much
love to all.

but my classes are going well...for once..without really trying...i've been working out a lot lately..so that's good....buy yet i'm still not really happy...
i guess that's the problem with being in a relationship for two years...you forget what it's like to not have anyone....that's what i miss the most....but i refuse to look for anyone either...i just am having a blah year i suppose....i hope it gets better

he told me the other day that he is moving to boston.  i'm so sad.  why can't i get him out of my heart?  i know that i have to move on now...but i'm stuck with this drowning feeling...i need to get away from this place. i believe that i will be moving back to tulsa soon....but that's a big change...but maybe that's what i need...i have at least this semester to finish up here..and then maybe i can move back....i don't know how to be without him...it's so hard to live like this and then watch him live his life like none of it really mattered at all.....but i guess that's the way it will always be for me....

things on the relationship side are not that great.  i don't know how to just end it and let it go....i don't know if i can let go of the friendship. but then again i also know that i can't be around him if we're just going to be friends. and i can't date him seriously because i'll get distracted...i don't know what to do.  why do i fall in love with guys like this?  why can't i have it as easy as some?

i'm watching mystery science theater with brittany and greg.  it totally reminds me of the summer after high school...i miss you everyone..gary, travis, nancy, nick, peter, even dustin sometimes, but especially travis and nancy!!!  how i miss the days when we would go swimming in our underwear and crash cars into travis's parents' ditch.  those were the days! :)"

"event","so i'm going to try and tell you guys about my trip about.....without sounding too cheesy or annoying...this would be a lot easier if i had my journal so that i could remember the really good details...

the first day was definitely the longest but one of the best...we had no idea where to go to get an underground pass...so we walked around london for about six hours..completely lost..had no idea how to get back to our flat....but it was so awesome..i loved it..i loved seeing the people and the buildings...i'm never felt so at home so quickly in a new environment....  
the second day we picked up his brother and went shopping for a little while....we had our first encounter with Oxford Circus...my god, it truly is one...i have never seen so many stores and so many people shopping...it was like the day after Thanksgiving every day.  we ended up eating at hard rock that night since it was chuck's bday....it was fun.
the rest of the days are kind of a blur..i don't remember what we did on each one so i'll just list all the place we went ....
went to portabello market three times..it was awesome...bought some raspberries and strawberries and ate them as i shopped..yummy..bought a really cool jacket one day because it started raining on us.
chuck bought a really cool looking gas mask..he's gonna paint it and hang it on his wall...they had so many things that i wanted to buy...i wish i had more money with me

we went to a lot of art galleries...the national gallery first, the salvador dali/picasso gallery(that one was truly awesome), tate modern, and the best and most interesting of them all...at least to me..the saatchi gallery...it was a lot of really weird indie art stuff...they had a guy who sculpted his head out of his own frozen blood...it was cool...
the only museum we went to was the science museum....it was cool..a lot of old medical stuff...
we saw west minister abbey, london bridge, london tower, the london eye, the zoo, the aquarium(i don't even know how to spell that), the london dungeon, madame tassuad's, namco station......
we went to this really awesome theater to see the harry potter movie..the same place that they had the premier..it was so awesome..i'm gonna have to figure out a way to get my pics on line so that you guys can see them
we also got to go on this really interesting jack the ripper tour...they took us around and showed us the original buildings and the places where they found the body...it was cool...that was probably won of my favorites...
the clubs were cool and the pubs were nice...i found out i do not like english food..too bland..no flavor...that's probably one of the only things i missed about the US.
i loved their public transportion..i'm really jealous of that...i would give anything not to have to drive to class or work all the time..i hate cars....but i need one so i will be nice to mine.

well, i know that doesn't really give alot of info..but i really need my pics to explain some of the stuff..i will get them up as soon as i can..don't worry not all of them..lord, that would be like 300 pictures...just the good ones...

love to all! 

-m

p.s. at the end of it all, i realized that i can't be in oklahoma the rest of my life..i still need to find myself..."

alison if you want me to get you that snow globe mail me some dinero and i will get it for you. call me and i can give you my address or you can mail it to da busta. by the way, we all miss you very much. and i'm beginning to hate a certain new manager(not ash) and her i'm better than everyone because i'm a full time manager and not a part time manager.  whatever, i know more shit about this store than she does. ah well. i won't be there after london anyways.  well, god willing i find a new job before i leave. no luck so far but i still have 13 days. 
i miss my lab chicas.  we're supposed to get a manicure and pedicure done this friday as a reward for getting through the semester together. i'm really looking forward to it.  it was nice to have female friends again.  was..it is nice to have female friends again.  
i think i'm gonna have just enough money for london.  even if i only have enough for the apt., london pass(transportation), and admission fees to places that will be good. i'm just gonna be happy going.
things with chuck have gotten a lot better recently, i'm sure partly because he's no longer in school, but also because we had a good talk sunday night.  i'm going to be optimistic about it...i don't know how else to be really....but i'm hoping and praying for the best.  
i must go fold my laundry now. hope all is well.  will try to write again before i leave and while i'm there.

"event","i have by brain slice quiz in exactly one hour...i think i'll do pretty good as long as i remember how every little thing is spelled...evidently the woman that sets up the practicals and tests(i met here yesterday) but she likes to grade really hard on this one...so correct spelling is a must. 
i leave for london in less than a month now...i bought a book on some of the sites and restaurants along with a lot of maps...i'm getting excited now...i think this is going to be really fun...if anyone wants anything in particular let me know and give me some money before i leave...because the way it's looking now..i will probably have enough to eat and go places...so alison if you want you're big ben waterglobe contact me before you leave :) 
i woke up with my glands swollen today...i hope i'm not getting sick...i have to give a presentation on The Cure tommorrow in my modern mozarts class...i'm not really sure what video to show..these people have never seen them and i want to show them the most impressive one...any ideas? 
well, i need to study some spelling for my quiz so i will end this now...
does anyone know what the weather is like in london and paris during the end of may and june? probably not warm, huh?

p.s. the song ""float on"" by modest mouse is stuck in my head.  it makes me feel really happy...i love that song."

i need to feel loved again....i miss that....
hope everyone is doing well. i have one month until i go to london...i still don't have nearly enough money...i don't want to ask for help....but i may have to....i'm just so dissappointed in myself lately....i don't know what's wrong with me...evidently i'm not good enough for some people, maybe i need to change....

i get to go home today for a very much needed break from norman. there are some days that i really just hate this place. granted, there are some wonderful people here but everyone else just sucks. there are way too many dumbass fraternity and sorority people in this town...it reeks of ignorance and STD's. i have now made it abundantly clear to myself that i cannot live in oklahoma for the rest of my life. i can't wait to go to nursing school..if i get in. 

on a somber note, i may have to take my bloody anatomy class over.  i totally made the stupidest, most dumbass mistake on my last quiz and basically bombed it.  so if i end up with a ""D"" in the class because of it i will have to take it over.  yarf. another semester of hell.  

i need to check my grade but seriously, i'm afraid to.  in fact, i don't think i will.  i just keep going and try to make ""A""'s (hahahaha) on everything else for the next..let's see...oh yeah, 3 WEEKS!!!!....sure..that'll fix my grade...(sigh)what a sad person i am. :)"

"event","that's all i feel like i've been doing lately.  

i moved into my new apartment.  it's a  little bit bigger than my other one.  and it's got two walk in closets. woohoo!!!  i should be on cribs...just kidding...
now comes the crappy part. unpacking.  while i have the majority of it done. all of the things in my bedroom are still predominantly packed up. i probably should have unpacked those first but i kind of worked my way to the kitchen to the the back of the apartment.   but it's beginning to feel like home now.  

i'm going to the see the strokes on wed. that is, if they let us have our tickets.  someone thought it would be funny to put their last name on mine even though my license clearly does not say so.   so now i got figure out if they will let me change it over the phone or if just having the confirmation number going to be enough.

relationship-wise, not okay.  don't really have time or the energy to talk about it right now.  basically it's the same old shit. he's confused which makes me confused which makes me unhappy because he won't tell me why.  
why do i have to have the 'never give up/love will prevail/have a little faith in me' personality?  it gets me in so deep that i don't know if i can ever get out.
or maybe this is just the way life is.  there are some people like me who give, give, give trying to make everyone happy. they get absolutely nothing out of it. and then there are those that just take, take, take.  
maybe that's just the way it is.  maybe i just need to give up on people.

off to lab.

there's this girl...and i just need to get this off my chest. there's this asian girl who seemed nice on first impression. but oh no! what a bitch.  and i can't really pinpoint exactly what it is, but she's rude, mean, and constantly speaks down to people.  and even worse she's smart and is taking anatomy for fun.  who the hell takes this class for fun? who enjoys cutting up dead bodies for fun? i mean yeah at points it's really cool but fun. i'm sorry, but spending about three to four hours a day with a dead body does not sound like fun to me. 
 oh and i know what you're think.  i'm jealous because she makes hundreds on all her test. seriously, hundreds plus bonus. no i don't like her because she's smart and she refuses to help anyone but instead make them feel like idiots.  i think that's just bitchy. i hate people like her.  i'm just glad she's not in my lab group.

so now that the rant is over. sorry all i'm just frustrated.

"event","so i'm stuck...i'm completely stressing out.  i don't know what to do about anything in my life anymore....so out of curiosity i joined eharmony just to see if they could find me a match... after all, they say that eighty percent of their matches end up in marriage...
so here's the funny part...they say that it takes about two or three months to find a match since they do it all based on personality tests...and even then they can't promise on...they found me a match in three days. he goes to o.u. and is one year older than me....so now i gotta ask myself..should i communicate with him...or is this just me with pent up anger towards chuck? i think it is..i think that i'm so afraid that he's cheating on me that i feel like i have to also...why am i like this?  
i have no concrete evidence whatsoever...just my own untrusting suspiciois stupid self that's keeps looking for things....
but i think i'm getting tired of the way i'm being treated...when did i go from being someone he wanted to be with all the time...someone he was sweet to all the time..to someone that he's mean to and basically  ignores unless i show that i'm upset....
and the truth of it all is i still love him and i want to trust him...but i'm not really sure he loves me anymore....

"event","so here is my problem/question of the week? and i really would like honest answers so if you feel like it please respond....
i've come to the conclusion that no matter how much i want to trust him, i don't.  i feel like he keeps things from me and that really bothers me.  and it's not like i want to know where he is or who he's with all the time, but when you decide to start talking to your ex-girlfriend again and you keep it a secret it makes me really suspicious.  it makes me wonder what else he is hiding.  i asked him the other day if he was going to see her. he said probably not. and then i said if you did, would you tell me? he said no, he probably wouldn't it because of the way i would react.  and that even if i didn't want him to see her he would anyways and that i was just going to have to deal with it.  and the thing that gets to me is that he initiated it. he emailed her.  he called her(earlier this summer). and he said he doesn't know why and that he would never get back together with her. so why does he have to talk to her?
this is when i got upset.  not so much because he wanted to see her but because of the complete lack of consideration for my feelings and the fact that he wouldn't at least let me know. that fact that he would lie about it.  
and so now i have all of these angry feelings that are just building...and i don't think i trust him anymore.  or at least now i'm having a lot of trouble trusting him.  am i taking this the wrong way? am i overreacting?
how can i love someone so much and not trust them?  i don't know if i should be in this anymore.

so here's the question, based on the things you have read...what should i do? should i stay or should i go?

how do i end up with guys like this?

so today i have to take a quiz that i didn't study for....oh well. 
is it sad that i'm beginning to not care?

i just want to go away. i can't wait to go to london.  

i had an m.r.i. yesterday for my migraines and i'm supposed to get the results today.  hope everything is okay.  i could have gotten them yesterday but i didn't have time to wait so she told me she would call me today.  now i wish i would have waited and been late to work.  

well, i'm going to the U to at least partly study for my quiz...hope all are well. 
love,
-m"

"event","i guess hotmail is having problems cause i can't check my email.  i hate that. it's so bloody annoying.  
i'm so exhausted. i belive i am officially tired of life.
so this is going to be a drama free week. i hate saying that cause now it will probably happen but i'm seriously going to try to make it a drama free week.  
mark is leaving or has left today. a bunch of us had dinner with him last night.  i seriously wanted to cry when i hugged him goodbye but i didn't want to make a scene. i will miss him terribly though.  it was one of those friendships that we didn't have to talk all the time to remain close.  i'm sure i'll see him again. i'm just sad that i won't be able to so easily now.  

on a different note, i'm going to the doctor tommorrow for my headaches again. wish me luck that nothing is wrong with me.  

i got strokes tickets saturday.  i should be more excited buy i'm just to tired and too preoccupied for it.  
lord, send me an angel to help me get through this week.

       6 oz (1 cn) frozen apple juice           5    To 7 apples
            -unsweetened concentrate            1 tb Butter or margarine
       2 tb Rounded all purpose flour;               Nutmeg (optional)
       1 ts Cinnamon                            1    9"" double-crust pie shell
     1/4 ts Salt                                     -unbaked
  
   In a small saucepan, combine the frozen apple juice, flour, cinnamon
   and salt. Stir constantly over medium heat until the mixture is thick
   and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Peel and slice the apples and stir them
   into the apple juice mixture. Pour the mixture into the unbaked pie
   shell and dot with butter. Position the top crust over the filling,
   cutting slits for the steam to escape. Trim and seal the edges. Brush
   the top very lightly with water and sprinkle with nutmeg if desired.
   Bake at 450 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and
   bake for 30 minutes more.
   
   Serves 6-8


Yes, i made this yesterday for a bday at work.  I also made my marble cheesecake.  Both were a huge hit, so i thought i would add the apple pie recipe in here.  Its low calorie, low fat, and sugar free."

Unfortunately, his blog is now defunct - someone at his work found his blog online, and his job being what it is, he had to take the blog down.  Now Jack doesn't know me at all, but somehow, just being on his list gives me a sense of responsibility, and makes me feel kinda special.  I look up to this man, so to be on his list is kind of n honor to me.  

No one knows this, but i have secret fantasies of being a cop, or an FBI agent.  Through Jack's blog, i was able to live out the fantasy.  I know that i will never be either of those things.  My vision is terrible, I wouldn't pass the physical with my mechanical ankle, and I hate guns. So i obsess through CSI, Law and Order, Crossing Jordan, Without a Trace...any cop show i can find.  Jack also fed my obsession, through his real life tales of his day to day life, both the drama and the comedy of it.

The fact that he is/was an amazing writer didn't hurt either.  

Jack, if you're reading this, please let me know if/when you decide to begin your chronicles again.  It's nice to know about the real life heroes out there."

"event","The trainer chick gave me my protein goals, BMI, all that stuff. Nothing was really a surprise - in fact the BMI was within 2% of my guesstimate. However, the one shockign thing was that i should be eating a whopping 143g of protein per day! My goal has been 50g per day (which was upping it!) and sometimes i don't even hit that! I average between 50 and 60g per day, so this is definitely somehting i will have to work on. UGH. However, she confirmed my calorie intake was right on, so thats good!

She had a goal of 56 lbs for me. I'm shooting for 80 though ahhaha

So the last few days - since Wednesday when i met hte trainer chick, i've been consciously trying to meet the protein goals, and I have been, without a terrible amount of effort.  Chicken breast is my best friend ahhaha  Also, you can get 9-10g of protein from 1 cup of skim milk, and i usually have two cups when i drink milk.  Today i did really well in that i cut my fat by 10 grams from my avg, and halved my carbs.  

Wednsday i did 20 minutes on the bike after meeting the trainer to go over my nutritional goals (and getting her spiel about nutrisystem or whatever).  I was running late so i left after the bike.  I was supposed to help Jen with her resume, and midway through shopping for some decent food, she called and cancelled until the next day.  dammit.  that nanoys me.  don't call me 20 minutes before you're sposed ot show up, specially when you know i'm rescheduling my day for it.  grr.  i went and returned some stuff to wallyworld, and then hit target for my tax software.  got that started, and Brenda - you and Jess were right.  I love It's Deductible!  I'm jsut waiting on my interest statements so i can finish my taxes.  I also need to compile my medical deductions.

So thursday night, instead of working out, i had to come home for Jen.  She comes over, I fix food, and tried to start her resume, and again, she decides against it.  I didnt say anything.  She has issue.  But it still annoys me.  

Friday night, i did pretty well with the workout.  I did 41 minutes on the treadmill, and about 25 minutes on circuit training.  Go me :)

SO far, I'm down 4 lbs.  Woo!

Today though, my back was sore, and so i took the day off the workout.  I have to be careful to not hurt it again.  I was running late last night, and didnt make it to the chiro, instead opting to cancel rather than making the staff sit there and wait.  I go back monday.  

Tomorrow I meet with the trainer, for the last free session, to go over my workout, etc.  I'm gonna go watch a movie or something. Later y'all"

The woman was a single mom of 3, and worked at starbucks.  Tough right?  Then this woman took in her brothers 6 kids because he and his wife were heroin addicts, and the kids were about to be split up in foster care.  So this woman, who worked at starbucks and lived in a 3 bedroom, 1 bath apartment, now has 9 kids. This is a GOOD woman. 

Oprah took her and the kids to Toys r us for a shopping spree.  Then she gave them new furniture since the woman's furniture was falling apart - dressers without drawers, etc.  Then, Oprah says - well but there's a problem.  All this stuff won't fit into your tiny apartment.  SO Oprah is buying her a house. Her very own house that she picks out.  Whatever she wants, to help her out of the crack infested neighborhood where people are killed on a daily basis.

1 box butter/golden cake mix
1 small box instant vanilla pudding
1 small box instant chocolate pudding
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups water
Mix all together with a  mixer at medium speed for about 4minutes (lumps should go away)
Then mix in:
3-4 ounces of chocolate chips
3-4 ounces of white chips
 
Bake at 350 degrees for about 30-40 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean from the center - this was the time for 2 (8inch) cake pans.  For 13x9 it took 40-45 minutes.  Ice with choc icing of your choice, or no icing at all."

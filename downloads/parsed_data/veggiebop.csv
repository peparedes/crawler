"event","I haven't been writing in my journal these last few days...  Not too many exciting things have happened.  

Wednesday for most of the day I was in Des Moines.  We took my cousin to the airport.  Then went to a couple stores shopping.  But we didn't go to a mall. (that's where I wanted to go)   I got wall paper border to go along the top of the wall in my room.  Then at a music store I got an electric turner so I can tune my guitar.  Finally, I can play in tune, lol.  

Thursday...I can't remember what I did.  Nothing to talk about.

Yesterday (Friday) I participated in Relay For Life.  I don't know much about the event, but it raises money for cancer research.  It was an all night event.  It lasted from 7pm Friday until 7am today (Saturday).  One person on each team always has to be walking.  I walked from around 7:45-10:30.  I got a little bit of sleep in the tent we put up....but only for a few hours.  I walked some in the morning too.  

Most of today I have been sleeping.  Tomorrow I leave for summer camp.  I will be gone a week.  I get to go rock climbing at camp.  It's going to be fun!  I just hope it's not so hot.  I'll write about it when I get back.  Bye!"

"event","I had to go talk to a group of old people today about China.  I just got back from a 11 day educational tour of China two weeks ago.  It was cool to be able to talk about the trip, kinda relive it.  They wanted to know what is was like in China.

I was online again a lot this afternoon.  <a href=""http://www.kiwibox.com"" target=""_blank"">kiwibox</a> again.  I haven't updated my website since I opened Saturday.  I already have an idea for a new layout and have started working on it....even though I haven't finished the one that I have up now.  Oh well.

I'm so happy, my mom has finally given me $16 to buy the <a href=""http://www.michellebranch.net"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Branch</a> cd!  I'm ordering her independent cd Broken Braclet.  I just watched Michelle's new video for ""Everywhere"".  It's a really neat video!  I hope it's on mtv sometime soon.

Tomorrow my mom and I have to take my cousin to an airport that is an hour and half away from where I live.  I don't want to go, but I have to.  And were leaving at 8am.  <b>I want my sleep!</b>  Goodnight!"

"event","I just finished writing this a few minutes ago.  I went to sleep at 2am but I woke up and 6am and just wanted to write something.  I was thinking about so much last night...I'll write about that later.  Here is the poem I just wrote.  It's called <i>I Am A Butterfly</i><p>
<i>I am a butterfly
Who does't want to fly away
Way up high

I use to have to hide from those
Who wanted to bring me down
This isn't what I chose

So much time spend alone and ugly
Just to become a short lived beauty
I hope the days go by slowly

I am a butterfly
But I wish I could be you
Now I must say good-bye</i><p>
This poem is probably going to sound so stupid to me when I read this once I am fully awake.  I have never actually written a poem before...."

"event","I have been on <a href=""http://www.kiwibox.com"" target=""_blank"">kiwibox.com</a> most of today.  I am so addicted to that site!  I have just been signing people's qbooks.  If you go to kiwibox, my username there is ITZlesley.

Did anyone watch trl today?  I'm not even a Backstreet Boys fan, but I was sad to hear the news.  If don't already know, AJ from bsb is having problems with depression and alcoholism and had to go get help.  bsb had to move back all the tour dates for this month.  The four of them just looked so sad...they all were almost crying.  I don't care about bsb, but I hope AJ gets better.  Best wishes to him.  I'm glad that he is getting help.  On a happy note, Sum 41 was #2!!  I hope they go all the way to #1!

I went to <a href=""http://www.thespark.com"" target=""_blank"">thespark.com</a> for the first time today.  I had heard about it before...but never actually visited it.  Those tests are neat.  Here are some of my results:
I am 95% pure
8% stressed
And according to the personality test, I am an accountant (submissive introvert concrete thinker)  Here's what that means:<font size=""1"">
Like just 7% of the population you are an ACCOUNTANT (SICT)--reserved, meticulous, and dependable. While being called an accountant isn't really that cool, neither are you. You aren't exactly the life of the party, but you do have fun, and the people close to you really do love you. 
Accountants are good at whatever they do. They can always be trusted, especially by their friends. They almost never cheat or steal. (Some real-life accountants do, however, they are probably Judges (DICT)). You probably have a wonderful relationship with your family.
</font>
That so sounds like me!  Wow, for once a test where the results are true, lol.  I am going to go take some more tests.  

Has anyone actually read my journal?  Just wondering..."

"event","yumm.....mint chip ice cream....I'm eating a mint chip milkshake. =)

Today I had to go to a family gathering thing.  My cousins live in Texas are back in town.  We went to a park and had a cookout and that kinda thing.  There were around 15 people there...almost all adults.  The only kids were little.  So basically, I sat outside for a few hours while everyone talked.  BORING!

When I got home I put on my new Sugar Ray cd and went to sleep for a few hours.  I was so tired, but I'm not anymore.  I don't think I have anything planned all week...maybe I'll just sleep.  And go online."

"event","I watched Save The Last Dance this morning.  I was to tired last night to watch it.  It was a really good movie!  If you haven't seen it yet, you should.

Besides that, I've been working on my website all day.  It's still not done...but I've opened it.  <a href=""http://www.liquid2k.com/lesley"" target=""_blank"">visit my site</a>  I'm getting annoyed.  It's taking so long and I still can't fixed a few problems.  grrr...."

"event","So, I finally got myself a journal.  I always thought about making one, but never did.  I have never kept a journal before so this is something new for me.  I guess I have to start somewhere.    
<p>
I have been so tired today.  I was online last night until 2:00am working on my new website.  I have worked on it ALL day today also, but it still isn't finished.  I hope *crosses fingers* I will be ready to open my site within the next few days.<p>
Tonight I went shopping with my mom.  My room was just painted a couple weeks ago (pink walls and light blue celling) and I needed new bedding and that kind of thing.  We went to K-Mart first, but couldn't find anything.  Then we went to Wal-Mart.  I found this pretty sky blue blanket that had flowers on it.  We bought it and the sheets to go with it.  I'm so happy I found it, I didn't think I was going to be able to find anything!  Then I had to wait for 30 minutes while my mom talked to someone she knew.  Boring!  Why is it that we always run into people we know at Wal-Mart?  My mom let me get 2 cds.  I got Sugar Ray and Sum 41.  I love shopping for cds!  <p>
I guess that's it for my first journal entry.  If you read the whole thing, you're probably so bored right now.  Maybe future entries will be more exciting and contain something besides a boring shopping trip.  Buh-bye, I'm going to go watch Save The Last Dance."

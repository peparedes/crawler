"event","Alright, I've put a moderate amount of thought into these, and along with some unedcuated guesses,  I think I have some pretty strong predicts here.  Oh, and having only seen three of the five movies nominated for best picture, they might be a bit of a shot in the dark.  Fuck it.

<b>Best Supporting Actress</b> Jennifer Hudson, Dreamgirls - <b>CORRECT! now it just remains to be seen if she can actually act or just sings on screen with some conviction.  Time will tell!</b>
Who would I have picked? Adriana Barazza, Babel

<b>Best Supporting Actor</b> Eddie Murphy, Dreamgirls - <b>WRONG! Good, too, I say since he stormed off like a little bitch after not winning</b>Who would I have picked? Having seen all of the films except Little Children, I have to say they seem to be some weak choices.. I'd give it to Murphy (even though he wasn't <i>that</i> good) if it means never hearing a trailer proclaim ""Starring Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, and.......Eddie Murphy.."" again.

<b>Best Actress</b> Helen Mirren, The Queen <b>CORRECT!</b>
Who would I have picked?  Well, I just realized I haven't seen a single one of these movies.  Lets go with Kate Winslet. She's pretty good.

<b>Best Actor</b> Forest Whitaker, The Last King of Scotland <b>CORRECT!</b>
Who would I have picked? ONLY because I haven't yet seen Last King of Scotland (plan on seeing it later today), I'll go with Ryan Gosling.  He was absolutely incredible in Half Nelson.  

<b>Best Director</b> Martin Scorcese, The Departed <b>CORRECT!</b>
Who would I have picked? Out of the nominees, I'd choose Scorcese.  That being said, I think Guillemero Del Toro should have been nominated and ultimately won the award.  Pan's Labyrinth was so original, poignant and beautiful.  The Departed is still my favourite movie of 2006, but I think if Scorcese is finally recognized, it won't be solely on the strength of his latest crime masterpiece, but to make up for snubbing him with Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas.  So while I think Scorcese has been robbed, and I won't be disappointed in the least if he wins, he wasn't the absolute best.  It is a shame that Del Toro and also Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men) weren't nominated.

<b>Best Picture</b>Babel <b>WRONG! Pleasant surprise though, considering..</b>
Who would I have picked? The Departed."

"event","As if there weren't enough amazing albums in 2006, I've recently got my hands on a couple that unfortunately I didn't hear in time, but I'll be damned if it was from lack of trying.  OK, it was 100% lack of effort on my part.  So sue me.  The records (or ""rekkids"", if you're a douchebag)in question are Off With Their Heads' brilliant 8-song EP<i>Hospitals</i> and Crime in Stereo's sophomore full-length <i>The Troubled Stateside</i>.  

I just can't stop listening to these fuckin' things!  OWTH take lyrics so depressing that after a few listens, your vain, disparate ""life"", which consists of waking up and watching a Rosanne DVD marathon while drinking whatever was on sale at the liquor store out of a pint glass and then masturbating using your own tears as lubricant until you pass out in a puddle of your own various bodily fluids, seems pretty good in comparison.  And it's catchy as hell!

<i>The Troubled Stateside</i>, while not as suicide-inducing as OWTH's latest, is still pretty fucking good.  Its fast, hard, and melodic, which, if you know me at all, are the three keys to my musical heart.  I've heard them being compared to labelmates No Trigger and A Wilhelm Scream, but they definitely have a more original sound.  If you need some proof, just go listen to Sudan.  It might just be my favourite song.  Of the week.  That or Die Today by Off With Their Heads.



Totally unrelated, me and The Boyz (copyright and trademark) went to Ryerson's ""Night of 9500 Laughs"" on Saturday night.  While the name was deceiving (I only laughed about 6 times through the first 8 performers) local hero Jeff McEnery made it worthwhile with a hilarious set.  

I really need to work on some jokes and try out an act at some open mic or something.  I mean, I don't want to toot my own horn (or do I?[the answer is yes]) I really don't think I could do any worst than all but maybe one or two of the so-called comedians that performed Saturday.  Particularly the guy with the toque. ""Remember the first time you ate a pussy?  Yeaaahh.  I'm drunk.  But yeah remember that clitoris?  I'm just going to call it the clit, cause clitoris sounds weird.  Remember that shit?""  What was up with that guy? Seriously! 

Oh, and unrelated to that, but somewhat related to the beginning of this post: really excited for I Farm. Should be tight. And Smokin' Aces too.  WOOOOOO"

In other news, our little reporter in the field has proven that contrary to previous reports, pimpin' IS easy!

Introducing/unleashing Owen Joseph Beattie-Clarke to y'all. He was born Thrusday, August 17th at Guelph General Hospital at about 8:23 AM. Weighing in at 4lbs, 6oz and measuring about 18 inches long, he's now up to 5lbs 4oz and 21 inches. He's my son and the pride of Mandy and myself. There's nothing like the feeling you get everytime he does something he's never done before.  Its going to be an adventure and I couldn't look forward to it more. 

In other news, my softball team, The Bombers, are rollin' on like a freight train.  We won our first playoff game this past Wednesday (16-6) after finishing the season in second place with a record of 13 wins, 4 losses, and 1 tie.  The first place team, Josh's Pub, went undefeated during the regular season, but both times we played them were very close games and we think we can take them if and when we make it to the finals. You can count on the Bomb Squad.

This is pretty old news, but here's proof that I am, in fact, a good guy.

There's some stiff competition for the ol' Top 10 of the year for music, with a plethora of bands releasing albums ranging from great to amazing.  Alphabetically, just so you don't think I'm listing them in the order of bestness, these bands all deserve a big pat on the back for ""bringing the thunder"" so far this year: Another Breath, Armalite, Bigwig (yeah, it grew on me), Bomb the Music Industry, The Bouncing Souls, The Falcon, I Farm, The Lawrence Arms, The Loved Ones, New Mexican Disaster Squad, No Trigger, Nofx, None More Black, Retrace (breaking in with a great demo), Rise Against (with a nice return to form after the disappointing Siren Songs), The Sainte Catherines, Set Your Goals, Sinking Ships, and Strike Anywhere.  Plus there are still releases from the likes of Fifth Hour Hero and Shook Ones, amongst others. Oh, and Propagandhi actually playing shows! I can not motherfucking wait!

Speaking of things to look forward to, I really want to see the following movies: The Illusionist, Babel, Children of Men, The Departed, The Protector, Rennaisance, The Fountain, and The Prestige."

"event","Nothing could have prepared us for the events that transpired that fateful Friday night in Toronto.  It was a cool May night and the forecast was calling for rain.  We were making our way down the Queen's Quay, the twangy guitars and raspy vocals coming from the speakers on the dash interspersed by patchwork conversation and miscellaneous quips from the three of us in that old Contour, oblivious to the concatenation of events that would soon turn our worlds upside-down, and leave us reeling in the aftermath.  

No, none of us have been the same since that night.  I sometimes reminisce, which usually results in me trying to determine whether it was me who had changed, or indeed the world that had changed around me.  

We couldn't find a parking spot in the deep bowels of the underground parking lot for a fortress-sized grocery store.  It was a good thing that traffic had been light on the way there.  We slowly rolled past bumper after bumper, each one surrounded by concrete pillars, peering left and right, scanning the subterranean profile.  Then the kicker came.  A sign crudely bolted to one of the massive pillars proved our hopes were futile.  A three hour parking limit shattered any remaining optimism for finding a free parking spot.  It was clear we were going to have to find a spot closer to the concert and pay for parking.  If this had been the most shocking thing of the night, we would have all counted ourselves lucky.

Can anyone stop this slo-pitch juggernaut?  Time will tell, but if I had to wager a guess, I'd say this powerhouse team will steamroll over their ""competition"" all season.

"event","Well, this is going to be one crazy, busy week.

Tuesday we try to keep our undefeated record in tact in the highly competitive Slow-pitch softball league.  That's right, I joined a team.  We're called the Coldtech Bombers and so far we've played two games.  We won our first game (24-4) and tied the second (11's all around).  It feels good to be playing baseball again, even if it is a stripped-down, bastardized version of baseball meant for middle-aged drunks.  It is fun though, and that's the main thing.

I've got two shows to look forward to this week, one on Wednesday and the other on Friday.  First off, it's the 2006 edition of the Grind tour, featuring Canadian ska stalwarts Subb, Swedish skate-punk veterans Satanic Surfers (who neither surf nor practice any form of Satanism), and a couple of Fat bands, the lovable Loved Ones, and headliners Mad Caddies.  Friday then brings to town two of my favourite bands that I've never seen: Alkaline Trio and The Lawrence Arms.  I'm extremely excited to see both bands, and don't be too surprised if I don't have much of a voice come Saturday morning.  

Thursday brings round two of our pre-natal class.  I was thrilled and shortly after disappointed when while in the first class, noticed a guy with an uncanny resemblance to Simon Pegg (best known as the titular character from Shaun of the Dead).

Unfortunately, the guy's name turned out to be Devon.  No accent, either.  The nerve of some people, I tell ya.

All that plus I don't even know what I'm going to do for the long weekend! Maybe I'll just take it easy and see if I can wrangle up the second season of Curb Your Enthusiasm on DVD.  Larry David is my new idol.  I hope that when I'm old that I can be half as bitter and successful as him."

-Speaking of the music industry, i think 2006 is the year of Fat.  They've already put out releases ranging from very solid to amazing (The Loved Ones, The Sainte Catherines, The Lawrence Arms), have None More Black's sophomore full-length This is Satire coming out next week (which is also fuckin' rocking) and still have releases from Strike Anywhere, Smoke or Fire, and a live album from Against Me! to look forward to.  Top 3 so far: Lawrence Arms - Oh Calcutta, Armalite, and None More Black - This is Satire

-Arrested Development is the best TV show of all time, ever

I think the reason I haven't written anything in so long is because I didn't know how to properly put into words the one major thing that's been on my mind for the last 3 months and a bit.  That, of course, would be the fact that Mandy is having a baby and that I'm going to be a Dad.  

Whoa.  Talk about your world-turner-upside-downers.  I've gone through (and go through pretty much every day) a range of feelings ranging from suffocating fear and panic to reckless excitement.  I mean, I'm sure that's normal for people about to have a baby.  It's just not normal for me.  I never imagined being in this situation at this point in my life.  A year ago, the biggest things on my mind were that I was starting to hang out with Mandy again and Sin City.  Now, I'm trying to find a place for me, Mandy, and my impending bundle of joy (I hate that expression) to live before my current landlords kick me out, all the while trying to keep her family happy, my family happy, my boss happy, and my friends happy.  Sanity delicately teeters on the brink of extinction.  

I don't mean for this to come off as negative.  I really am looking forward to this and get excited thinking about it a lot.  I love Mandy and I will love the baby and I'll do everything I can to make us a happy family. 

Anyway, so that's the condensed version of why I haven't been updating.  I just felt stupid writing meaningless shit when I knew I should have been writing about what was really on my mind 99% of the time.  I just wasn't sure how to go about it, and I'm still not even after writing this, but I'll be damned If I'm going to delete it now.  So forgive the jumbled thoughts of this tired madman, and maybe now I can get back to talking about movies and music.

Speaking of which, Paint it Black was crazy.  What a night, what a night.  Aside from being one of, if not THE, most intense band I've ever seen, I got to actually talk to all the guys in the band, which was totally fucking cool.  I'm not really the type to get star-struck or gush about people in bands, but for christ's sake, Dan Yemin!  The guy's resume speaks for itself.  He's been in consistently amazing bands since before I had any clue what 'punk rock' was.  Not that I do now, but who the hell cares anyway?  ANYWAY, so I'm standing there shooting the shit with the good Doctor, and man, the guy is just completely cool.  Way more level-headed than he has any business being, boasting that kind of track record, but I'll take it.  Oh yeah, I'm really starting to dig the Armalite album, too.  The man can do no wrong.  It's just really good, grown-up pop punk from some dudes who love making music, and I fuckin' can't get enough of it.  I'm starting to think I really missed out on something with Atom and His Package and need to rectify that.  

Anyway, I guess this will do.  See ya in June!  (just kidding)...maybe.."

Wow, what an awesome weekend.  Friday night we celebrated Andy's birthday in style, shitfaced at Molly Bloom's with Andy eventually throwing up in the loo and us getting kicked out a little after 1 am.   I got home and in bed.  Fast-forward to Saturday morning, I notice Mandy beside me and half-remember her calling and coming over some time after I'd passed out.  Sweet deal.  Then the time comes and we go over to 'Pleasures of the Flesh'  around noon for my tattoo appointment.  

Ok, if you're going to get a tattoo, I do not recommend any of the following things:

- heavy drinking the night before
- not eating anything in the time between the heavy drinking and the tattoo

Actually, I guess you should only pay attention to the second one, because I'm sure some food would have made the whole stomach full of nothing but alcohol thing go away.  

Also, the rumors are true.. the back of the arm is considerably more painfulto get tattooed than right on the bicep.  Oh well, it wasn't <i>that</i> bad, and only lasts for a while.  

So Saturday night comes along and we all get dressed up..Mandy as Cruella Deville, Steve as Bo Duke, Andy as  a soccer hooligan/guy who got dragged out at the last minute/Captain England, and head to the Dirty Denim.  We meet up with Chris and Laura there.  Chris' costume was part of a sweet collaborative effort to do a (I think) porno version of Alice in Wonderland.  Congratulations to them for winning best group costume.  The Flintstones and Mario Kart groups were pretty awesome as well.  Also the Mariachi Band who made me an honourary member but got screwed in the voting.  I have to say though, the guy dressed as Ash (see: Evil Dead, Army of Darkness) had the most boss costume ever.  Chainsaw hand and all.  I didn't get a picture of him, but here's one of Ash, just because he's so tough.

            It shall be well with you this year. No matter how much your 
                    enemies try this year, they will not succeed. 
           You have been destined to make it and you shall surely achieve 
                              all your goals this year. 
           For the remaining months of the year, your problems will enter 
             Call blocking, your enemies will have network problems and 
           their bad wishes for you will enter into voicemail and you will 
                           only get them as missed calls. 
            All your agonies will be diverted and victory and prosperity 
                            will be your incoming calls! 

            Heavens have confirmed today the end of your sufferings sorrows 
             and pains because HE that sits on the throne has remembered 
                                        you. 
             He has taken away the hardships and given you JOY. He will 
                                 never let you down. 
             I knocked at heavens door this morning, God asked me... My 
                            child! what can I do for you? 
           And I said, Father, please protect and bless the person reading 
             this message... God smiled and answered... Request granted. 
           If you believe, send it to seven people and the one who sent it 
            to you. By doing this you have succeeded in praying for eight 
                                    people today. 
           Have a Blessed Day!!

- My new TV rocks, and my living room is awesome now.  Don't believe me?  I knew you wouldn't, because you never do so I took this picture to prove it.

- The play Andrew and I wrote, ""Do Lunch"", is actually happening.  It's going to be a part of the Georgetown Little Theatre youth one act play festival, so everyone book off December 1-3 so you can come see it all three nights.  It'll be worth it, because there will be muchos improv, assuring a different experience every time! That's our pitch!  Also it's really funny, so if you don't come you're a fucking humorless asshole.

- Strung Out fucking rocked.  They played pretty much everything I wanted to hear, save for 'mephisto'.  All the classics were covered though.. we got 'Exhumation of Virginia Madison', 'Ultimate Devotion', 'Firecracker', and closed with 'Matchbook' before coming back and playing 'Too Close To See' and a couple other tunes for an encore.  The new songs sounded great too, especially 'Analog' (which they opened with) and 'Her Name in Blood'.  It was seriously one of the best shows I've EVER been to (seems I say that a lot, but seriously..)  Comeback Kid were solid as always, even with the guitarist filling in for vocal duties, and Bane was better than when I saw them earlier in the year (which also happened to be with CBK.)  They played 'Both Guns Blazing', which is probably their best song and it was pretty awesome.  Strung Out definitely owned the place though.  Awesome show.

- Yeah that's it for now. One Love."

Saturday was fun too.. we saw Laura lose her consolation game for softball but it was OK because we got to heckle Elena and the umpire (BOCK!).  Also, Andy made the king of ""that's what she said"" jokes.  After that we got together at my place and enjoyed some refreshing beverages while taking in some Ong Bak (which, by the way, is 100 times funnier dubbed) before going to Shoeless Joe's and being treated to round after round of shots courtesy of Robbie.  Props to him for buying me lots of alcohol, and for throwing a cool little BBQ on Sunday.

Don't be too hasty while purchasing it, though.  You're never in too much of a rush to forget manners.  After that, sprint home and watch the film.  

This is Tony Jaa's (North American) debut and he is, rightfully so, being heralded as the next Bruce Lee.  The stunts he does in this movie will leave you in awe.  All these stunts, performed by Jaa himself, are also done without the use of computer effects or wires.  

You may be thinking to yourself, ""But Dan, what about plot?  Isn't there a story?""  To which my response is: plot?  Listen son, in a movie like this, the plot exists for one reason, and the reason is this:  To put the star in as many chase and fight scenes as possible, and to that end it succeeds.  You'll forget all about your precious storyline when you see the Jaa man crackin' dozens of skulls with his knees and elbows.  Or the part where he literally folds himself in half at full sprint to squeeze through a ring of barb wire <i>just because he can</i>.  Or when he lights his feet on fire and leaves his enemies beaten and charred.  Or when he runs up that one guy's back and runs over top of some hopeless goons' heads.  I could go on all day.

The bottom line is, if you like action movies and martial arts, this is the one to see.

"event","So we all know that Wheaties is the supposed ""Breakfast of Champions"".  What I don't get is, where's everyone else's breakfast?  Not everyone's a champion, and no number of bowls of Wheaties are going to change that.  I think Wheaties, and cereal companies in general, are missing out on a huge market by not targeting these people.  For instance, why not ""Breakfast of Runner-Ups""?  How about ""Breakfast of Honrouable Mentions""?  ""Breakfast of A for Efforts"", or even ""Breakfast of Dead Lasts"".  ""Breakfast of Losers"" sounds a bit harsh, but that's a huge untapped demographic.  Don't stop there though.  ""Breakfast of the Ones That Showed Up Late"", ""Breakfast of Couldn't Make it Out That Days"", and ""Breakfast of People That Didn't Give a Shit"" could all be successful, the latter especially, I think.  Even more specific than that, why not ""Breakfast of Arthritic Cripples"", ""Breakfast of Old Jaded Bastards"" or ""Breakfast of Relatives of Recently Deceased Who May Not Have Been Up To Running a Fuckin' Marathon on That Particular Morning""."

"event","I guess, in retrospect, going to KFC for lunch was my first mistake.  The second, and worst mistake, was not picking up on the subtle hint cleverly hidden in the name of the sandwich in question; <i>The Snacker</i>.  This would not be suitable as toddler's appetizer before a main course of a jar of vaguely-flavoured muck let alone a lunch for a <i>hulking behemoth</i> like me.  Here is a handy comparison I made to give you an idea of the size of The Snacker.  The following picture is to scale.

Don't buy The Snacker unless your normal meal is roughly the size of 1 (one) Canadian penny."

"event","Good weekend, despite the ass weather.  We got there Friday night sometime around 8:30 I think, and hung out with my Dad for a bit, shooting the crap and playing guitar.  Well, him and Steve played guitar, Andy and I just made jokes and mock attempts at the ol' axe.  After a few hours of that and a few brews, we called it a night and retired to the cottage.  
We all woke up fairly early on Saturday and decided to drive into Parry Sound for some breakfast and to visit Ben and Dominic.  That was fun, Dominic was awesome as usual, and Ben was hungover as a sonofabitch.  Oh, and there was a girl at Wendy's who looked pretty much exactly like April.  

After a while, we drove back to my Dad's place.  It was cool and overcast, but that didn't stop Steve and I from jumping in the lake (albeit briefly).  The water was fucking frigid, so I went in first and swam straight for the dock and got out.  As I was walking, shivering, past Steve, I told him the water was nice, so just run and jump in.  

As he's running down the dock Andy asks how the water is.  ""God damn cold"", I tell him, and he laughs, just as Steve is jumping off the end of the dock.  Steve gets out of the water and makes a bee line for the cottage and says ""I knew it was gonna be bad when I heard Andy laugh as I was jumping.""  Moral of the story?  Tricking people is fun. 

The rest of the weekend wasn't too eventful.. we went for a little boat ride and went to the diving cliff, but I was the only one that jumped.  Andy and Steve are a couple of Grade A Pussies, that much is clear now.  Then neither of them were feeling well so they ditched out on the bonfire pretty early.  I stayed for another hour or so, then went down to the cottage with them and chilled for a bit before bed.

Sunday we just chilled for a bit and had breakfast/lunch, chilled for a bit more then said our goodbyes and farewells.  Oh, and they didn't bring me a sombrero back from Mexico.  OR tequila.  What the fuck's up with that?

I'm tired right now and my legs hurt.  At least I can imagine how Steve's back and ribs feel, and it makes me feel better.  

Recap: last night Steve and I had a Herculean brawl on an epic scale worthy of mythological greek metaphors.  It was gruelling and barbaric and, although I was the victor, Steve should have no shame in the loss.  He fought hard and heroically, and should hold his head up high.  As he walks down loser lane.

"event","So I'm back in Milton earlier today.  I am at a terminal just off of Thompson, running a jumper for a routine install.  Up walk two Entourage thugs who start going through the usual bullshit they talk about.  I try to hurry up because I just want to get out of there, then the guy in the silver pick-up from yesterday drives by on Thompson and I hear the guy yell ""we're comin' to get ya"".  At this point I start packing my shit up and closing the doors to the terminal, but the jumper wire is going from my bag to the terminal so I had to re-open the door and cut the wire.  I do that and start walking to the van as the guy makes a comment about me being done so soon.  As I get into the van, the silver pick-up comes around the corner and parks perpendicular to me, blocking the whole street, then turns to the side and reverses right in front of me, and I notice another truck pull up right behind me.  So now I'm blocked in.  Fuckin' great.  I look in the rear view and then up to the truck in front, and realize that with the two guys on foot there are seven guys in two vehicles surrounding me.  I lock the door and pick up the cell phone and call my manager.  I tell him what's going on and he says he's going to call back in a minute.  He hangs up, and one of the guys comes up and makes a motion for me to roll down the window, so I roll it down a bit and ask what he wants, and he says, ""you don't know what this is about?""

""I know you guys have a problem with Bell, but I have nothing to do with that.  I'm just doing my job"", I tell him.

He tells me it's nothing personal.  Then, I'm guessing because he saw me on the phone and probably assumed I was calling the cops, he tells me that they're not threatening me.

That just pushes me over the deep end.  I tell him like fuck I'm not being threatened.  

""There are seven of you surrounding me and blocking me in here.  That guy that fucking followed me around and made a gun motion at me yesterday just yelled 'We're comin to get you' at me.  How the fuck am I not being threatened?""

He doesn't really give me an answer, but goes and confers with the cunt that followed me around yesterday.  Then that guy comes up to the window and tells me that they're going to let me go, so I say OK and watch the guy walk up to his truck and pull up a few feet.  Then he gets out of the truck again and says ""I suggest you go home"".  I tell him I'll think about it, then him and a couple of the other guys walk right in front of my van.  I swear I've never been so tempted to run anyone over.  

""If you're going to let me go get the fuck out of the way"", I yell at them and eventually they meander out of my way.

I'm less than a block away and my manager calls me back, telling me to call dispatch and tell them I can't complete the job because of picketers and to assign me a different one, and if anyone follows me, he gives me the number for the Halton Regional Police.  I thank him and tell him I'm going to go to Tim Horton's or somewhere else public to call in, and if they follow me there I'll call the cops.  

As I'm on the phone, I notice the silver pick-up is parked behind me again, so I pull away and turn onto Thompson, and he follows up to the lights, then gets beside me.  He gives me a death stare so I figure it's as good a time as any for a little mockery.  As he's staring me down I do the little gun motion with my hand.  

I'm definitely getting my ass kicked if I go back to Milton.  I'm seriously considering bringing a bat or something tomorrow."

"event","I was sitting in the van, on the north-east corner of Thompson and Derry.  The hold music that is usually reserved for elevators in retirement homes just looping endlessly.  What is taking John so long?  He said he was right around the corner.  I hear an engine and glance in the rear-view mirror.  A silver pick-up truck.  
""Not John"", I thought to myself.  Probably another picketer.  I continue waiting on hold, occasionally glancing back to the silver pick-up.  The guy, whoever he is, just sitting there.  The next time I look in the mirror he's talking on the phone.  I check the side mirror and notice that he's looking right at me in the same mirror.  
""Proxy, Janet speaking.""  I had tuned out the hold muzak and her voice broke the silence suddenly, startling me.  I'd nearly forgot why I was calling in the first place, but then snap back to reality and ask her a series of questions regarding the phone line I was sent to repair.  As I'm scribbling down the numbers she's reading to me, A van pulls up in front of me.  John.  I say thank you and hang up as John walks up to my van.  He asks who's in the pick-up.  I shrug.
""He's just been sitting there for about 10 minutes"" I tell him.  
""Probably a picketer.  You find out the problem?""
""Yeah, I'm at the wrong terminal.  I just need to go up the road.""
""Alright"", he says.  ""Just call me if you've got any other problems.""  I say OK and he goes back to his van, and pulls away from the side of the road.  I check my mirror and pull a U-turn right into a red light.  While I'm stopped I look back and see the silver pick-up pull away from the side and make a U-turn.  He stops right behind me.  The light turns green so I go through the intersection.
He's following me. 
I periodically check the rear-view with the intervals between glances getting shorter and shorter.  I miss my turn.
Still following.
I make a right onto Britannia.
He makes a right onto Britannia.
I come to a red light at Britannia and Ontario Street.  I turn right, and he follows.  Traffic is a little thicker on Ontario, plus there's the luxury of an extra lane.  I use the lane to pass two cars in front of me and then I get back into the left lane.  He's a couple cars back now, but I can still see him in the mirror, so I know he can still see me.  We continue like this for a few blocks until Ontario ends at Steeles.  I get into the left-hand turn lane and check my mirror, but can't see him.  I check the passenger side mirror and spot him coming up beside me.  He stops right beside me, and makes a gun with his hand and does the universal sign for ""I'm going to shoot you"" then swerves over to the right-hand turn lane and heads east.  
My prior trepidation suddenly turns into fury.  <i>You think you can intimidate me, you dickless son of a bitch?  Get back on the phone and call your friends.</i>
I crank the wheel and push down on the gas, and the tires squawk and spin.  The back end slides out so I crank the wheel to the left to straighten out.  I watch the needle on the speedometer climb and the white lines on the street are going by faster and faster.  The back of the silver pick-up is getting closer and closer.  He's stopped at a red light.  I switch lanes and slam on the brakes and squeal to a stop beside him.  I put it in park and unbuckle my seat belt while I reach for the door handle with my other hand.  I see a surprised look on his face when he looks over to see me reaching for his passenger door.  He reaches for the lock but I've already started pulling it open.  
His demeanor calm again, he says ""You don't know who you're fucking with, kid.""
About the time he finishes his sentence I reach into his cab with my knee on the passenger seat and with all my weight I slam my fist into his jaw.  He's still got his seat belt on so I unbuckle it and grab the back of his head and slam it into the steering wheel.  He reaches for the shifter and pushes it into first and peels off.  Momentum and gravity do their things and I find myself holding onto the swinging passenger door with my feet dragging along the asphalt.  I can feel the tendons and muscles inside my arm stretching.  They're burning like hell while I hold on.  I'm starting to lose my grip on the door handle and for the first time think that maybe I should have maybe thought this idea through a little better.  
No time for second-guessing now.  My arms are burning and aching from holding onto the door the way I imagine Nolan Ryan's did after he pitched his last no-hitter.  The truck swerves to the right and then violently to the left, and as the door swings back towards the cab I use my last bit of strength to pull myself up and into the cab.  I grab onto the holy shit bar and get a foot on the floor.  I'm met with a hard punch to the side of the head.  And another.  I feel myself start to fall back but out of instinct I slam the door shut to avoid falling out of the cab again.  Another punch.  This one connects with my jaw with quite a bit of force.  I'm definitely wishing I'd developed the plan a little more thoroughly now.  Before another fist connects I grab the steering wheel and pull it hard to the right.  The truck starts to fish-tail and the back end slams into a stoplight and everything goes black.  
When I come to, I lift my forehead away from the dashboard and shake the broken glass off of my arms and lap.  I rub my eyes and look to my left.  
What I see is an empty seat where there should be a person.  I look ahead and see a train wreck of a man lying on the road.  
I can tell he doesn't want any more of this, so I open my door and step out of the cab and stretch.  I walk west towards the sun which is setting, by the looks of it, at the end of the street.  I get back to the van and go to open the door.  I notice the keys locked inside and I curse my impulsiveness as I walk across to a payphone to call a taxi."

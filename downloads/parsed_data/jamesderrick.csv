"event","This is so cool i now have my website well sorta any way i would like to thank hannah for telling me about www.livejournal.com (very cool of you).Right anyways I suppose i should put somin in this thing seen as it is a diary.Well I have recently come back from Belgium and france it was really cool except for those bloody French beggars  I mean they had clothes and pennies isn't that enough?I went on space mountain 7 times I went on pirates of the carribean once and the haunted mansion which wasn't really scary which was a bit of a letdown but it was still great.I made loads of new friends on holiday like Carl,Hannah,Jennifer,Sophie,farmer Jiles(dan)Jack,Jade and matt.Today i have just been chilling around the house really nothing interesting except that my dog tore up a newspaper.Well thats about all that has happened today.  Also after every entry i am goping to put some sort of proverb or something which should be quite interesting well tara."

"event","Oohkayy. So I had about the best day of my life today! Cooper(the new volleyball coach) worked us HARD today. It was SO hot. Geez. I was so nervous about making the team. After tryouts&nbsp;I came home and went to Laurels with Jessie and we went to West. I was so happy when I found out I made varsity again. After we saw the teams posted we went to target, hobby lobby, then the pool. The pool was fun. It was literally the last day of summer. This weekend I'm supposedly going out with someone to hang out. lol, girly face. I'm on an all-time high right now. Nothing can bring me down. I was hurting, really hurting. But I've realized where my priorities are and all the wonderful people I have whenever I need them. I hope they know I'm always here and wanting to help them too. Volleyball is gonna be amazing this season, I can tell. I just have that feeling. I think/hope I'll get to play a lot! School starts in 2 weeks, so much at one time! Permit, volleyball, guy. Whew, I'm excited. Every muscle aches on my body but its a good kind of hurt. I'm so happy, so alive. I've never felt this great. Yay. =D"

"event","What a day. Woke up at 7:30, went to West for the first day of volleyball tryouts. They were SO different this year. We have a new coach, and its a young guy! I'm not sure if thats a good or bad thing quite yet. After that Jasmine and I went to the Y and practiced. We had the whole gym to ourselves until some guys started playing basketball but they were very nice. I can't get certain things out of my head, no matter how hard I try to not think about it(them). We only have 2 days of tryouts this year, so thats all I should have my mind on. Tomorrow after tryouts Laurel, Jessie, and I are goin to Laurels house to practice and spend the night and watch the ringer =]. Jasmine is still determined to hook me up with this one guy but I'm just not ready. I know we're teenagers and relationships mean nothing to most people but I'm just so cautious these days its pitiful. I have a bruise on my wrist the size of a tennis ball, no lie. But I love it. I love volleyball, I'm convinced its the sport for me. Just because I truly desire it. I've had some crazy dreams lately. I mean every night! I never dream that much. Well I think I'm gonna go take a hot bath, my muscles hurt. Byee =]"

"event","6:28 p.m. Just took a shower, unfortunately the knob is broken! Other than an incredibly freezing shower..pretty good day. Volleyball tryouts are Wednesday now? Gosh, I wish they would give us more knowledge on school events. You know, sometimes I think being single is like a lifestyle. Independent lifestyle, that is. Always talking and thinking about your friends or family rather than a boyfriend. I guess that's a good thing. Sometimes I want to have it all. But don't we all? Eh, I'm happy with what I got. I have some of the best friends in the entire world (: Jessica, Lyndsey, Dale, Patrick, Nick. Gosh, I'm lucky. I don't know why they put up with me. Especially Dale, I complain more to him than a prisoner. I'm still really glad they all do though. Last night I started thinking about this year, senior year, college, the future. I started planning it all out. Suddenly I realized only the Lord knows what will happen, no matter how hard to try and prepare yourself. Everything happens for a reason, we've all heard it. But how do or will we ever know for sure? I guess we don't. That's where faith steps in I suppose. I hope I'm close to all the people I am now 10 years from now. Well I will make sure of it. Lets hope they feel the same way. Well, dad's taking me driving, yay! Later."

"event","<p>It's 11:15 on Sunday morning. Dad and I got up too late, moms at work so we couldn't go to church like planned. Volleyball tryouts tomorrow from what I've been told. Jasmine's as nervous as I was last year. It feels as though the summer has blinked and waved goodbye already. So many memories, but they might as well be lost forever. I wish I had traveled some. Gone to Asheville like I wanted to with a friend. Sometimes I feel like there should be more than the city. Day after day, we just keep going. We're never completely able to sit down and enjoy any possible beauty around us. Dale and I agree that the mountains are the most calming place. The beach is great, who doesn't like the beach? But its fun and busy. I don't think calming has to be boring. It can just be enjoying things we usually don't. Appreciating. Lately, I've thought a lot. I've thought a lot about the past and shouldn't. I guess when you don't want to think about something you can't exactly control it. Jasmine told me yesterday you most likely will never be over someone until you find someone else. Again, it made me think. What if we can get over the person sooner than getting over what you had? In my case, I think its happened before. Its not impossible to get over someone. But initially getting over what you had, memories, and the situation you were in is the hardest. Knowing you're alone, or at least not having a significant other signifies the start of a depressing time. Although I've experienced somewhat of a slump in the recent weeks, I'm being optimistic. There are actually a lot of things I'm looking forward to this year. Not being a freshman's a start. There are a few people I'd like to become close to again, and some I'd just like to get to know better. School's gonna be hard, all honors. Well I think I'm gonna go practice serves. </p>"

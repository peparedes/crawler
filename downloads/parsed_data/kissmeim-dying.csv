<br>I miss it so much I can barely stand it. I had the time of my life. I made so many friends and created so many memories that will last my lifetime. Most of all, I miss the friends that I had during the summer. It seems like everyone who I hungout with, I don't anymore... which is incredably despressing. I guess that's mostly my fault though, right? I mean, maybe I dropped them, or didn't communicate well enough how much they truely ment to me. I'd like to think that I'm a better friend than that, but don't we all. I guess now there's not too much I can do about it.

I've never even gotten a B in math before... and  when my teacher handed me a progress report, I was excited to have a 75. Since 8th grade my mom has always preached to me about getting good grades so that I could get into college, and now that I've reached that goal, I'm like now what? I guess this is what happens to every senior, hence senioritis?

Yesterday was my first and, sadly, my last Kodan Armada show. I've
heard about their shows before; about how everyone cries at the end and
is so moved by the set. I never fully believed that until last night.
The things that were said and the emotions that filled the room were
unspeakable. If you haven't been to one of their shows before, then I
can't expect you to understand. It really made me start to appreciate
how easy I have it and how much so many people mean to me. Through
everything that I've been through, and through everything that I'm
going to go through, I hope that you all stay apart of my life. I am

I got a scholarship to Lake Erie, but I'm not ready to leave yet. Expecially to go to a different state and basically start a new life. 7 hours is a pretty long drive and, not to mention, that it's FREEZING up there. Everyone always talks about getting out of here, but no one ever really does... I guess that's how it is with me. Or maybe it's just reality starting to hit. Its like my entire school career has been worked up to college. Everything I did, I did it well so that I could get into college. But now that I'm getting into college and actually having to face that, I have no idea what to do or what I want to do. That probably doesn't make any sense, but oh well.

"event","I'm in a really weird mood right now.
I'm not upset, but im not in a good mood either. It's like im... gloomy. Thats it, I'm gloomy. I really have no reason to be... I guess I'm just thinking about stuff too much.
Today, I helped my cousin learn how to ride a bike. She fell off alot, but she got pretty good by the time I left. Seeing her in her knee pads and helmet made me really miss being a kid. That's all I ever did was ride my bike and rollerblade. Her biggest fear was scraping her hands and falling off... and everytime she did, she'd get back on. I guess it just amazes me that in a span of about 5 years, you can almost totally loose that childhood innocense. 
High school seems over-rated. Even the people who I thought were my friends seem two-faced. Its like people are afraid to tell you how they really feel, so they end up gossiping behind your back and spreading rediculous rumors. but thats all they are, just rumors based on complete lies. Then, of course, everyone believes rumors, because it's highschool. oh well.."

"event","I'm sick of being sick. My mom took me back to the immediate care center today. The doctor told me that my glands were pretty swollen and that my white blood cell count was too high. He said that my strep probably came back and that even though i got a shot, it probably wasnt enough. He said it was probably worse than they orginally thought, so they gave me two prescriptions and a spray thingy (i love those technical terms!). The nurse also drew my blood.. I've never gotten it done before, but it wasnt as horribly awful as i thought. Strep is probably one of the worst feelings ever.. I just wish it'd go away. :\
but anyways, I love doing these things! so, make me feel better and just do it..
1. Reply with your name and I will write something random about you.
2. I will then tell you what song/movie reminds me of you.
3. I will pick a flavor of jello to wrestle with you in.
4. I will say something that only makes sense to you and me.
5. I will tell you my first memory of you.

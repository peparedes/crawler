<strike>Kaneda, I just wanted to say I'm <i>sorry</i>, I was an idiot and I know it and I wish there was something I could say to you that would make it all better.

But I don't know <i>what</i>, and I don't know if it can happen if you're really scared of me. I don't want to force you to do anything you don't want to, ever, and I'm being pressured by people to make up with you but I don't want to if you really don't want to make up with me.

If you're happy seperated, then good.

The kid needs some time away from all of you people harassing him and bothering him about stuff he shouldn't have to worry about, so I'm giving him a break as captain and senpai and friend. Those of you who have my cell number are welcome to call me if anything comes up.

<lj-cut text=""Private to the team except for Dan"">Be careful. Sengoku-san and Akutsu-san aren't happy with me right now, so there's a chance that they might take it out on you guys. Anything suspicious or crazy happens and I want you to call me, right away. No expections to time or place. I won't let anything happen to you guys, whether or not I'm there.</lj-cut>

Apparently Atobe's holding some sort of tennis tournament. I'm expecting all of you in St. Rudolph to enter and do us proud. In light of that, practice tomorrow, on the indoor courts. If you have a problem with that, bring it to me beforehand. Otherwise, no exceptions.

Also, Kaneda and I...um...nevermind. Let's just say I'm good at screwing things up."

Just a note for the future. I'm here now, having fished the invitation out of the trash where my brother was ""hiding"" it. 

My friends list is also being stupid. I don't give a damn about it right now. I'll fix it later.

Oh, and team? Ten laps. All of you."

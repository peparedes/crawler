Yesterday was my 23rd birthday. I really didn't do anything for the special day. I worked, came home, surfed the net, watched some TV, ate dinner, took a nap, woke up at 9pm, had cake & ice cream, surfed online again and went to bed. Not a real exciting birthday but mine never are. I will have fun on Saturday night when me, my sister, my sister-in-law and April(nicksextoy) go out to the club. Because we will be clubbing! LOL!

Monday night was great. The WWE came to St Louis for their Monday night show---Monday Night RAW. Besides all the great WWE action, the best part of the show had to be when my man John Cena was on RAW. Now most of you guys are scratching your head because you have heard me mention that John Cena is on Smackdown...so I'm sure you're asking yourself..what the hell is he doing on Smackdown? Well the WWE had their annual draft and John was the first Smackdown superstar drafted to RAW. How cool is that? I was hoping that he would ahve come out, said his peace and went to the back but they announced that he is part of the RAW roster. My baby come out, cut a promo, got confrontation with Jay Reso a.k.a Christian & Tyson Tomko, and took his shirt off. My boy still has that banging body. DAMN! 

Well thats it for now. I'm talk to ya'll later."

Nothing has really happen in my life since the last time I wrote you. 

I attended my friend Mel and Jeremy's wedding on May 7th. I must admit that it was a very nice wedding. Mel looked fabulous and Jeremy looked very handsome. 

I stopped liking Shelton Benjamin and began to like John Cena again. It all started when I saw John on this late night show last Thursday and he was just being the John Cena that I loved. Not the rapper that the WWE protrays him as. He was the cute, adorable guy that I used to have a crush on. 

Speaking of John, his rap album came out last Tuesday. It's okay. There are a few songs that I like. I'd give the album *** 3/4 stars. It sold 43,000 in its first week and its #15 on the Billboards top 200. Sine I'm not into music satistics, I'm not sure if either figure is good. I'm just glad to be part of the Chain Gang and supportin my boy. 

Well gotta go.

Work has been the same as always. One good thing that I am picking up on more hours. Which is always good because more hours means more money and more money means Erica gets new clothes. LOL! MY job will be moving to an office at the begining of next month. The cool part is that the new office is like 3 or 4 minutes from my house(driving distance) and like 15 minutes in walking distance. Which is like really cool because I'm trying to loose a little weight so the walk won't be bad. As long as the weather cooperates. 

For those of you who read mt last journal and the fact that I stated that I was having problems chosing a crush. I made my decision Tuesday morning... the winner is Shelton Benjamin. I just keep dreaming about him all Monday night. I very excited with the fact that he is the new guy in my life. The only bad part is that he is 30 years old and has a daughter... well actually thats not really a bad thing because like Aaliyah said: ""age ain't nothing but a number"" and him and his ""baby mama"" aren't togeter. She lives in NV and he lives in MN. So its all good in the hood. LOL! 

Well gotta go."

I have a few videos of my new guy Shelton Benjamin on WWE Experience and then on Sunday Night Heat. He looked super cute as always. :)

I also saw some clips on John Cena on WWE Experience today as well. He looked cute as always. I'm so glad that he won the WWE championship. 

I gave my girl April a.k.a Nickysextoy her birthday present. It was 3 pics of her man Nick Carter. It was very drool worthy to her. Ewww to me but it is different strokes for different folks. 

I have been thinking about my new crush Shelton and my old one John. I really like them both and I can't chose one. Does that make any sense? I'm not really a person who has two or 3 crushes, I'm a one crush women. LOL! Well anyways.. there are things that I like about Shelton and there are things that I like about John. Of coarse I really can't let one of them go. I can I can try something new and have two guys. Of coarse that really doesn't sound like a good idea. 

Well gotta go.

It has been a few weeks since I've last written. A lot has happen in the wrestling world as well as my life(well not that much with my life unless you count a new crush...LOL)

My boy John Cena won the WWE championship at Wrestlemania 21. Just as I predicted that he would. The match was short but I'm glad that he won. He says that he is going to ice out the WWE championship. If it is anything like what he did to the US title then it will be very interesting to see. 

One of ""my North Carolina boys"" Matt Hardy was released from the WWE yesterday. It all over some crap and I have offically seen a new low in the WWE. *cries*

My girl Molly was released from her WWE contract today. I'd be upset but she asked to be released. *shrugs my shoulders*

I began to have a crush on another wrestler named Shelton Bejamin. He is a cutie pie. 

Sorry to keep it so short peeps but I gotta jet."

"event","Hello world. It's your future WWE Diva here again. Cold.. very cold might I addd. The reason that I am cold is because the pilot light went out on our water heater. So I had to take an ice cold shower this morning. Then it is probaly only like 40 degrees outside. So It's very cold this morning. There is suppose to be someone coming over to light the pilot light but I'm sure that he won't get here until like 2 or 3 this afternoon. As long as I can get a hot shower tonight, that's all I care about. LOL! 

My weekend has been good so far. I was off yesterday due to Good Friday. I really didn't do anything, I was lazy all day. LOL! Besides the ice cold shower, this morning has been very good. I'm going to church tomorrow and the I'll be having dinner with my Godparents and my godbrothers. 

I saw my ""husband"" on Smackdown Thursday night. He is such a cutie pie. I gotta luv him. They have this rule where he can't hit JBL(his oppenent at Wrestlemania) or he will lose his number 1 contender spot at Wrestlemania. The General Mananger Thedore Long did state that if JBL hits Joohn first then John has the right to defend himself. So anyways... John was tormenting the hell out of JBL on Smackdown. He pierced hole in JBL's tire on his limo, he wrote JBL sucks in stray paint on the side of the limo, he cut JBL's tie, he put 2 pitchers of water in JBL's ""10 gallon"" hat, he spray pained a yellow strreak down JBL's back and then he spray painted FU(the title of his signature move) on the front of JBL's shirt. All so that JBL could hit him so that he beat the living hell out of him. I love my baby but he was bad that night. I must admit that it was funny though. 

8 days until WRESTLEMANIA! I am so excited! I can't wait! John Cena is going to beat JBL and walk out with of the staples Center as the new WWE CHAMPION! You got boy! YEAH!

Well gotta go peeps.

Today actually has been a really good day. I woke up at 5:30am, exercised, showered, worked for 4 hours, came home, at lunch, napped, went to dinner with my sis and nephew, lifted weights, and now I'm just chilling. 

I got some very shocking news yesterday but there was a good ending to the news. Well one of ""my North Carolina boys"" Shannon Moore was involved in a car accident. He had a head on collision with a drunk driver. I am just thankful that he was driving his hummer that day, otherwise he may have been dead. I'd hate to ever think about that. :(

I saw some pics of my ""husband"" John Cena. He looked hot as also. Ha ha ha.. you peeps thought I was going to go one journal entry with out talking about him. I think not. LOL! Anyways... I was sitting at work this morning and I began to think about him. I was kind of acting like a high school girl, who was just gazing at her crush with love in her eyes. LOL

10 more days until Wrestlemania XXI. I can't wait. My baby is going to win the WWE championship. YEAH!

Well gotta go.

"event","Soruy. I haven't written in a long time guys. I actually forgotten that I'd even had a acct until today. I was surfing for some sites of one of my ""boys from da WWE"" Shannon Moore and I came across some site called blurty. Which actually reminds me of livejournal. So I checked out ""his"" (or the guy pretending to him) profile and then I remebered that I had an acct with livejournal. So I hopped on and here I am. LOL! 

Nothing interesting has going on in my life. Just the same old same old. 

My boss is driving me crazy. I wish I could find new job but there isn't much luck in the old ville. I really think that he has problems. One minute, he is all happy go lucky and the next minute he is trying to bite my head off. We almost went at it on Monday. I'm just glad that I kep a cool head. Otherwise he's be laying on the floor with his head busted open and I'd be sitting in the back of a police car. Anyways... I won't go into the details. All I can say is that today, he was acting like he was my bestfriend. Man that dude has issues!

For any of the wrestling fans who read this: There is 12 DAYS until WRESTLEMANIA 21! For the non WWE fans, the reason that that is such a big deal is because Wrestlemania is like the Superbowl or the World Series but for wrestling. It is the only time of the year where RAW wrestlers can fight Samckdown wrestlers(the company is divided into two brands- the RAW and Samckdown brand) or as we fans call them interpromotional matches. This year, another one of ""my boys from da WWE) Randy Orton will be fighting the Undertaker. The name alone should be scary. LOL! Neways.. Randy smacked the Undertaker last week on Smackdown and the ""shoot"" a bolt of lighting at Randy or at least he tried to scare him. Of caorse the Legend Killer (Randy's nickname) was back on point last night when he hit his finishing move(the RKO) on his ""girlfriend"" Stacy Keibler. It was shocking. He hit it to quickly and she really sold the move. It was all part of the show, so I'm not going to worry too much about her health. I'm sure the dear is brusied and a little sore but I'm sure that she will live. 

NE ways.. on to the most important match on the Wrestlemania card. ""My husband"" John Cena is facing JBL for the WWE CHAMPIONSHIP! I have so much faith that he is walking out of the Staples Center as the WWE champion. I told my sis that if he wins then I will go through the cycle(screaming at the top of my lungs, crying and then being so proud of him.) I wish that I could be there to him live but I can't find tcikets, hotel or airfare. Mainly because I am too cheap to pay for high priced tickets, hotel and ect. LOL! Also I can't find a flight that will get me home for work the following Monday. Oh well. I'll watch it at home on TV. 

Well gotta go."

I got some sad news Sunday night that my girl April's doggies Gizzie died. She called me and I was crying as she was telling me the news. Poor gizzie. He was as cute as a button. My boss has a yorkie that has jair over her eyes and everytime I looked at her on Monday, I would think of Gizzie and would get teary eyed. 

My boy(a.k.a misteriess) Randy Orton won the World Heavyweight Championship at summerslam on August 15th. I was so excited for him. I wsa there and I screamed at the top of my lungs when he won. 

I haven't seen my ""husband"" John Cena since Sunday afternoon. He looked so vute on Smackdown! He is one and a million and I hope that I get to meet him sooner or later.

Speaking of meeting, I meet WWE superstars Kurt Angle, Trish Stratus, and Edge at WWE Summerslam. They were so nice and funny.

"event","Gemini Turn-ON'S: Keep Mercurial Geminians totally involved, completely busy and they are likely to be or to remain turned on. This is not always an easy job; but if you can do it, it may prove quite worthwhile if they mean that much to you. Communication also turns on these natives, but it is perhaps better if you allow them to do most of the talking. Lively conversation, regardless of whether or not it really leads anywhere, is very appealing to members of this third-house sign. However, the new and most current subjects, even a bit of gossip now and then, normally fascinate these naturally curious natives. Geminian are also quite pleased if you will suggest places to go and will accompany them on these excursions. Always be on the lookout and point out anything interesting along the way which perchance they might not notice.

Gemini Turn-OFF'S: If you would avoid turning off Gemini friends, whatever your relationship, you will make certain that the relationship is never lacking in newness and variety, for a repeat of the same old things and approaches--the same greetings, same conversation topics, going to the same places, seeing the same friends, playing the same games--tends to bore them to the point of actually getting on their nerves. In essence, sameness and routine are Gemini people's really big turn-offs."

"event","Hello once again peeps. Today has been okay. It could have been better but I'm alive and not deathly ill, so I won't complain. Let's get this show on the road.

I got an e-mail from my best friend today. I was glad of that because I hadn't heard from her since last Thurday and I was worried that there may have been something wrong. Of coarse there wasn't, her computer was/is screwed up. 

I'm watching my nephew sitting on the floor playing with his sleeper(I don't ask questions, I'm just here.) Yesterday, we went to my Godmother's house to enjoy the Memorial day festivites and i put him in the biuncer and my godmother told me that there was a button that played music on the bottom of the bouncer, I looked all over for it and couldn't find it. The last time i lifted the bottom up to check, Josh out his finger under the seat and got his finger smashed. I felt really bad after that, I should have been more careful but the little one did make it out alive without having to go to the hospital. 

I was watching TV last night and my sister asked me did I catch any hints that a family friend Chris was throwing. I told her that I did but with the path that both of us are on in our lives we would never work out. I say that because he is 23 and a minister and I'm 21 and not saved. I used to be at one time but I backslide (that's when you turn your back on the saved life and go back out into the ""world."") Chris is cute and he's a great guy but with us being not on the same path, I'd hate to do or say anthing that would make him turn back to his wicked ways and go back into the ""world"" himself. 

I saw a video of my ""husband"" John Cena today. I can't wait until the 13th when the WWE comes to Saint Louis. I also can't wait until Summerslam. I wuill have a chance to see my husband twice this summer. 

I am unsure of my decision with the RAW Divas Contest. I was never too thrilled about being a manager but I went for it anyways because it is one ticket that will get me in the door. I saw a commercial for it last night and they showed all these girls in bikinis and they were the skinny bimbos. I began to thinkt hat I don't want to be chosen because of my looks, I want to be picked because i kick ass and take numbers. So I really hope that they don't pick me becaus eI want to be a WWE diva for many reasons but my looks not being one of them. 

I don't mean to be rude but I gotta be skitting. I got a room to clean and an hour and the half workout to kill.

It frooze and then I couldn't get it to shut down. I shut it down by pressing the off button and then I couldn't get the damn thing to load back up. Finally after 10 times, the damn thing loaded back up and I made sure the first thing that I did was uninstall that damn screen saver. 

But I'm better now. So I'll move on....

I went to one of my fav wrestler's website and there was a link to his brother's tribute website and they had the best saying on the site. It said:
I will remember you.
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by.
Weep not for the memories will remember you...

I never got to see Russ as a wrestler but I'm sure that he will be missed by his brother, the rest of the Haas family and his friends. :(

Anyways.. I'll move on before I begin to cry...

I was walking from the store eariler today (after I'd seen two guys--one my siter knew and the other I knew his face but I couldn't put a name to it... like it really matters because both were trying to hit on me and I wasn't interested.) Anyways.. I'm getting off track... Like I said, I was walking home and the thought of my husband (not John Cena) and I began to wonder when I was going to met him. I mean I'm not getting any younger. I'm not saying that I'm going to run out and marry the first Joe Blow that I see. I know that's not going to happen because i'm too picky to just do that. i began to wonder if maybe i had missed him because i was too worried about other things. 

after that, i began to think about crushes and then celebrity crushes. i thought to myself that celebrity crush are the best crushes becuause you never have to ""deal"" with the individual all the time. the only bad time you have is whwen you find out that they have a gf. of coarse it matters who it is, as to whether or not you will care. LOL! I had a crush on jeff hardy and when i found out he had a gf, it crushed me but I continued to like him. Now when i found out that Randy Orton had a gf, I dropped him like a bad habit. LOL!

I can't go a whole journal entry without talking about my ""husband"" (baby, buggdie, honey, hubby, man, boy or whatever i feel like calling him at the moment--LOL!) John Cena. I found another hot pic of him today. He beat Rene Dupree in a lumberjack match on Smackdown the other night. Damn!! John was looking good! LOL.

Well peeps... I don't mean to be ruse but I got to be skitting.

"event","I remember when I was younger my mom used to call her journal/diary the Twilight Zone. So I thought that I would call mine Twilight Zone II.

I used to write ina diary when I was younger but as I've gotten older, it has become so passe. The sad thing was that when I was younger, I was less stressed because I always wrote all my thoughts down and I didn't let them build up until I burst(like I do now.)
   
I have so many things running through my mind that it is hard to concetrate on one thing. I hope this works. I'll jsut start witht he first thing that comes to mind and then I'll just work from there.
   
I just stepped on the scale and it said 152.5 pounds. Now I'm sure you guys are wondering why I care about that. I started the year out at 172 pounds and now I have lost almost 20 pounds. I do care about my weight but I don't let it control my life. I try to eat a well balanced die and I exercise on a daily basics. If I gain a pound a two its no big deal. I try not to make a big deal about it because I could be back at 200 pounds like I was in December of 2000. I think as long as I eat semi healthy and exercise I should be fine and I know as soon as I slack on one or the other that I will gain the weight back. 
   
I entered the WWE's RAW Diva Search contest today. I have always wanted to have a career in the WWE since I was 11. It started out as me wanting to be a valet/manager then a announcer and last but least a wrestler. The Diva search si offering a one year cotract but you get to be a valet/manager not a wrestler. I wasn't too wild and crazy about the whole thing last night when I first heard about it. My inital thought was that I didn't want to prance around the ring rootng for Billy Bob Japsafat as he wrestled. I wanted to be in the ring kicking ass and taking numbers. Then I thought about both Lita and Victoria. Who both started their careers in non-wrestling roles and now both of them are wrestlers (If you want to call Lita a wrestler.) Victoria who started her career out as one of the Godfather's(a wrestler who's characther was a pimp) hos and now she is WWE women's champion then there is a shot for me. Of coarse I'm sure they  won't let me wrestle until my one year talent contract (as they are calling it) is over. Who knows though.... we'll jsut have to wait and see what happens.....
   
Speaking of the WWE, I have about 3 weeks until the SmackDown roster comes to Saint Louis. I am so excited because my ""husband"" John Cena will be there. I always buy a new outfit when the WWE comes. I decided to wear my John Cena word life baseball shirt, a pair of cute jeans, his word life pendent and a pair of black and white shoes to match the shirt. I have no idea why I always try to look super cute when the WWE comes to the STL but I've been doing it for years so there is no use in breaking the tradition. LOL!!! When I was younger, I used to hope that the WWE would notice me and hire me. Maybe that thought still lingers inthe back of my mind and that's why I try to look so cute at the shows or maybe I'm trying to pick up a hottie at the WWE shows. Either way works for me. LOL! Oh oh... maybe I could get hit on by a WWE hottie and then get hired by the WWE.... hey a girl can dream can't she? 

Also speaking of the WWE, I have 81 days until WWE Summerslam. I won an all expensed paided trip to the PPV(or pay-per-view) in Toronto Canada. How cool is that? Anyways, I have an oppurtunity to meet some of the wrestlers. I would die if I got to meet my ""husband"" John Cena. I would also like to meet Rey Mysterio Jr, Matt Hardy, Shannon Moore, The Hurricane(a.k.a Shane Helms) and many many more. I just hope that they let us chose who we get to met. Of coarse there is the old saying, beggers can't be choosers. I'll except whoever they let us meet.  

I have mentioned John Cena many times throught this whole thing and I thought that maybe I should let you guys know who he is. John Cena is a professional wrstler of the WWE, who in turn I have a crush on. That is why I call him my ""husband."" This whole thing started when I had a dream about him in January of this year. The dream went a little like this: 

I am laying at the edge of a bed (kind of like you do when you watch TV) and he is sitting on the floor in front of the bed. My arm is on top of his head. We can see into the next room and there are a bunch of different wrestlers talking to each other. John did or said something and I told another person that we should smack him in the back of the head. He
turns the back of his head towards me. I take my arm off the top of his head and whisper in his ear ""I could never smack you in the back of the head."" He said, ""I love you Erica."" Before I could say anthing, I woke up.

The weird part about the whole dream was that for someone I didn't like, I seemed to love him (dreams are what your subconsis thinks.) After that, I began to have a crush on him and every day has been magical since. LOL.....

You know what? I feel much better after writing this. Like exercising, maybe I should make this a daily ritual as well. I get al the things that are bothering me or just running through my mind, off my mind and I don't sit up at night thinking about it. Very cool....

Later peeps,
Erica"

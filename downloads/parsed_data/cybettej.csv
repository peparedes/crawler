"event","humph... am hating my job at the moment... drudgery after drudgery.  

However, to rectify this... My NY resolution is to apply for 2 jobs every week, to get out of this stinking hell hole.  I need a change, I need new faces, I need new things to do, new work.  I can feel all the hate that is inside of me building up, when I enter this building.  I never feel like this, this isn't me... therefore, it IS TIME TO GET OUT!!!! And make this world my oyster... so I can make/be a pearl one day.

Goodness... how cheesy!  But meh - bite me."

"event","argh... is it all coming back to me?  The whole no self esteem, avoiding eating, throwing up if i feel i've ""gone over the limit"".  Not only that, but also some blackness is coming back... my moods are slightly swaying and i can snap from laughing to a psychotic hosebeast quicker than snapping ones fingers.

I am not going to let this come back and beat me.... I am going to over come these feelings.. you are not going to take away another 5 years of life to ravage my body, EVER AGAIN"

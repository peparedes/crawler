"event","wow. i can't believe i still even HAVE a livejournal. haha. so much has changed since i've made this. so much has changed. Everything has changed actually. 
For starters, I'm happy with my life. it's not 100% fabulous...but it's about 85% great! Better than it has been, ever. 
i'm doing online schooling to be a pharmacy tech. 
I am getting married in October to...the best man ever. The only man that's been there through thick and thin with me. Not to mention the only man who makes me feel beautiful and even sexy ;-)
I'm getting my life on track. Slowly but surely and it feels amazing to be going in the right direction without the doubts of my future lingering infront of me at all times. 
I have a few new people in my life. I'm about to take on the Buffons, and the Stephensons and become part of their craziness. 
I'm going to have a niece soon. I can't wait to see what she looks like. 
In the last 2 years. I've channeled my inner Samantha. I'm not easily influenced by others and i'm taking on my own responsibility. I'm still sorry, but not nearly as much as i was 5-6 years ago. I'm no where near the same person...and i can say...it's mostly a good thing.
so, that's about all. that's about all the update. i'm sure i could come up with more. but...no reason to right now."

"event","I never thought of myself as a hero. I would laugh at anyone who says i'm someone. let alone a someone which another person looks up to.
In my mind...i'm a frazzled, confused, misplaced and unaware girl.
But for a few moments i got to step into the mind of another girl. A girl not much different than myself. A girl, who calls me a hero.
Whose eyes light up at the site of me. Whose plans she would change in an instant to accommodate the silliness of my own.

As i stepped through her room...i saw my own...literally and figuratively, as she's kept some of my old things.
i saw her passions; the many that she has. I saw her works. The art...and the words she uses...they were the same as mine and still are to this day. Even her thoughts were the same...the feeling of the room was slightly familar. I realized her struggles are the same as mine were...and still are.
To her, i must have surpassed them all with ease. i must be that someone she wants to see in herself. She is me...my awkwardness, my longing, the desires...of a 12 year old me, 15 year old me, and of a 20 year old me. she is me.

although, she is that someone i want to see in myself. That little bit extra I hadn't acquired in growing up. The bravery and talent i'd always wanted. The thirst for knowledge and courage to give it all she's got. I keep asking how someone as well rounded and together as a twelve year old gets, looks up to someone like me. My actions, my thoughts, my soul..reflect onto her...They mean something to her. Everything i say counts to this girl. It's a weird feeling for me. To be looked up to as apposed to looked down upon.

From the minutes i spent in that room...i took away more than i had thought i could. I appreciate the fact that she see's me worthy of a hero...and she, in return is a hero to me."

"event","There are just some periods of time where...for one reason or another, I become too overwhelmed and too ""busy"" to do the things I love to do...
Like laughing, 
Or smiling
Listening to music
Writing..
When do I become too busy to forget who I am and what I love. Even who I love.
Laughing feels great. And suddenly, I remember that there was times in my life when I laughed constantly. I loved the way things went...I loved the challenges and craved to overcome them. When smiling...I am reminded that things can always be worse. Laughing erases the thought of dread and the unaccomplishable (is that even a word? lol). 
There are things I LOVE to do...But for some reason I make excuses as to why I shouldn't do them. I need to worry more, instead of turning on the music that once did and still does feed my soul. Instead of doing something I enjoy, like cooking...I microwave because it's quicker. I don't and haven't drawn/painted/doodled anything in ages...
All these things make me feel good, make me happy. But I've suddenly become to preoccupied to even think about anything as simple as laughing with someone I love. Or smiling at someone. Instead, I spend my time making excuses as to why I shouldn't do the things I love and being angry instead of happy. 
I turned on my music today while cooking...Two things I enjoy doing, very much. And it was automatic. Forgetting my day and focusing on that moment. What I was doing and how I was feeling was the only thing. Content. I thought nothing about the lady who was rude to me today. I thought nothing about the bills that await my long overdue payments. My heart felt like it was in the right place and the only thing that could have made it better was being around the people I love and sharing myself and what I love, with them.

I know this all sounds mushy, obvious, and stupid...but sometimes...I FORGET to be me. I get so wrapped up in who I think I should be. I forget to listen to the music and let it fill me up. I forget to take jokes as JOKES and not as criticism. I forget to take time for me and to do the things I love. I forget about me."

"event","i used to write. i used to write daily. words would just come from my fingertips like the ink from a pen. effortlessly...fluid...
it used to be my only lifeline...now it's more habitual than anything. it relaxes me and puts my frustrations and worries aside for a little bit. Thoughts never came out well in words for me.  My ""journals"" used to go everywhere with me...i remember the very first thing i wrote about. what started my writing craze....it's silly...the problems a girl has...the questions and drama. still...years later...not much has changed. my thoughts hardly seem worth saying..but when in a mood...writing them...is magical to me. connects me to so many things...like music. they're just part of my soul. Absolutely.
I used to write words...no matter the meaning...no purpose needed at all. has all that changed? are my writings unnecessary now? Do i even need them?...of course. i just put them away...stuff my thoughts in the back of my head...wondering when i'll have time for them. Are they even good enough to put down on paper...but what do i really care? in all reality...nobody will read these thoughts and writings...not the ones i don't want them to anyways...John might...but i trust him enough not to laugh at me...
i used to have a safe place. Where i could escape any time...on a hill,made of logs, next to the forest.....with a brook...and the smell of fresh air...
it has been a very long time since i've visited it...or thought about my bed. My beautiful white, soft, cool, cozy bed...with it's dark wooden posts...
so comfortable and comforting...
i haven't been focusing on the right things at all.peace of mind. myself...healing myself...and living...like i used to. connected...my thoughts and my pen. my body here...my mind and soul in those places"

"event","i don't know what the purpose of my writing right now is...but i feel it necessary...i can never spell that word. i use spell check every time.
I am getting ready to leave for California with my mom and sister in two days...
i am excited...but i'm nervous. i'm not sure why. i don't really want to leave home...but i know i'll feel better if i do....mentally...just to get away from the every day...ya know?
Nate's party he had...turned out horrible. his ""friends"" stole over $25,000 worth of jewelry and shit...I am so upset. Nathan feels like utter shit...and mom's so upset she can't even sleep in her own bed.  it's...horrible... and sad. 
i haven't packed for California...Half of me is super excited, i don't remember that much of California from the last time i went when i was like...10... But the other half, i don't know. the other half wants to stay at home and relax. i just...can't bring myself to pack.
I really miss John. I mean, he's here of course, but with our different schedules, he's sleeping when i'm awake and vise a versa.
I really am  not tolerating people today. I am just fed up! Maybe because i can see a light at the end of the tunnel...i'm just that anxious and can't wait to get things on the way back to ""normal"".
I've had a nagging from inside lately...i know ""they"" are waiting for me. Things have been coming to me a lot lately. I sound insane, don't i??! haha. but really...i feel the need to get intouch with my inner and higher self. I am in need of the help. I've asked for it...but now i'm truly ready for it, i believe. It's just finding the time and the way. i just haven't been able to ""connect""...ya know...it's rather annoying. I wish there was a way that i could figure this out. I wish there was a simple solution. 
I am going into a regression... of sorts...I have a need to move on...but i'm so stuck in this...comfort zone i've created for myself. I am way too afraid...of rejection...or maybe it's success that i'm afraid of. 
i don't know...i'm just...babbling.
I am extremely exhausted...and can't wait for my last day of 3 AM shift bright and early. 
John said he wants to go to a movie with me, i hope i can make it work. 
Mom wants me to have dinner with her and chuck tomorrow nite and stay the nite there...i really don't want to...but...if we leave at 6 AM..it'll be much easier if i stay there....
i don't know. i would love to sleep...i am exhausted...but i'm not...tired per say...who know's

I don't do this for you, i do this for me. that somehow, in retrospect, i may find myself in the pages i write, the music i love, going through the emotions i have.

i'm just pissed. the one time we get to have a semi-vacation together...he can't go. i really don't mean to be this negative, but i don't even want to plan going anywhere with him...he always ends up having to work through everything...except his cousin's wedding...which was stressfull and no where near a vacation...

the slightest bit of sainity...hypocritical bullshit liar.
i still don't know where i stand with different things..
school is starting soon. i am looking forward to it..but not. just another mundane thing to add to the list of mundane things i do every day. 
work isn't that great either. it's not bad, i can't complain but there is nothing new.
i'm still wanting to get away. but with work and school it will not be easy at all. it's not very probable. probably not possible either. although it's not on my mind as much as it was two weeks ago...it's still there and it's still a strong feeling. 
it's a rather hopeless feeling that i've been having lately. about everything. who am i? do i know this yet? i've gone over this same subject millions of times. i've written about it more times than i can count and i've thought about it more times than i chose to remember. but what am i to do about it. is it really as simple as i make it seem to everyone else? how i explain...just do something for yourself. be who you want. fuck what people think! is it really that easy..that simple? god i hope so because i am having trouble doing that. i'm a huge hypocrite. 
i am a confused, baffled, fickle, insane, hypocritical bullshit liar. it's easy for me to make mistakes. easy for me to say i'm sorry. but i don't like it. i don't like being sorry all the time...i can't help it. honest. i hate being a hypocrite...giving out good advice that i cannot or will not take for myself. 
i can't understand my opinions and/or feelings. my feelings are through the roof with people, situations, and this mess i call my life. my opinions are strong but weak if that makes sense. i feel strongly..about things..i have opinions...that are strong. but putting those in words or actually taking action upon those opinions and feelings will be or would be hard...if i ever do decide to share anything. i'm babbling now and this makes no sense. 
part of me wants the impossible. 
the other part...just wants the every day norm. 
but the impossible...is a fierce feeling inside of me...

my arms are aching for that familiar feeling. my heart is aching for the freedom of myself. my mind is aching for some peace...and i'm waiting for this mess i call my life to calm down and my understanding and reasoning to find me...somewhere...
where i don't feel so trapped inside my head..inside my constantly wondering crazy mind.
i must stop writing. thinking on this for too long makes me sick to my stomach.

"event","i was at my safe place. just me. i was on my big four poster bed, wrapped up in white linen. i got up, i walked down the stairs in my bare feet. i slowly opened the heavy wooden door. i smelt the earth, the fresh air, the sweet smell of spring flowers. i heard birds, and the slow sway of the trees. i felt the grass under my toes.
 then, comming towards me. . . I saw...myself. my ""full potenial self"". i was beautiful and upright. there was confidence and a sense of self beaming around my full potential self. 
 she came towards myself.&nbsp; wrapped her arms around me and this great comfort washed over my body. i was calm, confident, aware, and amazed. 
 ""your beautiful"" is what she said to me. and she kissed my forehead
 
 i woke from this comopletely unaware of what my physical body was doing. i was crying. but it felt so good."

(i'm a good advice giver...just not a good advice taker...lol, i'm retarded)i feel the love and all the other emotions throughout my daily activities...ya know. i'm not ""depressed"". whatever. i just...haven't gotten enough soul searching done. i want so vainly to be in those places.  outside of the gym at ral...with friends...talking...and pretending to miss the shuttle bus. laughing at her house for hours and talking about boys. riding the bus home with her...how we hated that bus. in mr. fogus' (sp?) class...the only class..where i felt i really came away with anything every single day. middle school, passing notes. the beach with the boys, having the best time ever. in his car with smiles on our faces. oh how i would love to be there in those places...the river at 10 o'clock at night, swimming with the neighbors. in that room, talking all night and painting his fingernails. at albertsons buying food and actually going back to that same class we left from. smoking in my car with those different people...the park in the rain, holding his hand, falling in love.<br />those are the moments that make up my life. those are the kind of moments... not huge and earth shattering. not life-altering. simple. beautiful...cherished<br /><br />and i feel slightly better.<br /><br />thanks<br /></font><br /></font>"

"event","soemthing so familiar...this little live journal of mine. something that myspace can't compete with. is it the memories i've written, the strong ones? was it the feedback from the people who were my friends? it's not like my friends now aren't my friends....or do i have friends at all? who knows?
But i'm fine with that. I have the one friend that matters. And i have my boys. we work, we get home, we sit together and bull shit. we sit together and smoke. And all at once our minds melt into eachothers. not because we are suddendly lazy and all think about food and drink at the same time (which we do)...but no one has to say anything. whatever you do...it's forgiven, or understood. we laugh carefree about the shit that happens to us. we stop caring what exactly is going on in the world. all that matters...are those hours we don't remember. all that matters...is that no one has to say antyhing. I watch them play games, we watch movies, we laugh...oh how we laugh. what better to bring people together.
And my mind wanders...and creativity courses through my vains. If only i weren't afraid to see the outcome...maybe something decent might come out of it. even when in the most relaxed state, i am afraid of my creativity. I know i could do good at some things...but i won't bring myself to do them. 
mom and i had a talk a while back...and we've discovered..i am afraid of success! what is success? it's the opposite of failing. it is the only thing i've ever been able to do. I could have gotten straight A's in school. if only i cared enough to pay attention. if only i had cared enough to turn in my work, if only i had put a little more effort in. but i didn't. what would i do if i were to succeed? what's after success!? that's my biggest problem? that is my biggest question. what nest, what after i did my best? there's no best i can do after my original best is there? does this make any sense? probably not. 
What i am saying is...i have so much more potental, that i can honestly feel in myself...but i'm too afraid to show it. too afraid of succeeding at somtehing i want...too afraid of failing."

what are these crazy dreams...what are these dreams i have been having? so vivid...sequental...so...unrealistic but unavoidable. it's crazy. last night's dream made sense...stayed up late playing a video game...and drempt about it. that's explainable. But what about the rest? none of those make sense. no rhyme or reason. the only thing similar in all those dreams is the fact that i end up having to wake up because i'm dreaming about peeing. better to wake myself up than to pee in bed i always say. haha. goodness i'm funny. not. 

anywho...there's some things i'm trying to figure out. my lack of feeling the other things in life. I don't think it's me at all. well, it is me...but not as much as i had origonally thought it was...in all reality i have come to the conclusion that it must be my house. my house...it's not as comfortable as my past ones. like kelso...but that was just open to EVERYTHING...and trust me, ANYTHING could find it's way there. it's like there's a bat signal going to that house...but once it was finally clear of all that shit...it was good and comfy. vancouver was a big change...and those apartments in silver oak...were decent for those...i found a few things there. but since we've moved to our new apartments...there has been nothing. i find things outside...in other people's houses...especailly in the car for a good reason. But...i have no other option other than to assume it's my house. My mind races there. it's not like i don't like my house. i love it. I just can't 'connect' there. i could anyother place ( i think so anyways ). wow i haven't written and babbled like this in a long time. 
if anyone knows what i'm talking about...i'm open to suggestion. i'd really like to be able to find a way to connect to these things. especially my guides...i feel this is a time in my life where as i could use them. . .

anywho...i went to enchanted village today for kylies birthday thing. It was actually quite fun. except for the haunted house. Okay, here's the story. In all my life, all that i can remember anyways...i have been in a haunted house...ONCE. those fake ones at fairs and such, you know.and today...i remembered WHY! chuck wanted to go through the haunted house...i was so freaked...i was sweating! i know nothing in their is ""haunted"" it's just a bunch of mechanincal figures talking weirdly and moving awkwardly...but STILL...it freaked me out. It's just the thought of things popping out in the darkness...well the darkness itself too, actually. it's just that i expect something to scare me...and waiting to be scared is the scariest part of all! anyways...the trip was fun, i really liked the crooked house and the log ride. i got soaked...i just finally dried off about two hours ago. i hate walking in wet jeans. it's the most uncomfortable feeling ever."

So i'll clean the kitchen, watch the price is right...lol, clean the livingroom, bathroom then my bedroom.

To be honest. I'm tired of being pregnant already. I hate having all the attention to me. Everyday someone is asking me how i am doing...but it's not like casual...it's obsessive. I can't do ANYTHING around here. I can't lift up a chair!1!! a chair for christ sake! I just want to be somewhat relativly normal. I'm not hadicapped. Maybe some people shoudl stop seeing me that way. It's just me, with a baby. I know i'm delicate and all that...but i'm not retarded. I know what i can and cannot do. I listen to my body. Trust me.

I, growing up...took care of myself a lot. not totally...but an aweful lot. I even took care of my brother, who is 2 years younger than myself. that is enough for one person. honestly. it is. taking care of yourself should be enough for one person. but supposidly...not me. 
when dad knocked up tonya...i babysat. I was promised i wouldn't become a ""built-in-babysitter"". and i wasn't...at first. i would get payed...and if i didn't want to watch them. i wouldn't have to. but eventually...the pay stopped and the babysitting became more and more frequent. I rarely had time for myself even though tonya rarely had jobs. finally, i got sick of it...and moved out. I didn't appreciate the fact taht i was being the ""mom"" i fed them, cleaned them, and took care of them. 
Once again, I was promised not to become a ""built-in-babysitter"" when i moved into my mother's house. it was fine for a while. but then...right as rain...i became just that. mom lost her job shortly after i started junior year in my new school, in my new city, in my ""new and better life"" Mom got accepted to go to ashmeed college...to study message therapy. then told me...she'd need someone to babysit...but i would get payed regularly. for some ungodly reason i believed that even though she had not job..that i'd get payed. and it wouldn't be that bad. stupid me. She coudln't even afford groceries. my boyfriend bought more groceries than she did. her boyfriend/lawyer/sugar daddy payed rent and bills numorous times. And the cash never got to me. once in a while..i'd get twenty, maybe forty dollars...like at dad's house. but that was because i'd babysit a whole weekend for her while she was at her boyfriends house. 
Well nothing's changed. she still has no job...although she's finally qualified for unemployment...and gets 300 a week...she still won't take a job. she's been offered numorous jobs before. i mean it too. she'll tell me about it. but she'll tell me she turned it down as well. i guess it wasn't good enough. it wasn't good because it didn't give her the 15 dollars an hour she was used to. 
FUCK THAT!
A job is a job bitch, no matter how much it pays. at least it pays. and when you have children to feed and house... you cannot depend on your boyfriend or on a hope and a prayer. it doesn't work like that.
so i, i try to be a good person...i tell her i'm going ot look for a job. i will pay for a babysitter and nothing else. but she won't ""allow me"". her words exactly. because supposidly she knows how important her schooling is and how important i am to her schooling. but she doens't care about me or anything. 
it's worse now. she goes out...all the time. even when her son, who she only sees once every other weekend comes around. rarely ever does she stay home...and when she does...she complains about everything. i mean it too. i'm not overexagerating. my little sisters dad works in cali a lot...and when mom can't find a set of grandparents she passess her onto me, knowing full and well that i will beacuse i feel guilty from the guilt trips taht she feeds me! 
last weekend was kinkfest...and she passed kylie onto her grandparents. i had to take her down to longview, take her to kinkfest and come back. then sunday rolls around...i have to go get kylie. suprise suprise. and her grandparents b itch at me for being late. FUCK THAT! if i have to play mom. i'll be late if i want to. then i have to take her back to vancouver...by that time mom calls and asks...can you and john just take care of her...because i don't feel like coming home. i'm tired..i'm exhausted. I've had enough of it. I'm sick of playing mom! that's the third time this month she wno't come home...and just lets me and john take care of HER FUCKING DAUGHTER!
all i want is the mother fucking guts to stand up to her and say fuck you! SHe's your damned daughter...not mine!
I shouldn't have to raise her
I shouldn't have to spend JOHN""S MONEY to feed her and take her where YOU want her to go but YOU wo n't because YOURE TOOO Lazy.
I shouldn't have to take care of her because you're busy getting your ass slapped by your boyfriend
And I should be able to have MY OWN life.
I should be able to get a fucking JOB if i FUCKING want to
I should be able to be SAMANTHA
NOT KYLIES MOM
because id idn't BIRTH HER
YOU DID MOM
SO FUCK YOU
YOU TAKE CARE OF HER
FUCK YOU!!!!FUCK YOU'

whew...i feel a tiny bit better"

"event","Yesterday I had kickline try-outs and our group did so good!!! 
I'm so happy...

I was really really nervous right before I went in I felt like I was ganna pee in my pants (dont worry i didnt) but then once I started I  was having so much fun!

Our group didnt get to try-out until about 6:00 because of our numbers I was 45 janie was 44 kellie was 46 and victoria was 47

I dont find out til monday if I made the team so I guess we'll have to wait nd see !

I know the dance so I'm really happy but I was really tired sweaty and hot.

Our group does pretty good with the dance we're trying so hard so hopefully all the hard work wil pay off!

"event","Yesterday I went to adventureland with my friends. I had a lot of fun! After that I went over my friends house and played manhunt with a bunch of other people but everyone started to argue and talk gossip and it was sooo annoying..so I stopped playing. The rest of the night everyone was just talking telling secrets and stuff ... me and caroline were like the only ones who were getting kinda annoyed.But w/e its all in the past and everyone left still as friends!

Kelsey and Ally you to pretending to fight was hilarious!



Right now im just really tired so that means I'll post later

"event","They were driving on a smooth road toward the cusp of freedom and divinity.  She tried to hold your hand after so many months of not seeing you.  You couldn't bear to look down and see the petite, caucasian hand with perfectly filed nails touching you and grazing your inner thigh.  So you looked away to her other hand, propped up against the cold window.  You noticed the ring still glimmering and shimmering.  Past, present, and future still blatant.  You quickly changed the subject to drugs and bad trips.  We've had them all, right?  Yeah, that's what I thought."

"event","So, it's 72 degrees out right now and it's 4:30 in the afternoon.  Third quarter ended on Friday, I hate school.  Spring Break starts on Friday.  I wish I was spending it with Andrea, but I have made prior commitments to see my family, and smoke weed with Kye, Amber, and Chel.  I'm flying up on Saturday morning.  The weather will go from 70 to 40.  I'll pull on my green birkenstocks and hippish sweaters and embrace the cold.  My pap went into the hospital on Friday night.  I was out with Ashley and didn't feel like answering my mom's phonecalls.  She said that Jason told her that Bobby is gay.  Elder Mangum left.  So much has happened in 3 weeks.  My life has flip flopped.  I came inside out from a night of doing nothing.  My mom told me flat out what happened.  And I longed even more to fly up north.  I love the north.  It makes my nose cold.  I miss the bright green hills and snow covered sidewalks.  I told Ashley some more information about the night I hardly told her anything about.  A pinky swear held high in the air.  Tomorrow will be weird.  A new Latin teacher.  I think he's from Country Day.  Tomorrow is a new start, just remember that.  Bye."

"event","I picked you out 
Of a crowd and talked to you 
Said I liked your shoes
You said thanks can I follow you? 
So it's up the stairs 
And out of view
No prying eyes 
I poured some wine 
I asked your name you asked the time
Now it's two o'clock, 
the club is closed we're up the block
Your hands on me 
Pressing hard against your jeans
Your tongue in my mouth 
Trying to keep the words from coming out
You didn't care to know 
Who else may have been you before
I want a lover I don't have to love 
I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck
Where's the kid with the chemicals? 
I thought he said to meet me here but I'm not sure
I got the money if you got the time 
You said it feels good I said I'll give it a try
Then my mind went dark 
We both forgot where your car was parked 
Let's just take the train
I'll meet up with the band in the morning
Bad actors with bad habits 
Some sad singers 
They just play tragic
And the phone's ringing 
And the van's leaving 
Let's just keep touching
Let's just keep keep singing
I want a lover I don't have to love
I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk
Where's the kid with the chemicals
I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full
I need some meaning I can memorize
The kind I have always seems to slip my mind
But you but you 
You write such pretty words
But life's no story book 
Love is an excuse to get hurt 
And to hurt 
""Do you like to hurt?"" 
""I do! I do!""
""Then hurt me."""

"event","I hate drama.  Andrea left at 2 a.m. this morning for Colorado and I hope to God that Jackson sticks by her so that she will come home.  Yesterday Andrea and Jackson pulled up to my house to say good bye and return my sunglasses.  I said good bye and I didn't cry.  I did my homework and ate dinner with my mom.  I was getting really tired because I've been sleep deprived this whole week.  I asked my mom if she would help me put the new sheets on my bed and she said yes.  I was finishing them up and she was outside talking to John.  She was drunk off her ass and she came into my room and knocked a cup of coffee off my computer desk..then proceeded to blame it on me.  We beat each other up.  I was sobbing hysterically so I called Andrea.  Her and Jackson came to pick me up.   She came through my sliding glass door.  I was a mess.  I had all my stuff packed and we got in the car.  We drove to the gas station on our way to her old apartment.  Jackson told me to smile.  I caught a glimpse of his pubes as he was pulling up his jeans.  Andrea bought me a coke and a candy bar.  I sobbed all the way up to her apartment by UNC-Charlotte.  When we got there she started burning cd's and we watched television.  I kept looking at her and Jackson and how much they love each other.  I'm glad it's that way because Andrea knows she has someone waiting for her when she comes home.  On our way to the apartment, Andrea called Bobby who has taken care of me before..we're tight.  He's really sick and he didn't want me to get it so he kept calling Ashley.  Ashley finially answered and I was going to stay at her house that night.  After Andrea burned all her music we got in the car.  I felt like Jackson was mad but he was just so sad to lose her.  He got his stuff out of her car and they walked up the steps to the apartment he shares with his father.  They were in there for awhile.  I kept trying to find some good cd's to listen to.  The only thing I found was dance music which wasn't a good choice at this time.  Andrea came down the steps finally and started crying.  She won't see Jackson for a few months.  Never in my life have I seen her cry like that.  She stopped her car right in the middle of the road to sob.  I started crying too.  Not just because of Jackson but because Andrea and I are so close and this situation is very sad.  We drove and listened to some good music..turns out she had her cd's in her purse.  When we were five minutes from the meeting place with Ashley, I called her.  Andrea and I waited a few moments.  Those few moments I will always remember.  I tried not to cry but the pain was hard to deal with.  She realized she still had her bowl in the car.  Her mom would be taking the car for a while so I took the bowl.  I gave her a hard squeeze and tried not to look back as I went into Ashley's car.  John tried to get me arrested tonight and I wish Andrea was here to help me through it.  This is so sad I can't deal with it.  While she is gone I am going to do well in school and get in shape.  I'm trying to give myself something to do while she's gone to make myself numb to the pain."

I sometimes put too many is's in my sentences but everyone thinks it's funny.  In bio med tech our seats got changed.  Once again Jazzy sits way far from me, but I am by Kun.  He's got this really expensive puffer jacket and I wore it in class today...I felt like a pimp..hell ya!  We talked about the C word..cancer that is.  I know so much about it, I answered all the teacher's questions.  I tried to block it out when it happened to me but I couldn't. If he was going to die I wanted to know why.

You looked this one in her eyes, a dark arousing gaze.  The brown to the green.  Hot flesh to hot flesh.  Sweat escaping pores.  Eyes wide with desired, the coveted in your hands alas.  The sweet moment of intimate contact came and you were delighted.  Delighted to feel this..so warm and tight.  Delighted to love her just one last time.  Delighted to look into the green and see the blurbs of love and emotion she still had for you.  You push harder and deeper into her body and her soul.  You remember the first stages of innocent love.  You remember when she made the first move to kiss you.  The innocence dwindled into rock hard passion.  She'd let you travel deep inside every inch of her personal life.  She cared about you--she tried to watch out for you.  When she had to leave you got deep inside her one last time.  The thick cushion of raptured feelings diminished into this.  She still wanted you despite the pain.  You'd have none of that, since the tables were turned.  Drugs and irresponsibility shaded her eyes.  You still loved every inch of her.  You still thought she was beautiful, even though this love could not work again.  Your passion for her took you both to a new level of pleasure and allure.  At first response it felt like a mistake, but all along you just realized she was in love with you once again and you couldn't put yourself through the agony of human thought.  The love bleeds through your skin.  You can still taste her and feel her excitement.  And she wants you too, more true to heart than ever.  You know it's beautiful.  You realize you'd be happy with her--to be with her--but you can't bring yourself to it.  It would be excruciating to look into the green and see those raptured feelings.  It would be agony to taste her excitement and get inside her again.  It would be agony to realize what you were without all this time."

Well...yeah.  So, Ash swears up and down he still loves me.  It's hard to take that in.  I hope it's true because it would mean a lot to me.  It's not that I am so lovestruck by him, it's just the bond we have..covalent I tell ya.  Yeah, I had to break out the science terms.  Ash says it'll always be that way with him because of everything we were and all we went through.  I can still remember the first time we met.  It was on my birthday almost two years ago to the day.  This will be the first year he won't be there to help me blow out the candles.  Yeah, it's depressing to me, but I keep thinking about our last night together.  It was wonderful and a little (I mean, extremely) hot.  Whatever the case, I wish you could see my scar tissue.  You aren't here to see the green colored glass in my eyes.  You aren't here for all the things you used to be.  All the things I wanted you to see.  I never thought it would happen, but it did.  Do I regret being with you for a year and a half?  Fuck no.  Hell no.  Absolutely not.  It was great.  We were more than platonic pals...wayyy more.  I'll always remember our little secret moments and the times you got pissed at me were really hot.  Sometimes I wanted to pounce on you right then and there...even in your car.  I look at my hand everyday and see all the beauty we ever shared.  Nothing can break it.  I'm sorry I broke your heart.  I hope she's more beautiful in every way.  I promise I won't be selfish.  I just want you to hold my hand again and listen to music me while we lay together..just you and I (and maybe the fan because it can get really hot in your room)."

Is it possible for people to get tired of having sex?  Really can someone answer me this?  Is it possible to give up such an action?  Does your drive for it just run out like water to a faucet?  Is this really possible?  Answer me that.  I remember us rocking out in your car and I felt like you loved me again.

I can't wait for this summer, although I can't get back what we had.  It was beautiful.  I'll love you no matter where you are.

Right now I have this flip-flop feeling in my chest.  My heart beats up really fast and I can feel it pumping life inside my chest.  It's horrible and gross to say the least.  I wonder how Billy is.  My first love got in a car wreck in Flordia on Winter Break.  I still love him, that's for sure.  He's moved on, he has a girlfriend.  I am not going to be selfish.  I hope everything is going good for him.  Just because things in my life are hectic doesn't mean I have to wish ill on others.  He's so close to my heart.  I'd choose him over any South Meck guy any day.  We have a history...a good one.  Monday morning at 1 am he called me.  I didn't hear it, it was a school night.

"event","Tonight I will be celebrating with Ashley as we bring in 2005 with a bang.  This year had been an amazing year.  It seems like the years just keep getting better.  2004 was difficult in the beginning because I just started South but I quickly grew to like it.  I wore short skirts and the sun was always in my face.  I wouldn't do my homework, I'd just listen to music and be free.  I hope 2005 is better as I party and grow older.  Last night I did a shit load of homework because I know I won't be doing anything related to school this weekend.  

So I think of what I was doing on New Year's Eve last year.  I was depressed because I had to move but I was also excited to take a new direction in my life.  I was laying next to the only guy I ever loved.  It was depressing yet exhilerating.  We didn't drink or anything.  I convinced myself that we'd pull through this and everything would be okay.  It didn't happen that way and I let myself go through a few months of pain.  I lied to myself.  I told myself everything would be okay and I'd be back up north with nothing changed.  When I came up in June I found that many things were changed.  I missed the events of my community and that of friends and family.  As the visits became few and far between I saw how I was drifting away from the loved and adored.  I miss my pap more than anyone that lives in Pennsylvania.  I don't call him as often as I should, but the feeling is still there.  We love each other unconditionally.  He's always the first person I run to when I get there and the one I shed tears for as the plane is climbing to 3,000 feet.  If I go to Germany on Spring Break I will find a guy to join the mile high club with.  It's always been this little goal of mine.  The plane to Germany will be big, probably an Airbus A330 so the sound won't be so easy to hear.  I'm sure my mom and John will be getting dirty in first class..those suck ups.  Haha..I'll have several hours to screw around with some guy..if he was from South Meck I wouldn't be surprised because everyone there is a slut/man whore.  Whatever.

The sand was as white as cocaine with the texture of baby powder.  She dug her toes into it, not caring whether it ravished her immaculate pedicure.  She took off her headphones and ran into the surf, getting wet and smiling like it was going out of style.  A gun from the castle on the sand aimed right for her chest and the sinister man pulled the trigger.  Mission accomplished.  She fell into the water, waves crashing around her lifeless body.  A pool of red coagulated blood flowed from her wound as she washed further and further out to sea.  The water washed away the evidence.  It washed away all the guilt and pain.  The only people that knew about the strange occurence were the sinister man and the woman he killed.  Her music kept playing as though life would go on and this would be the town's best kept secret, nestled in two hearts.  Or were there other witnesses to the crime that had yet to come forward?  Her body grew only luke warm mingling with sea life and crashing waves.  Rigor mortise set it and this was no longer the body of a beautiful model, this was a contorted piece of flesh."

"event","So there's just a little more than half left of this school year.  I don't think I can take anymore of it.  I am going to have to tolerate this shit though.  So I had this wacky dream one of these nights.  I was dressed rather sexy with this short skirt and green shirt and really high heels.  I walked into this dark room and saw him and he said ""I'm sorry.""  I asked him what he was sorry for and he replied with one of those vague answers.  Some music came on, too blurry for me to undersand what it was and we danced.  When I mean dance I really mean dance.  He knew every move and by the end both of us were really sweaty living off a rush of adrenaline.  He just grabbed me and gave me this almost suffocating embrace.  Funny.  Quite funny.  Then we got in his car and drove down a road in the black midnight with the top down listening to Saw Red.  I took the bobby pins out of my hair,screaming the song as he accelerated around a curve.  I went into his glove compartment and found a bowl.  I got it ready to smoke from the weed in my clutch purse and I lit it.  He asked me what I was doing and at that moment I felt out of control.  I'm glad we got to his apartment shortly after that because I was ready to unleash the kinetic energy.  I took off my shoes as he came around to get the door.  He opened it up and I jumped out like a spring in action.  I jumped up the steps and at his door I waited for him to unlock the keys to freedom and warmth.  I couldn't help but think about how similar we were.  The music.  Phish and The Doors.  The Style.  Birkenstocks, ripped jeans, and vintage wear.  My nose and throat burned from breathing dry air so hard and fast.  This was natural.  This was instinct and I was entraped in the confusion of wanting this yet wanting more..too afraid to stop."

I'd want to dive inside and swim a few laps taking breaks to sip an alcoholic beverage or warm lemonade from Bojangles.  I saw Lynn at the mall today and our connection was that of very good friends.  Usually I am about a milimeter taller than her but she surpassed me today with her black pumps.  I miss her so much and I am afraid she is going to leave South in February, but I just want things to be better for her.  I was in Hot Topic looking for a Rolling Rock shirt but as I learned from the hot sales guy they aren't allowed to carry any alcoholic names.  So, tonight I looked online and found one that I like.  It's navy blue with the logo on the front and the motto on the back..hell ya!  And it's under $20.  Last night I became known as the Febreze Fairy.  I got really drunk at my house with her friend Leeann and John.  I started spraying the stuff everywhere I hear and so John calls me that.  I sprayed it at the dogs and in Leeann's eyes.  And oh I did pay for it this morning.  At 12 am Lynn called me and I felt like I was going to be sick.  I didn't fall asleep for a while and then I woke up really early because I was afraid I'd puke.  It's a fear of mine.  On the way to take my mom to work we stopped at Starbucs and I got a chai latte which calmed my stomach.  Then Leeann and I went shopping to South Park and picked my mom up $400 later.  I had full intentions of saving a portion of my Christmas money..a generous portion.  And it didn't fuckin happen!!  
the best song ever...
in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town

He went down South and crossed the border
Left the chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder

One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shiny skin

Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about to begin

 Wake up!
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?
The snake was pale gold
Glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisons

Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look!
I can't live thru each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down
The cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain . . .

Once I had, a little game
I liked to crawl back into my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called 'go insane'
Now you should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world forget the people
And we'll erect a different steeple
This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes no way to lose
And I'm right there I'm going too
Release control we're breaking thru

Way back deep into the brain
Back where there's never any pain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of
Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils, caves, cool air heights

Each house repeats a mold
Windows rolled
Beast car locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant
Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters, smug
With semen eyes in their nipples

Wait
There's been a slaughter here

(Don't stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
We're getting out of town
We're going on the run
And you're the one I want to come

Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do, but
Run, run, run
Let's run
House upon the hill
Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me
Let's run
 Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside
Dead president's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
C'mon along, we're not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar

Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl! We're almost home
Sun, sun, sun
Burn, burn, burn
Soon, soon, soon
Moon, moon, moon
I will get you
Soon!, Soon!, Soon!

Let the carnival bells ring
Let the serpent sing
Let everything

We came down
The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls
 
We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade

I am the Lizard King
I can do anything
I can make the earth stop in its tracks
I made the blue cars go away

 For seven years I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games
With the girls of the island
Now I have come again
To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
O Children of Night
Who among you will run with the hunt?
Now Night arrives with her purple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth
I want to be ready"

"event","Today started out rainy and I felt depressed.  In the morning, Lynn went with her friend to the trailors and after I came back from my locker Chris was waiting outside B building.  I was about ready to lose it and he asked where Lynn went.  Lynn sometimes disappears on him, but I told him where she went.  The bell rang, it was a long annoying beep, not even a real school bell.  The dreaded sound of the day.  Chris gave me his soup and told me to enjoy it.  I walked to gym that morning holding a cup of lukewarm soup in a cup.  I took one drink of it.  It tasted good but I was getting teary and I didn't feel up to eating.  A few hours later in math, Lynn tells me in her response to my note that her brother is coming up on Monday.   I have always wanted to meet her brother, he looks really sexy in the pictures.  She wants me to come over and meet him, hell ya!  She wants to read my journal, which I might end up letting her do when it is finished.  I need to smoke some more to help with the creative juices to pump out a few more really good poems for the end.  There are only like 6 more sheets of paper left.  My mom really doesn't care that I smoke.  I convinced her and John to get another puppy so Abby has a playmate.  We're looking tomorrow.  


Down the street you can hear her scream ""you're a disgrace""
As she slams the door in his drunken face,
And now he stands outside and all the neighbours start to gossip and drool.

He cries ""Oh girl, you must be mad,
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?""
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
And his tears fall and burn the garden green.

And so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually.

A little Indian brave who before he was ten, played war games in
the woods with his Indian friends, and he built a dream that when he
grew up, he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief.

Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow
He would sing his first war song,
And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,
Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so castles made of sand, melts into the sea eventually.

There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,
Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die.
She drove her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled

""You won't hurt me no more.""
But then a sight she'd never seen made her JUMP AND SAY
""Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way""
And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going.
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea,
Eventually"

"event","There was a fire at school on Tuesday.  It happened in F Building when a dipshit lit a bookcase on fire.  I was on the otherside of campus and walked toward the soccer field with a bunch of preps from my English class.  We were all huddled together trying to stay warm in the cold rain.  There was a hot group of guys next to us, lighting up their ciggies.  One of the was Wyatt with his green coat and mussed hair.  His secret for that perfectly fucked up hair in a recipe I'd never follow unless I was in the shower with him.  He says to wash your hair with a bar of soap to make it really dry and squeaky clean and let it air dry...and don't wash it everyday.  A really snobby bitch asked the rest of us in the group to push her into Wyatt.  I would not.  I looked into his big brown eyes and quickly looked away, this repeated for what seemed like an hour we stood out there.  I nervously looked at my perfectly filed and painted fingernails.  I was nervous that Blake was going to tell Wyatt about the things that happened with Ian.  Wyatt knows I'm not an angel but Blake is an asshole and he'll do anything to get me pissed.  I've been seeing W a lot lately which is almost discomforting.  I remember being so exicted to get to high school, especially South, now that I am here it fuckin sucks.  My Freshman year was great.  I was taking really cool classes and I was friends with all the Seniors and stoners.  I got good grades and did basically nothing to earn them.  I helped Wyatt and Jeremy cheat on more than one occasion.  I wrote a lot of crucial stuff in Creative Writing.  I played with the sex dice on the senior patio.  Being with Ashley was really incredible, along with having Brittain give me her lovely cold from my juice bottle.  It was great to be around great people.  I hated it then but I love it now.  This year seems horrible so I live in the past thinking of the days that are gone and set in stone.  


Waste/Phish Lyrics

WASTE
Don't want to be an actor pretending on the stage
Don't want to be a writer with my thoughts out on the page
Don't want to be a painter 'cause everyone comes to look
Don't want to be anything where my life's an open book 

A dream it's true
But I'd see it through
If I could be
Wasting my time with you

Don't want to be a farmer working in the sun
Don't want to be an outlaw always on the run 
Don't want to be a climber reaching for the top 
Don't want to be anything where I don't know when to stop 

A dream it's true
But I'd see it through
If I could be
Wasting my time with you

So if I'm inside your head
Don't believe what you might have read
You'll see what I might have said
To hear it

Come waste your time with me
Come waste your time with me

So if I'm inside your head
Don't believe what you might have read
You'll see what I might have said
To hear it

Come waste your time with me
Come waste your time with me
Come waste your time with me
Come waste your time with me

Come waste your time with me"

"event","Friday should've been a good day.  It was a B day and I had a really good lunch with Brittine and Alex.  My mom was supposed to come home and we were going to go raid the luxury mall--South Park.  Ya, it's the place were there's a Coach Store and you can buy the real Louis Vuttion bag.  My mom never came home until almost 8, we had wings that night from the place at Carmel Commons and I felt hopeless.  My mom wasn't spending anytime with me, she was with John and they were having a jolly good time without me.  I stayed in my room crying making a thick load of snot.  I laid on my bed and closed my eyes and I thought of dying.  In this hot dream I imagined picking up a pistol and putting it to my temple and pulling the trigger and not feeling a damn thing.  My whole life would flash before me and it would be over.  From Heaven I'd look down and hopefully see people morning my loss.  I'd want my body to be flown up to Pennsylvania, since I know my family would never come down to Charlotte for any reason.  Who would come to my funeral?  I suppose the people that cared about me would come.  But, last year a girl at my school committed suicide and just about anyone who felt like getting dressed up went to her funeral.  If I could just die and see the people that actually care about me, I could shave off a few heartbreaks.  Then, I began to wonder how it would be at school.  Sure I go to a rather large school, but not everyone knows me.  Would people react like, ""Oh my God, I had no idea"" or would they act like, ""This was only a matter of time""?  Then I asked myself a lot of questions, mainly how life would fit after I was dead and gone and 8 spots were empty at school but they had my name on them.  How would everyone in English feel?  There'd be no one that wrote in bright orange and blue and pink.  The girl that would be happy writing the essay was gone.  What about in Latin?  Who would Krista and Elijah work with and who would be there to give Kun kooky looks across the room?  Who would give Vick crackers and pieces of Orbit gum?  Who would buy Britt's lunch and help Alex with Chem homework?  Who would sit opposite of Amanda and give dirty looks to Mrs.Hammond?Would Savannah be happy that I wouldn't be there to say hey across the big cafeteria?  I'd miss being able to drive to school and eventually go onto a good college.  Right now my heart is set on Appalachian but that may change.  I'd miss being able to write for large audiences and show my love for literature.  I'd miss so many things but it seems like a good thing to do.  What would the people from back home think?  Would Bill have a smile on his face knowing that I'd never be there to call him up at 9 am and beg him to come see me?    I'd be happy to give this a try, but my life is in shambles.  I am tired, drained, hopeless, and depressed.  I don't want to find out what could become of me and what my potential could bring to me.  I want to find out what it's like to live in Hell."

"event","It was the end to a sultry summer.  A summer where I had to be carried to the car or the bed or the bathroom more times than I can remember.  I can recall the first time I kissed you.  I had enough vodka and Saki to almost make me comatose.  I kissed you and it led to more in the July dampness.  You evoked this creature in me where I didn't care about anything but indulgence.  The only thing I cared about was listening to the guitar and your medicated metaphors.  You made me want to obliterate myself with all the weed and booze I could put my hands on.  You'd never make me smoke the resin from your vintage smoking apparatus..only the fresh stuff that I didn't pay for.  This started when you carried me up your stairs.  It seemed like a staircase, but as I revisited it was only 3 steps.  It ended with a sweaty hug full of empty promises.  It ended with you."

I went to English for first block and totally got mesmerized by what we had to do.  We had to write a response to the reading of ""The Stranger.""  I knew it was something I'd be good at and since I slaved over the reading and comprehension of the chapters, it was a breeze.  I got in a group with Jamison and Katherine and we were supposed to read this story, but whatever..we didn't.  I talked to the teacher about what book I should read for our outside reading project.  She suggested Anna Karenna..a 900 page novel.  I might buy it tomorrow and start reading so I can have it done for January.  After English, I walked across the cold campus to Latin over in J building.  It was difficult because I haven't opened up that book since before Thanksgiving.  The teacher is cool, but I am lost in her class.  I studied the Latin endings and all that shit for the test we took a few weeks ago and BAM! I got a....53.  I could tell it was bad when she put it face down on my desk.  Whatever...I tried.  I think Jordan should help me out with this crap.  So, then I talked to Krista and got something to eat in A lunch and then went to Bio Med Tech.  I did great on the test...99%.  I had lunch with Brittany and Alex and Nicole on the chilly Senior Patio.  I drank 3 bottles of Lemonade and had chicken and fries.  In foods class, I took out my pill of vic and swallowed it with some juice.  I started getting all hot and I could hardly stand, but I got my work done..high or not.  When I got home I fell asleep with Abby and that was that.  Lovely...later.."

"event","I was staring into space today as I waited in line at lunch.  I saw someone through the window pane with dark brown mussed hair and I thought it might be Wyatt..I hadn't seen him in forever in that lunch.  He turned around and walked toward the cashier, talking to her and making her laugh.  Those rosy cheeks of his must've helped him get away even though he was short on cash.  He was standing by the table with all condiments when I heard him start to talk to me.  My cheeks began to redden so I looked away.  Move over Jude Law..Wyatt should be the sexiest guy alive.  He kept saying ""hey Brittany"" but I wasn't sure if I heard him right so I looked at the floor becoming emersed in all the body heat from being packed in line.  I am going to go write a paper...later."

"event","I'm sitting here listening to The Doors exicted to leave and go back home.  Pennsylvania is my real home but I hate living out of a suitcase; I hate my mom not being here with me.  I miss my dog and the sunny crisp weather that greets me every morning.  But after August 2007 I'm done with this southern shit.  I want to go somewhere else for college.  I hate to think about where I am going to go after South Meck.  Shit, I could leave South Meck in February for good and never have to come back.  That's when I turn 16 and I can legally drop out, but I don't think that is the best thing for me.  I want to start applying myself and publishing my poetry and essays, but getting up the nerve to do it will take me a while.  An old friend always told me to just dive into things and take risks.  Sure, I can take a risk...like flashing some truckers and Hondas on I-77, but when it comes to overall success I can't.  I can't seem to be able to take that plunge into something good.  While staying here I thought a lot about relationships.  Probably a little too much.  I wanted to chill with Danielle but we both were sick and I was a little busy.  When I come back in the summer with my car and license things will be different.  I can't even comprehend myself driving and going as I please.  Hell, I'll probably live in my car and smoke entirely too much reefer.  I'll be able to pick up my friends and fib to my mom about where I am going--not that she really cares anyway.  I think things would be different with my mom if she pushed me or if she cared.  I need someone to push me and help me realize things.  No, we can't all be brilliant all the time.  I just want to use an ounce of my brilliance to better myself and get a better gpa.  In a way I think I am very successful.  I am writing some really innovative and deep poetry...my journal is almost filled.  I am so proud of my journal.  Krista wanted to read it while we were in the library last Monday but I couldn't seem to let go, she understood.  Even though there is nothing bad written in there about her and I trust her completely, I can't seem to let go.  I write in that thing always and it's so deep and private.  I let her see a few poems and things I wrote about my latest excursions.  Then we wrote poems about each other which was damn cool.  I told her about Tim and all that shit going on as the bell rang for third block.  She's fuckin cool as hell...not a replacement to anyone, just an enhancement to my life.  I want to know what happened.  I want to know what happened to my desire to learn.  A bad thought just came into my head.  At the beginning of the new semester I have to have read a book and done a project on it.  So, when I get home I need to take a look at the list and pick a book, read it inside and out, then make a visual for the 5 symbols.  Oh shit, and I have a yummy paper to write and someone has to  proof it.  Haha proof.  I need some hard liquor right now!!  Haha, a minor intoxicated on the plane.  It's funny...on my flight from Dulles to Pittsburgh last Tuesday they had hot towels and all that shit.  Since I am going to Dulles first this time, I hope they have hot towels again because I didn't take one last time.  Hell, I should be taking everything they give out because I paid for my ticket.  Thinking about going to San Fran...later!"

His party will be just days after I leave here.  I will make sure he knows that I really want to be there, but I can't...unless he wants to buy me a plane ticket.  I am going to see a movie on the Titanic exploration today at the Omnimax.  We'll see how that is.  For now I am going to go get in the shower..later."

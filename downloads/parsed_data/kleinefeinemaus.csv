aujourd'hui..wow havent used that word in awhile and cannot spell it..ACTs were terrible. hung out with Nick the rest of the day and then we went to Brian's. ultimate frisbee rocks my socks. except now theres a chunk of flesh missing from my foot. but thats ok.

last night nick came over

this morning i woke up exactly 1 minute before i had to leave for track and still got dressed and out to make it in plenty of time for practice..well not plenty. then we had an actual workout..which never happens on saturday, but im sure lac will make it a habit now.

then i showered and picked up norma (still hadnt eaten all day) and we got lost going to the mall.

got my wonderful prom dress and some pants

then off to hannahs party where we laid (?) out on the trampoline while it was lightning. 

and my brother and i have been calling each other back and forth today trying to get a minute to talk but that hasnt worked out...he better not be doing anything tomorrow.

and now i lose an hour of sleep for day light savings...sunday school tomorrow- havent been in about a month, i have so much stuff to update and be updated on there. 

a ton of homework tomorrow...but luckily PSSAs are going to make for a decently relaxing 4 day week.

im hoping to be sleeping over in gettysburg on thursday...but we'll see...

nick got his license!! yay!!

ugh my brain cant handle all the stuff i have to organize for school and getting a job and such...i know im going to forget something

so track was easy again...but tomorrow is super fast. i told myself in i guess january or so that i'd be at 95 for 400s by march....and tomorrows the last day of march. last week i was 1:45/1:40...so it'll be a jump..but i really want it.  and im already dreading the race next wednesday..8 laps around at race pace sucks. so very much...ewwww.

so saturday and monday theres a this like informal interview ""fair"" at this new grocery store i want to work at. i hope that works out and that they pay well. though...being a grocery store i doubt it. even if it is one of those ones that charges a whole lot more for organic-y food. i dunno.

"event","far too much driving is all i can say.

saturday we left, sans mon frere who i soon missed terriblely much because vacationing with the parents can get super frustrating without someone decently normal to hang out with, and we drove down to virginia. stayed in williamsburg 3ish days..i absolutely love it, it was so warm and pretty. monday morning we went to get a tour of william and mary and i love it so much...i really want to go there. maybe i felt more comfortable there because i'd already been walking and running through it the past 2 days....but anyways it feels so nice and perfect. 

next was more driving and then UVA. saw steve for about 40 minutes inbetween classes...we walked around a bit he showed me some stuff and it was good. left and drove somemore to lexington. 
this morning we saw wash lee...it so small, like 1700, barely bigger than high school. but it is nice i guess. just compared to w and m its not awesome. 

and then we went to JMU. initially i reallly liked it but as the tour went on, i realized just how huge the campus is and how theres nothing like the comfortable-know-everyone kind of feeling like and w and m or wash lee. its ok though...i suppose UD or PSU is the same thing for $10,000 less. so i dunno

so the conclusion is syracuse and w and m are my top to choices and i am very happy with both of them. this makes me feel slightly more stable than i have earlier on..knowing that there are colleges i feel at home at. 

the rest of the week i am running, shopping, catching up with people. oh and a ton of homework. hopefully i'll space that out so it wont be too bad. the main objective for the next couple days is to stay away from my parents...we've had enough bonding to last a long time.

alright...well if anyone feels like doing something call me."

so on to brighter and lighter things....last night was the seussical. they did a good job-i wish i could sing- but it was soo boring. i hate things without a definite plot. 

then this morning was track..my legs hurt so much. only 7 ppl came and we were all in different groups so everyone was either going too fast or too slow. lac came because theres a creepy stalker guy who just comes and runs with us. last week he asked some of the boys to get in his car...its really weird. julie and i freaked out when we saw a man running our way, luckily not the creepy man though.

so plans for spring break= college visiting. JMU, Washington and lee, and William and Mary. I'm slightly excited...in a nervous kind of way. I dunno. 

schools good..physics test was awesome and im pretty sure I did well on history. term paper...im already scared. anyone have any feedback on how to reform the grading system?

and then theres grades...why oh why didnt i take the A's when i could get them in 9th and 10th grade. i mean..maybe i can get 1/2 A's and 1/2 B's this year...and maybe mostly A's next year...but whats that going to help. then again...why do i care so much? i can get into 'cuse or clemson or furman with mostly B's. Stupid competition...which doesnt even push me far enough to work really hard..just makes me feel dumb. still, doing better than my brother did..so i can always go to g-burg if need be. 

speaking of which he took his marine physical test..and did pretty well. my parents think hes doing this just because of some romanticized/heroic feeling...which is how he was when he was like 12..but hes 20, and knows what hes doing and why. .

yesterday i decided to go to the hospital to see my grandmother. i just got a weird feeling that i shouldnt wait any longer to go see her. my grandpa died the sunday after i went to see him. that was 8-9 years ago. i remember he was eating apple sauce and seinfeld was on tv. only i didnt like seinfeld then bc i didnt get any of the jokes..silly 8 year old me. anyways..so while trying to get to the hospital i turned the wrong way into a one way street. i swear there werent any signs or anything...and there was a turn off lane. anyways so i go down it and realize that at the intersection the traffic light is only facing the other way, and the cars across it are sitting there waiting for me to turn around. right, so i get to the hospital and finally find the room and shes sleeping. so skinny its sick. so i sat for like 15 minutes deciding whether it was scare her if i tried to wake her up. i really wanted to ask her if she remembered woodrow wilson being elected (thats what we're learning in history) but..stupid me didnt wake her up..and im sure thats prolly the last time i had. well im not sure..but its quite possible. 
i try not to think about dying and stuff too much. im not really scared of it..just like for me..i know right now obviously i'll have missed out on loads of stuff. but my grandmother is 93...and i was thinking how much stuff shes lived through. i mean ww1, womens suffrage, the depression, ww2, vietnam, damn i dont even know half the stuff. and i never bothered to ask her bc...well 1 i was never really close to her..more to my grandpa..and 2 its hard for her to speak..even tho she knows everything and remembers everything. so why didnt i bother? eh i think i can go again today..so i'll ask her then..if she can talk at all. so weird though.

nick and i tried to get ppl to go to dinner on friday...but people are lame and already had plans or didnt want to just go to dinner. wtf..so youd rather sit at home? and we decided ppl need to be more social...i mean theres like 2 nights out of the rest of the week where we're not stuck in school...you'd think ppl would want to get out more. anyways.

i found the prettiest prom dress ever..if anyone wants to give me $260 thatd be helpful. ..yes i know its like 3 months away..thats besides the point.

"event","things are still good. i didnt screw up my physics test as badly as i thought and i got my presentation over with..no matter how crappy it was. track was good..cept the 16 laps bit, but still good. those middle schoolers are kicking our asses though..well they did only do 1/2 the workout, but still, when i was in middle school i would have died after one 800. it will be funny when they are running with varsity...yet still in middle school...ewww sick. 

so midterms..well first, look at this for history: thurs-unit test, fri-unit essay test, tues-INCLASS (our first yet) DBQ, wed-midterm. lemme just memorize the book..
anyways so...snow...please...

i just got a thing from furman...and i am even more excited about it. i havent even visited it yet and i love it. its just so perfect. 

speaking of perfect, i was driving around on..sometime this weekend and took some back roads and it was soo pretty. we seriously live in such a nice place. i was even considering that maybe it wouldnt be so bad to live here when i grow up..how crazy is that? ive lived here my whole life and im thinking about living here even when i dont have to?! i dunno..mebbe not. but it reminded me i want to go hiking/camping this summer. another thing to look forward to for summer. 

has anyone else noticed that everyones been really nice lately and theres not like so much cliqueishness and all that?"

"event","so i guess everything is pretty good.

i just realized that i really need to start working in school. i hate it becuase my parents dont pressure me at all...so all my motivation comes from me. i guess actually its good. but just frustrating. 

boys..theyre good now..but too many and im just stupid like this. i shouldnt have to have this problem..well..i could just forget it all, and then there would be no problem. so in conclusion i should follow emery's philosphy that dating is pointless and dumb. but that wont happen.

another conclusion is that i am way too materialistic. so time for me to put paychecks in the bank and that will hopefully reduce some of the problem. 

so there we have my 3 challenges."

"event","today was pretty good..nothing drastically good or bad. i dont understand physics though..its sick. i need to spend some time studying for that. and then i have my wonderful history presentation to do tonight for tomorrow..argh i hate presentations. 

track yesterday just sucked. i dont even understand it. it didnt feel terribly slow and i didnt feel so tired..yet i was +a lot..though everyone was around +40. after practice lac was like soo..how much you run over break...that might explain it. oh well i'll kick ass tomorrow. hopefully. just found out kellys running again starting tomorrow! which is awesome for her, but just more competition. ugh

umm boys suck...dont even want to think about that. 

so plans for this weekend, anyone?"

monday, i didnt get to hang out with emery after all, because my mom decided to guilt me out of it with 'well you shouldnt disrespect his religious rules etc and if his mom calls here im not lying for you 2' wtf. we're not even trying to date or something...why cant i be friends with him and hang out with him w/o making up stuff to do it. anyways..so he was kinda pissed about that. 

yesterday-work, with not just tom and ben but also adam, who i havent seen since last christmas break.crazy kid. and then we had people over..fun stuff...

today i hung out with nicko..who i also havent seen in a really long time. it was good..we went to find some food and then we went to the movies..but there was a long line so we dwent to his house and watched tv. it was really nice to talk to him though. 

so all in all...been a nice relaxing week so far and theres still good things to come...like new years!!"

"event","i love how i can be sitting at home on winter break and all im thinking about is whether i should go sleep or eat, and then i talk to someone and they talk about people at school that i hate/just dont want to think about. it makes me feel all gross and reminds me how much i dont want to go to school. even though schools really not so bad, i mean after awhile, what else is there to do?but still...i wish i could just delete whoever i wanted from our school and leave the decent people. 

this break is making me really want summer to come...it'll be so nice and warm, and it'll be my first summer that i can drive. and then i'll just have senior year. i'd seriously rather repeat freshman year that be seniors. all those underclassmen make me so mad...it was so much better being the youngest. i guess there's good things about being a senior too. 

anyways..i should go find something productive to do"

thursday i saw lemony snicket...most random movie ever! but it was fun anyways..

tomorrow i think im finally hanging out with emery, im so excited. oh, he got into syracuse, im so happy for him..now i just need to get in. though i think i'd choose furman over 'cuse right now. 

im really like this no school thing..its so relaxing and nice. but i hate having to run on my own, i went today only for like 25 minutes but it was cold and boring. at least we have practice on tuesday."

and then it'll be christmas eve! and my brother and i can spend the day trying to convince my parents that we wont go to church because church is creepy and cultish..i wonder if they know that chris is atheist too? well anyways, it should be pretty entertaining. 

ahh..so many nice boys in our school...i love how some days im like wow, they all suck, and then days like today i realize theres a bunch. whatever.

it doesnt feel like christmas at all! i hate this...i always love the time up till christmas, but this year its so uneventful and dull. cause once its christmas its like, yay presents..and then the day after just sucks cause you realize theres nothing good going on (cept new years) until spring when it gets warm...which is so far away! ahhh i want to go to italy or spain or somethign...anywhere warm.."

"event","today i almost died..well..i wasnt able to breathe anyways. i had 200 meters left of my last 3200m when i started like choking..and i had to stop, obviously. but no one was around..and i remember thinking, wow i could die right now. but then this boy  ran by me, and i was like heeelp as i was trying to breathe...so i suppose i could breathe a little bit or i dont know. so he looked back and then finally my throat got unclogged so i waved him on. anyways so i started running again but the choking feeling came back so i just jogged it in and got 16:40 instead of the 16:00 that Lac wanted..and i was liek Lac, i was choking ..i had to stop. and he just looks at me and says 'so you couldnt breathe, eh?' and i was like well yeah..and he just walks away. wtf...i could have died. anyways..so no records for me today...

so..who reads this? leave a comment.."

"event","i kinda just wanna stay up all night...never go to bed..but i know it will suck tomorrow. mebbe. i feel like i need to do something with my life..seriously, what am i doign now? i suppose school will help eventually, but i dunno. i just found out kat got into cornell, and kt into princeton, which is so awesome, but at the same time of course im jealous. im sure celia, jamie, angela and amy will all get into big schools too. not that it matters, i mean, you get the same education everywhere pretty much. its kinda dumb that way. its like clothes...you can get plenty of decent clothes without like nice brands..yet theyre still not the same. oh well. 

i want to take a road trip this summer..no parents, just me and a couple of friends driving around for a couple weeks. thatd be so sweet. i also want to go hiking in new zealand/australia. i need more no school time and $ to do that tho.

mon frere has been nice lately. i think he finally realizes that i just need him to be a friend and not try to screw me over all the time. hes even been giving me the car when he wants it too. 

i hope it keeps snowing...i really dont want to go to school..well just late maybe. 

i dunno if i already wrote about this, but i just finished this book about a girl who sails around the world by herself. how cool would that be..cept not by myself and not all the way around the world. just around somewhere in the carribean where its nice and warm and blue....

i still havent gotten presents for ppl other than chris. ive got like 4 days....and i have no idea what either. this is no good. 

im really not tired...ugh. oh well, we'll see when i got to bed..anyways, night."

"event","we just got our xmas tree...its the first time we've done it without my brother, which was kinda weird. i was talking to him last night and he was talking about this girl he likes and is going out with tonight and im excited for him. she sounds cool. 

my neighbor ran over her dog..accidently of course. ive known the dog since they got her when i was 6..whats funny is the day it happened, i was driving home from work. the mom was letting colin out at the bottom of the driveway to get the trashcan, and i saw daisy get out too. apparently mrs. s. didnt know daisy got out too...and it happened like right after i drove by. the bad thing is, i honked at colin..i dont rememeber if mrs s. was already driving up and around the corner..so i feel like mebbe i distracted her. i dont know. i cant really ask.. its crazy though."

what else is funny is that i drove home from work with the park brake on. so i can prolly drop i dunno how much $...too much.. on that. 

so...DC cubed isnt sounding too bad anymore.."

"event","i know i am obsessing about this...but i am seriously failing school. i mean, usually i'm kind of upset when i get straight B's..and other people get A's..but this is beyond bad. Lemme just list my averages right now:

Hon. Physics:71
AP. English:90(amazingly enough..from one vocab test)
Hon. French:85ish
Health: 91 
Ap. History: 76
Reg. Math: 79..ok i had a fucking 96 all MP..and now this stupid test, which btw is cumulative of all those quizzes i got 100s on screws me over

UGH. 

But, today was St. Nicholas Tag..and i got PJ pants and socks, which was very exciting. 

Track was funny...kinda. All those silly new ppl were liek hey..this is slow, lets show off and go fast. so on the second 32 they burned out..and we 3 xc runners, and this cool sophmore, ended up raping them and getting a minute under. hahaha..i love how competitive the xc runners get with non xc ppl. i guess its kinda dumb..but w/e. 

Ok. well im going to go repractice the physics problems ive done 3 times each already so i get a 100 tomorrow. and then im going to bed. yes. before 8. finally."

"event","i hate physics. i really do. i also hate that mr petsco cant teach and lac wont help. i even called nick..whos taking college level physics and he was like wtf..i dunno. mebbe he just didnt feel like thinking about it. but still. i have a 71. i already went over this..but im getting a bit worried. ok thats enough about that.

yesterday at practice was goood..it was just me and a bunch of shmen in our group, and we went nice and fast and it felt good. then i went to work where my boss yelled at me for not charging enough and screwing stuff up. im such a terrible employee..i cant believe i havent been fired in the year and 1/2 ive worked there. and then i was going to go to jareds..but i realized i didnt have his address so i take out my cell phone and yes, its dead. so i get really mad and start talking to myself as i drive around trying to decide what to do..cause i dont want to drive 20 min home and then back, so i went to lisa's to borrow a phone and they werent home. and then i went to kelly's and her parents of course still want me and kevin to be dating..i think..i dunno..so it was kinda akward telling them that i was trying to get to jareds house. anyways i finally get to jareds and we made brownies for mr husband for lending us his jumper cables. and i ended up eating there..and his dad is a jerk to jared and its so annoying. but his little sister anna is so cute and we were teaching her to spell. so i guess i'd say things with jared are comfortable.

i looked at french today and i realized i didnt even know some of the present tense conjugations..let alone the 5 other verb tenses im suppposed to know.mmm...school is just greatt...."

"event","school today was good..it felt like a friday tho.
track was fine...except theres so many non xc ppl..its kinda akward. lac called me over to the captain's ""meeting"" about practice on friday..which makes me think hes seeing how i would do as captain for next year. thats pretty cool...i always hoped i would be. 

amazingly enough, hannah (cause youre prolly the only one who'll read this) im having the same thoughts on career as you are.....well ok, today in english we were talking about what is the most vital paid profession. and i found myself pretty set on teachers and i was like arguing my point. and then i realized..wow it'd be so much better to be a teacher than an architect. like in school, when teachers do stuff..im always thinking kinda subconciously, when im a teacher i'll do it that way..or no i could do that so much better. plus, i could go to furman in SC, which sounds like the sweetest college ever, cept no architecture. anyways.. and i also always naturally do pretty well in like english and stuff and not math, so why fight my talents? but then, like you (hannah) wrote..they dont make a ton of money. which is ok i think..i think i'd do fine. of course my dad is constantly telling me about architecture crap and stuff i should be doing to make my chances of getting into school for that better..so he prolly wont like it but whatever. i'll be the 3rd generation teacher. ok. thats enough thinking for now."

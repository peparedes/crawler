"event","When I was in elementary school, in 2nd or 3rd grade, we were given an assignment to make a little illustrated book all about us.  One of the things we were supposed to tell about ourselves was what we wanted to be when we grew up.  I said I wanted to be a painter.  Not a painter like Vincent Van Gogh or anything silly like that, but I wanted to paint buildings.  There I was in the picture, paint bucket at my side, painting a building."

"event","So, I had my first day of school on Wednesday.  It was just as I remembered it: boring.  I was ten minutes late to my 8 AM class (I had underestimated the time it'd take to get there in snow and morning rush hour traffic), and the teacher had already given an assignment: a 2-4 page in class paper due that day.  Now, as much as I love writing (I don't), especially by hand (I really don't), this was annoying.  It's the first day, read the syllabus, get to know us or whatever bs, and let us out.  Fucking papers.

My next class was a finance class, taught by the always entertaining Professor Singh.  He has a thick accent, he's really boring, he's really bad at making people participate in class, and he grades on a curve, no matter what.  So if the class average is a 95%, a person with a 95% will get a 2.7.

Quick sidebar here about curves.  Frankly, I think they're ridiculous.  The point of school is to learn (in theory, anyway, which I'll get onto later).  Now, to give people a passing, or even good, grade if they get less than 50% of credit in a class (yes, it does happen), is asinine.  People can get a 4.0 without ever getting above 75% in any class, depending on teachers and classmates.  Any employer who hires someone with a 4.0 will expect that person to know his shit, inside and out, not 75% of it.  Should courses become easier, then, to eliminate the need for a curve?  Nope, unless they become easier because the professors teach better and the students simply know more.  I say fuck the curve.  Throw it out the window.  Sure, it'll mean most people currently in college won't be able to graduate.  But it will lend a lot more weight to a degree.  Employers will know who they're hiring will truly be of value.  That, or have a universal curve accross the entire university, or at least accross different sections of classes.  A 4.0 from one instructor does not necessarily demonstrate the same amount of knowledge as a 4.0 from another one.

Now, if they do institute the no curve thing (which they never would but that's hardly the point!), colleges will become much fewer and far between.  Most people won't be able to get into college.  And that's how it should be.  College, as it currently is, is bullshit.  Almost everything you learn in college is thrown out the window the first day of your job.  You have to learn entirely new and different things at your job, and they train you <i>on the job</i> even if you've been to college.  So why even bother with college?  Yes, for the undecided people, it does help in determining a career.  But so could another year of high school and better counseling.  Or, change college as it is.  I don't need a writing class for accounting.  I don't even need fucking math.  Public speaking, history, social sciences, science?  Nope.  College could teach me everything I need to know to become an accountant in two years, max.  But all those other classes just drag it out, are rather boring, and decrease my desire to go to school altogether.  The day before this semester started, I thought of going back to school again, and the mere thought of it bored the hell out of me.  I'm quite sick of it, I assure you.

/sidebar

So anyway, he goes on about the syllabus for awhile, then starts lecturing.  He encouraged people to participate, got little to no response, but kept trying.  You've got to respect that, eh?  So anyway, he was talking about budgeting, differences in interest rates between loans, blah blah, and he asked the class ""What's 4% of $15,000?""  It seemed at first that he really didn't know, but I think he figured it out relatively quickly.  I knew the answer before he finished answering the question, but I don't like answering things in class, unless called upon.  Why?  If I answer too often in class, people around me get it in their heads that I'm smart.  So they ask me for help, ask me to tutor them, ask me to do their homework, all sorts of crap like that.  If I help them out, they'll get a better grade.  The curve encourages you to kill or be killed, so I prefer to not help people out to preserve my grade.  Of course, if they ask, I'll help them no problem, but the key is to keep them from asking.  So!  After a long pause of people trying to figure it out, a guy in the back of the class says ""$6,000.""  Yeah, that's right buddy, on a 4% loan of $15,000 you're going to pay $6,000 interest per year.  Good one.  Don't get me wrong here, I wouldn't be mad at the guy if he was called upon.  But when you speak up of your own will with an answer, it means you're relatively certain of it.  And that one was just...wrong.  So I said the correct answer to get on with things because <I>it is really frustrating</i> listening to people.

Ah, and in that class, some girl who on first glance seemed pretty cute sat next to me.  She looked like a cross between Jeremiah's girlfriend (who everyone thinks is really cute) and Mrs. Robinson.  Anyway, after looking at her at the end of class, I determined she wasn't all that cute.  I did, however, give a cute girl directions early in the morn before my first class.  ^_^

My last class of the day is public speaking.  I was a couple minutes early to the class, but the teacher had already started.  She quickly got on my nerves, with a very egotistic attitude.  I knew right then that I wouldn't enjoy the class.  Public speaking is not something I terribly enjoy, but I don't really mind it, either.  I have my moments.  But then, after about fifteen minutes of class, she dismissed us.  What the fuck woman?  I'm supposed to be despising you here, and you let me out not halfway through the class.  I'm torn.

so that was my first day.  I have one other class on Monday, and I'll probably not talk about it in this journal, cause hey, I can only update so many times per year.  Hopefully it'll be the best class ever.  Wish me luck.  ;p

On a different, more fun topic, I've found myself enjoying some non-traditional gaming experiences.  Last Thursday, we went to Conyell's pad and played some Karaoke Revolution.  It was surprisingly fun, though I suck terribly at it.  I'm sort of *gasp* thinking about purchasing it.  If I thought my buds would play it with me, I would, but they're <I>lame</i>.  Also, I played the EyeToy at Best Buy.  While it does not recognize different parts of your body (you're supposed to head butt a ball in this soccer game, but you can use hands, shoulders, whatever) as it should, it's also kind of fun.  And, of course, I purchased Ninja Assault for PS2, a light gun game.  I only played it for about a minute, but I'm excited to usher in the days of light gun games on my PS2.  I've always loved them, donchaknow.

And Viewtiful Joe is simply...viewtiful.

Today, Porath and I went to Best Buy, among other places.  At Best Buy, I saw Carissa, one of Jeannine's friends, with one of her friends.  I walked by them, without paying them much mind.  Then, as I was leaving the isle, I saw Carissa's friend poke her head into the isle, look at me, and turn back around.  As I walked by I heard her say ""I don't recognize him.""  After a few more steps past them, I decided to go back and re-introduce myself.

""I'm Dan.""
*blank stare*
""Jeannine's friend.""
""Ohhhh.""
Then I walked away, pleased with imparting knowledge upon the curious.

"event","This was brought about because of a post from CBR.  These are my favorite movies, year by year, since 1990.

1990 - TMNT
1991 - T2
1992 - Aladdin
1993 - Jurassic Park 
1994 - Clerks
1995 - Toy Story
1996 - Star Trek: First Contact
1997 - Liar, Liar
1998 - The Truman Show
1999 - Dogma/Office Space
2000 - Snatch
2001 - LotR: FotR
2002 - LotR: TTT

1999 being too close to call between those two, and honorable mentions in the following years.  I've updated this since last time.  My old requirements for it were just movies that were very close to my favorite, but not quite.  Now, they are movies that I could watch twice back-to-back and not be sick of them.  Seemingly a big feat, but judging by these, I'm easy to please.

1992 - The Mighty Ducks, Wayne's World
1993 - Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, Groundhog Day, Robin Hood: Men in 
Tights, The Sandlot
1994 - Beverly Hills Cop III, The Mask, The Santa Clause
1995 - Batman Forever, Billy Madison, Die Hard 3, Empire Records, Mallrats, The Usual Suspects
1996 - ID4, Scream
1997 - Men In Black, The Lost World
1998 - Rush Hour
1999 - 10 Things I Hate About You, Big Daddy, Blair Witch, Boondock 
Saints, Deep Blue Sea, Star Wars
2000 - American Psycho, Blair Witch 2, Shanghai Noon, X-Men
2001 - Harry Potter, Rush Hour 2, Thirteen Ghosts, Vanilla Sky
2002 - Ice Age, Men In Black 2, Scooby Doo, Spider-Man

2002 will pry contain Harry Potter as well whenever I get around to watching it, and 2003 is not included because it is not done (though LOTR will obviously be number one).  And 1999 is the year of the bad movie that I like regardless.

Now, you people reading my journal, post your favorites.  A convenient site to get movies released year-by-year is moviefolio.com, though it misses the classic Thirteen Ghosts, among other smaller movies."

"event","It's been awhile.  Blackout 2003 has come and gone.  What happened on this day?  Well, I'll tell you a little tale.

It was early afternoon the second day of my mini-nonvacation-vacation.  Joe and I had planned to go to Flipside, Meijer's, and who knows where else?  I arrived at Joe's house ready for a full day of shopping bliss only to find out that his watch had recently broken.  No biggie, it's just a watch, right?  Surely it cannot be a foreshadowing of what is to come?  That would just be absurd!  I inform Joe to bring his cell phone with him, as the Focus is unavailable and both the Taurus and the Escort are not the most reliable automobiles.  I persisted, but he refused, saying the batteries were low.  The battery power necessary to call home and say ""THE CAR IS BROKEN COME PICK US UP KTHX"" is rather low, I would say, so I didn't really mind.  He continued to refuse and I let it go.  Off we go in the Taurus.

We arrive at Flipside, do some browsing, don't find anything great in particular.  Flipside owner man offers us some sports games for the Xbox and we high-tail it out of there.  Off we go in the Taurus again.

...or do we?  No sir, as the Taurus has broken down.  Without a cell phone on hand, we could not call home.  We made our way around a very small section of downtown Clawson before finding a pay phone.  Joe calls home, but only Sarah is there.  She cannot drive, but she'll call up Jessica to pick us up.  The directions Joe gave were a little shaky, which I didn't let him know until after he hung up.  It was funny, what can I say?  I enjoy a good laugh in the face of <i>imminent death</i>.  So we go on a quest to get some change and use the pay phone again.  This time we call Jessica directly, but no one answers.  I call my sister and she gives us a ride back to Joe's.  We grabbed his cell, then off we go in the Escort.

A quick visit to Meijer's and my house, then off we head to another Meijer's.  As we're driving southward, we hit a light that is not working.  Scary stuff, as no one can handle that, especially not in <i>nearly rush hour</i> so I proceed cautiously.  After another one passed, I decided to get off the road for a little bit to wait the power outage out.  We see another light off as I head towards Hollywood Video.  After a quick browse in the darkened store, I get bored and decide to brave the road, at least to Joe's.  I decided to take a different route this time, as hopefully Rochester Road would be all right.  Turning on Newsradio 950, however, I found out that this was not the case.  Massive blackout blah blah, you know the story.  My mind quickly flashes to my friends and family, hoping they're safe.  Luckily, I knew Joe was, as he was with me, and Porath would be, as he was working.  Plus I knew my sister and mom were snugly in my house, so that was cool.

After two miles, the Escort refuses to break the 30 MPH barrier and I decided to let it rest briefly as I thought it was overheating.  After a five minute or so rest, we head out again.  It's doing all right for a little bit, but then craps out again.  I went through Kyle's sub as the speed limit was low enough that the 30 MPH driving wouldn't be dangerous.  Halfway through the sub, we smell burning and decide it best to stop driving and walk the rest of the way home.  About this time, after Joe's lost his watch and didn't bring his cell phone, along with both of our cars breaking down and the continent-wide power outage, it is beginning to look like the end of the world.  All because Joe wouldn't buy Diddy Kong Racing.

We're a mile, a mile and a half from Joe's and he doesn't know how to get home.  I'm not sure the quickest way to do so, exactly, but I take my chances.  The quickest way, it turns out, was through a small forest.  I encouraged Joe to pick up a large stick to defend himself with, while I would use my bare hands, as a monk should.  So we take a nice nature trail, then do a river crossing exercise on some rocks and get back into Joe's sub.  Shortly after, we're at Joe's house, chilling with his family.

There is very little to do without electricity.  I called my house to let my parents know I was okay, but no one answered.  Probably busy readying the guns.  We called Porath's as well to make sure he made it home safe, but no one answered there either.  Twas slightly distressing.  To relieve our nerves, we decided to play some Monopoly.  One game was had in daylight, the second by candlelight.  Candlelight is not the best in terms of lighting up a Monopoly board.

Sleep was had and enjoyed by all.  The next day, power was restored and life began to get back to normal.

So that was my blackout 2003 experience.  Much fun.  Fast forward to this week.  Jeannine was supposed to have a BBQ on Friday.  It has since been canceled, but I will tell the story regardless.  I asked Rom to switch his Saturday 9-5 with my Friday 6-C over the phone.  He agreed without much question.  The next day:

""So why is it that we switched?""
""I've got a BBQ to go to.""
""You've gotta be kidding me.""
""Nope.""
""It's a family BBQ or something, right?  Like a family reunion.""
""Nope.""
""Whose is it?""
""Jeannine.""
""Who is that?""
""She works at 18/Rochester.""
""She does?  Is she a manager?""
""Yeah, she's an opener.""
""The small girl that was here earlier today?""
""Yeah, that's her.""
""She's cute.""
""Yep.""
""Okay, switching is fine.""

Oh that Romuald.  Only saying switching is fine because Jeannine's cute.  Silly man.  I told Lisa about the BBQ today and this was the conversation:

""Why wasn't I invited?""
""Actually, Jeannine said specifically to keep you from coming.""
""What!  She doesn't even know me!""
""Sure she does, she works at 18 and Rochester.""
""Is she your girlfriend?""
At which point I smile, as I KNEW Lisa was going to ask that and reply ""Nope.""
""She must be your girlfriend, you're lauhging!""
""Yep.  That's it Lisa.  Only guys with girlfriends can laugh.""

I hate not knowing."

So, Lisa changed my schedule for this week without telling me.  I'm working Friday instead of Saturday.  Friday I'll be working 9-2, so I can still hang out with the girl consortium as planned, and Saturday I am off, so I can still hang out with Hannah, if she doesn't find something better to do.  Conyell mentioned something happening on Friday, and I was like ""I don't care, I'm not working"" and he said ""Yes you are"" to which I eloquently responded, ""WTF"".  But it's all good, I guess.  I can have Saturday off and relax and whatnot.  Good times will be had.

Lisa is starting to go crazy, I think.  On Friday or Saturday, she gave the managers free AMC passes because she hooked up some AMC dude with some food.  She was like ""You can't trade food for movie tickets.""
""You know, Lisa, one day, I'm going to work my way up the ladder of McDonald's and become a head manager, so I can trade food for movie tickets and <i>show you.</i>""

Today, she gave me a free Six Flags ticket.  I'm debating whether or not to go.  I've never been, doncha know, but Cedar Point soured me on theme parks for awhile.  I could give it to my sister, as she is coming into town quite soon, or I could give it to Francesca as a birthday present, but I'm not sure she'd want it.  Then, of course, there's always my brother, who would make good use of it.  Decisions, decisions.

Anyway, with the way it is building, I am expecting a free car by the end of next week.  Wish me luck.

Over the last ten days, I have started Metroid Prime, Red Faction, and Worms 2.  They are all enjoyable games, it seems.  I've yet to really delve into RF, so I can't say for sure.

Reema and Francesca have been gone for much, if not all, of this time, and of course I miss them <i>terribly.</i>  Francesca had a birthday a few days ago, I hope you all had the opportunity to wish her a happy birthday.  I was supposed to call her at 3 AM to wish her a happy birthday, but I just couldn't stay up that late that night.  So I called her at 2 and the voice mail lady answers ""Please call again later.  Goodbye.""  WTF is that?  She was totally PMSing.  So I decided to call her at the other extreme, 11:58 PM on her birthday.  I cut it a little close, but that's me, Mr. Dangerous.

Hannah was also gone for quite a bit of that time.  Before she left, she mentioned never seeing Big, so I was like YOU MUST SEE THIS because it is a must see, and we agreed to see it when she got back.  I was all ""You sure?  Cause I'll take the day off because YOU MUST SEE THIS IMMEDIATELY"" and she agreed, and a day off was had.  She came back a little early, on the night of the 17th, rather than sometime on the 19th, so I invited her along to my Marissa get together because <i>the more the merrier</i> as they say.  We went swimming.  As you may remember, the weather on Saturday wasn't all that hot, so the ladies were complaining about being cold.  We were playing Frisbee, and Hannah insisted that I stay in the sunlight so they could stay warm.  I obliged, as I'm such a great guy.  Anyway, I got quite the sunburn due to not being able to stay in the shade, and I blame Hannah.  It is her fault, I assure you.

After swimming had ended, I walked the girls to Hannah's car, and Hannah said she would call me the next day, seemingly confirming our earlier plans.  So I was all AIGHT L8R.  The next day, I awoke at 10 or 11, who really knows, watched some TV or whatever.  My father was online for a good portion of that time, so I figured if she was trying to call, she pry couldn't get through, so around noon, I gave Hannah a call.  She was going out to lunch with a friend, but was going to call me later.  I watched some TV, made some lunch, played some Metroid Prime, and otherwise occupied my time.  Around 3:30, I was beginning to think I would not be called back, so I decided that hanging out with Mr. Porath and Mr. Joe would be opportune, as I had not seen them in awhile, and they are neat.  We hung out, much fun was had, and Joe bought approximately 1/1000th of what I suggested.  Porath bought a startling 0%.  You're really slacking, I must say, Porath.  If you don't buy at least twice as much the next time we hang out, I'm going to have to reevaluate our friendship.

Earlier today, McDonald's called me at 2:01 PM.  I didn't get to the phone in time, though I wouldn't have answered it anyway.  Psh, don't call me when I'm not working, I work 40 hours, talk to me then.  Since the person did not leave a message, I certainly wasn't going to call back to discover the horrible news.  At 2:17 PM, Lisa called and left a message on my machine, approximately the following: ""Hi Dan, this is Lisa, call me back when you get home.""  I called her back after brushing my teeth.

""McDonald's, Lisa speaking.""
""Yeah, this is Dan.""
""This is Lisa Anne Pruccoli, your store manager.""
""...yeah...""
""I wanted to know if I can change your schedule for next week.""
""Okay....""
""...""
""...""
""...""
""What days?""
""Oh, you wanted to know when?""
""Yeah, I think that might be helpful.""
""Can you close Sunday at <i>18 and Rochester</i>?  I'll give you Monday off.""
""Uh...probably, I'll check to make sure I have no plans and let you know when I work."" (I worked an hour later)
""I need to know now!""
""Uh....right.  Well *considers it for a second, realizes he doesn't have anything to do, ever* sure, why not?""
""KTHX.""
""Of course.  I'm a very nice young man, you know.  Later.""
""Do you want Saturday off instead of Monday?""
""Wha?  I was pretty sure I wanted to hang up on you."" <--- this is slightly paraphrased.
""I can switch your days off if you want, so they're not both during the week.""
""I'll think about it and let you know, if that's all right.""
""...""
""Bye.""

That is all that is exciting right now, other than the fact that I get to work with Mr. Mills for 8 hours tomorrow and Porath for 7.  It'll be great, ESPECIALLY if Lisa is not there, though she pry will be cause she is teh sux.

I'm also supposed to go back to school shopping with Marissa and Hannah, which sounds quite terrifying.  Luckily, I am supposed to be there not because I have some gay fashion sense, but because I'm supposed to see if their outfits are ""hot"" I think.  And if it's because I have some gay fashion sense, they obviously have not been paying any attention to me.  But really, shopping for clothes with girls?  It's a terrifying prospect.

Hold me."

Francesca may not be a lesbian, but she really should be.  She'd be a good lesbian, I can tell.

Today, Diyana was an idiot.  Francesca, do not read this paragraph or the next, as you apparently don't want to know what she did.  Diyana, for those who don't know, is a manager in training at our store.  She's worked there for 8 months or so and been in training for about two months now.  So, one would expect that she knows how to do every position.  Keep in my that she doesn't do grill much, as she's not very good at it.  So, one would at least assume that she's good in all the service positions.  One would be horribly, horribly wrong, as I found out today.  I had her in back cash today for the two hours of my shift that she was working.  Well, she changes the order of the people who had just ordered on the second register, which as we all know by now should not be done.  The register thinks ""Hey, I'm the register for people paying, the only way you're going to modify an order on me is if that order's at the window, so <i>I won't let you go to any other order</i>.""  And, well, that's all well and good as long as you know that and don't modify anything until the car comes to the window.  I can even understand that she may never have had that problem before in the 8 months she's worked there, though that is horribly unlikely.  What I can't understand is why she can't understand how to deal with it herself.  The same problem happened to me a long time ago, I didn't whine to a manager that I didn't know what to do, I was just like ""Okay, this can be dealt with in like 2 seconds"" and dealt with it.  So what you have to do is you have to cancel the order, then ring it up again when the car actually comes to the window.  To cancel it you cannot simply cancel everything, our computer will not allow it.  You must Promo it off, which is telling the computer you have a coupon for the order.  Since we don't have the coupon for it and our supervisor is now checking our promos to make sure we're not giving away free food/stealing money, we have to promo off a salad dressing, as it's a universal sign of ""hey, we don't have a coupon but someone fucked up.""  She says ""Do you want me to promo it all off?""  ""No, of course not, we don't want to promo off all that.  Put a salad dressing on there, cancel the rest, then promo it off.  Then, you're going to have to ring the order up again when it comes to the window."" then I went to help out somewhere else, figuring Diyana could do something when I told her all the details of how to do it.  How wrong I was.  She adds the salad dressing, then promos the whole order off.  So we've got a $10 order that we're not going to have coupons and Mike's going to throw a fit <i>because that's what he does</i> and I'll tell him to quit bothering me and that it's not my fault <i>because that's what I do</i>.  So that held up customers for awhile.

Later on, some car must have left the line.  This is another case where we will promo an order off, as the customer is gone and we just ain't getting that money.  So, Diyana hit the ""next car"" button and went on her merry way, rather than promoing the order off.  It takes about 5 seconds to promo an order off, so it certainly wasn't a time constraint.  I noticed that the orders were out of order like that a minute or two after it happened, but figured Diyana would take care of it.  I went about my business, helping grill, making fries, all the good stuff necessary when we are busy and have a line.  Later on, I look at the DT screen and see that order for the missing car still on the screen, with a time of over 1200 seconds since the order was taken.  Seeing as how our DT goal is 90 seconds, you can see how this would mess up my DT times not only for that hour, but for the entire day because it is SO FUCKING CRAZY.  I was like WTF and took care of it right away, let Diyana know that she should have taken care of it 20 minutes before, and went on my merry way.  In the future, I will not trust Diyana will take care of anything.

Fuck, even Alisha, one of the biggest slackers in the history of McDonald's, was better than Diyana today.  The future of our store looks bleak indeed.

Thankfully, Francesca worked till 9 and I had Cindy and Jennifer C closing, so it was a good night after Diyana left.

Yesterday after work, I hung out with Grant, Reema, Marissa, Francesca, and Marissa's whipped friend Brian.  Gra, Ree, and Fra went bowling while I watched (I decided last summer that I will never bowl again, so I abstained), then we went to the Lakeside Mall food court to eat, I believe the same people ate while Marissa, Brian, and I all refrained from doing so.  Then we headed to McDonald's.  It was 9:30 or so at night and Conyell had big lines in DT and counter, and I was just like WTF.  I don't understand it when he's in charge or Abdul is, it's total chaos.  I wish Lisa wouldn't have Conyell be one of the people to train Yan Yan and Diyana how to run shift, but what are you gonna do?  At least Rom and I will talk some sense into them.  I'm certainly glad Rom was the one to teach me how to run shift, he is the best at our store.  Back on the topic, if you will, Grant and Reema headed off to have sex or whatever, while the four <i>cool people</i> went to Meijer's.  We went to the world famous Buzz Cutting Meijer's at 16 and Van Dyke, Marissa bought some stuff and acted like a 12-year old, Brian acted like a 5-year old, Francesca went through puberty, and I was simply embarassed.  I sat on wicker furniture, which is not comfortable, while Marissa believed she could see stars not only through an awning over the rocking chair she was sitting on, but also <i>through the Meijer's roof</i>.  I humored her as best I could.

Fortunately for Marissa, she's back on my good list, as she fulfilled one of the two possibilities for being forgiven.  Good job, Marissa.  I thought she was cool before the dark days, cause she was some <b>gamer</b> and was also cute, then came the dark days, and now she's back on my A-List.

Oh yes.  As some of you may know, Rom and Abdul had a survey as to who was more attractive, and Rom obviously destroyed Abdul in that contest.  Reema, the only person who didn't immediately say Rom, told me one day that I was ""just as cute as Grant"" which made me want to rip off all my skin and start over.  Luckily, my self-esteem isn't so bad as to believe that, but I polled people at work today about who was more attractive, me or Grant, and I won in the same kind of rout as Rom did against Abdul.  I will not, however, be vying for the title of most attractive manager against Rom, as I am not prepared for the heartbreak.  Heck, I can even see Abdul as being seen more attractive.  A sane person could say that <i>all the guys who work there</i> and are under 30 are more attractive than me, and I wouldn't mind.  But against Grant?  Well, let's just say that Reema is not a sane person.

"event","Today at work was fun.  And by ""fun"" I mean ""Jennifer doesn't know how to schedule people because she is an idiot.""  Well, I guess that's what I mean by the whole first sentence, rather than just the word fun, as that would make no sense.  Anyway, here's the deal.  I had the following people from 1-4: Mike, Lisa X, Mark, Matt, Gerta (who left at 3), and Suetlana (who came in at 2).  The problem, of course, with this schedule is that while Mark and Mike technically know how to do back cash, they mess up at least 10% of the orders, which is probably an understatement, rather than an exaggeration.  Lisa X knows everything, but she's the best of the gang in grill, by far, so she had to be there.  Gerta only knows how to make meat.  Matt knows the service positions as well as meats, but he's pretty incompetent in all positions, so he's a ""meat person"" if you will.  Suetlana, who has worked there for about two weeks now, only knew how to make fries, which would be pointless as it is grill that needed help the most, then service positions, but fries were a far cry from where she was needed.  That, plus Mike had to go on break and weeds had to be pulled (which takes like two hours).  So basically, the only person who could handle drive thru positions was also the only person who could handle grill, which takes precedence.  Jen could easily have scheduled someone who knew a service position to, y'know, help make things run smoother, but <i>that would just be silly.</i>  I would've traded Mark and Suetlana for a Francesca, Chris, Eric, or a handful of others, no doubt.  But why schedule people who can do drive-thru when you can schedule two meat people and a fry person?

So...yeah, today didn't run as smoothly as possible, but I managed, given the circumstances.  Considering the fact that I had only 5 people on the floor from 12-1, I think I did well.  Those five people were competent people (well, at least three of them were, anyway), rather than the five mentioned above, so I wasn't really worried.

I think I might have hurt Mark's feelings today, though.  Yan Yan had him on back cash, and three great workers up front.  Now, let me tell you something.  If you have to have someone who is weak in a service station, you don't want them in one of the DT positions.  Either counter or a counter runner, as counter is far less busy than drive-thru and you're right there up front to help if any problems arise, rather than it being waaaaaaaaay in the back.  So, I was in front DT while Mark was in back cash, and every couple orders a problem arose, as Mark apparently doesn't listen to the customers when he takes their orders.  I don't know if he's trying to mess up to be funny or if he's not even wearing a headset and just guessing at what the customers want, but whatever method he's using, it doesn't work.  After the fifth or so order that was messed up in the ten minutes I was in front DT, I yelled at Yan Yan ""YOU HAVE TO GET MARK OFF BACK CASH.""  Which she did, but Mark seemed a bit upset about it.  He keeps telling me he wants to do back cash, cause we always put him on counter, but that's <i>the only position he can work</i>, so that's where I put him.  So, sorry Mark, but customers come first.  Then McDonald's.  Then me.  After that, you're up there on the list.

So you all know I think Eric W. Mills is a pretty neat guy.  And well, he is.  He knows how to play a whole heap of instruments, he's a smart fella, he's mature, he's an awesome worker, he's hilarious, and he was even quoting scripture for us.  I kind of think he should be a preacher when he grows up, but I don't know if he likes the idea of that.  Anyway, he and I were hanging out in the crew room after we both got off about a week ago, just talking about this and that.  Jowana was doing back cash at the time and she was like ""You guys laugh all the time"" and I was like ""SORRY, but Mr. Mills here is a funny man.""  So, I guess the point of this is VOTE ERIC MILLS 2004, you'll be glad you did.

Tis the fourth of july weekend and everyone's out of town.  I miss you terribly, Hannah and Francesca.  Have safe trips.  Don't die.  Dying is bad, mmkay?  Kthx.  L8r.

Greetings, true believers.  So, I just read Superman For All Seasons by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale.  Good stuff.  I don't know if it quite lived up to the hype of the Loeb/Sale books, but that's highly irrelevant.  It was a neat little story, if not <i>the best story ever</i>.

I made a quiz.  You take the quiz, then I see how well you did and laugh at you.  It's fun.

A witch!  Oh Rishi, you're a funny man.

So apparently, when we left Reema's to head off to McDonald's on Thursday, Reema left the garage door open and Moureen wasn't amused.  To save herself, she told Moureen that the rest of them left to go to Marissa's while I watched the house.  While they were gone, I remembered a manager meeting I had to attend, so I booked it out of there.  I <i>tried</i> oh so hard to close the garage door, but golly, there was a motion sensor on it that opens it if someone walks in front of it, and I just couldn't think of a way to circumvent such a heinous device, so I decided to abandon the house for <i>thieves</i> and head off to a manager meeting.  When I heard the story, I told Reema it was a complete insult to my intelligence that I couldn't think to step over the motion sensor or close the garage, then head out the front door.  And, of course, it is, but I could care less what Moureen thinks of me.  The problem I had with it was that I was expected to apologize for what I did wrong.  The problem I had was in lying.  I don't have great allegiances to Moureen in specific that I care that she know the truth, I just really don't like lying.  And, well, becoming that which I hate the most is not my favorite thing in the world.  I wasn't going to go to the party because of it, but I realized that I would have had to deal with it the next time I saw Moureen if I didn't do it today and I didn't want to get Reema into more trouble, so I might as well enjoy the party while I'm at it.  So, yeah, hopefully I will not be forced to lie again.

Speaking of people from the party, Grant is such an antisocial cock sometimes.  Silly Grant.

A couple people told me my journal is like so totally funny.  It's like W00T I HAVE FANZ!!!!!1111  Personally, I find humor much more difficult to convey in writing than in person.  My storytelling is more skillfull when I have time to think about it and edit, but overall, it's still pretty weak.  I'm much more funny in person, I assure you.  You should be all like ""Oh Dan, you're so funny in person.  Let me remove my clothing so I can jump your bones plz.""

During the Fourth of July shindig, after a few people had left, the boys decided to go across the street to see if there were any hot girls over there.  There weren't.  But this funny foreign man, who I can only assume is some terrorist ringleader, gave us a box of fireworks, then gave each of us a Roman candle.  Thanks, funny foreign man!   You so crazy!  I shot mine in Reema's general direction, but I don't think she noticed till the last one.  'Tis a shame, as a moving target would have been more fun.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

So, Reema wasn't allowed by Moureen to work her schedule tonight, so she had to get someone to cover her.  I let her know all the people who could possibly do it, but apparently none of them panned out.  So Abdul called Diyana.  When I said ""all the people who could possibly do it"" I meant ""all the people who could possibly do it without Lisa unnecssarily yelling at me.""  Next time I see Lisa, she's going to be all ""WHY DID DIYANA WORK WITH ABDUL ON SATURDAY NIGHT?""  To which I will reply, ""You know, it would be nice if you actually asked the people involved in the situation, rather than asking me all the time.  I know I hold a great deal of knowledge on trivial McDonald's matters, but wouildn't it be more beneficial to go to the source first?  That would be quite convenient, as I don't like you being a bitch.  Thank you and goodnight.""  So THX PORATH for not working so I can experience more wholesome Lisa conversation.  It'll be great.

People are funny."

Used to be a guy would say he's broken something and his friends would at least question him on it.  But you're all trying to be Marissa's and just being like ""Let's play Frisbee.""  I hate you all.

So I walked into my house today, and my dad was like ""Who was that little blond that was over?""
So of course, I thought to myself, ""SHE'S SIXTEEN, OLD MAN"" but didn't say that.  Instead, here is the intellectually stimulating conversation that followed.
""Marissa.""
""Melissa?""

Now, okay, it's fine if she was the only person there, as I've been asked who people were individually when I brought them over.  But he had never before seen Hannah or Francesca and probably wouldn't remember Grant, so c'mon.  Quit being some horndog, plz.

Oh, and I got to learn that there's still something that can really piss me off and make me violent.  It's a good thing to know.  If it were anyone other than Marissa, I would have been more violent, but since I don't know her well, I held back.  Speaking of which, someone who knows Marissa and is reading this, remind me about it, cause there is a way I will forgive her, and I'd like one of you to deliver the message.

I think my nose is swelled up a bit.  I can't be sure, cause I really never do pay attention to myself if I look in the mirror, but it hurts and it seems like it may be bigger than normal.  We'll see if it's all bruised or smth tomorrow.

""Who am I going to train on truck?""
""Eric and Chris.""
""Could you find two skinnier guys to do it?...No, probably not.  Can I just train Yan Yan and Caroline (two diminuitive Azn grrls) how to do it?  I'm sure they'd be much more effective.""

So, I am working at the McDonald's at 11 mile road and Greenfield tomorrow.  I readily agreed when first asked to do it, as I'm always up for more work, and it meant 11 hours of overtime pay.  That is what I like to call ""the sweet life.""  I still have no quarrels about the over 50 hour work week, but I'm a little...anxious...about being in charge for 9 hours at a completely foreign store with people I don't know.  Hopefully the opening manager will be able to help me out as to where to position everybody, but it'll still pry be crez.  And Lisa was like ""You're going to be earning your pay that day"" or smth, cause apparently the people there will not be good.  And whipping them into shape will be stressful, being that I'll have to position them all and get them breaks and all that good stuff.  Hopefully we're adequately staffed and it's not busy.  Changeover will still sux, though.  So if you're out in Oak Park, come on by.  Thx.

Lisa's going to go to Vegas to go to some McD's store manager meeting.  Hopefully someone will destroy whatever hotel they're staying in and Rom and Andre will become store managers.  Maybe even me :).  Juuuuuuuuuuuuust kidding.  Plz don't kill all the McD's store managers.  Some are good people."

Hung out with Eric W. Mills, Rom, Porath, and Kate last night.  Watched part 1 of An Evening with Kevin Smith.  It's some good stuff.  Tim Burton is teh sux.  Anyway, it was all pretty normal during the Porath household visit.  After that, Rom, Eric, and I went to McD's.  Nothing much happened, I ate, Rom left.  Eric and I were going to depart, as Yetta came in.  That, in fact, <i>may</i> have been the reason we were leaving.  Anyway, we talked for a bit in the parking lot, Eric whipped out his Pogo Stick.  I tried it out, but I'm no Eric W. Mills on it.  Anyway, Yetta had left her car on, in the middle of the parking lot.  And by in the middle, I mean between the Drive-Thru lane and the parked cars, so getting around it was a tight squeeze if you had a small car.  These kids come behind it, sit there for a second, and start honking (it's night, so they can't really see that there be no driver.)  Eric tells them that no one's inside, so they're like ""WTF"" and start trying to squeeze between the car and the parked cars (there was a line in DT).  When they get even with her car, the driver opens her passenger side door and drives off.  Eric keeps complaining about the kids, saying that they needed to stick around to see her reaction.  ""It's like eating without being able to taste.""  Yetta comes out a couple minutes later and asks if they did anything to her car.  ""Nope, they just opened it and drove off.""  She starts muttering stuff about beating their asses or something.  The kids drive by and yell at her.  She starts walking towards them and they drive away.  She mutters more stuff about them, and asks Eric if they go to Stevenson.  He didn't know, I didn't know.  ""They're A-rabs, I know that.""  She bitches about them more and about what happened.  And Yetta is quite the white trash.  So while in this scene, I just kept thinking to myself ""I am in an episode of cops right now.  Youth hooliganism, white trash swearing, and two calm guys observing the situation.""

Keeping this from being an actual episode of Cops was Eric, egging the situation on.  He yelled at the kids to stick around, then when they came back he was advising them on how to properly pull a prank, then when Yetta met up with them, he was encouraging her to kick their asses.

"event","Today was the first day that I ever had to kick someone out of McD's.  This kid who's about 10 comes up to counter while Diana's in the back stocking something.  He came up with a half-inch or so fry and was like ""Do you give refunds on individual fries?  Cause this one's nasty.""  Yeah, one fry out of dozens and dozens that's nasty, and he wants a refund.  Anyway, ""Uh...no.  If you had a problem with your fries when you started eating, I'd be glad to replace them.  But,"" *looking over at kid's table, sees that all the other fries are eaten,* ""after you've finished your fries, we don't tend to give refunds.""  ""Aw man.  The other managers do.""  ""Sorry dude.""  So the kid walks to his table, a bit upset.  So I'm standing there a couple minutes later, writing something on the schedule, and see this fry fly by me, like 5 feet away.  I couldn't tell where it came from at first, but I pieced it together.  The kid was by the drink station, which is mostly covered up, out of sight, so I couldn't see him.  I did look at his table, and saw his two friends there.  They avoided looking at me, but I looked away for a minute, then looked back, to catch them, and they were laughing as their friend was walking back to their table.  I started walking out there, and by the time I was halfway to their table, they pointed to their friend and was like ""It was him!""  Good friends.  I guess a 20 year old can be scary to some 10 year olds, though, even if it's just me.  ""I know.  All of you need to get out of my store right now.""  ""But he did it.""  ""Yeah, he did.  And you're going to get out of my store.  I'll get you a bag for the rest of your stuff if you want, but you have to go.""

Good times, good times.

So the other Friday, the one I mentioned in a journal entry, with the 80 McChickens and such, Mike (a McDonald's supervisor in the area) walked in like 2 minutes after I started.  I was in charge, and there was a big line on counter when I came in.  They were waiting on food, right?  So I go back and help in grill.  Mike walks in while I'm busily making food and he's like ""Someone's gotta take care of that line.""  So I just responded with ""Yeah, I know, thanks,"" and went back to work.  It's not like talking to him was going to make the line move any faster, nor was going up front to help out there, when they were all waiting on sandwiches.  So he walked away, he seemed a little irritated.  So a couple of days later, I see Lisa, and she's like ""I hear you gave Mike a hard time on Friday.""  ""Uh...what?  Here's what heppend (explained what happened).  I guess Mike was upset that I didn't respond with ""Oh, Mike, you are my god.  Thank you for opening my eyes to this line out front that I would not have possibly seen without your supreme guidance.  Oh what would I do without you here?""  Now, I could've said that.  I really could have and should have.  What the fuck do you take me for, Mike?  You think I can't see a line?  You think I'm not working here to bring it down?  Honestly, Mike, I know how to do my job.  I don't need you here acting like you're God's gift to me to run the store.

So I mentioned the BBQ at Reema's, yes?  Yes.  What I didn't mention was the food.  I didn't really have any of the BBQ, and only had some small snacks, but after the first round of Frisbee, we had a break.  Reema's mom offered cake, and Ben asked for ice cream.  Reema asked if we wanted any and told us what she had.  She had Vanilla slices and cookies 'n cream.  Not being a big fan of cookies 'n cream, I opted for the vanilla slice.  Big mistake.  Vanilla slices look really good on the box.  They look all rectangular and thin, like one would think a slice would look.  In practice, they're just some blob of ice cream, holding no definite shape.  They also taste uncannily like glue.  All in all, not the best snack.

After the BBQ, when most of the people had left, Reema, Ben, Grant, and I were hanging out outside.  Moureen, Reema's mom, wanted us all to leave, as she had guests sleeping over, cause they were hammered.  Anyway, we were talking about sneaking out, but the fact that Moureen would notice us not being there came up in all of our attempts at it.  So Ben, finally, came up with a solution.  ""I'll take one for the team.  I'll go inside, have another beer, and seduce Reema's mom.""  The part of this sentence that Reema took offense to was the ""have another beer part"" to which Reema replied ""My mom's <i>hot</i>!""  So we mentioned it a little bit, but never proceeded.  A little bit later, Moureen poked her head out and asked Reema to help clean.  While they were inside cleaning, Ben's like ""50 bucks says I can nail her.""  Grant and I took that bet.  Later, Reema came out, and Moureen asked us to leave again.  Ben went inside and gave us the ""thumbs up"" with a big smile.  It was classic.  Sadly, he did not wind up accomplishing his goal.

Dana came in today and applied to be a manager.  Being that she's only home for summer and her availability is pretty slim, it's not looking good for her to become a manager.  Time will tell, I guess.  She has a friend who works at another McD's who is going to try to transfer to ours, cause she doesn't feel comfortable working with all the guys there.  They hit on her and whatnot.  Yeah, I'm sure she'll feel really comfortable when the second assistant is all over her.  Still, she seems like she'd be hot if all these guys are all over her, so it'll be nice having her around.  And, admittedly, the sexual innuendo isn't nearly as bad as a couple of years ago, when all my old crew worked there.  I walked in on many, many conversations dealing with sex in those days.  Today, not so much.

Speaking of which, though, I asked Ryan M. to get ice for Jowana one day.  He went and filled the ice in the back, to bring up front.  When he came up with it, he was like ""Take off your top, Jowana"" meaning for her to take off the cover to the ice at her drink station.  I, however, did not see it that way.  But I was the only one, till I made a comment about it.  Silly coworkers."

"event","Happy birthday, Rick.  I know I'm a couple days late, but I thought of it just the morning after, and I haven't seen you in years, so I don't think it's that bad.  Anyhow, good luck, buddy.  Don't die plz!

Last night there was some BBQ at Reema's.  We played keep away Frisbee for hours and hours.  It was great.  I may have hurt the girls cause I play Frisbee FOR KEEPS.  Sorry girls.  I'm sore all over, if it's any consolation.  Anyway, it was fun.  Reema kept taking off my pants, though.  Silly Reema.

Last night I had some ka-razy dream.  I don't remember exactly how it all started, but here were the stars:
Grant as Grant
Reema as Reema
Hannah as Hannah
Francesca as ""Frankie""
 and <B>STARRING</B> Dan as Dan/Batman

So at first, we were all in McDonald's.  Someone was lying about something, but I don't remember what.  I was pissed, but didn't really do anything.  Then, Hannah was lying about...something else, and I got really pissed, bopped her with a Frisbee, and stormed out.  Someone else had driven, so I didn't have a car.  It was cold and raining, and I was wearing a short sleeve shirt, but I was pissed, so I was gonna walk home on my own.  Interrupting my walk home, however, was The Joker, who came after me with a bazooka.  He shot it in my direction, but I flipped out of the way.  Then, he drove off, laughing all the way.  After that, I resumed my walk.  The trip from McD's to my house is not a terribly complicated one.  Nor is it terribly far away.  However, by nightfall, I realized I was lost.  Wondering where I was, the other stars of the dream showed up, on foot.  One would assume that if they were looking for me, they would do it by car, to do so more quickly.  One would also assume that, since I later discovered we were lost in Detroit, they probably would not want to walk there.  One would be wrong.

So I guess we sort of made up.  I had to do so, as I was lost and they were my best chance of getting home.  I was still pretty pissed, though!  First, we slept in some creepy guy's lightouse, which didn't scare us in the least, no sir.  It seemed perfectly natural.  When we woke up, we started walking home together.  The Joker attacked me with a bazooka again and drove away before I could catch him, again.  We crossed some bridge, I thought we were going to Canada, but everyone else seemed to think we were going home.  It seems that they weren't the best at finding the correct path home, as before I knew it, we were entering Bush Gardens.  Now, I don't know about you, but the only Bush Gardens I'm aware of is in Florida.  How we got there, I'll never know.  This Bush Gardens wasn't like the real thing, not quite.  The only way I knew it was Bush Gardens was because there was some sign that said ""Now Entering Bush Gardens"" like one of those ""Now Entering Troy"" signs.  Also, the main thing that I saw there was just a small, wooden bridge.  One that looked like...well...like a pier (took me a minute to think of the word there), but it extended accross this lake.  Anyway, it was only about five or six feet wide and had no railing.  So of course, I decided to run accross it.  It was a lot scarier than it would've been if it were real life.  Anyway, when I got to the end, I realized I had no keys or wallet.  I was quite upset, as we were still very lost, and I might need money for food and stuff.  My co-stars shared my worry, and I realized it must've been that creepy guy who had the lighthouse who must've stolen my money.  But then...I woke up.

Also, Joker showed up once or twice more, with pretty much the same result.  I'll get him yet.  And Hannah was going out with Grant."

"event","Okay, so I'm in this Basic Shift Management Class, I believe I mentioned it earlier.  Today, we went to observe a restaurant in action, and try to see what went wrong and why.  Here is the tale:

OMG do not eat at the McDonald's at 8 mile road and Lahser.  Unless, of course, dying or getting a foodborne illness is high on your priorities list.  Using expired food and touching uncooked meat with the same gloves as uncooked chicken products and cooked food being the two biggest food safety issues, but there were more.  So many more.  Like going to the bathroom wearing an apron, then going back to work with the same apron on.  I just...damn.  And we <i>had</i> to eat there.  She wouldn't let us leave and go somewhere else for food.  She also wouldn't let me cook my own food :(.  I should have foregone eating, but I was pretty hungry and am not afraid to die or anything.  If I do die, however, someone please sue the hell out of them in my name.  Thank you very much.

I mean, food safety wasn't the only thing about the store that was bad, but customers can't see the horrible food safety issues, as their grills and fryers were behind a wall.  But of the things that did matter, well, the food did taste pretty good, so they had that one thing working for them.  However, the crew members <i>and</i> the managers were rude to customers.  Not only that, but service times were horrendously slow.  Now, the times at my store are pretty bad.  Our average DT time is over a minute over what it should be and our counter times aren't the best.  But these times were far worse.  A group of the people with us got in the counter line, which had about 10 people in it, including the two people in the group.  From the time they got in the line until the first person in this group took her order, it was about 15 minutes.  There was a counter runner, so the counter person only had to worry about taking orders.  How the fuck is it going to take you about 15 minutes just to take the orders of 8 people?  Do you realize that's almost 2 minutes per person?  Do you understand English?  Do you realize you're a fucking manager?  Do you know how much I just wanted to slap you?

Another thing about counter.  So you've got ten people in the store.  That means you have people on these stations, in this order: 1) Counter, 2) Back Cash (DT order taker), 3) Meat person, 4) Initiator (Sandwich maker), 5) DT Presenter (hands out food), 6) Assembler (finishes the sandwiches), 7 ) Fry person, 8) Counter runner (gets orders together for counter customers, hands them out), 9) Initiator, side two (we have two sides of the sandwich making table, so when we get busy, we put someone on the second side, a certain 9th someone), 10) DT runner.  They also had two shift managers (people who aren't supposed to make food, but are supposed to supervise, provide encouragement, and help out only if it gets really busy and service is suffering).  Now, say your fry person has to go to the bathroom.  What do you do?  Do you tell your 10th person to make fries, and act like you only have 9 people for that time?  Do you, as the manager, cover the fry station for a couple of minutes until that person comes back?  Do you have the 10th person make fries while you cover running for DT for that time?  All three of those are acceptable, and I'd do the first, most likely.  We'll play a little game and see what they chose.  You have those three suggestions or you could choose other.  Now, what do you think that they did?  I'll give you some time to think about it.





Go ahead, try to ponder what they did in the situation.





Giving you some more time.





Thought of something yet?





Okay, I'll let you know what they did.




The 8th person went on fries, while the 9th and 10th people stayed where they were.  ""Gee, while this isn't something I would do, it isn't such a problem.  I mean, even though the front counter person has a line nearly to the door at the moment, she's a <i>manager</i> and can surely assemble orders for herself for just a couple of minutes.""  Of course, you can only follow that train of thought when the manager does not take 2 minutes to just take the order and when you actually <i>tell</i> her that her runner isn't there any more.  ""Surely,"" you say, ""any human or possibly any primate would notice that there is a growing line of customers waiting for their food and the person who's been right next to you for the last couple of hours, handing out food is gone.  She would at least look back and see that her runner is not there.  Maybe even ask someone where she went.""  Oh yes, I would most certainly agree with you there.  Anyone as smart as a monkey would do so.  However, you must not have been paying attention to my earlier stories about this front counter person, as she is obviously not as smart as a monkey.  So, of course, you had a couple of orders ready, waiting to be passed out.  Only, two, though.  Not that the grill was slow.  It was slow, sure, but it wasn't that bad.  Only two because she was only able to take three orders in that time.  Meanwhile, our stopwatch is still going, there's an order for three hamburgers sitting on the screen, with 3 hamburgers sitting in the landing zone, just waiting, nay, <i>begging</i> to be bagged and handed out.  And I really would have, honestly.  I mean, sure, it was against procedure, as we were here to see how <i>they</i> did, not to help out.  And I really feel bad making someone wait like that.  But based on the fact that every order handed out was a <b>gamble for life</b>, I wanted the customer to have the worst possible experience.  As much as I like McDonald's, if a store is run like that, I'd much rather the whole company go out of business.  Go to Burger King, lady, whatever, just please don't come back and order any more death burgers.  After a total of 4 1/2 minutes, the counter runner went off fries for a second to assemble the order, finally handing out the customer's food.

When I want customers to go to Burger King, you know there is seriously something wrong here.  So like I said, plz plz plz do not go there.

And you want to know the worst part of it all?  It's a doozy, you'd better be sitting down.  They make $2500 more than us.  On average.  Per day.  I seriously have no idea how, as their service seems too slow to even do $2500 worth of business in one day, let alone that much plus our average.

On the bright side of the class, though, there's this girl who's cute that is attending the class.  Her name's Cassie, and she works at the McDonald's at 31350 Michigan Avenue in Westland, MI.  She's a closer.  She is not, however, cute enough to be worth visiting, as it's an hour away.  However, if you're in the area, and it's night time, you should visit.  On the bright side, she is actually pretty knowledgeable about stuff, and she is quite attractive.  On the negative side, she is also a smoker and she seems pretty snobbish.  She didn't act that way to me, but it seems her personality.  On neither side, she was never a Girl Scout.  Yeah, that's all I've talked to her about.  Well, that and she doesn't listen when she's told to not bring anything, which led to my Girl Scout question.  Well, that, and the second story following:

So we had our break for food during lunch.  The line wasn't long when I got in it, only one person ahead of me (I finished my work first, so the lady was like YOU CAN GO EAT NOW and I was like ""kthx""), so my food didn't take too long to get together.  Naturally, I was greeted in the following way.

*Counter manager finishes taking the order of the person in front of me.*
*I walk up to counter.*
Counter person: ""..."" then looks away.
Me: ""..."" as she's still looking around.
Counter person: Looks at me for a second, then goes staring off again.
Me: Notices she starts looking at me again, quickly starts to order, as I may not be able to hold her attention for long ""Yeah.  I'd like a number two...no cheese...only ketchup.""
CP: ""Wait...what?""
Me: ""A num...ber....two....with....no...cheese....only...ketchup.""
CP: ""So...you didn't want cheese on that?""
Me: ""Correct.""
CP: ""And...just ketchup?""
Me: ""Yes.""
CP: ""So you only want the ketchup on that?""
Me: ""Die.""

Okay, I didn't say that last one.  I really should have, but y'know, I don't do that stuff.  Even to people who are managers and therefore should not be complete idiots.  Okay, here's where Cassie comes in, story 2.

So all the others get finished with their work and come to get food as well.  Cassie must've been right behind my team (we were working in teams, and it was ""my"" work because I was somehow appointed leader of my team), as she got her food somewhat quickly and didn't have to wait 20 minutes like Laura.  Anyway, she comes back and talks sporadically, as more and more people get their food and come to eat.  By sporadically, I mean she just said the conversation following:

Cassie: ""So I was waiting in line, and the lady behind me glares at me and is like 'can't you help them?' and I said 'I don't work here, I'm with a class.'""
Me: ""You should have said: 'Sorry, but we decided to send 12 people on break at once instead.'"" (There were 11 people in the class, I rounded off to a nice even dozen, as I never counted how many people were there at once and didn't know at that time.)
My fellow class members, including Cassie: ""BAHA.""

Okay, my line might not have sounded funny the way it was delivered there, but I cannot recall the exact words, sadly.  I'm too disgusted by that restaurant to have any sort of focus on memory at the moment.  But trust me, it was funny at the time.

And that, my friends, is enough for this entry.  Thank your time."

"event","Have you ever looked in the mirror and not recognized yourself?  It's quite the odd feeling.  The other day, I was looking in the mirror, and I didn't look like myself at all.  It was partially because I was unshaven, but I looked totally different than normal otherwise as well.  Weird, wild stuff.  Then this morning, after shaving, I looked in the mirror and was just like ""who the fuck?""  It wasn't so much what I looked like as the expression on my face, I guess.  It just wasn't a Dan expression at all.  It wasn't any emotion either.  It was just...nothing.

Today, I started my 3-day Basic Shift Management Class.  It's so boring.  I was kinda not looking forward to driving Diyana to it, as she and I have nothing in common and nothing to talk about for the 45 minute trip each way, but it wasn't bad.  Silence is fun, and as long as it's someone I don't dislike a lot, I don't mind.

Today at class, around 11 or so, who knows, one of the teachers was like ""put your thumb and index finger in a circle"" and demonstrated what she wanted to do.  Then she was like ""Now put the circle on your chin"" and put it on her cheek.  I was like ""Yeah...okay, you're a moron, but if that's what you want to call your chin, I'll do it.""  Then she was like ""I said your chin! haha lol"" and thought she had us good.  It was supposed to be a lesson that the crew will do as we do, not as we say.  The only lesson it taught me is that I think most people are morons.

A sux0ring thing, though, is that each class is 9 hours long, but we're only getting paid for 8 hours.  Plus with wear and tear on the car and gas money, it is not proving to be an extremely profitable venture.  Also, Lisa scheduled me for over 40 hours again.  Good work, Lisa.

The main teacher was also using us to try to design new salads for McDonald's.  You'd better pay us if you use our ideas, woman.

That's all for now.  I'm sleepy weepy.  I got like a half an hour of sleep last night.  So...night, folx."

"event","<b>The Fantabulous Exploits of Closing</b>

Today at work was incredibly, incomparably horrible.  From 6-10 PM it was just :(((((((((((((((((((((((.  Thankfully, it did get better after that.  But I came in at 5:48 and there was a line.  I set up my shift and whatnot, then started to walk to the back cause I had to make sure nothing was expired and whatnot.  On my way back, Conyell asks me to make some meat for him, so I do.  So I'm getting him all caught up when Mike walks in and sees the line, still there from earlier.  Around 6, I've dropped enough meat for Conyell and am just about to go up front and help out when Mike's like ""That line needs to be taken care of.""  So it's just like THANKS MIKE, I COULDN'T HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT WITHOUT YOU, MAN.  So I get up there and I'm getting the orders for people who've been there since I walked in fifteen minutes ago.  Very sux.  I was able to get all of the people in there taken care of quickly, but more were flocking in.  And, of course, nothing was stocked.  Lids, bags, toys, boxes, sauces, shake and sundae mix, salads, grill stuff, and on and on.  Surprisingly, ice <i>was</i> stocked, cause the alarm for it being low didn't go off until like 11 PM, so it was quite stocked.  So I was trying to get everything stocked while taking care of the customers who <i>just wouldn't stop coming in</i>.

Now, a little sidenote.  Yes, I do like it when it's busy.  Very much so, in fact.  I do not, however, like when we have nothing stocked, it's horribly unclean, and it's busy.  No no no no no.  If everything was stocked, it would've been a fine and dandy day, at least till around 8:00.

So it's 8:00.  The phone rings.  ""Hi I'd like to place a large order.""
""Okay, go ahead.""
""I'd like 80 McChickens.""
Plz don't be for tonight.  Plz don't be for tomorrow, either.  Plz come Sunday.  ""Okay, for when?""
""9:15.""
""Great!""
""Oh, and how many fries can I get for $20?""
""Well, we have fries on the dollar menu, so you could get 20 for $20 plus tax.""
""Okay, I'll take 20.""
""Great!  Can I get your name and a number where I can reach you?""
*Gets name and number.*
""And you know this is the one at 18 and Dequindre, right?"" I ask, as we had a problem with that on April Fool's Day, so I know of the trouble that can come.
""Yeah.""
""Alright, later my homeboy.""

That last part may not have been factually accurate.

Around 9, I start making the McChickens on side 2.  Dale cannot help, as he's got a bunch of orders on side 1.  So it's up to me to make 80 McChickens.  Joy!  So, as I'm making them, oh, about 30 McChickens in, a baseball team comes into lobby.

Francesca: ""A baseball team's coming in.""
Me: ""Great!  Would they like 80 Big Macs?""

So Dale took care of their orders on side 1 and Francesca and Cindy dealt with them up front.  Cindy was on front DT, but she probably helped Francesca along the way.  So anyway, I finished with the McChickens, came up and made the fries, handed it out, and only got $100 for all my effort.  :(.  After that, we stayed busy in both DT and counter till 10, when lobby closed.  With lobby closed and Francesca staying till 11, I could get Cindy and Dale breaks as well as taking care of some managerial things and stocking and all that good stuff.  Then Frankie left and I had to do front DT for half an hour cause I didn't have that extra person anymore and needed to send Jennifer on break.  It was cool, though, I got some kwality cleaning and stocking done.  After that, it was nice and slow for awhile, and we spent almost the entirety of the next 3 hours cleaning all the mess from the previous 5 (or even more, it was a mess when I came in, who knows when that mess started).  We only made $2 from 12-1.  That was classic.

The rest of the night went fairly well.  I couldn't believe how much Jennifer complimented me on my working, it was crez.  I guess when you only work with Abdul and Conyell, it's pretty bad, but I thought Conyell was a pretty decent worker, usually.  He does take abnormally long breaks and talk on his cell phone and bring in a CD player to work to listen to after close, but I figured he did work when he's not doing all that stuff.  Guess not.  Oh well, apparently they were glad I was there.

So that was my night in a nutshell.  The worst 4 hour time span I've ever experienced at work, which was slightly unpleasant.  Also, I prayed while at work, which is an unusual thing.  Normally, I don't like asking people for help or to do things for me.  That's why I think it's a bit ludicrous to ask God to help you win sporting events or to help with other everyday occurrences like that.  But, well, I was not having a very good day at the time, so I made an exception.  And the night did get quite a bit better after that.  So thanks, God!

<b>Old Arch-Nemesis and...Random Classmate</b>

I'll go in order of my title, cause it sounds better this way, even though they came through drive-thru in the other order.

Devynn Raines.  That's probably how one would spell her name if one were spelling it correctly.  Anyway, she came through DT the other day.  It was weird because there was another classmate that came through earlier and it was like whoa, classmate city.  I have much more personal history with Devynn, though.  The story pretty much takes place in 7th grade, and only 7th grade.  We were in a social studies course together, along with her friend Bridget Pikos and our mutual friend of Paul Lee.  So the four of us sat with each other and talked and stuff.  Devynn was not a very nice lady to me.  See, at the time, I wasn't quite as...outgoing as I am now.  If verbally attacked, I wouldn't jab back with a sarcastic remark or perry with a witty jibe.  I'd respond in kind, which is a little...plebian for my current taste.  Retorts just don't work the same way without that smug sense of superiority.  So she'd insult me on a low level and I'd respond in kind, and that was pretty much how the class went.  I thought Bridget was cute at the time, so I was all ""hey baby, what's your number"" but not really at all.  And Paul and I were friends.  So we got along like that, with Devynn being my arch-nemesis of the moment (I've had quite a few, they're like a rogue's gallery).  She even drew some caricatures of me, some of which were a bit insulting!  So yeah, she came through drive thru and acted like she didn't know me.  Bitch.

Oh, but I kid.  I didn't want to chit chat with her anyway.

And the other drive-thru classmate, earlier in the day, was my old pal Alison Sikora.  And by ""my old pal"", I mean ""some girl who I saw in the hallways a couple times and might've been in some of my classes, but I never said a word to her and she never said one to me.""  So I was about to hand out her food and she recognized me and was all ""Wassup?"" with some crez smile on my face.  I didn't know what to do, so I wet my pants.

That may also have not been factually accurate.

Anyway, I said hi in friendly tone #7 and smiled smile #2.  Very routine.  At the time, of course, I couldn't think of her name.  So I was just like ""LATER"" after I handed out her food.  It took searching through the yearbook to remember her name.  I told Porath about her before I remembered her name, and how she was all crezy smiling and just acting like she knew me or smth.  So I told him my plan was to look her up in the yearbook, find her name, look her up in the student directory, call her, ask her out, and we'd live happily ever after.  I found her name out that night and told Porath the next day at work.  He was all ""If I remember correctly, she was a whore.""  ""All the better!"" says I.  All the better.

For the curious, I have not called her.

<b>Dan Tarasenko, Funny Guy</b>

Some girls came in tonight while I was on counter (Mark left at 7:45 and Francesca didn't get there till 8).  They were all pry 16.  For today, and today only, we have advertising up for the two cheeseburger meal, but it's not in effect yet (that whole thing being the today only, not just the advertising).  So one of the girls (the third one to order, for those keeping score at home) wants to order a two cheeseburger meal, but I explained how it's not in effect till tomorrow.

""Couldn't you just pretend that you have it?""
""Yes, yes I could.  I could also pretend to ring it up, pretend to take your money, and pretend to give you the food.  *mimes all the gestures of doing those things*  Thanks, come again!""

Silly teenage girls.

<b>Running Shift</b>

Tomorrow is a landmark day, folks, be sure to mark it on your calendars.  Romuald will be there, but I will be the one in charge.  A scary thought, I assure you.  And by scary, I mean ""not scary.""  Still, an unusual occurrence.

Also, the other day, Jen was doing the schedule.  She took the manager's schedule, so I couldn't check when I worked.  I asked her when I was working, and she was like ""IDK!"" so I asked her if she at least knew what days I was running shift.

""Oh, you're only running shift two days.""
""That's it?!?  Whoa, crazy!!!""
""But that's because you have BSMC classes for three days.""

So I ""only"" run shift everyday I work.  Yeah, thanks, Jen.  Thanks for getting my hopes up then dashing them.  What a pal!

The ""Current Music"" song is so weird.  You should give it a listen.  I like it."

"event","<b>Austin Flowers and The Tartar Sauce of Doom</b>

So there's this guy at my work named Austin Flowers.  Ha ha funny stuff and whatnot.  Anyway, sometimes he seems to be...not all there.  Here is such a story:

So a lady orders who knows what.  Some EVM, maybe a filet meal, maybe not.  Austin was in front drive-thru.  At Austin's window, the lady asked for some tartar sauce.  Austin, in typical Austin fashion, just DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!  So I was just like ""yeah okay"" and got him some tartar sauce from the grill area.  As I handed it to him, I said ""We'll give it to her now, but tell her that if she wants it next time to ask for it in back cash.""  Austin was just like ""..what?""  So I rephrased it, ""Here is the tartar sauce.  When you give it to her, tell her that next time she comes, she should ask for the tartar sauce in back cash, so she'll get it quicker.""
""But...she's already up here.""
""Right.  So tell her do it next time!""
""But...she's up here.""
""You have no idea how angry you're making me right now.""

At this point, every coworker in the vicinity is cracking up, both because of how stupid Austin is and because I am getting so angry at him.  Also at this point, I gave up on Austin and was just like ""I'll explain later, hand out the sauce already."" so he did after the person had been sitting up at the front window for altogether too long.  After he handed it out, Jennifer explained it to him, ""He wanted you to tell her to ask for tartar sauce at back cash next time so we won't have to waste this time while she's at the front window next time.""
Me: ""AND SO I DON'T HAVE TO WASTE ALL THIS TIME YELLING AT YOU.""
Austin: ""I think I'm starting to get it.""

Another story, from the same day:

<b>Ryan McCabe's Sexual Adventures</b>

Ryan's on break at the time, I'm watching counter.  I'm taking an order and see his girlfriend walk in.  I wasn't sure if she wanted food or just Ryan so I was all ""Can I help you?"" or whatever.  She asked to see Ryan, as expected, so I went to the crew room in the back to get him.

""Yo, Ryan, there's a girl here to see you.  She says she's...carrying your baby?""
""ARE YOU SERIOUS?""

He says that like he's really sleeping around.  That silly Ryan.  What have 16 year olds come to?

Also, in my last entry, I forgot the ending I was going to put with that stuff with my mom and dad.  So basically, with all my allergies and diseases and whatnot, my kids are going to be screwed.  Plus the bad teeth!  Not to mention whatever the wife's gonna carry in her genes.  Good luck with all that, kids!

I pry wanted to talk about other stuff, but I cannot recall anything else of importance.  I'll update as I remember.  Later, my peeps."

"event","For info on our Cedar Point trip, read <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=aviolentrage""><img height=""17"" border=""0"" src=""http://www.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""aviolentrage"" align=""absmiddle"" width=""17""></a><b><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/aviolentrage/"">Joe's</a></b> Livejournal.  I also was disappointed in the trip, being that those two rides were closed the whole day, plus the Power Tower closed when we were <I>so close</i>.  But really, the thing that made the whole trip such a downer was that every roller coaster gave me a headache.  The Gemini wasn't too bad, and the Raptor made me more dizzy than achy, but the Mantis is like torture.  I don't think I'm going to go back for a long, long time.  On the bright side, when I take my kids in however many years, I'll get to ride all the ""old"" rides like the Millennium Force and Raptor with no waiting!  It'll be great.

While at Cedar Point, I got quite sunburnt.  It was a foregone conclusion when I showed up to Cedar Point on a sunny day with no sunscreen, so I'm not surprised.  It doesn't hurt too bad, so it's all good.  I got sunburnt on my scalp though, that was a first.

I was supposed to work 10-6 today.  I started at 10 and didn't have to do changeover, which was nice.  I was only in charge for a few hours, starting at 4, cause Romuald was there.  Here's the breakdown of who will be in charge if they're there.  If Romuald is there, he will always be in charge.  If I'm there and Romuald is not, I will always be in charge.  If Jennifer is there and neither Romuald nor I am there, she will be in charge.  Then Conyell, Abdul, Lisa, and finally Pishia.  Jennifer said that I'm being put in charge so that I get better.  If that were the case, though, why is it that Rom is always in charge when he's there?  No, no, Jennifer, that is not the case.  It's cause Lisa trusts me more than you.  Sry.  Anyway, Abdul was supposed to start at 6, but at like 5:40 he calls in and is like ""I'm going to be 20-30 minutes late.""  So I was like ""YEAH OKAY I'M BUSY LATER"" and went back on my merry way to work.  Of course, I wasn't expecting being in charge at that time, so I had to position the people coming in at 6, but that wasn't overly difficult as Darryl had to leave and we needed help in grill and the people coming in were a grill person and a DT person!  But still, annoying.  Then Abdul shows up at 6:35.  It's not that I mind working late, and I didn't have any plans, but since I can't get overtime, I won't get paid for a bit of the time I was working today, unless I go home a little early tomorrow.  And since I'm of course being in charge, it all depends on how long it takes me to do my deposit.  We shall see!

My dreams were more pleasant last night than they have been recently, which is a plus.  Two of them were sexually related (one of which was me watching a porn, which was...different) and I cannot remember the other at the moment, but it was aight.

In other McD's news, Lisa is now on vacation.  Rom's in charge of the store, and I'm some Romuald now.  Crez.  Also, Porath seems to want to be fired.  Sadly, however, we're still short on people.  Maybe next month, Porath.

News news news.

Also, Rom's trying to hook up with any girl he possibly can.  To try to help him, I'm inviting Dana and Rachel out to see a movie with us on Sunday.  We'll see if either one accepts.  It'll be a little weird if only Dana does.  While she is in fact the hottest girl to ever have worked at McD's and I do have her phone number, she didn't give me her number and pry doesn't know I have it, and I only worked with her like twice 3 years ago and was never really friends with her.  Fun will be had by all, however, I assure you.  Unless it's just me and Frenchie.  Then it'll be all :(.  And on that note, I must leave now and do some inviting.  Cheers."

Yep, that's me.

Today at work sucked mightily.  There was one new person, one person who had never done breakfast before, another who has only worked breakfast a couple hours, and yet another that had to be trained on a new station.  So there were three or four people that actually knew what they were doing during breakfast, and they all needed breaks.  And well...it was not good.  I said it was the worst day ever, but Eric said that that was a couple weeks ago, when Romuald was getting extremely pissed.  The more I thought about it, the more I realized Eric was right, but this time, I was in charge, so it was worse for me.

And later on, I was having Amanda change the towel buckets while Ryan was doing dishes, and two people were taking breaks in the crew room.  I was doing counter at the time, as I had to to get all my breaks out.  I came back from cleaning lobby to get something and Jen was like ""You have two people doing back cash?""
""No, Amanda's doing the towel bucket's and Ryan's on back cash and doing dishes.""
""They're both in the crew room.""

So I went back there and they were just standing there in the crew room, talking to Jowana and Lisa and I was more than a little pissed, especially since there was still a ton of dishes to be washed and I wanted Amanda back on the floor so she could go on counter.  And if I saw them doing that again...well, I would have had to rip their bodies to little tiny pieces.  But after being adequately yelled at, they managed to do their work for the rest of their shifts.  So that was nice."

Whew!  I just used that crazy cut tag for the first time.  I feel warm and tingly.

Last night finally ended the streak of nightmares, it was nice.  The night before that, I had some crazy cracked out dream, I must've been on some good acid when I went to sleep.  And the night before that, I didn't get enough sleep to dream.

Anyway, I dreamt that this coworker of mine, Ryan, got blonde highlights in his hair.  Why I dreamt of him, I have no idea.  He's not really a friend, I don't think about him outside of work, and there's simply no reason that I can think of to dream about him.  Then I came into work today and saw Ryan.  He had blonde highlights in his hair.  He never mentioned getting them to me, and he just got them done yesterday.

I've had weird dreams that later came true, but not so soon after I dreamt them.  They normally took days, or even weeks.  This can only mean one thing: the universe is coming to an end.  Make your time, gentlemen."

I worked today, it was crazeeeeeh.  We made over $1000 more than we normally make, and about $1000 more than we've ever made when I was in charge.  I give it a great.  Porath didn't show up AGAIN!  That crazy Porath, not knowing how to read the schedule.  What will we do with you?

On the bright side, however, is Chris M.  He seems like a good fellow and is a good worker.  He worked at Utica Park with Rom and Lisa, so he knows how to do everything.  He goes to MSU, so we'll only have him till August at the most, but we may only have me till then as well, so it's all good.  A conversation between him and me:
""You look just like a manager that used to work at Utica Park.  Or that still does, I guess.""
""Who?"" I asked, as I know two managers there, one Rom's ex-girlfriend and one his best friend.
""Craig.""  Romuald's best friend!
""WHAT?  No I don't.""
""Well, okay, you don't look like him at all.  But the way you act and your management style are the same.""

That sucked, I wish I did look like Craig.  He's some hottieeeeeee.  Or so I hear.  But he is a cool guy, even if he did marry Krin, so it's cool.

I watched Traffic the other day, on Rom's recommendation...nay, insistence!  And well...it sucked.  It was so incredibly boring and seemingly had no point.  Heck, even American Beauty was slightly more entertaining.  That's <I>just how bad it was</i>.

Yesterday I told Darryl he was enraging me when he looked at me a certain way.  I told him that the more he did it, the higher my rage would build, until I was forced to take a sword and chop him into little pieces.  You know, everyday conversation there.  But then, I come home, and in my brother's old room (my GAME room) I see a <a href=""http://budkww.com/"">Bud K</a> catalogue sitting on top of my bro's mail (he comes by once in awhile to pick it up).  Sadly, Darryl wasn't working today, or I would've had him pick the instrument of his destruction.  Also sadly, the swords are only sold to people 21 and up.  Just a few short months until I can buy a sword.  Yay swords!

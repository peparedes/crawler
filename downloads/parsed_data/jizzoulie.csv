"event","wow havent updated in here in what seems like forever. but im in a crap mood tonite n have no one else to whom i belive would 1) understand me tonite and 2) actually want to listen to me tonite. got home from work and my mom was watching american idol and carrie underwood or w/e was singing god bless the broken road with rascal flatts. which always gets me. i will say this for those of you who do not know me well....i am very emotional over sappy stuff. like when carrie underwood sings god bless the broken road. it made me sad. like im still sad now. and it made me realizes the lonelyness i feel. if you dont want to hear n e more of my whiny bullshit please stop reading now cuz its only going to get worse. ok so continuing because my heart feels really heavy right now. i mean yes its fun to be alone, i guess freedom is what those opptomistic people call it. but it is just that you are alone. u have your friends yes. but they dont provide the cuddles when you watch a movie together, they dont provide tickle fights (well im sure they could but that would be kinda weird), just so many experiences and wonderful moments that i dont have.  i know ill get over this soon, and ill go back to not worrying about it, because in the end i believe that whats meant to be WILL be. i cant change anyones minds about me, i cant force anything to happen, the most i can do is just to be myself. but its hard expecially when you feel just lonely as i do now. so many just i dunno bullshit stuff. like how i sometimes feel like whats wrong with me, is who i am not enough, even though i know it really doesnt matter who doesnt like me wat matters is the people who do, i kno that, its nice in theory yes. but ur actual feelings are not affected by theorys and catchy sayings. they are real feelings. loss gain sadness joy you cant control them they just happen. i think i feel overwhelmed right now. so i am going to make a to do list for myself. and everything doesnt have to happen its just nice to make a to do list and organize all your thoughts and what you feel needs to be done.

to do list:
- study for precalc test tommarow which i bet im going to fail
- get a good amount of sleep tonite
- go to work tommarow
-figure out why they like cut your hours in half!!
- find a guy WORTH getting to fucking know ( oh man i could write a whole book on how there are so many guys i go for that are not even worth my fucking time, all in all im stupid).
- go see monster in law
- have a weekend in sometime
- go to sum concerts this weekend tho
-warm up my hands.


ok thats all for my to do list because well im cold. n plus that list could get really long.

well this whole entry got really long. damn im a fool.
goodnight everyone

"event","ok this is a rant on my mom so if you dont want to hear it then simply dont read it but i am sooo fucking pissed right now




ok so ya kno what. right now i hate my mom. n i dont want to hear shit from any of you about this because none of you live my life and know what i go through and have been through with my mom so i dont want to hear anything negative or anything like oohhh your lucky you have your mom blah blah blah yes i am lucky i have a mom but yet i am unlucky by what my mom does to me. so ill just vent about today because i dont want to dig up anything else right now. i woke up this morning and went downstairs there was breakfast alreayd on the table. 
mom: sit there.
me: ok yay who made breakfast
doug: i did 
me (eating quietly i just woke up so not to much awakeness in me)
doug: could you please chew with your mouth closed
me: i am
doug: could you please not slurp your juice
me: im not
mom: Julie stop fighting with doug
doug: could you please cover your mouth when you cough
me: I FREAKING DID WHAT THE HECK, hey doug would you please go take a shower, hey doug why dont you go cut your nails.  stop freaking attacking me this early in the morning!!!!
doug: shut up your an idiot and you had your hand over your mouth but then you made a disgusting sound
me: what do you want me to say sorry for coughing cuz thats stu.
mom: JULIE DO YOU WANT TO BE GROUNDED
me: for what!!!!
mom: stop fighting with your brother!
me: HE IS STARTING IT!
mom: no hes not you keep talking
me: MOM DO YOU NOT HEAR HIM KEEP TALKING TO ME EVEN THO I DONT SAY ANYTHING TO HIM.
(which sidenote i didnt by the time he said that thing about me coughin i had walked up to the bathroom and was straightening my hair.)
mom: ya know julie your just ruining everyones morning
me: whatever *slammed door*

 then she comes home like around 9ish and hasnt really said n e thing to me cuz ive been at work and when i got home she wasnt here so she hasnt said like anything ot me all day

mom: wheres my pin
me: in my car but im typing up a big project
mom: go get it
me: but im doing this project first
mom: it will just take a minute
me: wait a little bit
mom: no go get it now or do you want to get off the computer for the rest of the night
me: fine whatever. (so i go and get it and bring it in and toss it on the table)
mom: dont you dare throw that around like that
me: i didnt, whatever mom
mom: dont you dare talk to me like that you want me to turn off that computer
me: but im typing up something for school
mom: i dont care i will
me: obviously you dont
mom: YOUR GROUNDED YOUNG LADY DONT MAKE PLANS TO DO ANYTHING TOMMAROW NIGHT!
me: for what!
mom: your attitude
me: I DONT HAVE AN ATTITUDE MOM
mom: yes you do!
me: where are you going
mom: out, 
me: to party ? 
mom: as a matter of fact yes, not like its any of your business.
me: whatever
mom: keep it up young lady and youll be grounded this whole week.
 
yeah thats all thats been said between me and my mom. nothing else. how grand aint it. shes a swell bitch!!!! i am so fucking pissed off with her! she has 3 kids all under the age of 18 and shes going out at 930 at night and partying? yeah w/e  sehs gunna come home all drunk around 1 in the morning. i swear shes more of a fucking teenager then i am. yet she tries to control every aspect of my life while not letting me in on a fucking clue on hers! and i mean sometimes its nice, but seriously shes more of a teenager then i am. shes goes out every weekend with her friends, and whenever the kids aint here, she goes out all night and comes back the next morning. last sat. for example i woke up to her gone. and came home the night before with no one home. i mean yes ups, but i dont think any of you understand the downs to this. i dunno i could tell you all a story of a  new years eve i will never forget but i dont want you all to judge my mom because she is a good person and she can be nice and what not and a great mom. its just GRRR.........she wants to be young again while growing older and being a single mom to 3  kids, 2 of which are still that...kids.  just oh man. ok well this is enough venting for right now... im just scared for the cruise because i know its going to be even worse then this, its going to be her partying and us kids fending for ourselves. oh well ima have a lot of fun.....hopefully.....and hopefully michelle comes and not gay ass jim! geez cant stand that man! but yeah im outtie yo OH MAN ITS 1010.  make a wish. well ima go get ready for bed because i am feeling tired and drained! saturday is shannons birthday party tho yay im excited for that! ok well piece out homies

"event","so im sad. and crying and upset. because a silly tv show. call me romantic call me a fool w/e i was blubbering like a baby tonite because of one show i call...one tree hill.....im just so upset with the whole nathan and hallie situation . just i dunno i like to think im a romantic at heart and this situation just tears me apart. i think haley is being soo stupid seriously. the way i see it is, you get one love of your life..thats it..and once you meet them nothing else matters because you have them to help you through everything...your career will change, why would you run off to do a tour that could end in a day and ruin the love of your life forever? if you love music, teach it to others, theres so many other things you can do with that love, stay and play local shops, be with the one you love because in the end thats all that matters was who you loved and how you loved them. it was one of the dumbest things i think she has done ever yet so far. and to not come or call or anything is another dumb move. and another thing i was thinking that made small tears come out opposed to the huge emo ones that were falling while the show was going was, it will be awesome when i can find that guy who will watch my tuesdsay shows with me, but when i cry and blubber like i did tonite will he make fun of me and tell me its not real and doesnt matter because its a show, because i dont want that. i want him to kiss my tears away and hug me and show me that it doesnt matter because what really matters is the love we have for each other right now and not to pay attention because if things were meant to be then it will happen and love will find its way. and thats what i want in a man. i mean theres other things. but thats a big one, i want the one who kiss's and hug's and comforts me, i am an overlysensitive person and i dont want someone who doesnt appreciate that i want someone who instead of making fun of that imbraces it and loves it. gosh im too romantic. wow this took a real unexpected turn and i dunno, im crying and sad and trying to right a journal on how a stupid show affected me so it may end up in the end a little off topic but i like it. maybe someday when im old and have found that love of my life and were getting old together ill say here i made a journal about  you when i was only 16 and i already knew i wanted you. and ill show him cuz this stuff on the internet i think lasts forever and if it doesnt oh well. it will remind me of what i want but im off to do french....

<h2>Your Sexual Flavor Is Vanilla</h2>
Sweet, simple, uncomplicated

You go with the flow, and go well with any lover.
You're not a prudish lover but an adaptable one.
A blank canvas, you're willing to be painted with any kink.
As long as it's washed down with some sweet whipped cream.

"event","Oh man i am a silly kid. i forgot to add this from yesterday. it made me laugh soo hard lol. see none of you except speech and debaters get the pleasure of hearing ""joey quotes"" real early on sat. mornings so here is one of the funniest ones from yesterday.

""i would be really upset if i couldnt get my balls through the hole."" lol hahahhahaha it sounds really perverse and what  not but its not at all lol but me n kathy just looked at each other when he said it and started laughing so hard. priceless. the mornings with them, and the things they say.....priceless. im so happy that i am a part of speech and debate, not because of the competition and the skills i am getting on my public speaking (which are a all together fundamental part of y i like it) but the people that i probably wouldnt have talked to that much if it wasnt for speech and debate is what has really made me so happy with it. 

lol oh yeah today me n sam went together to church, and she was really looking forward to seeing her boo, but i was hoping he would come to the one we were going too....and we sat right in front of him...GO SAMSTERS! WOOT WOTO oh yeah we also got free donuts! this fat kid is satisfied...

hey girl:

Hey girl, you've got a smart way about you
That makes me
Wish that I was smart enough for you

Hey girl, you've got a fine laugh
And I think that I
Could get used to that
And you're already used to laughing at
Me

So what if your friends think I'm crazy?
Well, I wasn't trying to impress those girls anyway
They're all theory, no action
And where I'm from
We live like it's the latest attraction

Hey girl, you've got a short fuse
And I've got designs on lighting you up
And setting you off
And watching you burn for me

The world lives for the weekend
Well, I'll watch as my weeks bleed right into them
Without a line 
To divide
What is their's 
And what is
Mine

So what if your friends think I'm crazy?
Well, I wasn't trying to impress those girls anyway
They're all theory, no action
And where I'm from
We live like it's the latest attraction

Go on, go on
Your cruel intentions won't 
Solve your problems
Everyone's gotta get
Bottom
Bottomed out in the long run
And those are the times you need love (x3)

~ yay! nicole martin is really nice. like i saw a lot of people talking about her in their journals and then i talked to her ONCE during the day at school and we were reminiscing of our english days together, and then a few days later she leaves me one heck of a nice comment on my journal. so nicole you rock!!

"event","feels like a while since ive wrote in here. ya know what i was just wondering.....how many people actually read this? like i figure u kno my friends that i know do, but like i wonder how many of you read it that dont even tell me. i like it when people tell me they read my journal. it makes me feel somewhat cool i guess like i actually have a life worth reading about. lol i dunno i just wonder. but ok wow done with that......
but guess what everyone!!!
1) my cars in the shop till tuesday getting fixed...woot woot it really needs it too...but bad news...first its gunna cost 400 which i dont have! so that sucks and then two i forgot my book bag and books in the car but my moms letting me stay home like in the morning tommarow till i get it so thats cool i guess...but (dont make fun of me) i kinda actually wanted to go to school! 
2) i cleaned my basement! me ! all by myself! and my mom bought me flowers! and we have watermelon at my house! and watermelon reminds me of grams! and i miss grams soo much! so i love watermelon !! and it reminds me of florida! where i will be in less then 2 months HELL YES BITCHES! woot woot

but ok on sadder note yo...
my dad is a HUGE asshole. like humongously huge! fucking idiot! but ok heres why:
1) he told me when i went snowplowing with him he would get me this jeep thing if the ppl gave it to him and it would be my car instead o my piece of crap.. and that hes gunna try n get it by doing work for the ppl. and so he showed up friday to our house in it and i asked him wat was going on whereas this is the response i got, "" im keeping it, its mine. im using it for my business (not like youve got a truck and a huge ass van, which your trying to sell cuz u dont need it, and your the only fucking worker of your damn ""company"" so you dont really need it asshole) im gunna do work for the people and they gave me this, and im keeping it, its mine"" yeah well your a fucking liar...like you would buy me a car for my 16th birthday...or how you would let me bring oreo over? never did...yea you promise soo much shit and never EVER keep it! EVER. yeah thanks asshole. and your not even helping mom pay the $400 dollars it takes to get my car fixed! when 1) shes a single mother with 3 kids and you do didlly squat for us and 2) her car needs like $500 worth of fixing and shes not even getting her car fixed and heres another reason why hes an asshole
2) hes ok with karen putting in a transfer to go to virginia. 1) her familys all here, here mom and dad lives like 2 houses down from her, and her whole family lives here. 2) my dads family lives here...everysingle one of em. live in cleveland. yeah and 3) his fucking kids are here! now seriously YOU PUT IN THE TRANSFER! what the hell!!!! im so fucking pissed about this! i dont know what to think of it, is this your trying to pull my dad away from us?? because 1) thats low and i didnt think you would ever do that and 2) what kind of women would pull a father away from his kids and 3) WHY THE HELL WOULD HE GO ALONG WITH IT! obviously were not shit in his life. oh and heres what he told my sister that we could go spend the summer with them FUCK YOU IF YOU MOVE IM NOT MOVING MY FUCKIGN ASS  OUTTA CLEVELAND TO GO FUCKING SEE YOU! so ya know what i hope you do... i leave for college in less then 2 years, youve got less then 2 years to spend what little time we already spend together..together...and your gunna move to virginia?? ok im not giving up my time and friends to go visit you just cuz its conveinent to you. im telling you this dad if you move..that will be the end of even the smallest relationship you have with your kids. i wont talk to you on the phone. i dont understand it! why the hell would you do this oh and karens response for putting it in, ""well theres 2 reasons...1) it would be better for dalton to live in the warm weather..."" yeah she didnt even say the 2nd reason. WELL YA KNOW HES GOING TO NEED TO KNOW HOW TO LIVE IN THE COLD WEATHER TOO AND HELL HE LOVES PLAYING IN THE SNOW! whatever tho i dont care.... im so fed up with him....weekly dinners...over.....visiting on sundays...over...dont expect to see me for a long time till i cool down, or you move, w/e. im done


in other news...me n my mom spent a lot of time together today..that was nice... then went with natalie to look at dresses for hta cocktail dance thing and i have this dress from 2 years ago n its reall hot n i think ima wear that n then krych came over n i showed her it n she really likes it a lot i guess. and i guess me n her are gunna go together so thats cool i guess. and im supposed to go see coach carter with  ta shannon n natalie so thatll be sweet i cant wait! but ok im off to bed just had to vent...oh wait another thought

i want a guy. im not sure even if its a wanting of a boyfriend i just want someone to cuddle with and watch tuesday shows with and to wrestle with and to go to the duck pond and walk aroudn with. ... ok im done being depressed on that situation...

speaking of scary me noie n steve are supposed to go see either hide and seek, boogeyman, or white noise. haha we wanna see em all but who knows im excited for that lol haha i love scary movies even tho i get real scared lol. ooh yeah ok so saw this on shannons journal and ima give a shout out to all of you that have impacted my life in some way n if i forgot you im sorry i forget a lot of things, its not that your not important, i just forget thingys. ok so here goes

shannon- i am so happy that we both did soccer sophmore year. the only good thing that came out of it was having you as a friend. i am so happy we became friends and you have this ability to always make me laugh, and anyone else your around. but i know thats not all there is to you. you are one awesome girl and we have had soo many fun times together. you make me see sometimes i do step outta line with my actions and im just so happy we have stayed friends for this long and i hope we stay friends for a long time to come because losing a friend like you would be one of the hardest things i would have to do.

Another Statistic

I dont want to be another statistic
some suicidal teen
who makes a choice to kill herself
when the world just seems too mean.
she cant go on with life
or so to her it seems
reality has fallen short
and so have her many dreams

i dont want to be another statistic
some pregnant little girl 
who met this great guy 
and then gave sex a whirl
she was only fifteen
but it felt so right
she thought theyd be together 
for more than just a night.

I dont want to be another statistic
some kid strung out on crack
who started at a party
and now he cant turn back
first cigarettes and alcohol
now meth, crack, and cocaine
he's been smoking it so long
that now hes gone insane

i dont want to be another statistic
some girl left out in the rain
who was walking home from school
then raped and left in pain
she cant tell her  parents
and it hurts to tell her friends
she doesnt know what shell do 
to make this nightmare end.

i dont want to be another statistic
some kid out of school
who dropped out really early
and was acting like a fool
he thought that it was boring
he thought that it was dumb
he doesnt have an education
but lives on the streets like a bum.

i dont want to be another statistic 
some stereotypical teen 
im gonna make a difference
ill finish with my dream
i wont end up pregnant 
on drugs or even dead
i wont drop out of school
because ill use my head.

i dont want to be another statistic
to fit into some mold
of what society thinks of kids today
because its getting kind of old
not all of us are bad
in fact most of us are good
when will the world see us
and give us credit like they should?

alright im going to bed. i love that poem. nighty night yo!.

"event","wow seems like a long time since ive written in here. i would find myself contemplating whether or not i would continue this. dont ask me why. weird mood lately.

ok ill start off w/ friday when we got outta school because n e thing during the week that happens is insignificant. oh wait there was one funny thing that happened during the week. ill get to it later tho.

friday: got outta school. came home and cleaned like crazy so i could go out later that night. so talked to melissa she picked me up around 7ish we got joey, natalie, and krista. then went to the lodge. it was sweet. so much fun. thats all ill say i had a lot of fun met new ppl and just basically enjoyed myself. left there around like 1140. n we almost got hit by a drunk driver on the way home! the guy kept swerving over into melissas car. not very pleasent. but yeah got home around 1235 and went straight to bed.

saturday: woke up around 542 and got ready for speech and debate tournament. was dreading it for so long. so get to school and we sit around till about 830 when finally we are told what to do and our like first rounds begin and so on and so on. welll.....I GOT A MEDAL! I CAME IN 6TH PLACE. HELL YES! omg i was sooo excited. the medals up in my room right now. i love it . its an actual medal and engraved on the back. my scores were 4,2,4,2 not bad at all coming from like 6,6,5,6. yeah so im real happy about that. came home found out we werent going to in good company. so went to dinner w/ my mom n aunt n rented wimbledon and garden state, and watched those n slept n rested. both werent bad didnt care to much for garden state, dont really recomend it to anyone so yeah. but then went to beddy bye bye.

sunday: went to church. tried to study all day. was supposed to go see in good company today but b/c of the snow we decided not too. so i was online around like 530 and ashley young imed me and asked me if i wanted to go to a concert at the grog shop and i was like heck yeah i love concerts! so the thing was at 7 and we didnt find anyone to take us til like 710 lol but we still went. haha it was fun i liked it a lot almost got killed like 5 times on the way there tho. omg so scary but real fun the ppl who were playing were  Ruet Caelum / Morning After / Cora Adlai / Left Field  it was only $8 and very good. sooo many hot guys. but yeah good music too i got a free cd. which i left in the kid johns car but ashleys bringing it for me on tuesday hopefully at least. and then got taco bell and came home n yeah slept lol. but i had a lot of fun. and i cant wait till hh comes to town. i love them soo much. and even if i have to go by myself ill go. but im pretty sure me n noie are going together and i think mike said he wants to go so it will prolly be us 3 cuz buddy doesnt want us to come w/ him. even tho hes the only person i ever go to hh w/ and he knows there my fav. band ever. but w/e apparently hes too cool. i dont care im going even if i have to bymyself. i love them. i was looking at pictures of em today lol in concert. gosh i cant wait till march 3rd. but ok

monday: woke up real late. went w/ me madre to dicks and fashion bug and mcdonalds. got some new green like silvery shorts there sweet im wearing em tonite.then came home and got vocab words down. hecks yeah. then later tonite is soccer game. at dome. at 8. all should come itll be sweet. actually no its gunna b freazing that place doesnt have like heat. well it does just not very good heat. so bring scarves and stuff!! lol  but yeah bored. and just numb  lately. finals are tommarow and all that good stuff. i need to find me a job. haha yeah but i want to say so much...but cant. oh well. life sucks. it really does. actually i dont think its life. its all of you in my life. not all of you. just a lot of you. hmm ever think about how much simplier life would be if you were a hermit with no friends. that way when you feel like (hmm wats the ""right"" word) isolated by them you will realize that u have none and it doesnt matter anyways. hmm natures beautiful, familys beatiful, people can be beautiful, but a lot of times they are not. i dont know why, we all have that ability to be humans who do the best we can when we can and be nice and accepting.....but we dont...i dont know why. and im not saying its everyone but me. because i know its me too, i dont accept people right away, i try to. but i know i dont.  im not perfect no one is. dont try to be its our imperfections who make us who we are. but the imperfections that hurt others are the damaging ones that we should try to fix. or at least gain control of. no one should ever tell you to fix your imperfections because that is who you are and if they  have a problem with who you are or how you act, and it doesnt harm anybody but yourself, and maybe it doesnt even harm yourself, people just have a way of thinking they know whats best for you...but they dont. and this subject pisses me off soo much. dont fucking tell me what to do, i dont need to hear it, i am me. me is just fine for right now. i dont harm you, i dont hurt you, so why do you feel the need to hurt me and criticize my every moment. i dont care what you think. stop worrying about me and start with your own problems that need some fixing. as my dad says, ""just worry about yourself for right now"" ok wow that took an unexpected turn. didnt mean for it to get there. but yeah it came out oh well. heres a poem i will leave you all with. i love it so much and often read it sometimes before i go to bed. it can be found in chicken soup for the teenage soul on tough stuff its on page 7. and just amazing as is the storys and other poems in this book but this one is expecially meaningful to me. 

Have you ever

Have you ever lived my life? 
Spent one minute in my shoes?
If you haven't then tell me why
You judge me as you do.

Have you ever woken up in the morning 
Wondering if this was your last day on Earth?
Have you ever left your house 
Unsure if you'd return?

Have you ever seen your friend get shot
Outside his favorite store?
Have you ever seen a friend die
From drugs he'd never used before?

Have you ever seen your mom get beat up
By your stepdad messed up on booze?
Have you ever had an unwanted pregnancy 
Forcing you to choose?

Have you ever sat beneath the stars
Hoping God will hear?
Have you ever seen your friend drive away
After too many beers?

Have you ever had a friend
Experiment with weed?
Have you ever covered up guilt
by doing a good deed?

Have you ever considered suicide
As the only way?
Have you ever tried to hide yourself
Behind the things you say?

Have you ever wanted to protect
Your friends and everyone in sight?
Have you ever felt such pain
That you cried yourself to sleep at night?

Have you ever lived my life,
Spent one minute in my shoes?
If you haven't, then tell me why 
You judge me as you do....

"event","ok so heres some more dashboard confessional lyrics...and man i love them...ive had dashboard confessional in my head all day. 

Carve your heart out yourself- dashboard confessional

Carve your heart out yourself 
Hopelessness is your cell 
Since you've drawn out these lines 
Are you protected from trying times? 

Man it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has 
Lord it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all 
Oh look now, there you go with hope again 
Oh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the end 

Dig a ditch deep enough 
To keep you clear of the sun 
You've been burned more than once 
You don't think much of trust 

Man it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has 
Lord it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all 
Oh look now, there you go with hope again 
But I'll be sure your secret is safe with me 
Oh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the end 
Treating me like I'm already gone

But I'm not, I will stay where you are always 
I will stay, I will stay, I will stay (all of now) 
[repeat to fade out]


so yeah that line about it takes a lonely girl to wish she had never dreamt at all just really hits me. tonite ive been realizing many things. hmm i dont know if i will continue expecially in this live journal. where anyone will read it. and take it to mean themselves. and im just saying out of the people who always think my journals about them its not. dont worry yourself with this.  lately ive felt left behind. but ive realized that oh well. life moves on and i will not worry about it. you can decide from now out. ive done everything i can to not feel left behind. but i cant help what you do. im sure were still going to be friends just i dont think it can or will be how it used to. but then deep down i think it will later on when your not so preoccupied. just right now you have other things going on and its ok. ive realized im not losing you just kinda losing what we used to have. maybe with time it will come back. but as of right now im pretty sure its gone. 
ok now dont think this is towards any of you. believe me of the people who usually think my journals are bout them, this is def. not about you. and please do not ask me about this because i really dont feel like explaining this to any of you because i still am kind of torn up on this subject. but oh well im probably just exagerating because its late and im tired. so i will go to bed now. but i really really really really needed to get that out. maybe it will give me hope when i fear i have lost you. maybe i just needed to get it out. im not sure but it has been bothering my conscience. so its out. goodnight all.

"event","ok so these lyrics soooo totally desecribe what i have been thinking lately.

As Lovers Go

She said, ""I've got to be honest, you're wasting your time if you're fishing around here.""

And I said, ""You must be mistaken, I'm not foolin this feelin is real.""

She said, ""You've gotta be crazy! What do you take me for? Some kind of easy mark?""

""No you've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion, but i swear that you've got me all wrong."" I'll be true, I'll be useful, I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear, I'll belong to you if you just let me through.

This is easy as lovers go. So don't complicate it by hesitating. This is wonderful as loving goes. This is tailor-made, whats the sense in waiting?

I said, ""I've got to be honest, I've been waiting for you all my life.""  For so long i thought i was asylum bound, but just seeing you makes me think twice. And being with you here makes me sane. I fear i'll go crazy if you leave my side. 

""You've got wits, You've got looks, You've got passion, but are you brave enough to leave with me tonite?""


ok so thats one song by dashboard confessional i really really like and like kinda can associate too. and then i love this one too. i was singing it yesterday at the top of my lungs and have been waiting for it alll today to come on.  
 
Kelly Clarkson- Since you been gone.

Here's the thing
We started out friends
It was cool, it was all pretend 
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone
You dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long, till I called you mine
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone
And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I'd picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get, what I want
Since you been gone

How can I put it, you put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone
How come I'd never hear you say
I just wanna be with you
Guess you never felt that way

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get, what I want
Since you been gone

You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again, and again and again 

Since you been gone, (since you been gone) 
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get, I get what I want
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
You should know that I get
I get what I want

Since you been gone

Since you been gone

ok so yeah i have been loving those songs lately. they rock. today i was supposed to go to speech adn debate and i woke up and it was horrible out so i called weaver to make sure we had it, cuz i was scared to drive outside in it. i woke up around 630 and by teh time she called me back around 735 my street still hadnt been plowed and neither did holland a main road in brookpark so i told her how i was scared to drive and how i almost got in an accident the other day and she said if i decided to stay home thats totally fine cuz she would rather have me be safe then risk it to go out. so i decided to stay home cuz i was really scared specially  after the other day almost hitting that person and it wasnt even this bad. so i felt really bad specially cuz i was actually like ready. i was like physically ready to go like dressed and everythign even straigthned my hair somethin i never do for speech tournys. and like i was up till 1230 last nite practicing just saying it and resaying my speech over and over and like i know it pretty much by heart and inserting the right gestures and new suit. and then i get too freaking scared to drive out..... man oh well. but yeah tonites nappy dyno night at dizzos hizzo!! woot woot! i told her to invite da hottie lol ahhaha... but yeah im out piece needy u kno wats lol. hahah.

"event","oh wait i have none.just kidding. but not really. well i have my friends but i just have felt that im losing touch with some of you. mostly my bestest buddy! where the hell have you been all break. or where the hell have i been when youve been on. i dunno i think me n buddy are losing our bond. its just like i havent talked to him or hung out with him in what seems like forever. i dont think he even reads this anymore. which is sad because before he would comment on like every entry. n now....nothing. oh well i guess this is me being phased out.which is sad. hes a pimp. ima loser. lol. but yeah basically all ive done this week is see a lot of movies. took my mom to see closer the day after christmas. then up the next day i think i saw leminy snickets with shannon and lainey then last night i saw darkness with noie,that was fun havent hung out with noie in a while over break, and then the other night i saw hmm lemme think first oh yeah i also saw oceans twelve the other night alone. but yeah im movied out. i wanna go to the mall and spend the hard earned cash i made this week...but my car insurance came in the mail this week so i will have like 15 bucks left to spend. sucks.anyone wanna go to the mall soon with me. cuz thats about all there is left to do in this freaking stupid town. OMG I JUST GOT AN AWESOME IDEA. anyone wanna go find a chuckie cheeses with me and go to it cuz i wanna playt hat game were u throw the ball in the hole lol. hahah that was my stupid idea of the day. but yeah people please leave me some comments. ohh one last thought on my mind. 

im scared for my cousin. i know the chances are very slim of getting killed when going to iraq. but still. he could get killed. hes leaving january llth i think to stay a year in iraq. i dont want him to die. im really close with my two cousins. i used to be very very close with my cousin mike. we would have sleep overs and stuff. and just play a bunch of little kids games and just talk and hang out and that was fun. and play k-nex. ok enuf of that lol n then he joined the marines and got married and moved away. so i really didnt see him that much. and my other cousin bryan like we always played with him and i was kinda close but not much then like mike moved away and bryan became the fun one to stay by at holiday get togethers.  n now hes going to iraq. and mikes away in north carolina with rachelle. and bryans gunna b gone. n ima miss both of them so much. like ive got over missing mike, n when i see him from time to time its nice but i know that hes not gunna be there next time we get together. its just gunna be weird w/out bryan there. but yeah scared for him. hope everything goes ok. and that is why i am hangin with the family on new years eve. because it will be the last time i will get to see my cousin. i asked him on christmas when is the next time we get to see him before he leaves and he said new years eve and probably not anytime after that. so yeah im gunna go hang out with them.  but wow yeah nothing else really on my mind. except of the fact that i am infact a HUGE loser. lol im probably not but just like to think of that.

"event","well its been a while since ive wrote in this....for me at least lol.
ok well darcys sleepover was a lot of fun. got a few hours of sleep in. hahah i think i was going crazy for most of the night. lol haha i fell off the couch. n joel snell is really hott. but i had like a coffee and i dunno but i was like going crazy for the rest of the night and then my car staled out so that was bad. but yea then the only next thing that really matters was christmas eve mass and omg there was this really hott guy there. i used to go to school with his younger brother joe. and this kid is im guessing 2 years older. but he was gorgeous. i was happy to have some eye candy in that long mass. but yeah gorgeous. then christmas got a lot. the best stuff was from my mom. she got me all i asked for. the main gift from my dad was.....suit sets. yep thats right i got a suit and  a pair of suit pants. awesome?? no he got my sister an  electrized scooter and my brother this big drill saw flashlight set which was an expensive item. then i get a suit? oh well ya gotta love dads. but hey im thankful. it'll come in handy at speech and debate...even thought im thinking of quitting right. oh well who cares im blessed i even got something so screw my selfishness. then today went n got the mat for the ddr i got for christmas and got 2 wireless ones, but the one is defective so we have to take it back but we still have one mat so we were playing on that. and then i took my mom to see closer. and that was pretty good. weird to see with your mom though cuz its basically a movie about sex, and love, and getting screwed over by everyone else because everyone cheats on each other. and the ending sucked i didnt like it. the concept of the whole movie is really good, and i liked it but i just dont like how it ended but the ending suited i guess. i just didnt like it. but yeah . i gotta be at my dads house by 745 cuz im babysitting from 8 to 6 tommarow then hopefully goin to see leminy snickets but not sure yet. but if u wanna talk to me at all tommarow. just give the celly a ring. i got it turned back on. the numbers 216-374-0422.  but yeah my breaks actually been pretty laid back and i kinda like it like this. oh i got 3 new cd's today. cost me 32 bucks n sumthing cents but it was worth it. i got dashboard confessional-a mark, a mission, a brand, a scar.  rock against bush vol. 1. and fat music volume 4-life in the fat lane. haha that suits me. i like life in the fat lane cuz it has good music and was only 4 buckaroo's. ima cheap skate ive noticed. lol haha man i feel alone in the world and i kinda like it but get lonely. i got a collata ring yesterday and its glittering on my pinkie (cuz my ring finger is to fat for it) and i like it there and it makes me happy. and yet i want to cry. you all wanna know a secret...my christmas wish was to find a guy that i like that actually likes me back...hmm didnt come true...im sure a lot of you feel me on this...love sucks. and i havent even experienced yet and it already sucks.no hope. lol haha. ok well im out like a fat kid in dodgeball (Which reminds me i got dodgeball woot woot) but outtie piece

"event","just wanted to put these lyrics in. i dont know if there going to affect any of you. but they affect me a lot. i just sit and think about these lyrics, and sing along cuz its an awesome tune.

~~Hope, by twista f/ faith evans


Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately.
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah,
Rest in peace to Left Eye,
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay,
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers,
And everybody lost period.
All we got is HOPE!!

[VERSE 1 (Twista)]
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks,
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail,
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick,
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer,
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in a zone,
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly,
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them high, And I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh
We will never break, don't underestimate, we shall motivate,
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day,
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.
Sit at the light so long,
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong,
So when right go wrong,
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on!!!
Let's HOPE!

[CHORUS (Cee-Lo)]
Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
Let's be hopeful!

[VERSE 2 (Twista)]
I wish that you could show some love,
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing,
Watch the music and have 'em trippin off the joy I bring, (shiit)
I wish that we could hold hands,
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders,
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat,
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stain' strong,
You can make it whether you wit him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And the po po bring the heat on them priest like they did R. Kelly, And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (sh**) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish that enemies could talk,
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game,
Let's HOPE

[CHORUS (Cee-Lo)]
Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
Let's be hopeful!

[VERSE 3 (Twista)]
Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic,
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it,
We can make it always so optimistic,
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it,
I pray for justice when we go to court,
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war,
Why can't we kick it and just get em on,
And in the famous words of Mr. King ""Why can't we all just get along"",
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze,
And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies,
You can be wrong if it's you doubting,
With the faith of a must to see drinkin moon mountains,
And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt,
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!
And let?s HOPE

[CHORUS (Cee-Lo) X2]
Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
Let's be hopeful!


ok i dont know if any of you could understand that, but i do. and it means a lot to me. basically to me its saying. i know all this bad stuff has happened, and if it could i wish it wouldnt have happened. but it has. so lets be hopeful for what we still have today. and keep on truckign basically. just beautiful. im excited for tonite. darcys havin another sleep over, adn with all the snow we havin a snow billy fight lol. but yeah that song just came on and after singing it at the top of my lungs i thought i would share my inspiration with you all. so yeah hopefully it helps out some of you if u need it. but marry christmas all. have a good holiday."

~why do somepeople say they are like your best friends and then somehow you never see them or hang out with them. what happens? 
~ when you are religius and dont really agree with the preachings but believe the idealogy, like im catholic and believe that jesus came to earth and saved our sins and raised up to heaven n was nailed to cross n blah blah blahj but i dont agree w/ the teachings like gays are bad, no abortion, that kinda stuff. 
 
ok i think thats all. i have a few more, but it would be soo stupid to ask them on here. lol hahah ok im done night all."

"event","hey hoes n bitches. haha switched it up on ya. im sooo dead tired like not even funny so this journal not gunna make much sense cuz my brain isnt put togetha but basically today composed of this

~woke up at 6 to go to speech n debate (which i really did not feel like going to) and get there by 645 n go to the school to find out were like an hour early. so i was like argghhhh. i coulda slept more. lol hahah my scores were better then usual. 4-5-5-5. hahahah. but yeah came home took a shower, thought we was gun go see leminey snickets but even betterly we went to laine dogg's. n we gun see leminey snickets over break. that was crazy times. at first i was going crazy cuz i was sooo tired i was at that hyper point. n just laughing at everything. but then i just sunk and become unbarabely tired. lol horribly. but yeah n came home n thats where im at now! 

hahah turned in my article last nite on why i am sweeter then shannon. n its gunna b awesome cant wait to see it in the zine. even tho shan-hoe thinks shes better. shes not.

also one last turn of thoughts going thru my head. -------------------->
i have no where i belong :( i dont have a niche :( everytime i get someplace that feels like a home it disappears. :( n i dont want to hear n e comments to this because thats bullshit none of you know my life situations or story. u dont know shit so dont say shit. im getting this out because i want to and it has been bothering me. so if u dont like what you have seen so far. dont continue to read its that simple.
i hate it at my house. i hate it. i can not stand jim. its not just how him and my mothers relationship is, its the whole package. everything about this man just irks me. i dont know how to explain it. and i try not to hate him because god doesnt want that and i want to go to heaven. its just....i hate the man. so i spend whatever i can with my dad. but hes the biggest jackass of all time. this is a phone call between me n him that happened the other day. me-""dad heres a deal. moms gunna pay the 70 for my indoor if you pay the 60 for my speech and debate"" dad-"" i dont have time for this fucking shit i just got done working and im to fucking tired for this i just fucking worked all day. ill call you back later bye."" hang up. thanks dad. oh also thanks for calling me back....not. hes such a fucking jerk and i can not stand the man. but hes better then this house. but then i go over there and i know im not at home there. its nice to go over there and sometimes wish i was part of it. because when hes with karen and dalton he cares for them...but i just dont feel the same love he has for them, for me. and i dont have a family with my mom...i have a situation.  i swear if it wasnt for the fact that i have no where else to go that would allow me to go to berea, i would move in a heartbeat. i am always placed 5th in this fucking family. behind everyone. because i dont approve of jim, im not even included in family functions. and it hurts, because deep down inside i feel like i have no family. and specially around christmas. god i hate feeling empty. and this is what i have been feeling lately. empty. i have had no love, real joy, real happiness, real togetherness etc. in me for a long time now. i dont know where it went. i think this is enough for tonite tho cuz ive already started gettin teary. soo much other stuff i could explain about why i feel and do the things i do......but then again.....its just to hard. and we being human beings always give up when something is to hard. which i will do now, and just feed the cliche. night all. i told you this wasnt going to make sense im to tired to make sense.

"event","so tonite is friday night and i have decided to stay home and get sum much needed resting time in. i have to get up at 6 tommarow n be at the school by 645 for a speech n debate thing that i dont really want to go to. and then im pretty sure me n shan-hoe is going to see leminey snickets. which is exciting cuz ive really wanted to see it. lol omg so many movies out that i have wanted to see just 1- no time 2-no money. i need a damn job. maybe ill put in mcdonalds and arbys applications tonite cuz lord knows ive applied everywhere else n no darn job!! but i only missed 1 question on the front page of my precalc test...woot woot...but it was worth 3 points :( but still better! oh yeah um heres the only few things on my mind right nopw cuz i just woke up from a nap which was tres tres cool. 

~~ok so i have made up my mind. i am going back packing thru europe the summer before i go to college. and im not talking about like planning everything out. im talking about walking thru the countryside. sleeping in doorways. the real backpacking part. i dont care what any of you think. and your not going to change my mind. i know its dangerous. i know its stupid. and the million other reasons. but im going. ive always wanted this. at first i thought i would take a year off to do it. but ive decided not to. i think it was really brought into my mind today because this guy came into our french class today and talked about his experience because he had done exactly that. and just wow it seems so amazing and you would learn so much. so yeah. anybody want to join me. im looking for like one other person or like two who would maybe want to do this with me. because then you would b cool. but i just really want to do it. and as soon as i get a job ima start putting like 20 each week. thatll b a lot for when it finally comes time to go. 

~another thing: noie, lets go on sunday ok. cuz i want to go see leminy snickets. so we could go like in afternoon ok? do u still have steves number at all? and i said that cuz i wanted to go christmas shopping on  both days. but i really dont. i dont know why i was thinking i did. but that was a brain fart lol.

~~mr. lares ""holiday party"" was more like cupcakes n juice boxes...boooo! but yay u bought us cupcakes that was nice. but IT WASNT NO PARTAY lol ahhah brian n sarah went caroling w/ the piano down the hall lol.

"event","ok well see i havent updated in a while for a reason. whats there to update about?? nothing. because nothing new is going on in my life. besides the fact that im kinda hungry right now. but oh yeah guess what i am the new officer of 

~~SECRETARY OF THE CHESS CLUB~~ BEEHOTCHES!

woot woot so that makes me an officer of chess club and sadd. woot woot to extra curriculars!  haha well talking to noie now trying to figure out if were gunna go get food tommarow. but the psat results are in and i gots ta get mines ya heard lol. random sentence of ghettoness. ok these two songs are like constantly playing thru out my head like sooo gosh darn much. 1-2-step and beautiful soul. i wanna guy to sing beautiful soul to me and i wanna learn the moves to 1-2-step. but oh yeah other thoughts going thru my head:
joel snell is really hott. so is jake wither. so is a lot of guys at our school which i will not mention. but those two just stick out to me so make of it what you will but it means nothing to you trying to find meaning-ers. lol haha had to say that yo.

ohh hmmm lately i think i have been filled with hatred deep down inside of me towards my family. i think ima try n stop that. but the hatred for him will probably not stop even though i know god would want me to forgive and forget and not hate, i just cant help it everything about the guy irks me. like staying in the same room annoys the crap outta me and i just get so agigtated that i start snapping at everyone. i just dont understand her, how she cant see hes like taking over her life. everything that once mattered to her is slowly being taken out of her control and into his. oh well im outta here and this whole fucking state in a matter of almost two years. bitches and hoes, i swear im getting as far away from this messed up place that i can. actually im thinking about moving into karens just for the summer. 


haha all day ive had the line from dodgeball stuck in my head. "" you go ahead and make your jokes...mr.jokey.....joke-man"" lol hahaha so great.


ohh also desperately hoping for a snow day tommarow even tho i kno its prolly not gunna happen cuz the snow has stopped. ima have some faith.


hmmm mcdonalds sounds amazing right now. .....or even taco bell.....mmmmmmmmmmmmmm....*salivation*

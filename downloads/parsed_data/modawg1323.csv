"event","So I'm in my room, between classes.  Wednesdays are crazy...i go from 7:25 class to 8:30 class, home, 10:40 class, home, 12:50 lab.  ugh.  Tonight I have new member announcing and my first flag football practice as well.  Yippie!  The NM announcing is going pretty swell.  Though it is pretty embarassing and I am not a huge fan of our song, I'm having fun with it.  For those who don't know what NM announcing is, which is prolly no one since barely anyone reads this, it is where all the new members in each sorority go from frat to frat singing and dancing to a song.  The song is written with words about our pledge class to the tune of a popular song.  Ours is a mix between Jack Johnson's ""Bubble Toes"" and Jessica Simpson's ""These Boots (Were Made For Walkin').""  Anways, enough of that panhellenic mumbo jumbo...this week better go by fast because I am so pumped for the weekend already.  College football Saturdays are the best days known to man.  My family's even coming up this weekend (its AXO fam. weekend) so I'm totally excited to see them.  Hopefully they bring me goodies :) haha Well I'm gonna get going.  Linguistics time!"

"event","So I've been listening to a lot of Dashboard lately...I don't know why.  It's just been coinciding with my moods I guess.  I really like the song vindicated...here it is...I figured since I'm listening to it right now I'd put the lyrics here to make a mental note of this moment :)  

Hope dangles on a string
Like slow spinning redemption
Winding in and winding out
The shine of it has caught my eye
And roped me in
So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing
I am captivated, I am
Vindicated
I am selfish
I am wrong
I am right
I swear I'm right
Swear I knew it all along
And I am flawed, but I am cleaning up so well
I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself
So clear
Like the diamond in your ring
Cut to mirror your intention
Oversized and overwhelmed
The shine of which has caught my eye
And rendered me
So isolated,and so motivated
I am certain now that I am
{Chorus}
So turn
Up the corners of your lips
Part them and feel my finger tips
Trace the moment, fall forever
Defense is paper thin
Just one touch and I'll be in
Too deep now to ever swim against the current
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip against the current
So let me slip away 
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
{Chorus}
My hope
dangles on a string
Like slow spinning redemption...

"event","This entry was posted on my myspace blog, but I felt like putting it here because I haven't posted in my LJ for a while and I like reading my old entries...I always come upon them and laugh.  

So today was my last day at camp...sadness :(  It was a really awesome summer job.  The counselors were AMAZING and the kids weren't so bad either.  I mean, some were bad....but on the whole, I will miss the kids.  Here, lemme tell you a little bit about some of my most memorable campers.  First and foremost, we have Mike Jones- little 10 year old Michael Rothman with a hypothyroid problem, so he's really small.  He was a frequent flyer.  I only think he missed a week or 2 of the 11 week camp.  Ever since week 1 we called him Mike Jones...after the rapper, of course, and it never got old.  We'd yell WHO? and he'd come back with the cutest smile and high pitched voice yelling ""MIKE JOOONES!""  Aww, I'll miss the little guy.  Skate patrol at the ice den even made him a hockey jersey that said his name on the back and for his # they wrote ""281-330-8004.""  Adorable.  The background on my phone is a priceless image of him with a huge grin, flicking my camera off.  How sweet!  Anyways, enough about little Mikey Rothman.  We have another frequent flyer named Eric Farkas.  Farkas was like the leader of the pack.  All the kids loved Farkas.  He was kinda like the guy who all the girls had a crush on and all the boys wanted to hang out with.  If I had to choose a homecoming court of the frequent campers, he prolly woulda won king.  He was always shmoozin with the counselors and he'd bring in his Levitra (male enhancement) pen that, in order to operate, a button was pressed so the tip would elevate....i don't think I need to explain that one further.  Farkas also seemed to be very advanced for his age...I didn't know half the stuff he knew about boys and girls when I was 12 years old.  I sometimes wonder what he is like in school with kids his age...? Oh well.  On to my favorite camper.  Jonathan Knudsen.  I loved Jonathan.  He was the sweetest 12 year old I've ever met in my life.  His mom worked for MTV, so all summer she gave us tickets to the Hard Rock Live MTV tapings and I got to see 8 amazing concerts including artists such as TI, Mike Jones, Hot Hot Heat, and Gavin Degraw...iyy thank you.  Anyways, one day, a fellow counselor and I decided to take Mrs. Knudsen up on her offer to let us go to soundcheck for Franz Ferdinand.  In order to go, we had to take Jonathan with us after camp until 5 o'clock when we had to be at Hard Rock.  The only way I could go was if I wore what I was wearing (my work uniform) or if I bought new clothes because there was no way I could make it home and back in time.  So of course, since Millenia was on the way to Citywalk, we decided that it would take less time for me to just buy a new outfit than to backtrack all the way to my house since I live so far away.  Jonathan accompanied us on this trip and we allotted ourselves 25 minutes to get in and out of the mall with an outfit.  Geeze...it was awesome.  We did it.  I ran through forever 21 like a maniac with Jillian searchin for possible outfits, and each one we found we would hand to Jonathan who we had waiting in a huge dressing room line.  We figured it would save time if one of us waited with all the outfits and I just tried em all on at once and chose something outta the pile.  I don;t know many kids who would stand in the dressing room line at the mall for their camp counselor.  He surely didn't have to, but he did, because he is that nice.  We were in and outta that store in a jiff and I almost died when I had to break it to Jonathan that I needed underwear. lol.  I was like ""um...you don't hafta come in here but it's really important that I buy new underwear""  because my new outfit included a white flowy skirt.  So he was like ""ok!"" and walked right into Victoria's Secret with Jillian and I.  Farkas woulda loved to have been in Jonathans shoes for that.  Anyways, I don't know where I was going with that other than to prove a point that Jonathan was the coolest kid and he was practically like a brother this summer.  He always helped with the kids whenever the counselors asked him.  Monday he had a show at SAK comedy lab...his graduation from the teenprov classes.  He was so cute.  We all went to watch him perform.  I never realized that I would actually come to care about the frequent campers outside of camp, but hey...sometimes you just gotta look at yourself in the mirror and say ""when in rome.."" haha jk. All 3 of those boys are really awesome kids who I can learn a lot from.  There were obviously a lot more than 3 kids at camp, but if I talked about em all, I'd hafta write a book.  Those boys were like the 3 amigos and I just wanted to write a little down so I'll remember em during the year and be able to laugh.  Maybe I'll write about other anecdotes later, but for now, I'm gonna rest up a little....the Packers play at 8 and I wanna nap b4 the game.  Yay!  Buh bye!!"

"event","Today was a good day.  Isabella, an 11 year old camper, is such a baller.  Ashley and I were working out today after work...as usual...our Monday, Wednesday, Friday routine, and we ran into Isabella and her mom who was about to check her into Kids Stuff.  When we saw Mrs. Lopez, Ashley and I offered to take her daughter to work out with us while she ran because we felt like Isabella would be bored with the little kids.  The mother gladly took us up on our offer and we got to have a little trainee for the afternoon.  Isabella is such a hoss.  She watched and half-participated in all our routine activities...lol and when we were doing calves, she dropped on the floor and started doing push-ups!  What a sweetheart...she even started to push me towards the end of arms counting out ""5, 4, 3...almost done!""  I love working at RDV.  I saw Mike, my favorite trainer, and Pat, my expert counselor.  Ok...have you ever seen the ""Pat"" skit on SNL?  Well Pat is like the embodiment of that character only she is a beast...and friendly.  She lifts more and works harder than a large number of guys I know.  Today, it was hilarious, Ashley and I were watching which locker room ""she"" went into and she didn't go into either!!! Pat uses the lockers out in the gym!  We were like, wow, if that isn't the poster child for the stereotypical ""Pat"" I don't know who is.  Whew!  Good times.  I'm up out this biz nass...din din.  Catch ya dawgs on the flip side."

Anyways...today was a decent day at work.  I'm Mike Jones! Don't act like u dont know the name.  After work was real good...had a nice work out with the girls ;) Who? Mike Jones!  I think working out after work puts me in a better mood.  I'll hafta work out more often.  The people around the gym always put a smile on my gangsta face.  It's pretty ballin' I'd say. 

Well since I'm actually in a good mood I'll stop rambling and let you leave me some love if you're reading...I'd love to hear from ya."

"event","Ever been sad for no reason?  I don't know why but the past few days have been depressing or something.  I feel like torn or lonely or bored with life, I'm not sure.  I mean I have no reason to be like this...nothing is significantly wrong...yesterday I felt a little under the weather...yea...but no big deal.  Camp is going well and my campers behave well, but I don't feel like I'm all there.  This is the first week when I dont even know all my kids' names.  It's terrible.  
Ever been caught between a rock and a hard place?  Well, that's where I think I am, only I'm not sure what the rock or the hard place is.  It's weird.  Lemme know if you've ever had the feeling and how it worked out for you.  I'd be interested to know.  I know I'll be completely fine and I'm not worried about what the future has in store...I just wish this feeling would go away so I could be happy and goofy like normal."

"event","So today has been a relatively stressful day.  This morning I realized I had like a bagillion things to do, so I actually made a ""To Do"" list.  Those things are actually way helpful and they minimize your stress level consideraby...I highly recommend you use one whenever you start freaking out about something...putting things on paper will make your world a happier place...well unless you're a tree hugger...I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate people like me ruining your precious resources but eh, you'll get over it.  Anyways, it turns out a large portion of my list was taken care of today when I found out my online homework and quizzes were moved to next week instead of tomorrow morning.  Wahoo!  That is good stuff cause I have a relatively busy weekend schedule.  In a little while I will be heading off to a gymnastics meet...don't roll your eyes- it is so much fun...plus, they're giving away free foam cowboy hats to the first 1000 fans, and I am a member of the RTR (Rumblin' Tumblin' Reptiles) so it's important for me to show my face.  Yea, yea I know...RTR? you say...well, it was free to join and I got a free shirt...I'm all about the giveways.  Hey, tomorrow I'm going to Arkadia and they're going to give away a free vacation to Brazil during spring break.  For those of you who don't know of Arkadia, it's a relatively new club in Gainesville...I'm not much of a club-goer but I have VIP access.  That's  right.  Actually the story behind my VIPism is kinda gay but here it is...some girl messaged me on the facebook because I posted that I was selling my english book and she was interested.  Turns out the girl works on Arkadia's promotional team and she was so grateful that I was willing to give her my book on such late notice that she offered to put me and all of my friends on Arkadia's VIP list...so if you wanna be on it, lemme know and I'll tell her.  So all week Katie and I have been begging Jarrod and Ryan to come with us girls Saturday night.  I actually think they're gonna come, which is like a huge deal!  They are totally not the club-going type and they are gonna try it out just for fun.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Ok well I need to shower and whatnot so I'll catch ya later.  Buh byee!"

"event","I am torn.  I dont know whether I should stay awake till my next class or take a nap.  You see I was up coughing for a while last night, so my sleep was pretty bad.  I want to take a nap just to get some rest, but I'm really not tired at all.  Grrr! Don't you hate when that happens?  Oh well...lemme play this song for you while I decide...

Well its been building up inside of me 
For oh I don't know how long 
I don't know why 
But I keep thinking 
Something's bound to go wrong 

But she looks in my eyes 
And makes me realize 
And she says ""Don't worry baby"" 
Don't worry baby 
Don't worry baby 
Everything will turn out alright 
Don't worry baby 

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut 
When I started to brag about my car 
But I can't back down now 
I pushed the other guys too far 

She makes me come alive 
And makes me wanna drive 
When she says ""Don't worry baby"" 
Don't worry baby 
Don't worry baby 
Everything will turn out alright 
Don't worry baby 

She told me ""Baby, when you race today 
Just take along my love with you 
And if you know how much I loved you 
Baby nothing could go wrong with you"" 

Oh what she does to me 
When she makes love to me 
And she says ""Don't worry baby"" 
Don't worry baby 
Don't worry baby 
Everything will turn out alright 
Don't worry baby 

(sigh...) I <3 the Beach Boys.  Ok that's it...I'm staying up!  Thanks for all your help.  Yay!  Shower time!"

"event","So besides the fact that I am feeling a little under the weather, today has been wonderful.  I spent this morning doing window design in our store for the new Valentine's Day merchandise.  It was very relaxing and a lot of fun...I've learned that work is great for me because it takes my mind off the little everyday things that stress me out.  I also work in a pretty fun environment, so I normally have a good time when I'm on the clock :)  That is probably because I've only been working at Victoria's Secret for 3 weeks, but whatever.  Anyways, the new window display at our store contatins giant (oversized) black gift boxes with satin bows and there is a mannikin between the set of boxes wearing some black lingerie.  On the window it says ""give me sexy.""  This morning I was putting the decal on the store window before the mall opened and it was so awkward because old men would walk by and here I am with a sign that says ""give me sexy.""  Later I realized why I was getting the funny looks.  We also have a sign on one of our sleepwear sets that says ""better than chocolate,"" and though the set is totally adorable, I am afraid Vicky S is guilty of a little false advertising cause I don't know much of anything that is better than chocolate.  mmm I <3 chocolate...I think it's a girl thing.  Anyways, when we finally opened our store, business was crankin.  You always feel good after a nice day's work, ya know.  So I've been in a good mood pretty much all day which is nice cause I've been a little 'eh' for the past few days.  I am very excited about tonight also...(insert joyful trumpet music here) for tonight is the season premiere of American Idol.  Sounds gay, I know, but I've been watchin AI since the first episode, first season and I am addicted.  I am actually going to meet some friends (girl friends yay) along with Ryan soon and we're gonna eat dinner and then totally make fun of all the sucky singers for 2 hours.  Is it sad how much fun that is for me?  Oh well, it's all good.  I better go get ready for that and leave you alone because you probably don't care about anything I just said.  Until next time....ta ta!"

"event","Ok, so I worked 10 hours today.  My feet are tired, my throat is sore, and I am just plum tuckered out.  I am also very tired from last night because I went out with an old buddy and met some of his friends...come to think of it, I am very impressed that I didn't pass out at work given the amount of sleep I had.  Anyways, back to last night...I'm glad I actually went out because I tend to cling on to the same group of people all the time.  Since all my ""friends"" are in Orlando, Ryan's in NYC (which i am completely jealous of), and my roommate's busy with her guests, I figured it would be a really sucky weekend.  Well, that all changed when a friend of mine invited me to a party and I actually accepted the offer.  I met a ton of people and I actually felt social for like the first time since I've been in college...that is kinda sad.  Turns out 75% of the new people I met were guys which is totally cool and all, but I need to start making more female friends.  It may sound weird because some girls would love to be in my position, but it's so frustrating having mostly guy friends.  You see, with these guys there is no sexual attraction whatsoever because I love my boyfriend very much and I am not a sleaze bag.  I love being chummy with guys and I have a very playful personality, but sometimes I feel I need someone I could take with me to the mall you know, or stay up all night watching chick flicks with.  Or some friends to take out for ice cream when someone got an A on an exam.  Someone to look at magazines with at night and say ""OMG that is so cute! I have to have it!"" and then actually not buying it the next day but doing something fun instead like playing with each others' hair or getting our nails done...maybe even laying out by the pool.  It is so frustrating having to do the girly things alone now that I don't live at home anymore.  Ugh.  Oh well.  I bet I will eventually meet those people.  I sure hope I do.  Well...since it's getting late and I'm kinda tired, I'm gonna snuggle up in bed with a hot chocolate and watch Garden State...yea I know, sounds pathetic but some alone time sounds fine to me right now. Yes, it sounds fabulous.  Hmmm well tomorrow's another day, and you know what they say...""another day, another dollar."""

"event","Ew....It is so ugly outside today!  Normally I like the rain, but I hate yucky weather.  Today it's not quite raining, but it's cold out and there is like a misty drizzle...kinda like the clouds are spitting at people.  Gross...I hate it.  I had class this morning at 8:30, and for the first time this semester I came back and took a nap.  It seems like it keeps getting uglier as the day goes on...boo.  I don't wanna go anywhere or do anything, but that might work out for me because it seems like everyone is going home for the 3 day weekend.  So for now, it's just me and Abi (my roommate) chilling with her boyfriend and brother who came up to visit from beautiful Hollywood, FL...I wanna see it some time.  I'm sure it's nicer than Gainesville.  I do not like Gainesville very much...I mean I love UF but I hate the town.  Oy.  Oh well I'll be back later~ I've gotta find something to do."

"event","So I just got home from work...today seemed to be ""guys buy sexy things for you lady"" day.  I love watching guys come into the store.  Why are guys usually so terrified to go into Victoria's Secret?  Watching the mannerisms of a guy looking through lingerie is one of the funnier things I've ever seen.  One guy today came in with his girlfriend, so of course I had to eavesdrop on their conversation while walking around.  The dude kept picking things up and saying to the girl ""that's kinda hot"" or ""ohhh you should wear this"" and way he holds up the little two piece set is hysterical. I guess boys will be boys.  The weird thing though is that when guys rummage through the merchandise, they touch things like as if they were contaminated or something.  Believe me guys...Nothing is going to jump out and bite your hand off.  I admire a guy who will shop with his gal pal...most guys hate it.  Today I just want to honor all those guys who go through the pain and existential boredom of shopping for a girl...with or without her there.  Moving right along...I'd also like to bring up the fact that I am starting to like this waking up early deal.  I really get so much more done because my day is so much longer.  You know what sucks though?  The 1st 5 minutes after the alarm goes off.  I was in a slumber that was deeper than the Mariana Trench this morning when my stupid alarm went off...and I have the annoying kind of alarm too...the loud beeping kind.  I was extremely close to going back to sleep and saying ""to heck with Chem discussion,"" but at the last second b4 I drifted back to sleep, I remembered I had spent yesterday afternoon in preparation for this morning's class.  Not going to class would have made yesterday a total waste.  Anyway, I went to class and my TA picked random students to go to the board and work out the homework problems for a pop-participation quiz...guess who lucky selection #1 happened to be?  That's right...Morgan Leary.  Needless to say, I was very happy I decided to wake up.  So there's your lesson kids: wake up and go to class even if you don't want to...because with your luck, you will be the first person called out.  Muah!  (More to come later)"

"event","Hey there!  Today kinda sucked.  I hate Mondays and Wednesdays because those are the days when I have more classes than I can count on my right hand...and yes, my right hand has 5 fingers.  I tried to dress all cute to make the day go by faster and happier, you know with a polo shirt and pearls, but I didn't feel very different (although I know I looked a bit nicer than I usually do..I'm not gonna lie).  Even though today sucked I am in a decent mood right now because my neighbor is blasting some house music.  I am feeling it flow right through my body- a relaxing way to enjoy my evening alone, in my room.  I am pretty easily entertained.  Anyways, UF basketball is playing Auburn on TV right now.  I love FL basketball...it surely is faaantastic.  My favorite player on the team is Joakim Noah...not only does he wear the best number, the luckiest number, MY number: 13 (it really hasn't brought me much luck but I still love it), he also has the coolest hair I've ever seen in my life (besides Randy Moss).  Supposedly the dude's parents are a pro-tennis star and a model...just like my own.  We have so much in common.  I have a newspaper clipping with his picture on my wall above my bed so everyday when I come home he's there to be like ""Whatup Mo?""  But seriously, he is a true inspiration to me because he is always having fun.  He puts his heart into everything he does and I wish I could be more like that myself.  Anyways, enough of my ode to Jo.  I think panties are fun.  I have been working at Victoria's Secret for about 2 weeks now and it has been a blast.  Kinda funny because a lot of people who know me are not aware of my girly side.  Basically, all I do at work is help people find out how big their boobs are and convince them why they should buy our merchandise.  Wanna know why they should buy our merchandise?  Because it is totally adorable.  Guys...girls love the ""pink"" line that Victoria's Secret has come out with so keep that in mind.  Plus, our spring line is absolutely gorgeous.  Have you ever seen a yellow bra?  My guess is no...come to the store-we totally have them now.  We're also getting stuff in for Valentine's Day ooolala! :)  Well, since it is only my first entry I'll stop here cause I tend to ramble on and on sometimes...especially when I'm bored.  Until next time...muah!"

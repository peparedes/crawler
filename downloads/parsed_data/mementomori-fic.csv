<br />
<br />They sat in complete silence, forehead to forehead. And Severus could feel his cheeks burning with anger all over again, but it was too late. She knew. Where they were supposed to go from here, he had no clue.<br />
<br />He was beyond shocked when she moved forward, hands moving swiftly from his jaw to somewhere behind his back. He was pulled into an embrace he had no idea how to quantify or respond to&hellip;except to exhale deeply and bury his face in her neck. She embraced him now the way she had when they were fourteen, when she had seen a horrible memory of his father&rsquo;s worst fit to date. Tobias had locked himself in the coal bunker as penance for backhanding a twelve year old Severus after a burst of temperamental magic. That she was trying now to protect or at least comfort him after seeing into his memory made him feel safe, rather than embarrassed &hellip;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I lost control,&rdquo; she said simply, releasing him and turning toward her teacup.<br />
<br />Severus turned sharply to see Lourdes staring rather apathetically into her teacup, tracing the rim with a finger.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Come again?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take that much life and not waste it. I lost control. That&rsquo;s what he meant.&rdquo; She stopped short at the sudden disturbance in the atmosphere. Something small and light darted in through the window and for a split second Severus thought it was a moth, but it quickly erupted into a silver flash shaped like a phoenix.<br />
<br />Severus was tempted to go straight through the Floo to Albus&rsquo; office and tell him to stay put until things were managed, but that would only make it painfully obvious that something had gone wrong. There wouldn&rsquo;t have been time for that anyway because the instant the image of the phoenix faded from his retinas, Severus heard a knock at the front door. Lourdes frowned a bit and seemed confused, looking down at her mostly bare legs and back up at him as if wondering whether or not to bother.<br />
<br />&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dressing gown in the second wardrobe,&rdquo; he muttered, glad for any excuse to buy time alone with Albus.<br />
<br />When Lourdes vanished up the stairs, Severus slammed the bookcase behind her and dimmed the lights in the main room to barely a glow, just in case. Wand at the ready, he eased the door open just a crack and stared out suspiciously.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Good evening, Severus.&rdquo; Albus&rsquo; tone was cool and firm, but his expression indicated that he was in no mood to tolerate any rebellion.<br />
<br />Severus stepped back to let him in, and gestured to the sofa. &ldquo;Tea?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; Albus said patiently, passing Severus to cross into the kitchen directly and pulling up a chair. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;<br />
<br />The creaking of floorboards above gave away her position, and he counted her light footsteps down the stairs before Lourdes finally wandered into the kitchen, back in her robes, clutching a little round tin.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Albus,&rdquo; she said mildly before snapping up the teapot and padding over to the stove. Lourdes proceeded to bang around the cabinets, constructing a makeshift samovar out of the kettle and a smaller iron teapot before demanding that someone transfigure a bergamot for her, which she grated violently into the tea leaves she&rsquo;d brought down with her. The Tngri was summoned, cavorting around the teapot in the confines of the stove burner as if it were some delightful game to heat water.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Would you care to fill me in on the events of this evening?&rdquo; Albus said, raising his voice above the sound of Lourdes slamming the tea strainer against the sink with unnecessary force.<br />
<br />Severus hesitated a moment, but saw no benefit in trying to delay the inevitable. &ldquo;Certainly, but I&rsquo;m still not entirely clear on what happened myself. We were called, not so much we as her, and myself as the necessary transportation. Something to do with Avery, and Lourdes was brought in to&hellip;&rdquo; Severus stopped and glared at his nearly empty teacup, &ldquo;punish him.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I see. Who was present?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Rookwood,&rdquo; Severus muttered, and paused. Albus&rsquo; eyes lit up instantly, he&rsquo;d been present at Rookwood&rsquo;s trial for treason against the Ministry and the Department of Mysteries.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Though, Rookwood wouldn&rsquo;t say anything to me about what had gone on before we got there. Coming out of Azkaban I&rsquo;d say he doesn&rsquo;t trust me as far as he could throw me. Avery was there, of course. I didn&rsquo;t see anyone else but I didn&rsquo;t get to look. Lourdes was in there alone.&rdquo;<br />
<br />There was a tense lull in the conversation, and Albus took the opportunity to give him a very harsh look. Severus&rsquo; stomach twisted as though he&rsquo;d just been caught actively trying to get rid of Lourdes and felt a light sheen of sweat pop out over his forehead. He couldn&rsquo;t stop his eyes from darting abruptly over in her direction for a fraction of a second and he caught sight of her, lip clamped firmly between her teeth as she glared at the both of them..<br />
<br />&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t allowed in, I didn&rsquo;t have a choice,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;But something happened, the Dark Lord wouldn&rsquo;t say what, though&hellip;&rdquo; Severus faltered, pressing his lips together and tapping his fingers against the table, wishing he didn&rsquo;t have to say what he was about to. &ldquo;Though, he wished to impress upon us the utmost importance of Lourdes remaining in control of her magic at all times, and he proceeded to make a visceral impact on her.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;She was tortured, you mean.&rdquo; Albus followed that statement by giving Severus what he supposed was meant to be a very significant look, but what the significance was Severus couldn&rsquo;t be sure. Though, Severus thought dizzily, it felt suspiciously as though Albus was placing blame&hellip;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Pleased to remind you both that I&rsquo;m in the room,&rdquo; Lourdes snapped, as she pulled the jumble of pots off the range.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Severus felt a fresh surge of anger well up in the back of his throat when he made eye contact with Albus. How dare Albus implicate him, Lourdes wouldn&rsquo;t have to BE here, doing this if Albus hadn&rsquo;t asked her&hellip; This was his fault.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Well, I appreciate that you&rsquo;ve done your best to care for her considering the situation, and I can&rsquo;t help but say I&rsquo;m pleased that you two are working together. But, tell me, Severus, why is it that you didn&rsquo;t report back immediately, considering the situation?&rdquo;<br />
<br />This question was sufficiently interesting to pique Lourdes&rsquo; interest as well. Severus narrowed his eyes and said coolly, &ldquo;I know the difficulty involved in giving a report immediately after a trying experience. I merely wished to provide Lourdes with time to collect herself without the stress associated with being in my quarters under summon.&rdquo;<br />
<br />Lourdes chose to punctuate that statement by slamming the teapot on the table before taking her chair. In surprisingly good humor, Albus proceeded to pour cups of very strong tea all around.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Severus doesn&rsquo;t know what happened to incite my&hellip; punishment, but I do. There wasn&rsquo;t anything he could have done to stop it,&rdquo; Lourdes said coolly, turning her lip up at Albus. &ldquo;But I have some information you may be interested in, Albus. Rather valuable information unique to my condition.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m eager to hear it.&rdquo; Considering her attitude, and Severus&rsquo; suspicious behavior, Albus was handling the whole affair with remarkable composure, as though he was still in perfect control of a situation that seemed too fractured to see as a whole.<br />
<br />&ldquo;My information comes at a price. Still interested?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a habit of mine to pay for information Lourdes, you know that.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bargaining for cash, my bank account isn&rsquo;t suffering while I&rsquo;m living for free and you know it. I&rsquo;m asking for something much more valuable in return for some information that may be absolutely critical. The price is a back door out of this, for me and for Severus, if things go pear shaped. Give me a five day reprieve, the Dark Lord won&rsquo;t be calling me in the next few days. Let me go to Turkey; I have a contact there who owes me a favor and is extremely discrete. He&rsquo;ll have to be, and I&rsquo;ll be able to seal him on his word. In return, you get my information and an additional contact within the Turkish government and I&rsquo;ll be able to pick up my books and arrange a safety net.&rdquo;<br />
<br />For a moment the kitchen was dead silent as Albus looked politely contemplative, and Lourdes fixed him with an icy, smug smile. Severus watched the whole exchange feeling vaguely suspicious as to why Lourdes was bargaining on his behalf as well - it made him a little uncomfortable.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Think about it, Albus. You&rsquo;ve got a very valuable informant in Severus, but he&rsquo;s in your debt. I&rsquo;m a different story. I don&rsquo;t owe you anything after the disposal of those two Death Eaters in Bulgaria. I think this time&hellip;you owe me,&rdquo; Lourdes said, in that &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t this reasonable?&rsquo; tone she must have honed while striking deals with convicts. Though in Severus&rsquo; experience trying to strong arm Albus into doing anything never ended well&hellip;<br />
<br />Very calmly, Albus had a slow sip of his tea and smiled mildly before he nodded. &ldquo;An agreeable bargain, Lourdes. Shall we shake hands or would you prefer a signature?&rdquo; When he mentioned signature, he raised an eyebrow suspiciously and Lourdes smirked.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Not to worry, never bothered to sign family into anything, and you&rsquo;re as good as family,&rdquo; she said, extending a hand to meet Albus&rsquo;. There was an odd frisson of energy the moment their hands clasped and the deal was apparently sealed.<br />
<br />&ldquo;He had me take 80 out of 90 years on Avery, but I can&rsquo;t hold 80 years in one transfer without losing some of it. But, I was afraid he&rsquo;d find out I shortchanged him, so I panicked and started the transfer before he was ready. And I slipped,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Lost control for a moment, and&hellip;slipped.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;And what did you discover?&rdquo; Albus asked.<br />
<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of what I didn&rsquo;t see.&rdquo; Lourdes looked up and away for a moment as though she couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out how to phrase what she wanted to say. &ldquo;Normally, when I see life, it&rsquo;s like&hellip;string. Spent years are already formed and readable, tied in to memories and other mental structures I can&rsquo;t directly access as an Evocator. But the potential years are&hellip;well they look like they&rsquo;re wound around their soul&hellip;sort of. Everything is bright inside, and everything is intact.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m rambling, let&rsquo;s begin at the beginning. We live in an amoral universe, as much as we, and you, would like to believe otherwise&hellip;Albus.&rdquo; Lourdes paused to give him a very stern look. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a universe which perpetually seeks balance. For every destructive action there is a consequence: steal unicorn blood to prolong your life and you inherit a degenerative curse, distort the natural state of your soul and you damage yourself irreparably. What I saw in the Dark Lord when I slipped wasn&rsquo;t like anything I&rsquo;ve ever experienced. Do you remember when you had us clean out that mirror?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Albus said, nodding slowly as he wore a look of deep concentration. His eyebrows had quirked up the littlest bit, which told Severus that Albus was far more interested in this than he was letting on.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Well, I found what I now know to be part of him in someone else, that Quirrell person, so I know that the Dark Lord is in sorrier shape than anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen. His soul is actively disintegrating, even though the body change got rid of the curse he would have inherited from drinking unicorn&rsquo;s blood. And that loss of soul has made room for more force, more magic but it damages the thing that makes him human &ndash; it degrades the quality of his connection to reality. Now, the Bran&rsquo;s Cauldron spell you said he used to build his current body only gives what they call &lsquo;the breath of bones,&rsquo; that is to say cobbled, artificial life like a homunculus or a golem. He wouldn&rsquo;t get more than 10 years out of the components in the spell so he&rsquo;d need new life for the new body, or risk acquiring a new body after this one runs out. But changing bodies every ten years? That seemed so improbable and it&rsquo;s more than a little inconvenient.<br />
<br />&ldquo;But I was making those calculations around the idea that he had an entire soul to support. But he doesn&rsquo;t, not even close; I think he needs less life because he&rsquo;s got less to support, and I think he planned on that before he used the Bran&rsquo;s Cauldron spell. There&rsquo;s only a scrap of a soul in there, Albus, and it&rsquo;s not scraps from a Dementor job. I haven&rsquo;t seen anything like it; and to be honest I&rsquo;m still having trouble wrapping my mind around it. But he felt me in there, touching whatever soul was left over, and that&rsquo;s why he went after me. The only good news is he thinks I&rsquo;m too stupid to put it all together and figure out that he&rsquo;s definitely fragmented. I can&rsquo;t say if its Horcruxes, though, you&rsquo;re only supposed to be able to split it once if you can split it at all, and even after 100 body changes and seven lifetimes of evil, half a soul shouldn&rsquo;t be decomposed that badly. So&hellip;it probably raises more questions than it actually answers,&rdquo; Lourdes sighed.<br />
<br />It was very quiet for a few moments while Albus digested all that and finally nodded as though satisfied.<br />
<br />&ldquo;No, actually&hellip; I believe this gives me quite a bit to go on, Lourdes.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I know it would be&hellip;easier if I knew what I was looking at or some signpost to look for, but its completely alien territory even for me. I wasn&rsquo;t really looking for it, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll have much of a connection to concientia either, he&rsquo;s more non-being than being at this point. He&rsquo;s got magic and no law, that makes him far more dangerous than any demon&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;And how is next week? I can arrange travel for you on Monday. Though, I would caution you as to how visible you are. We don&rsquo;t yet know if the Death Eaters have plants in Turkey as well.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Sounds perfect,&rdquo; Lourdes said wearily. &ldquo;Trust me, nobody will notice. Nobody that&rsquo;ll talk, anyway.&rdquo;<br />
<br />Severus felt his wits slowly coming back to him; the entire exchange had come as more than a bit of a shock, and his brain was still chewing on the concept of the Dark Lord having a split soul. It was right about then that he realized he couldn&rsquo;t quite feel his face, and his mouth was hanging open. At a loss for words, he simply slouched back into his chair and sat for a moment as Lourdes and Albus solemnly discussed the niggling details of her travel. There was something off about the way Lourdes was bargaining, and there was definitely an issue they were both skirting...<br />
<br />Before he knew it, Albus was hauling himself out of the chair, shoulders sagging ever so slightly under the weight of this new information before he turned crisply to address Severus.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I do appreciate the delicate nature of your situation, Severus. I only ask that next time you alert me if you should encounter some extenuating circumstances and need time to recuperate, so that I&rsquo;m not forced to send signals through your old neighborhood.&rdquo; Albus looked grim and tired as he said that, but there wasn&rsquo;t a hint of condescension or a sign that there might be trouble for the two of them to be discussed later, so Severus took that as his cue to relax even further and simply let the silence wash over him as Albus disappeared from the house with a pop and left him alone with Lourdes.<br />
<br />&ldquo;My head hurts,&rdquo; she muttered, squeezing her eyes shut and clamping her hand over them. &ldquo;Would you mind dimming the light a bit?&rdquo;<br />Severus complied listlessly, and faced another long stretch of silence as he tried to contemplate what on earth he could possibly do next. It couldn&rsquo;t have been more than maybe, three hours ago that he&rsquo;d been sitting across from her at the tea table at Hogwarts. They&rsquo;d been fighting, but not fighting, something about biding their time instead of active pursuit.<br />
<br />It seemed almost ridiculous to have ever had such a conversation with anyone given what had just happened. Even more ridiculous when he considered it was Lourdes he was dealing with. And even though he felt like he&rsquo;d catalogued every gesture and quirk, every expression and mood, he was struck by the fact that he knew&hellip;almost nothing about her.<br />
<br />He turned his head a bit, and felt his face fall into an expression of cautious incredulity; who the hell was she? Severus knew the face, every inch, but he was horribly aware that beneath the rut-scarring on her cheeks, the tattoos, and her superstitious hairstyle, Lourdes kept ages of secrets, and some bizarre reservoir of magic he couldn&rsquo;t ever hope to touch.<br />
<br />And now&hellip;she knew. She knew his worst moment, and she sat there as though nothing had happened, nothing had changed.<br />Everything had changed in the most ridiculously short span of time. It made him dizzy, it made him want to lie down and have a sleep, to see if when he woke up it was all just a dream. The last time he&rsquo;d felt like this, he&rsquo;d sealed his deal with Albus, turned his back on the Dark Lord and put his life in danger indefinitely&hellip;<br />
<br />Did she represent the same amount of risk?<br />
<br />No.<br />
<br />No, she&rsquo;d just offered to include him in her escape route when she was bargaining with Albus, hadn&rsquo;t she?<br />
<br />&ldquo;How are you going to do it?&rdquo; Severus asked, feeling his eyes narrow and his brows contract into a suspicious expression.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Open up this back door. You can&rsquo;t assure whoever it is you&rsquo;re trying to rope into this won&rsquo;t turn on you?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Someone owes me a lost career, and three years of my life. I&rsquo;ve been saving this favor for something big, but I&rsquo;m not above a binding contract. In fact, I think I&rsquo;ll do it to keep my hand in,&rdquo; Lourdes said, with a bitter edge to her voice as she freshened up her tea.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Why include me?&rdquo; He pushed, leaning in towards her and feeling more than a little superstitious. She wasn&rsquo;t usually in the mood for charity.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Because, now I know,&rdquo; she said, staring blankly across the room at the wall of shelves packed with potions ingredients and cheap bottles of elf made wine he kept for unpleasant company.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; he spat. There was a hot flash of anger in his stomach. Lourdes was being so damn cryptic, and she&rsquo;d suddenly lapsed into single sentence, deadpan responses when she ought to be&hellip; paying attention or saying something. But the flash of anger was quickly doused by the sudden sound of rain on the roof and the pavement outside. It seemed that the storm he&rsquo;d seen coming from the cliff top had finally crossed over land, and it brought with it the reminder of her pale, blank face staring out over the ocean.<br />
<br />
<lj-cut>&ldquo;That you meant it.&rdquo;</lj-cut><lj-cut></lj-cut><br />&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Severus muttered, just to fill up the silence.<br />
<br />In fact, he didn&rsquo;t really see, he didn&rsquo;t have a clue where they were at the moment, aside from the fact that she was here in the house, in his private place. More than that, she was with him in the grey part of the world between people who thought in black and white. In the part where he was both separate from and oddly joined with both sides as a spy, someone of dubious loyalties, and someone who had made an irreparable mistake an age ago. When in the heat of his anger and ambition he&rsquo;d made a permanent exile of himself.<br />
<br />But half a world away at a different time, so had she. There was still a gap between them, but it had nothing to do with the space between the chairs.<br />
<br />These thoughts brought with them a very clear recollection of something that had started to grow midway through sixth year, unbidden. An idea about Lourdes which he&rsquo;d found strange and disturbing. He&rsquo;d put forward his best effort into keep it malnourished and stowed as far back as he could manage. It had made him question who he thought he was, what he thought he wanted. He had begun to realize he might be attracted to Lourdes too, despite the fact that she was so strange, so like him. She had become a good thing too after so many years of Occlumency, Legilimency, plots and study sessions. So many years of loyalty, comfort and kindness even when he was at his worst&hellip;<br />
<br />But how could he have been drawn to both of them? They were polar opposites! There was nothing about Lourdes which made him feel the rapture and possible freedom from himself that Lily brought. Instead Lourdes made him feel more himself, which he was not sure he liked. But it had come to nothing, she had died and the only thing left was the first good thing - Lily&hellip;<br />
<br />But now Lily was dead and Lourdes was alive. Right here, right next to him.<br />
<br />His heartbeat sped up from a tranquil beat to an adrenaline charged pound and his cheeks seemed to heat up as a feeling of pressure built behind them when he thought of moving across that gap, of changing the habits of thirty odd years and putting himself in the very real danger of her. It was fine to watch from a distance, but once all of his excuses for never moving closer to her were removed, the only answer to why he hadn&rsquo;t yet was fear.<br />
<br />And he didn&rsquo;t much relish the notion of being afraid.<br />
<br />The slow, rhythmic tick of the wall clock and the rain on the roof was the only sound for an age. Lourdes swayed in her seat slightly, eyelids drooping from sheer exhaustion, and for an uncomfortable and oddly exciting moment Severus thought she was going to lean in towards him. But she simply leaned forward instead.<br />
<br />&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;We wait, I suppose. On Albus, and your deal. This evening&rsquo;s excursion was, aside from whatever it is you discovered, a dead end,&rdquo; Severus replied glumly.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of waiting,&rdquo; she muttered. Her face melted into a distressed looking frown as she hauled herself out of her chair, across the floor, and into the dark warren of hallways and staircases.<br />
<br />Severus knew exactly what she was tired of and could not quite escape the feeling that she wasn&rsquo;t just moving across the house - she was widening the gap again. Fear turned his stomach upside down as he forced himself to walk toward the bookcase door and hesitated for a moment. Where would she go?<br />
<br />Outside&hellip;<br />
<br />_***_<br />
<br />Lourdes had hoped that the cold rain on the back porch would help kill the horrible feeling of searing heat across her cheeks and that fresh air might slow down the heavy pumping of her heart.<br />
<br />But she was only cold and soaking wet.<br />
<br />Dim light from distant street lamps glittered off the raindrops clinging to the hair hanging in front of her face before the water splashed down onto the backs of her hands.<br />
<br />Everything ached, everything hurt. There was a tight, strangling feeling in her throat, and a horrible tingling feeling in every limb and digit, but she wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was from anger, or residual magic from the spells inflicted on her earlier.<br />
<br />Perhaps it was what she&rsquo;d seen &ndash; all that obsession and twisting of Lily Evans into a surreal object of the most fervent devotion.<br />
<br />Lourdes had no way to understand, she&rsquo;d never loved anything the way Severus did because she had been shown how. So many happy years with her family, so much mutual love and devotion from Aberforth had taught Lourdes what was nourishing, and what was not. In her gut, she knew that obsession with a woman who had cut all ties when she was only fifteen, whom he&rsquo;d known as a girl but not as a woman, was a slow poison. But, how would he have learned the difference between nourishing and toxic? Who had ever really loved him? Who had he ever had to watch? Certainly no one in this house&hellip;<br />
<br />He must have known it was not healthy either, because instead of carrying this unrequited love like a battle standard for all to see, Severus hid it more thoroughly than any other secret. It represented a fatal flaw in his structure that made Lourdes feel she had to protect him simply because she might be the only other person who had seen its spread and depth, and that almost made her responsible.<br />
<br />But worst of all, Lourdes could not stop the images flashing insistently in her brain, snippets of this evening&#39;s punishment, memories of prison that smelled like rusting iron and blood, and the horrible niggling feeling that this could be the rest of her life. This dead end wallow in the worst, and blackest magic, permanently regarded as a convenient instrument of torture, yoked to a man who at any given moment could be poisoned by his own memory. She should have seen this coming, she thought, it had happened before at O.H.K. and she should have seen it coming the moment Albus told her he wanted her for a second spy.<br />
<br />Angrier by the moment, Lourdes let her head slip through her hands and rested it on her forearms, crossed between her knees so that the only thing she was able to see was the water dropping to make ripples on the little puddle of gathering water underneath her.<br />
<br />She hated every second she sat there, every second of dull ache in her chest, and time was so infuriatingly slow now. The very prospect of even another month of this life suddenly seemed like a thousand year sentence that would be agony every second she had to endure it, every second she fooled herself with the hopeful prospect of a way out, and it created a horrible, clawing panic in her chest.<br />It would be cold, it would be dark, and it looked like she would be alone.<br />
<br />Quite suddenly, the back garden gate looked like a very good idea. Run out that gate, go somewhere, anywhere, get away from this, leave the books, leave the things, leave even Aberforth, but get out alive. Get out now&hellip;<br />
<br />She stared, and stared, but could not seem to make her legs want to comply with the rest of her that was screaming to get out, and while she was absorbed in that internal debate.<br />
<br />The back door swung open and suddenly Severus was there in the dim porch light and the rain with her.<br />
<br />Oh, that was right. He was here too, wasn&rsquo;t he?<br />
<br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re soaking wet,&rdquo; he muttered, with an expression somewhere between a frown and a sneer as he tossed a bath towel over her shoulders and eased into the little space next to her on the porch.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Common side effect of exposure to rain,&rdquo; she said, with a roll of her eyes as she turned a little to look him in the face. That familiar crease of concentration appeared between his eyebrows as he frowned.<br />
<br />&ldquo;We used to be friends,&rdquo; he said slowly.<br />
<br />&lsquo;Yeah, we did,&rdquo; she sighed. There was no real tension between them now, she noticed. Just mutual exhaustion and, apparently, shared fear and hopelessness as well. Not a good place to be, but she was glad for the company. He looked so tired now that it was hard to believe this was the same nasty, sneering, occasionally decent Severus she&rsquo;d been glaring at for all these months. And it certainly wasn&rsquo;t the bitter, ambitious boy she&rsquo;d learned Occlumency with.<br />
<br />No. That memory, that slide through his humiliation and raw anger and pain, had changed him permanently in her mind, despite her best effort to rouse some anger, or resentment towards him. He knew what it felt like to come to the edge where for even an instant you no longer felt like a human and after finding that feeling, everything changes.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I, ah&hellip;&rdquo; Severus stopped and glared again as if he disapproved of what he wanted to say, and Lourdes quirked an eyebrow up and gave him a rather sarcastic smile.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get maudlin on me now.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t dream of it,&rdquo; he said, a hint of amusement in his voice as he cocked an eyebrow in return, leaning back a bit as if to survey her better. &ldquo;I wanted to thank you.&rdquo;

Matthew 16:26</i></div>&ldquo;Lumos.&rdquo;The lone lamp in the living room burst with light, and months of dust puffed and swirled with the draft from the door which was quickly slammed shut and locked.&nbsp; Being at the house on Spinner&#39;s End again was so familiar and comfortable that it gave him the strangest feeling of stepping into his own head. &nbsp;The momenth he stepped over the threshold, everything outside seemed like a loud, alien fantasy, and that he felt he had to touch, or eat, or drink something from &ldquo;his world&rdquo; to ground him again.&nbsp;<br /><br />Except that his private refuge had another occupant now.<br /><br />Severus knew every inch of the place by heart; he could walk around the little house with his eyes closed and not hit a single stick of furniture, unless he wanted to.&nbsp; The lights were for her benefit, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to notice.&nbsp; Lourdes stood in the middle of the room, shoulders hunched and fingers digging into her ribcage as she looked around blankly.<br /><br />Here there was no obligation to shove her into that dark Head of House passage to face Albus in this state.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t that Albus was cruel, but he&hellip;just didn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; But Severus knew all too well the difficulty of trying to deliver a report when your brain could hardly wrap itself around what had just happened.&nbsp; That, and right now he had to deal with the choking, guilty urge to fix her as fast as he could before anyone noticed the damage that had been done.<br /><br />It had happened before; he&rsquo;d accidentally split her across the stomach with <i>sectumsempra</i>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d tested it for ages on his hand and it had not seemed so bad, and supposed it would cause a haze of irritating scratches like a foray into a thorn patch.&nbsp; But Severus was very upset when they met to practice, he&rsquo;d just found out that Lily Evans had deigned to do the inevitable; date James Potter.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The spell he cast sliced far deeper than either of them had been prepared for.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The shocking amount of blood spilling over her hands from the deep wound made him panic and want to run as far away from culpability as possible. But he focused instead on fixing her, fumbling with his wand and the battered copy of The Emergency Healer&rsquo;s Manual which he&rsquo;d kept stuffed in his book bag since he&rsquo;d started experimenting.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d worked out a theoretical counter-curse at the start of the chapter on curse damage influence in wounds. It had taken five terrifying minutes of chanting the counter curse before it had been healed completely.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the aftermath there had been four sticky, bloody hands, two pale faces, and one ragged, puckered scar from hip to ribs. When he&rsquo;d helped her wash the worst of the blood off and donned her school robe over her shredded Muggle clothes, she had him curse her again.&nbsp; Burdening her with the huge set of rams horns Potter and Black were fond of hexing her with so she could turn herself into the Hospital Wing.<br />&nbsp;<br />He&rsquo;d fixed her then and nobody had had to find out.&nbsp;<br /><br />How to fix her now?&nbsp; Clean her up? Remove any evidence as before?<br /><br />With a flick of his wand, the bookshelves flew open on the hinges and the musty smell of uninhabited house grew stronger.&nbsp; Dragging Lourdes by the wrist behind him, he stumbled up the dark flight of steps towards the bathroom at the end of the hall. When the lights flickered on it looked to be passably clean, though there wasn&rsquo;t much he could do about the perpetual dinge, peeling paint and cracked plaster at this hour.&nbsp; Thrusting two threadbare towels and a wrapped bar of soap at her, he pointed at the tin bath.<br /><br />&ldquo;Wash,&rdquo; he said firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in the kitchen.&rdquo;<br /><br />Lourdes blinked and nodded slowly as he turned to leave, slamming the door firmly behind him.&nbsp; He was all the way down the stairs when he heard the hiss of water traveling through the old pipes again.&nbsp;<br /><br />What now?<br /><br />His brain stalled for a moment as he moved automatically towards the kitchen cabinets, hauling out the teapot and a dusty tin of leaves.<br /><br />That&rsquo;d do.<br /><br />He concentrated ferociously on all the steps of this simple task - find the pot, find the cups, clean them up, put on the water.&nbsp; Anything to keep his mind off the usual childhood memories that hovered at the edges of his conscious line of thought when he was at the house.&nbsp;<br /><br /><i>Small hands clutching the handle of the old cast iron frying pan to make eggs. </i><br /><br /><i>The tinny sound of the telephone, someone ringing from the church to ask him to fetch Dad.&nbsp; </i><br /><br /><i>Mum, collapsing at that table, in that chair by the little door, kicking off her shoes and giving him a weary smile.&nbsp; </i><br /><br /><i>What did my little prince learn today?</i><br /><br />-***-<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Lourdes could not stand still, but she did not want to move.&nbsp;&nbsp; A horrible ache had replaced the pain from an hour ago, and this new sensation seemed worse than what she&rsquo;d been dealt by Voldemort.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It pulsed in her chest, or at least that was the location she could vaguely pinpoint.&nbsp; Like the curse, it seemed to be pain beyond pain but this made her feel sick and heavy and as if right there at that moment she was about to lose her mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was exhausted, and wanted nothing more than to sleep, but knew it wouldn&rsquo;t come if she curled up on that dingy, cold floor.<br /><br />The bathtub did not seem real as she watched it fill with steaming water in the grimy yellow light from the bathroom fixtures.<br />&nbsp;<br />She did not know why Severus had told her to wash, especially now that she could examine her body inch by inch as the tub filled. There wasn&rsquo;t a single fresh mark, no bruises, lacerations, abrasions&hellip;nothing.&nbsp; Not an ounce proof on her skin that it had all really happened, and without wounds or bruises there were no familiar landmarks on how to deal with it, there was nothing she could touch to take care of.&nbsp;<br /><br />The heat of the water barely registered when she sank into it.&nbsp; She let her head flop back against the lip of the tub, not taking care to keep her braids dry as she took in the cracked plaster ceiling and tried for a moment to turn her brain off.<br /><br />And once again that new <i>ache</i> came in great pulsing waves like the water that had persistently ground down the cliffs she&rsquo;d been perched on minutes ago.&nbsp; Her heart beat slowly in her stomach as the image of the ceiling blurred before her eyes and she was suddenly aware that her face was wet, stiff and salty - with tears, of all things.<br /><br />When had she started crying?<br /><br />Sliding slowly underneath the hot water, Lourdes felt faced with an impossibly vital choice in that moment.&nbsp; Inhale and drown, or exhale, scream and see if it would help.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would certainly be easy.&nbsp; By the time she&rsquo;d pressed all the air out of her lungs and the last of the bubbles had vanished, she decided, rather numbly, that it would be better to pull the plug on than risk the temptation.<br /><br />Once every inch of skin she could see had been viciously scrubbed and inspected, and there were still no cuts or bruises to be found, Lourdes was not sure if she had imagined it all or not.&nbsp;<br /><br />Drifting automatically towards the largest bedroom, swaddled in the scratchy old towels, she started to rummage through a wardrobe for something to put on instead of her robes, which smelled like sweat and fear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wardrobe didn&rsquo;t offer much of a selection, but there was a very soft old button down that turned out to be far too large (the cuffs fell well over her hands), clean shorts and a pair of itchy wool socks.<br /><br />Tempting as the crisply made up but musty bed looked, Lourdes decided against crashing on strange sheets and wandered down the dark hallway with its stale unfamiliar smell, and was glad that she hadn&rsquo;t ever had to grow up in house like this.<br /><br />-***-<br /><br />Why had he always been too cheap to replace the furniture down here?&nbsp; Everything in this house was too old, even the teacups.&nbsp; The ones without cracks were the weird ones that belonged to his Mum when she did readings for the superstitious neighborhood ladies.<br /><br />Right about then, Severus realized he&rsquo;d been staring without blinking at a scorch mark in the counter top, made when he&rsquo;d been caught brewing potions outside of school.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tea kettle was screaming, and he had no idea how long it had been going like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he took the kettle off the heat he could hear the creaking of floorboards right above him, and soft footsteps.&nbsp; She was in the big bedroom, and now coming down the hall&hellip;<br /><br />When he turned around, Lourdes was staring at the book case that doubled as the kitchen door.&nbsp; Still damp from the bath and dwarfed by one of his dad&rsquo;s old shirts, that exposed mostly bare, scar streaked legs, Lourdes squinted to study the book titles while her braids dripped water onto the floor.<br /><br />She looked paler than usual, and tinged pink around the eyes and the end of her nose from what he suspected was too much crying.&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, seeing her padding around as if she knew the place by heart seemed&hellip;right.&nbsp; Lourdes had been inside his head so often in the past that this seemed perfectly natural.&nbsp; His brain seemed to stop, lurch, and blur at that notion &ndash; Lourdes belonging in this house - before he could shake himself into action again.<br /><br />&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; he managed, slopping tea over the edges of the cup as he shoved it into her hands.&nbsp; Lourdes shuffled in to the kitchen without argument and sank into a chair while Severus busied himself with the tea tray before finally taking his seat.&nbsp;<br /><br />And they sat for a moment in a crater of silence, shoulder to shoulder, with nothing to say, nothing they could say.&nbsp; After downing his tea faster than he thought possible, Severus had to stop to catch his breath and saw Lourdes studying the cup with the strangest look on her face.<br /><br />&ldquo;Would&#39;st thy fortune like to see? Perchance this cup will show to thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked up, slightly confused it seemed, and tapped the rim with one finger.&nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;These were my Mum&#39;s,&rdquo; Severus muttered, feeling a little thump in his chest when he realized how tacky they must seem.&nbsp; How tacky the whole house must look.<br /><br />&ldquo;Somehow I figured that,&rdquo; Lourdes muttered, as she blinked hard, spanning her forehead with one hand to shade her eyes and squeeze her temples.<br /><br />&ldquo;Painkiller,&rdquo; he said suddenly.&nbsp; It had just dawned on him that she might need those more than she&rsquo;d need a bath or tea or anything like that.<br /><br />&ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo;&nbsp; She started gnawing on her lower lip again, eyes downcast and shoulders drawn in so that she seemed smaller, colder - as remote as the moon.<br /><br />Severus felt a sudden surge of anger, though he wasn&rsquo;t sure what to direct it at.&nbsp; Lourdes had just been completely wrung out, and here he sat like an idiot with no idea how to start dealing with it.&nbsp; It was no wonder his face felt strangely numb, his brain throbbed and ears filled with the sound of rushing blood.&nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;It was just pain.&rdquo; Lourdes looked up at him as though she was trying to be serene, to be brave about this. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to tell me to grit my teeth, and be professional about it.&nbsp; It was only ever for the greater good.&rdquo;<br /><br />That notion struck him instantly and instinctively as stupid, though all his logical thoughts tried to override that instinct with reasoning and &lsquo;hard cold facts.&rsquo;&nbsp; Life was a struggle, this was a war, pain was an unavoidable part of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though, facts hadn&rsquo;t ever made it hurt any less.<br /><br />&ldquo;That is the most foolish thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard,&rdquo; he hissed, hand darting out to grab and crush hers, meeting her dispassionate stare with a hard, challenging look. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you that.&rdquo;<br /><br />She didn&rsquo;t look away, but her face softened and her eyebrows drew together in a worried expression that seemed very out of place, given the circumstances.&nbsp; &ldquo;Albus will.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You seem to have confused him with someone else,&rdquo; Severus muttered, and then in a voice so low he was sure she wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to hear it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what he told me.&rdquo;<br /><br />Lourdes eyes sparked up ever so slightly, and there was a familiar tiger-in-the-bushes look about her now so she looked as though she was trying to decide whether or not she had enough energy for an attack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why would he tell you that?&rdquo;<br /><br />Another long silence stretched out between them as Severus recoiled and gripped his teacup with both hands.&nbsp; The silence in the kitchen was tense now, and even though he&rsquo;d fixed his eyes on the damp clumps of leaves in his cup he could <i>feel</i> her watching and waiting.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />What he&rsquo;d mentioned, what he&rsquo;d meant, was not a memory he frequented often, in fact he kept it locked and shoved as far back in his brain as it would go.&nbsp; Just the slightest thought of it sent an eerie prickle racing over his skin and made it feel as though all his organs were moving about independently of one another.<br /><br /><i>A sudden shift in balance.</i><br /><br /><i>Shrieks of hyena laughter in the background, pain somewhere in the flesh but it couldn&rsquo;t rival the overwhelming, rib crushing feeling of humiliation&hellip;</i><br /><br /><i>And hate, rising hot out of his stomach.</i><br /><br /><i>A familiar voice stinging words together &ndash; prophecy, child&hellip;</i><br />&nbsp;<br /><i>Lily.</i><br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Severus said in a hollow voice; he hardly had the energy to turn his nose up at her now.<br /><br />&ldquo;It does to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a hint of smugness in her voice that he recognized.&nbsp; He felt it every time he caught a student in a lie&hellip;&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t buy your story altogether, it was a little too practiced.&nbsp; I knew you, Severus.&nbsp; Sometimes I think you forget that.&nbsp; And you never mentioned pain before.&rdquo;<br /><br />It seemed hard to wrap his brain around the concept of vocalizing the event, the whole chain of events that had lead up to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to find the words seemed awkward, impossible even.<br /><br />&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t tell you.&nbsp; Even if I wanted to,&rdquo; he croaked.<br /><br />&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to I&rsquo;m a good enough Legilimens to see it myself, if you&rsquo;ll let me.&nbsp; I know that this is generally out of bounds, but let me in just this once&hellip; and I&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;<br /><br />When Severus dared to move his head to face her, he saw Lourdes&rsquo; features clouded by a look of grim suspicion.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t tell whether she thought she was not being trusted, or if she thought he was lying again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Every second he had to squirm under that look was one second to long, even though knew he&rsquo;d earned this by feeding her the easy story instead of the honest one.&nbsp; Right now, more than ever, he hated the feeling of his brain clicking into action and making a thousand calculations at top speed - rushing to evaluate the risk of letting her in versus the risk of keeping her out.&nbsp; And the horrible gnawing instinct that seemed to be pressing at his chest that urged him to just get it over with already, to just let her know and be done with it to stop the aching feeling of carrying a very well kept secret&hellip;<br /><br />Suddenly, Severus felt as though he were centuries old and hadn&rsquo;t slept in just as long before he finally surrendered, dropping his head to conceal the fact that his cheeks had seared an ugly brick red.<br /><br />&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;<br /><br />This time he felt her fingers close around his wrist, tugging him forward; all the while it felt like he was moving underwater.&nbsp; After allowing himself to be pulled around in his chair while she scooted forward in hers, Severus felt a strange rush of warmth when her fingers skimmed his face,&nbsp; shoving damp hair behind his ears and cradling his jaw with her hands.<br /><br />&ldquo;Open your eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a very soft request, in a tone as close to gentle as he could expect from her.<br /><br />With what felt like a monumental effort, he complied.<br /><br />-***-<br /><br />It could never be said that Severus ever felt anything lightly.&nbsp; But in adulthood he&rsquo;d managed to conceal this intensity behind a thick fa&ccedil;ade of surly, sneering indifference.&nbsp; Just behind the smooth fa&ccedil;ade he soared to higher highs and sank to lower lows than Lourdes knew possible<br />&nbsp;<br />The only thing she was feeling was how strange it was to be unimpeded as a Legilimens. It wasn&rsquo;t quite like intruding into a memory in a Pensieve, where you dropped in and remained isolated from feeling, accessing only sensory memories, able to take in every perspective. A Legilimens had to deal with the whole story; deciding which feelings, networked memories, sensory input and streams of perception associated with the target thought were profitable, and what meaning could be drawn from the whole experience. If you wanted the truth, or as close as you could come to it in the frailty of human memory, you had to be able to adapt to the unique cognitive processes of every person you encountered.&nbsp; Provide some perspective to biased, flawed memories and leaps in logic. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Trying to process and understand Severus had often proved difficult when they were training at school. Lourdes knew her general lack of emotional intensity was what allowed her to be so analytical, but it also meant she didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;feel&rdquo; as much as her peers. She&rsquo;d always had a difficult time maintaining a good Legilimency connection with Severus if she found a particularly overwhelming memory.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d eventually brought this to use by forcing her to view difficult memories so she&rsquo;d withdrawal in confusion if he couldn&rsquo;t directly repel her.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Was that what he was planning on doing now?&nbsp; Offering her a chance to see, counting that her Legilimency had not advanced far enough to handle a mind like his?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This memory began as a feeling of cold and damp as she found herself on the pavement of an unfamiliar village, the scenery a mere blur and ripple in the memory&rsquo;s continuity.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She only had a moment to adjust when the cloaked and hooded figure of Severus, clutching a black doctor&rsquo;s bag, swept right through her and carried her along as he slipped easily down streets and narrow alleyways towards a particularly old little building.&nbsp; As he walked, she was made painfully aware of a steady stream of thoughts, emotions and sensory information flooding through here as if she were <i>him. </i>&nbsp;In effort to concentrate she dampened them, and for the moment paid attention to sight and sound.<br />The name on the door, which Severus proceeded to quietly probe with his fingers and wand, was &ldquo;Meadowes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seemed to spend an age kneeling on the floor, tense and alert as he unraveled the spells that barred the door and listened for the click of tumblers in the lock before finally being admitted to a flat filled with dim, early evening light.<br /><br />Quiet as a cat, Severus slipped through the rooms, fingers darting out from the folds of his cloak every now and then to skim the handle of a hair brush, pinching the fabric of the robes in her wardrobe with a sort of appraiser&rsquo;s intensity that made Lourdes&rsquo; skin crawl.&nbsp; For the moment she could watch and listen to his thoughts - a logical process of matching and elimination as he made high speed connections between what he knew about his victim, the poisons he had in his bag, and the items he&rsquo;d discovered in her flat.<br /><br />In an instant, Lourdes knew why he was here - assassination, a slippery little poisoner deciding what to taint it with for maximum efficiency.&nbsp; But Severus was all hesitation and lingering doubt&hellip;<br /><br />His long pale fingers popped the latch on his bag, revealing a glittering array of crystal phials filled with liquids the brilliant colors of poison frogs and insects, and envelopes packed with powders neatly sealed and labeled. He&rsquo;d only just touched a phial filled with toxic orange murk when the door handle clicked, and in an instant Severus had the bag closed, his mask down, and his wand out.<br /><br />The woman who emerged from behind the door had a familiar face; Dorcas Meadows had been a very vocal member of the Wizengamot during the first war. She&rsquo;d been known less for her skill as a witch and more for ability to inspire political fervor in even the most dispassionate individuals, and her incredibly irreverent treatment of the Dark Lord.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;d apparently been fast on her feet, even in her old age.<br /><br />Dorcas got the first jab in, or so it seemed; her wand shot off a vivid silver dart that took off through the window, giving Severus just enough time to strike first.&nbsp; Jets of light were soaring across the room in the general direction of each target, shattering furniture and blasting holes in the plaster and boards as Severus seemed to be attempting to move towards the door and Dorcas tried to keep him pinned down in a corner.&nbsp;<br /><br />The cacophony only increased as several other wizards joined the fray and the one on one scuffle quickly turned into a three on one brawl.&nbsp; There was Dorcas, a ferocious looking, bull-necked red head Lourdes recognized as one of the Prewetts, and James Potter&hellip;<br />Severus used the confusion and the clouds of plaster dust as a cover, slithering out on his hands and knees and down the steps at lightning speed. But James Potter was hot on his trail, trying to keep up and keep his wand out of the sight of the Muggles being shoved out of the way as Severus made a beeline for a patch of unkempt grass. Beyond it lay the edge of a scruffy little wood, clearly Severus&#39; destination.<br /><br />He had just enough time to roar out a curse that brought several Death Eaters Apparating to his aide, and just in time too.&nbsp; Dorcas and the Prewett had finally caught up, evening the odds for James, and suddenly the quiet patch of forest was filled with the deafening noises of curses being cast and the blinding light of spells.&nbsp; For a moment the only thing Lourdes could observe was a series of frantic blurs, and that Severus felt too cool, too in control of his actions as he made instantaneous decisions on who to target, trying to predict and steer the fight.&nbsp;<br /><br />He had set fire to the detritus on the forest floor and it was spreading rapidly, to draw the Order away from the conflict by threatening the village.&nbsp; The Prewett jerked around on the spot, screwing his face up as he prepared to attack Severus, who was quicker, and managed to get two hits in: one spell that robbed the Prewett of his ability to speak and a well aimed sectumsempra that cut deep into the tendons of Prewett&rsquo;s wand arm, causing his fingers to go slack all at once.&nbsp; Prewett opened his mouth in a silenced roar, and pressed on without &nbsp;his wand as though he was oblivious to the blood and pain. He turned and slammed his functioning fist into the first enemy body he could find, and Severus took that as a cue to find a new target.<br /><br />That was when he noticed James, who&rsquo;d managed to break through the fire but not without being hit by a stray spell.&nbsp; A bright violet jet of light ripped through James&rsquo; chest and left him prone and twitching like a dying insect as the fire crept steadily in his direction, engulfing James and Severus in a crackling ring.<br /><br />James was right there, and Severus was one killing curse away from disposing of him.&nbsp; But Severus stayed frozen, wand pointed at James, and Lourdes felt three things collide in Severus&rsquo; brain - hesitation, calculation, and a sour, aching hatred growing from a system of vividly recalled memories Lourdes chose not to plumb.<br /><br />Severus&rsquo; eyes met James&rsquo; for a brief second and the only thing that seemed to transmit on James&rsquo; end was pure, abject hatred and a cold flash of fear at the thought of Lily, alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Severus had a cold flash of his own at a sudden realization that brought a lightning fast series of memories; a leering Sirius Black, the whomping willow, and the low growling sound in darkness.&nbsp; And most contemptibly of all, James running to the rescue, a memory which inspired a vicious spike of hatred in Severus&rsquo; stomach.&nbsp;<br /><br />He owed James a life debt, but wanted him dead more than anything.&nbsp;<br /><br />Severus&rsquo; wand hand shook from being held outstretched and immobile for so long and the harsh heavy voice of another Death Eater rose above the sound of the fire and tore through Severus&rsquo; concentration.<br /><br />&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got the drop on us! It&rsquo;s not worth it&hellip; what are you waiting for? KILL HIM&rdquo;<br /><br />Severus&rsquo; mind was nothing but a swirl of images and the idea of forming the words to the killing curse with his mouth, but it was two seconds too late.&nbsp;<br /><br />The ferocious looking form of Sirius Black broke through the fire ring, throwing himself in front of James and sending a full, heavy blast into Severus&rsquo; chest.&nbsp;<br /><br />Things went black.<br /><br /><i>&ldquo;&hellip;mudblood!&rdquo;</i><br />&nbsp;<br />There was a violent lurch and blur of color and time before Lourdes felt another memory blooming in front of her as though she&rsquo;d just opened her eyes.<br /><br />It was unnaturally dark for a place under the wide open sky with the dim lights of a large city casting a wash of light on the horizon.&nbsp; Lourdes shuddered a bit when she found herself confronted by the stony faces of Victorian angels, half shrouded in vine growth,&nbsp; holding inverted torches and looking piteously on the scene unfolding below.&nbsp; She was in a cemetery, a much neglected one by the looks of it.<br /><br />Amongst the ramshackle gravestones packed as close and crooked as teeth stood a mass of shrouded figures hissing and whispering to one another in the dark. They kept a respectable distance from two figures in a clearing encircled by clumps of light that glowed hazy green like corpse candles.&nbsp;<br /><br />The towering form of the Dark Lord glided leisurely around the little clearing, spidery fingers with dirty nails caressing a gaunt, waxy face as he contemplated.&nbsp; Independent of the fear and resentment boiling in Severus&rsquo;s memory Lourdes felt her own brief flash of attraction to what had clearly been an extremely good looking man, and revulsion for having felt it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his original form Voldemort had a horrible sort of magnetism that kept every eye riveted on him effortlessly.<br /><br />&ldquo;It was a simple request,&rdquo; Voldemort said in a tone of practiced nonchalance laced with familiar malice.&nbsp; He seemed to be contemplating the disapproving faces of the gravestones while Severus twitched, eyes darting up every second or so to assess the crowd gathered in the shadows.&nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;Eliminate the threat of Dorcas Meadowes, and leave without a trace. I know you could have done it, Severus.&nbsp; But you didn&rsquo;t and now we must ask ourselves&hellip;why.&rdquo;&nbsp; Voldemort swayed on the spot a little, smoothly drawing a finger over his mouth and putting on an expression of contemplation. The question was rhetorical, of course, and Severus didn&rsquo;t dare answer, and Lourdes shivered at the feeling of teeth that were not hers grinding furiously.<br /><br />&ldquo;I have often wondered, Severus, if you were as worthy of the Mark as Lucius made you out to be.&nbsp; What sort of faithful and obedient servant makes a fool of his master by being&hellip;sick&hellip; in the heat of the moment?&nbsp; Or by hesitating&hellip; Hesitation seems to be your hallmark, Severus.&nbsp; If you hadn&rsquo;t hesitated and lingered Dorcas Meadowes would be dead, would she not?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I did not hesitate,&rdquo; Severus hissed, in a tone dangerously close to a full blown snarl as he continued to kneel on the ground latticed with old tree roots and studded with sharp little rocks.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was not on schedule. In two weeks of observation, Dorcas Meadowes never arrived home earlier than 6 PM.&nbsp; It was her routine.&rdquo;<br /><br />The angrier Severus became, the more cool and pleasant Voldemort acted, as though he was building up to something.&nbsp; &ldquo;More to the point, Severus, is that in the heat of battle, and I mean that quite literally on account of that slippery fire you set, you hesitated.&nbsp; Did you not have James Potter at the end of your wand?&nbsp; And yet you failed to kill him.&nbsp; You hesitated.&rdquo;<br /><br />Lourdes was overtaken for a moment by the high volume of Severus&rsquo; anger - it flashed hot through his body and seemed almost palpable.&nbsp; So much so that the Dark Lord seemed to feel it and pulled back a bit as though he&rsquo;d opened an oven and been surprised by the heat rolling out.<br /><br />&ldquo;Promise, Severus.&nbsp; That is what you had.&nbsp; But you cannot be forever promising, eventually you must produce.&nbsp; And you must do so consistently.&nbsp; I have seen consistency from you, and it is only in the hesitating.&hellip; Do you know, Severus, that now that Dorcas Meadowes is surely in hiding?&nbsp; She is now aware that we know where she lives, and that we will not hesitate to kill her quietly if we cannot make a spectacle of it. &nbsp;And for the moment she is completely lost to us.&nbsp; Of course, that will not prevent her from contributing to the papers and making her opinions known.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voldemort paused again, for effect, heaving a long-suffering sigh before he began to glide like a shark around Severus, pressing the tip of his wand against his fingertips and pursing his lips thoughtfully.<br /><br />&ldquo;Such a chance is lost&hellip; and I will have to finish this work myself.&nbsp; Now I find myself burdened with the task of punishing you.&nbsp; A master should not have to punish his servants so, but it appears these days the world is wanting for competent, dedicated wizards.&nbsp; You really must learn this, Severus.&nbsp; Death Eaters never hesitate.&nbsp; Hesitate, and you risk not only a death at the hands of our enemies, death by the hand of a mongrel Mudblood or a blood traitor.&nbsp; Hesitate and you also receive the wrath of your master.&nbsp; But how best to reinforce this lesson&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />There was another theatrical pause in his indulgent monologue as Voldemort spun manically towards his audience amongst the headstones and made a sweeping gesture.&nbsp; Lourdes took the opportunity to sift through the memory for Severus&rsquo; feelings at the moment and was jarred on the spot by a toxic wave of furious embarrassment and mounting hatred that made her physically sick to her stomach.&nbsp;<br />It certainly couldn&rsquo;t be said that Severus ever felt anything lightly&hellip;<br /><br />Voices from the audience of Death Eaters were reduced to a hissing, twittering chorus of night insects within Severus&rsquo; thoughts as his ears buzzed furiously with numb humiliation and every muscle was rigid with anger.&nbsp; It was as though he felt he couldn&rsquo;t take this shame any more, and then there was a flash of an idea: standing as fast as he could to fire the killing curse at the Dark Lord&rsquo;s back.&nbsp;<br /><br />Who could say he hesitated then?<br /><br />The second that thought flashed white hot across Severus&rsquo; mind, Voldemort stopped reveling in his presentation to the crowd and his monstrous, melted face twisted into a look of feral glee.<br /><br />Suddenly, the world was upside down and there was the horrible pressure of blood rushing rapidly to Severus&rsquo; head, and nothing was visible through the thick swath of black material that had fallen over his eyes.&nbsp; The immersion into thick blackness only heightened the other sensations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Shrieking hyena laughter rippled through Severus&rsquo; consciousness, merging with every instance of laugher at his expense over the course of a lifetime.<br /><br />The only other thing that registered was pain.<br /><br />Lourdes had lost the illusion of control she&rsquo;d had earlier and slipped into the violent rush of humiliation, pain, betrayal, and a feeling of absolute vulnerability that had not dulled in Severus&rsquo; memory over time.&nbsp;<br /><br />She pushed her intruding consciousness through that endless loop of pain to detect serious damage to the part of him that understood the self-non-self divide.&nbsp; His connection to concientia - reality, empathy - was not that of a healthy person. The feeling of safety most people associated with their own identity seemed deeply damaged. &nbsp;Lourdes knew that feeling, when you could not remember if you were human or not, when your mind couldn&rsquo;t cope with pain anymore.&nbsp; It could make you pliable, or too hard to penetrate.&nbsp; And unfortunately for the Dark Lord, the damage he had done to Severus seemed to have rippled across every part of his being, leaving unalterable changes in its wake.&nbsp; Severus had allowed the damage to make his vulnerability and pain into something hard, sharp and unyielding, eager to be wielded and cause its own damage&hellip;<br /><br />There was a stillness in the memory, a buzzing calm where muffled voices could be heard conversing a few feet away.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to strike Severus as important until a vaguely familiar voice cut through.&nbsp; In his haze of pain he could not identify the voice itself, and the body it originated from was hidden in shadow.<br />&nbsp;<br />Lourdes knew that voice though &ndash; it was Peter Pettigrews&hellip;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; his tone was hushed and sly, there was a strange sort of confidence that shouldn&rsquo;t have been in the voice of a coerced traitor.&nbsp; This sounded willing, eager almost.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;What you revealed &ndash; the prophecy, I may know who it refers to&hellip;&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Severus eyes seemed to slit open just enough to see shadowy informant huddled at the Dark Lords feet, alone but for Severus and the stone angels.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;There are two happy announcements among the Order, Alice Longbottom and Lily Potter are expecting&hellip; in about six months time each&hellip;&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Cold fear overtook everything she could feel in Severus &ndash; so intense that she could feel the physical backlash in her own body; the racing heart, rapidly closing throat and the dizzy urge to run like hell.&nbsp; But he stayed still as a corpse and listened.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;It would fit,&rdquo; Voldemort sounded calculating and thoughtful.&nbsp; &ldquo;There were three rather messy incidents with each little pair weren&rsquo;t there?&nbsp; But the Mudblood and Potter...&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />There was a pause there as though he were weighing the Longbottoms defiance against the Potters.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Potters,&rdquo; Voldemort said with startling finality.&nbsp; Severus could see the informant draw back a bit, as if he had not quite expected that answer, and Severus himself seemed to enter a state of heightened panic.&nbsp; Lourdes could see a conversation between Voldemort and Pettigrew-in-shadow but Severus&rsquo; brain was not giving observation priority.&nbsp; It was rushing with thousands of memories and thoughts, and his body was similarly overwhelmed by the weakness and lightheadedness brought by a mixture of fear and desire so intense Lourdes thought she would not be able to tolerate staying in his mind much longer.<br />&nbsp;<br />When Lourdes forced herself to become clear headed enough to follow each thought, each feeling, each memory back she found they traced to a single overwhelming source.<br />&nbsp;<br />Lily.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />But not really Lily as a woman, or a person even.&nbsp; He had made her an icon, an object of singular devotion and veneration&hellip; Seeing it was like entering the Holy of Holies in Severus&rsquo; personal tabernacle.<br />&nbsp;<br />The icon stretched across all corners of his mind like a spiders web, and was unlike anyone who had ever existed.&nbsp; It was frozen and motionless; its beauty was unearthly, perfect, and radiant in the relative darkness of his mind.&nbsp; This object of intense devotion originated from a network of memories which were like examining heavily retouched, highly colored dreams instead of recollections; part reality, part self generated fantasy.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The icon&rsquo;s connections were still there in his present day brain, though degraded and dusty compared to what she could see in the memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some thought or feeling stirred near the icon, feebly as if injured but Lourdes did not have time to examine it.&nbsp; Coming to the icon generated something in Severus &ndash; an overwhelming desire to <i>possess</i>, something more akin to greed than anything else.&nbsp; It was so intense that it drove Severus off the ground and across the dirt and tree roots to Voldemort&rsquo;s feet when his shadow informant vanished.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;My Lord&hellip;Lily&hellip;I&rsquo;ve known her forever and&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; Each word was a desperate prayer and Severus had never seemed so naked, vulnerable or exposed.&nbsp; Voldemort could see everything; every spare moment with Lily on the creek bank, or in the forest.&nbsp; On the playground or stolen in her room riffling through Petunias diary.&nbsp; He could see every dinner eaten with grubby hands at the Evans&rsquo; table, and every sinking and soaring moment Severus had spent with Lily in school. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />And the icon he had made her in to&hellip;<br />&nbsp;<br />Voldmort&rsquo;s eyes seemed to glitter without the benefit of any particular light, and he cocked his head as if this abject display was the most intriguing thing he&rsquo;d ever seen.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;And what would you do, Severus, if I should spare her alone?&nbsp; Kill Potter, eliminate the threat in the child?&nbsp; What would you do for your Lord?<br />&nbsp;<br />There was no hesitation, only an explosion of untempered greedy desire.&nbsp; Lourdes saw no connections to thoughts of what the woman would feel without her child or the husband.&nbsp; No thought to the value of both potentially lost lives.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The ONLY thing Severus seemed capable of thinking of was this imaginary Lily. Not a person anymore, excised and isolated from the rest of the world and all her connections to it.&nbsp; As longed for as heaven and as seemingly unattainable until just that moment&hellip;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; Severus replied.<br />&nbsp;<br />Lourdes hadn&rsquo;t known anything like it.&nbsp; The sheer alienness of what Severus was feeling made her dizzy trying to wrap her mind around it.&nbsp; It was obsessive, it was fervent, it was <i>real</i> to him.&nbsp; His devotion and desire to the icon represented had become a gaping weakness too massive to miss, too firm not to take hold of and manipulate, too singular not to exploit.&nbsp; And despite the fact that it disturbed her, that she knew what he had made was not real, or right Lourdes felt the strange need to protect him for it.<br />&nbsp;<br />That was enough for her, Lourdes pulled away from the whole thing a fast as she could, stomach churning violently and her head feeling tight and spinning wildly.&nbsp;<br /><br />-***-<br /><br /><a href=""http://mementomori-fic.livejournal.com/14746.html"">Continued in Part 2: In Opposition</a></lj-cut><br />"

 <strong>In The Dark</strong></div>
<br />
<em>Moths - petrified and pinned into specimen cases in the office of one of her Professors at Istanbul. She did not try to disguise her disgust for the site. So many creatures of dust and shadow displayed behind glass under artificial light instead of meeting their end on the earth, the wings joining the dead leaves of trees. </em><br />
<br />It stung the sense of undertaker&rsquo;s pride in her. After devoting part of her life to sending flesh and bone back to the elements she knew he didn&rsquo;t have the right to keep those creatures in stasis. Somehow the sight of all those little furry bodies and powdery wings squeezed her damaged heart under the web of gold filaments and made her sick to her stomach.<br />
<br />Smiling a dirty, sharp smile framed by flabby lips, he&rsquo;d described, with a sickening thrill, the process of catching them. The worst part was how he lured his prey- with wildly fragrant night flowers or a glowing bulb in a moth trap.<br />
<br />The things they loved the best&hellip;<br />
<br />
<!--/em-->Lourdes sat up with a start, overwhelmed by the smell of flowers, and skin burning hot as if she&rsquo;d been walking on coals. It was too hot to be sleeping under all those blankets in flannel pajamas. She managed to work off the sweaty pajama top without even unbuttoning it, leaving her considerably cooler in just the undershirt.<br />
<!--!--/em----><br />She froze, and clapped a hand on her stomach. There it was again. That heavy squirm just under her ribcage that had nothing to do with her organs, and though her heartbeat kept the same slow rhythm, it felt&hellip;heavy. It was hard to breathe &ndash; very hard to breathe.<br />
<br />It needed a diagnosis.<br />
<br />Helplessness?<br />
<br />Perhaps; she was over her head in a situation she had almost no experience with. She might have been a better spy for O.H.K. with their rules and regulations, but now she was struggling to balance the scale between the Order and the Death Eaters. Lourdes took another shaky breath to try to stop the frantic squirm and flutter, and wanted to scream.<br />
<br />It was deeply frustrating to be groping in the dark, finding the very edges of whatever the trouble was and being unable to force the problem into a recognizable shape, or get a real feel for it.<br />
<br />How to fix it? She couldn&rsquo;t cure an illness she couldn&rsquo;t diagnose. Alright, if not fix it, how to get a handle on it?<br />
<br />Her brain flashed insistent images of her mother and uncle Chou the apothecary hissing and clucking with disapproval when Lourdes came back scratched and bruised from a tussle with the wrong goat or a black eye from fighting the boys. The first thing they gave her was a cup of tea. When the capture team came limping back and the healers rushed at them, the first thing they jammed in her hands was a cup of tea. Even Albus knew&hellip; tea would help.<br />She needed tea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />Lourdes looked up towards the bed where Severus was tangled up in his bed sheets, muttering fitfully. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a very good idea to wake him up, especially for something as trivial as lighting a fire. He&rsquo;d probably just hex her and roll right back over.<br />
<br />
<em>I can do this alone, </em>Lourdes thought fervently as she eased open the lid of her trunk.<br />
<br />And kill two birds with one stone&hellip;<br />
<br />-***-<br />
<br />
<em>He sees Mum&rsquo;s face, thin and worn from too much worrying and work, screwed up as she tries not to shout or cry. Dad&rsquo;s face is wild as he stoops over her, pointing an accusing finger, his other arm flailing as he screams and bellows. </em><br />
<br />Hot, sticky tears pour down Severus&rsquo; face; fat strands of hair cling to his cheeks as he watches from his corner. His teeth button down on his lower lip so he does not make a sound.<br />
<br />&ldquo;TELL ME!&rdquo; Dad screams, &ldquo;TELL ME HOW YOU GOT THE MAGIC! I WANT IT, EILEEN! HE&rsquo;S GOT IT! I WANT IT TOO! YOU FREAKS CAN&rsquo;T HIDE IT FROM ME FOREVER!&rdquo;<br />
<br />Dad shouts and babbles until he is too tired to scream anymore. Mum is relieved when Dad sits at the table and cries softly instead of yelling, and she makes tea. She asks Dad to take his medicine, but Dad only cries. The mug of Twinings and little pills are ignored. Severus knows it&rsquo;s time for bed, but he clings to Mum after she opens his window to let in cool air.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Severus, Daddy is ill, you know that.&rdquo; Mum&#39;s voice is weary, and as she smoothes the hair away from his face Severus can see that the lines in her face are deeper today than they were yesterday. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t help shouting, he doesn&rsquo;t know any better.&rdquo;<br />
<br />Some days, Dad is better than others. But he&rsquo;s been ill a lot lately, and Severus does not know exactly what&rsquo;s wrong. He only knows that Dad shouted and cried today because Severus was kicked out of school. Two big boys tried to bully him, and the teachers found them against the wall, knocked out with blood in their noses.<br />
<br />He hadn&rsquo;t meant to do it, but he wasn&rsquo;t sorry.<br />
<br />You&rsquo;re magic, Mum explained. A wizard like Mummy is a witch. He&rsquo;d get to go to a special school later with lots of other children just like him. There he can be a wizard all the time, but here he had to keep it a secret.<br />
<br />Severus is very good at keeping secrets now. How ill Dad is, how tired Mum is, how suspicious the neighbors are&hellip;<br />
<br />They are suspicious because the Snapes do not speak to anyone, and because Severus and Dad don&rsquo;t leave the house often. Mum does the work now, at the Chemist, and she doles out little capsules and secret advice about which plants might help along with those pills. Mum keeps so many secrets; the orchids she grows in the secret green house that are sold to the potion companies, the magic books she disguises so Dad won&rsquo;t find them. How they don&rsquo;t have enough money with Dad unwell and out of work so sometimes Mum steals from the till to make ends meet. Severus watches her try very hard not to cry while she sorts through the bills.<br />
<br />Severus stays at home and endures lessons in maths and grammar from Dad before he was too ill. Without fail, Severus wakes up bright and early to make breakfast, cooking the eggs right so Mum has something to eat before she goes to work. Then he sits down for lessons carefully egg-timed, reading everything in the house, getting big books from the library to get ahead in his studies.<br />
<br />It hadn&rsquo;t always been like this; when Severus was very small and Dad took his medicine, they went on a special trip a long way away to the observatory to see the stars, but now the only place Dad takes Severus is to the church when Dad gets scared that devils are banging around in the walls. Severus hates the pity on the faces of the other parishioners, on the face of the priest. What a shame, they all say when they think he can&rsquo;t hear. Tobias so sick and his little child has to take care of him. Where&rsquo;s the mother?<br />
<br />Dad is always scared now. He has been shouting at Mum about money and magic, he wants both. Mum says every night he is just very ill, she uses a big word that sounds funny; Severus does not quite understand what it means. Later he looks the big word up and learns that it means broken mind.<br />
<br />There aren&rsquo;t really devils in the walls; Severus checked. It is only ever the boiler, and Severus fixes it every time it starts to rattle. Dad&rsquo;s mind is broken - Severus hates it. He can fix the boiler when it rattles but he cannot fix Dad&hellip;<br />
<!--/em--><br />
<!--!--/em---->Severus shot up in bed, hand spanning his forehead to pinch his temples. The only light came from the bright full moon streaming through the narrow window, and even that made his head throb violently.<br />
<br />
<em>I should have taken more painkillers&hellip;</em><br />
<br />It was all Potter&#39;s fault really; if it wasn&rsquo;t for those damn Occlumency lessons, Severus wouldn&rsquo;t be having the vicious, lingering headaches and the bad dreams. Lourdes&rsquo; fault, too; if she didn&rsquo;t drink painkillers and sedatives like they were tea he might be able to keep them somewhere other than the locked cabinet in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
<em>One, two, three&hellip;.go ahead, swing your feet out&hellip; </em>Severus felt his whole body, and quite possibly his brain, contract when cold stone floor made contact with his warm feet. With a yawn he eased the bedroom door open and froze.<br />
<br />Something was not right here - there was a fire blazing in the grate and he hadn&rsquo;t set it. Lourdes was kneeling in front of the fireplace in the center of a chalk sigil, the scarred soles of her feet visible, her forearms stacked with heavy amulet bracelets. The sigil&rsquo;s interconnected lines were slowly blackening and sizzling like a spark up a trail of dynamite powder.<br />
<br />Severus blinked hard to clear the sleep out of his eyes while he tried to put all this together. Lourdes couldn&rsquo;t start magical fires.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t any fuel for a real one, and Lourdes would sooner burn herself than burn a book. His eyes blurred briefly as he stared into the fire, and he could have sworn it pulled a face at him.<br />
<br />It must be a demon or an elemental spirit&hellip; No!<br />
<br />People studied this in the Department of Mysteries; they didn&rsquo;t DO it in people&#39;s living rooms. This must just be a dream. He was already in bed, already asleep. Yes. That made sense.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to wake you up. Just go back to sleep,&rdquo; Lourdes said coolly, as if this was nothing more interesting than first year charms class. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s under control.&rdquo; A tendril of flame snaked out of the fire place and around one of the heavy stacks of bracelets, as if the fire was trying to reassure him.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Is that what I think it is?&rdquo; Severus ventured.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Probably. It&rsquo;s called Tngri, and we have arranged a contract.&nbsp; I think you call them heliopaths&hellip;&rdquo; She said that as if it were everyday practice to surrender a witch or wizard&#39;s valuable blood or flesh to an otherworldly creature.<br />But Tngris, as she called them, totaled only ninety nine in existence, and had been coveted, murdered for, and highly prized before they were forgotten.&nbsp; They were not to be tamed like a house elf, each of the known number had a personality of its own, quirks and preferences, different demands it would make of its companion&hellip;never an owner.&nbsp; Like anything elemental, they were wild temperamental magic only tolerated when there had been many more people like her&hellip;<br />
<br />As if to prove what she&rsquo;d said, Lourdes pulled her under shirt away from the soft flesh on her left hip. In the center of a wide, violently purple bruise was the bony top of a fang already half enveloped by healing skin, and a fresh black burn that spelled something in foreign script.<br />
<br />She flicked a finger and the flame wound itself up around her arm and over her shoulders like a stole, taking a sleek almost catlike shape. Little licks of flame flexed like cat-paws kneading in the air as it lounged on her shoulder. &ldquo;See? Friendly as a krup.&rdquo; Lourdes gave him a deeply patronizing look, and the fire light threw her scars and features into sharp relief.&nbsp;<br />
<br />The presence of that magic, or maybe it had been the dreams, made Severus feel uncomfortably young and small even in his own living room.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I needed tea. You don&rsquo;t have any matches,&rdquo; she continued flatly, fingers reaching up to flutter affectionately under the tngri&rsquo;s&hellip; chin before pushing the cauldron holder into place. &ldquo;And I had a feeling you might be a little mad if I burned those first year essays even if they are all rubbish.&rdquo;<br />
<br />As the fire leapt into the grate to start its work, Severus gradually felt the shock wearing off so his face could push into some expression other than slack jawed disbelief. But he could only make little sputtering sounds as there were so many things wrong right now that he couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out what to shout about first.<br />
<br />Taking a slow step forward, he could see something scattered on the floor glinting in the light from the fire place. He sank to his knees to investigate, and discovered the shards of his good ironstone teapot with the spider-web pattern scattered on the floor with neatly quartered fragments of the pile of letters he&rsquo;d left on the table before bed. Not that he could blame her for wanting to shred them, as Severus had wanted to do it when he&rsquo;d read them.<br />
<br />Someone had seen Pettigrew&rsquo;s hand wandering during the roll call and there were quite a lot of nasty comments about Severus losing control of &ldquo;his pet&rdquo; to an apparently weaker wizard.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Did you really need to tear them up?&rdquo; Severus muttered, every syllable ringing painfully in his head as he spoke.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Probably not.&rdquo; She sounded numb.<br />
<br />&ldquo;How were you going to make tea without a teapot?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t quite got to that yet.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Reparo&hellip; And where were you going to get the tea?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t got to that yet either.&rdquo;<br />
<br />Squeezing his eyes shut against the firelight, Severus reached out for the table, setting the repaired teapot and shredded letters down before carefully counting the steps to the kitchen door.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Could you bring some butter, please?&rdquo; Lourdes&rsquo; shout tore through his head as he braced against the wall and fumbled with the incantation to open the cabinet. Three potions and a dish of butter later, Severus wobbled out towards the fireplace and collapsed on the floor next to her, flopping on to his back and covering his eyes with his free hand, leaving just enough space to peek out if he liked.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she muttered. The fire flickered eagerly as Lourdes pricked her finger with her misericorde and counted three careful drops of blood. There was a hiss accompanied by the smell of browning butter and an odd contented noise from the tngri.<br />
<br />&ldquo;When the spell runs out the contract&rsquo;s sealed,&rdquo; she sighed, tugging her shirt back down over the fang and surrounding wounds.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it&#39;s really more of a reunion.&nbsp; Tngri and I are old friends.&rdquo;<br />
<br />The pain in his skull was starting to subside, and from the vantage point on the floor it was easy to observe her. There was no tiger or predator evident in her right now; with her arms wrapped around her knees and tear tracks dried on her cheeks she looked like a child who&rsquo;d lost track of her parents in a crowd.<br />
<br />That forlorn look and the outline of her tightly curled body struck at something in him, and he could feel the odd reverberation all through his chest. Severus had never thought he&rsquo;d see a shred of innocence in a person like Lourdes, with so many deaths on her hands and with absolutely no qualms about tearing open foul creatures or stealing life. But there it was - mixed in with a sort of bare exhaustion.<br />
<br />When everything was stripped off, her training, the education, the hard and lean years there was still something soft underneath, but only just&hellip;<br />
<br />It seemed like fertile ground, something that had rarely been touched by anything, or anyone else.<br />
<br />Lourdes reached up and rubbed her cheeks with the back of her hand, dragging her fingers down her face and neck to rest on her chest. His eyes followed and lingered on the v of flesh and tendons that dipped down into the hollow of her collar bone. His brain flashed a scene for him for just a moment - fingers traveling over the cords and tendons in her neck while her pulse beat under his lips.<br />
<br />No! No, he needed to stay focused.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Ms Mezarci&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
<br />No. Somehow that seemed ridiculously formal for the floor in the middle the night. &ldquo;Lourdes, if you wanted tea, why didn&rsquo;t you just ask?&rdquo; He sounded more exasperated than he felt.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel like waking you up.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I see. So instead you committed the crime of blood-wedding yourself to a fire spirit in my living quarters.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Looked like you were having some interesting dreams, I&rsquo;d hate to interrupt that&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; Severus muttered, trying to keep a cool tone and failing miserably.<br />
<br />She turned and gave him an irritated look. &ldquo;We learned Occlumency together, remember? I know about the rebound dreams, and the headaches. I know that thing with Potter is getting to you. What are you dreaming about?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; he said simply. She&rsquo;d know what that meant if she had any memory at all.<br />
<br />&ldquo;That seems to be an occasion calling for something stronger than a cup of tea,&rdquo; she muttered.<br />
<br />He could hear the water in the cauldron starting to boil and held up a hand to cut her off, leaping to his feet to pull it off the fire. While he warmed the teapot, the tngri amused itself by putting on a little show for Lourdes, who watched it act out a battle between two Tibetan sages.<br />
<br />Summoning a box off the top shelf he began rooting around for the right tea for the occasion. Darjeeling perhaps? No, he found four slightly musty teabags at the bottom of the box. Good old Twinings seemed right about now, and there was some whiskey in the kitchen for his tea.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Moths,&rdquo; Lourdes said quietly when he emerged from the kitchen with the bottle of Old Ogden&rsquo;s.<br />
<br />&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo; Severus let the whiskey pour while he counted to three.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dreaming about them for the past few weeks. But I can&rsquo;t even remember what that stupid Divination textbook said about them.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably for the best,&rdquo; he snorted.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I had a professor who used to collect them and keep them in shadowboxes. The whole concept sort of offends me.&nbsp; May not even mean anything really&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
<br />Severus gave the pot a good stir and took in the cheap, tannin smell he&rsquo;d come to associate with the bagged tea of his childhood. Two lumps went into her cup, one in his. It was a bit of a trick to settle down on the floor with two fat mugs without spilling anything, but he managed.<br />
<br />The moment the tea passed her lips, she looked appeased and disgusted. &ldquo;This tastes&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Cheap,&rdquo; he finished<br />
<br />&ldquo;Yeah, but how did you know how I take my tea?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been here almost nine months,&rdquo; Severus muttered as he eased himself down onto the floor next to her. &ldquo;Give me some credit.&rdquo;<br />
<br />Lourdes paused and gave him that weird contemplative look as if she&rsquo;d only just noticed he was there.<br />
<br />&ldquo;We used to be friends, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she said, in a strangely clinical tone.<br />
<br />Severus froze as he sipped his tea, feeling a little blindsided by that question and the rank burn of cheap whiskey in the back of his throat. Narrowing his eyes and lowering his mug he stared at her exhausted expression warily before he heard a pop and sputter from the fire place. The spell was complete, the tngri&rsquo;s contract was sealed, but it managed one last fluid brush against Lourdes&rsquo; face before it was pulled into the fang on her hip.<br />
<br />It was dark now, and Severus had no desire to light the chandelier - it was just easier when he did not have to worry about controlling his expression, or seeing hers.<br />
<br />There was a rustling and clanking of bracelets as she moved, closer, and he caught a whiff of the perfume she&rsquo;d been wearing since Christmas.<br />
<br />The formula was familiar, because he used to mix little vats of it at St Magdalena&rsquo;s. It smelled like every comforting thing in the world he could remember.&nbsp; There were the orchids and steam in his mother&#39;s green house where he read and dream during the winter months. The luxurious of harvesting essence of gardenia his employer had entrusted to Severus alone, because of his careful technique.&nbsp; The smell patchouli leaves that came packed with the rolls of silk ribbon they used on boxes, and the occasional lavish compliment accompanied by anise scented curry from his employer.&nbsp; All these memories she roused felt like a soft, safe place to be still&hellip;<br />
<br />Would she be the same?<br />
<br />Those bracelets clanked again, and he realized she was so close and it was so dark. He had to work to breathe evenly and he let his eyelids slide shut as if to block everything out.<br />
<br />Oh gods&hellip;<br />
<br />They came in beats &ndash; urgent flashbulb visions.<br />
<br />Hair wound between his fingers. Teeth grazing flesh, tongue tasting salt. Hot rush in the nerves stops the heart cold in the chest for an instant.<br />
<br />The whole concept pulled at his insides and it almost hurt not to touch her.<br />
<br />It was stupid really; this was just inevitable tension between agreeable male and female coworkers in such close quarters.<br />
<br />And moreover, this was Lourdes!&nbsp; Ever since his sixth year, when he&rsquo;d figured out that his Occlumency co-conspirator was a<em> girl</em>, and not merely female, things had been more than a little awkward. After all, she&rsquo;d been there all that time he&rsquo;d been going after Lily, and never once tried to trip him up or stop him.&nbsp; He had never thought to ask Lourdes for anything other than a detailed situation analysis, perhaps for some tricks or gift ideas instead. It would have been absurd to ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />Lourdes had never really seemed&hellip; like a girl.<br />
<br />Not with her self-taught training for the Hit Wizard program, the obsession with the dark bizarre things he liked too, and the fact that he&rsquo;d once seen her knock Mundungus Fletcher&rsquo;s tooth out. She&rsquo;d always just been&hellip; Lourdes. The one who knew.&nbsp; Nothing more, nothing less.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her lectures about Lily&rsquo;s feelings had always been attributed to her preternatural gift for assessing motivation and personality from action, not because she might have some insight generated by belonging to the bizarre tribe &ldquo;girl.&rdquo;<br />
<br />He&rsquo;d tried to keep things simple after he realized Lourdes was one of them.&nbsp; Keeping his distance as vigorously as because there was a fear that if he said the wrong thing, made the wrong move, she would stop being Lourdes and mutate into someone else&hellip; And back then he couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose a valuable asset like a study partner, especially one who might be predisposed to vengeance.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Ever feel like a failure?&rdquo; There was a familiar exhaustion in her voice when she finally spoke up.<br />
<br />Severus&rsquo; brain raced through the scenarios that might cause her to ask a question that loaded&hellip; What had happened last? Pettigrew&rsquo;s hands went where they didn&rsquo;t belong, but she took care of that. She&rsquo;d stabbed the Auror, but that shouldn&rsquo;t have been a big deal for her. Lourdes had only been numb and tired after he picked her up in the woods, it was when she&rsquo;d come back from Albus&rsquo; office that she really seemed angry.<br />
<br />Unwillingly, he recalled every dressing down, every session in Albus&rsquo; office in the slow, tedious process of earning his trust. Albus lectured Severus with the same kindly firmness and cryptic hinting he&rsquo;d used on the students. Those lectures usually seemed like attacks, but Severus had developed tough skin to repel the chiding words like hails of arrows bouncing off stone walls.<br />
<br />Severus&rsquo; problem, he was often told, was his remoteness and an almost pathological lack of empathy that Albus tried very hard to &ldquo;cure.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;This wouldn&rsquo;t happen to have anything to do with your visit to the Headmaster&rsquo;s office would it?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; There was definitely a nasty edge to her voice now.<br />
<br />&ldquo;And what insights did our Headmaster attempt to impress on you? What is your hamartia?&rdquo; Severus placed dramatic emphasis on that last word.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I really understood what he was trying to say.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her tone was cold and evasive just then.<br />
<br />&ldquo;It always is,&rdquo; Severus sighed and had another sip of rank, lukewarm tea.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Do you ever wonder if he&rsquo;s made any mistakes as bad as he thinks ours were?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Not suffocating Tom Riddle in his bed?&rdquo; Severus said bleakly.<br />
<br />&ldquo;That might have solved both our problems. You wouldn&rsquo;t have been a Death Eater, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have ended up in Turkey to drown myself in work.&rdquo; She did something just then. There was the sound of her bracelets rattling again, the mug clanking against the stone, then the pressure of her body sidling up next to his.<br />
<br />-***-<br />
<br />Lourdes heard Severus&rsquo; mug clatter alarmingly when she moved closer. She envisioned the hand reaching to steady the china and thought about the person it was attached to. Severus had good hands - long and pale, calloused and scarred in spots from volatile potions with the deep ink stains on his writing fingers. For a split second it was all too easy to replace the thought of Pettigrew&rsquo;s artificial hand traveling wherever it liked with the idea of Severus&rsquo; moving over her skin in its place. Her breath caught in her throat and her shoulders drew up and in at the thought.<br />
<br />That feeling she knew&hellip; But she had never associated it in her adult life with the rail thin creature next to her. That feeling belonged to other men &ndash; with broad wrestler&rsquo;s bodies, pulpy lips, and short hair who smelled of hammam soap and raki.<br />
<br />It hadn&rsquo;t been easy to keep her feelings away from her bed, or anyone else&rsquo;s, try as she might.&nbsp; Her tongue had a habit of slipping in the dark when she was still light headed.&nbsp; But it was only ever a small betrayal of her real feelings here or there.&nbsp; Lourdes doubted she would be able to stay that remote when it came to Severus. The potential for entanglement, and wanting it, ran far beyond that of limbs. That made Severus dangerous &ndash; it gave him the power to hurt her very badly&hellip;<br />
<br />But still, and unexpectedly, a second thought of his hands on her body shot straight through her and made her short of breath.<br />
<br />Suddenly the shape of that problem she&rsquo;d been struggling to define was alarmingly clear. She felt the same squirm in her gut and heaviness in her heartbeat and short breaths as when she&rsquo;d woken up.<br />
<br />
<em>No. No!</em> This was Severus, he was a coworker and that would be against protocol.<br />
<br />Not that protocol had ever really mattered.<br />
<br />That aside, he wasn&rsquo;t even attractive! Hadn&rsquo;t she just been wondering about that? Lourdes wracked her brain trying to remember what she found so repulsive about him. Teeth could be brushed, hair could be washed.&nbsp; When she allowed herself sideways glances at the pool she&rsquo;d noticed that though he was a bit uneven and bony for his height, he&rsquo;d taken care of himself well.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d actually made his stature a benefit, moving with a lightness and precision a bulkier man could not have.<br />
<br />Closer inspection revealed also revealed interesting things in the details. She didn&rsquo;t need to see his face to recall every inch; she&rsquo;d been studying it over the tops of books for months now. The lines and harsh angles of his face had grown endearing, as had the odd curve and hook of his nose.&nbsp; But the attraction could be attributed to more than just his appearance, there was something to be said about mastery in a field, intelligence, debate, common interest.<br />
<br />This was Severus&hellip; he had known her so well.<br />
<br />Lourdes&rsquo; listened closely for any clues; Severus was trying awfully hard to breathe evenly. &ldquo;So my problem is that I don&rsquo;t have a motivation that Albus approves of. I think,&rdquo; she muttered, glad that he couldn&rsquo;t see her because she must have looked flushed and nervous.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Says he thinks I used my work to avoid reintegrating myself with more important things.&nbsp; As if anyone ever goes into my line of work believing that trumped some philosophical bullshit about saving the world. It&rsquo;s really not worth saving, is it?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Maybe not.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Why are you bothering then? With all this - it&rsquo;s not doing you any good,&rdquo; she said, not bothering to cover up the bitter, selfish bite in her tone.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I want another life.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;What kind?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;You know, I have no idea,&rdquo; Severus snorted.<br />
<br />There was heavy silence for a few more beats as a lingering shock of arousal made her insides squirm. She tried to stay as stiff and unresponsive as he was, unwilling to risk the rejection of relaxing and discovering that he might not reciprocate.&nbsp; Despite the fact that one whole side of her body was snugly nestled against his and the only thing that seemed logical was to get as close as humanly possible for the sheer comfort of it.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I want either,&rdquo; she said at last, swallowing hard afterwards to keep her voice from cracking. Part of it was anger, at an uncertain future. The rest was because she was so close and couldn&rsquo;t quite work up the will to do anything about it. The prospect of aftershock was terrifying.<br />
<br />&ldquo;No more mountains of work, then?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;<br />
<br />-***-<br />
<br />The anger in her voice was so thick he could almost touch it, and Severus knew how much that feeling weighed - he carried it too. The rest of the world and his life seemed to go spinning out of focus, leaving behind the painfully cold floor, and her body radiating delicious heat and heavy anger.<br />
<br />&ldquo;It seems Albus finds a fatal lack of empathy in me,&rdquo; he offered. &ldquo;Or at least, it seems that was what he was driving at.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;You think that&rsquo;s why he made you a teacher? Beat it into you?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;The thought had crossed my mind&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Anyone but him ever show you some empathy?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice was huskier, almost suggestive when she said it, and it made him squirm on the spot.<br />
<br />He froze mid breath again and tried to remember exactly how many times she&rsquo;d said something that stole the air out of his lungs. Empathy&hellip; Albus was pretty much the only one who&rsquo;d ever come close to trying in the years since his sea change.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Not as such.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a pity, but I know how much you hate that&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
<br />Severus closed his eyes, though it was already dark, and tried to imagine exactly what she must look like right now sitting next to him. Her sharp angles, poisonous eyes and lush mouth seemed less like ruined potential and more like harsh, bizarre beauty after all these months.&nbsp; He was able to recall most of the scars streaked across her face, but had no idea where they&rsquo;d come from. He knew about the nine razor scars on her shoulder, one for every time she&rsquo;d given life for an answer from a ghost (he&rsquo;d counted those on occasion to keep from staring elsewhere).<br />
<br />The thought occurred to him again &ndash; his lips against her scars. He could almost hear her pulse, slow and steady despite the situation, unlike his which was loud and frantic.<br />
<br />No.&nbsp; This could be fixed. He could make the hunger go away, and find himself with one fewer ache in his chest.&nbsp; When it finally happened it would feel as repulsive as it had with the scant few other women he&rsquo;d stumbled in to, intoxicated by alcohol and base lust or manipulation.&nbsp; And neither of them would want anything to do with each other afterwards&hellip;<br />
<br />Taking a breath so deep it felt like his lungs might pop, he decided he was going fix this once and for all.<br />
<br />His hand drifted up as he shifted, fingertips counting out each scarred ridge on the meat of her shoulder, sliding across hard collar bone and up to the soft junction of her neck and shoulder. Eyes closed, all he had to do was follow the sound of her pulse before his mouth finally made contact with the spot on her neck just behind her jaw and the world was instantly reduced to the rhythm of her blood rushing under the skin, the overwhelming heat, and the strange blend of perfume and sweat.<br />
<br />There was a soft little sound, her lips parting perhaps, and she leaned into the kiss, pulse speeding up to match his.<br />
<br />More, urged some instinctual part of his brain, he complied automatically, pressing harder and opening his mouth just a little against as he moved down, following the blood rushing to her heart. Her hand found the back of his and there was a flurry of awkward movement.&nbsp;<br />
<br />A realization struck him hard and fast -she wanted this&hellip;him.<br />
<br />He wound up with one arm trapped under her, the other hand nearly crushing her collar bone, and both her hands grasping the meat of his arms to try to take some of the weight off. But he kept going.<br />
<br />About the time he&rsquo;d reached the hard edge of her shoulder the rational part of his brain managed to break through, screaming that this wasn&rsquo;t making the situation any better.&nbsp; Her squirming wasn&rsquo;t an attempt to withdrawal, but an attempt to put herself in a position to reciprocate. He felt an icy stab of fear deep in his gut; fear of the strangeness of this situation, fear because he did not want to stop but did not really know what to do.&nbsp; Severus managed to pull away by sheer force of will and straightened up as fast as he could.<br />
<br />It was much, much colder without the benefit of her warmth pressed snug against him and the world felt strangely alien now. He heard her swallow, hard, and smack her lips nervously.<br />
<br />With his cheeks burning and his brain reeling dizzily, Severus managed to keep himself completely still, waiting for what she might say. Though his judgment of time might have been a little off, it seemed like an eternity since he&rsquo;d touched her, and the reverberation of the sound of her bracelets clanking seemed to last three times as long as it really should have.<br />
<br />Lourdes surprised him this time, reaching out to grab the first thing she could &ndash; his thigh &ndash; and in an instant her hands were at the sides of his head, fingers skipping up his jaw toward his ears.&nbsp; Her mouth, soft and full, brushed his.<br />For a moment everything was a cross between utter confusion at this unexpected development and a desire to give in because it was soft, and warm and promising.&nbsp; Just as soon as giving in may have won, a new horrible and cold thought in the back of his mind expanded suddenly and he froze on the spot.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d started this and he had no idea what would happen if he finished it.&nbsp; After a few seconds, or perhaps it was hours, he felt her pull away.<br />
<br />She gave him hard shove on the shoulders.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t move.&nbsp; She shoved again, and as much as he wanted to collapse and let her carry out whatever revenge she intended, he stayed put.<br />
<br />That was when she hit him, starting with one solid fist to the left side of his chest.&nbsp; Then, a flurry of heavy contact registered, becoming less and less painful as she pounded his chest like a door she was refused entry to. He made no move to defend himself.&nbsp; Finally, his elbows buckled and it was all he could do to keep his head from bouncing on the tiles as she collapsed into him and groaned.&nbsp; They lay in silence for a moment, motionless with her face buried in his robes and both fists in tight knots.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I hate this.&rdquo;<br />
<br />It came out as a snarl, and ended as a whimper.&nbsp; Her fists relaxed and she went limp.&nbsp; Severus had no idea what she meant by this.&nbsp; But her weight on top of him offered too many possibilities he could not entertain now. Whatever had just happened was already gone.<br />
<br />Severus had thought about this a few times, what it might be like to be this close, and presumably this trusted. Despite the fact that he could easily wind his arms around her, there was still the strangest tension that kept them a little more distant than he would have liked&hellip;<br />
<br />A few more moments of taut, awkward silence passed, and he reached up to stroke the nape of her neck in an attempt to comfort her.&nbsp; He did not dare try anything else. It took a moment before his heart slowed down to a normal pace and he could pretend this was completely normal and not at all tempting.<br />
<br />But it was tempting.&nbsp; For a few seconds there everything had vanished. The war was gone, the Dark Lord was gone, Albus was gone.&nbsp; His students, this castle, the entire world, and that strange pang of hunger that had nothing to do with his stomach just&hellip;vanished. He wanted to remember exactly how it had felt but it was getting harder by the second&hellip;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Any news from the others?&rdquo; she asked weakly.&nbsp; There was some comfort in her asking for mundane news about the Death Eaters.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Nothing. Not yet.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;And Potter - any progress with the lessons?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Definitely not.&rdquo;<br />
<br />-***-<br />
<br />She did not move.<br />
<br />Some part of her she could not quite name ached, and she was infuriated by how good it had felt.&nbsp; The instant she had reciprocated Severus had seemed to realize what a terrible and dangerous idea it had been, and froze.&nbsp;<br />
<br />And here they were.<br />
<br />Sitting next to him in the dark she might have imagined him to be anyone.&nbsp; But here, the stark hardness of his bony, ropey ascetic&rsquo;s body under hers meant he could not have been any of the others.&nbsp; She could smell him, aseptic potions, sweat and dirt, and hear his heartbeat.&nbsp; She could not fool herself.&nbsp; This was Severus, and he had pulled her in and pushed her away in the span of a minute.&nbsp; In that brief flicker of time she&rsquo;d been lifted higher and fallen further than she had in years.<br />
<br />&ldquo;So where are we going from here?&rdquo; she managed.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Damage control,&rdquo; Severus replied firmly. He shifted uncomfortably underneath her, and she heard his mug grind against the floor.<br />
<br />His hand twitched against her neck and her brain responded automatically by spinning out another daydream of heat, rhythm and pressure. It was too satisfying a sequence of thought to ignore and Lourdes squirmed a little, rolling over and using him as a pillow. Severus didn&rsquo;t stop touching her though, his fingers switched to repetitively tracing the jagged edge of her ear instead of her neck.<br />
<br />&ldquo;&hellip;more letters I suppose.&rdquo; Severus&rsquo; voice drifted back into focus just then.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Letters?&rdquo; she muttered.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you paying attention?&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;No, not really.&rdquo;<br />
<br />He responded with a little indignant grunt and she could imagine his face twisting into an annoyed sneer.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Who did that to your cheek?&rdquo; he said at last, voice kept low and too even.<br />
<br />The question yanked her firmly out of the warm, dreamy little cloud she&rsquo;d been enjoying and reminded her that 18 years had passed since their time at Hogwarts. She&rsquo;d had a job, lost it, been in jail and on the edge of respectability and bore the marks where anyone could see them - and wonder exactly where they&rsquo;d come from.<br />
<br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a little out of the blue,&rdquo; she sighed.<br />
<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask.&rdquo;<br />
<br />I&rsquo;ll bet he has&hellip; she thought darkly. The anger was a little helpful; it was something hard to hold on to.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Ozymandias doesn&rsquo;t employ Dementors. They prefer their cruelty to be cultured, and with brains. When O.H.K. wanted to send an agent in to talk to me about a serial killer who was stalking families, I refused on principle and sent him out half dead. They decided to see if the Master of Confessions could persuade me. They started here&hellip;&rdquo; She reached up for his hand and guided it&nbsp; the scar extending from the outer corner of her eye.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s just say the Confessor does not appreciate it when you don&rsquo;t cry or scream, sort of takes the fun out of it for him. I think it hurt, but I don&rsquo;t really remember. I just sort of concentrated and waited for him to be stupid enough to make eye contact with me. He did it right about here&hellip;&rdquo; she pressed his fingers to a trench on a soft spot on her cheek dangerously close to her lips. &ldquo;I just dove right in and drug up every rotten memory I could find - sent him off in a vomiting panic. And they were clever enough not to come calling after that.&rdquo;<br />
<br />***<br />
<br />Without even thinking about what he was doing, Severus let his fingers race back to the jagged edge of her ear, attempting to ignore the fact that she was leaning into the touch entirely too eagerly. His brain was urging him in the opposite direction though, down the curve of the neck, over the hard ridge of the collar bone to seek something softer&hellip;<br />
<br />&ldquo;Who did that to your ear?&rdquo;<br />
<br />She let out a short, bitter laugh. &ldquo;On my very first collar with the capture team, we went in to bust a vampire and some psychotic Muggles who wanted to be vampires, and I was the first one in. It was the stupidest rookie mistake, I caught one of the Muggles in the chest with an elbow and tackled him from the front, and well, I got his arms pinned down but that didn&rsquo;t stop his teeth. Got me in the ear and on the cheek. Everyone was very impressed that I didn&rsquo;t cry when they told me they weren&rsquo;t going to be able to reattach it. I tell you though; I never made the mistake of hitting from the front again.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have any scars then? In spots acceptable for social viewing?&rdquo; Lourdes yawned.<br />
<br />That question froze his heart in his chest. He&rsquo;d worked hard to keep his skin completely unmarred, daubing on oceans of dittany, giving all his wounds with every conceivable treatment he could to remove all evidence. But there had always been the one mark he couldn&rsquo;t get rid of.<br />
<br />&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; he managed.<br />
<br />&ldquo;No fair. And here I thought you were going to be honest.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;<br />
<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll need proof,&rdquo; she muttered, in a playful tone garbled by a yawn.<br />
<br />Snorting a bit, Severus muttered something about taking his word for it and fidgeted, trying to come up with something to follow that with.<br />
<br />&ldquo;You need to get to bed. You&rsquo;re supposed to teach in the morning.&rdquo; She sounded weary and annoyed this time.<br />
<br />&ldquo;It would be best,&rdquo; he said, relieved for a reason to take some of the heat off the situation.<br />
<br />When Lourdes extricated herself from the tangle of limbs, his skin prickled where she&rsquo;d been pressed against it as if his whole body objected to her absence.&nbsp; Any time he had gone to bed with a woman, he&rsquo;d slipped out the door as soon as he finished.&nbsp; He never stayed the night, and hadn&rsquo;t wanted to. Part of him already seemed to know how satisfying it would be to sleep with her nestled against him, warm in a little cocoon of blankets after all was said and done.<br />
<br />There was, of course, the frightening possibility that Lourdes would want to&hellip;talk about it. Know what it meant. How could he tell her something he didn&rsquo;t know?<br />
<br />&ldquo;Lumos.&rdquo; Severus winced automatically at the dim light of his wand tip, and watched Lourdes struggling to her feet.<br />
<br />He was only too happy to put one hand on the small of her back to guide her when she started stumbling.&nbsp; And to give her another sedative without being asked, so she would be asleep, unable to talk about what just happened.<br />
<br />She collapsed into her bed un-aided, and fussed with her blankets until she&rsquo;d spun herself up in them again. While he watched her fall asleep, feeling vaguely seedy for it, a skirmish broke out inside him. Something raw and demanding fighting the rational part violently and it made him dizzy as he plodded over to his own bed, which looked like a vast desert wasteland right now. Severus ran an inventory of what he&rsquo;d need to do in the meanwhile to keep his mind off her as he stared at the wooden bed top.<br />
<br />The seedlings for the summer garden at Spinner&#39;s End needed to be started so he could plant as soon as it was warm enough.<br />
<br />There were piles of essays to mark.<br />
<br />Someone had to start the preliminary research for the Cruciatus formulas.<br />
<br />He owed Avery a very, very nasty letter&hellip;<br />

But in a fight she was a viable opponent, a real thinking, fighting target, Pettigrew&rsquo;s treatment made her feel distinctly like an object.&nbsp; <br /><br />But then again everything made her feel like an object these days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lourdes&rsquo; every nerve was frayed and raw; her skin felt hot as if she was running a fever. The only thing she wanted to do was to finish washing up before going to bed.&nbsp; But there was a brief to deliver.&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt worn and sore on the inside.&nbsp; <em>The feeling isn&rsquo;t real</em>, she thought dismissively, as she squeezed her eyes shut and turned the water up, it&rsquo;s just the after effect.&nbsp; The cold stream stung sharply when it hit her skin, but she didn&rsquo;t particularly mind.&nbsp; Fresh pain meant everything was back where it belonged, even if the slapdash reinstallation of her soul left the mind and body raw.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once Lourdes had donned her oldest, softest jeans with the holes at the knees and a snug T shirt, she found a few bloody little finger prints on the towels and her waistband.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d scrubbed so hard at her nails in the shower that all the little cuts on her fingers had broken open.&nbsp; <br /><em><br />I&rsquo;ll clean up later</em><br /><br />When Severus discovered the mess left on his towels, he&rsquo;d insisted on sealing up each small cut with his wand rather than leaving her body to its own devices.&nbsp; While he went about his work, he cradled her injured hand in the palm of his own- which was clammy and shaking a bit more than usual as he went about his repairs.<br /><br />Repairs- just the same way it had been at O.H.K. where the healers had rushed to her first on her superior&rsquo;s command.&nbsp; Not because they particularly cared about her well being, but because they could not risk losing their Evocator.&nbsp; Maintenance- that&rsquo;s all this was, she thought blandly.&nbsp; There was a sudden sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu &ndash; that this scenario had already played out and it had not ended well for her.&nbsp; <br /><br />From where she stood now everything looked as though it was lining up with past events; the strange stirrings of desire borne out of work and close quarters, the danger of being involved with a coworker who might not be good for her, hanging herself with her own ambition, and a commander who might have to leave her in prison if she were caught carrying out his orders&hellip;<br /><em><br />It&rsquo;s just the shock and the Pettigrew thing.&nbsp; Your perspective is a little skewed</em>&hellip; she reminded herself.<br /><br />Severus spent the next few minutes browbeating her into taking a dose of painkillers.&nbsp; She only listened to half of what he said as most of it had to do with her &ldquo;bravado&rdquo; and &ldquo;pig headedness,&rdquo; and those were the nice accusations.&nbsp; After a few minutes of trying to ignore him, she downed the goblet he was shoving under her nose in one gulp and followed with a rather rude hand gesture.<br /><br />That shut him up.<br /><br />Whatever sort of painkiller it was, it made her body feel as numb as the opium did, but her mind was nowhere near as calm as she took the long dark walk up the Head of House passage to give her report to Albus.<br /><br />When Albus flung open the door to meet her, the office was filled with the buzzing, clicking, and whirring of the once-dormant instruments in his cabinets finally at work.&nbsp; His expression was tense, and there were none of the usual niceties, jokes, and offers of sweets.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was serious.&nbsp; Lourdes did her best to adapt, and used her most straightforward, cool tone to deliver a fairly coherent report of the events.&nbsp; And then, all she could do was brace herself and take a deep breath, unsure of what sort of response he&rsquo;d give.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had most definitely not anticipated a look of deepest disappointment from him.&nbsp; <br /><br />All the air left her lungs at once as suddenly as if she&rsquo;d fallen flat on her back. <br /><br />He was the closest thing to a commanding officer here, she thought frantically, he was duty bound to support her unless she&rsquo;d broken protocol! Only there wasn&rsquo;t any protocol, she thought as a familiar icy panic took over and her skin broke out into a cold sweat.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&ldquo;The Auror, is he all right?&rdquo; she asked as coolly as she could, to get things rolling and over as soon as possible.&nbsp; Her hand ran over her stomach to the spot where she&rsquo;d had to stab him.<br /><br />&ldquo;Kingsley and Tonks report that he was quickly mended.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;The Ministry, have they said anything about it yet?&rdquo;&nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;No, not a word from any corner.&nbsp; They aren&rsquo;t rushing to the Wireless to alert the public.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been keeping watch,&rdquo; Albus gestured heavily to a stream of tickertape spewing from a heavily modified wireless unit.<br /><br />&ldquo;The Death Eaters are free, and I fear we&rsquo;ve merely reinforced Tom&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t know yet if this is going to force Cornelius to come to terms with what is happening.&nbsp; I fear that this was a mistake.&nbsp; But what is done is done,&rdquo; he finished in a dead sort of voice.&nbsp; <br /><br />He looked up at her with that disappointment again and sighed.<br /><br />Lourdes felt the grip of pure, cold fear when she was sure that disappointment was because of her.<br /><br />Visions of Hashim dressing her down with the same disappointed expression raced through her brain, and she connected that feeling, that look, with the here and now.&nbsp; This was how Hashim had started to wear her down&hellip; and it wasn&rsquo;t long before she was trying &ndash; desperately - to make up for every perceived mistake.&nbsp; Lourdes always stood still and stony to hear the accusations, and the disappointment, swallowing every one of her objections to keep her job.&nbsp; The only way she could fight that disappointment, warranted or not, was to learn all the rules and play by them, even when Hashim was just making them up as they went along.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here there weren&rsquo;t any rules, any standards; it wasn&rsquo;t her fault if she broke rules she didn&rsquo;t know about!&nbsp; And&hellip;if she didn&rsquo;t know the rules, what was she doing here?<br /><br />&ldquo;I need a reason,&rdquo; she heard herself say in a cold, hard voice she hardly recognized.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me a reason to put up with this from you. To have to go out there with those people like I&rsquo;m one of them, and then have you look at me like I&rsquo;m really am, like I failed!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m NOT one of them Albus, I never have been.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Because you promised that you would.&nbsp; You value your word.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those words fell flat in the space between them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oaths, vows, department contracts, she&rsquo;d put faith in all of them, and they&rsquo;d all fallen from underneath her. She had this conversation before and it had ended with the same words.<br /><br /><em>Because you swore the oath &ndash; protect and serve.&nbsp; What we&rsquo;re asking is part of that&hellip;<br /><br />&nbsp;Fuck this.</em>&nbsp; <br /><br />Never in her entire career had Lourdes stood up to a commanding officer.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d spent years thinking that the organization must know best.&nbsp; In return for obedience, they were supposed to catch you when you fell carrying out their orders.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d sent her to prison instead&hellip;&nbsp; Albus would have left her there at Azkaban, the way he&rsquo;d left Podmore.&nbsp; The way Hashim had left her in Ozymandias!<br /><br /><em>You can&rsquo;t trust any of them.&nbsp; <br /></em><br />She was going to settle this now, make it known that she would not go quietly. <br /><br />&ldquo;I expect to take hits in the field, sir, that&rsquo;s part of my job.&nbsp; But what I don&rsquo;t expect is to be dressed down like this for completing my task, inflicting as little harm as possible and avoiding capture.&rdquo;&nbsp; She forced the words out in a cool, crisp tone, but the top of her throat was closing up tightly.&nbsp; It was very hard to breathe.<br /><br />Albus seemed to be composing a response, and Lourdes had no proper concept of how long it had been since she&rsquo;d spoken.&nbsp; It felt like an eternity.&nbsp; Striking forward like a snake, she spat old fear and new anger.<br /><br />&ldquo;What was I supposed to do? You don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; she hissed, slamming her hands on the desk.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You would have left me there if they&rsquo;d caught me!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d leave us both if you thought it would damage your credibility to have to fish us out, wouldn&rsquo;t you? You left Podmore! Wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone to know you&rsquo;ve got an Evocator up your sleeve, worried about how that might make you look aren&rsquo;t you? You just get rid of things when they get too complicated don&rsquo;t you? You got rid of me!&nbsp; Just the same way he did&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />She paused, and felt her mouth gape open, hearing the crackle of a thousand connections making themselves in her mind.&nbsp; The room, Albus, even the air went hazy as her brain shifted into over drive, and time as she knew it warped so that past and present seemed to slam together.&nbsp; Lourdes dropped back into her chair, things she&rsquo;d been avoiding for ages were now demanding attention, trying to tell her the same thing at a volume so high she could not make the message out.&nbsp; <br /><br />She could just barely tell that his face had rearranged into an expression that seemed sternly sympathetic.<br /><br />&ldquo;You must&hellip;accept my apology, Lourdes,&rdquo; he said, in a strong, kind voice that cut through her swirling panic easily.&nbsp; One wand tap on the desk later, the samovar appeared.&nbsp; Albus poured a glass and sent it floating in her direction.<br /><br />When her free hand shot up to wrap around the warm glass, it felt like a handle on reality.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Tea made sense, but his apology?<br /><br />&ldquo;Apology?&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp; She had no idea where this was going, but had the distinct feeling that she would not like it.<br /><br />&ldquo;After I, as you say, got rid of you, I petitioned for your acceptance to the police program through MKIP.&rdquo; He gestured to her Police Academy T-shirt before continuing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had imagined you would be very good at any job you chose.&nbsp; I had no idea where it might take you, or who you might meet there.&nbsp; I knew that after some years you had achieved your ambition to pursue the psychological end of investigation.&nbsp; But as much as you have learned about the mind, as much as you already knew, I am alarmed to discover how little you know of your heart.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The heart hasn&rsquo;t got much of a place in my line of work.&nbsp; Objectivity gets the job done,&rdquo; she said automatically.&nbsp; Although she was not sure she meant it, it was just&hellip;what she always said.&nbsp; She maintained objectivity on so many of her investigations, because so few of them touched her.&nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;If objectivity was your sole modus operandi, Lourdes, I could not have brought you here.&nbsp; I will not employ mercenaries.&nbsp; You know all about motivation, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Albus asked, in the coolly curious tone she knew all too well.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was an interrogators tone.&nbsp; &hellip;<br /><br />&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; she replied in the most even, passive voice she could muster.&nbsp; Almost unconsciously she felt every other thought every other feeling drain and dampen so her mind was nearly blank, and calm.<br /><br />&ldquo;Why did you start in the Special Operations and Security unit when you began work after your time with M.K.I.P. in Ankara?&nbsp; There were so many other divisions you might have chosen from when you received you certifications&hellip;why pick the most dangerous one?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I hate desk jobs, and S.O.S. didn&rsquo;t mind if I couldn&rsquo;t use a wand.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;And again, when you were selected for Ozel Harp Kuluru, to rescue and then to investigate? Why did you take a high stress, low pay civil servants job with such a high potential for injury?&nbsp; Immersed in the worst the world had to offer you when there were so many other avenues for fame or rewards you may have taken, given your skills and your history?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The job suited me,&rdquo; Lourdes said simply. &ldquo;I like puzzles,&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;And yet you never do the crossword,&rdquo; Albus said shrewdly. <br /><br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my kind of puzzle.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I suppose you are right.&nbsp; Your line of work brought you a lot of things did it not?&nbsp; Long hours and countless resources invested in the apprehension of a single person.&nbsp; Weeks of carry away food and very long nights I suppose.&nbsp; Not a job most would choose no matter how much the like puzzles.&nbsp; So I wonder Lourdes why you picked this kind of puzzle?&rdquo;<br /><br />His tone was maddeningly gentle just then, as if he were a parent asking the child where they&rsquo;d gone wrong&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;It was always to survive. I had to make a living. There was no shame in doing something I&rsquo;m good at.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lourdes could never really say exactly why she was good at it, but she knew why she liked it.&nbsp; She had picked dangerous jobs that fed her most instinctual curiosity, or her need to do something she could account for at the end of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp; The money never mattered, she had never been unhappier than when she had to simply deal books, though she&rsquo;d never had been richer.&nbsp; When she was at OHK, in either division, she had been as happy as it was possible to be when your life revolved around work. <br /><br />No one questioned her skill as an investigator as they had her magic. If she simply played by the rules and kept her nose clean, the job was supposed to bring her praise and excitement; achievements she had thought could not be killed or taken away.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;The job, in many ways, suits the best and worst aspects of you perfectly,&rdquo; Albus interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, when I apologized I meant to say that I am sorry for having taken away your reason, as you say.&nbsp; I suspect that after you realized you could not have your families back, you worked because it was the only thing that made you happy, and the things the job would bring to you are not as easy to lose as people.&rdquo;<br /><br />There was an urgent, beckoning quality in his expression now, as if he was standing a mile ahead waiting for her to catch up.&nbsp; Or perhaps he was waiting with baited breath for her to take just one more step. <br /><br />&ldquo;I liked my job, I liked being good at it&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused and took a deep breath, now keenly aware that she was about to put a foot down in a trap of sorts.&nbsp; Lourdes squeezed her eyes shut, anticipating the pain of being caught. <br /><br />&ldquo;But the motivations and assurances that drove you day to day before must not satisfy you here as they did before.&nbsp;&nbsp; You said it yourself not moments ago, you have completed all the tasks myself and Voldemort have set you on.&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve completed them well, even without the full benefit of Severus&rsquo; help.&nbsp; If excelling at the work is enough, why have you asked me for a reason?&rdquo;&nbsp; He raised his eyebrows expectantly and tented his fingers.<br /><br />She didn&rsquo;t answer, her brain was throbbing and wasn&rsquo;t really in any shape to be playing mind games.<br /><br />&ldquo;You already have your reason Lourdes, though right now I wonder if you realize it.&nbsp; And I wonder who you might be, with your skill and your drive, if had I not taken you away from my brother, from your friend,&rdquo; he replied in a gentle sort of voice.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t change the subject. If you&rsquo;re not going to support me when I follow your orders through without fail then there&rsquo;s no way I can do this. I&rsquo;m not going back to jail because of bad orders or another change of heart&hellip; So give me a reason,&rdquo; she said darkly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Let us speak frankly - there was no great reward for you here and you knew that in coming.&nbsp; Even though you were correct those months ago when I presented you the task of working with Severus.&nbsp; You did not have to fight, spy, or follow any order once your contract was broken.&nbsp; But here you are.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you come Lourdes? Everything you won before was taken away, even though you sought it out because you believed it could not be lost. &rdquo; There was that look on his face again, waiting for her to catch up&hellip;<br /><br />&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t all I wanted!&rdquo; Lourdes&rsquo; hands froze in mid air as if she were trying to clutch something.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wanted&hellip; to do something that made me happy.&nbsp; What did I have left but work?&nbsp;&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t work, I slow down.&nbsp; If I slow down I have time to think about all the things I don&rsquo;t have because you took them away.<br /><br />&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not pretend you brought me here because you want me happy!&nbsp; You brought me here because of what I am, not who!&rdquo;&nbsp; Those last words were embarrassingly childish and spiteful, but she&rsquo;d said them and they could not be taken back.<br /><br />&ldquo;You know that isn&rsquo;t true Lourdes.&nbsp; Though you are one of a handful of what you are, as you say, there are a hundred other things I might have done instead of recruiting you if I were only concerned about the &lsquo;what,&rsquo; and not the &lsquo;who.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have already told you that what I value most is your skill and knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish me to give you a reason, let us follow your old pattern and say the reason is to work.&nbsp; Work with us, keep your mind off the things you think you do not have.&nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;But I cannot pretend that I don&rsquo;t pity your unhealed wounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there no one in Turkey who you could have loved, or made family?&nbsp; Or did you hesitate and distance yourself because you feared loosing anyone you might grow to love?&nbsp; Drowning yourself in work and its rewards would have kept you safe from that particular sadness, but I fear it also made you as miserable as ever in the end. When you asked what I could give you in return I offered you very nearly anything.&nbsp; The only thing you asked for was to come home.&nbsp; Is that not reason enough?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s your responsibility to find out if you have the strength to embrace the things you fear losing, or if you would prefer to remain in the same path that&rsquo;s kept you safe though unhappy&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />Albus exposed her without pity, and it struck her with dizzying force to have her fa&ccedil;ade stripped away so quickly.&nbsp; He knew she had nothing to stand on anymore, that she had lost everything&hellip;&nbsp; Her hand flew instinctually to the spot where the demon wound had been.&nbsp; She was alarmed to find it closed up, even though it had been that way for months now.<br /><br />&ldquo;We have all been damaged, Lourdes, but some of us have found courage enough to heal.&rdquo; There was a strange tightening in her gut, as her brain flashed images of the old raw wound and connected them to Albus&rsquo; words- she had not healed on her own, she had no courage&hellip; <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a coward,&rdquo; she said shakily.&nbsp; It was true; she&rsquo;d faced every task that had been laid in front of her without flinching, hadn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; She&rsquo;d taken the Dark Mark, looked the Dark Lord in the eye, and stormed the Dementors without a flicker of cowardice&hellip;<br /><br />&ldquo;You do not shy away from a task when you know you have control,&rdquo; he said firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve yet to discover the courage it takes to have faith in anything other than your mind and protocols.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve only seen the worst of what people, yourself included, can do Lourdes.&nbsp; For that, I am sorry.&rdquo;<br /><br />That was the last thing he said to her before he quietly guided her to the passage door, gently prying the empty tea glass out of her hand before dismissing her with the air of a disappointed parent.&nbsp; In the tunnel, on her way back down to Severus' quarters, Lourdes felt a sick wave of claustrophobic panic.&nbsp; She hit the wall and sank to the floor, wobbling on the balls of her feet before she fell all the way down.<br /><br />Everything in the world was wrong now.&nbsp; Albus had just exposed a weakness and wounds she had doggedly ignored.&nbsp; <br /><br />He was manipulating her, she thought frantically.&nbsp; All this garbage about courage and the worst in people was just slapping a thick coat of rhetoric on a rotten structure.&nbsp; Albus was just like anyone else- he just wanted to win, didn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; Who did he have in his life? An alienated brother?&nbsp; Distant colleagues? He was as much a hermit in a tower as she was!<br /><br /><em>You only see the worst in people&hellip;</em><br /><br />There was a dizzy flash of heat somewhere in her brain and she felt an airless panic and anger trapped in her chest.&nbsp; <br /><br />How to get it out?&nbsp; <br /><br /><em>Scream.&nbsp;</em> She didn&rsquo;t feel like arguing, so she forced herself up on her elbows and bellowed at the top of her lungs with the reminder that this was a dungeon; it had been built to contain noise like that&hellip;<br /><br />She kept it up until her throat was raw and her stomach hurt from sheer tension.&nbsp; It was the simplest thing in the world to do right then, an easy outlet for unfamiliar feelings. Afterwards things felt a little lighter- as if just enough pressure had been relived to keep her from exploding.&nbsp; Lourdes slid down back down to the floor again.&nbsp; Everything felt alien right now, her body, her brain, this damp tunnel.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thoughts began to run muddy.&nbsp; It was hard to separate one feeling, one thought, from any other.&nbsp; The chaos did not sit well with her&hellip;<br /><br />She tried an Occlumens trick to right herself; reorganize, separate, sort.&nbsp; Pulling an old thought out of the mess slowly to feel it again- Aberforth was the first live thing to surface.&nbsp; Aberforth in the third summer she&rsquo;d spent with him, fussing over a boom of springtime kids.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d all been weak that year, born too early when it was too cold.&nbsp; They spent the evenings swaddling, medicating, and keeping the poor creatures warm.&nbsp; <br /><br />She could remember holding squirming bundles wrapped in flannel, tiny goats with floppy ears and a velvet soft muzzle grazing her chest as the kid moved its head around looking for a familiar sound - a heartbeat.&nbsp; There was something good.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was a reason- her surrogate father who&rsquo;d shown her how to be a surrogate to the goats, she could work to protect that.&nbsp; She held on to that notion and thought harder about other good things she could remember:&nbsp; her favorite patrons of the Hog&rsquo;s Head, the memories of her parents, and the once-close friend she&rsquo;d had in Severus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Severus&hellip; that was lost now wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; She&rsquo;d destroyed any chance of moving closer into orbit with him when she&rsquo;d attacked him months ago. It wasn&rsquo;t as if she could expect forgiveness given all that she&rsquo;d said, and what she knew about him.&nbsp; Thinking of Severus suddenly made her insides move like eels in a tank because nobody ever knew, and Aberforth only suspected, how quickly she&rsquo;d come to be infatuated with him after they started doing lessons together.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />It was hard not to get close to someone when you routinely broke into their mind and had access to the memories and thoughts that shaped them.&nbsp; Lourdes had seen all sorts of things in Severus; beautiful memories from very early years with his parents when they were still healthy, the frightened feelings of being too small to fix the problems that made life slide down hill-&nbsp; all the things that made him who he was.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d seen the same things in her mind - she hadn&rsquo;t learned to hide herself then.&nbsp; He saw who she was and stopped seeing what she was.&nbsp; <br /><br />Severus was, like it or not, the one living person who knew more about her than anyone else.&nbsp; It was frustrating in a way to know that she couldn&rsquo;t control the way he saw her.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t execute the task of moderating every second of her behavior and every possible external cue in her life to convince him&nbsp; that she was icy, strictly work minded, or completely uninhibited, unattached and that she won every time.&nbsp; He already knew who she was, as did Albus, and there were precious few places to hide from the two of them now.<br /><br />Once she&rsquo;d dragged herself back to Severus&rsquo; quarters, she ignored him doggedly and went straight to the bedroom.&nbsp; She was feeling too raw and too exposed to bear contact with anyone but herself right then, and was perfectly content to lick her wounds in privacy like an animal.&nbsp; She lay in bed on her back in the dark willing herself to fall asleep, but there were no case files to read, and no research projects that needed her attention.&nbsp; The utter absence of anything to take her mind off the situation made her frantic.<br /><br />She&rsquo;d crack, Lourdes thought, if she couldn&rsquo;t just get to sleep.&nbsp; Quiet as a ghost, she rummaged through his nightstands and under his mattress for anything that might put her down.&nbsp; A thorough search of the bathroom yielded nothing either.<br /><br />The last resort was that Baku Philter Severus had given her ages ago, and had not taken away the last time she tried to sleep through her anger. She drank a quarter of the bottle in one go, leaving her with hardly enough time to re-cap it before she dropped heavily onto Severus&rsquo; massive bed with one of her pillows.&nbsp; As her eyelids sagged shut, she felt all the muddy memories and thoughts that had been so violently stirred up sinking like so much silt settling, leaving the body of water clear and calm again.<br />She sank down into heavy sleep underneath the weight of all those thoughts, all those feelings and forgot to dream at all.<br /><br />-***-<br /><br />It was damn exhausting to be alive right now.&nbsp; Severus felt numb most of the time as if he were moving in slow motion and the rest of the world was whizzing past.&nbsp; Severus stood with his hands braced on either side of the Pensieve, looking down on the memories that he&rsquo;d just poured out.<br /><br />Tonight was an Occlumency evening. <br /><br />Other than the Occlumency lessons, not much of note had happened in the week after the breakout.&nbsp; The Prophet reported it of course, obscuring enormous chunks of information regarding the break, publishing only the bare essentials.&nbsp; Whether this was at the request of the Ministry or not, Severus could not be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; The staff of Hogwarts had promptly been banned from sharing any information about the break or assuaging student fears by the issue of a new Ministry gag.&nbsp; Fair enough.<br /><br />However, some of his Slytherins were acting up and out, emboldened by the escape.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d done his best to station himself in their vicinity when students whose families had been victims of the Death Eaters passed, to discourage any unseemly taunting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that his presence affected that little Malfoy idiot, who made it clear he was ready to get his Dark Mark right now.&nbsp; And Severus hadn&rsquo;t even managed to get anything useful from Draco.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d had to squeeze the boy for information about Potter when he&rsquo;d stopped by earlier that evening.<br /><br />It was with great relish that Severus turned his lip up at the little twit and told Draco that he hoped this new responsibility as Umbridge&rsquo;s thug would not affect the Slytherin team&rsquo;s chance of winning the cup. That would keep Draco out of his hair for a good while, and so much the better, Severus didn&rsquo;t fancy seeing more students after hours.&nbsp; With the task of teaching Potter in the evenings, Severus&rsquo; free time was pared down considerably.<br /><br />The free time might not have been an issue, but Potter was not even trying.&nbsp; It was not a difficult request; self restraint, a modicum of control and an effort to simply allow his mind to go blank.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d seen Potter's eyes during Potions lessons, a blank mind would be no great feat. Yet he seemed to resist out of spite. <br /><br />There was a knock on the door.&nbsp; Speak of the devil and he shall appear&hellip;<br /><br />&ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; Severus said, low and calm as he could manage.&nbsp; Potter slunk in, looking guilty as always and sunk round-shouldered into the chair in front of Severus&rsquo; desk.<br /><br />This lesson was no different from any other.&nbsp; The first few tries were dismal.&nbsp; Clear your mind, Severus would instruct, let go of your feelings.&nbsp; But with almost no effort at all Severus evaded Potter&rsquo;s every defense and was able to wrench up any stream of memories.<br /><br />&ldquo;I might be able to <em>do it,</em>&rdquo; Potter hissed, from his usual spot curled up in a ball on the floor, &ldquo;if you told me <em>how!</em>&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Sit.&nbsp; Gather your thoughts,&rdquo; Severus said coldly.&nbsp; He pointed one finger, still shaking slightly, to Potter&rsquo;s chair before sinking slowly into his own.<br /><br />Explanations, he fumed, Potter wanted explanations.&nbsp; Was Severus also supposed to figure out how Potter's miniscule mind worked and then devise an infantile list of steps on how to shut it down?&nbsp; You either could, or you couldn&rsquo;t, that was the only explanation Severus could provide.&nbsp; Albus should have known that.<br /><br />And then there was the scar, which peeked through the rat's nest of hair as Potter breathed heavily across from him, shooting Severus a vicious look.<br /><br />Bitter bile rose in Severus&rsquo; throat every time he laid eyes on that scar&hellip; every time he thought about it.&nbsp; That scar, that leftover link between Potter and the Dark Lord was a sort of Dark Mark in itself. <br /><br />Potter hadn&rsquo;t even earned it. <br /><br />For a fraction of a second, Severus felt revulsion at himself because he had earned the brand on his arm.&nbsp; Worked for it, wanted it.&nbsp; Now, he all he wanted was for the damn thing to simply disappear so he could just forget.&nbsp; Severus was vaguely aware that his fingers were halfway through the process of twitching across his lap towards his left arm, and he was leaning forward like a cobra deciding whether it should strike.<br /><br /><em>Deep breath, relax, lean back.</em><br /><br />Lived&hellip; Potter hadn&rsquo;t even really lived - no, survived - on his own.&nbsp; A bawling infant that dripped and wailed mindlessly had not defeated the Dark Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Lily&rsquo;s sacrifice was responsible for Potters vaunted survival.&nbsp; Her sacrifice was hardly the baby&rsquo;s boon.&nbsp; Yet that child had replaced Severus, twice.&nbsp; Once as a baby and now as an inept teenager who could hardly stand on his own.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t as if Potter was special, remarkable, or even clever.&nbsp; He had no discernable talents of his own, outside of the Patronus and that odd ability to lead his friends astray and break the rules without being punished.<br /><br />Potter was, after all, the favorite.&nbsp; <br /><br />Exceptions would be made if it was Potter; Potter could be the youngest and fourth competitor in a TriWizard tournament.&nbsp; Potter could stalk around Hogsmeade without a permission form.&nbsp; Potter could set an escapee from Azkaban on the world. Potter could be made head boy even though he had never been a prefect and rarely behaved well. As far as Severus could tell, there was no difference between father and son, save for their eyes.&nbsp; They were both detestable thieves...&nbsp; Though Potter&rsquo;s son had stolen something that was worth far less than what his father had taken.<br /><br />None of that mattered, apparently, everyone wanted to believe Potter now because they all placed their faith in a teenage boy.&nbsp; That this insolent, unimaginative, and often stupid teenager would have the strength to defeat the Dark Lord&hellip;<br /><br /><em>It was supposed to be me</em>; that thought sprang to mind so violently that Severus nearly had to shut down his brain entirely.<br /><br />Severus remembered being the one Albus had faith in, the one who might have been the hero, when he might have gotten what he deserved.&nbsp; Seeing that faith transferred to so unworthy a recipient meant every moment spent alone with the usurping Potter was added insult to injury.&nbsp; <br /><br />Insult to injury?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s putting it lightly, Severus thought.&nbsp; He hated the child who had stolen his place, his fame, his honor. Potter would know how it was going to feel when this war ended and his name would be shouted and praised. He hated the child&rsquo;s father &ndash; who took Lily away from him. <br /><br />He hated the child who had taken Lily away from him.<br /><br />&ldquo;Up Potter. We&rsquo;ll try again.&rdquo;<br /><br />Standing at the ready Potter steeled himself to try to repel another attack.&nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;Legilimens!&rdquo;<br /><br />The pricking-hot feeling of Potter's anger washed over his brain first, followed by a blur of un-important memories.&nbsp; Hot and sour anger at a fat woman with a fat dog.&nbsp; A mournful ache as he watched a blond pig of a boy unwrap a mountain of presents.&nbsp; The tingling feeling of un-cried tears blurring a vision of dust motes dancing in the light filtered through cracks in a room too small to be a room.<br /><br />Cool darkness, the sound of feet on stone, a point of light at the end of a long stone hallway.&nbsp; An unbearable ache high in his stomach that moved into his throat as a hand that did not belong to him reached out to touch a door that was still too far away&hellip;<br /><br />The Department of Mysteries&hellip;<em>again.&nbsp; </em><br /><br />Severus broke the spell too quickly, to spite Potter. A considerate Legilimens would have slipped out quietly to avoid giving both parties the ringing headache that came along with too many thoughts stirred up too quickly.&nbsp; Severus usually gave no clue that he was stealthily perusing student thoughts, but here in the lessons it did not matter.<br /><br />Because Potter was still dreaming about the Department of Mysteries, and Severus suspected in the bitter pit of his stomach that Potter was trying to deliberately out-do him once again.&nbsp; Severus glared at him as he dragged himself up off the floor; the stupid boy was welcoming the dream.&nbsp; Welcoming the chance to look through the Dark Lord&rsquo;s eyes and pass the information on the way he had when Arthur Weasley had been attacked.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, Potter loved being the hero, didn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; Loved being&hellip;special.<br /><br /><em>No, Potter, you are not special,</em> Severus thought vehemently. He had to bite his tongue to keep the words from spilling out.&nbsp;<em> It is not your job to find out what the Dark Lord is planning. It&rsquo;s mine.<br /></em><br />Potter wanted that too, did he?&nbsp; Did Potter want to watch torture, and spend fourteen years watching every word, maintaining every connection in a network of people that would turn his stomach?&nbsp; Did Potter want to live in limbo, chained to a teacher&rsquo;s desk with a quill marking down essays while his contemporaries rose ever higher in their fields?&nbsp; Did Potter want to live every day as though he were starving &ndash; not for food, nothing that simple, but for something that could never be reclaimed?&nbsp; <br /><br />It didn&rsquo;t matter, Potter couldn&rsquo;t have the job.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><em>It&rsquo;s MINE.</em><br /><br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for one day,&rdquo; Severus said coolly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Severus dismissed the boy for the night with the usual warning to let his mind go blank and passive before he fell asleep; not that Potter would actually do the homework despite the fact that it was mind numbingly easy.&nbsp; Potter's inevitable failure to master Occlumency would be Severus&rsquo; boon.&nbsp; Stopping the lessons meant Severus would not be pinched painfully between the Dark Lord and Albus, and Potter&rsquo;s failure would prove that he was not as clever as everyone thought&hellip;<br /><br />But it was not, for once, entirely Potter&rsquo;s fault that he was here after hours failing miserably, Severus thought numbly as he drifted through the door leading from his office to his quarters.&nbsp; Some of the blame could be laid on Albus who would not deal with Potter <em>at all</em>.&nbsp; Albus&rsquo; resistance pushed a niggling splinter of resentment under Severus&rsquo; skin.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t he know how badly this assignment squashed Severus between the two sides, the danger it put both spies in?&nbsp; What the hell was he avoiding?&nbsp; <br /><br />For a second Severus thought he heard that cord snap, the tether of Albus&rsquo; trust, and he had had no idea why Albus would take the trust away.&nbsp; Had Black&rsquo;s words,<em> I don&rsquo;t care if Dumbledore thinks you&rsquo;ve reformed, I know better</em>, sunk in?&nbsp; Severus had to control a brief, sweaty moment of panic at that thought. <br /><br />Was Severus spending all those hours down there training his replacement?&nbsp; Who needed a spy in the flesh if you had one who could circumvent all the tedious networking and delve straight into the Dark Lord&rsquo;s mind?<br /><br />What would he have if he could no longer spy?<br /><em><br />Nothing</em>.&nbsp; He would have absolutely nothing.&nbsp; That struck him with the cold force of a wave, nearly pulling him under into complete panic.<br /><br />No, that was unreasonable!&nbsp; If there was something, if Severus was suspected, wouldn&rsquo;t Albus have the dignity to tell him?&nbsp; Albus was nothing if not forthright&hellip; usually.&nbsp; Severus vowed to concentrate on assuring Albus that he was the best man for this job, and he spread his net wide to see what letters and tidbits of information he could catch from the other Death Eaters with the new status and respect won through Lourdes.<br /><br />Happily, when Potter was not in his sight, it was easy enough to forget about him because there were so many other things to worry about.&nbsp; Tonight was a swimming night.&nbsp; He dutifully went through the motions of dressing to swim and escorting Lourdes down through the corridors to the pool.<br /><br />Then there was the problem of Lourdes herself, Severus thought, giving her a sideways glare as her body broke the surface and she became little more than a blur under the water.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d become a walking bomb since she&rsquo;d come back bruised from the Azkaban outing.&nbsp; Only he didn&rsquo;t know when she was set to explode, or how hard he would need to jostle her to set her off.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure why she was so angry, but he had a pretty good idea based on his own experiences dealing with Albus.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />There wasn&rsquo;t much opportunity to ask her either.&nbsp; Lourdes did two things now that she had no projects: she slept and she swam.&nbsp; Despite Severus&rsquo; stern warning that she should keep exercise light until they knew for sure that she hadn&rsquo;t sustained any deep organ injuries<br /><br />It was not as easy to concentrate on keeping his strokes even and precise when his mind was more occupied with the business of her.&nbsp; Severus stopped once in awhile to watch her, doing his best to avoid being caught staring, because it wasn&rsquo;t just her attitude he was assessing.<br /><br />The attraction would not be rationalized.&nbsp; There was something about being the subject of Lourdes&rsquo; full focused attention that was a little bit like being an ant under a magnifying glass on a sunny day.&nbsp; That peculiar intensity made her hell in an interrogation room, but the other side to that coin was that when Lourdes focused that raw gaze on you in any positive sense, you began thinking like she did.&nbsp; That if you just fought harder or thought harder you could do anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />But that was not a complete explanation.&nbsp; He would have been perfectly satisfied to keep her at arms length and secretly, grudgingly, admire that un-nameable quality from a distance.&nbsp; This time the thought of maintaining quiet distance upset him, and called up something raw and demanding in his gut, a feeling that was both familiar and alien<br /><br />Severus put that thought on hold, gaze drifting over to Lourdes when she hauled herself out of the water and stood under the spray of the poolside shower to wash the chemicals off.&nbsp; As long as she kept her eyes closed, he was free to look wherever he liked.&nbsp; Somewhere along the line she&rsquo;d traded adolescent awkwardness for a sleek, rangy ease that made him think of a tiger leisurely pacing its corner of the jungle.&nbsp; He made another slow, visual run up the length of her legs, across the plane of her stomach, up and over the modest rise-and-curve of her breasts all the way to the calm smile on her lips.<br /><br />The sight triggered a greedy hunger that made him feel as if someone had torn out a vital organ his body was frantic to get back.&nbsp;&nbsp; This disturbing sensation was not quite lust and not quite longing.&nbsp; Whatever it was, it hurt in a very unfamiliar way.&nbsp; As soon as he saw her reach for the water tap, he looked away and began the process of toweling off. <br /><br />Lourdes was not&hellip;her.&nbsp; She could never be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lourdes would not ever be the first beautiful thing he had ever seen.&nbsp; She was too sharp, too dark, too hard.&nbsp; Lourdes would not ever be the first face which had always been full of light.&nbsp; Lily&rsquo;s joy and curiosity had been the only thing that ever sated the primal hunger all children had, all adults for wonder, beauty, and joy.&nbsp; They were things Severus had rarely experienced, and could not produce for himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; He needed those things like he needed air, and without Lily in his life in those last years of school, he had run a deficit of them Lourdes could not really fill.&nbsp; Lourdes would never be the enchanting, radiant, joyful girl who lit up the room, charmed everyone, who saw good where there was scarcely any.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Lourdes was too much like him.<br /><br />And yet&hellip;this new hunger and hurt persisted.<br /><br />They did not speak when it was time to go back to his quarters.&nbsp; She merely gave him an expectant look before he transformed her into a moth for transportation, and then proceeded to ignore him and guzzle sleeping potions as soon as he was in the bathroom.&nbsp; He doled out sedatives to her get her out of his hair, out of his sight, but it wasn&rsquo;t taking her off his mind.<br /><br />Severus passed the feather bed on his way out of the bath, and frowned at the little shape sleeping there. It had been a week since the Death Eaters' escape, and something about the experience still seemed to be following her around like a ghost. It had set her on edge, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before she couldn&rsquo;t run from it anymore. <br /><br />It was down to sink or swim now.<br /><br />And they couldn&rsquo;t afford her sinking, not with all the Death Eaters fresh out of prison and eager to please. They were in the thick of it, able to access the Master and tap any line of information any time they could manage it. Not like him and Lourdes; they had to rely on the damn letters.<br /><br />With her body twisted up in the sheets she looked like an unfortunate insect trapped in a spider web. Lourdes squirmed in her bundle of covers and his stomach squirmed with her. <br /><br />It wasn&rsquo;t as if he&rsquo;d asked for all this, or even looked for it. It had just sort of... happened.<br /><br />Feeling numb and oddly disconnected, Severus drifted back to bed and tried to just lay still and drift off. But that feeling and the vicious pounding headache from the Occlumency lessons made it damn hard to fall asleep as he lay in bed willing his insides to stop their rebellion. He let the culpable thoughts about her slip through his consciousness into dormant darkness so he could find a way to sleep without them rattling around his brain and guts, perhaps eventually he would make sense of them.<br /><em><br />That small, stunned smile that made him feel as though he were falling with no place to land&hellip;<br /><br />Her skinny little hand lighting on top of his and leaving behind a warm electric trail&hellip;<br /><br />Watching the path the water took when it ran down the angles and curves of her body&hellip;</em><br /><br />With those thoughts and images slipping away, other memories reeled themselves out as he fell into the quiet place between full sleep and waking.<br /><br />Of being small, being helpless, being scared&hellip;.<br /><br /></span>&nbsp;</span></span><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

 </span><i style=""""><span style=""font-family: Garamond;"">War makes thieves and peace hangs them.&nbsp; ~George Herbert</span></i></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Lourdes spent most of the hours leading up to her soul removal sorting through her old Capture Unit gear. Metin, her partner during her full time service in the unit, had conveniently &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; to confiscate her gear when they raided her home during the arrest. Not that it would have done the department any good to take it; it certainly wasn&rsquo;t going to fit anyone else.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">To their credit, O.H.K. had done a brilliant job designing strike uniforms; the body suits covered everything except the head and fingers past the second joint, but they were outlandishly expensive because they were made of rubbery Graphorn hide, seams hand stitched with reinforced unicorn hair. Graphorn replaced the cheaper dragon hide favored by most M.L.E. teams because if properly tanned, Graphorn still retained the ability to deflect spells- not that the initial impact of the magic was diminished. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Lourdes&rsquo; had been tooled with specific incantations, runes, and her own amulets by a leather charmer for extra protection.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">
 It was a pity, though, that they&rsquo;d never figured out how to dye it without degrading its ability to protect, the murky gray-purple had earned the capture unit several unflattering nicknames. Name calling and fashion faux pas aside, the gear had saved her life more times than she could properly count. Severus caught her while she was straining to examine the effect of the suit on her backside in the mirror, and his only response had been a sort of grim smile and cocked eyebrow. 
 
 &ldquo;Oh, fine for you to laugh, but try being the only woman on a capture team wearing that! I looked like I got off a shift at an S&amp;M club,&rdquo; Lourdes objected, with a frustrated gesture at the complicated seams, zips and molded armored plates necessary to make thick leather fit a female figure. Well, she thought, at least it still fit nicely, which meant she was back in working shape and wouldn&rsquo;t have to spend time letting the seams out. 
 
 Truthfully she was nervous, she hadn&rsquo;t participated in a raid in four years, but the ritual of preparing her gear and taking care of her weapons helped ease her anxiety a little bit. This was the second time in the past few months that she&rsquo;d realized exactly how deep in she was, and how one hundred and fifty percent illegal it was to be &lsquo;spying&rsquo; for a militia within a terrorist cell without the government&rsquo;s express approval. <span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She was no longer toeing the line &ndash; the line was long gone.
 
 That evening, as she looked over what had once been her uniform, Lourdes stewed over the memories that had resurfaced over the past few days. Thoughts of collars, good and bad, with the capture team and everything about life with O.H.K. drifted lazily through her brain. Once, she&rsquo;d been the one they wanted on the case, not because of the magic but because she was a damn good profiler, and hell to face in an interrogation room. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Her post in Behavioral Analysis had been the best time in her adult life. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Hashim left her alone and in effectively in charge for the last five years while he tried to engineer his political career. Work there pleased her; she enjoyed every facet of it &ndash; picking the cases, grading her team, going on the hunt, and being completely unfettered by the sticky bureaucratic end of the work.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>And there was no denying that she loved the attention it brought her and the department when her team succeeded. 
 
 Considering those motivations, she wasn&rsquo;t so sure now that she ought to be all that proud of any success she had there. Not when Lourdes knew others in the Order were playing for higher stakes; family, friends, and that slippery concept of &lsquo;the safety of the world,&rsquo; instead of awards and headlines in the professional journals. She&rsquo;d never made time for high stakes, not after having lost two families and an only-friend.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">More unwelcome memories surfaced when she thought of family. As the last child of an undertaker, she&rsquo;d insisted on being allowed to take care of the bodies, and still vividly remembered the clink of bullet slugs dropping into the kidney dish as she fished them out one by one, dutifully sewing up each hole. Even wizards could not resist cold lead. All of the funerals had been taken care of as instructed; some were cremated, some embalmed, some just buried, but her father had always been a special case.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It had been no mean feat for a thirteen year old girl to wheedle and fight the Iranian Zoroaster into letting her use one of the Towers of Silence for her father. But she&rsquo;d managed, and for the first time Lourdes started to believe that she could do anything as long if she worked or fought hard enough.
 
 There was no fight for her father&rsquo;s memory here; hell, she didn&rsquo;t even have a position here really worth protecting. That new resentment had been sparked by the arrival of several letters addressed to Severus. Only to Severus - which made Lourdes painfully aware that she didn&rsquo;t hold the same level of sway he did, not even close. 
 
 Now even the Carrows cut him a wide berth when he walked through a crowd of Death Eaters. He&rsquo;d finally reached a steady little plateau in his ascent up the confidences of the Dark Lord. But Lourdes didn&rsquo;t even have a name as far as they were concerned; the Dark Lord, and everyone else, referred to her as &lsquo;lich&rsquo; and &lsquo;corpse&rsquo; (or irritatingly, in Malfoy&rsquo;s case, as &ldquo;Severus&rsquo; pet&rdquo;). So far, Severus had been good enough never to bring it up outside of the presumptuous contact letters from other Death Eaters, who were eager to latch onto the coat tails of someone rising through the ranks as quickly as he was. 
 
 She remained a mere object, simply an inhuman extension of Severus&rsquo; power. Lourdes hated the whole ugly concept, in spite of herself and her constant reminders that there was no shame in failing to be recognized in this arena. But it was the principle of the matter, the mere thought that she was being used by Severus the way she&rsquo;d been exploited by Hashim&hellip; Lourdes froze at that thought, slumping down over the table with her head on her arms, taking a deep breath to try to banish the feeling that she was coming apart at the seams. She could hardly imagine how long Severus had lived under the strain, but all his seams were apparently unbreakable.
 
 Speaking of Severus, he seemed beyond nervous about her assignment (it really would be a shame, she thought bitterly, for him to loose such a useful tool to an incompetent guardian) and had worked himself into a bit of a frenzy. He rushed between his office and the kitchen, muttering and hissing when he ought to be answering those letters or reading up on the Occlumency books.
 
 &ldquo;Have you got a potions holster in this mess?&rdquo; he snapped, swooping down over the table to scowl into the pile of leather.
 
 Lourdes held up a dragon-hide belt covered with little compartments and pockets and an assortment of knife holsters. &ldquo;Standard issue,&rdquo; she said, to avoid hissing<i style=""""> I am the trained professional, you know.</i></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bringing a knife then? Do you think that will do you any good?&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;The six and a half meter rule applies Mr. Snape, within six and a half meters the trained short blade user has the advantage, I can be at your side causing pain, debilitation or death in one point twenty five seconds - long before you can aim and hit.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Outside that distance I have other options.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">
 &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Severus slammed down the little tray he was carrying and seated himself across from her.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; she asked, raising an eyebrow and gesturing to the tiny bottles and ampoules glittering in the tray.
 
 &ldquo;Measures to assure that I won&rsquo;t be planning your funeral,&rdquo; he replied in a very matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;You will be able to handle the Dementors with few problems, you say?&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be too distracted once I split the first one open- like throwing breadcrumbs at a flock of pigeons. With my soul out I&rsquo;ll be able to manage contact with them long enough to do my work. It won&rsquo;t be like it was at the castle.&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;In any case, chocolate,&rdquo; he huffed, sliding a wrapped up chunk over to her.
 
 &ldquo;Chocolate.&rdquo; Lourdes struggled to keep a very serious expression; in truth it felt ridiculous to put sweets in her tactical belt.
 
 &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s breath.&rdquo; He slid three little glass ampoules shaped like chili peppers towards her. &ldquo;Break the ampoule with your teeth and you get about thirty seconds of fire breathing. The potion is designed to be resistant to saliva so your mouth will be fine, but be careful of your eyebrows and hair. Three ampoules of Garroting Gas, and two Strengthening Solutions, and for your escape plan should they decide to abandon you&hellip;&rdquo;
 
 Severus neatly laid out six wrapped wads about the size of very large gobstoppers, with an expression that suggested he was giving up a dearly held treasure. &ldquo;Six hours of Gillyweed. That should give you more than enough time to swim to shore. You are bringing the compass, correct?&rdquo;
 
 Lourdes held up the little gold, glass topped tin with a tiny map of Britain painted on the bottom where the compass directions should have been. The needle was charmed to point towards Hogwarts at all times. Considering that it was the personal property of the Headmaster, it was extraordinarily generous of him to lend it to her, considering the circumstances. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got enough Muggle money to call the safe house if I can make it to a telephone. You don&rsquo;t have anything for hypothermia in there, do you?&rdquo;
 
 He sighed, and slid several potions in screw top phials over towards her. &ldquo;The potion in the red phial is for hypothermia, the potions in the blue bottles are powerful analgesics without sedative effects.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">After arranging the assortment of phials and packages in the belt&rsquo;s various compartments, Lourdes strapped the belt on to make sure she&rsquo;d remember where she put what, along with her respective daggers. 
 
 Then it was with some cold dread that she approached her trunk to get the chalk and the guides for the soul removal&hellip;
 
 
 -***-
 
 Severus hadn&rsquo;t ever seen a soul removal before, and he was rather curious about the process, but unfortunately his lessons would keep him from witnessing it. Albus had loaned out Helga Hufflepuff&rsquo;s solar for the affair as it was quiet, out of the way, and had a sufficiently smooth floor for Lourdes to draw on. 
 
 As far as he knew, Lourdes had spent the better part of fifteen hours in a state of ecstatic meditation in the middle of the most elaborate spell system he&rsquo;d ever seen. When Severus rushed to the solar in the middle of supper he found her sitting still as a cemetery statue (and about as cheerful looking) on a battered chair. The floor had been wiped down and a little silver Ghau set with a chunk of red coral sat on the table, sparkling innocently in the late afternoon light.
 
 She&rsquo;d already suited herself up in tactical gear (Severus did his best not to stare ungainly when confronted with Lourdes in second skin leather), fringe pinned back and the rest of her hair secured under a knitted cap with her cloak and mask ready. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>He&rsquo;d never actually seen a Dementor&rsquo;s Kiss, but soul removals were supposed to be beyond horrible to watch and beyond horrible to experience, and it showed. Lourdes seemed&hellip; grayer somehow; her skin, her hair, just about every thing looked lifeless. Only her eyes retained any real color.
 
 &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Lourdes muttered, standing up and snatching the Ghau on its chain off the table. As she passed, Lourdes looped the chain around his neck, and when her fingers brushed his face he couldn&rsquo;t help shuddering. She was as cold as a stone.
 
 The forest was disturbingly quiet for this time of day, as was Lourdes. While they waited near a group of trees, Severus pretended to be absorbed in collecting tree bark to avoid talking to her in this state. Mercifully, within minutes of their arrival, a flash of drab brown scuttled over his boots and a short, watery eyed little man appeared with a look that was part simpering, part shrewd.
 
 &ldquo;Lich,&rdquo; Pettigrew squeaked, though his eyes were assessing her thoroughly as she pulled her robes and mask on over the tactical gear.
 
 &ldquo;Pettigrew,&rdquo; she replied flatly, tugging her hood into place.
 
 This whole affair and the first Occlumency lesson, which he was probably going to be late for, made Severus&rsquo; stomach churn. Pettigrew could not be trusted with his old friends, let alone someone who had the potential to be a very heavy burden. He had to send Lourdes out unprotected, and the thought crashed against him like a cold wave, a nervous shock that spread from his heart down to his fingertips. Severus had to ball his hands up in his pockets and breathe deeply to keep himself from shaking.
 
 A hundred imagined experiences rushed his brain for just a moment, not just of what would happen to her, but what would happen to him if she was absent. That seat across the tea table had been empty for years, but now he could not imagine seeing it empty again. He did not want to pass the feather mattress in the corner at night and not see the familiar outline of her body, asleep. There was the thought that she would just vanish as she had before, taking all the years and hours with her.
 
 He hadn&rsquo;t prepared himself for this sudden panic. What had his last words to her been before? <i style="""">As if you </i>could<i style=""""> conjure that thing up&hellip;</i>
 
 Just as Pettigrew was about to take her arm for a Side Along, Severus leaned in to whisper in her half-ear. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo; There was no questioning tone, no shadow of doubt. It was more of a command than anything else. What else could he tell her?<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Her only response was a knowing smile and a sly sideways look.
 
 Severus turned and dropped a hand on Pettigrew&rsquo;s shoulder, flashing a thin, venomous smile as he hissed, &ldquo;If you do not return the body in one reasonably functioning piece, I will make sure the Dark Lord lets me soften you up for him, Peter. Why, I think the little punishment he might give me for ah&hellip;accidentally killing you would be entirely worth it.&rdquo; 
 
 He took a step back as Pettigrew snatched Lourdes&rsquo; wrist hastily and the two of them vanished. His skin, his whole body, felt oddly heavy and sluggish as he turned on his heel and started back to the castle.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">It must have been the cold. 
 
 -***-
 
 Of course she would live, Lourdes thought patiently; after all, here she sat positively surrounded by vital force. 
 
 For an Evocator, a clean soul removal turned things around in the head, dredging up centuries old instincts.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Disconnected completely from concientia she had only her rational thought to guide her actions.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>But she could see the life burning off her body and the four others in the little boat with her as the seconds ticked steadily by. The presence of all that warm, abundant life summoned a primal hunger in the back of her brain that she had to work very hard to control. 
 
 Thinking it better not to stare at the veritable buffet surrounding her, Lourdes chose to watch the sun die for the night, while the grey, watery curve of the earth began to blur into the dark sky.
 
 With a tap of Malfoy&rsquo;s wand, the little boat and its passengers became invisible. They bobbed with the waves while the Auror&rsquo;s Guard Boat, out checking for bodies in the ocean no doubt, rounded the corner of Azkaban towards the guard Auror&rsquo;s island and vanished. The Death Eaters were quick on their feet; Lourdes was pushed onto a broom behind Pettigrew while McNair and Gibbon mounted brooms of their own, each with a bundle of spare brooms tied underneath. When the second the party was airborne, Malfoy flicked his wand again, causing the boat to groan and vanish into the sea.
 
 While Lourdes sat precariously balanced on that little strip of wood, she had to bite down hard on her lip to restrain her eager, squirmy hunger (was this how vampires felt when they were around warm, blood-filled bodies?) for the life trapped in Pettigrew. After just a few minutes, he elbowed her hard, signaling her to slide off the broom and land as gracefully as could be expected on the ground.
 
 He retreated into the black mass of water and sky, leaving her stranded on the darkest, dreariest slab of lifeless rock she&rsquo;d ever seen. When Lourdes took a deep breath, she smelled the centuries of death and decay&hellip; The Dementors had found her.
 
 In this state, they looked stranger than usual. In addition to the swirling masses of black, she saw a warm glow of light through their robes and carcasses, right in their centers, making them look like so many little milky galaxies floating in mid air. They had no lives she could see, nothing burned off them. They seemed suspended in their state of decay, happy to thumb the spot where their noses might have been at the whole concept of time. 
 
 Instinctive cold sweat broke out on her skin as she stood, ready to pounce while the Dementors circled; they didn&rsquo;t seem to know what to do with her. At least thirty voices whispered hoarsely, disorienting her, making her feel like she was going to spiral away, until she remembered to put a hand on the hilt of her father&rsquo;s dagger; it gave her a good feeling of control, something solid under her feet like a ocean floor in a heavy tide.
 
 The whispering sounded like logical conversation now; they were urging each other to discover the nature of the intruder. One Dementor reached out cautiously to touch her and recoiled as if burned. Lourdes forced herself to remain still, trying not to inhale too deeply as the Dementors from the far side of the island swept over to join their colleagues in assessing this new addition to the environment. She had to have them all in one place&hellip;
 
 It offers no food, the mind seems empty, one hissed. No soul in the body, but it had one once, whispered another, it wasn&rsquo;t our work. There is no magic we can take, the one who&rsquo;d reached out to touch her hissed, its magic is old, in the blood and the bones&hellip; As they continued to hiss and sputter, trying to decide when they had last seen someone like her, Lourdes used the brief calm as an opportunity to select the fattest, fullest one. 
 
 Two Dementors into the crowd, there was an extraordinarily old, rotten one bursting with other people&rsquo;s souls. Pushing her way into the mass of black, she reached up and grabbed it right where its neck ought to be, driving hard iron into the creature&rsquo;s sternum, hearing a heady, satisfying crack as a reward for every blow. 
 
 The silver mass inside its stomach burst out, twisting and warping in the air in an attempt to separate into the distinct beings it used to be. Lourdes was quickly forgotten, jostled from side to side as every Dementor on the island descended like vultures at a sky burial, all trying to suck up as much as they could of the mass of light. The Dementors&rsquo; magic had an almost gravitational pull on the souls, which remained trapped in orbit while the Dementors battled each other for the privilege of devouring the most.
 
 She felt that control slip from under her feet again, disgust and hatred rising to fill every cell of her body. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Who could compare her to these&hellip;things? Lashing out quickly, she grabbed another stuffed greedy creature, hammering away at its chest before leaving it to hiss and deflate. The writhing creatures didn&rsquo;t even notice the bodies crumpling in their midst&hellip; By the time she heard the shouts of the other Death Eaters as they touched down, she was in the middle of cracking open a fourth.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">
 Crossing the gap between her edge of the island and the prison&rsquo;s massive oak and iron doors at a heavy run, she came to a halt next to Gibbon and the massive form of Azkaban itself. The building rose straight up from the rock as if it was hewn from the dead island itself - a dismal tower with the tiniest dark gun-slits for windows. It smelled indescribably filthy, though Lourdes soon realized that some of the stench was her. 
 
 &ldquo;Lich, Pettigrew, flank these doors and keep watch. Pettigrew, send red sparks if the Aurors approach,&rdquo; Malfoy hissed as he, Gibbon, Avery, and McNair rushed the entrance. There was a heavy crackling sound as the doors flew off their hinges and a strange rainbow of light washed over them- the residue of seven or eight wards shattering in mid air.
 
 She turned to check on the Dementors, and from here it looked like they were having the time of their lives swarming the remnants of their fellows. The air was thick with the crackling of souls released from the Dementors&rsquo; bellies and the creatures&rsquo; own ravenous hissing as they fought; they&rsquo;d be occupied with this for a while yet.
 
 &ldquo;Gods, how much longer are they going to be&hellip;&rdquo; Pettigrew bounced nervously onto the balls of his feet to see as far as he could. He did look deliciously warm and alive; Lourdes felt her tongue slip out to wet her lips- nobody would have to know if she stole a little life on the sly. 
 
 That was when she saw them approaching in their little boat. Eight&hellip;no- nine warm bodies.
 
 &ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; she said in an oddly hollow voice.
 
 Pettigrew reacted much faster than she would have expected, sending a brilliant red comet streaking into the prison, but Malfoy and the others seemed to be dawdling. Lourdes&rsquo; first instinct was to run for cover within the clump of Dementors, but she stood her ground. Wiping her fingers on her robe, she reached into the potions belt and fished out a Dragon&rsquo;s Breath before swapping her phurba for the misericorde.
 
 <i style="""">Ready when you are.</i>
 
 Malfoy emerged at the head of a clump of wild looking people who were touching their faces and filling their lungs with night air as if they could not believe this was really happening. A few were looking around for the Aurors, pausing to gawk at the mass of Dementors too preoccupied with devouring the remnants of their colleagues to do their job.
 
 &ldquo;Gibbon, Avery, McNair- take the rear. Pettigrew, lich- flank them.&rdquo; 
 
 The escapees, led by Malfoy, made a beeline for the brooms just as the Aurors crested the hill. The Aurors were flinging hexes left and right, obviously trying to stay on target, but their aim was sloppy and they were slightly out of breath from the run and the panic (apparently they could not believe this was happening either). The other Death Eaters fanned out, forming a shield to keep the escapees safe as they rocketed off the island. One of the former prisoners, a woman with a gaunt face and a matted mess of hair, was begging loudly for a wand with a bloodthirsty look in her eyes before Malfoy shoved a broom in her hands.
 
 They were supposed to hold the Aurors back as long as they could, to give the escapees enough time to fly out of range, but only Malfoy seemed to have any skill at dueling. Everyone else was firing off the Death Curse and Cruciatus as fast as they could get the words out, blowing huge holes in the ground and kicking up clouds of dust. 
 
 She&rsquo;d nearly reached the island&rsquo;s edge where the brooms were supposed to be lined up, but she caught sight of the slight hunched form of Avery mounting a broom and speeding out.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>In the midst of the thick, dusty air and panic, Lourdes was failing miserably in her search for Pettigrew, and then she felt another body collide with hers. She was suddenly nose to nose with a blond man considerably younger than her- an Auror&hellip;
 
 The Auror was just as surprised as she was, and fumbled trying to get a curse out. In her haste, Lourdes resorted to a dirty old trick: she clamped an ice cold hand around the poor thing&rsquo;s neck, and loosened control over her magic just enough to stop him dead in his tracks. 
 
 Raw contact with an Evocator would send a jolt of cold, paralyzing fear through her victim. Any less control and she might have killed him. While he gasped and flapped his mouth like a horrified fish, Lourdes&rsquo; knife hand floated in front of his body, looking for a spot that would let her disable but not kill. 
 
 In went the dagger, down and just off to the side of anything important. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a little shock, don&rsquo;t fight it&hellip;&rdquo; Lourdes whispered. The metallic smell of blood overwhelmed the Dementor stench for a moment, and she felt that squirmy hunger for life crawl up inside when the warm sticky-wet feeling of it seeped over her fingers.
 
 Before she could even think about stealing life, she felt a strange tingle run over the back of her neck before several curses hit her squarely in the back. While the body armor neutralized the spells&rsquo; effects, their physical impact nearly cracked her spine and sent her crashing down on top of the Auror. Slipping the dagger out, she forced herself to slither through the dust, trying to find that musky rat smell that meant Pettigrew was nearby.
 
 A few more spells missed her, then one hit her leg; the body armor stopped the worst, but the spell had hit the vulnerable part near her ankle, and it might have broken a bone. Taking cover in the dust stirred up by the spells that missed, and attempting to ignore the pain of her back swelling up into one gigantic bruise, Lourdes rolled over to grope in her potions holster for a fresh weapon. Mild panic gripped her when the only thing she came up with from the first try was a few fingertips full of splintered glass and the potent smell of painkiller. There went her escape plan. 
 
 Mercifully, she&rsquo;d stuck the offensive potions in a hip pocket, and finding a Garroting Gas and a Smoke Solution still intact, Lourdes hurled them as far as she could manage. Two very satisfying explosions followed and she lost sight of the Aurors that had been firing at her.
 
 Starting forward again, she caught Pettigrew&rsquo;s scent on the air; he was right on top of her. A strong silver hand grabbed her wrist, caked in dust and blood, and he hauled her up and over to the last broom.
 
 A couple of Aurors who&rsquo;d just broken through the gas and smoke were taking aim, but Lourdes rolled out the Dragon&rsquo;s Breath ampoule hidden in her cheek, biting down and blowing a large cloud of fire in their direction. They shouted frantically as they extinguished one another while Pettigrew mounted the broom behind her, tipping her onto the handle sidesaddle. One hand stayed on the broom and the other snaked around her waist, forcing her to match the curve of his belly with her body whenever he hunched over to steer.
 
 Claustrophobic panic, gut level revulsion at the breath on her neck, and the pain from the pressure on her bruised back took over for a moment, and she threw off her hood and mask to get a face full of cold air. As the shock wore off, she realized one hand was still wrapped around the dagger, and the other had been sliced up by the glass shards from the potion ampoules. She meant to shove the misericorde back into the holster, but the path was blocked by Pettigrew&rsquo;s silver hand, the fingers of which were creeping down her side. 
 
 Lourdes narrowed her eyes dangerously as she watched the hand&rsquo;s progress. There seemed to be something off about the way Pettigrew was touching - no, holding her. His hand had slipped up under the filthy black robes and was sliding along the cool skin of her armor. It wasn&rsquo;t clear yet if this was a measure to keep her properly anchored on the broom, or something less innocuous.
 
 &ldquo;This is not a date, Pettigrew,&rdquo; Lourdes snapped, swatting his wrist with the blade while trying awkwardly to swing her good leg over the broom handle for a better seat. The broom shifted dangerously to one side, threatening to dump Lourdes backward into the water before Pettigrew&rsquo;s hand pressed flat and too-low on her stomach, bracing her against his body. 
 
 &ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Are you trying to get us both killed?&rdquo; He righted the broom admirably and they zipped along in silence for a moment. 
 
 &rdquo;Any casualties?&rdquo; Lourdes asked grimly.
 
 &ldquo;We were the last ones out. Malfoy left the second you were hit.&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;Remind me to take seven years out of him the next time I see him,&rdquo; she hissed. Just as the words slipped out, Lourdes realized she ought to watch her mouth; this wasn&rsquo;t Severus.
 
 &ldquo;McNair and Avery were right behind him. Gibbon stayed because he&rsquo;s too stupid to think on his own; I had to tell him to get on his damn broom.&rdquo; There was a little surge in Pettigrew just then, an unexpected glimmer of something competent.
 
 &ldquo;So the rat is a commander at heart. Is it true you took out thirteen Muggles with one curse?&rdquo; Lourdes muttered, swirling her tongue around inside her mouth looking for any little pebbles of melted glass left over from the Dragon&rsquo;s Breath.
 
 &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Pettigrew replied suspiciously. &ldquo;Why the hell did you just stab that Auror?&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t use a wand, you idiot.&rdquo; Probably not the best thing to say to someone who could dump you into the North Sea with one roll of the broom. &ldquo;In case you failed to notice, I did manage to keep the Dementors happy.&rdquo; 
 
 Pettigrew snorted derisively, and Lourdes ground her teeth against the inside of her cheek when she felt his thumb trace the ridge of her hipbone, almost playfully.
 
 &ldquo;And they say I&rsquo;m a coward,&rdquo; he said in a slightly mocking tone. He was so close that his lips brushed her cheek when he spoke.
 
 Lourdes turned her head to give him a look that could have frozen a volcano. &ldquo;What was that, Pettigrew?&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;A dagger? Not a sword, or even a mace.&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;It requires skill.&rdquo; 
 
 &ldquo;Highly concealable, anonymous, cowardly and treacherous, and exactly what I&rsquo;d expect from a Slytherin.&rdquo; His tone turned her house name into an epithet. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t a dagger the weapon of Brutus and the Senate when they killed Caesar?&rdquo;
 
 That was a stroke of sophistication Lourdes would not have expected from him, a dangerous underestimation on her part&hellip; She tried to think where he might have picked up the idea that she could be pushed around (oh, he was definitely trying), and it dawned on her rather quickly. Pettigrew had only seen her in meetings, where she was soft spoken and pliant. Her guardian protector, Snape, wasn&rsquo;t here right now, so there was plenty of time to feel her out. In a very literal fashion: Pettigrew&rsquo;s hand was starting to travel again. 
 
 By responding, she&rsquo;d played right into his hands. He&rsquo;d had brains enough to see if the behavior she presented at the meetings was the real deal, or if there was something else he needed to know.
 
 <i style="""">Dorje Bragsen preserve me</i>, she hissed internally. The hand had stationed itself on her thigh, a definite attempt at coercion. Fine then; if Pettigrew wanted to see her true nature, Lourdes would be more than happy to show him&hellip;
 
 &ldquo;It took twenty three strokes to kill Caesar; I&rsquo;ll do you in two if you don&rsquo;t get that hand off my leg,&rdquo; she growled, turning to bare her teeth at him.
 
 Mercifully, the rest of the broom ride was short; they arrived above a little island where a dark knot of people were gathered on the sand, clutching their brooms. Pettigrew touched down, his hand quickly moving up in what seemed like an attempt to get a handful when he went to &lsquo;help&rsquo; her up. Swatting him off as if he were a bothersome fly, Lourdes forced herself to stand on her good leg while Malfoy checked to make sure all necessary parties were present and accounted for. 
 
 He double, then triple checked the name Rookwood before his eyes landed on Lourdes. For a fraction of a second, Malfoy looked disappointed, before he gave his list a cursory glance and said coolly, &ldquo;And the lich, of course.&rdquo;
 
 She fought not to wince every time she put weight on her bad leg and mulled over the amount of additional damage she might be doing. It was a chance she was willing to take; there was no way in hell she was going to sit down when everyone else was standing. The crowd thinned slowly as Malfoy, McNair, and Avery Side Along-ed other Death Eaters to the various safe houses. Lourdes felt a sharp surge of hostility that she had been kept waiting here when Pettigrew could just as easily have taken her away as soon as their names were called.
 
 There was one last pop, and then it was just Lourdes and Pettigrew.
 
 Suddenly, he grinned maliciously; it twisted his face up and his posture changed to something rather aggressive. &ldquo;Is he fucking you?&rdquo;
 
 The instant those words registered in her brain, her first instinct was to kick him in the head hard enough to knock his skull off his spine. But the second she shifted her weight, she received a painful reminder that her whole body was in rotten shape. Instead, she fell forward onto Pettigrew, slamming her skull firmly into his to destabilize him. He fought a little as she struggled to pin him down, pricking him with the misericorde to distract him so she could sit up and get one boot wedged firmly under his jaw, with the dagger poised right above the tear duct on his left eye.
 
 &ldquo;Honestly, Pettigrew. I find your lack of professional courtesy astounding,&rdquo; she said, somewhat dizzily. It had been a long time since she&rsquo;d delivered a head-butt to anyone, and it made her ears ring faintly. &ldquo;I mean, if you did manage to get that hand on something interesting, don&rsquo;t you think I would at the very least tell Snape? Luckily for you, I prefer to settle my own scores. Do you know that if I just let this slip,&rdquo; Lourdes let the knife drop just a tiny bit, &ldquo;right down past your eye and into your prefrontal lobe, I could keep those hands from wanting to roam - permanently. Now, I have no qualms at all about performing a bit of neurosurgery if you should find yourself incapable of answering my questions. The first of which is: why would you ask me a question like that?&rdquo; 
 
 &ldquo;Merely confirming a suspicion the others hold,&rdquo; Pettigrew choked, trying to reduce his voice to a simpering squeak to distract her from the fact that he was trying to aim his wand at her.
 
 &ldquo;Drop it. I&rsquo;ll have this through your eye before you get the words out. Precisely who are these others?&rdquo; she asked coolly. It was a bizarre accusation, terribly clumsy, but it might be worth filing away whatever he had to say for future reference.
 
 &ldquo;Well, Lucius&hellip;&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie. Lucius Malfoy knows you only by reputation. He thinks you are garbage, and I am willing to put money on the assertion that he doesn&rsquo;t particularly care about anyone&rsquo;s nocturnal activities but his own. Try again.&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wager of sorts&hellip;I could use the money,&rdquo; he began, obviously struggling to breathe under her weight positioned on his rib cage.
 
 Lourdes rewarded Pettigrew by pushing her boot harder against his throat. &ldquo;What was that, Pettigrew? Please, feel free to interpret this as an interrogation. You know what an interrogation is, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said in her &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t this reasonable&rsquo; voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a definition: the withholding of pain on my part in exchange for information on yours. Well, let&rsquo;s see: right now I&rsquo;m withholding, but you aren&rsquo;t talking.&rdquo; 
 
 &rdquo;There&rsquo;s a bit of a pool going to see if he has to put a sack over your head or if he just turns you around,&rdquo; Pettigrew said nastily, attempting a smirk which was quickly replaced by a strangled expression and slightly bulging eyes when Lourdes bounced and shifted on his chest to knock the air out of him.
 
 She stared at him appraisingly for a moment, trying to decide what was really going on here.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It certainly wasn&rsquo;t the sort of sexual accusation she was used to, no one in OHK would have been fool hardy enough to mention the widely held suspicion that her unit commander liked to have her around the flat, or that she might have gone home from the bars with her old partner.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>There really wasn&rsquo;t much for Pettigrew to gain by that unless he was simply attempting to humiliate her because she was a woman.<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That in itself was rather self indulgent and stupid.
 
 Shifting her leg so she could lean in uncomfortably close to Pettigrew&rsquo;s face, Lourdes pursed her lips and shook her head disapprovingly. &ldquo;Some of us have the Dark Lord&rsquo;s best interests in the forefront of our minds, not our baser instincts. You might do well to reconsider your priorities&hellip;&rdquo;
 
 Lourdes slipped off, struggling to her feet and re-holstering her weapon as Pettigrew massaged his throat, looking entirely too calculating. As if trying to decide whether he was going to take his chances and retaliate, or just take her back where she came from.
 
 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get one thing straight Pettigrew. Within this organization, I&rsquo;m subordinate to two people: the Dark Lord, and Snape. And neither of them will be very pleased if you don&rsquo;t get me back right now.&rdquo;
 
 Pettigrew did a rather good impersonation of a simpering person, gingerly grabbing her clean wrist. With a pop she was back at the edge of the forest.
 
 &ldquo;Get out before someone sees you,&rdquo; she snapped, and Pettigrew, cringing, obeyed. Lourdes managed to hobble into the little clearing of trees and slumped against one to wait. The pain felt much duller than usual; bruises and broken bones were definitely supposed to hurt more. If Severus didn&rsquo;t get out here soon she&rsquo;d be a tasty, tenderized meal for whatever nasty creature was lurking in the bushes.
 
 
 -***-
 
 Severus found her sitting rather calmly in a stand of scrubby evergreen shrubs. He would have thought her dead if he hadn&rsquo;t been able to see her chest rise and fall just a little bit. A wave of relief washed over him, but did not completely remove the slightly twitchy feeling in his body, residual irritation from the Occlumency lesson, and his unbearable nervousness over her outing.
 
 The minute he got close enough to give her a firm poke with his wand, Lourdes reached up and groped with an ice cold hand for the chain with the Ghau on it. There was a brilliant burst of light and searing heat, and when the spots cleared from his eyes he saw Lourdes had been blown a good five feet away, judging by the trench in the snow and the fact that she seemed to be in significantly more pain.
 
 &ldquo;That was worth it,&rdquo; Lourdes panted. Color had returned to her skin with a vengeance, and between the bruises, cuts, and red flush from the cold, she was certainly not at her prettiest. 
 
 &ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; Severus had only just realized that he was gaping at her.
 
 &ldquo;Nobody covered me, and I&rsquo;ve never had to deal with that.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve always had the luxury of a competent partner. These morons kicked up so much dust with their curses that we couldn&rsquo;t see where we were going. I got surprised by an Auror and ended up knifing him before I caught a few curses to the back, and a broken leg I think. Malfoy was out of there like a shot, and Pettigrew of all people was the one who hauled me out.&rdquo;
 
 While the Dark Lord wouldn&rsquo;t be too happy to hear that Malfoy had been careless with his new toy (though this might bode well for Pettigrew), the real problem right now was how Severus was going to get her back to the castle in this condition. He might transfigure her, but prospect of that going wrong was a little too gruesome to contemplate, the Thestrals would lick at her wounds, and a stretcher would never make it across the open ground between the forest and the castle unnoticed. He was going to have to carry her.
 
 &ldquo;Give me your arm.&rdquo; Severus lifted one arm and gestured toward her.
 
 &ldquo;What?&rdquo; 
 
 &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t put you on a stretcher, and you obviously cannot walk unassisted.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>You&rsquo;re going to have to use me as a crutch.&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;This is going to take ages,&rdquo; she muttered, floundering through the snow to learn heavily on his shoulder as she favored her bad leg.
 
 With a grunt, Severus stood up, but he quickly discovered that aiding an extra nine or ten stone (he didn&rsquo;t dare ask how much, exactly) through the snow was harder than he&rsquo;d anticipated. 
 
 It seemed like a good idea at the time, he thought, but in hindsight his brain had figured out several really much easier alternatives. Why the hell hadn&rsquo;t he just used Mobilicorpus? If she complained he might have just knocked her out. The trip took three times as long this way, and Lourdes dug her fingernails into his chest every time she put too much weight on her bad leg. 
 
 Once they reached the forest edge, he scouted the grounds to see if anyone was out and about, but at this time of night in this miserable weather they were the only ones daft enough to be outside. If they hurried, he could get her in through the lakeside entrance with little trouble. 
 
 Once they were inside the castle, Severus dragged her through several dark halls until they arrived at his quarters in one piece; there&rsquo;d been no sign of the toad Umbridge anywhere and the portraits weren&rsquo;t about to talk. He deposited her into a chair, where she struggled out of the filthy Death Eater robes.
 
 &ldquo;Do me a favor and burn these for me, would you?&rdquo; She thrust the dirty bundle at him before starting to unzip the hidden seams of her sleeves and the legs of the suit
 
 &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; Severus muttered, stuffing them into the fire with a poker.
 
 &ldquo;Are you going to get the Healer?&rdquo; Lourdes asked, exhaling hard while she worked the front zip down, peeling the body suit off to the waist to reveal a snug undershirt and some mild bruises on her arms. In this light, he spotted another nasty bruise and cut near her hairline, as well as a very prominent gash across her nose and cheeks. Though for a fraction of a second he caught himself staring at the new view the undershirt provided&hellip;
 
 Automatically, his head snapped up and he tried to focus on the top of her head. Being constantly surrounded by females in two age brackets, too young, and too old for his taste had trained him to keep his gaze firmly anchored above the chin at all times. In fact, the whole world of feminine things remained blessedly remote. Though he would have given his left kidney for the assurance that he would never hear the phrase &ldquo;Professor Snape, I need to go see Madam Pomfrey, I think my&hellip;thing started&hellip;&rdquo; for the rest of his natural life.
 
 However, Lourdes fell into neither forbidden age bracket, and the pronounced change in her physique had been brought into the open in a most inconvenient fashion. Severus cursed whatever confluence of exercise and genetic material had given her the ability to transform the addict&rsquo;s body she&rsquo;d arrived with into something strong, lean, and vastly more appealing.
 
 Wait&hellip;Madam Pomfrey - why did that seem important? Oh, yes, her back.
 
 &ldquo;We will not need her,&rdquo; Severus said once he&rsquo;d gotten his wits back. Darting into the kitchen, he started flinging open cupboard doors to gather the potions and spell books he&rsquo;d need to patch her up.
 
 &ldquo;Someone has to put my leg right!&rdquo; Lourdes yelped over her shoulder.
 
 &ldquo;As long as the fracture is not severe I&rsquo;ll be able to take care of it.&rdquo; Severus set the little tray of things he&rsquo;d collected from the kitchen down and started thumbing through books to find the pages for pain killer spells.
 
 &ldquo;Are you out of your mind? What do you know about healing?&rdquo; When she lurched forward to threaten him, certain things&hellip; bounced, a motion that was apparently not possible in a swimsuit or robes. 
 
 He was quickly mortified to realize that she was obviously in pain and that it was probably incredibly improper to notice. 
 
 &ldquo;Death Eaters are hardly welcome at St Mungo&rsquo;s, Ms Mezarci. One learns to heal oneself, and I spent my first years out of school at Saint Magdalena&rsquo;s Apothecary. Turn around so I can have a look at your back.&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;Saint Magdalena&rsquo;s makes fancy soap and perfumes. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s Healer&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; she hissed. 
 
 &ldquo;They also make liniments and ointments,&rdquo; he replied, holding up a tin with the Apothecary&rsquo;s blue and white label as proof.
 
 Lourdes remained firmly in place, arms crossed stubbornly as he plucked a few live, light purple leeches out of their tank and set them in a reserve dish.
 
 &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t seriously going to put those on me, are you?&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;Leeches assist in the reduction of bruises. If yours are as deep as I suspect, the leeches will be more effective than any spell would be. Turn around, Ms Mezarci. That is not a request.&rdquo;
 
 She turned around to straddle the chair backwards, stripping off her undershirt (Severus&rsquo; brain launched itself into a mental recitation of the ingredients of the most gruesome potion he knew), letting out a hiss of pain when she tried to raise both of her arms up at once. Lourdes hadn&rsquo;t asked for a painkiller yet, which was&hellip;well, he wasn&rsquo;t sure whether it was bravado or something else. Her back was a mess, to say the least: deep black-purple and red bruises were swelling grotesquely all over, distorting the scarred skin. He couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a more thorough mood killer. After surveying the damage carefully for a moment, he began to apply the leeches in a neat grid.
 
 &ldquo;Are you covered, Ms Mezarci?&rdquo; he asked primly.
 
 &ldquo;Yes. Not that anything of interest is in any shape to be seen, or that there&rsquo;s all that much to begin with.&rdquo; Lourdes attempted a weak laugh and slumped over, her hand darting up to rearrange the fabric covering her as she rested her chin on the back of the chair. Severus had to kneel down to get a good look at her, pulling back the thick swath of hair that had come unpinned to inspect the big bruise covering her cheek, next to her &lsquo;bad&rsquo; ear. It sat under a scar he&rsquo;d never seen before that looked suspiciously like a bite mark.
 
 &ldquo;I have to tie this back,&rdquo; he said shortly, conjuring stuffing the hair back into her hat so he could apply the leech.
 
 &ldquo;Urgh,&rdquo; she objected, frowning as the leech got to work.
 
 &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been cut rather badly here,&rdquo; he muttered, applying purple antiseptic that hissed and smoked as it worked to clean out the cut down her nose.
 
 &ldquo;Lovely, now I&rsquo;m going to have to move the part in my fringe over further to cover this when it scars. At this rate it won&rsquo;t be fringe anymore, it&rsquo;ll be a curtain and I won&rsquo;t be able to see at all.&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;I hardly think so; I have some dittany tincture which should prevent any severe scarring. Is that not used in Turkey?&rdquo; Severus asked in a distantly disinterested tone as he disinfected the cut near her hairline, before applying a few drops of potion to the little cuts on her fingers.
 
 &ldquo;Ah well, when your manly male colleagues take you to the healers and give you a hard time about women not being cut out for the work because of their natural vanity, you sort of&hellip; opt against any treatment that might make you seem weak. Of course, some of these were beyond preventative treatment, so I&rsquo;m stuck with them anyway.&rdquo; Smiling weakly, she winced as the large cut across her face contorted. 
 
 &ldquo;Did I mention that Pettigrew claims there&rsquo;s a pool going to see if you prefer to bag my head to sleep with me, or if you&rsquo;d rather just &lsquo;turn me around&rsquo;?&rdquo; She laughed, but it rang a bit hollow in his ears- as if she wanted it to be funny but didn&rsquo;t really think so.
 
 Severus jerked back and looked at her suspiciously, but his brain was conjuring a rapid image of that second suggestion.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>No, he had to shake that off for now. &ldquo;How did you come to find this out?&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;Pettigrew tried to pull a power play on me, asked if you were &lsquo;fucking&rsquo; me. Naturally I threatened to give him brain damage until he gave me all the details; I ended up just giving a lecture on the Dark Lord&rsquo;s best interests. That should put a stop to that,&rdquo; Lourdes said crisply.
 
 He nodded in reply, a little worried that Pettigrew might be attempting to move up in rank as well. Just one more thing he&rsquo;d need to keep an eye on. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t so bad that you should be impairing your depth perception.&rdquo; Severus ran his fingers lightly over the spider web pattern carved in her cheek before aiming his wand at the long cut across her nose and cheeks.
 
 &ldquo;Severus, you don&rsquo;t have to talk down to me,&rdquo; she replied sheepishly, crossing her eyes to watch the wand tip travel over her cut several times as the skin knitted closed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m well aware of what I look like.&rdquo;
 
 If she really knew, Severus thought miserably, she wouldn&rsquo;t be so bloody casual about that undershirt and other people&rsquo;s come-ons&hellip;
 
 &ldquo;I resent the implication that I would attempt to appeal to your vanity. However little vanity you might have&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered, running a finger over the pale, smooth line that had replaced the open wound. &ldquo;Ms Mezarci, you act as though you are somehow seriously disfigured, but I see that you have all four limbs, both eyes, and most of both of your ears. Seeing as Moody is limping around on a false leg with a false eye, you should count yourself lucky.&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all well and good for Moody, men get away with that sort of thing in this line of work. Apparently I&rsquo;m supposed to do my work without picking up a single scratch or putting a hair out of place. You know, my nickname at O.H.K. in my later years was &lsquo;the hag.&rsquo; On account of my appearance, and my disposition,&rdquo; she said with a smirk.
 
 &ldquo;On the subject of name calling I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll get no sympathy from me. If I am not being addressed as Snivellus, I hear the student nicknames through the grapevine. Greasy git, big-nosed git, and overgrown bat being the most common,&rdquo; he said lightly, pausing to pick the gorged leech off the bruise on her face.
 
 &ldquo;Kids just aren&rsquo;t as creative these days, are they? What about the perennial Gryffindor-girl taunt &lsquo;slimy snakey Severus Snape?&rsquo; Or my favorite, &lsquo;Sevviekins&rsquo;?&rdquo; Lourdes asked innocently.
 
 &ldquo;I was under the impression you wanted to have your leg healed.&rdquo; He shot her a filthy look as he placed the fat, happy little creature back in its tank. Brandishing a tin of bruise paste that smelled strongly of mint, Severus began dabbing it onto what was left of the bruise. 
 
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what to think about Pettigrew though; there was something off with him. Kept running his hand down my side when we had to share a broom,&rdquo; she muttered, with disgust and contempt etched all over her face. &ldquo;Tried to go for a bit of a feel up right in front of everyone too.&rdquo;
 
 Severus knew what to think of Pettigrew when that revelation registered, and he imagined the scene. One eyelid twitched uncontrollably as he muttered something about murdering the rat if he ever touched her again. 
 
 Lourdes face softened and she gave him a strange little smile that actually carried through to her eyes. It really should have seemed like the smallest, most insignificant of facial tics, Severus thought nervously. Only there was something so familiar and warm in her expression, an apparent gratitude for his protective outburst mixed in with something that could only be described as oddly&hellip;alluring.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Thanks, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll need to.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m a big girl, I can handle it.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">She really shouldn&rsquo;t look at him that way; it gave him a very unnerving shock in the chest, and his hands felt three times bigger than they actually were. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Feeling extremely irritated with himself, Severus returned the tin to the table.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Dittany,&rdquo; he snapped, before he thrust a little crystal bottle at her. Lourdes sighed, and droppered some onto her finger to rub onto the scar.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile Severus removed the leeches on her back and fixed the ribs he suspected broken with a charm. &ldquo;Re-dress yourself and we will see about your leg.&rdquo;
 
 Severus turned on his heel smartly, folding his arms neatly over his chest, and used the time to try to force his skin to return to a normal color instead of gaping at her like an eager fifteen year old. When he turned back around, with Lourdes properly clothed and busy unlacing her boot, he avoided anything above her knees, focusing only on the injured area. Her leg was swollen and bruised, but on examination it seemed to be just a bruise on the bone itself, and not a break. The bone was fixed with a simple charm, and the bruising wasn&rsquo;t so bad that it needed leeches. A bit of paste would do just fine, so Severus thrust the tin at her and stood up quickly to replace the leeches and the other healing potions he&rsquo;d brought out.
 
 &ldquo;Something wrong?&rdquo; Lourdes asked, with an uncharacteristic shakiness to her voice. Probably just exhaustion, he thought.
 
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have no idea what you are talking about, Ms Mezarci,&rdquo; Severus muttered, as he put the top back on the leech tank and carried it to the kitchen. Much to his annoyance, his tried and true avoidant method wasn&rsquo;t working, he kept involuntarily reliving that soft smile she&rsquo;d given him.
 
 &ldquo;Alright then,&rdquo; she said quietly, popping the lid off the bruise paste and slathering a generous amount onto her leg. 
 
 Sharp, sudden pain pierced his skull sharply as if someone had just driven a railway spike into it; he was definitely in the first stages of a raging headache. Perhaps it was because he&rsquo;d spent the evening shackled to the incurably stupid Potter.
 
 Maybe, he thought, fighting the thick swimming feeling in his skull, it was that he&rsquo;d panicked at the thought of being without her. And he had no idea exactly what that meant exactly, only that the panic was not related to losing a spy. Some of it, at least, was because of Pettigrew; the thought of his hands anywhere on her body made Severus want to kill something.
 
 Suddenly mortified by that last thought, Severus felt himself go ugly, dark red across the cheeks and turned abruptly so that she wouldn&rsquo;t see. &ldquo;I will be making use of the bathroom, Ms Mezarci, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to wait,&rdquo; he said coldly, as if he were punishing her for something. 
 
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m covered in blood and whatever Dementors are full of, I think I&rsquo;ve earned a nice hot bath,&rdquo; she snarled. 
 
 &ldquo;Distressing as that sounds, I have spent roughly two hours beating my head against a wall. That is to say Potter&rsquo;s first Occlumency lesson was today, and in light of that I think that the right to the bathroom is mine. That, and the bruise paste needs set for at least a half an hour.&rdquo; He turned on his heel and made it to the bathroom in a few long steps.
 
 It was Friday, it wasn&rsquo;t nine o&rsquo;clock; this was not his scheduled time for a bath, he thought, as he discarded his robes and snapped the curtain shut around the tub. He contemplated the cold tap and his mental state for a moment before he twisted both and stepped in to a spray of comfortably warm water.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The sound of the water gave him enough mental solitude that he could linger and think as long as he liked without any distractions.
 
 Strangely, though, as he tried to concentrate, Severus thought that he heard faint, manic laughter carrying through the pipes. It must have been his imagination.</p></lj-cut>"

In the past few weeks leading up to the holidays, she&rsquo;d worked on forging the customs forms for Aberforth's Christmas gift.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out, having Mongolian goats imported to the United   Kingdom was much harder than it really should have been. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>She'd made a few attempts at writing to her contacts at O.H.K. on Albus' behalf, but always ended in her bed under a mound of blankets and her furry hat knitting socks while listening to Days of Destiny on her wireless unit. <br /> <br /> The socks were for Albus: three pairs of the pointy toed style popular in Turkey, knitted in lurid colors from her left-over yarn. Nomadic practicality and many long weeks between opportunities to do laundry had taught Lourdes that if there was anything everyone could use, it was more socks and underwear.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>In between stitches, she assembled profiles on the soap opera characters and ate out of the baskets parents sent Severus. One had to stay sharp, after all. <br /> <br /> Once it had arrived, Aberforth had been beyond delighted with his Christmas gift, a just-weaned nanny goat to replace the one he'd lost earlier in the year. In return he'd sent Lourdes a bottle of proper perfume, Borneo No 14 from the Saint Magdalena Apothecary, and a luxury hamper from Bon Vivant, along with twenty photos he'd bullied a patron into taking. The photos featured Aberforth cradling the brand new white kid, festooned with holiday bows and 'waving' its hoof at the camera. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>The best of these were taped to the inner lid of her trunk by the bedside along with his postcards to provide a view that wasn&rsquo;t of half frozen lake water.<br /> <br /> The perfume&rsquo;s function was rather obvious, and Lourdes rather liked having something feminine after avoiding it staunchly for years.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was the hamper that presented a problem; it was full of food, or rather things that had the potential to be food if you knew what to do with them. The most alarming contents were two blue-brown lobsters that waved their ribbon bound claws at her from their little box. There were also tins of Iranian caviar, old vinegar, smelly truffles and cheese, little chickens under a fresh preservation charm, &quot;vintage&quot; fruits and vegetables (what on earth did that mean?). The only thing Lourdes knew what to do with was the pomegranate, which was squirreled away to ripen. <br /> <br /> The only thing Lourdes could make, per se, was a ploughman's and instant heat Whizz Dinners (pull the cord and watch it cook!). She'd spent the past ten years subsisting on whatever was fast and handy, which usually meant street food and carry away. Her first thought on examining the hamper was that most of it was going to go to waste, but Severus poked through the contents and vanished into the kitchen with his copy of The Grand Dictionary of Cuisine. As it turned out, Severus could cook. <br /> <br /> While Lourdes did the dirty work of transcribing the events of the Dementor session, Severus did magic and turned some of the contents of the hamper into dinner; lobsters first aside a creamy sauce to top fresh pasta. Last night it had been Turkish figs stuffed with Roquefort cheese, and glazed in the thick balsamic vinegar, next to rice pilaf and the crispy-skinned chickens, cooked in wine and stuffed with grapes and herbs. A far cry from the school kitchen meat and two vegetables with a pudding they'd been sentenced to every night prior, and far nicer than anything she&rsquo;d eaten in the past few&hellip;well most of her life really. <br /> <br /> For lunch today, it was a pile of flaky croissant sandwiches with melty cheese, tomato, and fancy lettuce served with a great big pitcher of dry martinis, and a roaring hot fire which meant Lourdes could emerge from her mountain of blankets. She was just about to finish her third sandwich and martini, and was nowhere close to finishing the Dementor report for Lupin.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>She kept getting lost in writing detailed explanations of various magic theories that may or may not apply, in case Lupin wasn&rsquo;t up on his pure theory. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Severus was still working on the first half of his sandwich, and the second half of a gigantic Healers' reference book. <br /> <br /> &quot;I could get used to this,&quot; Lourdes purred, stretching back in her chair like a lazy cat before hastily swallowing her mouthful of cheese and tomatoes. &ldquo;On the job we never ate this well, ever!<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The closest I came was some pretty good carry away when I was in the masters program.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't have pegged<i style=""""> you</i> for a cooking person though.&quot; <br /> <br /> Severus looked up coolly and raised an eyebrow, as if he was not sure whether she was insulting or complimenting him. &quot;Why is that, Ms Mezarci?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;Well, there isn't a whole lot of power in cooking,&quot; she nodded, taking a hearty swig of her martin and savoring the alcohol burn on its way down. &ldquo;&rsquo;That&rsquo;s why I never bothered with it. No time, no point.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> &quot;You fail to see how presenting the proper image through food and drink impresses others?<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Not to mention being able to feed yourself&hellip;&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;You don't need to impress me Mister Snape,&quot; Lourdes said with a sly grin. &quot;I've already seen the contents of your underwear drawer, I'm afraid your reputation will never recover from that.&quot; <br /> <br /> He gave her an exasperated look as she reached for the last sandwich and another helping of martini.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;What? I&rsquo;m a growing girl!&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Growing<i style=""""> out</i>&hellip;&rdquo; Severus muttered.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Don't look so sour. I mean it&rsquo;s a compliment!<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>See that&rsquo;s the thing, all this? Fancy sandwiches, little decorations on the plate, it&rsquo;s a little more precious and artsy than I would have expected from you.&quot; <br /> <br /> Severus looked a little scornful as he took a hearty slurp of his martini. &quot;Cooking is not an art, it's a science.&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;I do love science,&quot; Lourdes sighed, resting her cheek on the heel of her hand and stuffing the last of her sandwich into her mouth. <br /> <br /> &quot;Speaking of science, Ms Mezarci,&quot; Severus said coolly, looking over the top of his book. &quot;I would like to&hellip; request your assistance on a project.&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;Oh?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;That MKIP program gave you access to Muggle fields of study correct?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;Certain fields, yes,&quot; Lourdes replied, taking a large, ungainly bite out of the new sandwich. <br /> <br /> &quot;What do you know about their study of the functions of the damaged brain?&quot; Severus continued. <br /> <br /> &quot;Physical damage wasn't really my field of study; though I had to take a few basic neurobiology courses when I did my masters. What are we talking about here?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;A regimen of potions to correct damage done by the Crucatius Curse, something more effective than the regimens they're using now.&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;I never pegged you for a healer either, Mister Snape. Is this about Damocles Belby getting that Order of Merlin for the Wolfsbane potion?&quot; Lourdes asked shrewdly, recalling some of his earlier rants on that subject.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">She wasn&rsquo;t the only person he&rsquo;d shared a productive rivalry with at school. Severus had it out for Belby in the worst way ever since Belby&rsquo;s paper won the Potions Club prize in fourth year, over Severus&rsquo; admittedly intriguing but off-beat treatise on poison cults. Belby was the golden boy genius, the Slug Club darling and the pride of Ravenclaw. Snape was the weird, greasy black sheep who did everything &ldquo;backwards.&rdquo; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Apparently their &ldquo;friendly rivalry&rdquo; had continued after school as well. <br /> <br /> But for just a fraction of a second there, she thought Severus looked a little wounded by her unnecessarily direct jab. <br /> <br /> &quot;Some of us, Ms Mezarci, have learned to value research and development for their merits unto themselves,&quot; Severus said, scornful again. <br /> <br /> &quot;Apologies, Mister Snape. What do you need my help for?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;I am asking you to assist me in the research because you come highly recommended. Albus was pleased with the work you did for him, and I,&quot; Severus paused and narrowed his eyes just a little, &quot;trust that you would keep me accountable.&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;What you mean is I'll triple check your work and I won't hesitate to skewer you if I think you've got something wrong?&quot; Lourdes couldn't resist a wide grin at that; she'd had the dubious honor of being his spell guinea pig in their latter years at Hogwarts. <br /> <br /> &quot;We'll be starting fresh on this project; I do not wish to piggyback on another formula this time. Those attempts have proven almost worthless.&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;Long term project, I'll do it. And I promise, once it&rsquo;s all figured out, I'll let your name go first on the papers,&quot; she said casually, but her smile didn't last long. <br /> <br /> Lourdes hardly heard her martini glass shatter because her left arm seared painfully, and a snowy location she'd never seen impressed itself sharply on her brain. &quot;Is yours burning too?&quot; she gasped, pulling up her robe sleeves to see the red brand had turned black on her arm. <br /> <br /> &quot;Get dressed,&quot; he hissed.<br /> <br /> The room flew into a panic as they rummaged in the wardrobe for the boxes containing their gear. Lourdes struggled into her Death Eaters robes and coif, cursing at herself for putting the gloves on before she'd laced her boots. Turning to rummage frantically in her chest, she stuffed the bundle of &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; ornament belts into her pockets, just in case, before Severus Disillusioned her and they were off. <br /> <br /> Luck must have been on their side, because they encountered no delays in the castle or down the drive. The moment they crossed the Apparition boundary line, Severus grabbed a hold of her, nearly crushing her forearm, and they vanished.<br /> <br /> -***- <br /> <br /> Severus looked around cautiously; they weren't as late as they might have been. In fact, they seemed to have been summoned first, as figures in black were still popping into the air all around them, trudging through the snow without exchanging greetings. <br /> <br /> They set off on the track already carved into the snow, running along the edge of a cliff, and ending at the door of a little shack perched above the slate gray ocean. Once they passed through the wards that barred the door, they found themselves inside the rotting building where the Dark Lord sat enthroned on a moth-eaten velvet chair by the dark fire place. Snow and brine leaked through the gaps in the architecture, making it that much harder for the small crowd of Death Eaters pressed against the walls not to tremble or shiver. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, Voldemort waved his hand and the group dropped simultaneously to their knees. &quot;Most of you know what lies just out to sea,&quot; he murmured, gazing pensively out the shack's lone, rattling window. &quot;Azkaban, the fortress guarded by our allies the Dementors. Many of you are also aware of, and benefiting greatly from, the fact that the world as we know it has yet to acknowledge my return&hellip; What a blessing it is that we may take advantage of the sloppy security measures that are now so common-place.&quot; Voldemort's red eyes surveyed the crowd of Death Eaters lazily, as if he were already deciding who to assign to the task. <br /> <br /> &quot;How I would hate to squander this opportunity; how I would hate to make my presence known any sooner than I have to. Not when the Ministry is so happy to turn a blind eye when my Death Eaters meet with one another for petty tortures... We will make the most of this.&quot; He ran one long finger over his lipless mouth before it twisted into a ghastly smile. <br /> <br /> &quot;Indeed, when you reach Azkaban the Dementor's powers will affect you; it is simply their nature to feed on humans. They cannot truly tell one person apart from another, but many of you have heard that we have a new addition. The rumor is true; we have been brought an Evocator&hellip;&quot; Voldemort pointed straight at Lourdes, picking her from the crowd easily and beckoning her forward. The sea of black robed bodies parted as she crawled forward and knelt at Voldemort's feet. <br /> <br /> &quot;My little lich will be responsible for the Dementors. With her soul displaced they will not affect her; she will be able to walk into their midst as if she were one of them. And she does have so much in common with them; a hunger for souls, and a bond with decay. I dare say that the loss of one Dementor will hardly be a tragedy. When the souls are released from the dying creature, the others will not be able to resist feeding, and they will care little for the rest of you. All you will have to fear are the Aurors. There are so few on the island that guards the fortress that my Death Eaters are sure to make easy work of them.&quot; <br /> <br /> He yanked back her hood quickly and tipped up her chin, boring into her eyes with his. &quot;I am right in saying, of course, that you are capable of placing yourself in lich state?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;Yes my lord,&quot; she replied in an oddly sweet tone. <br /> <br /> Voldemort looked up from Lourdes and smiled imperiously at the crowd again. &quot;We have Severus, of course, to thank for her presence. His loyalty to me drove him to the deserts to retrieve this little creature. It seems so many of you were ignorant of her while she was in our midst before. It is, of course, my hope that the rest of you will be more vigilant in finding me useful servants. Ah, Lucius&hellip;&quot;<br /> <br /> Voldemort called him forward with the twitch of a finger and Lucius stepped out of the lineup, kneeling next to Lourdes. If prostrating himself next to her as if she were an equal bothered him, he was careful not to let it show. <br /> <br /> &quot;You will be responsible for leading this expedition. I understand you are very familiar with the layout of Azkaban because of your visits to the Lestranges with your wife. We will need those Death Eaters of stouter stock and younger blood to endure this. You will of course take the lich, Avery, McNair, and Gibbon&hellip;&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;What about Crabbe and Goyle, my Lord?&quot; Lucius asked quietly, eyes still trained on the ground. <br /> <br /> &quot;I think not. This is a task that will require a bit more than brutal efficiency.&quot; Voldemort cast a rather disapproving glance over at the two largest figures crouched in a back corner. &quot;You will have to endure this without your personal retainers, so I do hope you are still capable of thinking on your feet. Snape, of course&hellip;&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;My Lord, if I might,&quot; Malfoy said quickly, his back and shoulders braced to receive a curse for daring to interrupt the Dark Lord twice. &quot;Snape, I think, will be tied up with the Occlumency lessons he is now obliged to give Potter, on Dumbledore's orders. Surely he could not escape the school in time to meet us&hellip;&quot;<br /> <br /> Severus felt the bottom drop out of his stomach; this was certainly not how he had planned on breaking that particular bit of news to Voldemort. Malfoy was striking out, kicking him down the ladder a few rungs, and making Severus extremely angry that he'd attempted to appeal to Malfoy in the first place. Voldemort's head snapped up sharply, and Severus was suddenly sliding forward on his knees as if pulled by a rope until he was up on the other side of Lourdes. <br /> <br /> &quot;And exactly when were you planning on sharing this with me, Snape?&quot; Voldemort asked, his voice even colder than usual. Severus took a deep breath and fixed his eyes evenly on the hem of the Dark Lord's robes. &quot;My lord, you instructed me to relay all information through Malfoy because of my position at the school, I obeyed. I hastened to tell him the moment I was given the orders by Dumbledore, though I do not know why Malfoy has delayed in telling you&hellip;&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;I merely wished to present this news at a time when Snape would be present, so that he might assist in devising a scheme to thwart these plans of Dumbledore's, my Lord,&quot; Malfoy said sleekly. Severus was burning with anger in the pit of his stomach at this deliberate stab in the back, but was quick to force it aside. <br /> <br /> &quot;My Lord, it is true. I have been instructed to teach the boy Occlumency, and the first lesson does fall on the night you have chosen to free our comrades. But you need not worry about Potter, my Lord. He is without a doubt the last person on the earth who will be able to master Occlumency. No one can lie to you, my Lord, not even from hundreds of miles away; I will not even have to pretend to fail at teaching him.&quot; Of that much Severus could be sure. <br /> <br /> &quot;Even so, Severus, give nothing away that might shield the boy's mind.&quot; Voldemort was giving him a very suspicious sidelong glance that made Severus slightly frantic to make up for this.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&quot;Could the retrieval of our comrades not be moved back only by a day, my Lord? Then I would be able to assist in this important task.&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;We have selected this date because Mondays are the only day on which there is a crucial gap in the Guard Aurors' evening shift change, while they review the upcoming week's schedule. Therefore it is essential that Monday is when we strike,&quot; Voldemort said. <br /> <br /> &quot;My Lord,&quot; Lourdes said softly, &quot;who will be charged with assisting me if Snape cannot come?&quot; Voldemort looked back at her with an almost bemused look on his face, as if he found her lack of practical magic amusing, and scanned the crowd. <br /> <br /> Suddenly Malfoy piped up again. &quot;Pettigrew, perhaps? My Lord, this would be the perfect opportunity to force him to prove his worth to you.&quot; <br /> <br /> Severus felt a fresh sear of anger in his gut; saddling Lourdes with a moron and a coward like Pettigrew? Malfoy was trying to get her killed. <br /> <br /> &quot;Perhaps&hellip; Fear is an excellent motivator, is it not? Pettigrew then, we will charge him with the lich's safety. Return without her body, or fail to return at all, and I will find you, Pettigrew. I assure you, your death will be a very, slow painful one for losing an asset this valuable. You cannot hide from me in your little animal body as you hid from your friends.&quot; Voldemort had a very nasty look of satisfaction on his face, as if happy to find a rock solid way of forcing Pettigrew to be useful. Severus thought he heard the faintest of squeaks coming from a corner in reply. <br /> <br /> &quot;Then we have Malfoy, Pettigrew, Gibbon, Avery, McNair, and the lich. That will make for fifteen when you have released the faithful from Azkaban. Malfoy, you will draw up the plans and review them with me before informing your comrades.&quot; <br /> <br /> Concentrating very hard to keep his breathing very even and low, Severus' mind was racing for a way to make a foothold out of Malfoy. Loyal to Dumbledore or not, he would not stand for being forced lower down the ranks and risk missing out on vital information. Severus stole a small glance the Dark Lord, and was struck by a bolt out of the blue. The diary- the one that Potter had destroyed. <br /> <br /> It had been entrusted to Lucius a very long time ago to be planted in the school when the time was right. That was part of the reason Severus was supposed to have been stationed at Hogwarts originally, as a gateway and a monitor for the Monster of Slytherin's progress purging the school. Dumbledore and Potter had suspected that Lucius threw it into the Weasley girl's cauldron to rid himself of ties with Voldemort, and to destroy Arthur Weasley's reputation. <br /> <br /> &quot;My Lord, perhaps I may be of service after all. The diary that you created to reopen the Chamber of Secrets- I would be able to place it into the possession of a student and we could see the Chamber re-opened. No one would know, my Lord, until you deem the time to be right. Dumbledore will not suspect me, especially if I place it in the possession of an unlikely child, perhaps a Hufflepuff. It will distract Dumbledore, he will struggle to explain deaths within his school, and will be even further discredited by the destruction of the Mudbloods. And the blow that it would deal to Potter if his Mudblood companion should die&hellip;&quot; Severus suggested breathlessly. <br /> <br /> Malfoy stiffened as soon as he heard 'diary,' and Voldemort seemed intrigued. He wore an expression of devious contemplation as he analyzed the merits of this plan. Suddenly Voldemort's face changed, a very sinister light came into his eyes.<br /> <br /> &quot;I smell fear Malfoy&hellip;why is it that I smell fear?&quot; <br /> <br /> Malfoy didn't reply, but the outline of his back rose and fell rapidly, like a cornered animal that knows it's about to be killed. <br /> <br /> &quot;Lich, Snape, back to the line,&quot; Voldemort hissed dangerously. Severus and Lourdes needed no further encouragement to push their way back into the crowd, for a front row seat to watch what was about to happen to Malfoy.<br /> <br /> Voldemort cracked Malfoy with alarming ease, forcing a confession word by painful word from his mouth, so that every Death Eater present could hear exactly what he was being punished for. Malfoy had dared to use a tool entrusted to him by the Dark Lord for his own ends, for something as petty as destroying a blood traitor's reputation.<br /> <br /> The series of tortures had a two fold purpose; to give Malfoy something to remember this by, and to show the Death Eaters a few more of the Dark Arts in his bag of tricks. While Cruciatus was a favorite among the Death Eaters, Voldemort favored more exotic fare. He made it an art, examining the effect of every curse the way an artist agonizes over each brush stroke. <br /> <br /> Like any interesting painting, this elaborate series of tortures delivered a message: that anyone who thought about using the Dark Lord for their own ends should think twice, and think much, much harder. Some of the curses Severus knew - most of them dealt excruciating pain to specific organs and nerves (without leaving so much as a mark on the skin). <br /> <br /> Severus stole a glance at Lourdes here and there to make sure that she wasn't going to have an inconvenient breakdown that might get them a taste of what Malfoy was experiencing. Her eyes were only narrowed slightly; he never saw her blink. She was watching Voldemort, not Malfoy. Voldemort had a grim, furious look on his features as he was about to deal his final blow. Scanning the crowd of Death Eaters, his eyes stopped on Lourdes, and a horrible smile spread over his face. <br /> <br /> &quot;Lich.&quot; He pointed to the ground in front of him and Lourdes hastened to kneel there. &quot;How much of your life did you give to retrieve the prophecy at your initiation? How many days did you shave off when you fed that ghost with your blood?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;Three months, my Lord,&quot; she replied, keeping her eyes fixed on the ground. <br /> <br /> &quot;Three months and she wasn't even mine yet,&quot; Voldemort said, in a contemplative tone. &quot;You do not know what you have destroyed, Malfoy, but you will pay for it with your life. I think&hellip;ten years should suffice. The lightest of sentences. But that, coupled with your punishment, should leave an impression. My obedient little corpse, take ten years from this unfaithful servant and give it to the master. Also, take the hair and blood you would need to spoil&hellip;&quot; Once he had pressed a conjured phial and a small parchment envelope into her hand, Voldemort's horrible smile settled firmly on his face as Lourdes knelt to pull the small silver knife Voldemort had conjured out of a holster on her boot. <br /> <br /> Malfoy was still struggling on the ground, prone as a newborn and in twice as much pain. Gnawing on her lip thoughtfully for a moment, Lourdes pressed the knife point just under his eye, as if deciding whether or not she hated him enough to cut him across the face. The blood came from his shoulder instead; she wiped the blade on his collar before cutting a spiteful chunk of hair from the very front, coiling it neatly into the little envelope. After handing the materials over to Voldemort, she turned back to Malfoy, one hand shooting out to grip his chin. <br /> <br /> The fear in Malfoy's face was completely undisguised now; as he struggled and gasped, pleading in mumbles for the Dark Lord's mercy. Anything, Malfoy swore, he would give the Dark Lord anything&hellip; As Lourdes muttered under her breath, Malfoy had his jaw clenched and his lips pressed together tightly as he struggled, both of his large hands wrapped around her arm, trying to pry her hand off. When she finished the incantation, his mouth was pulled open as wide as it would go, as if by a pair of invisible hands, while he made strangling noises and clawed at her chest. <br /> <br /> When Lourdes lowered her head over his and parted her lips, the whole room was filled with the exaggerated sound of Malfoy's forced exhalation as something very bright began to congeal above his mouth. Soft, pearly wisps of light shifted in a little cloud before twisting into a single strand, and breaking off from the rest of the glow visible in Malfoy's throat and mouth. <br /> <br /> She sucked the strand of light between her lips before dropping Malfoy, who lay in a gray skinned heap until the glow of life in his throat flushed back into his body. Lourdes held her breath as she knelt at Voldemort's feet. Slowly, he leaned over and opened the gash in his face, revealing a row of dirty, sharp teeth, before pressing his mouth to hers. The contact couldn't have lasted longer than a single, disgusting second, but Severus felt his stomach twist at the sight. Voldemort inhaled sharply before breaking away, the bright glow of stolen life vanishing as soon as it passed the neck of his robes.<br /> <br /> Voldemort rose and bared his mouthful of teeth at the crowd. &quot;That is the new price of failure. Fail your Lord and you will quite literally pay with your lives. Those of you awaiting instruction will receive them from Malfoy; I daresay he will not fail me again, or next time I will have the lich take everything&hellip; Go, you are dismissed.&quot;<br /> <br /> Severus cut through the crowd to snatch Lourdes' arm, and they Disapparated in a heartbeat. <br /> <br /> -***- <br /> <br /> She was shuddering uncomfortably all through the walk back from the Apparition boundary, eager to get the taste of Malfoy's life and the Dark Lord out of her mouth. Severus did not touch her; in fact, he ignored her as determinedly as was reasonable until he had to Disillusion her. Lourdes knew the life transfer disturbed him; hell, it disturbed her. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>It had been entirely too easy to hate Malfoy, all she had to do was think about the little girl with the diary. Malfoy gave it to her. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>She hadn&rsquo;t had to use her magic like this properly, formally in&hellip; in ages.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Since she was actively working with Capture Unit and she&rsquo;d taken life from a suspect to resuscitate a victim.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Having to do that spell was an ugly reminder of the other edge of her blade.<br /> <br /> Once they were safely inside his quarters, Severus flew into motion as quickly as he could, trying to find Albus. Lourdes forced herself to throw up and attacked her mouth with the tooth brush and a bottle of white spirit before heading for her trunk. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>After a moment of searching, and a second of panic, she found it. She had seen ex-wives cling to their wedding rings with the same ferocity that she clung to her O.H.K. manual. While she had never had a husband and had lost a family twice, there had always been her job, her education, and her organization. But O.H.K. shed her the moment she faltered. They did not need her the way she needed it. <br /> <br /> Even when there was no O.H.K. to rely on, she'd had a way to escape even if it was only into her head. What did she have now, she wondered, trying her best to combat the numb shock in her body. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">There was no organization, no escape, but she still had the books for structure. The manual was battered and dog eared; the inner leaves inked with passages from texts that had been comforting a long time ago. She went back to them now to see if the words still held any meaning in the middle of all this. Curled up on the floor by the trunk there was Jung; good, dependable, very dead Jung. His words spilled across one of the front leaves.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><i style="""">&quot;The sad truth is that man's real life consists of a complex of inexorable opposites-day and night, birth and death, happiness and misery, good and evil. We are not even sure that one will prevail against the other, that good will overcome evil, or joy defeat pain. Life is a battleground. It always has been, and always will be; and if it were not so, existence would come to an end.&quot;</i> The words were reassuring, not so much so as the pressure of warm arms or the vote of confidence from her superiors, but they did their job well. <br /> <br /> Every day is a war; this is the nature of life. She had seen the casualties, spread out across festering crime scenes that would make a civilian want to drop dead or at the very least throw up. She had learned to look at them without blinking, with a critic's eye searching for the hidden clues that solved the puzzle of whodunit. Then she thought about feelings; about rage, anger, and fear. Slipping into them like trying on shoes to get a taste for the victim or the killer, but rarely did she really <i style="""">feel</i> anything. <br /> <br /> She compartmentalized her emotions instead, inside the sort of well-ordered mind O.H.K. screened for. They wanted an ambitious mind too, happy to shed personal taste and non-regulation anything for the organization's ideals and rules<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Her wardrobe filled with uniforms, her offensively &lsquo;ethnic&rsquo; braids grown out at the roots and wrangled into a bun, perfume, makeup, anything that might make her stand out more than she did were shed. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Lourdes made the trade willingly, happy to be inside a structure, because within a structure if you played by the rules and followed orders you were supposed to be safe and successful. It made Lourdes feel unfathomably stupid for having abandoned herself and any hampering ideal, with nothing left aside from uniforms and a manual&hellip;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Flipping through the pages to basic rules of espionage. The most useful passages had been underlined ages ago, when O.H.K. had thought about using her to infiltrate a small growing Dark Arts cell. <br /> <br /> <i style="""">In the effort to integrate yourself with the target organization, the only action you are encouraged not to take, unless explicitly necessary, is to kill. All other action will be discussed with your handler. The operative is an actor playing a part. The operative must never confuse this part with themselves.</i></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">But these words left her cold, the instructions she&rsquo;d built her life around no longer flooded her with the sense of relief and comfort it always had, when its pages had been proof of what could and could not be done.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><br /> For a horrible, brief moment sitting there on the floor, Lourdes felt exactly the way she had when her family had died. As if the whole planet, every structure she had ever relied on, had just dropped out from under her feet, leaving her with no foundation. <br /> <br /> Lourdes thought about why she did it, about her old desk drawer- the locked one filled with padded leather boxes containing shiny enameled awards hanging on grosgrain ribbons, the ones they confiscated when she was sent to prison.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Lourdes counted the boxes in her head as she walked silently up the dark Head of House staircase behind Severus. The awards were beautiful, and her heart nearly burst with pride when she got to stand in front of a room of her peers to have that little box passed her way. &quot;You are worthy, you belong,&quot; was the message, loud and clear. She lived for it, lusted after it every second of the day. <span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But no matter how many she received, there never seemed to be enough&hellip;<br /> <br /> Sitting in front of Albus' desk in her chair while Severus spoke, she looked at him across the length of the desk, and felt right then that he was precisely that far away, and nothing more. Y<i style="""">ou are worthy, you belong</i>; that was the message they had both been longing to hear. That was the message that he'd been drunk on every time the Dark Lord looked his way, the same message she'd given up everything for with OHK. Was that the rhetoric that kept him loyal here under Albus? <br /> <br /> Albus was at first shocked, but gradually accepting as Severus continued to explain how the meeting had gone, and how at this point things were going along on the Order's track quite nicely. Lourdes' participation in the prison break would be rock solid proof of her 'usefulness' and in turn, rock solid proof of Severus' value as well. Voldemort was, predictably, pleased with not having to operate in the open and the relative safety of the guard island Aurors was still fairly guaranteed. Besides, as Severus pointed out grimly, the public could not very well keep its eyes quite so firmly shut once ten Death Eaters were on the loose. <br /> <br /> Most curious of all was how very interested Albus was about Voldemort's reaction to the diary's destruction. <br /> <br /> She spoke up in her own defense at the very end. This was Malfoy they were talking about here, and ten years were nothing to the Dark Lord. Lourdes maintained that she had not volunteered for the task or made the suggestion, she merely followed to avoid breaking cover. After all, she said, when you get into bed with the devil, sooner or later you have to fuck. <br /> <br /> In the end, both men had given her the wary look she had seen many times before, albeit from the inside of a prison cell. It stung a bit more than she remembered, especially when Severus seemed to be so close now. When she got up to leave, Lourdes tripped over the chair in her dazed state and heard a distant crack like wood breaking. The chair was alright, but Lourdes thought that something in her might not be&hellip; <br /> <br /> After that, she descended into a frenzy of tactical planning. In an attempt to quiet those nagging worries, she started putting together a packet on Azkaban - memorizing the maps of the island, studying the classified Auror response instructions 'borrowed' from Moody. When Malfoy's plans arrived, they turned out to be surprisingly sound, but whether or not anyone would actually stick to them was another matter entirely. Just to be safe, Lourdes spent several nights in the pool to practice swimming the distance between Azkaban and the Scottish coast in cold water, and spare time pushing and lifting as much weight as she could.<br /> <br /> Severus spent his time bouncing from meeting to meeting with any free Order member, trying to make sure that everyone knew what was about to take place. The Aurors had been understandably frantic but had agreed, with much coaxing from Dumbledore, to keep their mouths shut. Severus kept a cautious distance from her for the first two days after the Malfoy incident, but had slowly eased back into the usual routine. <br /> <br /> When he presented her a wine-poached peach with balsamic and vanilla syrup one evening after school dinner, she knew things were back on track. He&rsquo;d even consented to play dummy when she ran through wand-armed attacker neutralization drills, and affixed a plank of wood to the far wall so Lourdes could practice with her throwing knives.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Today the Wireless had been tuned to the loudest, most obnoxious station she could find, and the volume cranked to top notch, with some Dr Fillibuster&rsquo;s Fireworks set off for good measure in an attempt to replicate O.H.K.&rsquo;s stress inoculation training.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Her practice target had been enchanted by Severus to dart randomly around the room so she could continue to throw knives at it, although his idea of random was entirely too neat and tidy, Lourdes had worked out its pattern in the first twenty minutes and now it wasn&rsquo;t a challenge. <br /> <br /> Today was also Severus' last chance to tell Potter he had been assigned to teach him Occlumency, and he was guaranteed to be in a rotten mood when he got back. Just as Lourdes had shoved the furniture into the corners so she could run through a close quarters combat drill, Severus had come swooping into his quarters, clutching a small bundle of letters and a velvet bag. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Oi! Snape, be a sport and stand off,&rdquo; Lourdes shouted over the racket, cracking her knuckles and tossing her practice knife from hand to hand.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><br /> <br /> He answered by growling and slamming the letters and the velvet bag down on the table, readying his wand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, I see Black was present,&quot; Lourdes muttered, edging a few steps in either direction to get an idea of where his body actually was under the robes. <br /> <br /> &quot;Well of course, Ms Mezarci,&quot; he bellowed, &quot;after all, it is&hellip;his house. &ldquo;Vaccus.&rdquo; He shot a blank spell in her direction, just a bit of spark light he&rsquo;d come up with when she was training for the Hit Wizard trials in school. Lourdes snapped into action &ndash; it was still second nature - dodging down, around, edging closer to Snape with every missed spell.<br /> <br /> Lourdes sucked her lower lip between her teeth and chewed on it for a moment, watching cautiously while Severus&rsquo; anger built up to the point where he could no longer contain it as he tried to keep a safe distance from her. <br /> <br /> &quot;Aside from his springing on me like an animal, I must endure accusations that I am not trustworthy, that I have not changed,&quot; Severus growled, his face lit up with a rare, undisguised hatred. &quot;All this from a man who just got out of Azkaban&hellip;&quot; <br /> <br /> There was another round of hexes &ndash; live this time &ndash; that caught her on the hip. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>She pushed through the momentary burst of pain and executed a wand disarm wrist lock, twisting him backwards and off balance so he fell flat on his back and she dropped onto his chest and pressed her knife to his neck.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>One of the few upsides, even now, to all the time she&rsquo;d dedicated to O.H.K and the MLEs was that now, fighting was as natural and easily remembered as walking or breathing.<br /> <br /> Severus let a stream of rather creative expletives fly when she dropped hard onto his chest. Lourdes slipped off, feeling as annoyed as she had in school when he made a fuss about being tackled. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;My JAW, Ms Mezarci, hasn&rsquo;t worked properly since I met you,&rdquo; he hissed, rocking his head from side to side as if to shake off the disorientation. Groping for his wand, he silenced the wireless and the fireworks vanished leaving a crater of silence in their wake.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Fine for you to complain, but that last round was LIVE.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I didn&rsquo;t even hit you full force.&rdquo; Lourdes jerked the hem of her henley up to show him the purple weal on her hip. &quot;You know better than to let Black get to you,&quot; she muttered.<br /> <br /> &quot;A man only has so much patience. Mine, at the moment, is more than a little worn.&quot; He stayed on the floor, summoning the velvet bag from the table, and a glass from the kitchen before peeling the velvet off a crystal bottle filled with amber liquid. <br /> <br /> &quot;Since I&rsquo;m guessing you don&rsquo;t want to try a blindfolded round&hellip; how did it go at the Malfoy's?&quot; she asked, one hand grabbing the other behind her back for a stretch.<br /> <br /> &quot;No better,&quot; Severus said darkly, pouring a precise amount of brandy and tipping the glass on its side to test the level. <br /> <br /> &quot;Care to share a little of that?&quot; Lourdes raised an eyebrow and indicated the bottle with her chin. Grudgingly, Severus pushed the crystal decanter towards her. <br /> <br /> &quot;Whoa ho! Grande Champagne! How much is Albus paying you, and more importantly how on earth did you get a hold of this?&quot; Lourdes smirked and waved the absurdly expensive bottle of brandy at him. <br /> <br /> &quot;It was a gift from Malfoy,&quot; Severus sneered, taking a little sip. &quot;A very excellent way of reminding me of who is supposed to be the superior.&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;I see, he left the price tag on.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Doesn't matter who it came from, it all drinks the same,&quot; Lourdes declared, wandering into the kitchen to fetch a tumbler. <br /> <br /> By the time she'd plopped back on the floor and poured herself a measure, Severus was dangerously entrenched in sulky self-pity. His eyes were reduced to slits as he slouched against the wall, brandy glass under his nose to disguise his sneer. Sitting on the ground after a practice tackle with ill-gotten liquor, with Severus still sore about something Black had said, made her recall their study sessions by the lake. <br /> <br /> Now, as then, his sulking pricked at her a little; she wanted to chide him as if he were one of her too-sensitive subordinates. Though something reminded her that Severus rarely allowed himself 'feelings,' so she ought to just let him ride it out. <br /> <br /> &quot;I think you were saying something about the Malfoy's delightful little brunch with you; did anything useful come up?&quot; She raised an eyebrow and then the glass to her nose. <br /> <br /> &quot;Naturally, I had to play off the mention of the diary. Malfoy is much less unpleasant towards me in the presence of his family; of course, once we were in the sitting room all bets were off. He's quite smug now, says he has a source of information on the Potter brat. Information the Dark Lord is interested in. Narcissa seems to know about it as well; therefore I suspect it has something to do with Draco. No doubt bullying one of the other students. I'm obliged to keep a closer eye on him now, of course, to see if I can discover which student he's been pushing around and for what information,&quot; Severus said, in an annoyed tone. <br /> <br /> &quot;Any changes to the schedule or tactics for the operation?&quot; Lourdes smacked her lips and took the glass in one gulp, refilling it when Severus gave her a look of disdain.<br /> <br /> &quot;None whatsoever.&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;Have they found Karkaroff yet?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;Most definitely not. The Dark Lord encouraged McNair and his traveling companions to look for evidence of Karkaroff in his old haunts in Bulgaria after they'd spoken with the giants, but they naturally found no trace of him there.&quot; Right now he looked more miserable than she felt. As good as Severus was at all of this, it was clearly affecting him a little more than either of them would care to admit. <span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Most of the holidays had passed already and Severus, she had noticed, had not received a single personal gift, not even from Albus. Nor had he had cause to give any.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><span style="""">&nbsp;</span>No matter who you were that might be a depressing prospect in addition to the multitude of other things he had to be upset about.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Once again Lourdes was struck by that odd, squirmy sense of guilt she&rsquo;d had as a child when she realized how much she actually had compared to others&hellip;<br /> <br /> &quot;Wait here, Mister Snape; I have something I think you'll enjoy.&quot; She took the second glass in one swig and sprang up, feeling the sudden pleasant burn of light intoxication. Lourdes had been saving this as a bit of a bribe for the next time she had to do something disgusting in the field. But she decided now was as good a time as any to make an attempt at lifting Severus&rsquo; morale. Locating the key to the seventh compartment on her tiered locking chest, she popped it open and nearly fell in to the dark compartment in her eagerness to locate a particular object. Her fingers found it easily: a long, fat bundle wrapped in a silk piece-work tapestry of a peacock. Its contents had been a steady translation project that occupied her evenings over the last few years. <br /> <br /> Severus' eyes were closed now; he was absorbed in thought apparently. But his head snapped up very quickly when Lourdes dropped the bundle. &quot;Happy Mid-Winter holiday of your choice.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Personally I&rsquo;d go with Saturnalia&hellip;&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;What's this?&quot; he asked suspiciously. <br /> <br /> &quot;Open it and you'll see,&quot; she said. Severus put aside his brandy and appraised the outside first, very carefully running his fingers over the pieced silk covering and pulling it back to reveal a stack of rough, homemade paper sandwiched between two dark carved boards. Tibetan books were not bound, just sandwiched and wrapped up in a protective cloth before they were shelved.<br /> <br /> &quot;This can't be,&quot; Severus said obstinately. He cautiously removed the top cover and examined the first sheaf of paper, fingers a millimeter from touching it, while his eyes scrutinizing stylized drawings of plants and Tibetan script. <br /> <br /> &quot;Well, it is, and it isn't.&quot; Lourdes leaned forward and flipped through the first few pages to show her translations on the back of each leaf. <br /> <br /> &quot;First off, it's a copy of a copy of a poison book, and it's only half translated. Papa had his copy of the family book with him when he died. My grandmother had the original, I believe. The translation's been a side project for the past few years, not that I can do much more with it than that. I can stand to give you this copy because I haven't, and I won't, translate the khara sa-gdug potion- the life stealer. Everything else is in there though, including the poison doctor formulas, and the records of two thousand plants, one hundred twenty three animals and fifty minerals.&quot; <br /> <br /> He now had a strangely pleased, yet slightly offended look on his face as his eyes darted from the book to her. As if he could not figure out exactly what this gesture meant; whether it was a move for power, a display of knowledge, or something entirely foreign&hellip; <br /> <br /> &quot;It's not that I don't trust you!&quot; Lourdes said quickly, her hand shooting out to rest reassuringly on his forearm. &quot;Papa made such a big deal about keeping secrets in the family; he was the one that trained me to do the funerals and taught me to read out of the Evocator books. If he hadn't, well, I don't think even Albus would have taken me in at school. It was a big deal to him, you know? But trust me, if there's anyone in the world that could do the things in this book, it'd be you. I think even my Grandmother would have to tip her headdress to you on that.&quot; <br /> <br /> She smirked and raised her eyebrows. &quot;I hope it makes Belby and those other prats at the Potioneers Society cry.&quot; <br /> <br /> Looking slightly shell shocked, Severus flipped through each page slowly, scanning the papers as if trying to verify their authenticity, staring hard at the illustrations with the faintest of smiles. <br /> <br /> &quot;Do you think it'll be of much use? I don't know much about the plants, just what's translated there, but maybe there's something in here that could help with the Cruciatus potions?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;I won't know until I've read through it. I hardly have a clue at what's in here that I can use, short of the fact that it is a poison book&hellip;&quot; he breathed, squinting over an illustration of a turmeric plant.<br /> <br /> Lourdes wrinkled her nose irritably as she stood up; she certainly hadn't expected him to dance on the ceiling, but a thank you might be nice. After all, he did have a copy of a book that was never supposed to leave Tibet under pain of death. &quot;Well, you'd better be civil to me or I won't finish translating it.&quot; <br /> <br /> Just when she'd resigned herself to Severus' bland reaction, she heard the sound of his robes rustling. He was shifting on the other side of the book; lips pressed thin, and eyebrow knitted together in a look of utter confusion. His fingers twitched on the floor as if he were not sure of his next move, before draping his arms around her and jerking her forward. <br /> <br /> Lourdes' brain froze; slow to identify this gesture as &quot;hug,&quot; and quantify it as &quot;awkward, stiff, convex.&quot; Once the initial shock of the whole thing wore off, she was able to relax for a fraction of a second. <br /> <br /> Severus put his hands on her shoulders, simultaneously pulling back and pushing her away to look her in the eye. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said in a suspicious, bewildered voice. <br /> <br /> Lourdes felt her mouth move from a frozen &quot;o&quot; of surprise to a bemused smile. &quot;Any time.&quot;</p>"

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&quot;Ms Mezarci? Are you still there?&quot; There was a note of panic in Severus' voice, and it was followed by several very quick steps and the collision of two bodies trying to occupy one very narrow stair. 
 
 For a moment there was only heightened panic, and the dizzy spinning feeling of falling down stairs over top another person, along with the smell of singed hair and wool before they both hit a wall. When she got her eyes to focus properly <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> saw the torch a few inches away still blazing merrily, though everything outside that little pool of light was hopelessly dark. There was a fluttering sound, something whipped by&hellip; 
 
 &rdquo;<i style="""">Get the brank before she kills Ozama,&quot; one of them screamed. Seven, no&hellip;six men. Holding her down, resisting the urge to let go of skin as cold as ice. Her mouth stretched open and gagged by a heavy metal mouth piece, jaw prevented from opening by a series of straps. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>She was confused &ndash; she felt sluggish and drugged but her magic was trying to fight&hellip;
 
 &quot;Why can't we just cut her tongue out and blind her already?&quot; 
 
 &quot;O.H.K. wants her tongue and her eyes in tact, in case they need her. Get the brand&hellip;&quot; 
 
 The cell was huge, she was shackled, both wrists behind her back, a web of heavy chain tethering her to the back wall. Heat&hellip;there was heat. Pain, she could not scream. Sickness, she could not vomit. 
 
 Dark. Hot. Alone. 
 
 A hand&hellip;</i>
 
 Wait&hellip;a hand. On her wrist, hauling her up&hellip; Severus. 
 
 &quot;Shut them down, close your mind.&quot; She sorted through her brain, shut this down, close that, and forget that. When <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> finally managed to open her eyes it was still black all around, with only Severus' face under-lit gruesomely by the torch light. 
 
 &quot;Holy Dorje Bragsen,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> choked. She was cold; it clung to her skin like a wet cloak and made her feel numb. 
 
 &quot;There are three fully grown Dementors here and an untold number of going-to-be's,&quot; Severus muttered. &quot;This place is not a basement.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s a warren.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>We should be trying to find our way back to the stairs.&quot; 
 
 &quot;No,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said firmly. &quot;We're already down here, so we might as well gather as much information as we can.&quot; 
 
 Severus squinted at her unevenly, and looked as though he was struggling to choose between impulsive curiosity about the dark things hiding in the basement corners and the 'responsible' thing. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> folded her arms over her chest and gave him a challenging look, cocking an eyebrow as if to ask <i style="""">are you afraid?</i> Suddenly, he drew up another torch and passed it to <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>. 
 
 &quot;Try not to drop it.&quot; 
 
 They passed into an inner chamber after cautious navigation through the barrel ceilings and thick rough columns Severus's boot splashed in a puddle and <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> ducked to turn her light on it. There was something about half the size of a man growing like fungus there in a puddle of, there was no other word for it, filth. A scabby, skeletal upper torso covered in something that marginally resembled dead pussy yellow flesh (this flesh substance seemed to be a slightly more solid version of the puddle-filth), with arms and a hideous collapsed face. She felt her stomach turn sharply at the horribly familiar smell of a waterlogged corpse. 
 
 &quot;I wish I'd brought a camera&hellip;&quot; Severus muttered, shoving his torch into <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>&rsquo; free hand and pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket to cover his mouth and nose as he stooped to examine the thing. He didn't even flinch when the thing writhed in the puddle like a beached fish, opening and closing its mouth impotently. When its mouth opened again, it exposed something like a little jellyfish, waving clear tentacles around in the air as if feeling for something to feed on. 
 
 <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> felt her eyes widen and she leaned over Severus to have a closer look. &quot;Disgusting&hellip;&quot; 
 
 &quot;Fascinating,&quot; Severus said, balancing precariously on the balls of his feet as he leaned in. 
 
 &quot;Dorje! Severus, don't touch it,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> snapped instinctively. She was unable to shake the feeling that she'd just arrived on a crime scene and the forensic crew would be just around the corner to poke, prod and yell at anyone who breathed too hard. &ldquo;Where the hell did the bodies come from?&rdquo;
 
 &quot;There's no record of anything like this.&quot; Severus was staring hard at the mess as if trying to fix it in his memory for later perusal at his leisure. 
 
 <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> felt her heart jump like a frog in her chest; a Dementor had just passed so close that she could smell it. &quot;Do we know if Dementors have maternal instinct? They don't seem too interested in us&hellip;&quot; 
 
 &quot;If you've got your mind shut down properly neither of us should be giving the mature specimens much to feed off. For the young there's so much violent energy here I hardly think they need us. Perhaps the mature ones are more concerned with the offspring,&quot; Severus muttered, clearly aching to bring back some evidence of this disgusting discovery. &quot;Any species with vulnerable young benefits when the mature adults protect them. And these... things are clearly vulnerable.&quot;
 
 &quot;We can't leave them here like this,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> insisted. The basement seemed rather large, and she had no idea what the ratio of fully grown Dementors was to the puddle creatures. Which seemed to be partial human skeletons undergoing a very nasty refurbishment...
 
 Severus stood up slowly and huddled next to her by the thing in the puddle, eyes narrowed and lips drawn into a tight line as <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> handed him one of the torches. &quot;I don't really know that we have a choice. There is no method thus far for destroying a breeding colony. No one has been foolhardy enough to actually go into one before, or at least we have no record of anyone who came back out.&quot; 
 
 &quot;They hate daylight don't they? Can we blow a hole in the ceiling?&quot; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> said, holding the torch as high as it would go.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The dungeon rooms were all interconnected, smooth and slightly slimy with low barrel-vault ceilings.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>There was a wall at the end of this area, by the sound of it&hellip;<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><span style="""">&nbsp;</span>
 
 &quot;Oh yes, that would be easy to explain. Besides, I have no idea of this building's structural soundness&hellip;&quot; 
 
 &quot;Alright, so daylight's out.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Logic, Ms Mezarci, is what we need now. We are quite literally groping in the dark, and we do not know if there is a means for destroying them. They're like unforgivable curses, nobody's ever thought to do the research,&quot; Severus said scornfully. 
 
 &quot;Frazier&rsquo;s Law of Balance suggests that which is created must also be able to be destroyed; nothing is eternally enduring, save for energy, which only changes form,&quot; she whispered, reciting a passage from the advanced charms textbook, feeling a warm surge of strength at the recalled knowledge. &quot;Souls are a form of energy, do you think they're still rotting inside those bodies?&quot; 
 
 &quot;What we do know about Dementors is scarce. We know they breed and grow nourished by certain types of leftover energy, like wraiths and shades, anywhere there was bloodshed or misery, or dark arts. Their favorite form of sustenance is positive scale emotion, the soul and accompanying concientia - but what nourishes them destroys them as well. They can be repelled with the Patronus charm.&quot; Severus paused and nudged the thing in the puddle with the toe of his boot, and it flopped pathetically. 
 
 The minute Severus touched the thing in the puddle, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> could hear the whipping of fabric, and the indistinct hoarse whispers swooping around them. What were they waiting for? &quot;Alright, that's a start I suppose. What do we know specifically about their breeding, Professor?&quot; she muttered. 
 
 &quot;We know this building is on a ley line, a very long history of violence and Dark Arts, and an unusually strong population of wraiths and shades. What do we know about wraiths and shades?&quot; he countered. 
 
 &quot;Wraiths and shades are like poltergeists. A high concentration of emotional energy- sadness, torture, depression- makes wraiths and shades. It&rsquo;s difficult get rid of them permanently, they just re-manifest as long as people occupy the building.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Sitting on top of a ley line might speed that re-manifestation, mightn't it?&quot; 
 
 &quot;Now that you mention it&hellip;it probably would.&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> stopped and tried to put all that together, but Severus took a step forwards and she was forced to move. 
 
 &quot;Dark Arts activity leaves residual trace energy, and this place was absolutely soaked in it,&quot; Severus muttered, running his finger over the wall. &quot;Perhaps it is time to consider the Law of Opposites. If Dementors breed in water and cold, heat and fire should be a suitable deterrent, should it not?&quot; 
 
 &quot;If the Law of Opposites is correct then it should be&hellip; I could try to unravel the wraith and shade manifestations here, that ought to cut down the things the young ones are feeding on. Do you think it could weaken them enough?&quot; 
 
 &quot;Let's not take any chances; we ought to take the mature ones out first. How were you planning on disposing of them?&quot; 
 
 <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> held up the knife she'd had stuffed in her pocket. &quot;Violent disruption, of course. They have bodies, so I figure if I can do enough damage, it will break whatever hold it has over the sucked souls. Works on everything else with a body, right? If you cut open the stomach the contents spill out.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Release the souls and you are essentially dumping food all over the new creatures.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Then we'll have to act in advance. What if I drew up a dual ward system first? One to do a mass banishing of the wraiths, and then I'll activate another to banish the souls? If you can corral all three Dementors in one corner with your Patronus, I can use that as a cover to go in. Once we've got all three bodies destroyed, I can activate the wards and remove as much of the energy the Dementors are growing on as I can. What do you think?&quot; 
 
 &quot;If we can throw them sufficiently off balance, I can attempt to maintain a hermetic fire,&quot; Severus said softly. &quot;We need enough light, and enough heat to destroy the breeding bodies and dispel all shadows but the ones we cast. It won't damage the integrity of the building though.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Fiendfyre? Do you think it will work? Hermetic spells need a fair punch behind them, don't they?&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said fretfully. 
 
 The last time she'd seen an attempt at a hard-line hermetic element spell, it was at the cleanup of a disastrous water spell that nearly drowned a whole neighborhood. It had been cast by a cracked old wizard who thought he was going to cleanse the neighborhood of the 'filthy' Muggles. The catastrophes department had a hell of a time trying to cover that up as a burst water main. These weren't the sort of spells you just tossed off when you wanted to water the garden or light the fireplace. 
 
 &quot;Unless you know of any other method, this plan is about as good as any other,&quot; he said. 
 
 &quot;Now aren't you glad you paid attention in Charms?&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said, in a weak attempt to lighten the mood. 
 
 Severus found a reasonably large work space in the middle of the basement area with the highest activity, and began laying down patches of bluebell flame to give <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> enough light to work. With her phurba knife clamped between her teeth like an over large bit, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> knelt on the floor and began drawing out the wards with a stub of chalk and a bit of string. 
 
 One large circle she filled with a carefully calculated logarithmic spiral and one of the longest spells she knew, and for the other she drew a series of concentric circles with spells written around the edges. Severus was setting up a protective line between the two to keep them from being burnt to a crisp at the end. Everything looked good from here, even in the dim light. The last touch was a thread trap off the ornament belt in her coat pocket: a set of carved cross sticks with silk filaments wound around them, placed in the very center of the concentric ward. 
 
 &quot;They've been awfully quiet&hellip;&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said suspiciously. 
 
 &quot;Well, I'm afraid we're just about to put an end to that, aren't we?&quot; Severus muttered, cracking his knuckles and fidgeting with his wand. 
 
 &quot;Are we at all sure this is going to work?&quot; 
 
 &quot;No,&quot; he replied grimly. 
 
 &quot;Well then, here goes nothing,&quot; she said, shrugging off her coat and wadding it up in spite of the cold. It would be easier to move this way. 
 
 &quot;Whenever you're ready&hellip;&quot; 
 
 &quot;Do it,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said firmly, shutting down every coherent thought except <i style="""">kill</i>. 
 
 &quot;Expecto Patronum!&quot; 
 
 A silver fallow deer, a doe judging by the lack of antlers, emerged gracefully from the end of Severus&rsquo; wand and loped across the room, lighting up the three Dementors hunched low over a puddle by the odd back wall. The spindly legged creature wove circles around the crowd and the puddle, throwing the Dementors into a state of confusion. They didn't run from the Patronus though, they seemed bound and determined to keep it away from the young.
 
 In a flurry of motion, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>' hand shot into the hood of the closest Dementor and closed around something that she reasoned was a neck, and she took a stab. Contact - the heavy knife sunk through the spongy flesh and brittle bones as easily as a tent stake anchored in sand. Was it screaming? If a Dementor scream sounded like a high, shrill, ringing alarm then it was definitely screaming.
 
 Giving the knife a sharp twist, she felt the Dementor's bones crack. She hit it again, and again, eyes narrowed against flying bone and flesh until she'd created a gaping, ragged hole in the creature's body. It sank to the ground, giving <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> the chance to grab its head and twist it, to hear the sharp snap of a spine breaking. The scream was replaced by an incoherent babble as a swirling silver mass escaped through the hole in the chest. Centuries of souls, reduced from separate entities into one rotted, indistinct mass. 
 
 There was a heavy bruising pressure around her neck: one of them had its hand on her throat. She tried to press her chin to her chest, her free arm sweeping across the dementor&rsquo;s as she twisted out of the grip.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The Dementor sucked desperately at the air as <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> struggled to keep her mouth shut.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>
 
 The knife made contact, and <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> dropped to her knees, dragging it down with her weight before she heard the sick shattering noise again. The Dementor gasped lamely, as if making one last attempt to take her soul, before it dropped too. She reached out to get at its head, but fell over on her elbows. 
 
 The Patronus was pawing the ground and rearing to try and repel the remaining Dementor which was reaching for its hood&hellip; 
 
 She was fighting a loosing battle with her mind which was suddenly swimming with miserable images, <i style="""">Aberforth's face frozen in an anguished howl, the six patrons holding him back as the edges of her vision went dark. He was getting further away, she was being carried away</i>. <i style="""">There was a horrible ache in her chest, her heart was breaking&hellip;</i> 
 
 There was a sharp shattering sound. When <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> uncovered her eyes, and saw the last Dementor's chest had been blown wide open &ndash; and so had the wall behind it. She wasted no time, snapping the two remaining necks before springing up. She ran right into Severus who'd had to get very close to use that curse, and he caught her under an arm and pulled her back into the center circle. 
 
 Keeping rhythm with her hands, her whole body swaying smoothly, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> chanted, blocking out everything but her work. The spiral in the first ward started to glow, the ward lines lighting up as she worked. The silver clouds released from the Dementor's bodies were being pulled into the ward, swirling around like a vast milky galaxy as a mirror image of the ward etched itself in bright light at the ceiling's height. When the entire ward was lit up, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> changed rhythm and the silver clouds began to twist as it was sucked through the ward on the ceiling. The ward exploded in a burst of light like a dying star, before it collapsed into itself. 
 
 <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> felt a hot rush of satisfaction at seeing a spell completed under her watch, and she turned to the next ward. Shades and wraiths were easy work; as soon as the ward filled up to the center circle with a crackling cloud like static lightning, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> knew she had them all. Reciting the spell carved into the thread trap, she sent it spinning. As the thread flew off the cross sticks, the cloud itself seemed to unravel as well, changing from a crackling tendriled mass to a soft mist that funneled into the ground.
 
 When it went dark she heard the sharp snapping of wood, a sign that the cross sticks had cracked and the spell was broken. 
 
 &quot;Now that the distractions are out of the way,&quot; Severus said, pushing up his sleeves and rolling his neck to either side. He flicked his wand towards the ceiling, holding it so his index finger pointed upwards as well. 
 
 &quot;Creo Ignem.&quot;
 
 The initial searing blaze of heat was followed by a soft coolness, the protective line activating itself. Ghostly blue runes glowed on the floor, their soft light extending up to a smooth blue circle that floated in the air just above Severus' wand. Through the barrier she could see the whole floor lit up with molten heat that bubbled and lapped up the walls, shifting form elegantly.
 
 Slowly, steadily, it enveloped the whole room in waves, and turned the corners to seep into the next room and all the corridors. It was a beautiful spectacle; capering flame-forms of all manner of grotesque nightmare creatures blazed gold and orange, swirling and leaping across the walls and ceiling, and cascading down to the floor like rain. They seemed to be having a marvelous time, if such a thing were possible, while Severus kept his eyes narrowed in intense concentration. If anything survived this onslaught it would be a miracle. 
 
 The fire ebbed away obediently, and when it slid back down the walls the air was clear, the atmosphere was normal again. 
 
 &quot;Finite.&quot; He looked a little pale and sweaty from the obvious effort and took a none-too-stable step forward in an attempt to collect himself. This time, she caught him.
 
 -***-
 
 She hardly flinched when she caught him under the arms and braced him while he got his legs back. With his face buried in her neck and her mess of hair he could smell soap mixed with something even worse- like decomposing flesh. Or more specifically, Dementor&hellip; 
 
 &quot;Say what you will about my bathing habits, Ms Mezarci, but on my worst day I never smelled anything like you do now,&quot; he coughed, pushing himself away and taking a step back to have a look at her in the wand light. Her clothes were covered in some viscous substance they'd just now noticed. 
 
 &quot;I don't even want to know what this is,&quot; she winced. &quot;A little help here?&quot; 
 
 &quot;Tergeo,&quot; Severus muttered, taking care to make sure every bit of the mess was removed for the sake of his sense of smell. He'd gotten a fair bit of it on himself when he landed on her. 
 
 <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> paused, face frozen in an attractive expression of contemplation as if she were sniffing the air for something. &quot;Mister Snape, I think we've done it.&quot; She was right - the basement was&hellip; normal. The air was clear. Severus rushed up the stairs to see if he could spot her from the top, and there was no trouble at all; the little electric light switch even worked now. 
 
 He felt oddly buoyant as a vision of the Order of Merlin, glittering in its velvet and leather box, danced in his brain. Rushing back down the steps he stopped dead to give her a very serious look. &quot;You do realize, Ms Mezarci, that we are probably the first people on record to have successfully destroyed a breeding colony of Dementors?&quot; 
 
 Before he knew it those wiry little arms were wrapped around him, nearly crushing his rib cage, before he was hoisted off the ground for a moment. &quot;This was GENIUS,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> snarled into his neck. Dropping him back on his feet, she pulled back and flashed him a wild expression.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">There was something about the intensity of her expression - an exhilarated half-grin when she locked eyes with him - that sent a shockwave straight through his body.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It burned, flushing him with an inexplicable heat and ignited a sudden barrage of half-formed images and impressions that were in and out so fast he couldn&rsquo;t make much sense of them.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>All he knew was that it felt&hellip;good.
 
 The sight of her tattoos brought him firmly down to earth. She was an Evocator; they'd just theoretically broken about five go-straight-to-Azkaban laws. That little leather and velvet box went up in mental flames&hellip; With a sour expression, he wrestled himself out of her grip and smoothed his sweater back down. &quot;Be that as it may, I doubt the Ministry would see it the same way.&quot; 
 
 <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> frowned, and flopped down on the ground to re-holster her knife. &quot;Good point. At least that fire burned off everything on the floor, and the thread trap. I've honestly never seen anything like it- was that one of the Dark Lord's old tricks?&quot; 
 
 &quot;However did you guess?&rdquo; he muttered. 
 
 A brief investigation of the house was further proof that they'd succeeded; everything was as clear and bright as could be expected out of a Muggle-built Gothic Revival castle.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The wall he had blown out seemed to have been erected to cover a hilariously fake looking shrine in the fashion of Druids festooned with skulls and a goblet, but more ominously, there was a gaping hole behind it that Severus and <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> decided not to explore.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was the remains of an informal charnel house, from the plague days.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Where the Dementors had gotten the bodies.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Severus hastily re-erected the wall, and <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> declined to do anything, insisting that spirits, and not long-dead bodies were the real problem.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">
 &quot;That's a very interesting change to your Patronus,&quot; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> said in a sly voice, verging on a snicker as she locked the house door. She must have been doing her best to remain composed but she had her lips pressed together tight and her cheeks were pink as if she was trying very, very hard not to laugh.
 
 &ldquo;It works, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said coolly
 
 &ldquo;Yeah&hellip;.I suppose it does,&rdquo; she snickered this time, hiding her strained grin behind her hand before all composure failed her and Lourdes let out a long, derisive howl of laughter. She was laughing so hard in fact that there were tears gathering at the edges of her eyes and she had to lean against the castle to stop her self from falling down.
 
 Severus looked at her as if she&rsquo;d gone quite mad, and <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> flapped her hands urgently at him, stammering something about &ldquo;Gotta breathe, gimme a sec&hellip;&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">
 When she finally collected herself and wiped her cheeks with her coat sleeve, <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> offered something in the way of an explanation. &ldquo;Sorry, its well&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t it a fox before?&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; Severus said stiffly.
 
 &ldquo;Gods, see, when I worked in Capture Unit they had everyone doing the Patronus charm just in case, because there were some rumors they were breeding in Bulgaria and it was quite a scare. But Ozama, biggest bloke I&rsquo;ve ever met - neck like a telephone pole and this big bull chest and shoulders.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><span style="""">&nbsp;</span>I mean here we are expecting this huge ferocious Patronus and what pops out of the end of his wand? Butterflies! A big cloud of BUTTERFLIES. We reckoned it was going to be something that matched him, a bear or something but&hellip; Dorje, we didn&rsquo;t let that go for WEEKS, I mean people were charming them to fly around his desk, or hiding them in his locker. Ozama was a sport though, turns out his dad was an entomologist and used to take him to Oludeniz during the butterfly migrations. But when it got out that Degmez&rsquo;s Patronus was a peacock&hellip;&rdquo;
 
 Severus raised an eyebrow disapprovingly at the thought of <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> and her cadre of coworkers taking the piss out on some poor man thinking about his father. &ldquo;And how well did they respond to your inability to produce one?&rdquo; 
 
 &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t an issue, during the scare I kept a Tngri, a fire spirit, bound on my blood. You can summon them in a snap if you&rsquo;re willing to pay properly.&rdquo; She pushed her coat aside and tugged on the waistband of her jeans to show him a bruise colored mark and a blurry bit of foreign script. &ldquo;You use a charmed fang, sink it in somewhere and seal the charm. As long as one of them decides you&rsquo;re suitable and if you aren&rsquo;t afraid of loosing a teaspoon&rsquo;s worth of blood every day you&rsquo;ve got a dead handy companion on your hands for immediate materialization. It&rsquo;s a lot less risky than trying to bind a demon or something else that&rsquo;s constantly shifting form and perception. Tngris are reliable&hellip; They broke my charm when I went to prison though,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> sighed. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I might see to putting it back in actually&hellip;&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;And pray tell what form does your little fire take?&rdquo; he sneered.
 
 &ldquo;A tiger, if it likes,&rdquo; she said brightly. &ldquo;That was my Papas Patronus as well. I mean not that yours is <i style="""">funny</i>, but it&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;d expect. I would have thought the fox had stayed, or maybe bats or something like that. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>It&rsquo;s not really weird, but I mean, it is a bit dainty.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>What do you think about? When you cast it?&quot; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Her expression changed for a moment, becoming intense and focused
 
 &quot;The night I came back.&quot; Severus said shortly.
 
 Tilting her head to one side, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> looked at him as if he were a rather meaningful work of art, before she hooked her arm around his. &quot;Let's go.&quot; She sighed and butted her head against his shoulder affectionately. &quot;I sort of missed you.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Oh,&quot; he said slowly, not entirely sure how to feel about that statement and all it implied.
 
 &quot;I came back because I missed everyone. I missed Aberforth, I missed you, and I even missed the bloody goats.&quot; 
 
 Severus knew this was true; he felt that ugly thump in his chest again. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> turned her neck in the other direction to crack it and then looked mournfully at the dirty snow lining the driveway. &quot;Its cold.&quot; 
 
 &quot;It's winter,&quot; he replied thickly. 
 
 &quot;I should get used to it, you know? It's much colder in <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Tibet</st1:country-region></st1:place>,&quot; she sighed. 
 
 &quot;What's in <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Tibet</st1:country-region></st1:place>?&quot; Severus asked cautiously. 
 
 &quot;Goats.&quot; 
 
 &quot;And what precisely do goats have to do with you?&quot; 
 
 &quot;That's where we're going, Aberforth, me, and a whole mess of goats, when all this war rot is over. I think he's sick of the pub, and <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Tibet</st1:country-region></st1:place> is the only country that hasn't got laws against people like me,&quot; she said winsomely. &quot;We'll have one of the nice proper houses and I'll keep up my buisness.&quot; 
 
 Something cold and slimy invaded his gut, resentment or betrayal perhaps. She was barely here and she was already talking about leaving. Why should I care, he thought rather bitterly. If she wanted to leap from one dead life to another, it was no skin off his nose. 
 
 &quot;I've seen pictures of <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Tibet</st1:country-region></st1:place>; its all rocks and scrubby little trees. Not hard to see why your father left.&quot; 
 
 &quot;No, my father was from the south east, all jungle. I&rsquo;ve still got distant relatives there, but I they&rsquo;re not worth meeting. Rotten, inbred purebloods I&rsquo;m told. Nearly bled Papa dry of magic when he tried to get the books for me. Papa though - left fulfilling a life debt to a French witch, acting as her guide out of the country. She was off her nut, trying to sneak through the country dressed up as a beggar monk and nearly got herself killed when my Grandmother slipped a little poison in her tea to try to steal her magic. Not that I blame my Grandmother, her family was all Dugma poisoners, apparently never saw the merit in wasting magic on morons. I think I told you how he ditched that French witch when he saw Mama in <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Tashkent</st1:place></st1:city>. Ran off and married a woman he fell in love with at first sight. They just sort of kept going after that&hellip;&quot; She smiled, soft and warm this time. 
 
 &quot;Your father came from a Dugma family?&quot; How the hell had that escaped him? The Dugma's poison book was one of the most coveted, lusted after texts on Tibetan plants and brewing methods in existence, prized because foreigners were barred from <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Tibet</st1:country-region></st1:place> as a rule, and there was an automatic death sentence for anyone caught removing texts or artifacts. Every so called poison book that had made it out turned out to be a poorly imagined forgery or a disguised Sutra.
 
 Severus still laughed when he remembered the very public humiliation of Dagworth, President of the Extraordinary Society of Potioneers. It had been at a meeting when Dagworth blustered that he was going to unlock the secret of the Dugma method for stealing life and magic. He spent two hours detailing a very unlikely adventure where he snuck into <st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Tibet</st1:country-region> by way of <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Mongolia</st1:country-region></st1:place>. 
 
 He claimed to have rescued a Lama from a Yeti, and apparently the holy man was so grateful he gave Dagworth his 'most precious possession,' the mystical book of the life stealing poisoners. Dagworth presented it with pomp and circumstance, inviting a notable Himalayan scholar to examine it in front of the crowd. When the scholar flipped open the cover of the &quot;Poison book&quot;, he read off the first few lines of the Heart Sutra. Dagworth's face had gone purply red like a slab of bad meat when Severus' laughter rang out loud and started the whole room cackling, even Belby, the stuck up git, had gone on doing impressions of Dagworth over pints for ages. 
 
 &quot;I'm sure I told you that.&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> screwed up her face as she thought through it. &quot;I know I told you that. Within the first couple of weeks of Occlumency.&quot; 
 
 He indulged in a very satisfying little fantasy in which he paraded not only a Dugma descendant, but a real copy of the sacred text in front of a room full of potions rivals and nay-sayers. Relishing the imaginary looks of deepest envy and awe on the faces of incurable snobs like Dagworth, Slughorn, and Belby&hellip; Ha! Wolfsbane potion <i style="""">that</i>, Belby&hellip;
 
 Suddenly he could see it again: Severus Snape, Order of Merlin, first-bloody-class for outstanding achievement in the potions research sector.
 
 &quot;<st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Tibet</st1:country-region></st1:place> is really all I have left,&quot; she said in a small voice. Severus paused, and looked at her; she didn't mean that. He knew it; Severus was getting rather good at reading between her lines. She said &quot;<st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Tibet</st1:country-region></st1:place> is really all I have left,&quot; and she meant &quot;tell me you want me to stay.&quot; Severus had to wonder if she could read him as well as he could read her. 
 
 &quot;Before you go anywhere, Ms Mezarci, to <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Tibet</st1:country-region></st1:place> or to anywhere else for that matter, I expect you'll have to finish the report on exactly what we did here today&hellip;&quot;</p>"

 <b>To Heat and Frost</b>
 
 <i>Woe to you, wicked souls! Hope not ever to see Heaven! I come to carry you to the other bank, into eternal darkness, to heat and frost. - Dante, The Inferno</i>
 
 Severus prowled the aisles of his fifth year Potions class fighting the urge to yawn or show any sign of fatigue. When he began teaching some fourteen years ago, the epidemic of ineptitude Severus saw in the sea of dead eyed children inspired a sort of artistic devastation. Now teaching was one of those chafing annoyances, like a pebble in one's shoe or an itch at the back of the throat. 
 
 All they had to do was follow the instructions on the board; it wasn't as if he was asking them to write an existentialist novel or cook a flawless souffl&eacute;. Invariably, essays were sloppy and the class work was dismal with very few exceptions. If there was a purgatory worse than being forced to teach an art you excelled at to students who did not care, Severus could not think of it. Happily, Albus did not much care how he taught the lessons so long as the abuse remained verbal; apparently he operated under the idea that certain un-pleasantries 'built character.' If that was the case, Severus was the master character architect. 
 
 He had eventually figured out how to enjoy himself on the job: by seeing how hard he had to squeeze the students to get a worthwhile result. Children were like grapes really- the harder you trod on them the more juice you got (and he might as well have been teaching raisins). Stifling another yawn, Severus drifted back up to his desk to have another drink of coffee, a beverage he only resorted to on the worst days. Today was bad because last night had been worse. 
 
 Arthur Weasley had been attacked, but stranger still was the way it had been discovered. Potter (Severus was only half aware of the growl that escaped him at the mere thought of the brat) had dreamt he was the snake that attacked Arthur. Then Potter ran straight to Minerva, who ran straight to the Headmaster with the news and the Order was able to take quick action. 
 
 Potter had in effect saved Arthur Weasley's life, without even being in the same bloody room. Once he and the Weasleys had been shipped off to headquarters and Umbridge had been dealt with, Albus had sent his Patronus messenger down to their bedroom. Severus in black woolen long-johns and dressing gown, and <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> in her cashmere pajamas and oversized cardigan had appeared in Dumbledore's office pale faced with dark circles under their eyes. 
 
 For the rest of the night they struggled to stay awake, drawing up theories and shooting them down while Albus kept the hot chocolate and tea coming. They could not be sure if the snake had been Voldemort himself in an Animagus form, or if he was remotely manipulating Nagini. Apparently that was something that wonder-boy Potter had not seen in his dream. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had groggily suggested the Imperius curse, but it was a dead end. Animals, especially highly magical animals, were not as easily controlled. Their brains were radically different than humans.
 
 Possession of the snake's body might have been an option, but as <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> was quick to point out, only a disembodied soul could possess something, and it had to be invited too. That bit seemed to pique Albus&rsquo; curiosity and he left <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> and Severus to their bickering as he scooted along his bookshelves on the ladder, scrutinizing titles as he went. There was also the possibility that Voldemort was subverting a spell used by Aurors and Hit Wizard teams who sent in rats bonded to the mind of a controller in order to get an idea of a buildings interior before a strike. Having exhausted the possibilities on the snake issue, they attempted to tackle the question of how the child dreamt the events. 
 
 The only thing they could be sure of at that late hour was that whatever they were dealing with now was absolutely out of the ordinary.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had burst out shouting &ldquo;BUSHMEN!&rdquo; and going on about the divided soul in animals, stubbornly refusing to entertain any other ideas.<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Severus turned on her and they'd had a rather long row about the outdated practices associated with sympathetic magic, and the laws of contagion and contact. Albus took that opportunity to start research, but had to break the fight up when <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> leaned in and snarled that just because something was outdated did not mean it was useless, and furthermore if his brain was as big as his conk (she leaned in and flicked him hard on the nose) he&rsquo;d have figured that out already&hellip;
 
 The watch shifts at the Department of Mysteries had been completely called off; three casualties were too much for even Albus' conscience. Though on the off chance that Voldemort had realized the connection between himself and Potter, Albus had decided to take cautionary measures. He wouldn't say why he couldn't teach Potter Occlumency, he only assigned Severus to the task without entertaining any arguments. 
 
 Severus received a letter he was to give to Black at his leisure, so long as he and Potter were informed before school began. With his potentially peaceful holidays already spoiled by the news, Severus decided to put it off for as long as he could. By the time they made it back to his quarters, it was seven in the morning, only an hour before he had to start lessons. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had taken advantage of his absence from the big bed and holed up there under her feather stuffed blanket, drooling on his favorite pillow. She did look awfully cozy, so much so that Severus had been tempted to shove her out once she'd warmed the bed up so he could have a little nap. 
 
 Payback for the &ldquo;conk&rdquo; bit&hellip;
 
 Instead he'd had the house elves put on coffee and sat down to write to Malfoy about his assignment. He peppered the letter with assurances that Potter would never learn to block his mind, only grudgingly admitting that he had to teach the brat. Severus got a letter at lunch from Malfoy indicating that the Dark Lord had felt a disturbance in his mind and suspected that Albus would be trying to shield the boy. Though, when Severus went to tell Albus, he was gone. 
 
 Glancing at the clock, he groaned inwardly; another fifteen minutes left with these little dullards before he could go reclaim his bed. When he looked up, he caught Granger stealing a glance at him as if she suspected he'd murdered Potter and Weasley just for fun. Cleverest witch of her age indeed; the little twit would jump off a cliff if she read it in a book.
 
 Then there was a shout from Longbottom's table. Well hoo-bloody-ray, it wasn't a Friday unless Longbottom blew something up. 
 
 When Severus saw that the last of the slugs had been peeled off the walls, and that Longbottom felt as frazzled and twitchy as he did, he was finally able to retire to his quarters. Sure enough, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> was still holed up in his bed, wrapped around his favorite pillow (it was the only one that still had a bit of spring to it), with a dreadfully smug grin on her sleeping face. 
 
 Too tired to care anymore, he worked off his boots and flopped onto the bed's free space fully clothed. He was asleep before his head even hit the pillow. 
 
 Midway through the night, he woke up to find <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> twisting herself up in all the blankets like a caterpillar in a cocoon, muttering something that sounded like &quot;the goats.&quot; Groggily, Severus recalled that the primary reason Aberforth had hired <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> was because she was very good with goats (she had been a surly barmaid). If a nanny gave birth to a weak kid, she never hesitated to curl up under a blanket with it to help maintain body temperature; the old fashioned way is best, she'd insisted. 
 
 After a futile battle to try to reclaim some of the blankets, Severus grunted a bit as he watched <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> sleep there; it was a bit hard to make the image of a cold government agent fit with the memory of the goat's nurse. When he slept, he dreamt of the time she carried the weakest kid swaddled against her bare back like an Eskimo baby as she hauled trays of tankards against one sharp hip. 
 
 He woke up right on schedule on Saturday morning to the usual empty expanse of bed. Severus scrounged in the back of his wardrobe for his default Muggle clothes; a black army jumper and woolen trousers, with his hair in a ponytail. Unfortunately the disguise didn't make him feel terribly cunning, just itchier and more like a prat than usual. 
 
 <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> actually looked excited when he found her at the tea table, bent over the Daily Prophet with a truly bizarre assortment of food crammed on a large plate and drenched in rosemary gravy. She'd dressed for the occasion with a gray knitted <st1:place w:st=""on"">Henley</st1:place> shirt over a pair of well worn jeans with heavy military boots. She'd also caked on a layer of makeup that covered her scars rather well, but not her tattoos. Well, at least that accounted for the mess of discarded tins of &quot;Gilderoy Lockhart's Fantabulous Correcting Coverall&quot; in the bathroom. 
 
 &quot;Don't you look cozy,&quot; she snickered. 
 
 Severus growled and sneered in response, feeling like a cat stuffed in doll clothes. Leaning over to spear a sausage off her plate, he took a big bite before brandishing his fork at her. &quot;Let it be noted, Ms Mezarci, that I am giving up a perfectly good Saturday to escort you when I could have simply dumped you on the werewolf. You would be well advised not to irritate <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:state w:st=""on"">me.</st1:state></st1:place>&quot; 
 
 &quot;Oh that would have been oodles of fun. Has Lupin changed much since Hogwarts? Did he ever get a spine or is he still subject to Black's every whim?&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> stifled a yawn and looked expectantly at him. 
 
 &quot;I believe you're familiar with the events of Black's escape. Even when Black was supposed to be a murdering convict, Lupin kept his secrets. Interesting, though; one would have thought that an Evocator would be more understanding of a werewolf.&quot; 
 
 &quot;It has nothing to do with the fact that he's a werewolf, he never pulled his load on prefects duties. Lazy git,&quot; she said absent mindedly as she studied the social column. 
 
 &quot;Where are we off to Ms Mezarci?&quot; he muttered, leaning over to scoop up a forkful of egg. 
 
 &quot;<st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Charleville Forest Castle</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Ireland</st1:country-region></st1:place>, County Offaly. How are we going to get there?&quot; 
 
 &quot;We'll Apparate.&quot; 
 
 &quot;I did a bit of research on the spot; apparently it has the sort of history that makes a lovely breeding ground for Dementors. Druid sacrifice site first, perfect intersection of Ley lines, a plague burial ground, and then someone put a castle on it around the Regency when all those Hell Fire clubs were popping up. Apparently there was a fair bit of Dark Arts activity on the site when the castle was first built and it's been all down hill from there.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Did Lupin's little service sift this one out?&quot; Severus sneered as he tried to stab some bacon onto his fork. Lupin had been posing as a Muggle 'paranormal investigator' on the side to keep an eye on Dementor activity and any possible Dark creatures out of bounds. When Muggles sought help from 'ghost hunters,' requests matching Dementor activity were answered by an Order member with free time and a strong Patronus. The Ministry was not willing to admit that some of their Dementors were out of control. 
 
 &quot;We're answering the call today as agents from the service,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> yawned. 
 
 &quot;Delightful.&quot; 
 
 &quot;And it's almost Winter Solstice, so we're in for some trouble.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Ms Mezarci, I know what to do with a Dementor,&quot; Severus sneered, jabbing his fork in the air at her. 
 
 &quot;That's the problem, I need to see if I can get near them without having to do a soul extraction on myself,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said quickly. 
 
 Severus dropped his fork and stared at her incredulously. &quot;Ms Mezarci, for the sake of security, don't you think it would be wise to go with the method you know best?&quot; 
 
 &quot;If things go the way we expect, and they likely will now that the Dark Lord can't get into the Department of Mysteries, we'll be going to Azkaban, won't we?&quot; 
 
 &quot;Obviously.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Well, if the Dark Lord's got any brains he'll have me taking care of the Dementors, just in case. And let's just say that I don't like taking out my soul if I don't absolutely have to. It's the safest way to get around the Dementors but&hellip;&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> shuddered and shook her head vehemently. 
 
 &quot;I want to see if can stand to be near them long enough to do enough physical damage to disrupt the bodies, maybe incapacitate them.&quot; 
 
 &quot;I can't believe I am obliged to indulge you in doing something so unbelievably stupid,&quot; he muttered, surveying the plate to see if there was anything left worth eating. 
 
 &quot;Try the cheese, it won't kill you,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said, as she slid out of her seat and headed for the bedroom. The cheese did not kill him; in fact it was rather tasty once he scraped the gravy off. His wool trousers, however, were a different story. Severus had to resist the urge to scratch himself in unbecoming places as he rummaged for his beaten-up trilby hat and top coat that once belonged to his father. <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>, with sharply tailored wool overcoat and fur lined military hat, looked as though she were in uniform. As soon as all scarves were tucked neatly inside coats and their gloves were on, they took the usual path out of the castle. 
 
 His sense of direction must have been off that day because Severus mis-Apparated twice before they got anywhere within range of <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:placetype w:st=""on"">County</st1:placetype> <st1:placename w:st=""on"">Offaly</st1:placename></st1:place>. Once they ended up in some poor farmers haystack, and the second time they ended up in the alley behind a pub in Tullamore. When they finally landed in front of a massive oak tree, they knew they were in the right spot. 
 
 Lourdes fished around in her pocket for the scrap of paper Lupin had written the details on while Severus slipped his wand up his sleeve into a quick release holster, just in case. 
 
 &quot;Looks like we need to speak with one of the property owners, says here they're staying in the caretaker's cottage. Which should be right over there,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said, pointing to a very twee building that seemed out of place on grounds that fairly hummed with ancient magic. She donned a pair of mirrored sunglasses to hide her tattoos before rapping smartly on the door. 
 
 It opened just a crack, revealing a sliver of a twenty-something boy, sandy haired and fine-boned with a slightly dazed expression that suggested he&rsquo;d headed one too many footballs in his day.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>His appeal wasn&rsquo;t lost on <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>, who slid her sunglasses down her nose a bit, presumably to better take in the sights. Severus felt his face twist into an annoyed sneer. 
 
 &quot;Hello&hellip;?&quot; The boy surveyed them cautiously before <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> composed herself and gave the boy a tight, rusty smile that did not sit well with the rest of her features. 
 
 &quot;Hello, my name is Lourdes Mezarci, and this is Severus Snape; we're from the Society for Psychical Research. You placed a request for our help?&quot; Her hand shot out and the boy shook it warily. 
 
 &quot;Aye, we did. Please, come on in and I'll change so I can take you up to the castle. I&rsquo;m William, by the way.&quot; William smiled a nervous, glittery smile that made Severus think of a threatened dog, and stepped back to let them into the cozy little living room. The moment he vanished down the hallway, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> relaxed and sank into a wingback chair, tilting her head to look down the hallway after him. 
 
 &ldquo;Nice,&rdquo; she said slyly.
 
 &quot;He's your type is he?&quot; Severus said casually, examining the kitschy figurines gathering dust on the mantle piece. &ldquo;And a double barreled surname.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>How&rsquo;d you like to be a <span style=""font-family: Garamond;"">Hutton Bury?&rdquo;</span>
 
 &quot;Nah, I&rsquo;ve always been partial to meatier specimens. But I've never had time for one,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> replied absent mindedly, turning to examine the family photos on the side table. Her eyes narrowed as she apprised groups of smiling people motionless inside the frames. 
 
 She didn't seem to realize what she'd said- <i style="""">never had time</i> - and in a flash Severus knew. He saw the tiny apartment crammed with cartons of books, papered in crime scene reports, the little refrigerator filled with single serve instant dinners, the wardrobe full of personality-less uniforms. He felt the miserable sticky heat of nights under a bare bulb in regulation under-things on graying sheets with only photos of the dead for company. 
 
 Feeling an ugly little thump somewhere in his chest, he knew what she did not tell him months ago in her confession. Without even having to look her in the eyes, he saw her whole rawboned, dingy, overworked life married to an organization that did not love her the way she loved it. 
 
 Before Severus could figure out whether he wanted to use this new weapon, William reappeared in a puffy coat and deerstalker hat carrying a keychain. Flashing a smile that seemed less threatening now, he led them out into the snow, starting up a wide path flanked by naked oak trees. Lourdes glided along at William's side, fairly purring as they discussing his university degree (Archeology, at Oxford) and the wonders of Hittite culture, while Severus stayed a few steps behind, unable to resist the urge to roll his eyes every time she let out a low, predatory laugh in response to one of his jokes. <span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Though the sky was gray and overcast, the icy mist that hung ominously around the castle and the trees&hellip;
 
 As soon as they got within spitting distance of the castle, William fumbled in his pocket for the keys and handed them off to <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>. &quot;If you don't mind, I'll be heading back to the house. The castle gives me the collywobbles, so I'll leave it t'you professionals. If you need a bit of warming up afterwards, we've got plenty of soup and tea up at the house that you're welcome to, of course.&quot; With one last stupid grin, William was off.
 
 -***-<br style="""" /> <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style="""" /> <!--[endif]--></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Hear that? A bit of warming up, Mr. Snape.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I daresay you ought to wait in the living room.&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> covered her mouth and gave Severus a coy look.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was too easy to take the piss out on him when he&rsquo;d spent the whole walk to the castle grumbling a few steps behind her like a horrible old man.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;But whatever will dear <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Brandon</st1:city></st1:place> think when I have to tell him you prefer meatier fare?&rdquo; he replied, voice thick with sarcastic &ldquo;concern..&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;I expect by the time you can mention it to him, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Brandon</st1:city></st1:place>&hellip;won&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>She fluttered her eyelashes and rolled her eyes before twisting the key and giving the door a good shove and a slam with her hip, admitting them into a dusty gallery with a checkerboard tile floor.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>A vast staircase dominated the room with a grand crystal chandelier hanging cockeyed over top.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><span style="""">&nbsp;</span>The change in the atmosphere was instant; it was dim, despite the windows, and strangely misty. Inside it was even colder than it was out in the snow, a sort of cold that crept through the clothes and under the skin. 
 
 <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> heard them all at once, every voice muttering or sobbing, making threats and pleas to no one in particular. Wraiths, energy left behind by a violent death. She hadn't heard this many of them in one place since she was in prison, and the intensity of it made her sick to her stomach.
 
 <i style="""">Deep breaths, take it easy&hellip; you can do this</i>, she thought, slumping back against a paneled wall for support. 
 
 &quot;How many wraiths?&quot; Severus voice sounded distant in the midst of the noise. 
 
 &quot;Ah&hellip;&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> sucked air through her teeth as a sharp pain shot through her head. &quot;I don't&hellip;I don't know.&quot; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>She struggled to look around and get her bearings.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>There was only one option in terms of navigation and that was to go up the stairs.
 
 &quot;Focus, Ms Mezarci,&quot; he said sharply. Her eyelids twitched and fluttered as she worked to shut down the part that heard the hissing and mutterings until the only sound left was the humming of her blood in her ears. She lurched uneasily up the stairs behind him, drawing deep breaths and counting her own footsteps as they drifted into the largest, brightest room they could find. 
 
 &quot;If you cannot even handle a minor wraith incident, how do you think you're going to survive getting near those Dementors?&quot; Severus said coldly, folding his arms over his chest and staring imperiously down his nose at her once they&rsquo;d reached the entrance of a grand and starkly furnished gallery.
 
 &quot;Fuck off!<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I'm a little out of practice you know,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> shot back savagely, drawing herself up to full height to match him. &quot;Where do you suppose we'll find the breeding activity?&quot; 
 
 &quot;You said there was a Druids' circle here?&quot; he asked, moving to stare out the window into the woods. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>The room was bizarre &ndash; a long gallery with elaborate paneling and ceiling moldings and incongruous disco balls hung here and there.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The whole room was starkly white washed but that did little to brighten the feel of the room.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The whole place had an air of half-repaired and inevitable decay.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Evidently William and his family were short on funds, and the castles current occupants would have made them hard to gather&hellip;
 
 &quot;Yes, but I think it's out in the woods.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Does this castle have a dungeon?&quot; 
 
 &quot;It has a basement, I don't know that you could call it a dungeon,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said, raising an eyebrow as she took a few cautious steps across the gallery towards the end that looked dimmest. &quot;Are you coming?&quot; 
 
 &quot;Right behind you,&quot; Severus said, almost absent mindedly, as he threw one last glance out the window. 
 
 &quot;So, ah, where does one usually put the entrance to a dungeon?&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said, poking her head into the hallway and staring down either end. Strangely enough she was a little apprehensive. Humans she could deal with. Dementors&hellip;well that was what they were here to see about. 
 
 Severus swept past her into the hall and took a moment to size the situation up, eyes darting coolly in either direction before starting down to the left, and <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> followed closely. The fog was definitely thickening in this end of the hallway as they approached a towerside stone staircase with crumbling plastered walls.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was poorly lit and the shadows on the walls flickered and shifted as if they had lives of their own. They seemed to be whispering to one another, the voices sent a tingling shock of fear out from the center of her chest, making the hair on the back of her neck stand on end and tears gather in the corners of her eyes. 
 
 &quot;Do you hear that?&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> muttered, her hand shooting out to grab Severus by the shoulder. He turned and gave her a withering look. 
 
 &quot;I thought you'd decided to focus away from the obvious wraith activity here, Ms Mezarci&hellip;&quot; 
 
 &quot;This is different- look at the walls.&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> drew a little closer to him and pointed to the corner. The natural shadow there warped abruptly and Severus' muscles tensed under her hand, though his face remained passive. The shadows and the weird hoarse whispers threw her so off her guard that the sudden sounds of footsteps, a scramble, and then a horrible thud followed by a child&rsquo;s scream near the staircase nearly made her jump out of her skin.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> felt an involuntary impression of a scene flash through her mind of the ceiling growing distant very quickly&hellip;and then nothing at all.</p>  <span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"">
 &quot;Wraith&hellip;&quot; Severus muttered dismissively. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> was glad to see that for all his blustering his eyes were watering too. 
 
 &quot;Child,&quot; she hissed, looping her arm around his, drawing closer for warmth. 
 
 &quot;Ms Mezarci, you realize you're clinging to my wand arm, don't you?&quot; he muttered with a sneer. 
 
 &quot;We should be approaching this&hellip; professionally. Do you want to take the lead?&quot; she said crisply, dropping his arm and rubbing her hands together. 
 
 &quot;As I've got the wand, I think that's only proper.&quot; 
 
 &quot;Don't get too puffed up about it,&quot; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> muttered, feeling a stab of irritation at his sudden urge to pull rank.
 
 &quot;I'll head up the back.&quot; Severus began a slow survey of the walls and the floor once they&rsquo;d reached the dank basement hall, stopping every once in awhile to tap the toes of his boots against the junction of wall and floor, or rap his knuckles against the wall, looking for any indication of a hidden entrance. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> made regular rotations, keeping a very sharp eye on the shadows which were still shifting along the walls, trying to move when she was not looking at them. It gave her the very bizarre sensation that they were being observed&hellip; 
 
 &quot;Here,&quot; Severus said suddenly. &quot;These Muggle architects are artless, you can see the hinges.&quot; 
 
 As he searched for the device to open the door, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> heard the hoarse whispers snickering and hissing as if they were very pleased. She grabbed Severus urgently by the shoulder and looked him straight in the eye. <i style="""">We're being watched</i>, she thought firmly. 
 
 Severus nodded to signify that he understood and flicked his wrist, causing his wand to slide easily into his hand. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> reached down and hiked up the leg of her jeans to get to the heavy phurba knife she had holstered there. It was a far cry from the little ice pick of a dagger she usually chose. The phurba was stout with a three sided blade like a tent stake; it did a brutally efficient amount of damage. If there was anything to damage, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> thought grimly. 
 
 The wall clicked, and swung open just a little bit. The voices grew louder, and the air grew colder, but it was no worse than being hit by a chilly current in an already cold lake. Severus had the tip of his wand lit up, but she could not see any further than the length of his arm. 
 
 &quot;This would be the spot,&quot; he said. Looking down into the miasma of the basement, the darkness seemed almost hungry. As if the moment they crossed the threshold, the door might slam shut and the house would devour them whole. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Her body pulsed with a ripple of ice cold pinpricks just under her skin.
 
 &quot;They're young, still hungry,&quot; Severus murmured, as if he could read her mind. &quot;They don't really know what to do&hellip;yet&quot; 
 
 &quot;It's bizarre. I don't feel any life at all.&quot; She was a little tired of waiting, and stretched her neck back and forth to ease the tension in her upper body. &quot;Can you conjure up a torch or something for me?&quot; 
 
 Severus complied by tracing a long shape in the air. A moment later a heavy iron torch, like the ones that could be found in the older parts of Hogwarts, hung in the air. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> reached out to catch it and raised an eyebrow at him. 
 
 &quot;This wasn't quite what I meant but&hellip;well never mind.&quot; Taking a deep breath to steel herself, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> started creeping down the half rotted wooden stairs. The dark air seemed too dense to be just a fog, and the torch acted like an umbrella in a rain storm, creating a lone patch of light in the thick darkness. <br style="""" /> <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style="""" /> <!--[endif]--></span>"

He only heard the sound briefly, the low droning grind of a chant vanished into eerie silence when the chalk lines on the floor began to glow pale, icy green. Severus fired off a shade charm for the windows as quickly as he could to keep the light in, and sealed off the cracks at the top and bottom of the door for safety&rsquo;s sake. <br /> <br /> She made a triangle out of her index fingers and thumbs, using it like a target sight to zero in on the circles and lines she'd drawn earlier, which now blazed sharp white against the glow of the mirror glass. The mirror's surface began to bubble and warp alarmingly as a misty sort of light seeped out and congealed into a little shape between her fingers. <br /> <br /> A butterfly or possibly a moth, made of silvery light, beat its wings wildly in place, trapped in the section of the ward she'd designated for it. When she&rsquo;d coaxed the first six out of the mirror, the very last one to emerge looked tatty and rather black in spots. Mouth still moving at a rapid pace, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> reached out and trapped them in her fist one by one. Clutching the light close to her heart, rocking back and forth, she unfolded her hands and let it spiral off into the air where it vanished with a pop. <br /> <br /> The only one left was the little blighted one that belonged to Quirrell; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had to spend three times as long on him. It hovered in the air between her hands, breaking apart and re-congealing, until something went awry. The darker parts that she&rsquo;d been trying to sift out began to swirl around on their own. They took on a serpentine form, and darting around her head as <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>&rsquo; eyes widened with shock. <br /> <br /> For just a moment, Severus panicked too; the situation looked astoundingly familiar. The last time she&rsquo;d looked like that, she&rsquo;d left the Hog&rsquo;s Head on a stretcher, bleeding heavily from her chest. Severus leapt to his feet, but ran face first into the barrier formed by her magic. <br /> <br /> <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> was trapped inside the boundaries, groping on her lap for the chalk, she bared her teeth at the <i style="""">thing</i> and snarled something at it.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Pushing it back with the force of her magic emanating darkly from her hand, <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> scrawled a new design on the floor. Biting down violently on her lip, she swiped the resulting blood into a cross-in-circle pattern in the center of the new ward. The black thing was fighting her, blooming apart and trying to wind around her neck, or slither in through her mouth, its ghost tongue flicking at her ears as if it wanted to entice her. Her face contorted into a snarl, she inhaled and the thing was pulled toward her, snared between her hands where her magic was arrayed in shadowy lines as though she were playing cats cradle.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Forcing it into the boundary of the thing she&rsquo;d drawn on the floor, <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> rose, and stomped three times, shoving a bronze mirror snatched from her ornament belt at the little black thing. As soon as it was confronted with its reflection, it began to loose its shape, twisting in the air before it folded into itself and vanished. In an instant the chalk circles stopped glowing and the room was pitch-black again.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Quirrell&rsquo;s soul had escaped, fluttering wildly around the darkened room towards the bluebell flame on the table - the lone source of light now, before Severus heard the click of a ghau opening Quirrell was sucked away in a bright streak. <br /> <br /> Severus counter charmed the windows to let moonlight spill across the floor, and saw that <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had been blown clear across the room into the loom. Slightly cross-eyed and covered in sweat, she was clutching the mirror as if her life depended on it. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Severus asked numbly, though he could feel some of the blood returning to his face as he stared at her. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me he stole life from a Unicorn?&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> sputtered as she mopped the sweat off her forehead. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Pardon me, Ms Mezarci, you are the Evocator, not me. I had no idea such information was relevant,&rdquo; he hissed, straightening up. Severus felt relief that she wasn&rsquo;t dead wash over him first, followed quickly by anger that she would make such presumptions. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Dorje, that knocked me proper,&quot; she muttered, patting the back of her head as if to check for cracks. &quot;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like that, I should have put two and two together&hellip;the Dark Lord possessed this Quirrell, right?&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I would have assumed you knew that the presence of two souls attempting to live off one life shortens the original occupant&rsquo;s life span. We lost four unicorns that year. Did you have the opportunity to figure out what was attacking you?&rdquo; Severus slid back into his chair and snatched up the quill, poised to take notes again. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I was a bit busy in case you didn&rsquo;t notice,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> muttered. &ldquo;And that was&hellip;<i style="""">someone</i> attacking me, not something. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Could you conjure me a bucket of water and a rag please? And if you could move this thing back against the wall.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> As soon as the mirror was cleared, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> scrubbed at the chalk and blood until there was no evidence save for the drying water stain on the smooth stone. She stood up, dusting off her skirts before she seated herself across the table and laid her head down on her arms. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Do you need something to drink?&rdquo; he muttered, looking out the window. The moon had traveled quite a distance across the sky since they&rsquo;d arrived in the room; it must be very late now. She nodded weakly in reply. With a flick of his wrist Severus managed to scrounge up a pot of jasmine infused tea and some of the leftover miniature fruit tarts from that evening&rsquo;s supper. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Why did you choose butterflies?&rdquo; he asked coolly, popping a tart topped with a few blueberries into his mouth. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;They&rsquo;re moths, you can tell by the thick bodies. I remember them because they always flock to light. When we stayed in the forest in <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Bulgaria</st1:place></st1:country-region>, Everdika would hurry in to collect them after I finished a spell. I thought they were interesting.&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> smiled softly as she selected a strawberry tart. <br /> <br /> &quot;You knew Everdika?&quot; Snape asked cautiously.<br /> <br /> &quot;I did. She's the one who taught me to spoil and read aether when I was in school. I went to see her during the summers for a month or two before Mama and Papa would take me back home, and I saw her a lot when I was working in <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Turkey</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>I was sorry to hear she decided to die, but it would have been her choice.&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> nodded. &ldquo;This tea is really good by the way&hellip;smells like flowers.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Jasmine tea, the house-elves don&rsquo;t usually make it,&rdquo; he grunted. Picking up his quill again, Severus ran over the information he&rsquo;d got down on parchment. &ldquo;I must admit, Ms Mezarci, I was quite sure you were going to receive another gaping chest wound for a few moments there. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>What did you say to it?&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;I told it that it had no idea what it was dealing with&hellip;&rdquo;<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> said ominously.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Mind telling me the difference between this and what you did to me&hellip;?&rdquo; He raised an eyebrow at her sharply, she had some of his life and he had no intention on letting her get away with it.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Umm, well, best to begin at the beginning on that one,&quot; she said thoughtfully. &quot;There are two kinds of things capable of self generated action; beings and non-beings, as opposed to things that are simply matter like&hellip;rocks and planets and stars.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>There are four markers of a sentient <i style="""">being,</i> as opposed to non-being; life, the force that keeps the body and soul together, soul, the essence of the individual, and the corporeal vessel, a body.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><span style="""">&nbsp;</span>The fourth factor is that beings have a collective conscientia, a reservoir of the experience, time, and history of a species that a spirit or entity has no access to unless it's bestowed through a being with a soul. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Non-beings are <i style="""">anomie</i> - without law or soul, outside the realm of concientia which leaves them with little concept of things like time, natural law or empathy.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Like beings they still leave their mark on the <i style="""">aether</i> &ndash; the very impressionable and changeable transmission medium, so to speak &ndash; the thing on which all activity, all magic, all thought is impressed.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Beings are far less fluid by nature than a nonbeing like a daemon or an elemental that only knows what it can gather from ever changing aether.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;However being is pretty perilous because beings are mutable in some forms, that is to say a being can <i style="""">die. </i><span style="""">&nbsp;</span>And when I say die, I mean that the soul has to separate from its other elements, and once it&rsquo;s out of a body its of little use.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>If you run out of life or snuff it out by destroying the body, you separate the soul and produce the state of common death, which so easy it can happen by accident. And what I took from you was life, but I didn&rsquo;t need to damage your body to shake it loose.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Some types of life can be easily taken by anyone but the cost is high, take unicorn blood for instance. Hags retain and Vampires develop a primitive but potent ability to steal life via blood or flesh, but at the cost of - well you've met them.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I can&rsquo;t tell you why Evocator&rsquo;s magic is the way it is, other than that it&rsquo;s known to be very primitive and low frequency. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><i style="""">Basal</i> you might say, and very specialized which is limiting, but also affords some advantage.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Because we are the way we are, I can use the magic to touch and manipulate things on my frequency with relative ease, and one of those things is the soul-in-tact. We can use the magic to read patterns in the concientia and aether, to find and open a gateway to banish souls to, for lack of a better word, a crossroad.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>That&rsquo;s the way these souls would have gone if they&rsquo;d had a common death with no complications like that mirror, and chosen to move forward.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;What about the mirror is a complication?&rdquo; Severus asked, genuinely curious about this aspect.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Obviously Erised was a powerful object created with very old magic, unlikely to be recreated now.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>But Severus could not imagine why it held sway over souls&hellip;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;The mirrors is very old, older than the frame.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s not actually a silvered glass, it&rsquo;s backed by physically manifested magic, the only thing like it I&rsquo;ve ever seen&hellip;and I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of antiques,&rdquo; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> said breathlessly, casting an admiring glance at the mirror.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Incredible magic to perform, and that instant must have been when the magic was trapped in the glass.<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think it must have been done in <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Venice</st1:city></st1:place> because it&rsquo;s so flawless.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The way it&rsquo;s been enchanted actually forms a little pocket in the aether the mirror is made of and occupies, so the mirror can exist as stably as we see it now &ndash; un-temperamental and unfailing.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>But that little pocket can trap things. The mirror&rsquo;s magic is designed to read the soul and concientia of an individual and construct a scenario that reflects what it sees, and that has a greater pull on a soul enraptured by it than a natural gateway.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I don&rsquo;t think many things like this could exist, and not nearly as perfectly as this one.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Now, as for you, I ah&hellip;have about two weeks that belong to you. Do you want them back?&rdquo; she asked softly. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Severus sneered at her and shook his head. What a stupid question, who wouldn&rsquo;t want it back? <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> scooted her chair around the table so she was almost knee to knee with him, and motioned him forward with a flick of her finger. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Open your mouth a little,&rdquo; she instructed. &ldquo;As soon as you feel it, take a deep breath&hellip;&rdquo; Severus watched her close her eyes as she muttered under her breath again. Then there was the soft sound of her exhaling, and her breath clouded in the air as it would on a cold day. Filling his lungs fit to burst, he watched the little cloud being pulled into his body and felt a sensation of tingling warmth spread through his chest, all the way up to the roots of his hair and the soles of his feet. <br /> <br /> As she hung suspended in concentration, Severus had a split second to examine her mouth, hovering about an inch away from making contact with his. It was an inviting, plump shape despite the ragged state of her lower lip and he was unsure if it was the distance or the renewed jolt of life in his body that made him wonder dizzily what might happen if he leaned forward just enough to touch her mouth with his. Would the lips pull back to reveal destructive teeth, or would the contact would be as soft and light as the brushing of moth wings&hellip; <br /> <br /> Severus did not find out; when their eyes met, a flash of virulent green replacing the mental image of softness and warm breath, they both withdrew quickly. Something about that strange tension opened up an old wound inside of him, leaving him almost hungry- if that was even the word for it. The tarts did nothing for it, but he managed to grind the feeling down to a dull ache as they ate in silence for a few moments. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Will you at least tell me how many people you think you killed?&rdquo; she asked, tilting her head and resting it against her fist. &ldquo;I gave you that courtesy.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;No one, directly.&rdquo; He had to pause for a moment and forced down a mouthful of tea. There was the familiar heavy feeling of sick guilt and weakness weighing on his whole body, almost choking him at the throat. <br /> <br /> Drawing another deep breath, he forced himself to continue &ldquo;I continued my attempts to modify and experiment with hexes and curses, the way I did in school. But I never stood before someone to snuff their life out. The Dark Lord does not hesitate to capitalize on the different personalities of his Death Eaters. As long as we felt we were in control of how we were being used, he was perfectly happy to let us go on believing it.&rdquo; Severus looked up at <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> who seemed to be processing all of this very carefully. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; she said, leaning in and peering into his eyes. He saw that hungry spark in her face again, but it was different from the predator he&rsquo;d seen a few days ago. No, this was more like the look she&rsquo;d had the first time she managed to break through into his memories. <i style="""">I want to know everything, I want to see where you came from</i>, she had insisted. <br /> <br /> Severus found himself tensing up involuntarily, his eyes closing to block her out. There were so many things no one else should ever see or know about, lingering in the back of his mind, recalled more often in these past five years than before. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I do not think you need to know any more,&rdquo; he hissed, tilting his chin towards his chest so his hair swung forward to hide his face. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;You know, that&rsquo;s the danger in telling people you went to university to study psychology. They clam up because they always think you&rsquo;re psychoanalyzing them. I promise I won&rsquo;t ask you anything about your mother,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said wryly. Severus looked up for just a fraction of a second and raised an eyebrow inquisitively.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Sorry, Freud humor.&rdquo; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> smirked awkwardly and extended a hand towards his. She touched his fingers tentatively a few times before letting it settle into place. Severus threw up the hardest, most unconcerned fa&ccedil;ade he could muster while he tried to figure out what this meant. He was not often touched, as if people were afraid that his skin was poisonous, so he&rsquo;d come to regard any contact with a great deal of suspicion. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, though, he wasn&rsquo;t eager to pull away. Severus felt his stomach squirm uncomfortably and he looked off to one side, feigning disinterest. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;It has been a long time, Ms Mezarci. I hardly remember anything.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a Dark Mark too, you know,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said pointedly.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Do not imagine that yours and mine are the same,&rdquo; Severus said, narrowing his eyes and curling his lip up. There was a sour tension taking over in the back of his throat, the same feeling he got when Black interrupted him at meetings to throw out some ridiculously uninformed proposition. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Enlighten me,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said, fingers sliding away as she leaned back in her chair and cradled her teacup between her hands, raising an eyebrow inquisitively. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;You are as presumptuous as Black,&rdquo; he growled, watching as <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> frowned at the comparison. &ldquo;With the benefit of an introduction, and years of information and research, you knew beforehand what you were getting yourself into, Ms Mezarci. I had no real idea of the breadth and depth of the organization I was aligning myself with.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> pursed her lips, the image of this stuck and batted about Severus' brain a little longer than was natural.<br /> <br /> Severus snapped his eyes closed again and breathed, trying to clear everything that wasn't necessary out of his muddled brain. &ldquo;The Dark Lord could afford to take his time then, not just anyone could receive the mark. If you were a person of interest you were approached by a Death Eater who had the most likely connection to you. In my case it was Lucius Malfoy because of our early associations at Hogwarts. There were different methods, of course, for each individual. You did not refuse an invitation without consequence, and I had no desire to die.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> shifted languidly in her chair before she took another long drink from her teacup. &ldquo;And you were interested&hellip;&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I was much less discreet about my ambitions then, and about my interest in the darker arts. That was the approach they used: the promise of unbridled study, again. The Dark Lord, I was told, was generously willing to overlook my blood status. I was able to parade my various school successes before Malfoy, the jinxes I had invented and my potions book corrections. I thought surely that I was a natural, too clever for them not to take. There was the prospect of belonging, Ms Mezarci, which I doubt you have ever had to ponder.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> Severus felt another deep stab of self loathing, and fought the urge to glare at her with the hatred and envy bubbling up inside. He&rsquo;d been deeply jealous from the first moment he saw the other memories of her as a tall, skinny child, laughing and grinning with her pet camel and all her adoring aunties and uncles. <br /> <br /> <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> winced when he said it, as if he&rsquo;d just torn off a bandage to display a gruesome wound. &ldquo;Schoolboys whose only accomplishments are petty cruelties have no idea what lies in store for them when they enter into the Dark Lord&rsquo;s service. I completed my inaugural tasks, which amounted to secretive errand running, and faced the Dark Lord to receive my precious mark. I belonged, though I quickly discovered the Death Eaters had only social connections and competition. It was a much faster game than I was accustomed to playing. I imagined, though, that I could be the worst out of all of them and therefore the best. Once I had been marked, I agreed to anything to grasp at that power.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I know the feeling,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said softly. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Magic, we were told, was for the calculating, thinking mind that would probe its darkest depths, stretch, and transform it. I agreed, of course; however, it seemed the Dark Lord and I differed on the subject of usefulness. But when he was strong, when you heard the Dark Lord speak to you personally, praise you, elevate you for those few brief moments in front of everyone else, it seemed like bliss at first. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;The lights go out very quickly, Ms Mezarci, when you start to live every day in constant fear of a misplaced whisper or the slightest mistake. When your work and what you consider brilliance and innovation is brushed aside for base petty cruelty and artless murder. It is hard for me to say for certain when I began to realize I made a mistake, but there was no blow more devastating than the one I received when I realized that my life was not what I thought it would be. None of the things I had anticipated as pleasing or rewarding were enjoyable; I was but a servant to the whims of everyone that ranked higher than myself. I was losing, Ms Mezarci, and I did not want to lose.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> Severus chose his words extremely carefully; he was trying to weave them around the subject he never spoke of. ..<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has his desire or, having it, is satisfied? Thackeray, you know.&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> nodded wisely. &ldquo;Learned that the hard way.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> Severus jerked back, a bit shocked and raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Did Albus tell you that?&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;In my first letter from him coming out of prison, along with a long lecture on the perils of ambition without conscience,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Of course he had no clue what he was talking about.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> &ldquo;That&hellip;was what he told me a long time ago.&rdquo; Severus almost laughed. The thought of Albus recycling the same speech made him wonder if all wayward Slytherins heard it. &ldquo;When all the lights go out, you find yourself running scared towards the only one left on, don&rsquo;t you? Like those moths you are so fond of.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Nobody left any on for me, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;There was one on for me here, as you know. It was not easy; I had to go to Albus. He was the only person who could ever realistically assist someone in leaving the Dark Lord. Albus is neither complacent, nor stupid. Over time, I was forced to confront the hypocrisy, the illogical nature of the arguments and ideals I followed in the most visceral ways Albus could dream up. It would be a great blow to the pride of anyone, I think, to discover the few things I actually valued- knowledge, ingenuity, and work as an extension of my ambition- meant nothing.&rdquo; Severus finished, and silence hung between them as <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> gnawed on her lip thoughtfully. <br /> <br /> For just a moment he felt strangely light, and indulged himself by closing his eyes to savor it. When he heard her voice he came right back down to earth. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;When I was working, it was very easy to justify killing. I told myself that I was an enforcer of the law. They broke it, they deserved to die. I imagine it must have been easy for you then, to justify joining them.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> Severus only grunted a bit in response. It had been incredibly easy to rationalize it then, but it was almost impossible to do it now. What was done, was done, he determined. It couldn&rsquo;t be taken back; the only thing he could do was attempt to work against it, and hope that would be enough for the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;It was strange for me, when they took me to prison and branded me, because I know those people didn&rsquo;t see me as human. I asked myself if I could forgive those people, and I still don&rsquo;t know if I can honestly say yes. Then I had to think, in all that time when I was chained up, if the people who cared about the ones I killed could forgive me. Even if their loved ones did despicable, vicious, horrible things, they might still love them despite all of it, so then what right did I have to take their lives? I had to wonder if repenting and feeling sorry about it meant that I had to wash away everything I did during my career, even the good and helpful parts. It baffles me,&rdquo; she was chewing on her lip again, squinting into her tea dregs as if they could give her the answer. <br /> <br /> Severus was, for a moment, speechless. One particular part of what she&rsquo;d said - <i style="""">even if their loved ones did despicable, vicious, horrible things, they might still love them despite all of it </i>- cut straight through him. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>And it hurt so much that he had to wonder if she planned it &ndash; if she knew about Lily. Right now he didn&rsquo;t have enough patience to worry about what she meant; it was uncomfortable. &ldquo;Forgive me for being direct, Ms Mezarci, but what exactly is it that you are trying to say?&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;What I am trying to say, Mister Snape, is that I am in no position to judge you. I am saying that as far as I can tell we will never really be able to know for sure if we can be forgiven, or redeemed; we can only say what we believe. Who decides if your spying makes up for what you did with the Death Eaters, or if my time in jail and all this now makes up for mine? I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t say. I am saying I&rsquo;m sorry, for going after you like I did,&rdquo; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> said primly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> &ldquo;I broke a promise to you, do you remember?&rdquo; Severus asked suddenly. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I am&hellip;sorry,&rdquo; he said haltingly, taking another deep breath to force the next bit out all in one go. &ldquo;It will not happen again.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Thank you, it means a lot to <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:state w:st=""on"">me.</st1:state></st1:place>&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She gave him a small, tired smile as she picked up her teacup and they finished eating in silence. <br /> <br /> Severus felt as though something had lifted suddenly, perhaps it was because that persistent feeling of apprehension and stomach churning anxiety had finally lifted. All was forgiven&hellip; <br /> <br /> With Lourdes, at least.<br /> <br /> -***- <br style="""" /> <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style="""" /> <!--[endif]--></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">In a fit of what passed for whimsy with Severus, she was transfigured into a fat little moth instead of undergoing disillusionment, allowing her to hide on his neck under his hair, it was a bizarre experience. She&rsquo;d never been an insect before. <br /> <br /> When her body resumed a human shape again, she was not inside the Head of House&rsquo;s quarters, but in some sort of private staging area with cool tiled walls and a fancy iron gate at the other end. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Albus thinks you would benefit from exercise.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Are you saying I&rsquo;m fat?&rdquo; she teased, raising an eyebrow and crossing her arms across her chest. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;You were the one who complained about putting on weight, were you not?&rdquo;<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know how you don&rsquo;t weigh a thousand pounds with the sort of food they feed you here.&rdquo; Severus started down the tiled hallway and tapped his wand on the gate&rsquo;s lock, leading <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> into a room she had no idea Hogwarts housed - a swimming pool, of all things, illuminated by the phosphorescent lights under the water. They cast an eerie blue-green light up onto the walls and the high ceilings supported by large filigree iron arches. Every surface seemed to be covered in shimmery gray-glazed tiles, with the pool lanes marked in deep green. The air smelled strongly antiseptic, making the whole room feel a bit more clinical than it ought to. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Who put this in?&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> gasped, tip-toeing to the edge of the pool where Severus was dipping a sample cup into the water, testing to see if the balance of purification potions was correct. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I am told Phineas Nigellus Black had this installed when he became Headmaster; apparently there was a bit of an uproar about the cost of it, and the integrity of the building. They built it back when &lsquo;regular bathing&rsquo; was being touted as a means to improve health and magical vitality. It&rsquo;s been entrusted to me though, as Head of Phineas&rsquo; former house. No well bred Slytherin would deign to use the lake.&rdquo; Severus dipped a little strip of treated parchment into the sample cup and deemed the blue color it turned acceptable. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I see the position has its benefits. So this is how you keep from turning into a great big pudding. Makes you wonder if Slughorn knew about it,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> snorted. <br /> <br /> The pool turned out to be their release valve; it kept the air clear between them. It was understood now that the need-to-knows were out of the way, and their behavior now was never anything less than proper and befitting. Three times a week without fail, at eleven in the evening, they went to swim. They began at opposite ends, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> in her sensible black suit, Severus in trunks he must have had since his twenties and absurdly enough, a bathing cap. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was trying to protect his hair from the pool&hellip;or vice versa. <br /> <br /> Severus swam as if he were clockwork, each stroke perfectly and efficiently timed with the rest of his body, every motion crisp and perfect. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> went at a languid pace between hard laps, lazily and twirling under water like a child before popping up for a quick breath. She wanted to stay under the surface and enjoy the beautiful, weightless feeling. <br /> <br /> It was almost purifying to reduce everything in the world down to water and a moving body. There was no Dark Lord, no Order under the surface. Those thoughts, those entities could not penetrate the little world of the pool the way her body could the moment she broke the surface and felt the coolness of water envelop her skin. While the Order and the Dark Lord waited on the edge of the pool, there was still the matter of the other body in the water with her. <br /> <br /> Things were amiable now they had settled in to being efficient room mates on their own mundane schedules. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had nearly put the house-elves out of business in her efforts to keep busy during the day, cleaning and scrubbing potions equipment, flicking flies into the spider webs, attacking mounting piles of paper work for other Order members. Severus would occasionally portion off first and second year essays for her to grade if she fidgeted or complained about boredom. <br /> <br /> They listened to the call-in shows about political policy on the WWN, or hours of Liszt, Mahler, and Gesualdo lightened every once in awhile by an hour of Argentine tango. How odd, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> thought as she bobbed up and down, treading water in the deep end; the nature of her situation and how much he had changed since school hit her with the force of a tidal wave.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><br /> Eighteen years would change the nature of anything wouldn&rsquo;t it? There was a sense of separation between the two of them that was far wider than the tea table. In school they had been close in their way; secretly, of course.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Neither of them would have publicly admitted that they were so inelegant as to be close to someone, or that their ideas and improvements came from collusion. After all in one way or another they both longed to be seen as solitary geniuses. <br style="""" /> <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style="""" /> <!--[endif]--></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">It was the side effect of all the mental invasions, glimpsed memories, and shared knowledge. But it was a sort of comrade closeness that never strayed into the realm of cozy friendship, and he never looked at her with the same greedy intensity that he aimed at Evans. The one thing she appreciated above all else was that Severus only saw her as Mezarci &ndash; aloof and smug at times, clever, weird, determined, exasperating on occasion, and often downright infuriating.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>But even during their worst rows she was never simply &ldquo;the Evocator.&rdquo;<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><br /> <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">All that had changed apparently. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> knew where he stood now, when he was younger he was ambitious little star in the pressure cooker with all the other children at Hogwarts.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Time, and his own gravity had exiled him to an empty quarter where he moldered half-dead like a pulsar star on the edge of a very vast galaxy.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>She knew how deep the roots of that went, she&rsquo;d seen him suffer a terminal change when he was in school, the aftershock of which caused ripples of change in her as well.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It removed the last cautious barrier between <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>, Severus, and a great deal of undiscovered emotional and magical territory.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><br /> Things came to a head at the end of fifth year he turned - he&rsquo;d fallen out with Lily Evans and they&rsquo;d doubled their study sessions now that he wasn&rsquo;t trying to keep company with three separate parties. His inhibitions seemed to lower almost instantly and his sense of competition and interest in things that he&rsquo;d been wary of before was much, much higher.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> encouraged these new ventures because of the benefits she reaped, <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>But and sat across from him in the broom cupboards and abandoned classrooms after the <i style="""">Mudblood incident</i> <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>he began to reveal a streak of intense, obsessive mania.<br /> <br /> Lily was unreasonable, Severus would rave, even months and months after it had happened, it was just a word!

They&rsquo;d</i> been friends for ages, if it weren&rsquo;t for Severus she wouldn&rsquo;t have known anything when she came to Hogwarts!</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><br /> <i style="""">And if it wasn&rsquo;t for me, </i><st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had though traitorously, <i style="""">you&rsquo;d have been dangling pants-less in front of the whole of fifth year</i>! <br /> <br /> Lily obviously fancied James Potter, Severus would hiss later, despite Lily&rsquo;s constant objections that Potter was a bullying toe rag.

Before she might have had better access, she might have easily extracted the whole truth if she had been patient.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Instead his confession was a performance, eloquently delivered. There was still the curiously unresolved factor of Lily Evans, and <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> could not quite see where that fit, she didn&rsquo;t know enough.

Vanitas Vanitatum! which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied?&quot; W.M. Thackeray, Vanity Fair<o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p align=""center"" style=""text-align: center;"" class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Albus was just about to add the chocolate to the warm mixture of cream, vanilla, and cinnamon when there was a knock on his office door. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; he said pleasantly, dropping a considerable quantity of Honeyduke&rsquo;s Ykchaua Special Chocolate into the cauldron.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Sir, a word with you please?&rdquo; It was Severus, which was rather fortunate actually. Albus needed to have a word with him about those smashed up desks in the spare classroom.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Excellent timing Severus, I&rsquo;m just about to finish some hot chocolate. May I offer you some? It&rsquo;s a new recipe Aberforth passed along to me, though I daresay I&rsquo;ve had to make some minor modifications to the ingredients. I find too much essence of chili keeps me up all evening.&rdquo; Giving the thick creamy mixture a good stir, Albus looked over his shoulder at Severus.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; he replied, still standing at full attention in front of the large desk.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Ah! Where are my manners, please have a seat. We&rsquo;ll be drinking chocolate shortly, but in the meantime let me take just a moment to ask you to please refrain from destroying any more desks. Argus nearly had kittens when he found your wreckage. If you are looking for something in the way of stress relief, and I understand we need this now more than ever, might I suggest taking up a hobby?&rdquo; Severus did not reply or make a sound; he must have come to discuss something a bit more serious than students or requests for further security for his office.<br /> <br /> Carefully ladling a bit of hot chili infusion into the bottoms of two mugs, Albus added honey and the warm chocolate mixture from the cauldron. Two wand taps later he presented a mug of perfectly frothy chocolate to the morose looking man. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Cortez the explorer once reported to his king that chocolate was the divine drink. I quite agree. Now, Severus, tell me what&rsquo;s on your mind.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> Severus stared down intently at the chocolate as he began to speak. &ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m afraid that Ms Mezarci and I have had a&hellip; disagreement.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> Albus&rsquo; gaze quickly turned penetrating and Severus seemed to feel it, and winced as if burned.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Severus, you are aware of course that having a disagreement of a serious nature with <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> would be most inadvisable? And that your personal safety might very well depend on a small reformation of your interpersonal skills? This is not an issue we can afford to take lightly. If you present Voldemort with even the smallest opportunity to split <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> off, he will take it,&rdquo; Albus said, a little more sharply than he&rsquo;d intended. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I intend to correct this. It&rsquo;s making amends that&rsquo;s become a problem, sir.&rdquo; Severus began recounting the events of the past few days from the details of her disconcerting interrogation to the very panicked incident in which he pulled a wand on her in a frenzy, and <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> evidently stole a little life from him. Right now, he reported, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> was asleep, and she&rsquo;d been that way for about two days.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;I daresay civilized confrontation, or for that matter conversation, may be a bit of a problem for <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>,&rdquo; Albus said thoughtfully. &ldquo;She seems to be well learned in the theories of social interaction but with little interest in applying them outside of her discipline. Once the two of you have found a way to mesh your respective experience, I think you will be just fine.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pardon me for saying so sir, but just fine is hardly safe.&rdquo; Severus looked as though he was struggling to remain composed, and there was a familiar angry edge in his voice. He was always extraordinarily irritable if he thought he was not being trusted.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Severus,&rdquo; Albus said forcefully, compelling the younger man to look at him. &ldquo;I have not placed her next to you because I find you wanting in skill or honesty. But all our lives are in grave danger, and there is the very real possibility that I may not last through this war.&rdquo; Severus looked very briefly shocked by that revelation and nodded solemnly.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Sun Tzu, who has written a treatise on war I find most enlightening, informs us that one can never have too many spies. I took pains to select a second spy I knew you got along with well enough to learn a difficult, restricted magical art on your own. Trust me when I say I needn&rsquo;t have gone out of my way to fetch <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>; there were many eager volunteers to assist here already. Andromeda Tonks offered to leave her husband and family and insert herself alongside her sisters, and her daughter Nymphadora has offered to leave her job and assume any disguise. Remus Lupin has offered to align himself with the creature that bit him.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> Try as he might to control it, Albus could feel some of the strain and some of his frustration leaking into his speech. Frustration over innocent Podmore in Azkaban because of his orders, Fudge&rsquo;s willfull ignorance, Broderick Bode in the Permanent Spell Damage Ward, and Dolores Umbridge upending the normally smooth running of the school. The frustration ate at him while he ought to be sleeping, and the anger at himself lapped hot up the back of his throat whenever he read the paper or looked at Dolores down the Staff Table. It made negotiating peace talks between two fully grown, competent adults absolutely unacceptable.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;That night I asked you to return, you could have said no and I would have understood. It is because I respect you that I am trying to arm you in any way I can. Severus, I know you are not accustomed to depending on, or working with other people. But occasionally it <i style="""">is</i> necessary. Though, from what you&rsquo;ve told me thus far, it seems the two of you have done an excellent job, and Voldemort suspects nothing.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> He watched Severus twitch and fidget for a moment, every few seconds he would shift his weight from one side to the other. &ldquo;Have you told her anything about what I did?&rdquo; Severus blurted, his long hand shooting up to span his forehead like a vice as he massaged his temples. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;In the interest of fairness, Severus, I gave her the same advice my brother gave you- that she ought to go straight to the source,&rdquo; Albus said, feeling a bit calmer after a few sips of chocolate.<br /> <br /> Severus looked concerned and vaguely calculating as he digested that. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; how she worked it out.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> &ldquo;You understand that logical analysis of human behavior used to be her livelihood? I daresay she neglected every other aspect of her life to excel in that area, so I do hope she&rsquo;s quite good at what she does,&rdquo; he said frankly. There was no need to mince words with Severus on that subject; it seemed he&rsquo;d received the worst of what she could dish out. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Sir, I called her a lich, among other things&rdquo; Severus admitted, as contrarily as if he were being forced to confess to hexing a classmate in the hall. <br /> <br /> Albus took a deep drink of hot chocolate to hide his frown. If there wasn&rsquo;t so much riding on the two of them being civil to one another, it might have been amusing (in a grim sort of way) to see Severus subjected to the same unapologetic nastiness that he inflicted on students. While Albus had no desire to treat either of them like students, but they were acting less like adults and more like spoiled teenagers. That was something he hadn't anticipated.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Severus, I am more than willing to acknowledge that there are some wounds too old and too deep to heal completely. But, do you recall another instance in which your use of a word caused you, and another you cared for great pain?&rdquo; Albus paused, and watched Severus for a moment. For scarcely a second an expression of white hot rage flashed over Severus&rsquo; features. Not an unusual response when this topic was broached.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t listen to reason,&rdquo; Severus hissed, twitching in his seat uneasily. &ldquo;It was only a word&hellip;&rdquo;<br /> <br /> &ldquo;To you, perhaps. You knew the damage it would do when you used it, I daresay you intended to hurt her as badly as you were.&rdquo; Albus breathed deeply, preparing to remain calm no matter what would happen next....<br /> <br /> &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t let me make it RIGHT,&rdquo; Severus spat as he dug both of his hands into his scalp. <br /> <br /> There was a moment of stillness, suddenly, and Severus sat almost paralyzed by his own anger, only his chest moved irregularly as he struggled to breathe. That anger and desperate expectation had been accumulating in him for so long, like thick black bile. Albus watched it in his progress over the years, slowly poisoning Severus, turning him bitter. He must have been starving in a way, but would not eat for anything. And he knew that feeling, what it was like to turn away from things for lack of trust in yourself, to avoid pleasures as private penance.<br /> <br /> Severus bore the wounds, as Albus did, of someone who had seized his gift by the blade in the heat of impatience and ambition, and still felt the pain. The weight of the death of someone dear carried like a millstone you could not drop for fear of forgetting. But at least Severus knew who had truly struck the blow that took Lily&rsquo;s life even if he could not let go of the feeling of failure to protect someone important to him&hellip;<br /> <br /> But this was the wrong time for these notions.<br /> <br /> Albus shook his head firmly to clear away the mingled, muddled thoughts and associations before he could focus on Severus, who was paler than usual and staring into his mug.<br /> <br /> &quot;I find myself at a loss for how to proceed,&quot; Severus admitted at last, voice painfully quiet.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;While I understand this is not exactly the easiest situation for the two of you to resolve, I cannot continue to play moderator. I will assist you this time, but after this you&rsquo;re on your own,&rdquo; Albus said firmly. <br /> <br /> Severus nodded and took another deep drink of his chocolate. &ldquo;I understand sir.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Albus said quietly. <br /> <br /> Picking up a crisp square of parchment and his quill, Albus began jotting down a little note to <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>. &ldquo;You know, Severus, I think there is a task the two of you would be well suited for that does not involve Voldemort. Think of it as a training ground. The Mirror of Erised could use some cleaning, and I would certainly like to know as much about those that died in front of it as possible. Has <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> mentioned her request to be allowed out of the castle for research during the break?&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;No, she hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll kindly consent to escorting her it would be much appreciated, as you&rsquo;re capable of producing a Patronus. I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s going out to do a bit of field research for the Dementor project I asked her to put together. She has some theories she&rsquo;d like to test, and word from Remus is that there are a few stray Dementors taking up residence in an Irish castle. They may be starting a breeding cycle there.&rdquo; Albus folded the little note one last time before handing it over. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Of course, sir,&rdquo; Severus muttered. Rising from his chair with a determined look on his face, he pocketed the note and turned crisply on his heel before gliding to the door. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;One last thing, Severus,&rdquo; Albus said firmly. The younger man paused, hand on the door ready to open it, but he did not turn around. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I am once again compelled to remind you that your words are the most powerful magic you possess. Please be more mindful in your use of them&hellip;&rdquo; <br /> <br /> -***- <br /> <br /> Severus contemplated the little curled up form of <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> for a moment as she drooled a little on her pillow. It was almost a shame to wake her. Almost. Wrenching her jaw open, he let three drops of Wiggenweld trickle down her throat. Within seconds <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> was bolt upright in the bed sputtering and blinking rapidly.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Whathell!&rdquo; she muttered thickly before she noticed the little folded up parchment he&rsquo;d thrust in her face. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had to read the note several times, because she was yawning and blinking constantly for a few moments. Looking up suspiciously, she simply nodded to signify her consent. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Do you need anything unusual for this process?&rdquo; Severus asked in his coolest, most academic tone. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Chalk,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> replied shortly, heaving herself off the squashed feather mattress. Her movements were stiff and sluggish at first, as she rummaged in her trunk scrutinizing little strings of ornaments and embroidered belts before selecting a few and slinging them around her hips. Doing her best to smooth out her ruffled hair, she held out an expectant hand to receive a fresh stick of chalk and a firm wand tap to the head for Disillusionment. <br /> <br /> Their destination was in a remote room on ground floor of the North Wing. Severus ran a hand over the battered surface of the door which had no handle, and whispered the password (desire) into the keyhole. The door swung open to admit them to a long room with an entire wall of gothic windows whose iron grilles still sported remnants of gold leaf. The other walls retained faded remnants of a mural, but the smooth plastered surface had been chipped away in places to reveal the stone walls. <br /> <br /> Albus had told him this room was designed by Helga Hufflepuff as a solar, and Severus could hardly imagine how beautiful it would be in here during daylight hours with sunlight spilling over the smooth floor. The furnishings here were sparse: a few brocade chairs were clustered in a corner around a rickety table, and a large ancient loom had been pushed back against a wall. The mirror in question stood against the far wall - its gold frame glittering innocently wherever the light struck it. <br /> <br /> <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to the mirror, or anything else; she was staring out the window, apparently transfixed by the huge orange moon rising over the black mass of the forest. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>After a few moments of taking in the view, <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> turned and marched straight up to the mirror, not bothering with Severus or any questions. She stood so close to the massive thing that her breath fogged the glass, before she closed her eyes, sank to the floor and pressed her cheek and ear to it.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Seven people&hellip;&rdquo; she murmured, fingers skipping over the heavy gold carvings on the mirrors frame.<br /> <br /> Severus had settled into one of the chairs and laid a roll of parchment, quill and ink out, conjuring a little blue flame to dance above the table top. &ldquo;There is no record of the mirror&rsquo;s true age, or its creator. Its function is to display the very deepest desire of the viewer&rsquo;s heart. Albus would like to know as much as possible about the people trapped inside.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;You know, superstition dictates that you&rsquo;re supposed to cover all the mirrors in the house before someone dies or else they might get stuck,&quot; she said thoughtfully. &quot;But I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone thought about that when they were wasting away. The oldest person in here died in 1564, or so he says.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> She turned just a bit to flash him an imperious look that asked <i style="""">shouldn&rsquo;t you be writing this down</i>, apparently pleased to be an object of study instead of a figure of suspicion. Severus dashed that off, but he was more interested in watching her do the preliminary work for whatever ritual she had to conduct. <br /> <br /> While not as useful or efficient as wand magic, potions, or even astrology he saw certain elegance in the old ritual magic. Especially old Dark magic, but he was not so sure which category this would fall into. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Can you see anything in the mirror?&rdquo; Severus asked casually. He wouldn't go near that thing for all the money in the world. He already knew what he wanted, and to stand in front of that vicious reflection and see it all play out with no hope of touching it would be far too painful.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be able to once these people have been extricated.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>But that&rsquo;s not really what I&rsquo;m looking for. As it is, I only see fragments of their desires. Have you had a look, Mister Snape?&rdquo; Her expression was keen and curious, but it seemed that in her eagerness to get on the task she&rsquo;d forgotten the element of malice.<br /> <br /> In fact, the whole situation reminded him very much of their stolen study sessions - the far away, secret location, the note, and the exciting prospect of seeing something bizarre and learning something new.<br /> <br /> Severus decided not to waste this. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to do so,&quot; he lied, hoping it would not be blatantly obvious. &quot;This mirror was used as a guard a few years ago for the Philosophers Stone, but otherwise it has been locked up for the precise reason you are looking at it. We wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone dropping dead in front of a mirror because they were too stupid to get up and move on with life,&rdquo; he said harshly. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes, maybe more, passed in absolute silence as <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> leaned against the glass, listening intently to voices he could not hear. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;In the interest of- ah- scholarly curiosity how long do you estimate this process taking, Ms Mezarci?&rdquo; Severus muttered. There was, after all, a Ministry witch with a nasty grudge against half-breeds and freaks somewhere in the building. Hopefully Umbridge was locked in her office full of kitten patterned gimcracks, plotting Trelawney&rsquo;s doom. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Well they&rsquo;re hardly eager to leave; I need to identify them all to a certain degree before I&rsquo;ll know what sorts of wards to set. It could take a few hours in all honesty. If you&rsquo;d like to put on some music, I understand,&rdquo; she muttered, not bothering to look away from the mirror. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;That will not be necessary.&rdquo; Severus was deeply curious as to what she was seeing in that mirror and bit back the urge to say anything. Either <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> could sense that, or she simply didn&rsquo;t like the silence. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;The oldest one wanted a woman in the very worst way. The next is a warlord, blood thirsty for a great big Muggle genocide; he might be a bit harder to get out, goes on and on about opposing the oppression of Muggles so wizards may take their rightful place as rulers.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> Severus jotted all that down while she recited the victims with all the dispassionate flatness of a grocery list as <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> squinted and moved her finger down the mirror. She'd been tracing shadowy circles and interconnecting lines like a constellation map on the glass with the tip of her finger.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;And one last person, four years ago?&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> looked at him incredulously. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Ah, yes. I think I know who that is.&rdquo; Severus sneered involuntarily at the thought of stuttering, skinny Quirrell with the Dark Lord hidden underneath that ridiculous turban&hellip; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an absolute mess, all sorts of malignant influence,&rdquo; she muttered. &quot;This could be a problem to repair...&quot;<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Well being possessed by the Dark Lord for a year or two might do that to a person,&rdquo; Severus muttered. &ldquo;Have any of the others given you names?&rdquo;</p>  <span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;""><br /> &ldquo;The two holding out for their respective loves have forgotten their names. The demonologist is called Johannes Weyer, our warlord is Symeon of Durham, the playwright is named Robert Greene, and our actress is Anna Scott, and of course we have Quirinus Quirrell.&rdquo; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> said, scooting across the floor on her knees as she pulled the chalk out of her pocket. <br /> <br /> Positioning herself in the center of the room, Lourdes began the first of two large overlapping circles, filling them with lotus petal shapes and triangles, writing out spells in a fluid language with the strange constellation shape she had traced on the mirror at the center She stood back to survey her work, scrutinizing each line and every strange word, making small corrections here and there until she deemed it acceptable. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Could you please move that mirror into the center of this circle?&rdquo; She indicated the side with the web drawn into it. Severus complied, being extra cautious because he had no idea what effect shattered glass might have on the mirrors inhabitants. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;What language is that?&rdquo; he asked coolly, gesturing towards the swirling script that bordered the circles.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;<span style="""">Gongpe-ke</span>, twilight language,&rdquo; she replied, squinting as she leaned in to inspect a particular area. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;And those are mandalas?&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Sort of,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said, turning away from the chalk design with a final nod of approval. &ldquo;Are you sure you want to sit through this?&rdquo; <br /> <br /> &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; Severus asked, curiosity piqued by that last statement. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Most wizards don&rsquo;t ever see one soul, let alone seven. These aren't shades or ghosts, it's a fair bit more intense than those weak and wasting scraps. I shouldn't think you'll be in danger, the boundaries are unbroken and this is solid spell work but...&quot; she trailed off and bit her lip, both hands folding over the point on her chest where there had formerly been a sucking wound.<br /> <br /> &quot;I haven&rsquo;t had someone sit in on me in ages.&quot; <br /> <br /> Severus squirmed on the spot when she seemed to doggedly avoid looking at him. No, while this bore some resemblance to their study sessions it most definitely lacked the mutual air of arrogance and a desperate attempt to impress. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> spoke about the ritual frankly, almost deliberately so, as if plain speech was a charm to ward off disaster. Pride goeth before a fall - that much both of them knew...<br /> <br /> &quot;This wasn't my idea,&quot; he offered. He wondered vaguely if she'd become afraid of herself, after the imprisonment and the disastrous summon.<br /> <br /> &quot;I know, and it shouldn't be dangerous for me, this is complex work but it's relatively benign. Though I'm not sure about Quirrell. He&rsquo;s in terrible shape. I&rsquo;ve never tried to remove large scale possession damage before, I know the theories and I've done a little work, but to be honest it just doesn't turn up very often. I don't know exactly what he's been possessed by, or if it's more than one influence, but it's not safe to release it without analysis. But just in case&hellip;&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> sorted through the clattering amulets and innumerable pouches and strands of charm-pills and sticks wound with thread that hung off her belts and selected a small silver box with a large chunk of sickly blue turquoise set into the lid between the figures of dancing skeletons. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I brought a ghau just in case. I can trap Quirrell in here for safe keeping if it doesn&rsquo;t work out. I might have to do a little more research to send him off properly I can&rsquo;t finish it here.&rdquo; She snapped the ghau at him, opening and closing it like a set of jaws.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Do you have any idea what sort of price you could get for that at Borgin and Burkes?&rdquo; Severus stopped writing and stared intently at the little box, with a rather greedy glint in his eyes. Ghaus were considered Dark magical objects, certain types being incredibly handy for the keeping of many slippery, immaterial things. There were a number of rather sinister bits of magic you could do with one of those little boxes if you were so inclined, and foolhardy enough to attempt that sort of work as a wizard in this day and age. But they weren&rsquo;t easy to come by, as they were only ever made in a scant few secretive beyuls in <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Tibet</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the surrounding area and were tightly controlled family heirlooms. <br /> <br /> &rdquo;I might have a small fortune up in that box if I added up all the family ornaments, and this here.&rdquo; She pulled up a sleeve to display what looked like an innocent leather bracelet set with an eye charm of blue glass. She gave the charm a tug, extracting a wire that glowed hot sinister blue. &ldquo;This little beauty is a metal charmer&rsquo;s garrote. I trained it to recognize my flesh, but it cuts through other people like a hot knife through butter; dead useful.&rdquo; One more tug on the wire made it snap back into the leather band like an automatic tape measure. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Do you own any female adornments that aren&rsquo;t potential weapons?&rdquo; he smirked, raising an eyebrow and folding his arms over his chest, crushing his sheet of parchment. <br /> <br /> &quot;Gods no, what good would that do?&rdquo; It was when <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> laughed right then that Severus really recognized her. It was the smile, the laugh he only vaguely remembered from the better times.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>He knew her- that was the girl he&rsquo;d shared textbook revisions and revenge plots with, who concealed notes in cleverly titled library books for him to find, who cut through the Hog&rsquo;s Head on a crowded evening to spend her breaks drinking tea and making plans and boasts. It hadn't all been misery, fights, and failure. For all their sparring, and screaming matches, there <i style="""">had</i> been the triumphs, successes, and conspiratorial scraps of joy.<br /> <br /> He watched her face iron itself out, the crinkles at the corners of her eyes and the creases in her cheeks vanishing in an instant. Just as quickly as she had appeared, the traces of the <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> he&rsquo;d known retreated back behind that cracked fa&ccedil;ade. More important, though, was knowing that she was still in there somewhere&hellip; <br style="""" /> <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br /><a href=""http://mementomori-fic.livejournal.com/12192.html"">Part Two</a><br style="""" /> <!--[endif]--><br /></span></meta></meta></meta></meta>"

<p class=""MsoNormal"">It had only taken a quick glance around the main room for <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> to figure out that she&rsquo;d been stashed in Severus&#39; quarters at Hogwarts. Though, she could have guessed by the decor alone. The low ceilings, stone walls, and flood-proof mosaic floors were just like the ones in the Slytherin dorms. Only here every inch of wall space and the windows were covered in dark bookshelves crammed with books, flasks of potions or constituents, and the occasional odd curio.<br />
 <br />He had so many books, in fact, that there simply wasn&#39;t enough room for them on the shelves; a few heavy, metal-hinged tomes were propped up on stands and piles of smaller books sat in neat stacks on the floor next to boxes overflowing with un-filed notes. There was a secretary desk built in to the bookshelves but it was nigh on unusable at this point, its drawers and cubbies over flowed with spare sticks of sealing wax and rolls of letter-ribbon, parchment scraps and other resident junk.<br />
 <br />Clearly Severus didn&rsquo;t entertain guests here - there was no comfortable sitting area, or cozy sofas to lounge on, just a rickety tea table acting as a desk and two spindly chairs, one of which was occupied by a stack of books and papers. The dingy kitchen had nothing to eat, she&#39;d checked. The cupboards were filled with books, cauldrons, and cooking implements in various stages of decay, while the windowsills and counters had been turned into a makeshift greenhouse where quite a number of exotic plants were attempting to grow in the weak watery light filtered through the lake. Several fat, shiny black spiders hung on to webs in the kitchen corners, apparently they were the closest thing Severus had to pets (if you squinted and looked at them sideways they were kind of cute actually&hellip;).<br />
 <br />She didn&rsquo;t even have her own space here. There was only one bedroom, furnished with a great-bed so old that Salazar himself might have slept in it and a rickety wardrobe containing thirty copies of the same black robes. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> and her eight lock trunk had been relegated to a far corner by the bathroom where she slept on a little feather bed.<br />
 <br />She had objected loudly to being shuffled from one basement to another. After all a person needed sunlight and fresh air&hellip; freedom (and the name of the neighborhood drug dealer). Apparently Albus didn&rsquo;t see it that way, as he gently insisted that Severus should oversee her rehabilitation, and Severus was taking his job very seriously. The minute her trunk came through the door he riffled through every compartment and found all of her pipes, picked out her lamp, found every opium-laced cigarette, and all of the little white pills she carried when she knew it would be awhile until her next smoke. If she&rsquo;d harbored any hope of being doted on during the detoxification process, it was shattered when he tossed a bottle of disinfectant at her and left her alone to bandage her bleeding knees.<br />
 <br />The man had no bedside manner to speak of.<br />
 <br />But the withdrawal itself was ten times worse than any lecture or silent treatment Severus could dream up. When she&#39;d smoked there were no messy emotions to consider, she&#39;d just gone off to some warm, safe little part of her mind where it was quiet. She didn&rsquo;t think about the <i style="""">things</i> which were off limits, which were disturbing. Even the daily grind was easier with the opium - she could work for hours on a book restoration or forgery without distraction, and smoking had made her imprisonment at Grimmauld place seemed bearable.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Withdraw ripped down all those cautious mental barriers, and now too many memories to deal with at once were jamming her brain, screaming to be dealt with.<br />
 <br />Her body was revolting as well, with aching cramps in parts she could not properly locate, she could barely force herself to eat, even the task of crawling to the bathroom seemed too taxing at times. Day and night ran together for&hellip;well she couldn&#39;t be sure how long she&#39;d been here, suspended between asleep and awake in an oily sweat, gnawing on her fingers and muttering like (as Severus chose to put it) a prisoner in their first night at Azkaban.<br />
 <br />Severus steadfastly ignored her plight as if she were a house elf with a head cold. The bastard was a bloody potions master, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> though mutinously. He could have eased her down but instead he dropped her and watched her writhe like a maggot. He stood over her smugly as she choked down bowls of soup, or glasses of water, probably relishing the thought that she might be sick right afterward. Every sideways glance or flick of his upper lip seemed to convey the same nasty sentiment &ndash; who&rsquo;s the weak one now?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <br />At least hating Severus was useful. It gave her something concrete to deal with, and it was rather entertaining to imagine the numerous ways in which he might be killed and humiliated for forcing her off.<br />
 <br />When the worst of the withdrawal had ebbed away, it left only the &quot;mortal boredom of the smoker who is cured&quot; as that Muggle, Cocteau, put it. Time crawled by and it was everything she could do to keep herself busy, though she was so tired that all she really wanted to do was lay down and stare at the ceiling. While Severus was out doing whatever it was he did, Lourdes had spent seven restless and dusty days sprawled on the floor combing through his books, making lists for future reference on what needed to be repaired and what would need to be translated. Everything was meticulously organized and tidied despite Severus&rsquo; protests that there was indeed a system in place and she was going to spoil it. When the work around his quarters ran out, she wrote Aberforth three foot long rambling letters describing the events of her life she was now able to recall in perfect detail.<br />
 <br />Aberforth decided to try and remedy her boredom by sending her childhood spindle, great bats of home dyed yarn, and knitting needles. So <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> had taken to riding out the times Severus was in his quarters by hiding in the bathroom, trying to remember what Aberforth had taught her about knitting ages ago. When she was little her mother had taught <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> to spin to keep her occupied on long trips. The spinning, her knowledge of goat care, and a willingness to scrub out the filthiest of tankards had gotten her the job at the Hog&rsquo;s Head, and long evenings by the fire as she taught Aberforth how to transform the goats wool and he taught her how to knit it into something useful.<br />
 <br />Albus was encouraging this venture, possibly because he saw a few pairs of socks in the deal for himself, Aberforth hadn&rsquo;t knit him anything in ages. He called it &ldquo;an opportunity for meditative contemplation.&rdquo; She called it &ldquo;bloody frustrating,&rdquo; because the heels of the socks were coming out bunchy, and at points it was like wrestling with an unwieldy porcupine, but at least it was keeping her hands busy.<br />
 <br />Right now she was sitting in the huge marble bathtub in her under-things, relishing the coolness of the stone against her skin. She&rsquo;d propped a knitting manual against the long disused soap dish attempting to follow a diagram for a pair of Turkish rose pattern stockings. The situation gave her a clear view of her various scars so could <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> entertain herself between stitches by trying to remember where she&#39;d gotten a particular wound. Most were merely the side effect of being in Magical Law Enforcement, others were different, distinct. Like the scars across the palms of her hands - those had been inflicted with a bit more care.<br />
 <br />Her meeting with the Dark Lord left her with new scar where the demon wound had been, and of course the ugly skull and snake burned on her forearm. All of that was going to take some time to piece together, but she&rsquo;d formulated a plan for dealing with the situation using the only logical method she knew - research and data compilation.<br />
 <br />Just then, there was a sharp knock on the door.<br />
 <br />&quot;Ms Mezarci, are you decent?&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;Sure. I&#39;m in my underwear.&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;Get dressed. You&#39;re going to eat.&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;Aye aye, captain,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> grumbled under her breath, pretending the black wool ball was Severus&rsquo; head as she jammed the needles in to hold her place.<br />
 <br />-***-<br />
 <br />
 <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> shuffled out with a sullen expression on her face, wearing an obnoxious set of pajamas- bright blue flannel with a pattern of green pears. They were a gift from Aberforth upon discovering that her wardrobe wanted for proper nightwear. Apparently he still thought she was fifteen, given the all-engulfing cut and cartoonish colors. Somewhere along the line she&#39;d industriously knit herself a little pair of lurid green mitts to match them (though why she always wore them was beyond him, his quarters weren&rsquo;t that cold). The ensemble struck Severus as dishonest, the cheerful colors and patterns suggested she might be much more pleasant than she really was.<br />
 <br />&quot;How&hellip;charming,&quot; Severus said with a mocking sneer as she plopped into her chair and snatched up the Daily Prophet.<br />
 <br />&quot;Well, as off the mark as Aberforth may be on nightclothes, at least he took pains to make sure I didn&#39;t freeze to death.&quot; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> turned up her nose and propped up a copy of the Daily Prophet.<br />
 <br />&quot;And I took pains to make sure you didn&rsquo;t spend the rest of your miserable life face down in an opium den,&quot; he said lightly. It was just like <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>; completely ungrateful despite the obvious risk he had taken in bringing her here. Especially considering that she&#39;d spent seven years at Hogwarts without uttering so much as a thank you to Dumbledore, whose risk had been much greater.<br />
 <br />&quot;Of course, because who would you have to torture if you threw me back there hmm? No students to hiss at during the summer months so something must be better than nothing. Besides, you could be genuinely evil and just trying to butter me up.&rdquo;<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> let out a little hiss of anger thinly disguised as a snicker. &quot;I suppose you&#39;re angry because now you&#39;re not the imperiled spy out there suffering all on his lonesome. Honestly, if you want the credit you can have it.&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;Because you are here for your fee. And I don&#39;t expect you to stick around very long once you&#39;ve found a way to get your hands on it.&quot; Severus&#39; eyes flickered up from the supply list to see <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> twitching and seething as she turned the pages of the Prophet.<br />
 <br />&quot;Well would you look at this. Podmore arrested for trying to get through a door, five whole months just for that?&quot; She thrust the paper in front of him and drummed her fingers on the tabletop.<br />
 <br />&quot;You&#39;ll get more than that if we&#39;re caught,&quot; he retorted coolly. Actually <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> was likely to get a Dementors Kiss, if they could find anything to remove.<br />
 <br />&quot;If Albus doesn&#39;t come out in force for us I&#39;ll make it my mission living or dead to get back at him. I don&#39;t intend on going to prison&hellip;&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> bit off the end of that sentence fiercely as if she had just exposed something. &quot;And honestly Mr. Snape, the window of time in which you could have safely scared me out of this job has long passed. So you can stop trying to intimidate me now.&quot;<br />
 <br />He glanced over at her again; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>&#39; head was bent over a Turkish newspaper scanning the pages for any tidbits of interest. She looked completely unconcerned with the fact that only a few weeks ago she&#39;d made a pact with the Dark Lord and was going to be expected to contribute sooner or later...<br />
 <br />&quot;Have you finished the first set of the packets on Dementors?&quot; he muttered, feeling slightly annoyed that she could be so nonchalant about the whole thing.<br />
 <br />&quot;No,&quot; she grunted, &quot;I have a new project, very hush-hush.&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;I don&#39;t know why you couldn&#39;t finish both; it&#39;s not as if you&#39;re wanting for leisure time.&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;OH YES! It&#39;s been delightfully relaxing with the night sweats, and muscle cramps, and the vomiting! I really wish I could do it more often.&rdquo; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> said, in a tone thick with false cheer, wrinkling up her nose as she gave him a broad, toothy grin.<br />
 <br />&quot;You brought it on yourself,&quot; he replied coolly.<br />
 <br />&quot;I could make a case against that theory...&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;Spare me your excuses,&quot; Severus said with a dismissive wave of his hand.<br />
 <br />&quot;I&rsquo;m really starting hate you, you know,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> chirped.<br />
 <br />&quot;Then my work here is done.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />Suddenly, there was a loud pop and the Malfoy&#39;s old house elf appeared, under its usual mound of ratty sweaters and hats, bearing a serving tray laden with portions of roast boar with lingonberry preserves (cheeks for Severus, tenderloin for <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>), roasted root vegetables, goblets of mead, a pot of stewed tea and an envelope with a silver wax seal. &quot;Here you is Mister Snape, your letter came through the Floo. Dobby found it before the other house elves could see.&quot;<br />
 <br />It looked rather pleased with itself, and Severus merely rolled his eyes at the elf&#39;s enthusiasm. &quot;That will be all. And remember, under no circumstances are you to mention to anyone except Dumbledore that I have a guest.&quot; Snape jerked a thumb towards <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>, who smiled and gave it a little fingertip wave.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The elf nodded vigorously, apparently pleased to be entrusted with such an important secret, before vanishing with another sharp pop.<br />
 <br />&quot;You don&#39;t think that elf could get me some decent tea do you?&quot; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> asked slyly, sawing an ungainly chunk of meat free from her tenderloin. She grumbled about how weak and bland the tea from the kitchen was compared to the tea she was accustomed to. And she&#39;d been eyeing his personal teapot with much suspicion. Rightly so, Severus kept his own stash of unusual teas and had been hoarding them to spite her.<br />
 <br />&quot;It has more important things to do. After all, this building has upwards of hundred toilets. I think that chore would rank about two above fetching tea for an addict.&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;You know, those elves are dead talented at cleaning up hopeless messes. Maybe you could get one of them to help you brush your teeth? You&rsquo;ve got a little something&hellip;right here.&rdquo;<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> bared her teeth and used her finger to indicate her whole mouth.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Ouch,&rdquo; Severus muttered, looking up to give her a condescending look.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got to give me points for style,&rdquo; she said breezily. &ldquo;That letter is from Malfoy I assume? He&#39;s a little late getting back...&quot;<br />
 <br />He only grunted a little in reply before applying the charm needed to decode a letter from a fellow Death Eater. Lucius, for all his private brutality, had excellent manners, and that showed through in his letters, even when he was determined to undermine and insult.<br />
 <br />-***-<br />
 <br />Dear Severus,<br />
 <br />I hope this letter finds you, and your new pet, in good health and spirits. As our Lord requests, I am writing to update you on several details you may have missed in your current position. Perhaps you will recall those many years ago when you brought to our Lord&#39;s attention a certain prophecy, that we now know to be incomplete. Of course no one can fault you for being so rudely ejected from a shabby establishment such as the Hogs Head, most especially before you could hear the ending of such an important piece of information.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <br />Now our Lord is most eager to discover the ending of this particular prophecy, as it quite likely contains information that will give him the advantage in battle. While I am sure he is most pleased that you have delivered your little gift, who may prove to be exceedingly useful in the future, right now the most pressing concern is with obtaining the prophecy which has been stowed away within the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry.<br />
 <br />As I have spent the past few years building bridges with certain influential members of our Ministry, I am afforded access to the building and its employees without suspicion. Our comrade in arms, Avery, has of late been our informant in all matters concerning the department&#39;s inner workings. His observations however, are second-hand accounts supplied to him by Augustus Rookwood.<br />
 <br />Thus far we have only made one attempt to infiltrate this area of the ministry, and I am sad to say it was unsuccessful. If you should stumble upon any useful bits of information concerning this prophecy or any ideas for accessing it, would be most pleased to discuss them with you. I know you most of all would want to be of assistance to our Lord in this most vital hour, as your recent gift will assure your usefulness in the future.<br />
 <br />Yours Sincerely,<br />Lucius Malfoy<br />
 <br />-***-<br />
 <br />Severus was studying the letter with a sort of distant amusement that made <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> extremely curious. &quot;What is it? What&#39;s he say?&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;Nothing we don&rsquo;t already know.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It seems that Malfoy doubts your value to the Dark Lord. Seems to think that Avery&#39;s half cooked theories on how to get into the Department of Mysteries are going to prove more valuable.&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;Malfoy can&#39;t help if he&#39;s short sighted, can he?&quot; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> snorted.<br />
 <br />Severus raised an eyebrow and gave her a dark look. &quot;With talk like that Ms Mezarci, people might think you are genuinely dedicated to the Dark Lords service...&quot;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Speaking of,&rdquo; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> began hesitantly, &ldquo;the Dark Lord&rsquo;s first request has made me think I&rsquo;ll need to do things I haven&rsquo;t done in a very long time.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt if I was allowed some time and space to practice like I had in school &ndash; in the forest if it can be managed. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Nobody monitors the activity there, as far as I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;I will do what I can, Ms Mezarci, to see that you make yourself adequately prepared.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I should wonder though, why you were brought if you are so sorely out of practice&hellip;&rdquo; he replied, raising an eyebrow for an expression which was both mocking and condescending.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Well, you know.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>In my day to day life I&rsquo;ve found that there&rsquo;s little need to say, summon up something eldritch, do a bit of necromancy, or set control over demons or a spirit.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Raising a corpse army though &ndash; that&rsquo;s every Christmas,&rdquo; she hissed, stabbing at her carrots and potatoes.<br />
 <br />They fell back into silence, and she glanced up surreptitiously over the top of her newspaper as he began his reply. Severus Snape, she noted, was a very ugly man. And he only seemed to get uglier the more time she spent with him. Well it wasn&#39;t so much that he was actually unattractive, if he actually tried bathing and standing up straight he might have a bit of novel appeal (if you liked your men as skinny and pale as an Edgar Allen Poe character). He&rsquo;d been&hellip;sort of cute at school if you discounted the terrible haircuts he had until fourth year, when he finally grew into that beak of his. No, it was all the dammed up hate, stale secrets, and the grudges he was still clinging to that made him really ugly.<br />
 <br />Neither of them had bothered to discuss what they&#39;d done for the past seventeen years. He was definitely eager to avoid any discussion about himself at all costs, and true to form had also completely refused to hear anything she might have to say on why she&#39;d effectively stopped working and started cultivating an addiction.<br />
 <br />
 <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had begun a mental list of all his recent habits and tics to get a better idea of what he might have done in the meantime, the same sort of system she&#39;d used when pursuing a mark. The system had never failed her before.<br />
 <br />&quot;Putting off your work to read fairy tales again?&quot; he sneered, pointing to the book of South East Asian folk tales Lourdes had just opened in search of a story about a wizard named Punchkin and a witch named Bidasari she&rsquo;d heard as a little girl. &quot;Wasn&#39;t that the cause of your miserable performance in school?&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;I topped you on every essay we ever had to write,&rdquo; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> sneered, &ldquo;and every test.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />&ldquo;And yet failed every practical&hellip;&rdquo; Severus replied, tapping his cheek with a finger thoughtfully.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Practical indeed,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> snorted. &ldquo;How often have you turned a pincushion into a porcupine? Besides I am not reading fairy tales Mister Snape. I am researching the historical concept of the external soul in folk literature. Albus&#39; idea.&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> tore off a little piece of parchment and slipped it into the book to mark her spot before adding it to the pile next to her chair.<br />
 <br />&quot;Is that so? And this is more useful than patterns in Dementor behavior...how?&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;Vastly more useful. Albus has been clarifying theories about how the Dark Lord survived the killing curse, and how he might have gotten started. He gets to do the legwork, I get to do the book work,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> grumbled, gnawing absentmindedly on the end of her quill.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;There&rsquo;s really only one way to do that&hellip;now,&rdquo; Severus said, condescendingly.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;There are more things in heaven and earth, Mister Snape, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. You&rsquo;re so sure you&rsquo;ve got it all figured out aren&rsquo;t you? The modern way, the western way, wands and Latin?&rdquo; She raised an eyebrow and propped her fist against her chin.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Well, several centuries of blending magical traditions across the continent to discover the most effective method for channeling and enhancing inherent magical power does tend to prove its own worth,&rdquo; he muttered, glancing at her, and then his wand as if there were no compariason.<br />
 <br />Severus was right at it again, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> thought smugly, it was still dead easy to wind him up.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Oooh that&rsquo;s right, magic is might, might is right. Forgot all about that. After all you are descended from the great European tradition that&rsquo;s systematically managed to wipe out most diversity, inbreed to the point of evolutionary backpedaling, humiliate those who happen to be born without your specific strain of ability, enslave creatures you find threatening&hellip; did I miss anything?&rdquo;<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Only the centuries of advancement and invention, discovery and&hellip;&rdquo; he began.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;HA! That&rsquo;s rich. If YOU lot steal it from someone else its discovery! And the rest of the world are just a whole lot of brutal savages, mucking about with our primitive ways!&rdquo;<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Simply because the majority have advanced beyond bleeding and chanting&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Advanced at a price - watered down magic,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> spat. &ldquo;Anything to get around seers, psychometrics, Evocators, or anyone else a little out of the ordinary! Puppet corpses, stones of resurrection?&rdquo; She brandished a copy of an English bard&rsquo;s fairy tale book at him. &ldquo;Who do you reckon really came up with that?&rdquo;<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>She jerked her head upward haughtily to stare down her nose at him.<br />
 <br />&quot;An allegorical figure, perhaps? Don&#39;t suppose you could call on a dead someone for the answer,&quot; Severus smirked. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that why they brought you up here?&rdquo;<br />
 <br />&quot;Well if you&rsquo;re so clever why don&rsquo;t you tear something out of the great beyond and get the answer yourself? If I had to perform a ritual to answer every one of your more difficult homework questions I&#39;d have sacrificed enough of my own life to have been dead by the time I was twenty,&quot; Lourdes said coolly, rolling her eyes and moving on to a book of Bulgarian folk tales bristling with slips of marked paper jutting out of the pages.<br />
 <br />&quot;So...what did you tell him?&quot; she asked, raising an eyebrow and pointing to the letter Severus was examining again.<br />
 <br />&quot;Only the usual - we appreciate his patronage, we&#39;re doing everything we can, and we&rsquo;re restricted in what we can do by the position here in the school and the fact that you&#39;re supposed to be dead.&quot; He scanned the letter, ticking off points paragraph by paragraph.<br />
 <br />&quot;How the hell are we supposed to give him a shove in the right direction if we don&#39;t know what they&#39;ve already tried to get in?&rdquo; she sputtered.<br />
 <br />&quot;Once again Ms Mezarci, your level of social short sightedness astounds me. Lucius Malfoy does not want our help. He is merely making it explicitly clear where he sits right now, and that&#39;s higher than the two of us. I told you before, all this has very little to do with furthering the Dark Lords intentions, its about making sure you&#39;re as close to power as you can possibly get while keeping everyone else as far away as possible. Avery is a great deal easier to manipulate than I am so he is vastly more useful to Lucius. So right now we are playing a waiting game.&quot;<br />
 <br />&quot;And we have no idea what Avery is telling him?&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> sighed.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Unfortunately, I have no connections to Avery. A letter to him would be entirely too suspicious so I have to hope that Malfoy can be plied. Albus has taken the other Order members off shifts at the Department of Mysteries until things at the Ministry settle down a bit. After what happened to Podmore we simply cannot risk having any more members on duty until the Ministry security either increases so that we do not need to patrol or more likely, Death Eaters loose interest in patrolling the area and the Order members are less likely to be caught,&rdquo; Severus muttered.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a coincidence do you? Podmore gets caught after Malfoy&hellip;&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> last words were garbled by a wide yawn as she slumped down on the table and blew at a few strands of hair stuck to her eyelashes.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Now we know it&rsquo;s not a coincidence Ms Mezarci. Few people would question Lucius to begin with, not when he&rsquo;s throwing so much money at the Ministry.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Too right. Your ministry&rsquo;s been rotting from the inside out since that blood-status-worshiping dullard took office. Closing down to cover up &ndash;&ldquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> stopped, feeling for the second time that evening, as though she had just avoided tumbling into a spear pit.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;And how would you know that?&rdquo; Severus asked sharply.<br />
 <br />&quot;I read the papers,&rdquo; she replied.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;In any case if someone at the Ministry had suspected him I would wager he cleared that right up with a bribe. I&rsquo;m sure the Ministry did everything they could to get Podmore to implicate Dumbledore though,&rdquo; he sneered.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Everything they could?&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said darkly, her fingers twitching against the table uncomfortably.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <br />&ldquo;Ms Mezarci, if Podmore holds out after that time with Dementors and is still loyal to Dumbledore he would be as forgiving as that&hellip;what was his name?&rdquo; Severus&rsquo; brow furrowed as he tried to finish his metaphor.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Job,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> finished. &ldquo;And if you ask me, Job was stupid and his god was cruel.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />-***-<br />
 <br />No good deed, it seemed, went unpunished. Severus had searched for a way to get her back OUT of his quarters once it became clear that keeping her under watch was going to be a great deal more awkward than he&#39;d initially anticipated. If she was not in the bathroom she was content to glare at him from behind her books (and she kept leaving half finished socks in the tub).&nbsp;&nbsp; There was something</p>

<br />He&#39;d even tried talking to Aberforth about taking her in, and he&#39;d been quite amiable about it until Severus had brought up his involvement in her little substance abuse problem. Aberforth had become immediately hostile and declared that he&#39;d assist <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> in any way she felt necessary. Besides, Aberforth had said pointedly, the Hogs Head wasn&#39;t exactly the place you stored something that needed to be kept a secret.<br />
<br />Not exactly as direct as his brother, that was for sure. Severus had had almost no luck in regaining the trust of that particular member of the Dumbledore family. Especially considering Aberforth had irrationally decided to hold him responsible for <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>&#39; supposed death and possibly several other murders. As for his absolute willingness to do anything she asked despite the legal consequences?

</p>To make matters much, much, worse Dumbledore had been forced to give Fudge a foothold into Hogwarts with the advent of some ridiculous educational act. And Fudge appointed a beastly little toad of a woman named Dolores Umbridge who, according to McGonagall and Flitwick, had already taken the time to corner some of her future coworkers and wring out as much information on Dumbledore&#39;s practices as possible.<br />

<br />Unpleasant women had emerged from every crevice to assume his jobs...if Dumbledore did not think him capable of maintaining the delicate balance of allegiances alone that was fair enough.

They were both out of breath and the woman, dressed in drab molting gray, looked as though she might drop dead on the spot. Severus genuflected automatically, but had to give a mighty tug on the woman's robes before she toppled onto her knees.<br /> <br /> &quot;And what have we here?&quot; He gestured towards the panting woman, not bothering to leave his niche. <br /> <br /> &quot;An Evocator, my Lord.&quot; Severus seemed to have caught his breath and he kept his gaze fixed on the ground. <br /> <br /> &quot;For your sake, I do hope so. You know how very much I hate liars.&quot; He ambled over to Severus smoothly and took a deep breath, sniffing the air by his head and contemplating for a moment. <br /> <br /> Not a great deal of guilt about him, but there was an uncharacteristic amount of hopeful apprehension. With a twist of his fingers, Voldemort lifted Severus into the air as easily as he would a marionette, and slipped inside his mind. <br /> <br /> One of the more frustrating aspects of Legilimency was that one needed to be looking for something in order to find it. With a little effort he had found a dim, scratchy memory of Severus as a schoolboy - lip turned up and arms crossed stubbornly over his chest as he watched the bedraggled woman as a girl. <br /> <br /> She crouched in the dirt, scratching circles and symbols into the ground in the <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:placename w:st=""on"">Forbidden</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st=""on"">Forest</st1:placetype></st1:place>. <i style="""">See what I can do?</i> she hissed before stabbing the ground with a heavy foreign knife, drumming her thighs with her hands as she muttered a little charm-song, leaning in and pursing her lips as if she were about to blow the fluff off a dandelion. Something crackled and exploded in front of her, a miniature firework in a shower of silver sparks before it took shape. A minor air demon, if Voldemort recalled correctly, which hovered in form between the shape of a tiger and a wind gust. <br /> <br /> The girl showed no fear of it, in fact she seemed to regard it as a playmate. And it reciprocated, lifting her off her feet, swirling around her as she giggled and twisted in mid-air.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><span style="""">&nbsp;</span>Her expression when she confronted a slack jawed Severus was smug. She seemed to think of this summoning, an arcane and dangerous art for even the most practiced of wizards in any age, as a game played with all the childish abandon of blind man's buff.<br /> <br /> There was a rush of other memories, spirits and ghosts, and something else, huge and malevolent being summoned in the damp darkness of a cellar...<br /> <br /> &quot;Interesting,&quot; Voldemort said appraisingly. He released Severus, who tumbled to the ground in a heap while he approached the woman.<br /> <br /> &quot;And what is your name?&quot; he whispered as he leaned over her, flicking a finger to force her chin upwards. Voldemort could hear the sounds of muffled bells and charms under her traveling cloak when she arched her back. <br /> <br /> &quot;<st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> Mezarci.&quot; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> She did have the eyes; the same green a Death Curse left hanging around a corpse. The rest of her was less than impressive - scarred face, missing ear, gaunt body evident in her protruding collarbone and the ribs he could see under the skin on her chest. Her mind was equally damaged, full of memories that lurched and flickered as he perused them, the smell of fire blackened flesh, the scent of blood and earth, the weight of iron all reduced to sensory snippets by some drug. <br /> <br /> Everything he needed was right there; she was poisoned by bitterness, floating through life without aim or purpose. That aimlessness was a problem he was only too happy to remedy. <br /> <br /> Under the damage in her mind Voldemort quickly found the connection to a sort of magic that seemed too old and primal to belong to a human frame. It was so abundant that he could see its form. It was frighteningly calm, spread like an inky black cloud with innumerable nautilus-tendrils, entirely different from the colorful clouds and sparks that indicated magic in most wizards&hellip;<br /> <br /> And it was after him, a chilly tendril that bloomed in to his mind and floated there for a moment as if it could not decide which direction to go. The fear of it gripped him at the core, and the air of darkness and age that had entered with it made Voldemort feel as though he were a child in the orphanage again - alarmed and thrilled by the thing that was gathering within him and the promise it made. <br /> <br /> Her magic made him a promise as well. He could have death's servant, a foul incarnation of the weakness lesser men succumbed to without a fight, under his mark...<br /> <br /> When he could push past the black fronds that skimmed the edges of his consciousness as he ventured further, he noticed another whisper of malignant magic, appearing as a deep aubergine clot, around her heart. <br /> <br /> &quot;And this?&quot; Voldemort asked, maintaining practiced indifference as he pressed his palm to the center of her chest. <br /> <br /> &quot;An accident.&quot; There was a sharp twist of shame in her chest that failed to show up on her cheeks.<br /> <br /> &quot;What sort?&quot; he coaxed, fingers running the length of her collarbone.<br /> <br /> &quot;I...Severus, there was a summon, I lost control and the chthonic thing attempted to claim my heart as fee before I could exorcize it -&quot; she gasped, lower lip vanishing between her teeth, and blood blossoming underneath them when her face twisted into a grimace. &quot;After that all I remember is <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Turkey</st1:country-region></st1:place>, and work there as a book dealer, and an enforcer...&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;What did you take for the pain?&quot; He gave her a look that imitated sympathy well.<br /> <br /> &quot;Something to make me sleep,&quot; she said, he caught another flicker of shame on her part, and let a hateful smile creep over his face. <br /> <br /> That made perfect sense, she had so little cunning that it was not hard to believe she'd smoked her life away while working a dead end job, petty thuggery and intimidation when she had all that power under the lock of a memory charm. What an unsuitable task for someone with so much...potential.<br /> <br /> &quot;Severus found me, and broke the memory charms,&quot; she added enthusiastically. <br /> <br /> &quot;And how is it that I am meeting this remarkable little creature just now?&quot; Voldemort turned slowly towards Severus who did not dare look up when addressed, but there was a sly smile playing on his lips.<br /> <br /> &quot;Years as Head of Slytherin house afforded me many opportunities to peruse the Headmaster's office during his summer jaunts. I was only recently alerted to a file, in possession of the schools Healer of all people, which contained information about the historical practice of drawing out malignant magic from severe wounds. Ms Mezarci was, as you now know, wounded by a chthonic entity during your first rise.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>She was not dead, as I thought, only patched and hidden away. Information about her treatment and current location was included in the file so I took my own jaunt to retrieve her.&quot; Severus said lightly. <br /> <br /> Voldemort had previously been well aware of Lourdes Mezarci's presence, he'd heard the rumors about her unusual condition. Upon reflection, it seemed many of the things he could have used the first time around had been protected at the Hog's Head- that prophecy, and this particular witch, and botched by Severus. But young <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had always been by the side of formidable Hogs Head barman during holidays, that or safely tucked away within Hogwarts the rest of the year&hellip;<br /> <br /> &quot;Your blood is pure, it must be,&quot; he said. &quot;This condition does not occur in mongrels.&quot; He traced the script under her eyes with a fingertip, feeling her lean into the touch. The tattoos held no special magic except that which would make them impossible to remove, they were merely warnings. <br /> <br /> &quot;What a journey your patron has taken to bring you to me, tell me did you come willingly? Or have you been coerced?&quot; Voldemort looked at her greedily, thinking of the things he could use her for, the fear she could instill&hellip; <br /> <br /> &quot;When Severus told me the great things you have done, and mean to do, I had to come,&quot; she breathed. <br /> <br /> &quot;You wish to belong&hellip;&quot; Voldemort leaned in to whisper in her disfigured ear. And then, despite what must have been her very best effort, he could feel the weak heart leap in her chest. <br /> <br /> Oh, this was very suitable indeed, talent and desperation had proven a much more reliable combination than talent and ambition. For his followers at least&hellip;<br /> <br /> -***- <br /> <br /> &quot;I do.&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> injected those words with as much absolute devotion as she could. <br /> <br /> Both her knees were bleeding into her robes after Severus' unnecessarily rough shove into the rocks, and her brain was swimming. Recalling every fact and snippet she'd learned about him, to put it all together with what she was seeing now. There were shadowy figures milling about behind Voldemort, the distant sound of whispers and water, vine draped trees that opened up to a black sky hung with piercingly clear, bright stars and a sickle crescent of a moon. <br /> <br /> Severus had not lied when he said Voldemort was an incomparable Legilimens, his method was slow, gentle, and deliberate. <br /> <br /> In his pursuit of memories he almost became part of her. He didn't stay long, he couldn't. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> had felt <i style="""">it</i> surging up through her blood to drive him out. Putting on the act was easy though, she'd read enough about Voldemort to know what he would want to see &ndash; pliancy, the suggestion that she could be molded and used, with no resistance returning only utmost devotion. It stung her pride to pretend to be listless, but it had to be done...<br /> <br /> &quot;It is one thing to possess magic, but another to be able to use it,&quot; Voldemort said suddenly, with a look of distant disinterest. <br /> <br /> &quot;I understand you can harness this to extract knowledge from the deceased. Why&hellip;I believe I would like to see such a thing. If you can remember how...&quot;<br /> <br /> This was the sort of request that made her lose her temper every time someone had asked. Entities, life, souls were one thing, but the sanctity of the dead was quite another. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> bit down fiercely on the inside of her cheek and forced a docile smile.<br /> <br /> &quot;What ever my Lord requests. Who is it that you wish to hear from?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;There is a hag buried very near here, a seer with great power. She made many prophecies; see if she can find me what I want&hellip;&quot; Voldemort flicked his wand, and a small silver knife fell on the ground in front of her. &quot;Call for Ursula Sontheil.&quot;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><br /> The knife told her how Voldemort wanted this done.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>There were so many ways to seek the dead; the drumming and ecstatic dance, immersion in water in a trance, or a careful katabasis.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The knife meant blood, and blood meant the nekyia &ndash; a spell <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> had only performed a few times. Papa had told her over and over that it was a rotten perversion of Evocator magic, she was never to perform it outside of the academic realm. Not quite a necromancy, but this spell shared common roots with the abhorred practice. Man's destiny, her father warned her, was forever shifting, there was no reason to violate the peace of death for knowledge which would reveal itself in due course. The case of Saul, Samuel, and the Evocator at Endor was warning enough.<br /> <br /> <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> rifled for her wand inside her skirt pockets, cypress and Thestral heartstring. It was largely useless to in her case, though it made a rather nice tool for drawing in the dirt. <br /> <br /> She struggled out of her heavy boots and discarded her thick cloak, revealing heavily carved strands of bones, bells, mirrors and embroidered belts with totems and disintegrating silk pouches filled with amulets or guardian boxes. All the things she might need to work. <br /> <br /> <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> knelt to scratch a little triangle in the cold rocky ground, before pulling her robe off the left shoulder. Wincing slightly, she gave the meat of her shoulder one quick slash with the knife, before the ground within the triangle was stained black with blood. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>She didn't have the heart to ask for an animal to kill, so it was her blood that would lend life enough to the spirit. In any case, Wizard's blood always produced the best answers, small animals tended to provide fuzzy reception at best.<br /> <br /> It was only fragments of the dead that she could entice with this spell. Not like the ghosts at Hogwarts, or the others that lingered, invisible, in familiar places. She might have been able, with patience and a bit of time to find Ursula and have a nice quiet chat with her without being so rude, but that distinctly subtle method never went over well with people predisposed to loud flashy things. <br /> <br /> Hastily, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> stretched her wand arm out to trace a circle around herself, part protection, part showmanship. It kept people away from her at any rate; any wizard knew the boundary of a circle was never to be crossed. The ceremony was a fairly simple one, but it required so much focus that she was going to have to forget about Voldemort and the mass of shadowy men behind him. If she couldn't keep the spirit firmly under her thumb, it might be able to break the confines of the triangle and go for her body, or worse, head for someone else. <br /> <br /> Standing slowly, and taking the deepest breath she could manage, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> began pounding out a rhythm with her bare feet. Two slow steps and one quick, which made those heavy belts of charms and bells jingle in time. Concentrating on the rhythm and the name she had been given, before she began the incantation. It was hard at first, to shed the self-conscious feeling that there were people watching, but gradually the world outside the circle slid out of focus as she kept time and muttered the charm in the lowest register she could force her voice to reach.<br /> <br /> It was working. There was a spark in the triangle, flickering and sputtering before appearing as a little eddy of light just barely touching on the ground soaked in her blood. <br /> <br /> Contacting it caused a violent rush of scenes from an unfamiliar life to flash erratically before her eyes. Suddenly she was speaking to a man in red, smelling sulfur and water, surrendering a misshapen child to a nun. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> sank to her knees to address her, it, Ursula. <br /> <br /> <i style="""">My apologies, Ursula Sontheil.</i> <br /> <br /> <i style="""">What are you?</i> The voice demanded.<br /> <br /> <i style="""">An Evocator.</i> <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> replied simply as the light sputtered with realization <br /> <br /> <i style="""">We are not so different then, you and I.<br /> <br /> I must disagree Ursula, I don't like the taste of flesh. </i><st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> had to bite the inside of her cheek to avoid baring her teeth when Ursula made that nasty little comparison. Hags and Evocators were alike in that it was possible for them to take life from others, there were not many other parallels. <br /> <i style=""""><br /> Oh but you prefer to suck the life and souls right out of them, you little Dementor. You should learn to savor the taste of life in the blood&hellip; I wish I could taste what you ran into the dirt. <br /> </i><br /> The bitch was baiting her now, and <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> felt sorely tempted to scatter all parts of Ursula to the wind to teach her a lesson in manners when dealing with an Evocator. But when the little eddy of light pulsed with a deep, aching longing for taste of blood - life - <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> felt strangely sorry for her and refocused.<br /> <br /> <i style="""">I need one of your prophecies,</i> <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> pressed.<br /> <br /> <i style="""">For who?</i> <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> answered by concentrating on the image and impression of Voldemort, trying to convey everything she'd learned. <br /> <br /> <i style="""">Well in that case&hellip;</i> the quality of the energy changed very slightly, becoming low and fathomless. <br /> <br /> <i style="""">And before the race is built anew, a silver serpent comes to view. And spew out men of like unknown to mingle with the earth now grown. But those who gape out for others' death, their own, unlooked for, comes about. Earth he did seek; ere long, he shall have of earth his fill; within his grave.<br /> <br /> </i><st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> felt her eyes roll back and her head loll on her neck while her lips moved automatically, mouthing the words. She very vaguely recalled hearing the loud peal of a bell nearby and ground her teeth to regain control of the situation. <br /> <br /> <i style="""">Ursula Sontheil, your service is much appreciated. I release you with my thanks. </i><br /> <br /> Flashing the flicker of energy a brief smile she rose to her feet again to perform the counter-spell. It was much easier, Ursula seemed eager to get out of her reach and put up little resistance. After a few moments of negotiating a passage, the little eddy of light folded into itself, disappearing with a pop as the ground inside the triangle cracked. <br /> <br /> Knees shaking wildly, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> collapsed in a clatter of ornaments. Her brain was throbbing, her robes were soaked in sweat, and stained dark at the shoulder where she was still bleeding. The air was humming and through blurred vision she could see a cloud of moths fluttering around her head. <br /> <br /> They were attracted to the light from the spell, and one fat, fuzzy little creature lit on the flat of her cheek. As <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> struggled against the limp, weak feeling overtaking all her limbs, the moth let out a shrill squeak and hummed, fluttering down to rest on her chest by the blood stain to reveal its identity. <br /> <br /> Deaths Head Moth. <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> smiled weakly at the downy little brown and gold insect. It wasn't frightening by any means, but the poor thing had been labeled the harbinger of death, war, and pestilence. <i style="""">I suppose you arrived just in time, hum?</i><br /> <br /> The moth took off the moment Voldemort approached with the crowd of unfamiliar men, with their masks off and hoods down as they formed a circle around her. <br /> <br /> &quot;I trust I have pleased you, my Lord?&quot; she panted, making a noble attempt to sit up straight. <br /> <br /> &quot;Stand,&quot; Voldemort commanded, lifting her to her feet with another flip of his fingers. <br /> <br /> &quot;Do you pledge your life to your Lord?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;I do.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you vow to serve me in all that you do; to be my tool, my servant?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;I do.&quot; His eyes bored into hers, and <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> felt a strange tension in the air. Like the awkward moment before someone decides whether or not to kiss you. Indeed, there was something distinctly lustful about his gaze, and the way his finger meandered down her jaw and the curve of her neck. It wasn't the body he wanted, that was inconsequential. He wanted the power. <br /> <br /> &quot;Know this; for your deeds which please me, you will be rewarded. For your disobedience or mistakes, you will be severely punished. It is a lifetime of service or your death. But, I will give you the position you deserve; there will be no limits for you. Your life is mine now.&quot; Voldemort's fingers brushed her face, skimming over her mouth, his eyes glittering malevolently as he twisted her left arm up into the air. <br /> <br /> His gaze penetrated her weakened defenses without warning and in an instant she could see an old, darkened memory &ndash; herself as a child hauling the body of her father up the stairs at the <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:placetype w:st=""on"">Tower</st1:placetype>  of <st1:placename w:st=""on"">Silence</st1:placename></st1:place>. The muscles in her back, and her hands burned all over again from pulling the sheet her father's body was cocooned in step by step to the top, struggling with the heavy load. The worst thing of all was reliving raw, aching, hopeless feeling of loss and the fear of being alone.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Not anymore, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>. You belong now.&rdquo; His sympathy was at once revoltingly false and cheap, but still strangely and disgustingly appealing to the root of her. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>But she did not have time to linger on it.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You have a purpose now,&quot; he whispered, the fingers of his wand hand brushing her cheek and cradling the side of her head. But in an instant all of that vanished and he pressed his wand to her arm, just below her elbow and hissed a charm she could not understand.<br /> <br /> His magic shot through her body like fire, making her dizzy and scarcely aware that a brand was being etched on her forearm. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> fell, watching the fading wards and echoes of spells dance across her eyelids. <br /> <br /> -***- <br /> <br /> He followed the sound of jingling bells and mirrors, following <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>, who was stumbling frantically down the trail. <br /> <br /> She'd gone out cold once she'd received the mark, and the Dark Lord had taken that time to mend the slash on her shoulder, and the gaping wound in her chest. He'd siphoned the demon's magic out of her skin into his own and knit the flesh together, replacing the wound with a pale, starburst shaped scar. When he'd plucked the gold filaments out of her skin he'd hissed with disapproval upon examining them. The wound's repair bore undeniable hallmarks of Albus Dumbledore's magic. <br /> <br /> Severus had had to thank the Dark Lord for her acceptance into the fold on her behalf, profusely and with much hem kissing. Then the Dark Lord, apparently very satisfied with the prophecy and with Lourdes herself, had rewarded Severus by ordering Malfoy to take him and the new 'creature' under advisory again. Malfoy had merely given Severus a very sleek smile and promised a letter in the normal manner the very next day.<br /> <br /> No doubt Lucius regarded the introduction of <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> as a threat to his position, but Severus knew Lucius could be plied with the usual attitude of deference and appreciation. <br /> <br /> Severus stopped suddenly, realizing he'd lost <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>' trail, and listened closely for the sound of bells in the leaves. The only sound was a very loud splash, and he charged through the trees to find her floundering into the lower pool of the glen's waterfall. <br /> <br /> &quot;Ms Mezarci!&quot; he hissed, watching as she bobbed in the water with only the top of her head and eyes above the surface like a crocodile. &quot;Get out at once. I will let your miserable drowned corpse drift out to sea before I drag you all the way back to Hogwarts.&quot; <br /> <br /> She crept out of the water slowly, sodden robes clinging to her rail thin body, steam rising off her as if she had been fire heated and quenched by the blacksmith. Fishing around in her pocket, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> withdrew that suspicious little silver case and looked disheartened when she saw damp cigarettes. <br /> <br /> &quot;I hate doing&hellip;that,&quot; she muttered, as if the Dark Lord had just forced her to eat something particularly unpleasant. <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> cursed profusely under her breath as she flicked the wheel of a large lighter, with little success. <br /> <br /> &quot;Can you spare a light?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;I think not. While certain others are willing to turn a blind eye to your opium habit, I assure you that I will not be so&hellip; permissive,&quot; Severus grumbled, snatching the case and tossing it into the stream. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>' shoulders sagged further and she pulled her knees up into her chest, and sneered at him like a petulant teenager. <br /> <br /> &quot;You are going to be working with me. And you'll do it with a clear head.&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;Well I think you'll have a very hard time forcing me out of it whilst I am safely tucked away. Black doesn't give a damn what I do, and I have suppliers willing to send me whatever I need.&quot; She crossed her arms defiantly and stuck her chin out at him. <br /> <br /> &quot;You will have a very hard time getting your&hellip;stuff where I am taking you. Get up,&quot; he snapped. <br /> <br /> &quot;If I have to side along with you we'll probably splinch,&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> objected. &quot;I'm exhausted. Can't we take that bus or something?&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;I'm afraid not, Ms Mezarci. But if you can sit still for a few moments I believe I can find you an alternative.&quot; <br /> <br /> She grabbed the bottom of his robes to stop him. &quot;Wait.&quot;<br /> <br /> <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> looked deeply unsettled as Severus sat next to her on the rocks again. Surrendering his cloak to keep her from freezing to death, they were perfectly still for just a moment watching the shadows of trees just beyond the pebbly stream bank sway with the summer wind. <br /> <br /> He had no idea what she was about to say, but she'd sucked her lower lip between her teeth and was chewing furiously on it while she thought, it had begun to bleed again.</p>  &quot;I need to hear something from you. So I don't forget just what we're into. I need you to tell me the worst thing, or at least the one you'd think&hellip;I would think was the worst, the Dark Lord has ever done?&quot; <br /> <br /> That question made his innards squirm frantically, Albus had likely not anticipated this. He had no idea what Voldemort had promised her in that brief moment where she was held, but the fact that she had to ask for a reminder, a warning, was disturbing. Severus turned, peering into the woods to see if anyone was present before leaning in very close to speak to Lourdes in the quiet, rapt voice he used at the start of each year. <br /> <br /> &quot;Before he became the Dark Lord, he impressed himself inside a diary. A book that could think for itself, and reply to whoever was writing in it. This book was slipped in, by Malfoy, to the school things of an eleven year old girl, the only one in a family of too many. The little girl had talked to the diary all year, at first the memory was her friend. It was always there for her, it wanted to know what her hopes and desires were, and because she was lonely she poured her heart out and told it all her secrets. The memory fed on her soul, her secrets and fears, and then her life. She was rewarded with terror, nights deprived of sleep, and opening the school's Chamber of Secrets. That little girl was possessed by the Dark Lord. She was promised companionship, and she received nothing.&quot; <br /> <br /> <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> shuddered when he said that, and Severus was not sure if it was because his lips had bumped her ear, or because of what he had just said. &quot;All that seems worse than mere murder.&quot; <br /> <br /> &quot;It's a pattern of his I see,&quot; she said hoarsely. &quot;A memory, did all that?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So it would seem,&quot; he replied. &quot;He will promise you everything now, swear to deliver the objects of your deepest desire, assure you that you are special, and rare. But in the end you are nothing more than a servant, whose magic is useful.&quot; Severus added quietly, picking up a crushed drink can from the debris on the bank. <br /> <br /> The tale seemed to have the desired effect on her. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> was staring out over the water with narrowed eyes and a tense frown as though she were making dire calculations of risk. Though, all in all she'd done very well this evening. Even Severus had to admit that. <br /> <br /> &quot;Portus&hellip;&quot; The can glowed blue for a moment before he dropped it at <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>' feet. <br /> <br /> &quot;Take that portkey. When you arrive, do not make a sound, do not leave, and do not touch anything. I'll be in with you shortly.&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> apparently realizing there wasn't much of a choice for her, wrinkled her nose in distaste before finally picking up the can, and vanishing within the little nova of blue light. </meta></meta></meta></lj-cut>"

 <span style=""""><span style=""""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span><span style=""""><span style="""">Severus Snape was not the happiest of men at the moment. As he sat in the Headmaster&#39;s office watching Dumbledore pace behind the desk, Severus busied himself by picking the stubby evergreen needles and purple blossoms out of his hair. Earlier, during his run through the <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:placename w:st=""on"">Forbidden</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st=""on"">Forest</st1:placetype></st1:place>, he&rsquo;d been spotted by a herd of angry Centaurs and had to take cover in a stand of flowering evergreen shrubs, which left him itchy, sticky and more irritable than usual. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />The Dark Lord had called him again that evening, just to see how fast Severus would come when called - this time. No one had said anything particularly useful at the meeting, either. Instead he&rsquo;d stood through forty five minutes of Lucius Malfoy detailing everything he&rsquo;d done for the Dark Lord since his rebirth (which ranged from tossing sacks of gold at the Ministry to preparing the Dark Lord&#39;s safe house with the finest appointments). <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
 <br />Considering the circumstances, Severus&rsquo; reintegration with the Death Eaters had gone rather smoothly - at first. The moment Dumbledore gave the word on the night of the Dark Lord&#39;s rebirth, Severus went through the forest like a shot towards the Apparition boundary, not knowing whether he would even live through the night. It was a slim chance that the Dark Lord would take his apologies into consideration - you came when you were called, not when it was convenient. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />Or so he had thought. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />Projecting more confidence than he&rsquo;d ever thought possible, and concealing every trace of fear so completely that he nearly believed his own lie, Severus groveled at the Dark Lord&#39;s feet and spilled a well constructed apology. Two hours, it had only been two hours, and because of that small delay he could remain in his position at Hogwarts. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />Now Severus had information for him, fifteen years&#39; worth. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br style="""" />
 <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style="""" />
 <!--!--[if--><!--!--[if--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style="""">At later meetings, Severus began laying the groundwork for his own downfall, starting with excuses for his oblivious behavior when the Dark Lord had been right under his nose and apologies for having doubted his power. Despite testimony from other Death Eaters that Severus had stayed the course during his time at Hogwarts, he was being watched far too closely. Even with the evidence in his favor, all those years under Albus Dumbledore&#39;s wing made Severus as much a figure of much suspicion as he was a potentially valuable informant. Then there was the little matter of the incomplete prophecy that had played a large part in the Dark Lord&rsquo;s demise&hellip; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <!--!--!--[if----><!--!--[endif]----><br />
 <!--!--!--[endif]------>Dumbledore was playing with fire this time. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>He&rsquo;d sent Severus off to tell the Dark Lord that the prophecy he&rsquo;d delivered all those years ago was incomplete, and that he&rsquo;d only just discovered there was more to it. Albus was hoping to scatter the Dark Lord&rsquo;s forces, drawing them out in the open by convincing them to make attacks on the Ministry headquarters where the prophecies were housed. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></span><br style="""" />{C}<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style="""" />
 <!--!--[if--><!--!--[if-->{C}<!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style="""">Naturally, the Dark Lord took the bait; but when Severus reluctantly delivered the revelation about the prophecy, he dropped in favor just as quickly as he&rsquo;d been taken back into the fold. Now, compared to Lucius&rsquo; grand gestures and the absolutely over-the-top toadying of several other Death Eaters, fifteen years of Slytherin favoritism and reports on the niggling details of Albus Dumbledore&rsquo;s personal life did not seem so impressive. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <!--!--!--[if----><!--!--[endif]----><br />
 <!--!--!--[endif]------>Severus needed to make a gesture, or deliver a token of some sort to cement the Dark Lord&#39;s trust. With the sheer number of betrayals and disappointments, the Death Eaters had all started on a more or less even playing field, and they were all taking advantage of this new-found opportunity. Severus would have to move quickly and give the Dark Lord a reason to take him back into a closer circle. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
 <br />For all the frantic suggestions, from faux Hesperide apple seeds to some exotic Dark creature, not a single member of the Order could find something that might do. Not when what the Dark Lord really wanted right now was the full content of the prophecy, Potter&#39;s head on a platter, and more followers - stronger, smarter followers than he&rsquo;d had last time. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />Mad-Eye Moody and Sirius Black had taken that last idea and run with it, pushing to insert a second operative, to strike while the iron was hot. Black himself had volunteered, but even Moody had to agree that someone who had just spent thirteen years in prison was not exactly prepared to plunge into the Dark Lord&rsquo;s service. Dumbledore approved of the general idea, but had to point out that there was no one present who could make a convincing entrance and also lie effectively. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br style="""" />{C}<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style="""" />
 <!--!--[if--><!--!--[if-->{C}<!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style="""">Severus always stiffened and scowled when the suggestion was made. Another operative was a sensible proposition, and surely Dumbledore did not indulge the idea to spite him. He probably thought it would be helpful, but Severus could never quite get over the feeling that he wasn&rsquo;t being completely trusted&hellip; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br style="""" />

 <!--!--!--[if----><!--!--[endif]----><br />
 <!--!--!--[endif]------>Severus plucked a small, battered gray moth from a lock of hair on the side of his head, and held it up. As Dumbledore watched the moth flap its wings furiously to attempt an escape, a curious expression came over his face, as if someone had just been kind enough to turn on a light for him. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style=""""><span style=""""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>

 <br />A deadly still haze of heat hung over Istanbul that night, diffusing the neon lights and lending to the dreamy atmosphere of mingled antique tile and cold concrete in the city&#39;s sprawling Grand Bazaar. On this particular evening, the place to be, if you were in the know, was the Sahaflar Carsisi -the Old Book Bazaar. Its sturdy gray slab walls sheltered some thirty shops and booths arranged around a courtyard with a massive tree at its heart. Tonight the used paperback hawkers had been replaced with the catering staff and wealthy oafs who had more money than taste.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>One after another, beautiful leather-bound volumes and carefully preserved scrolls and manuscripts had gone up on the block at the annual &ldquo;Occult and Oddities&rdquo; auction.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The evening&#39;s second to last item for bid was still wrapped in chamois, and the arms of Lourdes Mezarci.</p>

Despite the damp and the heat of the evening she was dressed in the all engulfing gray layers of the old fashioned gomlek and entari coat, with a hairstyle of tiny black braids twisted into a large knot at the base of her neck.</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style=""""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span><span style=""""><span style="""">It would be difficult to believe the wealthy bibliophiles were duped by her spectacularly poor attempt at passing for normal. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>But those desperate for a rare first edition didn&rsquo;t question the personality or appearance of someone who can give them what they want. <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> was tall for a woman and gaunt, with the hallmarks of central Asian nomad ancestry - a long straight nose, light brown skin, and prominent cheekbones. One got the impression that she had once been attractive in a sharp, wintry way. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>But now her face was half-hidden behind a swath of dark fringe, meant to obscure a web of scars on her left cheek, leaving only one of her narrow murky green eyes and the black script tattoo underneath it visible. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></span><br style="""" />{C}<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style="""" />

 <!--!--!--[if----><!--!--[endif]----><br />
 <!--!--!--[endif]------>The client, some business type whose name she could never remember, looked momentarily offended by her sneering, but was wise enough not to act on it. While most of her customers weren&#39;t particularly fond of her on a social level, they were usually more than willing to put up with her exorbitant prices and brusque manner. For good reason, of course; in her two years brokering books for clients whose interests ranged towards the occult and the bizarre, <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> had never once failed to deliver. Her refusal to socialize, and her decidedly foreign appearance had accidentally granted her a reputation as fashionably &ldquo;<i style="""">h&uuml;z&uuml;n&rdquo; &ndash;</i> a very Turkish concept of melancholy &ndash; which actually did more for sales in <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Istanbul</st1:place></st1:city> than being cheerful and efficient would have.</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <br />
 <span style=""""><span style="""">Of course, her clients had no idea their &lsquo;<i style="""">h&uuml;z&uuml;n&rsquo;</i> book dealer had a slightly more interesting than average history - and a rather good hand for forgery&hellip;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;SOLD!&rdquo; the auctioneer cried, ending her reverie and the bidding on an unremarkable book of local herbs. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span><br />
 <br />&rdquo;That thing isn&rsquo;t even two centuries old,&rdquo; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> muttered to one of the cats who purred and rubbed its cheek against her free hand. It wasn&#39;t just the forced socialization that was irritating her. For the past few days, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> was aware that she was being followed - hunted, even. She hadn&#39;t been home for a week in an effort to throw whoever was following her off the scent.&nbsp;<br />
 <br />In fact earlier that evening, while she was having her pre-auction tea and smoke, she&rsquo;d caught a glimpse here and there of richly patterned waistcoat, a velvet jacket too heavy for the heat, and a beard too long and too white to belong to any Muggle tourist or local. They only served to confirm her suspicion as to the identity of her stalker, and if it was who she suspected, she was in no mood to deal with him&hellip;<br />
 <br />As <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> closed her eyes briefly, to enjoy the last dizzying drag of the cigarette, she caught the familiar soft *pop* of the skillful apparator , and rustling sound of velvet approaching on her left side. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>A cat that had been lounging near her feet leapt to attention and hissed like a Halloween decoration when the outline of a man appeared out of thin air, and she leapt up as well.<br />
 <br />&quot;<st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>! How very serendipitous that we should run in to one another like this,&quot; said a familiar voice, like water over rocks. A hand came down on her shoulder like a bear trap snapping around the leg of an animal. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&quot;Albus,&quot; she murmured, eyes darting around the crowd automatically, searching for the fastest escape route. &quot;Here for the auction?&quot; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&quot;As striking as some of this evening&#39;s goods are,&quot; Dumbledore said cheerfully, &quot;I must confess I haven&#39;t come for an evening of excitement and manuscripts. I wonder if I might have a moment alone with you.&quot; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&quot;Why don&#39;t we go to a caf&eacute; elsewhere? This isn&#39;t the best place.&quot;<br />
 <br />-***-<br />
 <br />Lourdes had only taken a moment to hand her bundle off to the auctioneer&rsquo;s assistant before she led him out of the bazaar at a rapid clip. After following her through a dizzy maze of crooked streets and sinking, tilted buildings, Albus found himself near the city&#39;s most famous Mosque.<br />
 <br />When he paused to admire the effect of the domes and minarets against the night sky, <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> drew a filmy gray scarf out of her pocket and draped it around her head as if she were entering a holy place.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>From there he followed her into a tiny building, down a flight of slippery stairs, and into a magnificent underground cistern that resembled a basilica with hundreds of columns half immersed in water supporting the vast roof. Carp swam under the suspended walkways, among copper coins thrown by tourists.<br />
 <br />Albus recognized this as the transitory space between Muggle Istanbul and the Wizarding community, hidden underground in the old tunnels. <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> seemed to be doing her best not to be spotted by anyone, and Albus discovered why very quickly. While the Muggles had all left by closing time, witches and wizards, cloaked in burnooses and old fashioned clothes, paused to glare, point, and hiss to one another as they moved between this world and the one above.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style=""""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span><span style=""""><span style="""">She took him to the very back corner of the cistern, where a green column with a Medusa head for a base rose out of a pool of water so dark it seemed bottomless.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Several stone slabs floated on the surface like lily pads paving the way to the shadowy gap between column and wall.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>As they crossed, the stones seemed to register their &ldquo;right&rdquo; to enter, and did not sink an inch. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style="""">&ldquo;There was a huge fuss when the cistern was converted into a tourist area but they&#39;ve worked everything out now.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>If the Muggles manage to find it by accident, the paving flips and dumps them out in the main waterway by one of the sister columns,&rdquo; Lourdes confided as they slipped into the dark gap at the end of the path and re-emerged in a tunnel covered in decorative mosaics, lit with innumerable, brilliantly colored glass lamps hanging from chains. The color of the lamp glass changed from golden, orange and white to eerie green and blue as they wove through the tunnels, clattering across one wrought iron canal bridge after another. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />After passing what must have been the <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Istanbul</st1:city></st1:place> equivalent of Knockturn Alley, they took one last left turn into a dank, litter strewn tunnel lit with murky red lamps which hadn&rsquo;t been cleaned in ages. There was a lone red door without a knob or handle at the very end, and the battered wooden sign hanging above.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The banner atop the poppy-crowned skull emblem identified the establishment as &quot;O! Morphos.&quot; <span style="""">&nbsp;<br />
 <br />&quot;And where are we now, Lourdes?&quot; Albus asked her.<br />
 <br />&quot;Just a cafe.&nbsp; Like I said,&quot; she replied calmly.</span><br />
 <!--/span--><!--/span--><br />
 <!--!--/span---->When <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> rapped on the door three times, the heavy iron viewing slit slid open with a bang. Shifty looking eyes and an illuminated wand tip scrutinized the two visitors before the door slid in to the wall, opening to a series of rotting curtains which <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> pushed aside to reveal a miasmic interior, thick with swirling, spicy blue smoke. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />As his eyes adjusted to the light, Albus could see that the room appeared to be lit and populated by dingy Chinese lanterns.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Each big enough for at least two people, hanging from the ceiling like cocoons and settled on the ground in clusters to make the most of the fairly small space.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Waitresses and pipe tenders scurried down the narrow paths, ascending to the upper tiers on heavy silk cords. The inhabited cubicles were silhouette plays of people speaking in low voices, the smoke shadows rolling out of their mouths and pipes. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style="""">As <st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city> removed her headscarf, the shifty-eyed proprietress emerged from behind another set of drapes to greet <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> in Turkish, lavishing her with a kiss on each cheek as if she were a long lost daughter.</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style="""">&quot;Coffee or tea?&quot; Lourdes asked him coolly. &ldquo;Or they have nepenthe if you fancy doing a bit of forgetting&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br />
 <!--/span--><br />
 <!--!--/span---->&quot;I&#39;ll take tea, please.&quot; Albus watched the proprietress give him one last sidelong look, as if she couldn&rsquo;t decide whether he was trustworthy, before she vanished again. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span><br />
 <br />Lourdes navigated the the maze of lanterns and located a suitable one.&nbsp; Holding up a finger to ask for patience, <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> took hold of a cord suspended from the ceiling and stepped onto the little platform threaded to the base. With one firm tug the cord took her up like a lift, allowing <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> to step neatly into a cubicle before sending it down for him. Albus followed suit, as spryly as he could to discover that the insides of the lantern-cubicles were padded all around with cushions, with a small table in the center. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />Settled in on her side, <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> looked strangely ill in the yellow light as she flashed a smile, like a glint of knife in the dark. &ldquo;Will you let me read for you?&rdquo; She raised an eyebrow and held up a battered set of fortune teller&#39;s cards tied together with a short length of ribbon. It was less of an inquiry and more of a challenge, as she knew how little store he set in Divination. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he replied serenely, rubbing his fingers over the worn surface of the cards. This set was old, with the elaborate decorations and crowded medieval illustrations of a Visconti deck, and had no doubt seen quite a few owners before being consigned to <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>&rsquo; pocket. He suspected they&rsquo;d belonged to one of her many &lsquo;aunties,&rsquo; as her father had been something of a traveling mortician, and her mother a dancer. <span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;You know, I got so much better at this once the Ministry sent me off to university for psychology. Taught me all about facial expressions and body language; you wouldn&rsquo;t believe how much information people give you without even realizing it. It&rsquo;s much more effective than anything that old bat at Hogwarts taught us about the great mystical beyond inspiring the cards. You know about the program, don&rsquo;t you? Sending off Squibs and social undesirables to Muggle universities and training camps so we could be&hellip;useful?&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said archly as Albus cut the deck in two. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about that; I also heard a great many good things about the work you did for the experimental division. Behavioral Analysis, was it? And you were second in command, with a reputation for bravery I hear? <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />She laughed, but it was harsh, not a happy sound at all. &ldquo;The rumors people spread these days... I was in line for command of the whole department. You know what they say: the best hunters have a bit of the beast in them. Apparently they thought I had a little too much beast, though they certainly didn&rsquo;t shy away from using it when it suited them. I didn&rsquo;t even get a trial&hellip;&rdquo; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;It also seems that the Turkish Ministry does not stand behind its agents as firmly as it should,&rdquo; he replied, as he pinched two halves of the deck, watching the cards arc up through the air and shuffle together. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;Would you have, Albus?&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> fixed him with a cold, imperious look. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;I would have never pushed you in the first place,&rdquo; he said simply. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;And yet I have the strangest feeling that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve come down here to do,&rdquo; she hissed, reaching up to run a finger over the tattoo under her eye. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather hard to get a job with these marks, you know; nobody&rsquo;s had this script in well over a hundred years, but people still manage to understand it.&rdquo; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;And you were unable to work for the Muggle police?&rdquo; Albus asked, pausing to put the deck down on the table as he fiddled discreetly with his wand. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Dangerous Citizen and an ex-convict. I&rsquo;d be lucky to get work scrubbing toilets as it is. I know <i style="""">you</i>, &rdquo; she said particularly scornfully, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t take politics into account, and believe me when I say I&rsquo;d rather forget the whole rotten business, but the current Assembly and Cabinet are averse to people like me at the moment. Every time I attempt to work for the Muggles, the Ministry slaps me with the Statute of Secrecy, and there&rsquo;s absolutely no getting me back into the department. I know who&rsquo;s behind it, but there&rsquo;s no remedying it. So I&rsquo;ve been dealing books.&rdquo; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;By &#39;dealing&#39; I assume you mean passing forgeries on to Muggles?&rdquo; he said shrewdly; if he knew <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>, she was keeping the originals. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t want to violate the Statute, you understand, and its good money. But I don&rsquo;t think I can do it forever,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> sighed as he slid the cards towards her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit late for you to be down here looking after my career, mind getting to the point?&rdquo; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;Let us see if you can discern my motive with your delightful cards.&rdquo; Albus smiled serenely as the petite waitress tumbled through the drapes, directing a heavy tea service and a hookah-like pipe to the table.<br />
 <br />As Albus poured tea, Lourdes clamped her teeth down on her lower lip and laid down two cards before she caught on to his trick. &ldquo;Very clever,&rdquo; she spat, slapping the deck down. &ldquo;I forgot you used to teach Transfiguration...&rdquo; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />She held up the Judgment card he&rsquo;d changed to bear the image of a <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Phoenix</st1:city></st1:place> between two fingers and raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;I&lsquo;ve already repaid my life debt, Albus.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Did you get the note I sent along?&rdquo;<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Yes, actually. Though I must admit I had rather a hard time finding it amusing.&rdquo; The last time she&#39;d worked for the Order, she&rsquo;d made it clear that her interest in assisting extended no further than fulfilling her life debt.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>On that occasion he&rsquo;d only had to send a letter reminding her of what she owed. Though two heads in a box, her proof of a job well done, wasn&#39;t the response he&#39;d expected, it had certainly made her point. This time the request was delicate enough to require an appointment in person - the Order could not afford to fail again. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;Pity, I thought you&rsquo;d get a kick out of it. Your lot seem to have had a real thing for severed heads in magic in the bad old days. Wreathes of freshly claimed enemy heads on the necks of horses, skull cups for libations, burying your leaders&#39; severed heads outside your major cities? Charming, really,&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> muttered. Her hand hovered over the second card while she examined it closely.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; skull and snake, but I thought&hellip;&rdquo; She tapped a card that now bore the Dark Mark with a finger and gave him a wary look. &ldquo;I thought he was dead?&rdquo; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;Many wizards still think so, but I have reliable first hand accounts that Voldemort has reacquired a corporeal form,&rdquo; Albus replied gravely. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;How very tricky of him,&rdquo; she said slowly, as if she were still trying to digest that concept. &ldquo;When do you suppose that happened?&rdquo;<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Three weeks ago, during the Tri-Wizard tournament&rsquo;s last task at Hogwarts. If, after what I have to say, you still require payment, I will see about finding a suitable token. More importantly, I offer you the chance to change the public&#39;s mind about the nature of&hellip;people like you.&quot; He faltered on those last few words because he had not quite meant for them to come out like that. But their damage had already been done; he saw a little spark in her eye as she put on a predatory smile. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;People like me? Albus, you&#39;ve lost your touch; I&#39;m disappointed,&quot; she said, shaking an admonishing finger at him. &quot;What sort of person, or should I say which aspect of my person are you referring to? Because there are so many things about me that are socially unacceptable. But to be honest, I&#39;ve got nothing better to do,&quot; <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> sighed, her sharp smile fading as she stared into her tea glass, &quot;so, I&#39;ll hear you out.&quot; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&quot;How are your Occlumency skills now?&quot; Albus asked. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&quot;Worse than my Legilimency, but good enough that you probably shouldn&#39;t trust <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">me.</st1:place></st1:state>&quot; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&quot;Then it seems I will need to give you a reason to trust me.&quot; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />-***-<br />
 <br />His forced expression of serenity couldn&#39;t cover up the smell she&#39;d become well acquainted with. If <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> knew anything, it was desperation; and he reeked of it. There must be something powerfully important going on if Albus Dumbledore was going to all this trouble. He wasn&#39;t the sort of person to waste time, yet here he&#39;d spent the past week hunting her down.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>If it was to do with Voldemort, Albus must have run out of ideas if he wanted to involve her directly in his little society; most normal wizards fighting something evil seldom wanted to do so alongside someone like her.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was a blessed few people who could see her for who she was, and not what. Even stranger was the fact that he had resorted to grasping at straws with appeals to her long-vanished sense of social vanity and sentimentality when he ought to know better.</p>

She&#39;d made that decision in her second year of school when she received the news that her entire family had been wiped out, caught up in a cross fire while traveling through <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Cyprus</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After their deaths she&rsquo;d gone out looking for a job, rather than submit to the care of strangers in an orphanage, and by force of sheer luck found another family. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>The Hog&#39;s Head was home after they died, and Aberforth was everything, though there was no blood between them.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>But <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> had spoiled everything with a single spell, and in the heat of panic Aberforth had allowed Albus to take her. </span></span></p>

 <span style=""""><span style=""""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span><span style=""""><span style="""">Not much could have been done for her, certainly not at St Mungo&rsquo;s where a wound of that nature would have taken ages to stabilize, and she would have most certainly been arrested.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Albus had put the wound in stasis and was willing to let her go free, back to <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Turkey</st1:country-region></st1:place>, on the condition that she would not give herself away. If she wanted to live, he said quietly while she writhed on the sofa, her own blood drying on her hands, she had to make the Stygian Oath.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Bind herself to silence or lose her life.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It was for her own safety, Albus insisted - <i style="""">you know so little about what is out there waiting to take you</i>. <span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

 <!--!--[if--><!--!--[if--><!--[endif]--></span></span><span style=""""><span style="""">But the word from Albus hadn&rsquo;t come in all those years. </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style="""">Despite her best efforts over the years to root out painful but pleasant memories and longings, a few of the heartier ones had remained buried in her heart like persistent termites. One or two of them were gnawing away at her right then, urging her to make the most of this. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style="""">&quot;And how is my Aberforth?&quot; she asked softly, shuffling her cards into a neat pile so Albus could set them right. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <!--!--!--[if----><!--!--[endif]----><br />
 <!--!--!--[endif]------>&quot;Well enough, I&rsquo;m told. Not quite the same since you left, obviously. He lost one of the <st1:place w:st=""on"">Kashmir</st1:place> nanny goats a month ago as well,&quot; Albus replied, pouring himself another cup of tea. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;I miss him&hellip;&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> said slowly. She felt eighteen years old and angry every time she thought about missing them - her family, Aberforth, everyone. She had to take a deep draught of tea to wash down the sour feeling of resentment trying to creep up her throat before she managed to croak, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a rather lonely life here, you know.&rdquo; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;I know, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>, you said as much in each of your letters. I think, though, that you will understand the danger you might have faced then once you&rsquo;ve had a chance to look over the accounts of the first war. I would not have come this far to speak to you unless I thought you capable of what I&rsquo;d like to ask.&rdquo; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />While the rest of him remained as poised and collected as always, his voice -- and for just a moment there, his eyes -- betrayed the amount of strain he was under. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
 <br />
 <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> felt her chest tighten and her heart skipped a beat at the sight, and she felt uncomfortably young for the second time that day. It was deeply unsettling to see him starting to show his age after always presenting such a vibrant, powerful presence. Her eyelids fluttered wildly and she lost her hard expression as she reached for the burner under the large pipe on the table. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />&quot;How exactly am I to assist you this time?&quot; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> turned her focus back on Albus, whose eyes never left her hands as she fiddled with the pipe dials. &ldquo;Are you looking for me to profile for you, or do you want me to go after stray Death Eaters again?&rdquo; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <br />Taking a deep pull of blue smoke, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place> closed her eyes and waited for his response, enjoying the familiar sensation of her mind drifting just a bit out of synchronization with her body. Voldemort had so very little to do with her; he was no more than newspaper clippings and tragic stories.<br style="""" />

 <!--!--[if--><!--!--[if--><!--[endif]--><span style=""""><span style="""">&quot;I know you have said you no longer hunt heads, but there is one we are in need of.&quot; He eyed the black leather band with the blue eye talisman on her wrist as he spoke, as if he suspected what it contained. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><br />
 <!--!--!--[if----><!--!--[endif]----><br />
 <!--!--!--[endif]------>&ldquo;Well then Albus, I&rsquo;m sure that can be arranged. And what will you give me in return?&rdquo; she asked, unable to keep the predatory growl out of her voice. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
 <br />&ldquo;Very nearly anything,&rdquo; he began.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Let me go home, break the oath,&rdquo; she interrupted. It was the thought of somewhere safe that set her off and left her unable to control the manic edge in her voice. &ldquo;Break it now, break it right now and I&rsquo;ll do anything.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />&ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo; Albus asked evenly.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""""><span style="""">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I have left&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
 <!--/span--><!--/span--><br />
 <!--!--/span---->There was a moment of silence while he watched her, and she held her breath as if somehow it would help the outcome&hellip;<br />
 <br />&ldquo;You must let me explain to him first, and when that is done you&rsquo;ll have free reign for letters. Two weeks at the very most is all it will take. Will you accept this?&rdquo;<br />
 <br />She nodded, still not willing to exhale until she was absolutely sure the oath was undone.<br />
 <br />&ldquo;Give me your hand, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Lourdes</st1:city></st1:place>.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />She dropped the mouthpiece of her pipe in an instant, and held her left hand over the table as if waiting for Albus to place a ring on it.<br />
 <br />With one fluid sweep of his wand over the back of her hand, he exposed the lingering magic left by the Stygian oath &ndash; an electric orange ribbon of light wound in a crackling figure of eight around her hand and wrist. As he whispered the dissolving charm, the light wavered, popped and split as a strand broke off and unwound into the air, fizzing madly as Lourdes heard the echo of her voice making the promise - <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><i style="""">May heaven above and earth below be my witnesses&hellip; <span style="""">&nbsp;</span><span style="""">&nbsp;</span></i></span></span><br />
 <br />
 <!--/i-->When it was gone, the last of the magic evaporated, she clapped her hand over her heart and fell back into the cushions, feeling a thousand times lighter and freer in a span of seconds. &ldquo;Now, what do you want?&rdquo; she asked smoothly, doing her best to contain a sudden burst of giddy, childish hope, which was wildly enhanced by the deep pull she&rsquo;d taken on her pipe.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Blue smoke curled out of the corners of her mouth as she exhaled the last of the baited breath and for a moment spiraled into a wonderfully drowsy feeling of infinite patience.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Soon, very soon, she was going to see her Aberforth again.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>And it was going to be as safe and warm as summer evenings in the meadow, knitting while the goats grazed. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span></p>

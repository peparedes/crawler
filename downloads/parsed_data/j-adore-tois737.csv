This is the first time I've even looked at my journal in what seems like YEARS. Sorry journal. Not that anyone is reading this stupid thing anyways. Lots of stuff has happened in the past few months. I graduated, and all that jazz...and I can't really remember what else because it's like two o'clock in the morning. so I'll return later and fill you all in on the juicy details of my life...

I'm at Stephanie's house with the girls, and it's a grand old time. The last time we'll be able to hang out before we all leave for school sob. Mmmk...night."

"event","Don't you hate it when things get awkward between you and your friends? I have this friend (who shall remain nameless), and I try so hard to make things work...but every time I hang out with her, it just seems like I'm forcing myself to be someone I'm not. i.e. her friend.

We've had great times, don't get me wrong. But now...It just seems like we're growing apart. Or at least I'm growing away from her, as she stays in the same place, not noticing that everyone else around her leaves.

I hate pretending. I hate feeling like this. I hate this whole situation.

Which is why, I'm typing this on her computer as she watches the third Harry Potter movie, with 2 other people, and they eat chocolate covered popcorn.

What's wrong with me? Is college going to make this situation better or worse?"

They take my kindness for weakness
They take my silence for speechless
They consider my uniqueness strange
They call my language slang
They see my confidence as conceit
They see my mistakes as defeat
They consider my success accidental
They minimize my intelligence to ""potential""
My questions mean I'm unaware
My advancement is somehow unfair
Any praise is preferential treatment
To voice concern is discontentment
If I stand up for myself, I'm too defensive
If I don't trust them, I'm too apprehensive
I'm deviant if I separate
I'm fake if I assimilate
My character is constantly under attack

Me (to Shawnee): Malleri just licked your ass...

*me, caylyn and josh laugh*
Me: Your belly button smells like ass...therefore your belly button ring smells like ass. And you just gave Malleri the ball from your ring to put on her tounge ring. So her tounge was on your Ass by default.
Malleri (turns to Shawnee): It was good for me, how about you?

"event","SOOO now that we're back in school, life is back to normal. Whatever normal was in the first place. I don't know why people always say that their high school years are some of the best they've ever had. I hate it. I hate Bird with a passion. But, i only have less than 6 months left...and then another four years (at least) of school. YIPPEE!

As if life wasn't getting any better...Prom is just around the corner. le sigh x2 And the pressure is on. There are already people around me talking about, and planning for the ""big dance"". you'd figure that I'd be more excited about it since it <I>is</I> the only dance I'll be allowed to go to in my whole teenage life. If not life in general...(but once i'm 18 i'll be free to make my own choices. yay) So all the people in the ""group"" i.e. all the girls/guys i hang out with on a day to day basis who have significant others are on freaking hormonal overtime! <STRIKE>I mean as if they couldn't keep their hands off each other before, now that talk of prom is in the air, they really can't hold back.</STRIKE> I'm sorry...that sounded a bit too bitter. I'm supposed to be the happy-go-lucky one in the group.(oh joy)

i hate how people have preconceived notions about you, before they even take the time to know you. I won't list any names...because the majority of the people (if not all of the people) that read my journal go to my school. So Caylyn...said that this girl that we were supposed to be hanging out with didn't think we (me and the girl) ""clicked"". sigh. And she also told me that I intimidated her. HAH me? intimidating anyone? that's a laugh. So...now we're all buddy buddy (me and the girl). and then Caylyn says that she thinks she's losing me as a friend. And that lately i've seemed like I was too cool to hang out with her. Again. HAH. as if i'm too cool, it would definately be the other way around. But we straightened everything away. Thank God, because I definately don't have enough drama in my life as it is with applying to colleges and what not (sarcasm for those who have followed this far.)


Um...I've made this aggreement with myself (sounds a bit strange i know. just work with me here) that I'm not going to like any boys in high school. Not that i'm going to turn lesbo and start liking girls...b/c that is never an option (for me at least). But yea. I've been...screwed with? I guess. too many times to try again. High school boys are not worth it. Or maybe i should say, boys during high school is not worth it. I think i'm going to focus as much as i can on school so i can get out of Virginia ASAP. O yeah. for those who don't know...I hate it here (in virginia) I want more than anything (besides...you know, a mustang) to go to New York. I may be a southern girl by birth, but i'm a New York-ian(<B>EDIT:</B> New York-er) at heart. 


mmk. for those that actually read all this. Gold star for you. I'm not even sure I would've read all this...and i wrote it. So for now...(and i'm stealing this from what i hope is a dear friend) ""Goodbye, Goodnight, Farewell"" (and i seriously hope i didn't screw up the order...b/c he might just beat me up. lol. jay kay)

My wheel had been making all these sqeaking noises for some time now...and another mechanic was like...""it's nothing to be concerned about"". well...the squeaking got louder, and turned into loud pops, and all of a sudden, my wheel won't move. and i'm like seriously freaking out. and I'm sitting in my car at the top of my street crying, becuase I almost made it home, and then my car broke. 


THANK YOU GOD!


George (the good mechanic dude) came and rescued me, and fixed it so I could get to my driveway and pull in, and he's going to come by tomorrow and fix it.

"event","oh man...

The cast party for <U>Up The Down Staircase</U> was CRAZY. Let's just say there was A LOT of kissing going on. haha. And let's also say that I don't have VL's anymore <grin> I'm not one to kiss and tell, so I can't say who it was...and if it was a boy. lol. jay kay. Although that did happen to a couple of people. It was a crazy game of Dare or Dare...and spin the knife. haha. 

What made me sad though, was that the one person that I did want to kiss, had a girlfriend...and I didn't know that. I'd been flirting w/ him for the whole play. (so that's like what? 3 or 4 weeks) and he was flirting back. But he wouldn't play spin the knife...which is good. I can't fault him for being a good boyfriend, even though I REALLY wanted to kiss him. haha.

The boy I lost my VL's to, lol. he stopped the knife on him. He made sure it hit him, it was soo cute. I laughed really hard.

I can not wait for the one acts, because those are just as crazy. And now I miss the play...I don't have anything to do after school, and that makes me sad. 

I also had to belly dance on a chair for 30 seconds...and I was going to make the boy I kissed (who shall never be named...unless it's jamila who asks) dance with me, and he was going to...but they made us get off the chairs. (We were at Ledo Pizza)."

"event","I am such a masochist(<I>masochist</I> n : someone who obtains pleasure from receiving punishment)...I must be, becuase there are no other explanations. I was going through Livejournal...randomly (yea right), and I come across journal entries for ""he who shall not be named"", and let's just say that once again, I'm just a tad incensed about quite a many of things. And I'm working on it...but I don't think I'll ever be done ""working on it"" until BPP asks me out....or someone else. sigh.

so yeah. moving on. 

The play is awesome!!! you should all come see it, and mary, if your reading this bring BPP (pretty pants...), b/c I really want to see him. : D Caylyn and I are rocking out so hard on this thing, I am going to Broadway, and get out of Bumpkinville, USA (chesterfield). As soon as I can, I'm gone. Not enough good memories to keep me here. I don't know why, but I don't feel the need to stick around for anything. I mean, yes I have family here...but what are they good for? The only good ones are my mom and my sister, and they can come with me for all I care. The rest just suck at life, and are only good for hurting others (mainly me). Sure, I may have some friends here...but no one that I wouldn't just bring along. (tiff, jammy, kris, mary, cay, amelia)

Speaking of Amelia...she moved! ::cries:: she's in North Carolina right now, and we're all so sad. I keep expecting to see her at school, or in class, but I don't, and it's really depressing. She said that she'd come back for our cast party (which is in Nov.), and go with us to NY (in the spring), but that's not enough. I want my amelia! Micheal, poor Micheal. The kid is heartbroken. I've never seen him look so sad in my life. :-( they were really in love, like no lie. And they were the cutest couple. But at least she got Homecoming Queen before she left. At least that's something she can take to her new school. Amelia did what Caylyn, Jamila, and I only wish we could do. She got out. I feel like Virginia is a disease. I can only think of all the bad things that have happened here that make me want to leave even more. And the bad things that have happened elsewhere (Dallas). sob.

I'm making up for lost time in journal entries. It's definately been a couple of weeks. 

I got a car.

for those who don't know...which isn't very many...if anyone. :-(

I've found out that I am absolutely addicted to grilled cheese sandwiches. :-X i feel really bad that I am. Not even something normal like....ice cream. (which I am addicted to also...go figure.)

Caylyn and I have determined that <B>Choke</B> is the new everything word. I mean, it's so great. 
i.e 

Dude, you are so choke (<I>Translation:</I> Dude you are so hot)

or

stop being such a tricky choke choke (<I>Translation:</I> stop being such a tricky ass bitch)

see...it's great


I'm grounded from the internet until report cards come out...so the rest of my entries will be few and far between. I might sneak on every now and then to comment or catch up on the lives of all my peeps...but for the next few weeks, i'll be nothing more than a memory. A shadow on the wall...

Wow. I'm a wall shadow. how deep and profound is that? It's like...choke.


:-D Briana and Julia are my new favorite people. 

quote of the....w/e:

Caylyn: we are no longer the knights who say NEEE! We are now the Knights who say iche iche f-clang! :mumbles incoherantly::

HAHAH! Choking Amazing."

"event","hehe. I got one of the leads in the fall play <U>Up The Down Staircase</U>. :-D Jamila did too!!! I get to play Caylyn's (Who is the lead) best friend Ellen, and Jamila is a disgruntled/slightly psychotic librarian. haha. I'm tres excited. I for sure thought i was gonna get shafted b/c of all the missed practices i would have. :-D but apparently not. haha

Operation EMMY is ON! Jamila, we are 1 step closer to our goal. <grin>

So I expect to see all of ya'll (that actually live in C-field) to come see it....no excuses. It's gonna play on a Thursday night, a Friday night, and a Saturday night. (after football season is over, unless we go to playoffs, which from what i've seen so far this year...isn't very/at all likely)

SO I BETTER SEE YA'LL THERE!!! Or Jamila and I will hunt ya'll down and do bad bad things.

The Sun is joyful and bright, without fear<br>or reservation. The childish nature of the Sun<br>allows you to play and feel free. Exploration<br>can truly take place in the light of day when<br>nothing is hidden. The Sun's rays fill you with<br>energy so that you may live life to its<br>fullest, milking pleasure out of each day. Such<br>joy and energy can bring wealth and physical<br>pleasure. To shine in the light of day is to<br>have confidence, to soak up its rays is to feel<br>the freedom of a child. Image from: Stevee<br>Postman. http://www.stevee.com/

"event","okay...I ""applied"" for this LJ community, and apparently i got rejected for some reason or another (i didn't have pictures...which i did) and now they wanna be all ""oh? you had pictures where are they?""

Me...I'm over it.

My take is...why do i have to justify myself to you? You don't know me...and i don't care to know you anymore. I must have had a momentary lapse of sanity for wanting to join the stupid group in the first place. 

It's a community for dorks, and really, they're no better than any other clique. But because dorks are SO put down...they wanted to make themselves feel better and exclude people. Which really sucks. 

But like I said...i'm over it. I'll start my own dag on group!


BEEP YOU ALL. haha

<I>Teenage angst at it's greatest...</I>





but onto better things....school was grand. i know that i'm gonna have some issues with my AP government class (2 10 page papers...among other things) but, other than that I'm cool. I am so auditioning for the fall play this year. Everybody is like ""you should...you'd get the part"" apparently it's about these 2 chicks. one black and one white, and their friendship and yadda yadda...but ya. i'm done for the day."

I flirted my little bottom off today...as Caylyn would say. I did a grab and run twice, and i got 3 hugs from Curtis. hehe. so much fun.

Brandy came by today... and she brought Tyrone...her boyfriend. Her balck boyfriend. (for those who don't know...Brandy is white. haha) he is so cute. and she was laughing so hard, because she was getting so many glares from all the girls, because he was with her. lol.

So we get to the mall... and it's effing hot, and right off the bat, we think we see some guys. (hehe. guy spotting should be an olympic sport) and we like followed them around in Dillard's, but they had girls with them, and they really weren't hot after all (SOB). So we walk around...so past Vickie's Secret, pass the hoe store (Wet seal), and end up in H & M for like an hour. haha. we found so truly hot stuff, and we tried them on, and were complete dorks about it all. :) 

Then, we decided we wanted to reinstate SkyLyd, and we talked in our British Accents for the rest of the time, and people kept staring at us, so i would give them funny looks when we passed. (haha). So we go to Hecht's (i think that's how u spell it??) and we were still British, and that's when if started...

I swear from that moment on i couldn't speak correctly. haha. I was trying to say they had the high top version of the non-high top chucks...but it never came out right. so i was just like ""OH MY GOD"" (in the accent) haha. we laughed so hard. 

and then, we tried to find our way home, and ended up on Parham road...so we crashed McDonald's, and revved the engine at some Biotchy girl. haha. So we're driving home, listening to Snow Patrol, and i was explaining how my brain was fried from too much time in the sun (band camp) and i was telling her how me and Mary were acting and no lie i said this, ""We were punch drunk with... ::silence. looks out window::"" lol. We laughed soo hard, and we were eating. and i was just like, 'i knew that was gonna b stupid so i just stopped' haha.

Not much of any interest has happened lately in my life. Nothing actually...well, I can't say actually. Colorguard/ Band camp started, and it's been fun, and our show is gonna rawk so hard. I've Talked to Mary's friend Brandon. Haha. She's trying to play matchmaker. He's cool, He's 18, and is going to college in Fairfax for Graphic arts. (he's an artist/photographer, and he's REALLY good) He tres cool, and kinda like me. :-) so crazy is basically how to  describe him.

I haven't talked to Operation Code Green (wink wink Jamila) very much lately. I talked to him today in passing, he got online as i was getting off, and I told him he sucked b/c that always happens. haha. 

Hung out with Kim and Caylyn Saturday night. We went to Mary Angela's in Cary Town, and then to the Upper Room to hang. Caylyn and i thought it would be cool to talk in accents the whole night, so we pretended we were British! haha. I'm Skyler Porter, and she's Lydia Everette. very cool. We drove my sister crazy on the way home.

WE HAD A KIM ADVENTURE!!! haha

We were driving to Cary Town, and we took the highway, and i was turning around in my seat to tell Caylyn something, and the guy in the SUV next to us thought i was turning to talk to him, so he tried to holler at me (haha, he was like 30. gross!) and he kept speeding up and slowing down to try to talk to us, and he like rolled down his window and crap, and motioned for me to call him, and all i could do was shake my head 'no' with this uber disgusted look on my face. haha. we thought that was the funniest thing.

Kim and Caylyn ganged up on me at Mary Angela's (the pizza place across the street from the Upper room), i guess it was just payback for me and Caylyn's mom ganging up on her about her southern accent. haha.

Today, i went to Burger King with Tiffany after practice...hehe but i stole her car and drove it around the school parking lot. (just an initiation of sorts. I mean Andrew, and Curtis had already done it...so y not me?) lol. much fun.

"event","lol. great subject line huh? Ok...so I'm back from Texas,and it had it's great moments and memories...and the bad ones. Let's start at the end and then go back to the beginning. On the plane...it was the longest 2 hours of my life. But considering the fact that we were changing time zones that's kind of true.

I wanted to shoot myself...in all seriousness. Well actually I wanted to shoot 2 other people first, and If i had i wouldn't need to shoot myself. :-) yea. I was quite emo. 

okay....starting from the beginning.

The plane ride there, I was sitting with Karole, and  we were commenting on the guys on the plane with us, and which ones were cute and such. Well I commented how this boy Travis that came with us was really cute, and she agreed. Well I've kinda liked Travis for some time (cuz he came with us, and was in class with us). But anyway. Karole is the competitive type, and sometimes I am. I thought I had my flirting thing locked down, but apparenly not. 

We get to the hotel, everythings goody goody, and we go to our first classes. Now the boys (minus 1) were all on the team so they had to separate from us a lot of the time, so I decided to get cracking ahead of schedule. I sat next to Travis, and Karole sat next to the boy she liked. I figured she likes this certain guy (who shall remain nameless) she would leave me to my devices...and Travis. 

Apparently I was wrong. I mean...I thought dibbs were sacred, but apparenly not everyone belives that.

Well, I was writing notes, trying to get to know the boy, and everything was great, until a couple of days later when Karole decided that she didn't want just one. (i mean they're boys, not pringles.) So I was like ""whoa...okay. Somebody never learned to share"" So i had some competition. and like i said earlier, i thought i had it on lock. We had this ongoing joke that Travis went for older women...lol. And I'm like a couple months older than him, and Karole's a couple months younger. 

Six Flags...I rode with Travis on all the rides. He was my riding buddy, we flirted and talked and I thought i was doing well....but then...

At the banquet...
I sat next to Travis, and Karole sat next to her boy, but she was also sat next to me. :-( and the whole entire time, they were making goo goo eyes at each other, yet whenever I said something to Karole, she would always assure me that I was the one he liked. Lie. 

So now we get to after the banquet and after the dance, we go back to our chaparone's room and watch movies. Guess who elected that they sit next to Travis? Yup, you guessed it. Karole. so much for helping a friend out.

so now we get to the plane ride back. By this time, they're hanging out with each other like they're attached at the effin hip, and Karole....wants to switch seats with Bryant so she can sit next to Travis. Bryant, bless his heart said Hell no...but then again he also asked me what he should say, and I said Hell no too. But stupid Carlos (one of our chaparones) switched seats with Travis. So I'm next to the window, Karole's next to me, and Travis is on the end. So I'm essentially stuck, and we took like 20 mins to actually take off. So for 20 mins. I was contemplating locking myself in the bathroom so I could get away from those 2 flirting, and holding hands, and laughing, and basically ignoring my existance. Which was quite cruel. considering they knew full well...no, she knew full well that I liked (past tense now) him. I was about to cry. 

I called Caylyn after I got off the plane (ran off is more like it) and told her all about it, and now we have to have smoothie time, and plot they're deaths. lol.

wow. Phillip was right, I would have like a 6 page journal entry. 

So that was my week. Pretty much sucked right? I need a drink. Anyone up for some starbucks?"

I deal with crap, by shutting myself off and not dealing with anyone...so how am I supposed to comfort someone when I have no clue how to comfort myself?

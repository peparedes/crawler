i've been feeling really self conscious and just..ugly and gross lately and a few comments have been passed lately that have just made little things i've battled with for a lot of my life even more of an issue as far as me being self-conscious goes.
anyways, i guess catherine was talking to her mom about it, and when i was leaving her house tonight, breid came up to me and said ""you're a beautiful girl, meaghan"" and hugged me. ugh, i love that family more than life. i don't know what i would do without catherine, as well as her mom. and it just made me so happy and forget about what some say because the people that love me and that matter care about me and think i'm lovely the way i am and think i'm good enough and would never say anything about my looks to hurt me.

on another note, i start school soon and im terrified.. but i met this chick who's taking journalism too (which is awesome cause there's only 25 people in it so im glad i met someone) and im meeting her for coffee or something on tuesday.
-going out for chinese food tonight with cat and fee for fee's birthday!&hearts;
-tomorrow i have to get up at 7 to go down to ottawa u and get my student card/courses/bus pass sorted. awesome. :/ and then hangouts with jess before work! =D
-heading out tomorrow night with the girls to properly celebrate fee's 18th.
-friday dommy is coming over for dinner which is lovely since she hasn't been over in FO-EVAHHHHHHHHH.

<FONT size=1> tonight i sat for 6 and a half hours at work, and throughout most of the time spent at work i was thinking about things i really shouldn't think about while im supposed to be focused on working. things that already make me emotionally unstable enough, so to analyze them over and over (and over and over and over) again while im sitting at a cubicle with hundreds of other people, it's really not the best idea. especially when you start to hyperventilate and have to stop yourself from crying on so many occasions.
i wonder far too often about Chris, the one who the last time i talked to him said he missed me and just wanted ""things to be like they were two weeks ago"" and then disappeared. or rather, made me disappear. i wonder if he still has all my emails saved like before, still has the random stuff i left at his dorm, or still thinks of me when he watches seinfeld or anchorman. but recently, i remembered something that i've been not able to stop wondering for about a week or so now. i remembered the video he had of me. it starts off with me taping it and it begins with me laughing and pointing the camera at him and saying ""does this make you feel awkward?"" while he's trying to grab the camera from me and i'm laughing and moving around in his tiny rez bed. then he takes the camera and is holding it towards me... i'm smiling (i was pretty much constantly smiling with him) and then i try to grab blankets and hide form the camera while we're both laughing and he's trying to prevent me from hiding my face. and then it just cuts out. i wonder if he remembers the video as vividly as i do. i wonder if he looks at it. if he even still has it. if he wonders ""what if?"" as often as i fucking do? i wonder fi he hates me, because though things ended so oddly (or never really ended at all) it made me feel like i had done something terrible to him that he would want to erase me from his life. but i didnt. i was nothing but good to him. why would i do something horrible enough to make a person (not only a person, a person who said ""someone like me and like you should really fall inlove"") want to just wipe me out of their life without any sort of explanation? why would i do something to want christopher to hate me? why would i want to ruin things when everything was so fucking perfect? when i was so fucking happy? why would i do that? i <strike>loved</strike>love him.</FONT></center>"

i am so fucking sick of people not minding their own business and taking it upon themselves to fucking go around spreading shit about other people when they are in no position/have no fucking right to. why does everyone in ottawa feel the need to muck about in other people's business and take it upon themselves to interfere?


people need to learn how to respect others and their business and their lives. and even if they can't appreciate it, it's not their fucking place to get into it.

woke up. felt so nervous that i threw up. cried. went back to sleep after deciding i can't take going to school on a day where people i cannot stand will be parading around with roses and love letters. woke up and searched room vigorously for chocolate. went upstairs and drank tea while reading the paper with my mom, and read the horoscope section which caused me to sob into my teacup and then retreat back into bed. ran out of chocolate. cried. fed my fish and went on the computer. talked to corey who attempted to make me feel better but just made me miss him alot and cry. mom came down and surprised me with a valentine's day present and she hugged me and i cried. in a good way i think. did some pointless world issues homework. waited for a phonecall that i knew wouldn't come. and now im sitting here typing this.

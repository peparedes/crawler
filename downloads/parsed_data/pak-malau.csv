"event","Since on my school holiday, the school organize team building and select ME as a Leader Committee in Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering Design (Meed Club) for my course. What the hack... Maybe I'm the oldest, mature and responsible guy to take this opportunity and share with the student. So i decided to go for the meeting and plan 'what to organize for the newly student the whole year activities'. What the crap right! So we meet up at harbourfront centre kopi tiam sialll brainstorming early in the morning on 1st of April. Supposedly 25 students and 2 teachers have to come. Skali 18 students with 2 teachers only. So we are divide into group and brainstorming of any activities to bring up. All in my group at least got an idea and ME sit there smile and disagree with their idea. HAHAHAHA.... Their plans are Amazing race, Bbq, team building at Sentosa, go museum&nbsp; etc...... I find it bored suggestion. Every time they bring up I just said &quot;Why&quot;? When they can't stand me anymore w/o suggestion and too much complaint, all of them look at me one of them asked me so what is your idea? I'm speechless for 10 secs and luckily something come straight to my head!! I tell&nbsp; them &quot;hmmm.. I can't think now and I need coffee. My head is empty now. HAHAHAHAHA........<br /><br />Slowly kill the time drinking coffee and this girl asked me<br /> &quot; Ni dah lepas minum kopi mesti banyak idea boleh bagi. Cepat sikit ar nak tahu idea abang&quot;...<br />Me: WHAT&nbsp;ABANG???&nbsp; Perli nampak!<br />Me: Kopi masih panas lagi nak kene kasi abis baru ade idea.<br /><br />Padahal I'm waiting for the time to finish all this crap and getting ready for a Southern Ridges walk from Mt.Faber to Alexandra. I put few photos here and you can see the scenery. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to my story, I've plan to give some idea since I sit there for so long and doing nothing. After they start to quiet and thinking, I voice out and say maybe we can bring them for a short trip to Kota Tinggi-johor, to the waterfall? Not far from here and it takes only approximately 2hrs journey and we can learn the culture and the history. That is the outdoor activity. If indoor then we can open up each class a stall cook and sell to all students in the campus and see which class earn more money and the money can donate or class fund or both. They just keep quiet sey and i think they don't agree with my idea. Actually the teachers are listening with my idea! They agree with it and try to bring this up to the Head of Department. The teacher say we have our budget for the trip but this idea should have no problem to our budget. <br />I was saying to my heart&nbsp; &quot;what am I trying to do with this little kids&quot;..

"event","Almost 1mth plus we don't have a good time. My life seems to be not like I used to be when I'm with her. My mind were confused because she don't like to talk things out, sit down and talk to share our feelings. She just quietly without me know and I always the want saying how I feel. Its hard for me because I can't just leave problems that is not solve and silent. When waiting for her to meet up she kept saying we will meet soon. But it never happen. We managed to meet&nbsp; and have a great day but I have to watch out whatever I've said. Cause if i say something about us before&nbsp; about our&nbsp; past, she will not happy and don't wanna talk about it. And don't want to meet me if i say all about the past.&nbsp;
 
I wait for her and I let her decide since I can't do much things. I called her just now and talked to her just to say hi. I told her how my feelings and explained her what she doing like this is not right. She don't face the fact and avoid problems and be happy. I tried my very best and effort to love her and to be with her but she keep on do what she think is right by keeping silent. This is not right. Once I advice her she get pissed of and put down the phone. She put in her blogs 'you're not in my shoe, you don't know what i am going through; you jolly well don't judge'. She don't tell me how am I suppose to know right! How about my Shoe?"

"event","Just got back from hillsboro yesterday it was an amazing experience first couple of days sucked because kylie wasn't talking to me because i am a stupid buttmunch but whats new. but other than that it was pretty sweet most of the 5th and 6th grade guys accepted christ for the first time in their lives it is amazing to see things that nowadays. after we did all our work for the week we went to cannon beach and then the mall it was boring for the most part because i was chillin by myself alot of the time but i did buy black finger nail polish a jthm comic incense and a heavy metal cd i know i said i would stop listening to that crap but it is so hard not to when the music is bomb oh and i bought some strawberry incense. then we got back yesterday i rode the bus halfway home and then i rode with owen the other half which i found out he is old and boring to just hang out with he's a cool guy just not fun to ride with. we got back unloaded the truck and then garrett and i walked to my house dropped my stuff off then walked to his house and hung out till about 10:00 then we went to my house and hung out for a couple of hours. oh and i got my trench coat mr. osterstrom owed me so then i went to sleep woke up and now i'm here doing this whole thing."

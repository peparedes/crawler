Check it out these actual cases.

Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned-out section of forest while assessing the damagedone by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his back, flippers, and face mask. A postmortem test revealed that the man died not from Burns, but from massive internal injuries.
Dental records provided a positive identification. Investigators then set about to determine how a fully Clothed diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire.It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the man went diving off the coast, some 20 miles from the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, had called in a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and emptied at the site of the forest fire 

You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next, he was doing the breast stroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air. Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.

A man was working on his motorcycle on the patio, His wife nearby in the kitchen. While racing the engine, the motorcycle accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handlebars, was dragged along as it burst through the glass patio doors. His wife, hearing the crash, ran in the room to find her husband cut and bleeding,The motorcycle and the shattered patio door. She called for an ambulance and, because the house sat on a fairly large hill, went down the several flights of stairs to meet the Paramedics and escort them to her husband. While the attendants were loading her husband, the wife managed to right the motorcycle and push it outside. She also quickly blotted up the spilled gasoline with some paper towels and tossed them into the toilet.
After being treated and released, the man returned home, looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He went into the bathroom and consoled himself with a cigarette while attending to his business. About to stand, he flipped the butt between his legs The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. Finding him lying on the bathroom floor with his trousers blown away and burns on his buttocks, legs and groin, she once again phoned for an ambulance. The same paramedic crew was dispatched. As the paramedics carried the man down the stairs to the ambulance they asked the wife how he had come to burn himself. She told them. They started laughing so hard, one slipped, dropping the stretcher and dumping the husband out. He fell down the remaining stairs, breaking his arm.

A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen shaking frantically, almost in a dancing frenzy, with some kind of wire running from his waist towards the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current, she whacked him with a handy plank of wood, breaking his arm in two places. Up to that moment, he had been happily listening to his Walkman.

Girl: Slow down. I'm scared. 
Guy: No this is fun. 
Girl: No it's not. Please, it's too scary!
Guy: Then tell me you love me. 
Girl: Fine, I love you. Slow down! 
Guy: Now give me a BIG hug. 
*Girl hugs him*
Guy: Can you take my helmet off and put it on? It's bugging me. 
In the paper the next day ---
A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of break failure. Two people were on it but only one survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his breaks broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him and felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die. That is love."

I thought I saw you look at me.. I thought I saw you care.. Do you know I think your cute.. I like the look you bare..Are my eyes deceiving me, when I see you standing there? Are you playing tricks on me just to prove I care? Are you an illusion is it only in my mind? Do you look at me as I do you.. To see you can find a little bit of intrest, a stolen glance your way.. Will you come and talk to me or watch me day to day? You may have taken notice that Im not very shy.. I like to tell my girls when I like a certain guy.. I do not mean to scare you but I've thought of you alot.. But now I simply want to know.. Do you like me .. Or not?

One Day Your Prince Charming Will Come.. Mine Just Took A Wrong Turn Got Lost And Was To Stubburn To Ask For Directions...

Written with a pen...Sealed with a kiss...If you are my friend answer me this:
Are we friends, or are we not?
You told me once but i forgot.
So tell me now, and tell me true,
So I can say ""I'm here for you""
Of all the friends I've ever met,
Your the one I won't Forget,
 And if I die before you do,
I'll go to heaven and wait for you,
I'll give the angels back their wings, and risk the loss of everything, There isn't a thing I wouldn't do to have a best friend just like you....

I wish dreams were like wishes, and wishes came true, cause in my dreams I'm always with you.

You know you're in love when all you can think about is that one special person and you can't stand to be away from them for more then one second. You miss then even though they're standing right next to you. You fall asleep thinking about them, and dream about them every night. 

I wrote your name in the sand, but the waves washed it away. I wrote your name on my hand but I washed it the next day. I wrote your name on a piece of paper but I acciedenatally threw it away... I wrote your name in my heart and forever it will stay! 

One day you'll come to me and ask me what's more important: You or my life. I'll say my life and you'll walk away never knowing that you're my life. 

Who do you turn to when the only person who can stop your crying is the one who made you cry? 

*No matter how many times 
I say I love you 
it wouldn't matter 
no matter how many times 
you say I love you too 
it wouldn't matter 
'cuz we can't say it enough 
to max out our love for each other* 

~no matter what people say 
I will love you each andn every day 
no matter what people do 
just know I will always love you~

Love is hope. Hope is faith. Faith is trust. Trust love. 

If I could hold a star for everytime you made me smile, I would have the entire night sky in the palm of my hand. 

It takes only a minute 2 get a crush on someone, an hour 2 like someone, and a day 2 love someone, but it takes a lifetime 2 forget someone! 

Smiling is the second best thing you can do with your lips. . . what's the first? Once u figure it out tell me! 




Loving you is like breathing... how can I stop? 

 Fine guys open my eyes...
Smart guys open my mind...
But only a sweet guy can open my heart... 

I wanted a guy that was nice and in touch with his feelings, but then i realized..they all have have boyfriends already. 

Meeting you was fate, becoming your friend was a choice, but falling in love with you was beyond my control.

My head is in the clouds... 
My heart is in the sky... 
My mind is in a dreamboat... 
And you're the reason why. 

Give me a kiss, give me the world, give me your heart, I'll be your girl, give me your smile, give me your time, give me your love, I'll give you mine.

I ran up my door,
Shut the stairs,
Got in my prayer,
Said my pajamas,
Jumped in light,
And turned off the bed.
All cause you kissed me goodnight. 

My heart is all black and blue from all the abuse it has been through. No more abuse, no more shame, all because my love for you isnt a game...i'm tired of all your lies, and all the crap you say. As i leave my love for you behind, my heart is screaming YAY...yay for no more abuse, no more pain, and no more sorrow....now my heart can heal...but it wont be healed by tomorrow. How could i have been so blind to see...how much loving you was hurting me? I dont care anymore beacuse i am free...free from all the pain, that your love has caused me. 

~*~Luv Means Never Having 2 Say Ur Sorry~*~ 

So many frogs... so few princes 

The hardest thing in life is watching someone you love love someone else. 

""People say that Love is giving someone the ability to destroy you, but trusting them not to.
If you really love me tell me what I want to hear, but those other words are what I fear.
If you really love me, would you stand by my side?
Would you care for me? Be there for me? Be there when I cry? 
Don't tell me you love me when you have someone else on your mind. 
Don't tell me you want me when you have someone else by your side.
I really don't wanna hear it, because you'll break my heart.
Don't try to fix what is broken. Don't even start.
If you didn't notice...I'm In love with you."" 

It's hard enough when the one you love doesn't love you back, but it is even harder to watch him love someone else. 

Missing you isn't what hurts... It's knowing that I once had you, that breaks my heart. 

KISS ME IN THE LIGHT.......
LOVE ME IN THE DARK........
HOLD ME 'TIL THE END.......
AND I PROMISE I WON'T BREAK YOUR HEART 

Sometimes I wish I had never met you because then I could go to sleep at night not knowing there was someone like you out there. 

I have to find you, I have to meet you...
Lose me...Hate me...Smash me...Erase me... but whatever you do... don't break my heart! 

I am scared to fall in love...
I am scared to fall out of love...
and I am scared of not bein' loved by the one I love right now! 

If your asking if I need you the answer is forever... if your askin' if I'll leave you the answer is never... if your askin' what I value the answer is you... if your askin' if I love you the answer is I do. 

It's okay for students to ask dumb questions; they're easier to handle than dumb mistakes. 

Homework: (Noun) a punishment given to students by evil teachers after the students have already put in 7 hours of hard labor. (See evil, torture, wrong, cruel, unjust, satan, crap) 

How come teachers can have substitutes? It's not fair that they can have substitutes and we can't have any to take our place in class. 

Reality is only an illusion that occurs due to a lack of alcohol. 

Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll still land among the stars. 

When you were born, everyone around you was smiling and you were crying. Live your life so that when you die, you're smiling and everyone around you is crying. 

Without fear, there is no courage. 

10% of life is what happens to you, and the other 90% is how you react to it.

Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their shoes.

Being a teenager is tough, sometimes life isn't fair, other times it is, and even then I say eff that! 

Too Bad you weren't there
For all is said and done.
Too Bad you hadn't come,
For we are now done.
Our love wasn't strong enough
For you to keep and hold,
But for you,
TOO BAD YOU WEREN'T BOLD! 

In a flash
You were gone.
I still rememeber what was on your tounge.
On your tounge,
Were some hurtful words,
That didnt hurt very much
They were just words.
My heart is still broken
I still hate that it's true
But you are gone
And we let our love go poof.

I like long walks. Especially when they are taken by people like you.

Oh dear! Looks like you fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down! 

The reason god put spaces in between your fingers was so another person's hands could fill it up. 

The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up. 

Never be afraid to try something new. Remember, amateurs built the ark; professionals built the Titanic! 

Yesterday was that past, Tomorrow is the future, Today is a gift...that is why they call it the present. 

If God wanted the world to be a peaceful then why did God make so much crime and murder? 

""Don't be afraid of death, be afraid of an unlived life...""

My Angel is the One,
He holds me in his arms.
My Angel is the Best,
For he is strong and calm.
My Angel is there for me,
100% of the time.
My Angel has love for me,
That is very pure and kind.
My Angel is the One,
That will hold me for all of his life,
My Angel has it all,
For I am his life. 

Anyone can give up, it's the easiest thing in the world to do. But to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart, that's true strength.

Life is like a song... Sing it.
Life is like a challenge... Pursue it.
Life is like a sacrifice... Offer it.
Life is love... Enjoy it. 

If I had a star for every time you brightened my day, I'd be holding the galaxy. 

When it seems you are at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on. :) 

Good better best never let it rest until your good is your better and your better your best! 

Three People can keep a secret if two of them are dead

im just ~*me*~ and thats all i can be
no more..no less..dont 2nd guess
i love..i laugh..i live..i cry
and sometimes i feel like i wanna die
some days im funny..others im not
sometimes im crazy & hyper and i cant stop
you might love me..

Many may hate me,few may like me,but there's only one who matters...the one reading this

Have you ever wondered what hurt more?!?
Saying something and wishing you hadent...or saying nothin and wishing you had? 

your life is like a butterfly...you go through changes before you become something beutiful. 

To love someone is nothing
To be loved by someone is something
To love and be loved by someone is everything"

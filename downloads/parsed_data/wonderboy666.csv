"event","Had to give these a go (see previous two posts), as inspired by friend in Melbourne who showed them to me. Well, hey - its fun!

Have had a good weekend by far - very active for me actually: Friday drinks after work, then out to a couple of clubs later with an old friend in Darlinghurst. (Haven't seen him for ages). Saturday caught with best friend and his wife, daughter and newborn son again - went to Paddington Markets and had coffee - very enjoyable. Rang friend on Saturday night, made arrangements to catch up over xmas break. Watched Virgin Suicides on SBS on Saturday night (pretty good film!). Went for swim this morning and heading for BBQ at friend from work's place now.

It just occurred to me that I haven't really posted anything very personal yet. More just what I've been up to. Well, I think it will slowly start to happen eventually - I am quite shy anyway.

Just heard from good friend in Melbourne who I visited recently. His life sounds very busy and a bit hectic but am glad to hear from him. Makes me want to be back down there again..."

"event","Back at work - has been a bigger shock to the system than I anticipated. Have felt like I have been sleepwalking ever since holidays. Not interested in work. Looking forward to xmas break, but next year will be hellish - everyone at work is bracing themselves. <br /><br />Am thinking of going out tonight - very unususal for me. Anyway, it is summer so...<br />"

"event","Well, here goes...
Went back to work today. Am missing girlfriend. Am missing being on holiday. Since I got back from Melbourne on Monday after staying with a close friend for a few days. Had a great time, meant some great people, made me think about moving down there. Maybe one day. Sydney is too much. I felt a little like an imposter sometimes whilst I was there. Like I was carrying the Sydney intensity whilst walking amongst those who were free of such an affliction.

Felt like a long day at work today coz I wasn't in my usual frantic work mind-state - probably a good thing. Am looking forward to xmas break. Just over two weeks away, but have heaps to do before then, both at work and in my own life.

Still haven't finished my book which is good, gives me something to read on train. Am missing my bike a bit, but not too much. The book is nearly finished. I have enjoyed it a lot. Made me wish I could have lived a similar life to the hero - war photojournalist in Vietnam and Cambodia. I am such a romantic. I know I am really just cut out&nbsp; for my life, but I can't help getting swept up in something exciting such as the story I am reading.

Was really happy since I got to spend yesterday with my best friend and his wife and their daughter and newly born son. I am bit envious, but actually a lot more proud, and happy for my friend since he has really got it together even though he may struggle through life like so many of us. Once again I found myself hoping that maybe one day I could 
have a family like my friend's...&nbsp;&nbsp;  maybe one day if I'm lucky...."

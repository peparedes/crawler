"event","Well I came over to my moms this morning to get some stuff done.. but started thinking and got all distracted. I did call a few houses though and leave messages... which is kinda almost getting things done? heh.... So the past few days have just been stupid. We all went to Ambers a few night ago and it was fun for the most part.. the only dumb part was right after I came in all pissed off (I do not even remember WHY I was mad to begin with)... and saw Jesse and Vanessa setting up to go sleep where I had just been told no one could sleep (because I had fallen asleep there... and had to relocate) ANYWAY... I informed them that no one could sleep in that room and then they were like ""ACTUALLY, no one can sleep in that BED... you don't know what your talking about.. yadda yadda."" and me of course being in a bad moood to begin with instead of walking away I decided to go on and tell them they were wrong... yadda yadda.... and so it ended in me having to pee and Vanessa storming around the house drunk and pissed as hell at me.... Jesse was pissed at me too.... Oh well.. I did apologize for the way I went about the situation and Jesse seemed to be alright with me but Vanessa will not look at me. I think it is retarded seeing as how they were drunk and it was all just a stupid argument over a room... especially considering..... but I guess I should not be surprised.... and Carrie 'can't be around me' because she accused me of stealing money, which came out of no where and is completely retarded as well.... I have no idea what the fuck she is talking about... but instead of spreading rumors and shit she could talk to me.... whatever.... Im obviously too horrible or some shit.... raar."

I dont even know what this feeling is... mostly rage. i sit and fester this new rage that is most likely going to come out full force soon because its really fucking difficult to keep pushing aside. fuck you all."

Last night was super fun watching everyone get drunk 'cause it was like the first time I was not drinking with them while we were in a house. BUT.... next weekend shall be fun 'cause we are either drinking downtown and sleeping at Vanessa's or everyone is coming over to our house. AND we had our appointment at the Downtown River Apartments yesterday and I think we are going to get in... man I hope so!!!!!! One bedrooms are more uncommon than 2 bedrooms, so we will most likely get a 2 bedroom and it'll be awesome. The only bad thing about the apartments is that I can not have a dog over 25lbs and I want a medium dog. Well Im gunna go play speed with Kent.. soooo bye!"

Today was alright... considering. Don't ask.. Im just a dumb ass. However, in the end I learned a few people's true colors.. stuff I've known for awhile, but overlooked. oh wel.. shit happens. Misha..... Mark and Nicole's cat had her kittens today! There is 6 of them. I really want the little orange one... but everyone does so we will probably end up with a black one.

Im just chillen at my mom's house. Kent is at home sleeping 'cause he worked graveyard last night. I doubt that he'd come down here anyway.... he hasn't wanted to do ANYTHING lately..... like leaving the house is some HUGE event... and leave Santa Rosa is a long journey.I  don't get it... he used to like to do things. Now he just wants to stay home all the time, play the computer, smoke, and sleep.... that's it. Oh well..... hopefully it's a phase.. plus we are moving to P-town soon and then our house will be way more convenient. yup My damn lap top will not turn on, so I can not use the internet at my house.... I am going to the computer place next week hopefully to ask about it. Brito and Nessa stayed at my house last night... 'twas fun fun... the Sims 2 is fuckin awesome... so we got extremely stoned and played the computer. We put on the Simpsons after that, but all 3 of us passed out right when we layed down at like 2:30.... then we had to get up early 'cause I had to drive them home and stuff for Easter crap.Ack..

No one is really where they want or need to be.... but struggling on their way there instead. Some of us have gotten lost..... but so far no one has completely given up..... yeah... these are weird days... I miss the old days soo much, but at the same time I am pretty excited to see what will come... I should try and be like Carrie and just live for the moment.<br /><br />Alright.. moving on. I put some lasagna in the microwave,,,, it said to put it on for 5 minutes... rotate and then put on for another 2.... but I figured since the microwave has one of those trays that continually spins.. the rotation was unnecessary... sooooo I just put it on for 7 minutes and left..... I wonder if it is done yet..... I shall go check... yep it's done.. but i stepped in fucking dog pee on the way to the garage (fucking DOG!!!) MmMmMmMm.. veggie lasagna.. Kent bought a bunch of veggie stuff for me when he went shopping with his dad... whoo hooo....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :-P&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So.. none of this is really relevant, but I do not have to work until 3:45 today and Kent wanted me to wait for him to get off work instead of going to P-town.. so Im pretty bored. I&nbsp;did get high after dropping Kent off and fell asleep again for 2 hours... man oh man I had one CrAzY ass dream! I can not even fully explain it... it was awesome though! I love dreaming and I always have the most interesting dreams after getting stoned.... go figure eh? haha At&nbsp; Vanessa's the other day Kent and I decided we want 2 Nintendo DSs.... I dunno if I should put an s or es..... hum.... well anyways then we will not be so bored in the Phoenix all the time... haha.. Hide N go Seek was pretty fucking fun though. </font></p>
<br />
<p><font color=""#333399"">I finally got my car from my mom... yippee... freedom to go to Petaluma and not have to freeze at the bus stop..... plus now I can drive everyone home and stuff. Damn... I just finished eating .. that was hella bomb! Well... now I need to go smoke.. so I guess Im done on LJ.... gah.. I don't wanna work today!! I hate closing! raar No work tomorrow... whooo hoo</font></p>"

I am so sick of dealing with this constant anxiety that NEVER leaves anymore.. before I only had anxiety some of the time.. but now it is worse than ever..... always there lurking and then spurting out in sudden panic attacks. This is dumb... and I do not know how to control this unnecessary feeling... ack!.... I feel sick. It sucks even more because now when I do hard drugs it only makes it worse... acid was fun for a few hours until the anxiety kicked in and yesterday I was on e.... ecstasy.. IM supposed to be happy right? I usually am.. but this time I freaked out.... left P-town with out saying bye to anyone.... sat in the car.... felt happy for like an hour or so and then I was just anxious for the rest of it.... aaaaaaaah I hate my brain... stupid stupid stupid brain!!!! I hate this and I can't control it at all... its taking over and I kinda wanna just crawl in a box and never come out again."

#1 Do NOT give a drunk person weird orange putty, if they find it themselves- confiscate it.. and hide it.

#2 Do not let drunk people share the weird orange putty with other drunk people.

#3 The weird orange putty melts easily with body heat.

#4 It is just about impossible to get the weird orange putty out of hair, clothes, beds, carpets, and fingernails.

#5 Water does not help... it just gets sticky.

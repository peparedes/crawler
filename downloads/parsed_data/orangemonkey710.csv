"event","my first basketball game was yesterday...we won...27 to 14...I made 6 points...yeah...
  After the game i went to my friend Samantha's house...we then went to open gym basketball...we got there like 10 minutes eairly...we opened the door to the gym and the alarm went off...we got scared...but we didn't leave...Sam's dad said the police would come and everything...The alarm turned off after a while and we went in...her dad said the police wern't going to come and that he was kidding...he helped us on our layups...then everyone started to come...we started to play a game...it was just the 4 of us...sam,her mom,her dad,and me...then these boys started to go over where we were...on of the boys we called swim trunk boy...he was wearing his swim trunks...hahahahahaha....we left later...
  we went to McDonalds...when we got back to her house we put glitter glue and dececorated our boring basketball bags...they aren't boring any more...
  We got so tired that we just watched Uptown Girls...a movie...neither of us watched the whole thing

"event","guess what tomorrow is my first b-ball game...yea yea yea yea...
the shirts are my fav. color...orange..we even got duffel bags...a couple days ago I got shoes...and I also got shorts today...
    My school is gonna do a penny dive...the twist is that...there will be 3 jars...one labeled 3rd grade..1 4nd...and 1 5th...you only want pennys in your jar...but other ppl can put silver coins...checks or dollars...you do not want that because...say someone puts a 25.00 check in your jar that 25.00 is subtracted out of your amount...in the end it all still goes to the tsumani victums but you just don't want it in your jug...in the end the teachers and staff will add the money up..all the grades...and they will match it...but they won't go over 1,000 dollars...The thing we get is the grade with the most amount of money gets an ice cream party...yea yea yea...
    My lil sis is goin nuts...she is laughin at her own laugh...i have to admit it is pretty funny...
    She is so so so happy because her 1st b-ball practice is tomorrow...My mom is not happy because she had to call the school instead of the coach calling her...that is not very uncool..another thing that is not cool is that her practice is at 9am...lucky for me I might get out of it...I will just say that I want to sleep because my game is at 1:30...
    I haven't told jen about me bein mad...I don't know what to do...HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

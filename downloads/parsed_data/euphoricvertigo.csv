which is probably the hardest thing ill ever have to do
(if you know me, you'll know why)
i cant handle seeing people that i love in sorrow
it just flicks some switch inside of me that makes me freeze up and freak out
i get so angry and frustrated
ive always tried to be so strong but 
sometimes

stop trying so hard
just get over it



this is it, i can see the end and i wouldnt have ever imagined it looks this beautiful

i love rice, even when its burnt :-P



So Ive decided that not only is this the end of high school, and the end of my life as I have always known it, but its the end of every relationship I have ever established. The way I see it, I have my friends right now, but once we all move that friendship ends, as we will all go our seperate ways. I feel the only way to truly know who your friends are, is by cutting every single one loose. Ive gotten to the point with everyone in Venice that if they want my friendship, they are gonna have to work their asses off to get it. Im a pretty awesome fucking friend, I have thrown away so much shit for these people, and Im watching as they just, not only ignore it, but the bond in general. Ive been lied to more times than I can count, and its ironic that its been from the people I have known the longest. I feel like Im almost dead from this suffication. I love my friends, I really do, but I've got to get away from this unwavering egotism. Ill say it, some of them, Ive never met anyone more intelligent, more eloquent, more intuned with people and the lives of everyone around them. So why is it that they feel the need to ruin their intellect with presriptions, and  benzoylmethyl ecognine, and THC, i dont see the attraction. Sure ill burn once in a while, and ive been known to put shit up my nose, but for christ sake, grow up, and see how much there is to life. You of all people know, but you just neglect everything around you. Maybe its this town, maybe its just that its too hard to find something more productive. But regardless of what is it, this shouldnt be the reason why I have been ostrasized from your life. Its flattering to know that your love for snorting, smoking, eating, chewing, and injecting, has outdone my love for you. But im done. Done with the drugs, done with trying to make you see, done with trying to see for myself, done with acting like your mothers, done with holding your head, done with checking your pulse, done with spotting you cash, done with trying to make you love me, and make you see that im here. Because im not anymore. I just cant be."

"event","so like ive been thinking alot about my life thus far and my life in the future. 
superficially, im a spoiled brat, i get whatever i want/need and ive always had loving parents
so i dont understand why i have had such a problem
like my entire life has been based on not only trying to live up to my family's expectations, but trying to prove myself as well, in addition to continuously being the outcast when it came to the divorce of my parents. 
like no one will understand how hard it was being part of such a large family, and everytime you are around even one of them, the condescending question of, ""so, i hear your spending alot oftime with your father, how is he?"" just instigates more and more hatred. because you know they are really saying, ""so i hear spending too much time with your father is turning you into a little fuck up?"" then of course the underlying question of, ""why cant you be more like sarah?"" 
although my mom continously denies her efforts of trying to turn us into little sub-VanDerees
its not hard to see her lieing when they ask about me, or at least trying to cover up the obvious
*no shes not president of the debate club
*uhhh she hasnt done 100 hours of volunteer work for the hospital . . . .yet
*well julie is such a social person. . . .
*no julie didnt get strait A's


im just so burnt out on my family, and with this school
they are one in the same
in the end, i end up putting on a fake face, for people that i insist wont effect my future, but inevitably will.
i act like i care, but i really dont
i act like i try, but i never do
i act like this means everything, but it never did

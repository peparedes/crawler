im just complaining. for one class i am reading 4 books at the same time...like in one week. 

ew i didnt do work in high school. what is this. ew. i hate it. 

not only that but its like mentally and emtionally taxing. i have a huge proposal due and i dont even no what to do because i didnt do ANYTHING in high school. seriously. 




on top of everyone i have to memorize the ENTIRE intro to the canterbury tales. 

ok im done complaining



i love my life and it is perfect here and i learn so many new things everyday. i love my life here...

i love the weekends.

i love having best friends who have apartments that let me sit in them and cuddle with people during the day.

im doing really good here so like its like i have something to look forward to. its all worth it in the end. 
i dont no if you guys know but after sophomore year they take the bfa class and cut it in half and make half the class go into a BS degree..

i miss people alot and like last night took me off guard bc i am having the time of my life. but i guess there are always reservations. its wierd like at home i had like different friends that made me feel different ways and some acted crazy while others were calm and easy to chill with and idont feel like the people here are replacing people back home, just that i feel like a joke i could have said to a designated person back home translates to someone here and like im crazy with some dpeopl back home and there is the group here that im crzy with, i dont no if that evn makes sence.

yes. so i feel myself growing up and detaching from west springfield. im so ready to leave. i feel like iv learned what im supposed to in high school/ life thus far and now its time to start a new journey with new people, new inside jokes, new memories, new state, new dreams. 

i cant wait to leave. i feel like the summer is dragging on FOREVER. iv already been out for like OVER a month. 

all i want to do is go to NYC and be there, thats the only time im content, it used to be when i was having fun with my friends but now its not like that anymore. i only want to be in the city around theatre people. ew. i hate that i just said that.

i want to drink tea and eat hummus in a 10 story walk up 5 blocks from time square and have a waitoring job.

i want that.

i want people.

hmm.

interesting. im like not content. im happy everything is wonderful in my life. truly. it is. but i just feel like im not in my niche (sp?), and my niche is somewhere in upstate ny.

"event","I AM ATTENDING SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY NEXT FALL FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:

-I need to make a desicion... and its what my gut told me.

-Syracuse has a more well know and say i decide to apply to for a job not in theatre when i gradte, a degree from Syracuse is a degree from Syracuse (the #48 best school in the COUNTRY)

-Syracuse goes to london to study at the globe for an ENTIRE SEMESTER, not just a couple weeks like some programs and you can get credits performing and certified in the program to put on a resume = experiacne/connections/ LIVING IN LONDON. Also, london is like the best city in thw world to study theatre in, who wants to go to the netherlands?

-Syracuse has a SEMESTER in NYC living in fucking HOTELS right in time square for an entire semester not just a stupid ""spring board WEEK"" like some other programs. During the semester you not only have acting classes but meet with casting directors and find out how to market yourself and sell yourself. You also see alot of broadway and off-broadway shows with talkbacks with the cast. (CONNECTIONS!)

-Syracuse has an optional week in LA over winter break senior year to go down and meet with alumni working in the buisness,take classes, and live in LA

-Syracuse has tons of people on broadway that graduated from the program like julia murney (elphaba in wicked) robb sapp (boq in wicked) two other enemble in wicked, taye diggs (wicked and rent)vanessa williams (famous and the original witch in the ""into the woods"" revival), some girl from ""the departed"", aaron sorkin, writer and producer of the west wing

-Syracuse has Syracuse Stage where u can meet actors and directors and earn EMC and equity pouints. Not to mention talk to visitng actors and directors about the buisness.

-Syracuse better prepares you when you leave in terms of you have gone more places and has a big alumni following...like graduates of the program are like ""yea i met people who didnt even read my resume, just that i went to the 'cuse and they hired me""...so yea big following in NYC AND LA.

-Syracuse is more diverse, so i would be with not only artsy people, like in the dept but everyone, lit majors chem architect...etc...etc

-All the drama majors move into apartments their sophomore year across the street from Syracuse Stage and live together = ALOT OF GOOD TIMES

-For every 12 people that auditioned at Syracuse, they took 1. So everyone is really goodd...

-Syracuse is going to let me take singing and dancing with some of the best teachers for no additional fee (emerson you had to pay extra)

-Kids who go to the school said everyone hops in a car and drives down to NYC a couple times a month and stay with friends to see shows and i have many friends in NYC next year...mostly at PACE.

-YOU CAN DOUBLE MAJOR OR MINOR AND GET A BFA IN ACTING. No other program does this, next year they are starting a directng minor taought by the artistic director of Syracuse Stage, one of the most well knopwn regiaonl theatres in the country. MMMmm directing...

-Already have 3 best friends from facebook :)

- People are NOT stuck up and everyone seems (and iv been told) get along really well.

-I found a theatre major to dorm with and we are completely different in looks (no compettion) and like how we are but get along really well and have many of the same interests. and hes wicked cool, almost as cool as me...lol



So yes, that will be my life. :)

thank you for your help."

this statement most described my life. i love emerson to death, its me to a 't'...whatever that means. 

i love syracuse, it offers me so much and during the moch class i wanted to vomit the dept was so good.

both those statemtnes about the school are exactly the same in length which is retarted becuase i really am depressed. i like hate going out.

i know like im like being stupid becuase i should be happy but im not, money is not the issue, both are the sam price.

holy crap. like this isnt even funny, i just talked to maura for like an hour about everything, i really dont know what to do, especially after visiting both, i loved emerson the school itself and the selectivness of the dept.

but syracuse is huge and diverse, emerson is not, and the program at syracuse is wonderful. but im stuck in the middle of nowhere...this is terrible becuase people reading this probly dont care but its the biggest decision of my life, literally.

what if i dont want to be an actor for 4 years? emerson les u switch aroyund if u want after 2 years because eveyone mostly takes the same classes the first 2 years (performnce emphaasis)

I have new best friends at both places, thats not an issue becuase i love poeple both places. 

emerson has WAY better food and dorms.

syracuse has a more well know, better educated respected school... i think.

at emerson i can audtion throughout the city and be cast.

syracuse goes to nyc for an entire semester.

both programs go over seas for a whole semester. emerson to the netherlands, syracuse to london.

EMERSON HAS THE CUTLER MAJESTIC and is rated #1 for theatre colleges becase its in the center of the theatre district in boston and everyone comes and sees the shows at the only college to own their separate broadway style theatre.

syracuse has tons of people on broadway that graduated from the program like julia murney (elphaba in wicked) robb sapp (boq in wicked) two other enemble in wicked, taye diggs (wicked and rent) some girl from the departed, aaron sorkin, writer and producer of the west wing.

emerosn is offering me dancing at boston conservitory and singing leesons with the best singing teachers right off the bat freshman year, syracuse you arent garenteed anythign

syracuse has syracuse stage where u can meet actors and directors and earn EMC and equity pouints (i already have EMC

at emerson i can see people more and go to different college theatre like bu bc suffolk and see megan maura alexis justin...everyone in boston clark ania everyone from my grade.

syracuse i feel like better pre pares you when you leave in terms of you have gone more places and has a big alumni following

emerson has a separate campus set up in la and you can spend tons of time there and meet industry people

syracuse is mainly nyc oriented and have to audition for a program that goes to la.

emerosn is mainly film oriented in the last two years and after grad but u are doing and learning theatre all the way through...

the people at emerson are all like artsy ''robbie'' epople and i know 2 people there (joa stenning and justinbe spingler) who are like me and love it to death. everyone there is like art oriented and is knon as an ''attractive campus'' like everyone loks good there

syracuse is more diverse and i would be with chem engeneers and theatre people but the theatre people are all upper class.



IM SO STUCK. I TOLD ALL THIS TO MAURA AND SHE TOLD ME WHERE SHE THINKS I WANT TO GO LIKE SUBLIMINALLY, IF YOU DIDNT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE SCHOOLS, WHERE WOULD YOU GO? LIKE SUBSTITUE THE SCHOOL NAME FOR LIKE SCHOOL A AND SCHOOL B....

THANK YOU.

...im going on a very long walk, its beautiful out."

"event","So yeah.

I spent the past 3 days in NYC and it was amazing, i wish i was still there, evry other time i was in nyc i really didnt care if i had to leave becuase i was tired and stuff and i liked going back to my real life but after being t all these schools and stuff, i love it there and wish i could have stayed my whole life.

Auditions went better than i could have ever imagined. At Carnegie Mellon which i think is  like my first choice, i went into the audition and did my 2 monolouges, then the lady was interested so she had me do my back up (if they wanted to see more) and i did it and she said i was definatly very talented and all then we talked about my resume and she was impressed and said ""wow you do aot of musical theater, why didnt you audition for that program""and i went on a rant baout how much i love acting and all and she said, well just for kicks, why dont ytou sing for me. I sang 'why god' from Miss Saigon and she said wow you definatly have a voice i want you to go sing for the head of the musical theater program, i told her i didnt have sheet music and wanst warmed up and she sais she didnt care and i should go see him. 

Ok so let me just tell you that Carnegie Mellon is like top 3 musical theater schools in the country, the lead in Wicked (megan Hilty) went there, the lead in Avenue Q went there (Howie Michael Smith) and she obveously knows them and after i sang she thought i shoyuld sing for the head of the department, unschedualed and raw. That along is the best thing ever, like you reading will never know how amazing that is, she could have just said, oh good voice, and nothing else but she took the time to get me a slot with this guy,

So i went into the next room with all the ther kids staring at me becuase she was tlaing about it and me rather loudly in the hallway and then i went in with the guy and Sang 'Why God' and he said ""great"" now do you have anything uptempo and i said im sorry but i wasnt prepared to do a musical theater audition and he was so nice and said sing what you love so i sang 'purpose' from avenue q and he said that he wanted to me to go to the dance audition witht he head of the dance dept.

now lets review aagin, the 2 chair poeple of the best 3 myusical theater schools in the country wkept wanting me to do more, if he didnt think i could get into the program, why have me dance? he was so nice and wanted me to do more. As it turns out the dance was over for the day and came back to me and said 'good job, you are now strongly being considered for the acting and MT (musical theater) program.


I left and was happy. Thsoe of you dont understand whatn a big deal this is for auditioners to spend one second extra on a student that they have to...SO THAT LJ HATER THAT SAID I WAS A BAD SINGER CAN TAKE THIS STORY AND SHUV IT RIGHT UP THEIR ASS.

THEN i left, got food and won lotto for avenuq q and saw avenue q in the FRONT ROW ON BROADWAY FOR 20$ KNOWING THAT REALISTICALLY, THAT COULD BE ME SOMEDAY BECUASE I AM LIKED BY THE SAME PEOPLE THAT EDUCATED THE LEAD OF THAT SHOW.

avneue q was amnazing...i bought a tshirt and book then wnet back to the hotel, in time square to sleep.

SECOND DAY.

FORDAM (Denzel went there)

Beautiful ficking school right nect to the lincoln center like 4 blocks from time sqaure.

To make a long story short i did my 2 monolouges, they liked me and sent me on to the next room (callback) to do them for the WHOLE FUCKING FACULTY. So. I did and they asked me lots of questions and told me that i picked really good monolouges etc etc. I was waiting outside the second room for like an hour before i went in and saw like 30 kids circulate through and only one other kid who lookedalot like me was asked to go to the second room. I made friends with him and we talked about how lucky we were and about our lives and it was awesome becuase i cant wait to go to college and make friends. He was cool but i will never see him again. So yes. Fordam was amazing, you probly dont realizehow amazing it s to go on to the second room two days in a row (it means they really like you)


That night i saw Kriten Chenoweth in The Appel Tree, FUCKING AMAAZING. I loved it. perfect way to end a perfect day.

Today was Pace. It was good, I did my monolouges for the head of the DEPT and got taped and everything, it went really well but the lady i loved the mot was the headof the musical theater dept. but anyway, so i was interviewed for like 15 minutes and i had really good answers, then i did my monoluges and he really liked them, and then i left to ocme home(there was no other facualty there that day looking at studnets) Pace went really good, i hope i get it, i felt really confidnt about it.


So now im home.

Butim depressed bevcuase i odnt belong in West Springfield. I hate it here, i truly do. I want togo back to NYC, iit is becutiful there, imiss the trashy side streets and the subway and the cold and the smell, it feels more like home than where i am now. I need to get out of here, i hate school.

SO. good weekend, but i wish ii was back in NYC....NYC what is it about you?"

so syracuse went REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY well. like amazing. like the lady in the room gave me the biggest EGO trip ever and its good becuase like everyone says ""oh you can be the best in western mass but who cares, there are a million others like you""

it went well...


i cant wait for the next auditions, im so ready for them.

"event","I love you"" means that I accept you for the person that you are, and that I do not wish to change you into someone else. It means that I will love you and stand by you even through the worst of times. It means loving you even when you're in a bad mood, or too tired to do the things I want to do.It means loving you when you're down, not just when you're fun to be with. ""I love you"" means that I know your deepest secrets and do not judge you for them, asking in return that you do not judge me for mine. It means that I care enough to fight for what we have and that I love you enough not to let go. It means thinking of you, dreaming of you, wanting and needing you constantly, and hoping you feel the same way for me."

"event","That I was supposed to die in that car accident this evening. Satan said it was my time, then the Lord interveined and said NO, Im not through with her yet. I see all the things I have taken for granted. I was living for me, not for him. I will now live for him as he has saved me twice. Once on the cross and tonight, he let me live through that horrible car accident. I will give thanks every morning when I awake and every night before I sleep, that the Lord has given me this day. I want to tell everyone what they mean to me every time I see them, and say goodbye to everyone before they or I leave, incase that is my last time I get to see them. I give all Praise to the Lord."

"event","We were on our way to meet my parents for dinner, we were riding with Ron in his car to meet them. It was raining, we were coming off the freeway towards everett, when I looked up we were about to crash. Then BAM! We smashed into a SUV, a nicely dressed (obviously wealthy) man got out, said there is no damage to his vehicle, everyone seems alright, said he had to get to the airport, and drove away. Ron, Noah, Brianna and I just rear-ended someone going 45-50mph, Ron put his foot on the break, but we skid into the other vehicle anyway. The Seatbelts saved all of our lives tonight. Brianna is my 10year old daughter, she was sitting in the front, the airbag should have came out, it didnt. The seatbelt cut her neck in two or three places, both Brianna and I have bruising where our seatbelts were, Noah and Ron say they are fine. Noah was in the backseat with me, I hit my head and body against the seat in front of me, if it had not been padded, I would have got knocked out by hitting it so hard. As we were going down the freeway just before I looked up to see us crash, I was praying, not for our driving, but just in general. After this accident tonight, I see even more how much the Lord is with me, with us. I praise him My daughter, My brother, and Our friend Ron and I are all alive, because Ron no longer has a driving vehicle, the radiator is now leaking fluid and wont start, the front is crunched in, and the other driver's vehicle doesn't have a scratch! Praise GOD!"

"event","Q: Why do I have such a hard time letting go of something that was never there?
A: There was something there. (To me)

I feel I need to let go of something I never had.

I must remember I am giving up something I want selfishly,(Lance) for someone who has asked me to let it go as he has something better for me. He is asking me to give up the one person I have ever truly loved. I asked him to show me what to do with this situation/relationship/friendship and now he has. I see it, I will now let go. He is my rock, my shelter, My comfort, he is all I need and when Im ready he will give me a man to love. The man he has chosen for me.

This is definately the most selfless thing I have ever done."

"event","last night as I walked into safeway to get things for the kids for dinner, The man ringing the Salvation Army bell said hello to me and I smiled at him, on the way out I glanced over at him and noticed him wearing a Seattle Seahawks Beanie, and I said I like your hat, and to my surprise his response was a quick thanks, I like your smile. I am not one to blush and I blushed and smiled all the way to the car and home. This man whom I did not know made my day and made me feel so good. I think I sometimes forget there are positive people out there, and people who go out of their way for other people. I just want to remember what this man did and said to me and how he made me feel in hopes that I will acknowledge people and say things that make them feel the same way."

Juanita (Nita) E. Weaver, 77 of Everett passed away surrounded by her friends and family December 12, 2006, after fighting a long battle with cancer. She was born to David and Inez Tanner on June 29, 1929 in Glendale, Arkansas. As Nita established her life, she married the love of her life Louis Weaver, on July 1, 1951. Together they raised three children, and spent 48 years of their lives together. 
Nita was known as a committed person, especially to her church, as she volunteered for many years as the treasurer of the Forest Park Seventh-Day Adventist Church. She also enjoyed reading her Bible, reading books, flowers, spending time with her loving family, and cats. 
Preceding Nita in her death was her husband, Louis Weaver. 
Nita is survived by sons, Richard Weaver and David (Wendy) Weaver; daughter, Sherri (Kevin) Miller; grandsons, Andrew, Levi, Jonathon, Shaun, Joshua and granddaughters Alicia, Breanne, Shannon.
A funeral service will be held at 1 p.m., Friday, December 15, 2006 at the Forest Park Seventh-Day Adventist Church, followed by a reception.  

You welcomed me in your home, you offered me bible studies, You were a loving, caring friend to my family and I. You were always there for me, especially during my divorce (a time I needed a friend the most) and you often prayed with and for me. I will never forget you Nita. I will see you again when we go home."

"event","I wanted more than just the infatuation,
that you found in me.
You said love was only a distraction,
that you really didn't need,
so I cried myself to sleep,
knowing the times we shared must end.
You couldn't let emotion run deep,
you said you made love to me, as a friend.

But eventually, my love,
friendships fade, too,
and I can't make love and walk away,
pretending I don't love you.
Never once did I push you away,
but everything comes to end,
so all that's left to say,
is goodbye,

I loved loving you, my friend."

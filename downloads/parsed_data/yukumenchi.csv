"event","Wheee! I finally got my own collar! It's a black leather collar with spikes and a loop ring to attatch a leash to. I bought it myself, and Katie has agreed to buy the leash. We're setting up a meeting date on monday, aka V-DAY! YAY! We're gonna meet up at the mall when I get off from school at the Macomb Mall bus stop. We're meeting by the petstore and she shall purchase the leash/chain while I supply the collar. XD I am SO naughty! My nose hurts and I woke up this morning with a tight feeling throat, and now my sinuses hurt and feel like fire somewhat. Although they did change the weather report for monday. It was supposed to be 40 degrees, now they bumbped it up to 45! Or 44, i've heard it either way. The point is that it's gonna be warmer then they originally predicted. Mike and Josh are out today, having fun. I wonder how that's going.."

"event","Hey peeps! I'm having a rather nice day so far. I've been in a very good mood lately, for the past two days. Hey, I would rather be hyper then depressed, because when I'm hyper, I'm happy. ^^ I am thinking about pushing the moving date to March instead of the predetermined May. Have I metnioned this already?? ;>.> I hope I can do it, because I and Keito-chan's 2 year anniversery sits in March, the day before my birthday, so I'm trying to push the moving date up to March. Well, today is the day to shop for luggage, and also, today is Collar Shopping Day! I've got a good collar in mind, one with a loop to attatch a chain to...>:D I'm so dirty! It's for Keito to wear as part of my bondage desire that is starting to work itself up to the surface to breach in the sunshine! She'll love it. She encourages bondage. I know because she pulled out a strap and tied it to her neck recently and handed the other end to me, and which i happily used. ;D heh heh..."

I'm thinking about pushing the move date tp March, so that me and my hunny-bun can celebrate our 2 year anniversery of dating! ^^ Wheee! I'm so tired, but I'm not complaining. Every hour spent RPing is worth the lack of sleep. Heh heh. I'm feeling another bishounen craze kicking up, and you know what that means. That means surfing the net to all corners of the yaoi universe! ^___^ I recently went out and bought myself an issue of the graphic glory ""Golden Cain"", a truly hardcore yaoi manga. VERY nice...*titter* It makes me proud and for the sake of my anime also am I seriously considering moving sooner then May. What's two months difference gonna make?..."

They happen every month...I love the dreams but they leave me hanging, so now I'm horny and restless, which for some reason is making me sad. I got a good dose of yaoi yesterday, which was refreshing for me. I'm in the mood and it makes it worse that I can't get to Katie to relieve myself. It's a little frustrating."

I will have a back up home come may. This is a great answer for me for many reasons, mostly having to do with me seeing and sleeping with Katie again! ^^ What a dream it is to be able to snuggle up without fear again like I used to, before mom interfered like she promised NOT to do...go figure her. Well, class time approaches, so I must skidaddle. I only hope it warms up enough for me to trot home from the mall after school. Believe it or not, it is faster that way, rather then waiting another hour for a bus with the homeward money I DON'T have. *sigh* Ah, well. Katie will be waiting for me online after she gets home. 3rd half day in a row, what luck. :) Can't keep her waiting ^_~

"event","Today, monday, I start more classes of the college persuasion. Math, which is a self-paced course, what I need since I haven't used math since high school, almost 2 years ago, and aerobics with my gay friends. It should be fun, getting in shape, making myself look good for Katie...teehee, just what I need. It's January. I have 3 more months to figure out what to do about a home. Maybe I can have a home for every day of the week like on Lady and the Tramp. Maybe spend days at Gf's house, another at my best bud Star's house, maybe another of a few more at an old friend of mine's house, if I can get a hold of her before then. I've known her and been her best friend since I was 6 years old, and I have been a friend of their family for about as long as well. I have helped her on several occasions and even though mom forbade us from seeing each other several years ago for reasons I will not disclose, I have been a loyal friend to her ever since I was 6, and always will be. Valentines day is a month away. I bought my girl friend a card yesterday and will go out, probably on V-day itself and get her her gifts, 2 stuffed roses at Walgreens. They're big roses, one pink and the other red. I need to convince her to walk home with me though on that day. We got lucky this year since Valentines day lands on a monday this year. This means we can exchange gifts again this year without worrying about my anti-gay mom bugging us, since she will not call during her work hours(8-5). I am sick. I have been sick since friday. I wonder if it had anything to do with me running all the way to walgreens from my house in the cold night the previous night of thursday. Could be...anyway I don't know how long I can keep up with this blasted bus schedule mom condemned me to, since she refuses to give up the car soon. I am losing my voice as well, due to this throat and lung thing I got going for me from this sickness, or whatever may be wrong with me. There is hope for me, however. There is someone selling a '94 Mercury Sable. It was advertised on a board at my mom's church. I only have less then 200$ to go for just the car. This isn't counting the insurance and crap I have to get along with it. I shall triumph soon enough with a buggy. If not, I can always get an Acura Integra, hehe, just to say that ""I own Integra""....heeheehee XD"

"event","School is here again, and I have since earned my compy abilities once more. I am long overdue for posts in this journal. Kato-san must have missed me. Many things have happened since school ended. I was caught talking with my girl friend after my(apparent)10pm chat curfew online, again.(yes, i said ""again"") Mom left me worrying myself sick(literally)with anxiety through the night and much of the next day until noon. She laid my sentance down that if I step one paw out of line again, I will be done. Gone. Homeless. In other words, she will kick me out of the house IMMEDIATELY. I'm on freakin parole in my own damn house, for cryin' out loud! I am now walking on pins and needles for that damnation. Of course, the rp continues as usual, thank god. This line of classes for school is a little less fluffy then I have taken so far. I'm just hoping that they don't prove to be too hard Today was my first class, Career Exploration. It seems like it will be usueful. I just hope my Gf thinks so too..I want to make her proud. Love you Keito-chan! :D
Well, this about wraps up my entry for today. See ya monday! Ps: Hi Kate's friend! I got your message, your reply to my previous post. Thank you so much for your entry. Hope to hear from you soon. I will add you and Kate to my 'friends list' as soon as I can figure out how to add friends to this thing. lol. The music I'm listening to now(the music noted above)sounds like it would be a good video game midi, like something from Harvest Moon, or Animal Crossings, or something cute like that. =3"

"event","""I'm hungry, but not for food.."" So much radiates from that phrase. Such power and passion, something I live in all the days of my life. I don't know what I'm feeling right now. Perhaps I'm just suffering from severe Yaoi Deficiency Syndrom, or YDS. BEWARE: This disease is serious and often debilitating unless professional assistance is consulted. Long term affects include dizziness, hallucinations and delerium, sleeplessness, incurable physical needs, which if not satisfied can lead to permintant debilitaion of the senses and the mind, as well as the deterieration of the soul. As you can see, I'm suffering, and making up for those needs is crucial for a healthy continuation of my life as it is now. I'm also finding myself suffering from my old wound: Lack of Love(r). She seems so impossible to get to now. How often can I mask my sadness with other faces? I do feel a tiny bit better since I took my legal drug, Yaoi. Viva la Yaoi. Yay. *Very monotone* T_T I wish I could get the Golden Cain yaoi manga. It's only at Oakland mall as far as I know. I wish I could sit back and read it. Take some more of my drug, drown out my sorrow, kill my pain. How much longer can I bear this sorrow and lonelyness? As I said before to someone, ""Just because I'm used to being alone doesn't mean I like it"". And that's true to be sure. I need a good role play. I haven't been able to rp since the end of November. I think I'll go mad..."

Congratulations on making Gryffindor!

Basically, you're brave, daring, chivalrous, and pretty much.. an all around good person. Of course, some see you as a goodie-two-shoes. But hey, it's true! You're really good at winning, and normally always come out as the hero. Everybody likes you.. except, maybe, the Slytherins. You're too perfect. No, really.. You're too perfect. It's annoying to watch you win, repeatedly. Oh well. Be proud anyway.

My gf put me in gryffindor for a potter movie scavenger hunt activity for a sleepover party. I guess she knows me well...and this is the first time I took the placement quiz too. I guess I really do belong there. She's in slytherin(probably spelled that wrong) but that's ok. She's still my girl ^^
 Oh and by the way, my smurf name generator gave me the name ""Waspinator Smurf"". I gave Keito's name a go-go, and she came out as ""New-and-Improved Smurf"", which is interesting. >_>"

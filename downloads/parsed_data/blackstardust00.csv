"event","it's funny how you think you know who your true friends are then they try to steal your identity and best friend.whats next, i mean she keeps stabbing me in the back...does she even realize what she is doing, does she realize i'm getting pissed off, i'm finally starting to get some good stuff in my life, feel like there is a reason to live. but i fee llike all of that is getting taken away from me, one after another, then i'l be back to my true depressed self doing some stuip[d shit just to make myself feel better, even if it's just for a slpit second any moment of happyness would be nice rightnow but i'm not getting any of that enstead i get a ""friend"" stabbing me in the back repeadidly until i'm so down there is nothing to pick me up. i don't even know if she realizes she's doing this. but she is and no one will know what it does to me, how i feel until it happens or it's over.some time i just wish i could sish all thius away to where i'd be happy with my life and not always feel like a failier, but thats all i am a depressed little child with many prob. that no one knows about because i hide it, and don't let it out. i'm just a screw-up ( it feels like) that is never goig to be good enough for anyone . i wonder if my life is ever going to get better. for a while i thogut it was. but out of all that all i got is my best friend. it's amazing how ppl; your friends can just stab you in the back. i never thought she would do this to me, but she did....thats one more reason for me to not be able to trust anyone. i've know her sinse like 2nd grade if not longer,i always expect the worsebut i never expected this....i mean this person....she's done some stupid shit to me but i never thought this, or maybe i have.i feel so alone like i can't trust anyone, but i guess that happpends when someone you thougth was a ""true"" friend, or close to it does something like this and stabs you in the back it's almost like she is trying to steal my identity she used to be a quiet prep ghetter girl who never more make- up and the day after i slept over she's doing everthing the same as me, wearing the same thing saying the same thing make-up the same now she's taking my crush, my ex, and tryn to get my best friend.....i don't know what to think, theres just so much shit going on, it seems like i just don't know hwo to handle it, whether to cry, be mad...i just don't know anymore, i just feel so alone..."

"event","finally i figured out how to use this fuckin thing,i'm so slow i needed help from amanda....i'm so tired, but i just can't seem to sleep lately, for whatever reason. who knows but it fuckin sucks, maybe it's the fact that i no longer have cutting to turn to as a let out..so now i just have so much fuckin shit just flyin around in my head and it's affecting my sleep time, which is not helping right now bcuz with school starting and having to wake up at 5:45 am and sit at the shit hole they call midpark...i hate that fuckin place and everyone in it i just wish everyone there would die. i'd love to kill have the ppl there, i'm waiting for someone to just start shit with me and run their mouth and get in my face so i can just beat their ass, i think that would take alot of anger out!

things aren't going good with one of my friends either, found out shes pregnant...last thing she needs right about now she's younger than me, she's 15..thats sad, even though it's from her boyfriend. thats the last hing she needs her mom already hates her she got caught for cutting and has to see a physiologist..she's gettin an abortion soon, i just don't know when i wish i could make everything better for her, i dotn' fuckin care about me just as long as she's okay, i dunno whats going to happen to her after all this has settled down

2 more days still school starts! yippy  *looks around with a sarcastic look on face* i'm just waiting to see if i'm actually going to freak on someone at school and just kick their ass, there are so many ppl that i already know i wanna kill just by the looks of them, is it bad that i think about killing ppl so much, i really try not to be a violent person...what can i say, i get it from my dad...:/

and to think i can't even leave the journal at the 3 sections i need to make a fourth bcuz i have a thing with odd numbers...i have so many issues!"

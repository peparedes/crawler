"event","So the last week or so has kept me pretty busy building. Of five total projects I'm back to two and a half.. I WAS working on a castle for Taessa, my Darkwoods booth, FURNI in Kissling with Cat Omega, the Sunset Cafe and of course Theater Parnasse in Nexus Prime. Well now the Sunset Cafe is gone (needed the cash AND I have a lot more land there now, so I'm going to rebuild), the castle has to be put on hold or I'll go nuts, and FURNI is of course a joint venture, so it's an on-again-off-again kind of deal.

This leaves me to focus on Parnasse; it was going to be a HUGE ass place way up in the air, but I feel the taxes would kill me financially. I'll eventually bump it up there again, but I wasn't pleased with how the build was progressing, and without a means to make it look like such a large, obviously concrete-composed area was suspended some 150 ft in the air without anything more than a large steel-reinforced glass tube -- I wasn't buying it!  

With such a limited space to work inside of, that sort of thing will have to wait.  I don't mind the limits, but I'm going to work within the space I'm provided instead of creating a monster that shouldn't physically be possible. I know it's just a game, and that certain architectural prinicples will never truly prevail, but it was much more asthetic than that.

A similar situation is occuring in the Darkwoods build, but.. I knew what I was getting into there. Mostly if I had a meter to either side of the booth, I'd be alright.. and as it stands I could probably extend things a /tiny/ bit in one direction and get away with it. I'd have to speak to Ama about that first, of course.  So far I have made a tiefling Avatar for that site (I'll including a link to the screenshots page instead of just posting them here from now on), and  a few tiny magical/alchemical accoutriments.  My particular point of pride on this build is a stuffed immature green dragon head. Took me about four hours to complete, but it was well worth it. I should have gotten a screenwhot of him as well, ah me.

So other than all this building and pondering the sending of a resume for a Liaison position.. that's been about it.  Lots of interesting things going on all over the place, it's really a pity I have no time or money for all of them at the moment -- but there is always the future!"

"event","That's about how I feel as of late.

Flip-flop. Work on my Nexus Prime building. Flip-flop. Ooo another AV to do! Flip-flop. Hm, I better close down the cafe for a while.. now wait, I'm opening it back up again! Flip-flop, flip-flop, flip-flop.

This is the one 'problem' I have with Second Life. SMTDSLT Syndrome.. in other words, my interests are getting pretty broad. I'm not QUITE feeling stretched thin, but some days I feel like I'm being more talkative than productive. Which is not a BAD thing, but.. I like to be continuous in my efforts!

Anyway.. been encouraging Tyrell Corporation to take over the Atlas Casino as of tonight. I think it would be a RIOT to own that place.."

"event","Yeah so I finally got my computer straightened out. I think. <ponders> It only took six tries to install it -- who knew that converting to NTFS would cause so much trouble? Now I wonder if I should try it after XP is installed? Seems like last time I did that, I had more headaches.

As for SL stuff, well.. the Kissling project is temporarily scratched. I wasn't feeling the building. How odd that I get invited to the TC City Planners group now, and I'm having a bitch of a time trying to get my ideas out.  I want to do something partially open air, partially HUGE fuggin' tower. But how does one make the two ideas coalesce? Eh.

Taking down the pictures in the other posts so as not to make this a horrid download. Eeep, shame on me.  From now on I'll just link them."

"event","So the last couple of days, I've been busy working on my Pier 1 Imports knockoff in Kissling, where I have joined the Kissling Island Community. Of course, I'm building right next to Lynnix Muse and Ysg Leviathan, so the pressure is really on to create something spectacular.

Right now, I'm not so sure I'm achieving that.

My Sunset Cafe build is unique; I don't believe I have seen anything even remotely like an adobe building in game, though I know folks (bp for example) have considered it. If I want to be the FLW of SL, the question is, how do I go about making something so incredibly different that it's going to be talked about and/or remembered for some time to come?

Well my new sound card and video card are NOT helping my creative process one bit, that's for sure. The last two days I have poked, prodded, biten, hit, kicked and suckerpunched my system time and time again. I think I have installed and uninstalled my video card drivers a total of 10 times now, hoping to get something to work right. And of course just a bit ago, I stumbled across the idea that it was my sound card that's causing all the trouble. I took out my GF4 and put the GF2 back in, and -- go figure, I crashed. Can I get a FUCK NO? <sighs>

So instead of having the leisure to really focus on my new build, I've been pouring most of my energy into this machine. Everything was FINE before, but no, not now.. and if it's my sound card causing all this I'm going to have a spaz. Like, right in front of the cat and my fiance.  The heavens will part and lightning will strike the ground.. because if it was something so clear and I didn't see it all this time..  Pity is, I can't test my theory IN SL until tomorrow.  If this doesn't work, I'm so reformating.....

Ahem, enough ranting.  I'm going to go uninstall and reinstall another driver now.."

"event","So this is a little off topic given that the subject of my journal is about SL, but I have to bitch: there is a construction effort going on RIGHT outside my window. For a pool. So I'm listening to a fucking LOT of noise, only to listen to more noise (ie: kids, drunks) when they get it all done. I'm thinking it might be fun to flick cigarette butts into it when everything is done and clog the filters, so they have to close it down regularly. Yeah! No not really.. but I can fantasize.

So anyway, onto the more germane stuff..

I've been trying to learn how to script on and off since I started back in March. And boy. Did I start having fun yesterday. Scripted doors, scripted note card givers, scripted talking unicorns, scripted landmark givers.. and I know this is just the dinky stuff, but it's highly amusing to me.  I can only imagine what sort of fun I'm going to have once I actually figure out how things beyond state_entry and so on work..

Also been playing with custom avatars as of yesterday.  Made Radical Edward and Julia from Cowboy Bebop... Julia was giving me a really rough time, but only because of the hair. The first time I tried to make all those wavy curls, they looked like various-sized loaves of french bread glued together. I knew I was going in somewhat the right direction, but it just was not good enough for my tastes. I know if I stick to it I can make things come out right, and so I keep at it. 

Spent some time hanging out with Cat & Hamlet, talking, poking, trying.... Eventually Hamlet logs, and then Cat crashed, so I didn't have anyone to distract myself with talking to and I got all hard core. I went from smushed spheres to warped torii, and before I knew it I was on to something.  I'll get a screenie up of that soon.... 77 prims for ONE accessory is probably a bit excessive, but it looks frigging COOL so I'm keeping it.

Did I get the Merry Go Round done in time? Heh, no. After I give Evie her building lesson tonight I'm going to try to pound it out, but I am not sure if I will have enough time to finish it all."

"event","Lately I have been rather busy getting to bed at what I'm forcing my brain to deem as a 'decent' time. Usually any hour before 3am. This of course means, I'm pretty much either playing SL, doing something for it or working on something in my REAL home right up until then, and I just don't feel up to writing.  So bear with me here.

Mostly a lot of building going on lately, and that's about it. I took down the Moon, tried to rebuild it attached to my shared house in Lusk, got bored and took it all down again.  So now I have this NEW place in Shipley, right next to Catherine Omega & Bel Muse. This is probably my dream location, as it's all sun and sea. As a result, my creative energies have been up and I have built what I coin as something that is 'neo mediterranian'. In a word, it's gorgeous.

I'm not patting myself on the back, but for once I'm actually PLEASED with my creation. It's not a box, it's not like anything I have ever seen in game, and people like it. Airy, spacious, calming.. everything a hangout should be. And damnit, it's going to be a hangout. Welcome to the Sunset Cafe. Screenshots forthcoming.

The whole deal with the guys in Camp Jessie has almost completely blown over. Mostly they stick to their place, come out on occasion for events, and overall seem to be either loving the game or returning to WWIIO. Either way, things are primarily peaceful once again.

I decided to step back from it all the other day, removing myself from both factions and taking up the reins on other projects that I deem more worthy, like my property and creating fun things for the game. And if I don't get cracking I'm NEVER going to have the Merry-Go-Round finished in time for Ama's Arcade grand opening!

Tonight is my first night in the regular teaching slot I've taken over since Phaylen left the game. I'm really sad to see her go, but I think DAOC sucked her back in again and I can't blame her. It's a fun game! Just.. not what I'm looking for right now. I've taught twice before, so this should be a sinch.. but you never know what can happen."

"event","Wednesday night, Second Life was invaded by a pack of folks from World War II Online.  Damage was done, and now there is this.. rift between some of the alpha/closed beta testers and our 'n00bs'.  I'm feeling a little stuck in the middle as I have made friends with several of them and wish to see them stay, but I also understand how my fellow closed beta testers are a little disgruntled by all this.

The rest of this entry probably won't make a whole hell of a lot of sense unless you are one of the few SL people that caught on to my address somehow.  Let's just say I'm too mm.. polite to post this where Linden employees who think of me highly might see it.  But I HAVE to get it out of my system:

<i>So I'm sitting here kind of wondering to myself why I bothered to check out the WWIIO forums.  Morbid curiosity I guess... maybe I felt because of our recent influx of new players, it would be fun to see what kind of things they posted about their 'adventures' in Second Life.

Boy do I wish I hadn't now.

First off, I want someone to tell Lock a few things: I'm pretty sure at least MOST of we women that play aren't ""400 pound moustached butt scratchers"" and can state with quite a bit of enthusiasm that I am no ""hippy"" -- maybe you missed the bit about my enjoyment of in-game firearms in the Outlands. Maybe you haven't a clue about who we really are and because no one is willing to see the clear issue here, you're going to go ahead and assume what you wish since it's the most amusing course of action to you. To hell with anyone else.

I notice that the people who aren't being griefers (and oh yes, with your attitudes about your fellow gamers who are not choosing to SOLELY participate in combat-play I would call you that indeed), are the ones who know how to construct thought processes without the use of the dubious word 'pwned'.. who are trying to check the game out and see it's full potential instead of just running around with guns and hitting on ""chix"".  I hope they stay. 

With the amount of people have, we can run the Outland sims into the ground testing it out for the Lindens, we don't need a mess of holier-than-j00 fatigue-wearing mother fuckers running around offing people for no reason whatsoever other than 'they can'. I know that there are not so many doing this, but those that are.. watch your asses.  People aren't going to stand by even in the 'suburbanized' Outlands and let you behave like spoiled children with new toys forever.</i>

Kinda hollow huh? And to think I actually cared if they stuck around at first.. now I just want like.. two of them to stay. The rest can go play their little MDK game."

"event","So here I am, end of week two in SL.

I'm starting to notice a lot of interesting things for the first time, things that have been in my face all along:

First of course, would be TeamSpeak. I got plugged into that and played around a bit, all very interesting and fun but it causes a lot of lag because my system isn't exactly an AWESOME UBER GAMER BOX. But that's okay.. one can only chat so much before they get utterly distracted from the world and the people in it. Definitely a fun tool for competitive games, however.

Second would be the above mentioned games. I finally got around to attending sports events and PARTICIPATING. Yeah, I didn't stutter. I actually had FUN playing something that required me to whack people off of catwalks and fly around bumping a big blue ball. Enough so that I decided to get to work on my OWN game. And that brings me to my third and final 'discovery'.

Scripting! Initial impressions: it be evil.  Not being a mathematically inclined sort (as it seems so many of the MEN that play this game are), I'm balking a little bit as I read the beginners guide. Those who know me well will recall I have a stubborn streak, yes? So I'm going to give it a shot. If I'm not amused in a reasonable amount of time, out it goes! It's not like there aren't dozens of talented scripters already.

Things have been pretty calm overall the last couple of days, aside from my adventuring.  After yesterday's fiasco involving getting the elevator up and running and having to hire bouncers to keep out the riff-raff (see: griefers with rockets and guns) things got constructive.  Mark Busch was able to implement what is probably THE coolest elevator in game at the coffeehouse -- and this after I had resigned myself to a staircase.

Since it was Tax Day yesterday, Governor Linden also opened up a competition where you wrote to him why you should get some sort of tax relief and you better believe I did, going into great detail about my situation and A Day In the Life of a Builder in the Outlands.. which was pretty amusing if I do say so myself.

Decided to tear down the texture shop for now, and as luck would have it, Phaylen has graciously offered to allow me to put my little blocks up in her shop. So YAY. I'd be happy just to cover the $1500 in uploading bills!

Seeing as how tomorrow is stipend day, I'll get to add some major additions to the coffeehouse by way of furniture. I'd managed to find some objects already made for free at the Furniture Superstore, but the cost involved on the amount of prims these things take to rez is horrendous. Beautiful work on Alberto Linden's part, but I'm going to make my own demmit."

"event","WOW. I sure got a lot done tonight.. made a counter, some nice little cannisters, stools,  finished putting together most of the gallery.. I'm impressed with myself!

It's still a pretty square building, but I think on the whole with the bubble dome windows that glow a cheery red into the wee hours of the morning and the rather interesting internal layout, it's got character. And while I appreciate the compliments I get, I think if I hear the word ambience one more time I'm going to go ballistic and play with my gun bracelet again. 

No seriously.. I must have hit something on the head; people really dig the wooden beams and reddish brick thing going on.  I threw in a little chrome for a modern splash, and it's working well.  The only thing I am not sure I like, ironically enough, is the porch I saved from my first construction attempt.

Did I remember to get screenshots this time? HELL NO. I was too busy being a worker bee and there is STILL so much to be done.. all sorts of different furniture needs to go in, I need to arrange for artists to get their things into the gallery, so on and so forth. And I'm only a tiny bit finished with the landscaping, oy.

Short and sweet post tonight.. I hear a book calling my name."

"event","..because I've been busy building for the past two days.

And I thought things were going to be easy, hah. No, no.. far from it. But I continue to learn, and the coffeehouse is looking MUCH more fleshed out this time.  The walls actually look like walls, and not pieces of paper suspending in thin air. The building itself has character. I will get screens tomorrow, I PROMISE.

Spent most of the day throwing up first floor walls, deciding how to do windows and the like.. and then I pulled out the Evil Trampoline (TM), whereupon many people were suddenly there with me, jumping up and down and falling HARD when they were sent a little too high up.  See, this thing was originally designed to be just a little jumper, but I made it bigger, and that seems to have increased its capacity for distance.  Hilarity ensued as we jumped and laughed, and I even started to cry I was laughing so hard.  Nothing like going waaaaaaaaay up, only to come down with a huge splat and then find myself at my bind point because it toasted my health rating.

Shortly thereafter, Sassy Apple showed up with something called the 'bunny shoe'.. which looks like a deceptively innocent pinky bunny slipper. The minute you took a step, however, it made a 'boooiii-oii-oiing' noise and shot you up a good hundred feet in the air.  Unfortunately the effects didn't combine with the trampoline, and eventually the sound got on my nerves, so I went back to building.

Man I love this game.

My friend and the founder of the group, Form Over Function (to which I belong), Dionysus had been around for a while at this point, and when I started playing around with the landscape and made a new pond (the old one sucked, it's so gone) he got the idea of altering the ||burn script to make it look like steam coming off the water. 

And so the Moonsprings were born, complete with palm trees, rocks, a smattering of white flowers and several three foot tall ferny-looking trees.  A lovely touch really, and we spent some time playing with that while Tyrath and Yuki were visiting.

Aside from all this, I did a bit of socializing, received the gift of a well-scripted stereo system from my friend Darkwave for the coffeehouse, and made the purchase of a western call-girl outfit from the wonderful Taessa Weaver, tailored and colored (black) just as I wanted it.  She's gotten rather eager to help with the western-themed community, Oak Grove, and I think she's planning on working on that more than her clothing.. I might just help her, if I don't get involved with DarkWood. So many things I want to do! I can't see how anyone could ever be bored playing Second Life.

So anyway, that about wrapped up my day, for as I was posing for a picture with Taessa in our matching dresses, the game crashed -- right at 11pm, when the login server goes down. Bugger."

"event","Just a quick entry (haha yeah right) to cap the evening's events.. I have a date with my new stained-glass program, Spike Spiegel and Faye Valentine!

First major happening of the evening was getting together with Vershean (the up and coming furniture designer I bitched about two posts down) and making amends. Sure, she's only 18 and a little spastic, but a good kid and we were able to make repairs on our current situation and might even become friends. If she stops threatening to spoon out her eye. <peers>

As for Mr. Lagtower? He got BANNED for being such a fuckhead! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

Side thought: do all 80s stations only have about 100 songs that they play over and over? I swear I hear ths same songs every night.

Second major happening was my decision to definitely continue with the coffeehouse project, regardless of whether or not I get excepted into the DarkWood community.  In fact, I'm a little AFRAID of being accepted because of that HIGHLY EVIL wishing well that Nexus Nash made. <shudders> It keeps making me pay it too much money.. thank god tomorrow is pay day!

Oh yeah, also having an event on May 1st provided nothing important comes up RL: a SOCIAL MIXER, whoo! The main event of the night is an avatar contest, with a few sub-events to do a little suspense building. Lindens are already telling me I'll make a great mentor.. so I decided to FURTHER my ego by ingratiating myself to a majority of the creative population in game! That's right, I'm going to see just how popular I get just for the hell of it.  They'll be telling Lyra Legends for months to come after the game goes gold! <evil cackle>

As for actually being literally constructive (haha, little builder joke there), I got the pond fairly well landscaped and gave the porch a makeover.  New stained glass windows are in and the front of the house has begun.. it's all pretty easy from here on out, just a matter of putting the walls, floors, staircases and so on in properly.  Might even make a couple of drawings so things go a little more smoothly.  And I'm doing MATH... oh the world is coming to an end, it is forseen!

This game is definitely tapping my creative potential, UNLIKE The Sims Online where I just sat around getting frustrated after the first week. Yes, I really loved watching skills slip while I raised another and being assured repeatedly that I would be allowed to make things for the game only to NEVER SEE IT HAPPEN.

"event","Hm, almost a week has passed since I started. Well technically, more than a week.. but we won't count the Johny days.

So far things have been pretty fun. In my attempt to build the Ruby Moon Coffeehouse, I learned a great deal about the grid system and how NOT to build. It was looking like a prettily textured house of cards towards the end, and the only thing worth salvaging was the porch. Two hours on the staircase ALONE.. it's all gone now! <sobs>

Still, I was getting annoyed that my lovely view of the ocean was blocked. One of the man things about building where Sassy and I bought land was because of the view, and Bobby came out of nowhere and started building.. fortunately his house is pretty cool, and even though my land faces out to the server edge (I bought it STRAIGHT up to the line, that'll last until they release a new sim at least), I'm sure it will make a nice view once he is done.

Meanwhile I'm dealing with a variety of idiots and becoming a little less enchanted with the whole game each day. Aren't these people supposed to be 18 years old and over? Hah! Well, if anything I should remember that at 18, you are by no means an adult mentally, just considered one by the government.

Most recently were my multiple run-ins with a self-titled 'up and coming' furniture designer, who frankly does not hold a candle to Malaer's wonderful work. I'll get some screens up of that soon, but in the meantime..

This chick keeps coming to events and asking people over and over and over to buy her stuff. Like handing out her calling card and landmark isn't enough right? They are amateur pieces at best, and most of the people she is asking could probably do much better with fewer braincells than they currently have.  Maybe it's just PMS, but holy damn I wanted to shoot her with my gun bracelet.  Especially after Darwin's event tonight.. was frustrated enough that the way he ran things was a little whacked out, and he kept asking us to play his money game even though it seemed to work more in his favor than the rest of ours... <sighs>

Then there was this guy who built the Tower o' LAG right smack in the middle of Shipley, which is already pretty laggy due to overly huge buildings with mucho animation effects going on.  I think it's time to open new sims!  While Dave's attempt to quell this monstrousity worked (nothing like a big, BIG black box with the words Ugly Buildings crossed out in a big red circle covering it to make a statement), a bitter taste has been left in my mouth over the whole affair. The guy apologized to Dave only, even though others were trying to put aside their differences over the matter and make amends.  Some people's kids....

At any rate, while I'm having fun MOST of the time right now, I'm definitely not going to be paying for this game.  The overall concept is really cool, and I'm sure I'll enjoy the hours I log into making sure things work right, but when it goes gold I'm going to hightail it out of there and get on with something else."

Finally got my OWN account approved today, so I went about seeking a place to display and sell some of my original drawings. Phaylen was kind enough to offer me space, and she gets some free art on the walls, plus anything she wants done in the future for no charge. Rent is still cheap it seems!

While the contacts were definitely a hit, I was disappointed to discover someone else already had them going in the marketplace. Bleh! Four hours down the drain.. though it is nice to know I can make whatever I want. Might take a bash at something I've been meaning to try for a cool outfit I'm thinking of."

"event","So some ideas are running through my head tonight. I'm up late as I'm vaguely perturbed at having a minor glitch and not being able to return as a result of it.

Doesn't seem to me that a lot of people are making eyes.. sure, you can have strange colors in the game, and all that jazz.. but what about contacts with designs in them?  So my quest has begun.  I'm not sure if they will work correctly and I have about 12 hours until I can find out for sure, but in the meantime I'm content to work with my muse and create.

So far I have three basics, two of which I'm going to alter just a bit. Things are looking GREAT.

If I can manage it, I'll start a store eventually. Maybe in the meantime Billie can put them up in her boutique or something. Will have to ask tomorrow."

"event","Oh. So here's my incredible story. Yes, this is an incredible story, for real.

So, it all starts out with my friend and I going to get drinks at this new bar in East Memphis on the Friday night before last. We sit at the bar next to this dude who looks pretty clean cut and normal (after all, we are in a good part of town). He starts talking to us and pretty much ends up telling us his whole life story in two hours. Apparently he is married to a woman much younger than him and she and him had a child. But they must have had a falling out because she files a restraining order against him and he is charged with THREE assault charges. Now, he says SHE assaulted HIM, but of course my friend and I are skeptical. Finally this guys tells a racist joke, I call him out on it, and my friend decides it is time to go. We make sure he doesn't follow us out to our car. 
Here is where the story gets interesting. Apparently, the Saturday a week later this guy goes in to Willie Moffats in Bartlett, finds his wife having dinner with another man, and SHOOTS her in the back, killing her. He then turned the gun on himself, shooting himself in the chest. Both die. The five witnesses and the wife's boyfriend are unharmed.

This story has been all over the news in Memphis, and it is definitely the same guy my friend and I talked to at the bar that night. I just can't believe I talked to a murderer the week before he committed a murder suicide inside a popular Bartlett restaurant. We've seen his picture. It IS the same guy. Their poor fucking kid now has no parents. Look up the recent news on John Shelton in The Commercial Appeal if you are curious.

FUCKING CRAZY."

"event","So I've been totally trying to change my karma. I want to always help others and see how it could possibly help me in return. For example, I drove the 45 minutes out to my mother's apartment to change her smoke alarm battery because it was beeping incessantly, and while I was there I cleaned her catbox, did her dishes, and took out her trash. And guess what? The next day, I found a one hundred dollar bill on the stairs in my office building. Cool, huh? Also, I have been extremely helpful to the sales people at work, trying to turn over their orders in less than one work day. And they really appreciate it! I even got a Christmas present from one of them! And the other day I found a lucky penny on the ground and used it on a lottery ticket...after I held the door at the gas station for a crippled lady. I didn't win anything on the ticket, but I still felt great just because. And my best friend and my sister have been seeking my advice lately, and it makes me feel good that they put a little stock in what I think, because I love them both very much. I want to always live my life like this. I want to help others and feel great about it. Changing my karma is my number one goal. Happy Holidays all you sexy bitches. Hugs and kisses. You are all fabulous!"

"event","1. I voted for Kerry because I believe we do need more troops and aid in Iraq in order to get the fuck out of there quicker.
2. I voted for Kerry because I do NOT support a gay marriage ban. (While I was still a little perturbed about his lack of conviction on the issue, at least he didn't say that he doesn't know if people choose to be gay or not. He came right out and said that people do NOT choose to be gay)
3. I voted for Kerry because I do NOT want supreme court justices appointed who might reverse Roe vs. Wade. This election was about our rights, which have been trampled on during the Bush dynasty. 
4. I voted for Kerry because I believe he would have worked hard to gain back a little respect for us in the eyes of the rest of the world. In fact, I believe that he was extremely passionate about doing this. 
5. I voted AGAINST Bush because I believe he went to war for money, which is just despicable and incomprehensible.
6. I voted AGAINST Bush because I cringe every time he TRIES to speak.
7. I voted for Kerry because he proposed expansive and well-thought-out plans for Health Care, unlike Bush, who just wants us all to pay for it out of our own pockets with a ""savings account"". Yeah, that works great for rich people, but what about me?
8. I voted for Kerry because I believe his wife would have pushed environmental issues and worked to protect our air, trees, etc. WAY more than Bush ever did or would. And I think Laura Bush is weak and uninspiring, especially when compared to Hillary Clinton and Teresa Kerry.
9. I voted against Bush because I believe that the moral values he congratulates himself for having are completely bogus. I think that he believes that Christianity is better than other religions and wants to vigorously push the Christian faith into the White House and on nations of people around the world, which I think, above all else, is exceedingly dangerous. I think he confuses traditional Christian values and the concept of freedom, especially when he refers to Middle Eastern leaders as ""evil"" and such. It just worries me. I don't think Kerry is such a fundamentalist, or as others might say, ""simple"". The language that Bush uses is based on fear, hate, and stupidity.
10. I watched all three debates, and decided on my own that Kerry did a much better job, made more sense, had better ideas for our country, conducted himself with grace, and displayed superior intelligence."

So I've decided to add more onto this. I just need some place to get it all out. I have a big problem with the way I feel right now. I feel like I cannot look or talk to anyone who I think might have voted that scum back into office. If I do look at them, I might scream ""You fucking ignorant fuck! How could you buy into the bullshit? Don't you have a fucking brain of your own? Are you so brainwashed by Bush's conservative media that you are a fucking voting robot? You must actually believe the shit you hear on FoxNews. You are afraid that if Kerry is elected, you won't be able to drive around your SUV in peace because you will be accosted by flying gay people with wedding bands? You think your stupid idiotic church might lose its tax breaks and you won't have anywhere to go to bask in all-white, straight, patriotic (snort) glory while you pat yourselves on the back for being god-fearing? Do you actually want your jobs to go overseas? Oh wait, those aren't YOUR jobs. Why should you care about the working class jobs? Better to keep the poor people in their place, huh? Some of you voted for George-fucker-Bush because ""you work hard, and you don't want the government taking your money and giving it to 'deadbeats' with no job"". You dumbasses. Have you ever traveled outside of rural Ohio, TN, or TX? Have you ever seen a place outside of suburbia? I bet you are actually scared to travel into The City (gasp!). Do you have any idea how many heads are shaking around the world????? Wake up you fucks! George Bush is not a 'nice guy'! George Bush is NOT ""just like my grandpa"". Give me a fucking break. He is the Leader of the Elite. He is mentally-challenged, and a pawn of Cheney. Jesus fucking h-christ you stupid retards!!!""

That is what I feel like saying. But I won't. I'll just say it here. But I don't feel any better."

"event","After close inspection, I have determined that the glob on the floor in
my hallway is half of a mouse. Yes, that's right folks, half of a
mouse. I thoroughly questioned the cats in an attempt to wrangle out a
confession, but they were completely silent on the issue. George,
however, was looking pretty guilty, so he is the culprit, I'm quite
sure of it. And there is this morbid green slime seeping out of the
abdomen, which makes me exceeding sick to my tummy. I guess if we end
up having mice, at least we have a rodent-killer only too happy to tear
the vermin to shreads. Nice.<br>
<br>
Can't wait to vote tomorrow. I am dying to watch 24-hour conservative-woe on TV. Fun fun!<br>


My party was cool. Not as many folks showed up as I would have liked, but it was one of those nights with lots of shit to do. I did have a puker, though! Now I am hitting up my bar, because it is nicely stocked! =)


<br>
In other news, because I work at a radio station, I tend to surf
channels quite frequently to size up the copywriting competition, and I
stumbled upon the most god-awful song I have ever heard, of course,
playing on 94.1 the buzz. So I called the hotline to find out name of
said song, and it turns out, it's none other than Josh Kelly's
""Everybody Wants You"". (who the fuck is Josh Kelly?). Not only was it
horrible and the lyrics absolutely pathetic (I was wondering if my
seven-year-old brother wrote it), he fucking stole a song title from
Jeff Buckley. (OK, so Jeff's song does have a ""Here"" in the title, but still).
Fucker. John Kelly, I mean, Josh Kelly, you suck BIG TIME. And what was
so funny was that I told the dude who picked up the hotline that the
song sucked, and he completely agreed with me, said it was horrible,
and then called me baby. In other music news....<br>
<br>
<lj-cut text=""New York Times bashes real music lovers everywhere""><br>

Personally, I am sick of the fucking overproduced pop-stars. Sorry if I
have a little taste, you stupid probable Bush-supporter. Bah!<br>

<p>As what, exactly? The online verdict came fast and harsh, the way online verdicts
usually do. A typical post on her Web site bore the headline, ""Ashlee you
are a no talent fraud!"" After that night, everyone knew that Jessica
Simpson's telegenic sister was no rock 'n' roll hero - she wasn't even a rock
'n' roll also-ran. She was merely a lip-synching pop star.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p>Music critics have a word for this kind of verdict, this knee-jerk backlash
against producer-powered idols who didn't spend years touring dive bars. Not a
very elegant word, but a useful one. The word is rockism, and among the small
but extraordinarily pesky group of people who obsess over this stuff, rockism
is a word meant to start fights. The rockism debate began in earnest in the
early 1980's, but over the past few years it has heated up, and today, in
certain impassioned circles, there is simply nothing worse than a rockist.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p>A rockist isn't just someone who loves rock 'n' roll, who goes on and on
about Bruce Springsteen, who champions ragged-voiced singer-songwriters no one
has ever heard of. A rockist is someone who reduces rock 'n' roll to a
caricature, then uses that caricature as a weapon. Rockism means idolizing the
authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star;
lionizing punk while barely tolerating disco; loving the live show and hating
the music video; extolling the growling performer while hating the lip-syncher.
<o:p></o:p></p>


<p>Over the past decades, these tendencies have congealed into an ugly sort of
common sense. Rock bands record classic albums, while pop stars create
""guilty pleasure"" singles. It's supposed to be self-evident: U2's
entire oeuvre deserves respectful consideration, while a spookily seductive
song by an R&amp;B singer named Tweet can only be, in the smug words of a
recent VH1 special, ""awesomely bad.""<o:p></o:p></p>


<p>Like rock 'n' roll itself, rockism is full of contradictions: it could mean
loving the Strokes (a scruffy guitar band!) or hating them (image-conscious
poseurs!) or ignoring them entirely (since everyone knows that music isn't as
good as it used to be). But it almost certainly means disdaining not just Ms.
Simpson but also Christina Aguilera and Usher and most of the rest of them,
grousing about a pop landscape dominated by big-budget spectacles and
high-concept photo shoots, reminiscing about a time when the charts were packed
with people who had something to say, and meant it, even if that time never
actually existed. If this sounds like you, then take a long look in the mirror:
you might be a rockist.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p>Countless critics assail pop stars for not being rock 'n' roll enough,
without stopping to wonder why that should be everybody's goal. Or they reward
them disproportionately for making rock 'n' roll gestures. Writing in The
Chicago Sun-Times this summer, Jim DeRogatis grudgingly praised Ms. Lavigne as
""a teen-pop phenom that discerning adult rock fans can actually admire
without feeling (too) guilty,"" partly because Ms. Lavigne ""plays a
passable rhythm guitar"" and ""has a hand in writing"" her songs. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p>Rockism isn't unrelated to older, more familiar prejudices - that's part of
why it's so powerful, and so worth arguing about. The pop star, the disco diva,
the lip-syncher, the ""awesomely bad"" hit maker: could it really be a
coincidence that rockist complaints often pit straight white men against the
rest of the world? Like the anti-disco backlash of 25 years ago, the current
rockist consensus seems to reflect not just an idea of how music should be made
but also an idea about who should be making it. <o:p></o:p></p>

<P>5. Invest in property: a house on the bluffs downtown, and a house on a beach somewhere. maybe a house in the mountains.</P>
<P>6. Donate to charities: neighborhood development programs, aids research, and lobby for stem cell research.</P>
<P>7. Travel the world. Africa, Japan, India, Europe</P>

<P>9. Go on a shopping spree in Manhattan, catch a few shows, and hang out in the clubs with the celebrities </P>

Hahahahahahahahahah! Look at this picture of Bush whenever you need a laugh!

So we went out last night and I ended up drinking two car bombs along with various beers, and I am still hungover. But at least I made it in to work. Tonight is dedicated to completely vegging out on the couch. I am going to Blockbuster to see if I can rent dead like me in the hopes that I might find another show to obsess over. But first, I am going to watch sex and the city season 6 while x is still at work. No Friday happy hour for me...I need a break! And I'm broke! Completely fucking scraping the bottom of my wallet for one last dollar. This weekend shall be drink-free for the most part. Gotta take my old clothes to goodwill tomorrow, and then x and I are going to the wonders exhibit. Should be interesting. Anyways, just wanted to update and post those hilarious pictures."

Yeah! Yall want me to post. Ok, ok, ok....;)

Started Job A Weightloss Challenge today. From what I hear, this has not been a very successful venture in the past, but hey, it's worth a shot. And I'm out twenty bucks October 14th if I don't make my projected weight. So wish me luck.

One Month Goal Weight: 1Y0 lbs
Today's Weigh-In: 1Y8.5 lbs
To Lose: 8.5 lbs

Ultimate Goal: 1N2 lbs
Total Weight To Lose: 16.5 lbs

Maybe if I lose this weight, my last year's jeans will fit me. I tried to put them on this morning and couldn't even yank them past my thighs. Ewww."

My proposal for radio advertising at Job A was finally acknowledged, even though it took a consultant to notice it. Met with the big dogs at CC. Totally held my own. I AM the shit today. 

Going to happy hour with a good old friend. 

Gonna get a little smoke on and relax with a martini and some girl chatter. Life's pretty good today. 

Also, downloaded Jeff Buckley's last goodbye as my wireless ring tone! The recording sucks, but hey, I have Jeff singing to me every time my phone rings! 

No regular Job B today, not counting the meeting earlier for Job A with Job B. I know that makes no sense, but let's just say that I am definately putting some networking skills to use! And I'm leaving at 5! WOOOO HOOOOO!

Ok. That's about it.  Yes, I am aware that I am a big fat nerd. =P"

"event","<P>So I went to my grandparents' tonight for dinner to return some speeches I revised for my grandpa. (He makes speeches from time to time for varies functions) Here is an actual conversation that happened at the dinner table tonight. I assure you, both were oblivious to the obvious connotations. </P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6600>""<STRONG>Dear, this meat's tough. Did you beat it? My mother used to beat our meat.""</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff>""Honey, you don't have to do that anymore...they beat it at the market.""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6600><STRONG>""Boy wouldn't that be funny to say ""my job is a meat beater.""</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#330033>Funny shit. I almost choked on my minute steak.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#330033>Of course, I returned home with various crap that they always pawn off on me. Tonight I got a salad shaker, a wine cooler, and a coin sorter. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#330033>Grandparents are hilarious, aren't they??</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#330033>I am getting back my picture CD of my new kitty on the 5th. Then I will be posting a trillion pictures of my baby. Bet you can't wait.</FONT></P>"

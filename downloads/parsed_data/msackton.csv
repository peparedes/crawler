"event","We joined a farm this year, which means every Tuesday we get vegetables from our farm delivered to a nearby location. The season has been a bit slow, but today we got a couple of patty pan squash almost 8"" across and two giant eggplants. Plus an enormous bunch of basil. And other stuff too. Yay farm fresh veggies! Next best thing to actually having any sort of outside area where we could grow food ourselves.

Now I just need to figure out what to do with 5 lbs of squash between now and Saturday, when we leave for Boston..."

"event","We went to NYC this past weekend to visit friends and relatives. It was nice - we visited <lj user=""rhianona""> and N., her boyfriend (who is also one of <lj user=""faerichilde"">'s old friends from high school). We also saw another one of <lj user=""faerichilde"">'s friends from high school, and my cousin and his girlfriend. It was nice to catch up with people and to hang out in NYC, a city I really enjoy.

We also had some pretty good food - Friday we went out to Five Points, a new American kind of place. I had skate, which was very good but a bit too fried tasting. Saturday we went out to Josie's, a lower key place with just as good food. I had seared tuna. It was a great trip, and every time I visit NYC I get more into living there. But <lj user=""faerichilde""> isn't entirely sure she agrees, and anyway, the residency programs will be deciding where we live, not so much us :)"

"event","It has been quite a while since I last posted. 9 months maybe? I mostly use this thing to read what other people post, but I figure it is time for an update, and maybe I should even get back in the habit of writing here.

The big news since I last posted is that I married <lj user=""faerichilde"">. We got married in Florida (where her parents live) on Feb 20 of this year. It was a great party, despite being on the most expensive weekend of the year to get from the Northeast to Florida. We went to my parents place in New Hampshire for our honeymoon, and then drove from NH back to Philadelphia. NH was lovely - snowy and beautiful, and a great place to relax and enjoy each others company. Although we had plans to cook a bunch of fancy dinners and forgot to bring the recipes. But our improvisational skills were actually up to the task. On the drive back we spent one night at The Villa in Westerly, RI, and one night at the St. Regis in NYC. The St. Regis is the most luxurious hotel I've ever been in. We had a butler for our floor, who served us tea in our sitting room (they upgraded us to a suite). The Villa was also quite nice, in a upscale B&B sort of way. 

March was nice - we took a weekend trip to D.C. (we hadn't been together) and in general kept pretty busy. June was nice too - we went to Ithaca to visit with a friend from Brandeis and my brother, and <lj user=""faerichilde"">'s parents visited over Memorial Day. April and May were a bit slow though, but that's okay. 

We got back from Nantucket recently, and are heading to Boston for the month of August. <lj user=""faerichilde""> is doing an elective rotation at Children's Hospital. We will be living with my parents in Lexington, but that should be fine. And it will be nice to go into the office every day.

Other than that, not much to report. Work is going well - each year I really do enjoy it more, and feel less like I might want to do something else. Of course, the money helps with that :). We are madly planning our many vacations - a two week trip to Italy this fall, and a two week trip to the Pacific Northwest/Alaska next May.

Anyway, that's my life. Especially for those of you who have recently friended me who I haven't talked to in a while. Let's see how long updating this thing really lasts :)"

"event","The week went by quite fast. That is good, I guess. I wish I had gotten more done at work though. Tonight we are going to a Shabbat dinner with some people we met via my cousin. We've had Shabbat with this group once before and it was a lot of fun, so it should be fun this time too. 

I reorganized my office last night - moved my desk so that I could look out the window from it. I like the new setup a lot. 

The Kerry campaign has been calling me to try to get my to volunteer. And I'd be willing, except they keep calling and asking if I can do something the same night that they call. Which I never feel like. But one of these days I'll get involved in politics for real again. It is a good way to meet people, if nothing else.

Oh, we decided on something to get engraved on our rings: ""i carry your heart with me"" (from the e.e. cummings poem of the same name).

Must go help Dana with the cooking."

"event","Owning a car is annoying. I ended up spending most of the day yesterday dealing with a new license, getting plates for our car, getting a new title for our car, and getting our car registered. The place near us to do all this was closed for repairs, so I had to schlep out about 15 blocks, and then it turned out that <lj user=""faerichilde""> needed to be there as well (because the car is titled in both our names) and therefore she had to schlep out to AAA center as well. Oh yeah, PA is weird and only has a couple state run places where you can get plates. Mostly you have to do it at random places that offer the service (AAA, for example). But it is all dealt with and we can now legally drive our car, which is good because <lj user=""faerichilde""> is driving it up from Florida with her dad next week. 

In other news, the Mad East Coast Tour(tm) starts today. I'm leaving for Florida tonight and won't be back in Philadelphia for three weeks."

"event","Been back in Philly for a couple of days now, which has been nice. It is pleasant to sleep in my own bed, and especially to not be away from <lj user=""faerichilde"">. My VPN router died, which was slightly annoying because it took a while to get some work stuff setup on backup systems, but that's okay.

In other news I got my hair cut yesterday. It is now short. For the first time since I was a junior in high school. It is a slightly strange feeling, but I like it. Although I look a <b>lot</b> more like Tim (my twin brother) than I used to. Even though it isn't the same haircut as his, it is similar, and it is short. Maybe I'll put up a picture or something later, but I'm too lazy to right now.

Also: today <lj user=""faerichilde""> takes the first step of the USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Exam, aka the boards). She's been studying nonstop for a month now. It will be very nice when she is done (and I imagine she'll be even more relieved than I will be)."

"event","I got a new computer and cube at work today. Not very meaningful, because I only spend about 4 weeks a year (if that) in Boston, but it is nice to have a faster computer for when I am up here. Also, I moved out of the John Dyas Memorial Cube (John Dyas is one of my co-workers who moved to Dublin) which has its advantages. Chiefly, the whiteboard in the John Dyas Memorial Cube was covered with the words ""John Dyas Memorial Cube"" and given that they've been written on the whiteboard for two years now, I didn't feel like I could erase them. Plus I liked John and he deserves a memorial cube in the office *grin*.

Also, my new cube is near a window, so it gets better light than my old cube. And having a computer in the office as fast as my computer at home is really nice and reduces some frustrations."

I'd highly recommend it to one and all. It was as good, or perhaps even better than the first one. It was a brilliant farce of Hollywood, complete with a fake E! network.

In other news, my sister graduates high school today, so we are off to her graduation pretty soon, and then to a dinner at my aunt's house. It will be nice to see family and so on."

"event","After Hours (the tux rental place) really really needs to step into the 20th century and computerize their stores. It is hard to believe that they don't store information for tux rentals that have been reserved and paid for on a computer, but rather on slips of paper that can be lost.

Which is what happened to all the rental information for the tuxes for my brother's wedding. Luckily, the guy there was nice and believed me when I said we had already paid.  And there are still six weeks to the wedding, so it isn't like they we aren't going to have the tuxes. 

But still, dealing with it was an hour of my life. *sigh*"

"event","It was a pretty boring Memorial Day. <lj user=""faerichilde""> studied on Saturday and Monday; Sunday we didn't do much (except go out to brunch and do some wedding stuff). Saturday and Monday I re-read the Harry Potter books (in the middle of the fifth one by now). Saturday night was nice - we went out to dinner at Effie's, a great little neighborhood Greek place, and went to see Hello Dolly and the Walnut St. Theater. Unfortunately, I wasn't that into the show. It was well done, but I couldn't get into Dolly or the whole plot.

So, pretty boring weekend, actually, although I enjoyed all the reading. I am still behind at work somewhat. Oh well. And it would have been nice to be busier, but oh well again. I'll be in Boston next week, which will be fun. And then <lj user=""faerichilde""> finishes her boards, and the mad dash up and down the east coast begins. Which should be fun."

"event","My post last night about philosophy didn't really explain what I was talking about, so I'm going to try again, this time with more zombies.

<lj-cut text=""some philosophical ramblings"">

The question at hand is basically this: is it possible that in some other world, I could have a zombie twin (in other words, an exact physical duplicate of me, but without any conscious experience)? If it is possible, then consciousness isn't physical. If it isn't, then consciousness is physical. 

Now, I'm convinced that some other world could exist in which consciousness did not arise from a physical duplicate of me. To put it another way, when God made the world, after setting the physical laws and all the physical stuff, there was more to do to make consciousness. And I'm convinced that in a philosophical sense, that makes consciousness nonphysical. My zombie twin could exist. I could even be my zombie twin. No one would know the difference, because my zombie twin acts exactly as I do, he just doesn't have conscious experience. I know that I'm not my zombie twin, but the rest of you will just have to take my word for it.

But what I don't see is why it matters, if in our world, consciousness does exist, and brain states cause it. To put it another way: if Star Trek teleporters are metaphysically possible in our world, and if consciousness doesn't change when are physical particles are sent through space and reassembled, it doesn't seem very meaningful to say that consciousness isn't physical. But unless I'm missing something, that seems to be what a lot of philosophers argue.

"event","I am reading a book, <i>The Conscious Mind</i>, about the mind-body problem, by Dave Chalmers. Now it is pretty good overall, although fairly technical in some places and therefore hard to follow. I'm having a hard time getting the point of it all though. 

He argues that consciousness is not physical (or as he puts it, that it is not logically supervenient on the physical, which means that it cannot be reductively explained in terms of the physical). Okay, I follow his argument, I'm convinced for the most part. But then he argues that consciousness <b>is</b> naturally supervenient on the physical. Which means that in the real world (as opposed to imaginary worlds) consciousness depends on the physical, or more simply, some particular brain state causes some particular conscious experience. 

So, if he believes that, who cares about the ontological questions? It all seems like much ado about nothing, in a way. Of course, it is fun much ado about nothing. So I guess I'm just being snarky. But <lj user=""doxasticpirate""> will understand this post, even though he probably doesn't agree that it's all pointless :)"

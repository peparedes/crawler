"event","So i went to see Gordo the other day... i really miss him. we went out on a date to the red lobster where we decided to start with dessert... good way to go. they have awesome key lime pie! (i know were rebels right- don't poke fun)  then we went to see garfield... it was the last movie playing that i could go see without getting home too late (drive from fayetteville to raleigh) it was cute though.  Gordo is moving to utah (if im right - he can correct me if not) to live with bobby, his best friend.  He is going to have to come see me otherwise ill throw a tantrum of all sorts.

When i got back to raleigh i stopped by eddie's house sitting gig... saw some of the old guys including the ex nate, brandon, Eddie (of course ) and good ol' trosky... that was interesting... i would only imagine a guy would give up after you talk to your boyfriend on the phone in that little voice that means your going out or what not.... guess he didn't get the hint... So as i left he proceeded to chase me out. im glad he doesn't live here anymore

The night before i got my wisdom teeth out i went to chapel hill though and i got to meet some of martin's friends... unfortunately since i had to take medicine by a certain time for the wisdom teeth they probably think im all sketch and whatnot... but 50 first dates is a good movie.


Well the past week has been full of.... laughing gas, endocet, percocet, amoxicillian, advil... and many other drugs.  On wednesday i got my wisdom teeth removed. what fun!  i have to say the operation wasn't that bad and i highly recommend it... its better than a day at the beach.   Instead of sleeping until 12 everyday i got to wake up at 8, 12, 4, and so forth taking medication that would put me to sleep for the rest of the day... my kind of vacation! Well after getting dry sockets today (excructiating pain) i got to visit my oral surgeon... but more drugs... so more sleep. so i guess its all good.


Well since i look like complete and utter crap i think ill head off to bed and get some beauty rest before school starts back... that should give me enough time to get a start.... As eddie would say... theres just not enough time for you to get what you need... he'd say something like that

"event","my overall summer is boring. but i wouldn't really want it to be hectic and full of things.  I rather enjoy my three nights a week at outback. sleeping until 12 and going to lunch with friends... and of course driving to chapel hill to see martin. i can't think of a better way to spend the summer.  In about two weeks i move back to greensboro permanently... (i think)  Getting my house with mary, sonya, and heather... lots of cleaning yay!  but it will be a month to just chill then start the long task of worrying about nursing school... i can't wait!

Now for matt,  not forgetting you i decided to give you half of this entry!! you should be excited....  i have to say i miss our long walks to the caf.. the drunken piggy back rides in the elevator , playing frisbee in the hall and of course pretending to have sex on Brendans bed...   haha... i just thought of the time we tricked him into thinking that i liked you... i know youre not laughing brendan.. but it was a good joke. you were totally convinced.  So, Matt... if things don't work out with Martin you will be the first to know.   Hope to hear from you soon... i miss you... i mean......
what? Anyways... hopefully ill see you this summer Julyish??   

To all a happy summer!! - just remember its one of your last (on a happy note)"

Anyways... money kinda sucked for a saturday night.. but its way better than the greensboro crowd right?...   youre smiling if you know what im talking about.  so anyways. i got to close! yay!!  its weird to be working again... but if you get the chance come see me and you can give me crap. as long as you tip me in one way or another (jk) -ill take the money

"event","so... it only took me like 7 months but i did it!! you can now know what i look like... and im laughing at you by the way!

Tonight i went to Kanki (japanese steakhouse) with my momma... some good quality mother daughter time... yum yummm! its really good, you outta try it

Martin got his wisdom teeth taken from him today... i feel bad.. i wish i could be there for him.. but i feel his pain... i have to get mine removed soon... i think all the dentists are planning one big vacation... hes the third person i know to get them removed in the past week (Eddie, Nate, Martin)... although eddie doesn't count because hes not human (correction: its not human)  so, if you see a bunch of dentists in hawaii or the bahamas.. youll know why. those bastards gangin up on college students when they come home!

So my hair is no longer red!! yay... back to its original color... i think it looks good, but who cares what i think right.... my biggest hipocrit (sp?) is heather... shes a fashion diva... i think she'd even know if she turned blind... weird senses that girl has....     but i got it cut, and the closest thing to describe it would be the ""rachel Hair"" ... if you understand that... its not what i asked for. but it works for me.

So, outback this weekend and tuesday... ya know you want to drop by!!   7500 creedmoor rd!!! you can come make fun of me if ya feel like it.

Once i got back to the dorm i called Dominos pizza and the guy on the phone was an obnoxious jerk!!  Anyways im going out with heather, ross, sonya and beaver... because two certain guys didn't want to go (**cough paul+**cough**aubrey**) Anyways ross has two dates tonight.. so he might just be the luckiest guy out there.  Yesterday was super fun.. I found out i have pink eye (super!!)  so it looks like im really high all the time.. i can't say its not fun.  Whenever i put my eyedrops in it looks like im crying... thats fun to play off.  Then sonya decided she was going to stamp me with an inkpad because i was ""an invalid""  .. but i got her back.. i stamped her whole face and chased her down the hall with the inkstamp thingy... it was funny......................i guess you had to be there.

Today i experimented with sonya just to see how far she would believe me.  I got far enough to tell her that she had to download a specific font on to her computer otherwise it would be unacceptable to the teacher. Also that 3-4 pages means both sides.  She was spazing out. it was hilarious but anyway.  I think im going to miss my future frat boys.  Their being sucked into the keg vortex as we speak.. i mean i don't blame them.. i know nothing about frats except that they have a weekly party.  My twin and backup valentines date are drifting farther and farther away.  I guess thats how life goes, moving on from one place to another, not dwelling in the past.  I need to get over that.

"event","so, its almost 5 in the morning.  i have two tests tomorrow ugh... but its okay because brandy is the best ever and we studied forever.  I think we proabably talked for at least an hour without studying.  Tonight is my second night without sleep. im surprised i haven't died yet, But its finally friday and im going to bed at 4 promptly.. i think with only 15 minutes of sleep in the past two days.  The good news is that next week i have absolutely nothing because of the extra few hours i have had lately.  So hopefully i can do good on both of my tests and make for a better weekend.  I will be in raleigh on saturday if youre there... i don't really know too many of ya anymore.  So, this really cool thing happened to me the other day... Jason Biggs was walking through the dorm and Brendan being the nice guy that he is and know what a big fan i am.. got me his autograph... how cool is that!!  if any of yall wanna see it just let me know, i don't want to keep this one to myself.  Hahaha.. heather just woke up... she looks like shes on crack (she has to study for hdf).  Charlotte is getting annoying so i must go... only two more!!!!

P.S. BRANDY IS THE COOLEST (we bonded)              -al"

"event","Yeah so this is about the fourth week into the semester and there has definitely been a lot of work.  Im procrastinating at the moment so i figured i would make a journal to help me later on when i don't want to do my work.  So, here goes...  Over the past week i have had 5 tests and a paper. Needless to say, i didn't get any sleep last night ive been up for almost 36 straight hours.  Im looking at apartments and houses so sonya mary heather and i can party it up... i mean.. study all the time.  Im going back to raleigh on saturday (for the day) wow, exciting... valentines day is coming up... woo big decisions i don't know if i can handle it...

p.s. eddie im your god for being such a loser and watching old shows"

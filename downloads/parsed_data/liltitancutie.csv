 Sunday August 15, 2004 we left my house bout 9:10am and we went to blockbusters and the gas station to get the stuff we needed and then we were off on the road... by 10:05 we were in Rockwwod, Mi. then bout 12:30 we were in cleavlan Arkon, Ohio we were like 18-19 miles away from cedar point i wish we could have stoped.. :'( ... But today we are mostly driving... BORING!!!! well at 3:05 we were in West Virgina and I was sleeping most of this time... then at bout 5""53 we were in Virgina and we stoped and got gas and some food... at 7:03 we were in North Carrolina.. then we stoped and got a hotel it was the holidae inn and we ate there and chilled then we were relaxing in the hotel.. then in the morning we got ready and packed up and then we left and we were off.. we were 4 1/2 hours away from were we wanted to be.. then afta all that driving we were finally there and we took bout a 1/2 hour looking at hotels and then we finally found one it was called the yatchsman and it was really nice we were the 10th floor and we had ocean view so it was beatiful and i could open are door and see the Alantic ocean.. it was soo nice......

    On Monday August 16, 2004, after all that we unpacked and we went shopping on the strip and we went to the ripleys belive it or not mesume but that was kinda lame... we went shopping some more and then we got some food and i got a henna tatoo.. its sweet!!! then we seen my cousin and my uncle and they had been there for bout 2 weeks.. me and my cousin went to this nite club called attic from 10:30 till 2:00 am, we had fun we were getting on this stage thing and dancin and we got beeads from dancng too.. i got 12 it was really hot there too.. .lol not alot of hot guys we could have stayed out longer but my cousin had to get back cause she was leaving in the morning to go back home.... lol so that sucked...
        On tuesdat August 17, 2004, we went shopping again at broadway on the beach and we went to ripleys belive it or not aquarim and i got  to pet a stingray and a shark it was really scary. o and i starfish. then we went to peir 14 resturant behing our hotel. we went to hard rock cafe too and we went to the tanger outlets mall and shopped for skool clothes.. eww skool.. lmfao...

     On Wensday August 18 ,2004, we went to the beach and layed out, went to the pool. we went and walked the strip again and playe video games and got food. (we ate at peaches). we went to the nascar speedpark and the nascar cafe it was fun.. then we went to piggly wigglys and krispy kream and chilled...


 On Thursday August 19, 2004 we went to the beach and pool again and layed out.. then we got dressed and went to some harley dealership i got to drive  in this big parking lot it was fun i peeled out. lol we went to eat at some nasty smelly seafood place it was gross just cause the smell.. and then we went back to our hotel and then we chilled , then went to play minature golf then came back home and beach then showered.. I took a bath and chilled. packed up cuase we were leaving the next day and driving straiight through... boring again!!!!!

The Chinese didn't invent the infernal things for entertainment, after all.  They were fighting wars.  Scaring off evil spirits.  And playing mean-spirited practical jokes on the tightly-wound, most likely.

Well, at least there was something <i>else</i> for me to be doing while everyone was gawping at the sky <strike><3<3<3</strike>

Isshin, I believe I owe you dinner for losing the bet?  <strike>And I'm going to give you fair warning, do NOT come in the archery hut without knocking any more...</strike>"

"event","You hear that?  So don't go waking me up when I'm sleeping off the migraine that is just WAITING TO POUNCE after having to drag my son out of a foxhole and put his brain back in working order.

Kurosaki-kun, thank you for being prompt with the medication.  And while you're at it you might want to thank your bloody stars that your family is only moderately fucked-up, and mostly still alive.

"event","<center>Just in case you should meet a large, gray, EXTREMELY friendly cat wandering around campus seeking petties and an email account of his own, such as this one:

I would like you to know that that happens to be Catullus, who happens to be mine.  Which you might possibly guess from the tag on his collar that says, ""If found, please give much petting, and then return to Ishida Ryuuken.""  Although if it's more convenient, I suppose you can always return him to Uryuu.

Just to refresh your memory,

THIS IS CATULLUS.

"event","The word is usually translated as just ""duty"" or ""piety"", but the concept is far deeper and more complex than that, particularly in Virgil.  It's a very <i>Roman</i> value, all about showing proper reverance to your station in life and to your dependents...but most particularly to your ancestors.  These are the Romans, after all--your family ties are absolutely EVERYTHING.

It's Aeneas' virtue, his saving grace even as he abandons his wife to die in the ruins of a burning city, abandons the land and king he swore to defend to his last drop of blood: Aeneas still has his <i>pietas</i>, because he walks out of the city leading his little boy by the hand--but MUCH more importantly because he walks out carrying his father on his back, risking so much to protect what is venerable.

The son is supposed to take the risk to protect the father, rather than the other way 'round.

I find that scene more disturbing than any other in Virgil.

<strike>But Uryuu is greatly mistaken if he thinks I'm going to go easy on him in class or on the target range, <i>pietas</i> or no.</strike>"

"event","the feast of st. wenceslas was a complete non-starter due to an unforseen event that also proved to us that americans are no longer anywhere near holding the title of ugliest tourists.
the night of the 28th also happened to be the night of a big football game between scotland and the czech republic.  we had seen plenty of people going about during the day wearing kilts and red shirts but didn't think much of it.  at eight o'clock, kristin and i decided to go out to old town square to see what was going on, if anything.  what we found was complete bedlam.  drunken scots rambled all over the place, shouting, shirtless, and red-faced.  the square, which is quite large, was completely full of trash.  there was broken glass everywhere, and even now, two days later, there's a ton of it.  i tried to take pictures to document this travesty, but i don't think they came out very well.
the biggest shame is that old town square is such a nice place in prague, containing some of its most beautiful buildings, including a huge old astrological clock and several cathedrals and museums.  we walked around in shock but the face of one woman who rounded the corner into the square still sticks with me.  she looked like she was about to cry.  the czech police stood around by the van load and maintained a presence, but didn't do anything.  i've talked to a couple of prague citizens since then and apparently this sort of activity amongst visiting scots is pretty standard.  terrible.
i don't know if i've mentioned it, but kristin has been sick the last few days, so we've been taking it fairly easy, which is fine as a slow pace seems most appropriate for this city and, after all, we're on vacation.
we have still managed to take in many sites, including the nearby jewish cemetary and memorial.  the memorial is a synagogue with all the names of czechoslavak victims of the nazis inscribed in the walls.  it was almost unbearable.  there were over 80,000 and filled the entire building.  by the time i got out i was in tears.  it was terrible but it had to be seen.
the jewish cemetery was also incredible.  apparently jews were historically given only a limited space to bury their dead and so the bodies are buried, in some cases, twelve deep and the headstones are placed appropriately.  it's surreal and i took a lot of pictures.
after the incident with the scots, i can almost understand, but it seems as though, in some cases, we are charged a tourist tax.  a lot of the tourist sites will charge you for anything they can:  to use the WC, to take pictures, etc.  as a result, despite the fact that it's so cheap here, money flows out like water when touristing around.  it's pretty bad, but, like i said, after the incident of the scots, i can almost understand.
today we aren't going to do much; probably just look at stores and eat lunch, perhaps go up to the bar later.  we'll see.  on monday we're planning on going to a nearby town called jablonec, which is supposed to be quite nice, like prague minus the tourists."

"event","i'm currently using one of the computers at bohemia bagel, a bagel shop right down the street from the hostel.  the hostel has free internet usage, which is great, but only two computers to go around, so that usually means waiting at least a half hour if you want to save yourself some crown.  and, seeing as time equals money...
the biggest problem with using one these computers is that it's rather a crap shoot whether you're going to get a good computer or not.  i happen to have a bad one right now.  the monitor is so badly out of focus it makes me feel like i'm losing my vision.
anyway, prague has yet to lose any of its allure for me.  there are so many beautiful buildings in this city and the surrounding area, there's always something to look at.  even the average buildings almost all have some sort of intricate design or crest etched into them somewhere.  that makes it truly worth the sprained neck to be constantly looking up and around in this city.
there's music everywhere in this city, another thing i really rather like.  our first night here, we went to the charles bridge and saw a jazz group on the bridge playing some hot club of france-type material.  a few days later there was a dixieland jazz group there.  and there's a gypsy guy a few blocks away from our hostel who is ALWAYS there, playing some instrument that i have never before seen in my life and howling along with it.
yesterday in wenceslas square there was an orchestra and a choir playing some barouque-type stuff that was quite pretty.  we guessed that it's because of the feast of st. wenceslas (known around here as vlakov) that is going on today.  there's been fireworks the last few nights and the holiday is apparently a lot like st. patrick's day, at least as the czechs know it.  there's probably a lot more to it than that, but we're going to have to wait to find out."

"event","i forgot to mention the most amazing thing that we saw while in germany.  out on the far east outskirts of eastern berlin is a park built by the soviets called Treptower park.  there is a HUGE soviet war memorial that we made the pilgramage to.  when i say huge, i means huge.  it's like something out of ancient rome.  there is apparently something like 5000 dead russian soldiers buried there and there's huge statues and about twenty stone tablets the size of coffins that have engravings in them that tell the story of the german invasion of the soviet union.  it was incredible.  needless to say, i took many, many pictures.
our second day here in the czech republic we made the one hour train journey out to Kutna Hora, ESE of prague.  the reason we went out there was to see the bone ossuary, a 14th century chapel that contains the bones of 40,000 victims of the black plague, arranged into stacks and piles and chandeliers and just generally all over the place.  again, an incredible sight.  again, i took many pictures.
aside from that, we've just rather been bumming around the city, enjoying the slow pace and soaking up czech culture.  a couple days ago we went up to prague castle and its surrounding buildings, including a huge gothic cathedral.  the view from the area is incredible as it located up in the hills surrounding the city.  one has the option to walk up the hill or take a tram.  we took the tram and saved ourselves the heart attack.
today we toured the communism museum.  it was quite incredible.  i really had no idea about the communist history of czechoslovakia.  they only got out from under the thumb of communist oppression in 1989, just like the germans, so many people here probably clearly remember what it was like.  it sounded quite horrible and we saw plenty of video footage of tanks driving around Wenceslas Square (now a huge shopping area) to prove it.  all those feelings i had about things happening here were not ill-founded.
we haven't had much of the native food here as it's a little hard to find.  mostly we've been eating italian as there is a great place nearby that is quite cheap.  i have, however, had czech goulash, which was quite similar to potroast with gravy.  still good, but nothing extraordinary.
tonight we're probably going to the hostel bar to enjoy insanely cheap drinks and tomorrow...who knows."

"event","this is, i believe, our fourth day in the czech republic.  melissa left us the other day to ""do her own thing"" which means going to munich for octoberfest.  before she did that, however, she got insanely shattered on absinthe at the hostel bar here and made quite a large scene/spectacle of herself.  so perhaps it is for the best.  she does seem to want to be doing something else most of the time we're doing something.  but at this point, this is all old hat and i don't feel like belabouring it anymore.
the train trip out of germany was quite nice as it took us through all kinds of forested areas and little tiny german towns that clung to river banks and hillsides by their teeth and eyelashes.  all very pretty.  
upon reaching the czech border our train was stopped and boarded by border patrol from both nations.  the czech official seemed to take his job much more seriously than the german one.  he also, probably as a result of his seriousness, seemed much scarier.  
the atmosphere completely changed upon crossing into the czech republic.  everything on the way to prague had a look of decay:  every brick was stained, every paint job was peeling around the edges, everything just looked a little worn and tired.  the weather, appropriately, changed for our entry to a nice seattle grey.  i like it here.  i mentioned a couple days back that, unlike berlin, which tries very hard to cover up its past, one can feel with certainty that things actually happened here.
the streets and building here are beautiful.  i know i've said this about every city we've been to, but it is true for every one of them.  i really like the streets here because they're very narrow and twisty - you're lucky if you can see more than a few blocks down most of them.  it lends a feeling of being enveloped, swallowed up by the city.
unfortunately, many of the areas of prague are completely overrun by tourists and tour groups which make me embarassed to be here.  it's terrible.  in some places you can barely even move.  but it's only in certain areas.  the area of our hostle is relatively tourist free.
now that i feel like i'm getting on a roll, i must unfortunately stop as kristin and i have a date for coffee with a very nice mexican that we've met here.  he's only 19 and he came here by himself to get a job and live abroad.  his first day of work is today and, as expected, he's quite nervous.  we have every confidence that he'll be fine as he is one of the most genuinely nice people we've ever met.
so, until, next time a computer is free...

"event","we're leaving amersterdam in a couple of hours.  i really liked this city.  it wasn't nearly as shocking or sinful as its reputation would lead one to think.  yes, there are drugs and yes, there are prostitues, but the vast majority of the city is just city.  cafes, restaurants, retail stores.  the canals are incredible.  they're quite filthy as far as the water goes, but they look very nice and the constant water makes me feel at home.
everybody here rides a bike and everybody speaks english.  i think one experience that stands out the most as far as illustrating the so-called language barrier is at one of the first cafes we went to.  we studied the menu for a long time, trying to decipher it and asking the waitress what were probably a lot of annoying questions as the menu was completely in dutch.  after about the tenth question she pulled an english menu out of nowhere and held it out to us.  everybody got a laugh out of that.
on the topic of cafes and bars, service here is not as it is in the US.  everything has a more relaxed atmosphere.  they have a term for it here in the netherlands that i've forgotten, but they're more about the experience than the actual filling of the belly with food or drink.  this means that there are no quick restaurant visits.  most of the time we went out, it took about twenty minutes just for a server to show up.  i didn't mind and i actually kind of like the idea.  if you're in a hurry, get fast food or go to a pastry window, of which there are many.  unfortunately, it's almost impossible to get a glass of water here.  i don't know why, but it's weird.
the only legal drugs here are the natural ones:  marijuana and mushrooms.  however, about every ten feet some guy will mumble out the corner of his mouth, ""coca.""  so everything else is available it one is so inclined.  unfortunately, it seems a lot of our fellow traveles, especially those from the US and the UK ARE so inclined, bumbling their way through amsterdam from one high to another.
oh, yes, absinthe is also legal here and i had to try it so as to get the whole hemingway/lost generation experience.  it tastes pretty much as i expected - kinda gross.  a very strong licorice flavor with an alcoholic punch.  very interesting.
alas, if this is a hemingway novel, then i think i'm robert coen.
we saw a few museums here, including the anne frank house, which, as expected, really took it out of us.  but it needed to be seen.  aside from that, we took a canal tour, spent a lot of time walking, drinking coffee, and shopping about.  the canal tour was pretty neat as it went through a lot of the canals and even out into the port.  it was interesting to see the differences in the various districts as far as housing styles.  all the houses are still tall and narrow, but there's a lot of stylistic differences.
being inside these houses is pretty incredible.  every house has a winch on the outside for getting goods and furniture in and out because the stairs are worthless for anything but humans and even then it's pretty iffy.  going up a stairway almost guarantees injury.  they're called ""leg breakers"" and i now know why.
our hostel here was pretty fantastic.  it's called the bulldog and it's a neat old building with a bar/lounge in the bottom, a terrace on top, and hip decoration throughout.  i'm almost sad to go because i think i could live here no problem.  it's quite beautiful and the dutch are very nice and very relaxed.
okay, time is almost up.  off to berlin."

"event","last night we took in the night life in piccadilly and it was a goddamned mobscene.  the only thing i can compare it to is if one were to take the saturday night crowd from pioneer square and spread them out through the entirety of seattle.  people people everywhere and all drunk and obnoxious to a man.  we decided it was not our scene quite early and found one reasonable pub that 
a) wasn't standing room only
b) wasn't playing terrible music
c) didn't have a doorman/velvet rope
d) wasn't full to the brim with tourists
warm beer doesn't bother me a bit.
from our one pub we tried to find another drinking establishment that met the above criteria but met with utter failure.  we did, however, find a great little french/italian restaurant called chez victor that had perhaps the best atmosphere and most agreeable waitstaff i've ever encountered.  our waiter was from albania and within about ten minutes i decided he can be the godfather of my unborn children.  some people just have a certain something about them.
we spent some time before heading out last night talking to one of our brazilian room-mates.  she told us all about brazil and it was all quite sad because the place sounds beautiful, but apparently crime and corruption are completely out of control.
today kristin and i went to waterloo.  melissa attempted to make the trip, but after a short while she decided she couldn't handle the walking and went back to the hostel.  so the two of us went off to the imperial war museum which bored kristin terribly but, of course, was a veritable heaven for me.  
okay, i'm running out of internet time here, so i'm going to have to wrap up.  tomorrow we head off the brussels, belgium bright and early.  it's only for a short layover, but it should still be fun.
additionally, i bought a new digital camera at the last minute along with a big old memory card which will allow me at least 800 photos, so there's going to be a lot for me to show when i get back.  i almost long for the days of slide projectors."

"event","i'm currently at a burger king only a few feet down the street from the hostel.  it's good luck that the local BK doubles as an internet cafe as the common room at the hostel, which also contains all the hostel's computers, is closed until monday - the day we leave.
travel day was fairly hellish.  it contained three airports and one very long flight.  the only thing that kept me sane on the flight was the good company and the constant entertainment and free drinks provided by air canada.
england looks a lot like washington and, aside from the rapid drop in temperature at night, the weather is almost identical.
we're staying in the piccadilly circus area of london which, i am unhappy to report, is extremely commecial.  it seems that every major retailer is located in piccadilly in multiples.  after walking around for several hours yesterday, i felt like i was in one of those old hanna-barbara cartoons where the characters run and run and the background behind them just cycles.  however, even a lowly mcdonalds or starbucks is in a building built during george washington's first term.  prices here are almost identical to prices in america, except in pounds.  and, given the exchange rate, that means that everything costs about double.  so when i go to starbucks, of which there are many, my americano costs the equivalent of four dollars instead of two.
there's a lot of great parks here, however.  we've gone to a couple of them so far and they're all quite expansive.
additionally, we've already seen pretty much all the sights that tourists are supposed to see:  buckingham palace, wellington gate, big ben, westminster abbey, hyde park.  we even tried to go to the american embassy but it has apparently been on lock-down since september 11th, 2001 to anything except official business so we couldn't get in.
we've spent most of today outside the picadilly area, which has been a breath of fresh air.  all the other parts of london make piccadilly circus seem like a las vegas version of london.  everybody runs around at a hundred miles an hour in every which way.  traffic signals for pedestrians and cars seem to have little or no meaning.  i almost snapped late yesterday when, with an empty stomach and almost no sleep, i encountered one inconsiderate person too many.  almost snapped.  i ended up laughing instead of killing.  a better result, i think.  otherwise i may has had some official business for our embassy.
we went to the victoria and albert museum today and took in their display of islamic art, which was quite interesting.  we then went to the natural history museum, which turned out to be rather too kid-oriented.  tonight we're going to take in the pubs, which is a good thing because we're all rather footsore, especially melissa, who pulled a muscle a week ago and has only been exacerbating her injury since.  she has been gimping along with us with great difficulty and pain.
tomorrow we're going to get our actual tickets for our chunnel trip to belgium on monday and check out the waterloo area, including the imperial war museum.  should be good.
overall, our collective impression of london is rather luke warm, mostly because of the piccadilly silliness.  i know both kristin and i are rather anxious to move along.  i hope at a future date i may explore england, or even simply london, more fully.  don't get me wrong, though; the architecture here is incredible and certain parts have and deep feeling of history, but our home base area just feels to artificial, not very foreign, and definitely not very english."

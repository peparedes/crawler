"event","If it's illegal to melt down the US currency (pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, etc) do you really 100% own your money?  http://tinyurl.com/4hm8oot
I would think that melting down your coinage would make very good sense and would make a good trade.  As of Friday's close, pre 1982 copper pennies are worth 2.8 cents each and nickels are worth 18 cents each.  Buying a couple hundred rolls of nickels, melting them down, and basically tripling your money after expenses makes perfectly food sense to me.  It's a helluva trade.  If we're not allowed to melt down our coins, why is the treasury allowed to take the copper pennies out of circulation, melt them down and sell the copper in the cash market?"

"event","It might be of benefit to all of you to watch out for the specter of hyperinflation.  I;m looking at these commodity prices all day long and going, ""Holy Fuck."" Sugar is up 113% since may??????? Corn, wheat, gold, silver, it's all going up. Gasonline will be $5 real soon.  Our fed is doing much of the same thing the central bank did in the old Weimar Republic after WW1.  Hyperinflation benefits anyone in debt and some speculators. Farmers in heavy debt do particularly well.  It destroys savers, pensioners, bond holders, rentiers, etc.  In fact in the old Weimar the rich savers had their bond holdings wiped out and were forced to sell their funature and possessions in the street.  However, there will be opportunities of a lifetime for the sagacious speculator.  ANybody holding dollars is screwed big time.  At the end of the inflation in post WW1 Germany the number of Marks that would buy 1 egg would have bought 500,000,000,000,000 eggs at the beginning of the inflation.  Something to think about."

"event","The other day, I was forced to attend an amateur showing of Dickens ""A Christmas Carol.""  The production was  well executed, the stagecraft was excellent, and the scenery  was first rate.  I've seen the Dickens classic so many times, I either just nod off, daydream, or try to improve my mind.  

During the show, I started to think of how the author, Charles Dickens, really hated capitalists and was a socialist at heart.  He portrayed Ebeneezer Scrooge as the protypical capitalist of the day, but his real ""sin"" was that he was a miser, only interested in his self,mistreating everyone. The fact that Scrooge  had a bad attitude and dour personality did not work in his favor and was a great device used by Dickens to generate hatred for capitalists and the rich in general...  

This got me thinking on many levels.  For one thing, Scrooge was a businessman who earned his money fair and square. He cheated nobody and expected his contracts and debts to be paid as per any previous agreements, Scrooge ran a tight ship, to the point of being called miserly. He was a demanding employeer of his clerk Mr. Cratchit, who accepted the employment contract with Mr. Scrooge with good cheer.  Much has been said and written about the evil Mr Scrooge, his name has become part of the lexicon of the definition of an evil capitalist. Even the people in the neighborhood made disparaging remarks about Scrooge, and this mistreatment and lackof respect added to his dour personality. 

There was no evil to Mr Scrooge, and his unfavorable treatment was a literary device, a populist reaction by the left, the socialists who portray all rich as greedy, evil people who allow people to suffer while they live rich, extravagant lives..  As I said before, Mr Scrooge had an employment contract with his clerk, Mr. Cratchit who was a man of good cheer.  Cratchit's wife constantly complained that Scrooge was an old miser with a flinty heart of stone.  She neglected to mention that Mr. Cratchit was free to seek employment elsewhere if his working conditions were so bad, but this aspect and so many others were left out by Dickens.. 

 As for Scrooge's miserly description, some would call his miserliness thrift, which is an esteemed Franklinian virtue..  In fact, being a miser is not one of the seven deadly sins, while gluttony is, so Scrooge was unfairly judged..  Part of the play cast Scrooge in a bad light for refusing to give to charity and telling beggars to ""Bugger off."".  It seems to me that a man can do whatever he wants to with his money and charity is not the virtue the popular culture demands.  A rich man is entitled to spend his money any he pleases, just as a poor person is.. Scrooge was not required to spend his money on charity to meet the approval of his inferiors..  In fact, Mr Scrooge's self interest, his sense of business, tidyness,, and attention to detail is the real virtuous behavior in Dickens tale.. 

 Much ado was made about Scrooge's disdain for Christmas, and he was cast in an extremely sour, almost evil mode.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no law that requires one to be full of cheer, false or not, during the Christian holiday seasons,  In fact, a majority of the population of the world does not celebrate these holidays, holidays that are descended from pagan rituals anyways..

 Scrooge's refusal to  participate in a festive dinner with his nephew and wife was his business and he certainly didn't deserve the ridicule heaped upon him by the women folk, nor was he required to offer an explaination or apology..  He was merely excercising his freedom to do what he wanted, and if he chose not to celebrate Christmas, that was his natural, god given right.  During Scrooge's pre ghost phase, he was a hard nosed flinty business man, albeit a bit ill mannered.  There is no law against being ill mannered, dour, maean, or miserly. .  Scrooge was free to do whatever he wanted, with no worries what society would think as long as he behaved within the law and remaining scandal free. 

 

Every good story likes to make a case of human redemption, a change from self interest to the interest and service of the collective. In popular culture, rich are inherently evil, their gains ill gotten off the backs of workers, and the poor always triumph over the rich.   Dickens masterfully pulled this off when he had three ghosts visit Scrooge on Christmas Eve to scare the hell out of him and change his evil ways.  His powerful scare tactics caused Mr Scrooge to abandon his own self interest, abandon his personal freedom for the good of society, destroy the profitability of his business, and spend his hard earned wealth on charity to repent for his earlier miserliness.  

 

The messages Dickens made in a Christmas Carol were very clear.  Productive people must give to the more deserving poor to be considered worthy, rich people are not happy due to guilt, producers must abandon self interest in order to satisfy the needs of others in a society who don't work as hard, businessmen must run their personal business for the sole benefit of their employees, conversely to the detriment of the stockholders. And finally one must give exorbant sums to the poor, provide medical care for the employees, and give retroactive raises to allegedly underpaid employees.  Benevolence is not a virtue in this world, it is a requirement,.  Scrooge was manipulated into this transformation by the three ghosts creating immense guilt and fear, and by the end of the story Mr Scrooge was more concerned with what people thought of him, his personal image, than the real work of creating profits, creating jobs, growing a business, and contributing to the general business climate.

 

At the end of the story Mr. Scrooge was a transformed man.  He was happy, benevolent, highly thought of, giving,almost giddy, much like a person who has had a drink or ten. A good case could be made that he was a better man, but  what he lost was the real tragedy.  Scrooge lost his indendence, his freedom, became dependent not on profits, but on the opinions of others. He was required to give money away, raised expectations of others, and caused economic imbalance by changing the market pay scale of employees in his business.  In a way, Scrooge's new found largesse probably was bad for the economy as a whole.a la theories of Hazlitt.  On another note, happiness tends to be fleeting much like health and I suspect that with Mr Scrooge, old habits die hard..  

 

When the curtain closed, everyone was cheering.  I felt a bit of sadness, as here's another story of poverty trumps wealth, rich is evil while poor is good, and  being a second hander is more important than being a real, virtuous free man, In the end, Mr. Scrooge was the real loser and the real story was the transformationn of a rich, productive man.into a welfare state."

"event","I wonder what part, if any, serendipity plays in my life.  Somehow, I always seem to land on my feet and make continuous improvements in any situation. The past couple of years have been a stormy experience, and I've had to face some mighty stiff headwinds.  Somehow, I've found some resolve and managed quite well.  I endured Denise's death, a disastrous rebound relationship, my son driving me nuts, and other family stuff.  Through all of this, I've been pretty steadfast in maintaining and improving my general condition.  No brag, but I think that many men my age faced with the loss of their partner would have just said ""Fuck It"" and ended their life.  Somehow, I've muddled through all of this.  I think the change of venue, spending a lot of time in NYC has helped me a lot.  New York is like a shot of adrenaline for me and it gives me life and renewal.  Enough blabbering, time to hit the 1st at Aqueduct."

"event","Here's part II

I wholly disagree with your assessment of the ""Southern Belle's"" place in society.  The Southern Belle is woven into all strata of Southern society, including that of the blacks.  The blacks still have debutantes in the South. It is my opinion that Southern women, even at the lowest levels of society, still have a culture(a je ne sais crois), lacking in women elsewhere. I married a Southern woman, after dating women from both the North and South, and find my assessment of them to be accurate.  We've both lived both North and South, and maybe we've seen different things and had different experiences. The term ""Southern Hospitality"" is more than a term, it's a real phenomena that isn't found in the North on the same scale.  The West has the same form of hospitality, but much of the West derives it's culture from the net migration from the South during the reconstruction period.  

As far as bigotry goes, here's a good quote, and not from a Southerner:

""I wii say that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way thye social equality of the white and black races-That I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people: And I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forbid the two races from living together on terms of social and political equality.  And inasmuch that they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race""  

That quote was by Abraham Lincoln in 1858, and was spoken by a true bigot.  

If the South is so backward, why does everyone want to live, retire, or visit here???

The people on the Gulf Coast might take exception to your comment of the real Southerner being a non-Catholic, especially in Louisiana, East-Texas, and Gulfport-Mobile Al.

He's also Hispanic, and has been repeatedly passed over for promotion because he's not part of the good old boy's establishment. He also happens to be a liberal Democrat, but strong on law and order.  I have signed up to be his key strategist and advisor for his campaign.  I was up front with him that I'm a conservative Republican, and he is OK with that.  I also told him about the 4 campaigns I worked on, 3 of them unsuccessful.  He got in touch with the guys I campaigned for, liked what he heard, and signed me up.  

I've already heard from my Republican friends after the word got out, and they're not happy with me.  My e-mail box was bursting at the seams this morning, and I responded with a bulk announcement.  Manatee County is much more Democrat than the county I live in, which is Sarasota County.

My next duty is to help raise money for his campaign, and plan strategy. 

I never, ever, in a million years thought I would be trying to elect a liberal Democrat to an office.

This is the path of hurricane Wilma.  
I showed the easy version(NOAA) as I can't find the map with all 12 hurricane models superimposed upon one another.  Those models all agree within 100 miles of landfall or so.  We will end up with a mandatory evacuation probably starting tomorrow night.  They only had school for 1/2 day today and are closing it tomorrow and Friday to enable folks to get prepared.  At least folks are smart and have begun boarding up stuff.  The grocery stores already are having the usual runs on stuff, and my lovely wife told me that she has to stay until close which is 12AM.  Her hours have been extended so that she will have to be back tomorrow at 6AM.  

I'm glad people aren't waiting until the last minute to get ready for this one.

"event","Dear Cecil:

I have three baseball questions, one technical, one historical, and one theoretical. (1) The record books credit about a dozen players with unassisted triple plays. How, exactly, is this done? (2) Has any team ever made nine double plays or more in a game? (3) Which is more elegant, a perfect game accomplished in 27 pitches, each batter hitting into an out, or one accomplished in 81 strikes, giving the position players nothing to do at all? (Warning: Roger Angell himself refused to answer this question.) --Peter D., Chicago

Cecil replies:

Roger is a good fellow, Pete, but when it comes to fine moral judgments, you'd best stick with Unca Cecil. Let's take your questions in order:

(1) In your ""typical"" unassisted triple play (there have been only eight or so in major league history), you've got men on first and second. The batter hits a hard shot to either (a) the shortstop or second baseman, who catches it to put out the batter, touches second, retiring the lead runner, and then tags out the runner arriving from first, or (b) the first baseman, who tags out the first base runner and then runs to second before the lead runner can return.

One of the classic unassisted triple plays (and the only one ever to occur during a World Series) happened in 1920, in the fifth game between the Cleveland Indians and the Brooklyn Robins (Brooklyn used this wimpy nickname during the time the team was coached by Wilbert Robinson). Cleveland was leading when Pete Kilduff and Otto Miller reached base safely to open the fifth for Brooklyn. Clarence Mitchell then drove to right. The immortal Bill Wambsganss, the Cleveland second baseman, made a leaping catch, stepped on second before Kilduff could get back, then tagged the startled Miller. Other notable events during the 1920 Series included the first grand-slam homer and the first homer by a pitcher in Series history. (Cleveland won the game and the Series.)

Then we have assisted triple plays such as the one on September 7, 1935, when Boston Red Sock Joe Cronin hit a line drive toward third. It bounced off the head of third baseman Odell Hale and into the hands of shortstop Bill Knickerbocker, who started a TP. I know this is a little off the track, but it just came up on my 365-Days-In-Sports desk calendar, and I couldn't stand not to use it.

(2) Not in the majors. The record is seven double plays in a game, which two teams have managed to do: Yankees, August 14, 1942, and Astros, May 4, 1969.

(3) The number of pitches thrown during a perfect game is no more relevant than the number of brush strokes used to paint the Mona Lisa. A perfect game is just that: perfect. To cavil about the minor details of such a performance is to proclaim that one has the morals of a newspaper publisher. I need say no more"

Knowing there would be waves, I strapped one of my longboards on the roof of my car, put the wetsuit in the wetsuit bag and drove over to the south jetty.  I stopped at 7-11 and filled up my biggest cup of coffee with a ton of sugar and cream.  Driving over to the jetty, I noticed the stares of other drivers headed like ants to their work destinations.  A couple of kids looked at the board on my roof and threw me a shaka sign.  Getting over to the jetty, parking and checking out the scene, I noticed steam coming off the water, it was that cold.  The temp on the bank said 42 degrees.  I went to the john in the concession stand and quickly changed into my wetsuit, hood and booties.  A couple of locals were just going out and also a couple of guys I didn't know.  I was OK with the locals but decided to give the other guys a wide berth. The waves were pretty nice, with sets in the chest high range.  They were pretty hollow, with every other wave making a tube that held up without closing out.  The waves were ridable for about 100 yards.  My local buddies and I sat in position and shared waves, lots of waves.  The other guys we didn't know were at the next peak(we call it the hole), and pretty much stayed away from us.  I got in at least 15 good waves in an hour and a half.  I got tubed 3 times and only got closed out once.  The tide started moving, and our break started to get mushy.  Meanwhile, at the hole where the other guys were, the waves started to get really tasty.  They were breaking on both sides with perfect chest high A-frames.  We paddled over there, much to the chagrin of the non-locals who were surfing there.  They started giving us the stink-eye....I was laughing and making loud comments to my buddies about guys we've never seen before giving us the stink-eye at our break.  Nobody was messing with me and I proceeded to shred both the rights and lefts.  One of the non-locals snaked my buddy and actually called him off of the wave while he was snaking him.  My buddy held his temper and just said, don't ever do that again muthafucker.  About 2 set waves later, the same guy snaked my buddy in the same manner.  My buddy dropped off of the wave and paddled back to where we were in rotation.  I told  the other non-locals that we didn't put up with that kind of shit at our break and that they should tell their buddy to show some respect at our beach.  They ignored me.....big mistake.  I had the outside position and caught a head high wave.  I'm running down the line and one of those guys started to drop in on me.  I called him off, but he dropped in anyway.  I did a little fade, and kicked my board right into the area right behind his knee, on his right leg. We both went down and tangled in a mess of leashes and foam.  He was really wincing in pain, and I knew that he wasn't going to come after me.  The other guy that was snaking my buddy came to his aid and started cussing at me.  We told them to fuck off.  They did.  

I was getting tired by this time, so I packed it in and went home.  I had a great day of surfing, today.  I only hope that there's not a good swell on Christmas, as that will bring out all of the people who don't know how to surf that got boards for Christmas.

Whenever I go to another beach where I'm not a local, I am polite, respect the locals.  I never hog waves, and always hoot and cheer when a local snags a good ride.  I always avoid conflict, never snake waves.  If I've broken some local taboo, I offer my profuse apologies.  So far, I've never had any violence come my way in my travels.  I've surfed THE MOST LOCALIZED BREAKS ON THIS PLANET, and never had any problems.  I've always gotten my share of waves.  I've surfed the entire North Shore of Oahu from Haleiwa to Pipeline and Sunset and never had a problem.  I've surfed Windansea in La Jolla which is pretty localized and never had any problems.  I surf the Zoo they call Sebastian Inlet at least a dozen times a year and have never had any incidents with locals.

To all of the tourists, Orlando people, and everyone else.............we will welcome you to surf at our spot if you act like a human and show respect.

Happy Holidays

Aloha,

"event","I was playing in a huge poker game on Thursday night. It was a great table filled with both tight and loose players. There was only one player who was marginally decent, the rest were fish.  We were playing dealer's choice, and the game was running very smoothly.  I was in my passive-aggressive playing mode and really confusing the other players.  Since the games we were playing were pot limit, as soon as I built up my stack, I used it to clobber the other guys.

We finished up the game playing a little Hold-em.....I hate that game.

I was dealt Ah,Kd and was in sixth position.  I hate getting that hand, for statistical reasons I won't get into here.  Anyway, I just wanted to limp in to see the flop.  There were only 2 raises before me, so I raised and everyone saw me.  No reraising?......hmmmmm.  The flop came Ad,Kc,Qc.  I've got two high pair, enough to stay in......maybe.  The round of betting before the turn card had a couple of guys drop out, and a couple of raises. I checked into the raisers, cautiously biding my time. The turn card came and it was a As.  I had my full house and had to try to get as much money into the pot as I could.  There were only 2 other guys in the pot and I had them chasing flushes.  Both guys raised, and I checked each time.  There was no way I was going to raise that puppy and scare anyone outof the pot, especially guys who were chasing flushes.  The river card came and was a 4c.  I could automatically see that both guys made their flush.  I was glad for them.  Guy #2 bet, guy #5 raised him, and I came in and raised the entire pot.  Guy#2 checked, guy#5, who didn't have anymore cash on him, said,""Would you consider my boat worth $2500?""  I said, yes, of course.  He then put his boat into the pot.  Both guys ended up making their flushes.  The guy who put his boat into play had an Ac,3c he thought he had the nut.  The other guy had his highest pocket club as a Jc,7c.  I turned over my Ah,Kd and thought both of them were going to have a heart attacks.  No one made me for the full house.  The losers actually criticized me for my bad play, saying that I played the hand poorly.  I didn't even bother to reply to that.

Today is my day off, and I have to find a way to get an old Cal 25 that has no sails, and is in poor condition over to my parents house where they have a nice dock. Considering the condition the boat is in, it will cost about $3000 to get it into tip top shape.....That last hand should do it.

And they say that people never bet the ranch anymore.

I will try to get some pictures up later today or tomorrow of my newest toy.

I need some help.  I'm trying to figure out what to do with my crummy little website.  I use Yahoo as my host and I have a total of 75 gigs of storage space.  I have about 40 gigs of transfer a month, so that's a lot of space.  I would like to create a blog, but don't know what software to use.  I need something that's easy(I'm really computer illiterate), compatible with Yahoo, and looks good.  I also need to know how to advertise a blog in order to get some readership.  How do bloggers get readership in places other than LJ???  I plan on writing more along the human interest lines. My goal is to update about 3-4 times a week.  I have already written 9 articles to get it started.

Any feedback would be appreciated as I know some of y'all have experience in this field.


Wish me luck.

"event","I finally have the day off.  I'm going to spend it studying until 4:30 when low tide comes in and the waves will be pretty good.  Then I plan on surfing a little.  

Work has been a bitch.  I'm doing some housecleaning in my department, and am having to pick up some excess work due to the fact that 5 people have left in the last 2 weeks.  This is a good thing.  In a nutshell, yesterday I went into work at 4AM and got out at 10:45PM.  Long day.  If anyone is looking for a bakery job, is able to show up on time.......let me know.

I'm having some minor surgery on my foot on Tuesday.  Nothing big, but I will be able to walk without pain for the first time in a year.

I'm still fucking around with my website................it's pissing me off as much as torts does.  Speaking of.......I've found out that the body can live on 4 hours of sleep per night for extended periods.


Y'all take care

The question is about sub-domains.  My host tells me I can create up to 200 sub domains to make a more professional site.  What the hell is a sub domain?  How can I use it to my advantage?  Where can I find out more?

"event","My best friend Jimmie lives over in Cocoa Beach.  His beach condo was flooded with 5 or 6 feet of sand.  He lost everything.  The county condemned the entire structure and it has to be torn down.  His insurance company is being real slow in paying.  He is currently living in a trailer courtesy of FEMA.  In short, his life sucks right now.

I talk to him about 2-3 times a week, and we see each other on a monthly basis.  When I talked to him on Friday, it was our usual conversational chit chat between close friends. Without missing a beat, he said,""My dad died on Tuesday.""  How do you respond to that.  I offered the usual sympathies etc.  He said it doesn't matter as his dad was a dick.  I asked him about services, he said there were none planned.  He kept repeating the fact that his dad was a dick etc. I kept saying how sorry I am.  Suddenly, I could hear his voice break , then he started sobbing. That just ripped my heart out of my chest.  I let him go on for about 45 minutes, just listening, being a friend.  Ever since Friday, that's all I've been thinking about.

Jimmie is one of the finest human beings that God ever put on this planet.  He would give the shirt off his back to a total stranger.  He's a gentleman in the old fashioned sense of the word, and treats all with the utmost dignity and respect.  He opens doors for women, never gossips, gives much time to charitable causes.  He's the first responder to a friend in need.  Mere words cannot describe how good this man is.


I am taking a couple of days of personal leave to go over to Cocoa Beach and sit in that little trailer with Jimmie, and be there for him.  I'm giving him one of my boards....his were lost in the hurricane.  I have an old wetsuit that will fit him and I'm going to give him that also.  I'm going to make him do a few dawn patrols and cleanse his soul with a little surfing.  I think that I will be able to start him on the road to his recovery.

Aloha,

Jeff

We made so much food, we could feed Nigeria.

Today is going to be a total chill day with a little surfing later this afternoon.  I'm making a standing rib roast for this evening with all of the trimmings.  

I'm still in my country rock mode.  Been listening to Frummox a lot.  I guess it's the redneck in me.

"event","i havent updated in a while, i haven't properly updated in this. Basically, all my entries that were written within the last like month or so---were all typed within like 4minutes. so excuse those. anyways, these past few weeks have been stressful,fast, and good? only like 8 more days of school left , then finals week. this saturday is the SAT again, and then on the 9th,[next next sat] is the ACT. i really shouldnt have signed up for either of these tests, but i dont know. lets hope i do good, shall we? Hmm, i dont really know what else there is for me to say. Ive been trying to keep the weight off, which is hard, trying to do it the healthly way, much harder. So yea, ive come to the cross-roads of trying to figure out&nbsp; my future, as in college, my life. and i'm completely stressed and blank. i know i have all summer and even next year to figure it out, but i need to get a sort of idea of what i want NOW. im considering going to nassau for 2 years then transferring. i think thats the easiest plan. I feel somewhat bad because it seems like im ""settling, and giving up"" when im not. i know im much much better than going to nassau, and im capable of going somewhere MUCH better, but of course--&gt; $$$$ is crazyy these days. sigh, ive been feeling kind of lonely lately, even though im not. me and john have been good, more than good, and im so happy that we are doing much better than how we were like 2weeks ago, even last week. i spent my memorial weekend with him basically, it was really good--really didnt do anything at all, since it was so hot, but it was not wasted time, on Thrs. we went to see pirates3 in the cityy with his friend brady and his cousin age, it was good, i thought that movie was good. i was soo tired, so i stayed over j's house. basically slept right when we got home, soo humid outside. then friday,woke upp, left round 10ish, only to return to a day of just sleeepingg all day at his casa. saturday, we went to the central park zoo!! mucho fun, all the animals were cutee, essp. the PANDA FOX&lt;333 sooo cute,i want one NOW. but also ----&gt; very very hot. ummm after the zoo, we went to eat at someee food place in the mall across the street from central park, i had a yummmyy lunch consisting of tuna salad, pasta thinggys, VEGAN DUMPLINGS&lt;333 and a piece of chicken hah. yepp yummyyy. after lunch , me nd jhhhhhhy took a nicee nap on the grass in central park, wit my nice towel thingyyy...the weather got perfect after that., hmmmmm round 8ish, all the resturants were crowded like crazyy, so we left the cityy, and got back to his house around 10? 9:30ish? ,ate leftover chinese/pizza? haha, thennnnn watched night at the muesuem!! which was a good movie, except i fell asleep at the end :X

the next day--&gt;sunday,i woke up--and went home, then like 3hrs got picked up by him and his parents/sister to spend the day with them @costco, and ihop, andd having dinner at their house. mhmhm, hmm then went home around 10:3oish, thennnnnnnnn....next day, [monday] had the memorial day parade at like 830am, then got home around 10:15, thennnnn, took a showerr, and got food for me nd jjjj nd went to his house round 1:3oish-2. and basicallyyy spent the whole day with himmmmmm doing nothing :D

i just realized tho, its so sad how like his parents and sister are so nice to me, and like how i just wish my parents could just know john and like accept him and his familyy. but of course-my mom didnt like the lipring, and since he was older than me, my mom didnt like it, so for the past like 6 monhts i had to lie bout him, keep him nonexistant to my mom, and its just sotiringg making up excuses and lies,and sneaking around here and there. essp. since john lives across town, and doesnt drive. so its so hard. but wutever.

"event","well lets see, this week has been quite relaxing to an extent. i barely remember anything occuring starting from monday to today actually. and its already wednesday. Thank God. Tomorrow shall be thursday,and then it will be friday, where i can relax and be happy just cuddling wit jjj. i cant wait. well anyways, this week didnt contain any tests or alot of quizes or even homework. simple paying attention and classwork, which i felt really was unnessacary, but im not the teacher. anyways, tuesday was food-day, the day that i DREADED. The moment i walked into my 3rd period classroom with my dumplings, i saw the many upon many dishes of brownies, cupcakes, cookies, pasteries, bagels, rice, plantains, RAINBOW COOKIES &lt;|3 and some delicious spanish cheesebread and some philipino cake thing that was beyond delicious. it was such hell for me. i tried my self control method, but failed. in the end, i threw out my lunch and did not eat till dinner when i got home. NO MORE food rampages like that again. anyways, so ive been working on my stomach alot lately, i need to fix it so i look nice in my junior dinner dress without the gross fat sticking out, yuck. so recently, ive completely skipped lunch, since thats when i eat alot, and its such unnessacary, plus it gives me more time to read my book, but i do eat, let me reassure you. i just eat when i get home, plus i can eat a super big dinner too :) dpending of course on if i feel that hungry. its okay i suppose, not GREAT, but its life. and you gotta do what you have gotta do. ms.poko really offended me when she somewhat yelled at me bout not eating a cookie, in the beginning of class then mentioned it again during. i dont need people to tell me to eat or that im not eating, when i do. Its annoying, because it seems like its so easy for me to do this, when its not- oh hell, its not. its clear-cut out pain, but i mean im managing, acutally i feel better about myself somewhat, i have alot more time to myself. and im content with that. so i dont know, next time ill flip on someone who bothers me about it, because it really does offend me now. i dont need help because im fine. but thanks anyways, [not trying to sound rude] anyways.&nbsp; Lost is on again, hopefully this ep. will be good. Ive been reading alot lately, finishing a book a day, and now im going to read , ""the wedding"" by nicolas sparks, it looks good, its a loveeee story, haha. 

i cant wait for friday, theres a possibility that im gonna have a sleepover with my baby! :D 
i hopee so ,i just want a nice simple night relaxing and cuddling and just talkingg, without having to go out and do unnessacary things. i like talking alot, just because i hardly really talk during the week, so i always have so much to say at the end of the week, ha. nothings ever really interesting tho. hm, so yea i hope i can sleepover, and even if i dont/cant, then ill still be fine with seeing him even for like 5 hours. any amount of time, even 15 mins, is enough. anythingg.
this month is our 6month! i cant wait, because i really thinkk that its important, because its sooo wierd how like in the summer, i completely HATED the idea of love or caring or trusting or even being happy. and then randomlyy one night i added him on mspace,..[thanks to heather] [hhaha myspace] but yea, and now ..like almost 6months later, we both care bout eachother alot. im happy about that, i deserve to be happy. even though john doesnt really..treat me the way i treat him, its okay. i mean i never expected us to be perfect. but iknow he cares, and thats good enough. so that is why i do completley out of my way- silly- but cute things for him, and for march23rd, im planning something so kiddish, and cute that i cant wait. hopefulyyyy he'll like it or think it was a cute idea. if not, ill prob. be really embarrased, but yea, im putting alot of thought into this.. i would like to say my idea since i doubt john doesnt read this ever, but eh, ill just keeep it inside my minddd :)


&nbsp;i cant wait for atlantic cityy!! hopefully laruence can go, then it will be perfect, because christian will be able to go, and then it wld be amazing! ahhh..cant wait, TAFFY&lt;3333 ahhh..hopefully it will get warmer too, its been way too cold lately, and i dont like it at all, it even snowed! hopefully it wont turn to ice, please dont turn to ice, i HATE ice.

anyways, this is a long and dull entry, but i had to update, im content today , bye"

You turn around and see him in his most peaceful, innocent, and vulnerable state. He breathes as though the weight of the world lies on anyone's shoulder but his own. You smile, kiss his face and turn around. You form an involuntary grin on your own face, and then you feel an arm wrap around your waist and you know it doesn't get any better than this.

"event","its amazing how oneday can turn into an amazing one. and thats why im completely happy and satified with today in all of its wierd and simple aspects.well actually this morning was quite horrible. it was comprised up of complete mood swings, yogurt, crying, refusal to go to the mall, no working out, more eating, and crying.. oh yea and reading. i woke up so early today, so i had alot of time. around 2ish i left to go to heathers house, so i could leave from there to go see john. i felt bad but i explained to heather bout it, and she couldnt understood, im really glad im friends with heather, shes understanding as well as someone i can rely on if i ever need help. that makes me glad because im running out of people like that in my life nowadays. i left her house around 2:3oish and walked from there to johns, of course i was quite paranoid the whole time that i would get caught and also i cant cross major streets! its horrible, i have such a fear against it. but i figured that if i wanted to spend my day with john i had too, so i did. i wanted to go to mandees, but turned down the wrong street, and didnt feel like going back around so i just got me and john pizza and garlic knots, so he could have some food when i saw him. his mom came back today from hongkong! she was there for a long time, im not sure if it was 3weeks or a month, i think it was a month. maybe more, but i could tell that everyone was happy when i arrived at johns house. i felt bad for interrupting them while the mom was unpacking her stuff and giving her gifts to john and his sister. but johns mom is really sweet and got me a hat from hongkong, i felt that as the nicest thing someone recently&nbsp; has done for me. of course i turned it down but she insisted, and just to know that she wanted to do that for me, made me glad. johns parents are people i can rely on now. i mean its somewhat awkward when im alone with them at dinner or when johns upstairs getting ready, but in the end, i mean i try my best to be a good girlfriend for john and i hope they know that i care about him alot. i try to show it, but of course i know my limits on showing approperiate attention in public. [ i spelt that wrong]

anyways, after eating pizza it was around 3:3oish, so we sat around his living room with his parents and sister, looking at the stuff johns mom brought home, and just relaxed. eventually they all went upstairs, and me and john relaxed also. just talked reallyy, i like talking to him. and beingg sillyy..we then decided to play some fighting game on his ps2, which i won 7 times..and he won 21. BUT I PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT, monkey girl&lt;33forever. anyways around 8ish we left to go to dinnner, at some place by roosevelt mall, i believe its called..""grand deluxecafe?"" either way, it was like an hr and a half wait, so we ate round 9:3oish, and it was huge and pretty. alot of people waiting too. dinner was really goood. we spent like 4 hours in that resturant, so i got home after 12am. but im glad. because i got more time to be with john. im happy about that.

"event","lets sum up the past 2weeks in a short entry comprised of less than 5000 words. virginia was boring and just a waste of time.&nbsp; seriously right when that saturday had began i knew that the week of my winter break was already to hell and that if i wanted to be happy and relax, i would have to bare with all the grueling painless hours of driving and hearing rosey ramble about whats wrong with me and her son. For the rest of the week in virginia, i followed a routine inwhich made me feel more numb. i woke up around 10am, ate cereal and yogurt, did my pilates, around 12ish- i would walk over to the gym and stay there till 2:3oish. after 2:3o, i would return back to my unit and eat a piece of bread wit half a piece of american cheese. ocassionally an apple. after lunch, i would lay down with my stomach fat and my numbness on the rather large bed, that could use another body. for hours it seemed, i watched tv, mindless television shows on tlc and health discovery. around 7, was dinner. i ate probably my body weight in lbs of food, then rested again infront of the tv, leaving it for a 3omin hot shower. after my shower, it was back to my faithful companion tv, from 8:3o to 10, is where my mind wandered off into the dark and returned shortly around 10:3o to a phone call from john. after my phonecall, i would go to sleep. repeat this whole lifeless routine for 3days straight. on the 4th day, i went shopping then to the chinese buffet, again im a food fanatic. i got some good clothes. amazingly, i am now a size 3/4 in jeans [stretch] when i use to be a 7. acutally a large majority of my jeans are size 9s,8s,7s, and one 6. so now im glad to have jeans that fit without having to put holes in my belt every 3weeks. i only got one pair of those jeans sadly. but i picked out a nice pair of new shoes. at the time, i was on the verge of losing my mind, so what do you do? you go fucking crazy. you just let loose and smash your skull into the wall,HOPING that maybe you'll end up in a hospital. [or something along that meaning, if you're understanding anything im saying] anyways, the shoes, are obnoxious. lime green with brown checkerboxes, gorgeous all and all tho. i could have had other dark greens tho, which suit me more, but i decided that im already gross, i might as well be a clown. or something in that profession. I dont feel like talking about virginia much longer so basically, i could have saved you the trouble of reading this unnessacary paragraph about my boring week, but i felt it nessacary to remind myself of my lifeless patterns and daily mishaps. 

the saturday i returned, i saw john. but first i went to heathers and hung out wit lareunce christian and all them for a while, and left when john had arrived. i was happy or content. then again, what the hell is the difference with being content and happy now-a-days? eitherway you're not feeling sad or numb. i think thats the best way to put it. then again, how do i feel now.
i dont remember saturday night, it probably was a nice simple relaxing night. 

monday-thursday of this week, was quite boring and not needed to go into detail about. those four/five days were built up of tests,quizes, homework, reading, working out, eating too much, feeling gross, annoying people, and just complete numbness. friday [today] was pleasantly agreeable. i can say it was a good day, even though i decided to go home after seeing john [ i left around 6:3o, due to the fact that he had to go into the city]. yea so i made the decision to go home to workout ,eat dinner, and sleep. wasting a friday night. but what else is there ever to do, and who is their to see? ..why do i feel like i lost a large majority of people to hangout with and talk too. and its sad, since half the time, i do want to hangout with this person or that person, but i choose not to, since i feel it would be wrong of me to come back into lives that already had accepted that i was gone. but i dont blame them, i would dislike me too. im not quite caring and i can say that im selfish, and for those two behaviors about me, i suffer my own punishment of misery and regret. but time moves on, and in the end, i figured that i would figure out something. again, im not sure of how to fix this problem, but going to sleep and spending time to myself is good enough for the moment. today was good though from the hours of 4-6:3o, i got to see john and i had a good time doing nothing, but just relaxing, i was somewhat tired, but we both managed to stay up while laying down and just talking. i like when we talk but relax, i like it when i know that theres someone i can talk too, without having to side-think about the fact that i fucked up that friendship too. 

so now im sitting here typing this long unnessacary entry, about what? i have no idea. why would i even need to update about my life? it seems boring, i dont have the ""went to the mall today, hung out wit so and so, got drunk, had soo much fun xoxo"" type of night/life. i dont have anything really. i try too hard now to focus in school and just to isolate myself so i dont have to feel guilty about something else. i hate mirrors and i hate the idea of getting all together and hanging out, when we all know that doing that, i could never go back to how i was. but who knows. my problems problems problems. 

i like reading now, alot. i read at lunch so i dont have to eat, but in the end, i end up eating since im a blob of non-talent and a poor-mind of clothes and shape. oh well. at this point, i give up. this week was good though. i didnt feel numb, or sad. i didnt even think about myself or my feelings, ive learned now to block out whatever i feel. i now think about food or reading 20/7. not 24. 20. for the other 4hours, thats when my mind is at rest, trying to ease the pain of a rough day of selfish thinking.

indulge yourself- but with moderation.
im saving all the fortunes i open from the cookes.
i have so many now lying around my room, just hoping that somehow i could just drop in the pile and become microscopic, so i can bury myself in the deepest cracks of my ceiling. 

so that no one could find me hiding."

"event","well today was mildly okay. i wasnt sad nor happy, just somewhat there and content. school was basic, it was beyond freezing throughout the building though, i wasnt pleased with this, but again- what can you do? So anyways, woke up normal time, somehow i managed to get a gross and painful scab/cut on my ankle, its not big tho, thank god. i think i might have scratched it with my other foot in the middle of the night? who knos. maybe it wouldnt have hurt either if my damn pumas werent so tight. anyways, ice ice ice was everywhere and i HATE ice. only one more day, then i can seeee john, and just see him. i need to just relax. all i do now is read, with im acutally okay with, the books im reading are interesting to a degree, leaving the rest of it just questionable. i like how people write and think. it makes you feel okay to write how you feel and how you are today. not that i ever have much to say anyways. moving on, i dont remember much about school, somewhat a blurr, quick and simple. took an easy chem test, and thats all i can remember. i took out the book, ""shes come undone"" which is suppose to be about this lady who is overweight like 240 lbs,and it deals with her struggles with her weight and her feelings. i have a feeling im going to love this book, due to the fact that i LOVE how people feel about situations. not like basic feelings like : mad, sad, happy or okay. i mean i like the REAL indepth information. anyways, ill read that book over break, i wanna finsih my english book , speak by tomorrow, which ill get done somehow. and then over break im gnna try to read 3 books, but probably will just read 2. i have nothing to do in virginia anyways, so i might as well read and workout. sigh. nothing is improving, im looking the same, and i dont know. im tired and sore, i just need to relax. 

i really just plan on going to virginia, and crawling underneath the covers and sleeping all day, till i feel comfortably numb or not even there. which will help make the week go by faster. i was considering on buying sleeping pills, so i can just sleep a large majority of the time, but i cannot locate any. so ill just hope that the sandman will let me rest. ill have my sidekick with me, so ill have some sort of communication with new york, and ill also have my cell phone. but in reality, i want to just somewhat, ""die out"" , just disappear for a week, doing nothing and feeling nothing. so then when i come back, maybe ill be empty enough to just start over again and start over fresh. im surprised that my grades arent horrible yet. i hardly pay attention in class, and all i do is read. maybe im just lucky? or maybe im not really thinking the way it seems.

i like writing. i cant seem to write though on paper, ive tried all day, and i just cant. i dont know if theres some sort of shortage of blood flowing to my finger tips, or if my brain just refuses to signal my bones to inch forward on the paper. who knows.
who knos who knows. after school i went to the library, and nearly fell asleep in the little 3 walled cubicle. i like those desks. they make me feel away from the school, and in my own little corner. i can read and write anything i please without the fact that im in open sea. it was annoying though. i kept trying to read and just student after student would not shut up. i could hardly pay attention to my reading, that i somewhat gave up, and rested my eyes for a little in that warm space. Of course, theres always someone who comes out of the shadows and attacks me like some sort of shark...this person would be known as Matt. who had appoached me only to wake me up from my quiet motionless self.&nbsp; i so badly just wanted to repose myself into some position where i can be stressfree. I dont know why, i took notice of this library adventure so much. Even the librarian knows me, thats nice i suppose. Or maybe im just a nerd.

eh, well i finsihed my dinner and showered, i have to finish christians card, i decided to not get him a birthday card, because why be serious? when we all know that im not really a serious person. so i went to the silly meg in me, and asked her to help me out. which she came through. i tried writing alot but again, i lack in this department. Well 8:5o, and im tired. i want to sleep, but i probably wont till 2. so for now ill get a glass of diet sunkist, and a speical k bar, and rest my body on my bed where i can read, or maybe ill just sit at my desk and think.

both ideas are appealing. but i think too much, and i never figure anything out. so why think?
all the books that im reading too arent answering any questions. i still dont understand why people get randomly depressed and commit suicide or why do people conceal their feelings inside and bury them deep enough so that it just 'goes away'.
i wish i could do that. past things come up now and then, and i think ive already dug so many graves in my mind that theres no more space. So im just swallowing and swallowing thoughts and memories and words, and just throwing them back up. over and over and over. i wonder if maybe eventually these things will go away,and i wont have to pay for my mistakes.

or maybe ill just be regret #2., then again, i do regret it very much so, but i do love the company.
well the misery that comes with the gift. its like one of those magazine ads, where theres always a secret price to pay.
im slowly repaying mine now, but it seems like im in debt, and my punishment is to live with this undieable thought and only i can answer it and get rid of it.

i wish it wasnt so hard."

"event","ive been feeling rather not me. why? i dont know. But i can probably list out a few things that might help apply to this sadness. but ill just keep it inside. its much more easier too anyway. So ive been reading alot, just to kill time, since i seem to have so much pointless time in my life. The books ive been reading are somewhat interesting, not really inspiring,but give me a sense of just being aware of life. and people around me. The bell jar kinda affected me a little, 'esther' was suicidal, but why? it didnt make sense, so i kept reading and just thinking about it. and sometimes i dont get why people get randomly sad out of no where and choose to take their life. I dont know, i kinda have the same routine everyday of the week, same feeling in the morning, same in the afternoon, and same in the evening. its a repeating process, and only on the weekends, is it somewhat different. <br /><br />anyways, so this week has been very numbing and interesting-[as all weeks of course] monday was simple. i dont remember how monday was, so ill just make up some perfect day that i would have liked to have happen.<br /><strike><br />monday: Monday was great, i woke up feeling great, got up and got dressed. everyone was happy. everyone wasnt complaining due to the whole idea of 'school' . Classes were easy and quick, and i understood the information right away. No one seemed sad. No one seemed troubled. after school, i went home, had no homework [meaning now stress, just relaxation] so i took a nap till 6 , took a shower, and ate dinner. after a good dinner where i fullyy enjoyed it, i watched tv. and ended my night feeling happy.</strike><br /><br />monday. was depressing, lonely, and lost. didnt talk to anyone really, just read. after school ..i went home to excerise till 7. ate dinner,shower, online /thinking. then read, some tv ,sleep.<br />tuesday, was the same, as was wednesday... i cant really say im sad, because i dont know how i feel.<br /><br />thinking hasn't really been good lately, just ideas that make no sense to me, so i look deeper into it, just wondering how it occured and why. and how can i fix it. other things in my life aren't great either, but im putting in alot of effort to somewhat fix my mess of a life.<br /><br />i figured that im going to die eventually, might as well, figure myself out before that should happen.<br />ive gotten pale. and im losing hair lololol, i literally laughed wen this occured. i dont really sleep surprisingly.<br />this week ive been up thinking, or reading, i like to read alot. it has comsumed my short yet boring life.<br /><br />ive been cold, mentally and physically lately. and ive trying to keep some sort of postive thought, but oh i do think postive.<br />i hardly think that the use of being 'negative' comes out of my mouth.. <br /><br />i believe i speak in half truths. half the time i say something true and then ill say something false. its interesting, sometimes i catch myself doing this, but i wont stop myself, because i myself dont even know which is the lie and which is the truth. <br />like the other day, i had said soemthing and walked away, just trying to figure out whether or not i acutally believed in doing this. and sadly, i couldnt figure it out, its as if my mind was playing some sort of mind-game with me. <br />so i just walk it out, by walking away. and then my mind resets into another round of hell.<br /><br />hell hell hell hell hell hell special k is hell hell hell excersise is hell hell hell love is hell hell hell.<br />i suppose. this whole entry is somewhat written from whatever forms out of my mind. it makes no sense of course, and i dare not read this entry after i finish, so maybe after all the words are gone, there will be no more confusion<br /><br />there will be no more numbness.<br /><br />of course im not numb, im just here, i like to walk down the hallways when its time to go to the other class, and i like to just walk. not talk -&nbsp; not think, not be, just walk. and just watch how other people react to their lives and the situations that fall into their laps. i wonder how they feel about that, and if they know that they dont have to deal with it,- should it be too difficult to accomplish.<br /><br />or maybe their just happy, and are okay with whatever God gives them. I dont know, im fine, im content. i cry alot though, and i dont know why. i like to lay down by 8:3o, but usually fail too. so i spend hours awake thinking. i want to write in a notebook, but feel like that is too difficult for me. This whole internet writing is easier, my eyes dont need to see my fingers, and i dont need to look down at the words the form from ideas oozing from my brain. <br /><br />i never wrote like this before, i never wrote this much and i apologize in advance for this entry being so long. its just nessacary for one now and then. Maybe this entry will save me from a horrid solitude or grey shadowing. Or something along those lines. <br />well, what else to say? or think? ooo..so much more, but some of my thoughts should not be shared, and i feel the sentences that would form from my mouth would cut like razorblades along this monitor. no, ill keep it secret, ill keep it inside.<br /><br />and evenutally it'll go away. something has to end, you cant keep going on feeling lost. except im not lost.<br /><br /><br />im just here."

"event","so im sitting here thinking that i dont give john alot of credit for being a really good boyfriend
and i should. well anyways, i feel like im soo annoyingg to him and that im so complicated, and its really amazing how he puts up with it. half the time im the one that says the wrong thing, and that leads to a fight but then other times its reverse. i dont know but im happy with him. im not happy with myself but im happy with him. anyways so i realzied that hes so nice and caringg. seriosuly.
like i always talk nd write bout him but the thing is i can never end an entry and have that WHOLE thought explained out, because its unexplainable. he accepts me for me, which i dont kno why that hasnt gotten thru to me. i dont need to lose any weight for him because im perfect to him, and i dont need to worry bout my looks bc to him im beautiful, and idk about you but that is probably one of the like classic sayings that all girls like die to hear from a guy, essp one who really means it more than anything. and i dk its just hard for me to get it, i feel like i dont deserve it and that theres so many other nice girls who look for guys. idk wuts wit me, but now that i realize, maybe change will come? or..maybe ill just post this entry, and go watch stepford wives :)

"event","i havent really ""updated"" in a while. partially because ive just been so busy and my lifes been so hectic&nbsp; even though i hardly do anything interesting. well last weekend was good, the same as usual, seeingjohn, and heather and nicole nd chirsitan and lareunce, umm then monday came and we had school whihc sucked, but its okay because school was only mond and tuesday this week since midterms are wed,thrs,friday and i take my SAT on sat. which im SOO SOO worried about, ive never gotten anything higher than 1500 lol so it goes to show , my asian blood comes to no use. anyways, so today was tuesday, basic school ,some review nothing interestingg..then randomly ivana asked me that if i wanted to go wit her to get her nails done so i cld walk wit her, so im like sure , bcuz then i wld be able to walk from rockway towards central and see john, i figured i wld only have like 30 mins with him but luckily i got like 2 hrs, and thank you to the nail place :) and ivana. im so glad i got to see him, you dont even understand. i was upset for a couple of days since me and him dont seem to talk that much anymore and it seemed just different, and then even yesterday on the fone he told me how he wld be more busy-er and might not be able to see/talk to me that much starting next week due to him goin back to school for his classes and his job in the city, and that upset me since i hardly see/talk to him ALREADY, what more time can i possibley lose? :( so i didnt say anything to him, i was crying about it, nd i was really upset, because it ujst sucks to start to like someone knowing that theres a complete possibility of getting hurt, and then risking everything and putting everythng you have into the relationship. and like im glad for john, but like im also so scared inside. i finally admitted to myself that i care about him so much and i do love him. but now like if we wont get to tlak that much anymore..how can i expect him to love me the same amount as he does now? how do i expect myself to also? and maybe im too paranoid and i think too much into these things, its just im so scared of getting hurt when i already dont have much to look forward too. but anyways

from 3:31-5:3o ish [i like to remember times], me and john simply just spent time together, basically just cuddling and talkingg bout our days, and just regular stuff.. then of course ate pringles nonstop, ha [15 for 70 calories, since i bought the 50%less calories, fat free pringles which are amazingly gooooooooood, go buy them! ] nd it was just so wierd, just both of us, laying in his bed just eating pringles and making faces towards eachother and laughing. it made me really happy. and hes so cute too, i never really ""looked"" at him like truely, whenever i talk i always look at him then kinda look away, not purposely, i always do that to people. so today i just reemmber him eating the pringles nd like..being able to lay down and swallow them when for me it seemed soo difficult, and idk he just looked so adorable. im writing so much, but this update is nessacary.

anyways i was sad to leave him, but it was time well spent and im so glad i was just like ""fuck it"" today and walked from south to central basically in my oversized jeans and my white trash long sleeved shirt, along with carrying a bag with like 5 lbs of books in it. and i did it, in the freezing cold KNOWING that i probably only had 30 mins to spend with him. and for some reason i was thinking as i was walking there, ""what am i doing"" and i realized that i cldnt have been more happier then to spend those 3o mins [which turned out to be 2hrs :) which im soo glad about] with someone who wanted to see me as well, someone who finds happiness in me as i do in them. i know im writing alot of stupid stuff and its probably somewhat funny i guess? since im serious, but i dont care, because alot of people dont understand what kind of relationship i have with him, and how its so hard to see him and balance out my life also, plus worry bout getting caught CONSTANTLY. but everything happens for a reason, and the people who are in your life now might now be there tomorrow, so spend as much time as you can loving whatever you have.

anyways, ive been eating yogurt in the morning now and half a cup of dry special k for breakfast, yogurt burns fat, and this yogurt happens to be 60 calories! ..plus ive been DEBO working out crazyyy.. i dont really need to focus on my stomach, just my legs nd arms, nd im TRYING TOO..but its sooo damn hard.

"event","i spent the whole day with john, starting from like 3:3o till 1:3o am :)
and i couldnt be happier with that. we basically chilled the whole dayy, watched tv,..basement/room, umm. then
his parents took us out ot dinner to boulder creek, and it was good. im really glad johns parents are so nice, his mom is just soo sweet and kind. his dad is just jolly most of the time and funny. but like i think the most perfect moment of the whole day was when we were coming back from dinner and we were in the car, and i just looked at john. and i didnt even have to say anything, but i just felt happy. i dont know if that makes me wierd for like deeply looking at him or if u dont understand but all i know is that i wish i cld have just froze time to just take a mini clip of that moment. nothing happened, ntohing had to happen, but for some reason it was really meaningful to me. it was simple and it was heartfelt...[ im pretty sure john had no idea that i wasdoing this, which i guess is embrassing now if he ever does read this lolol ] but anyways it was just a silence that wasnt awkward, just a complete minute of being in the prescence of someone who understands you and who cares about YOU, not what you look like.

this break was good, really good, i got to see him alot more than i usually get too, and most of the time -we dont do anything, but i love each minute of it, from watchingg raptor island with his parents to watching the military channel [which both sucked lol] it was still just a gooood time..sadly i wont see him till at least friday :(
but anyways, im just glad i got to see him for new years. his friend brady came over nd we just chilled nd watched tv, bradys really nice. um anyways, i got to celebrate new yrs 07 with john! &lt;3 and i couldnt have been happier.

well anyways, then at like 6 i went home nd then went out to dinner wit ayesha and ivana at like 7:45, i got so much food, like...veggie soup, and french fries&lt;3 and salad boo..but it was delicious, and now im tired,

"event","so i made a new livejournal, in order to start over NEW again. its almost the year of 2007, and im in 11th grade, and to be honest- alot about me is completely different than it was in the summer 06. Alot of things have changed and alot of problems and loss of friends have occured. Inorder for me to say what excatly happened, would take forever and quite frankly, i feel no need to state any of it. But to sum it all up--&gt; girls are bitches and boys are jerks. ha. its the truth. I had alot of friends in the summer, i lost some really close ones only to my regret of losing people who care about me the most.&nbsp; Ive probably gotten in a billion fights with rosey and i have yet again went extremely over the phone bill. Anyways, im still close to the 5 people ive been close with for a while, and im happy. well i think im happy, then again, how do you know if you're truly happy? I dont think you do, you never will, because wenever you think you're happy, something bad ends up happening- in which it changes your mood. im writing alot for my first entry, i really should start this on new years, but oh well. Anyways, i have no friends on this yet, and i dont think i want any on this livejournal :) 


ive been talking to some of my old close friends lately, and im really glad to be, i missed them. i can understand though if they dont want to hangout or talk to me again--i mean i made the stupid mistake of leaving them. my regret. but anyways, im going iceskating with them 2nite,and with john &lt;33 ! :) im happyy

"event","I have recently fell for Bjork. No joke. I still have LSD-like flashbacks of the video she had out back when I was in highschool...something with a huge moth and a teddybear. At any rate, I tend to be slow on the uptake of the more pop-y music fads, Bjork being no exception. So when I started listening to a mix made for me back when I was studying for the boards and moved through the Portishead (also good, but not independent of the most memorable experience I heard it in so difficult to tell if I like it for its own sake) into the Bjork sections and actually listened...and...damn, it's beautiful. I've been listening to Joga (see lyrics below) on repeat for a couple days now, even during my opiate run to CVS the other day (ah, a story for another time, perhaps) it was just the most soothing way to let go of the anxiety that I had somehow enveloped into myself from my patients. I need to learn how to deal with that better. At any rate, I needed to put these in a place to remember, and figured I might as well share them although I do realize this is a poor excuse for a post. I also figure that since I haven't really written in a long time, there is little anticipation surrounding such things :)
I just find Bjork's style so fascinating. The lyrics to this particular song also strike me in the same way Tori Amos talked about ""Case of You""...when I actually read them, I felt like they just described this state so perfectly...so...so...in that e.e. cummnings kind of way, in a sense...simple with a flavor of the profound. 
And I'm in such a good mood despite having a lousy day...I'm mostly crediting Ari and $50 worth of sushi right now, and the excitement of change soon to occur. Either way, I need to get back to studying for tomorrow's shelf exam, but before I curl up on the couch with my CaseFiles and a package of sno-caps, I will leave you with this, and encourage the Itunes download. It's worth the $.99

<I>All these accidents,
That happen,
Follow the dot,
Coincidence,
Makes sense,
Only with you,
You don't have to speak,
I feel.

Emotional landscapes,
They puzzle me,
Then the riddle gets solved,
And you push me up to this

State of emergency,
How beautiful to be,
State of emergency,
Is where I want to be.

All that no-one sees,
You see,
What's inside of me,
Every nerve that hurts,
You heal,
Deep inside of me, oo-oohh,
You don't have to speak,
I feel.

Emotional landscapes,
They puzzle me - confuse,
Then the riddle gets solved,
And you push me up to this

State of emergency,
How beautiful to be,
State of emergency,
Is where I want to be.

"event","it's sunday morning of a switch weekend -- i have printed out papers and papers on HIPAA and infectious disease controls and a quick glossary of medical spanish in anticipation of my upcoming sites. I was incredibly saddened by leaving on Friday; my friends who have been through this already give me jaded looks and make fun of me...turns out you're *not* supposed to grow attached to patients. particularly on the psych ward. 

but i have found a space in the medical world that i enjoy, shall bookmark it for the time being and move on with an open mind. i've learned a lot from the depressed 14 year olds and borderline 16 year olds and psychotic 17 year olds and PDD 9 year olds and saw my own fears shift into focus as a patients weapons were found and he pulled out a cord in front of me muttering about strangling people to death. i watched my idealism sink as patients that were once thriving were given a sort-of medical sedation in the form of high-dose antipsychotics but then got to feel that same idealism bob to the surface again at seeing a boy who a couple weeks prior could see no purpose in life enough to try to end it, smile. i learned how life experiences shapes all of us and the myriad of different ways we learn to cope...and how these manners of coping can box us in to making the same mistakes again and again. 

it's all fascinating, and i was blessed to be with an attending with whom i could immediately bond over our npr-listening and sushi-eating ways (much to my surprise), and to be able to go through this experience with a few good friends who i could depend on (and vice-versa) for support in the more murky experiences of the month. 

end result of month one? mentally holding a place in child/adolescent psychiatry to check out some more next year...and the mixed feelings of fear and excitement that i just may find something i love about each rotation."

I haven't updated in awhile...things have been really crazy in a lot of ways. But I caught up on reading and you're all so beautiful and interesting and thank you for writing things & sharing your lives and etc. :) 

So in a nutshell:

My apartment is in continual flux with a new company taking charge of the building and not doing anything with that new-found control except for increasing our rent (and doubling my parking fees!) 

My cat had surgery and her biopsy came back with a mast cell tumor. I am hoping it's a one-time deal, we're experiencing the joy of post-surgery medications and putting my foot down with vets. 

I passed another semester (yay!) but i continue my love-hate relationship with med school. We're currently on the kidney, so that is all I ""know"" for the time being. I attended a rather interesting talk on being a pro-choice physician today...lots of things to file away in my list of possibilities for when I grow up. I still *heart* infectious disease (yes, you read that correctly). I'm psyched to add it as an elective.

My entire philosophy/beliefs on relationships have been turned around...well, perhaps not that dramatic, but a lot in part due to some welcome surprises, there were some unexpected breakthroughs/realizations and I'm in a rather good place at the moment with that. As a side note, I've also decided, a'la <U> The Unbearable Lightness of Being</U> combined with the experience of it, that just about the sweetest thing a guy can do is hold your hand as you sleep. Strange, yes, I know. Nonetheles...

Follies band with its associated time-suckage will start soon. I miss music terribly; I rekindled my love with the piano over Christmas break, and have been unable to give it the attention it deserves. I've been fiddling about with an acapella group at school but due to time constraints don't think that will be a lasting relationship. 

I think I've set Gilmore Girls aside for the time being to focus my limited study break tv time on Sex & The City. I've also discovered ""Lush"" and the resultant amazing, sparkly bubble baths. I'm ****dying**** for a concert. A *good* concert. A 'I will completely lose myself in the music' concert. If anyone knows of any such things, give me a shout-out. I was introduced to ""Death Cab for Cutie"" (I know, I know, another late find, just like me and my love affair with Radiohead) and have fallen in love all over again. Bjork's new CD is pretty fabulous as well...all acapella. Fun. 

I also found the best sushi place in DC. This is serious. I went with my friend Jeff last Sunday and am still daydreaming about it. I mean, I've been sushi-deprived thanks to my broke-ness (I think the last time was post-finals?) but this was amazing. Sushi Ko. If you are within a plane ride of it, you must give it a visit. 

Beyond that I'm just biding time until spring break when I get to visit Jordan in London :) Hey, is it March yet? 

OK, a bath and my renal notes/highlighters are calling. Send me updates! I miss my non-medschool world, and am sorry for my going into hiding! 2nd year is all they said it would be..."

you wouldn't try to put the ocean

then you go out and do it

is just to see each other through it

we don't know what each hour will deliver
we just call it like we see it
call it out loud as we can
and then afterwards we call it all water over the dam
maybe the moral higher ground
ain't as high as it seems 
maybe we are both good people 
done some bad things
i just hope it was okay
i know it wasn't perfect
i hope in the end we can laugh

we make our own gravity to give weight to things
then things fall and they break and gravity sings
we can only hold so much is what i figure
try and keep our eye on the big picture
picture keeps getting bigger
and too much is how i love you
but too well is how i know you
and i've got nothing to prove this time
just something to show you
i guess i just wanted you to see
that it was all worth it to me</I>"

--Lisa Mueller

<I>
Doctor, you say there are no haloes
around the streetlights in Paris
and what I see is an aberration
caused by old age, an affliction
I tell you it has taken me all my life
to arrive at the vision of gas lamps as angels, 
to soften and blur and finally banish 
the edges you regret I don't see, 
to learn that the line I called the horizon 
does not exist and sky and water,
so long apart, are the same state of being.
Fifty-four years before I could see 
Rouen cathedral is built 
of parallel shafts of sun, 
and now you want to restore 
my youthful errors: fixed
notions of top and bottom,
the illusion of three-dimensional space,
wisteria separate
from the bridge it covers.
What can I say to convince you
the Houses of Parliament dissolves
night after night to become
the fluid dream of the Thames?
I will not return to a universe 
of objects that don't know each other,
as if islands were not the lost children
of one great continent. The world 
is flux, and light becomes what it touches,
becomes water, lilies on water,
above and below water,
becomes lilac and mauve and yellow
and white and cerulean lamps,
small fists passing sunlight 
so quickly to one another 
that it would take long, streaming hair
inside my brush to catch it.
To paint the speed of light!
Our weighted shapes, these verticals, 
burn to mix with air
and change our bones, skin, clothes
to gases. Doctor,
if only you could see
how heaven pulls earth into its arms
and how infinitely the heart expands 
to claim this world, blue vapor without end.

"event","<I>...It was a love that one day might be lost, but that is always the risk we take in loving...</I>

It's about 3 weeks into fall semester of my 2nd year of medical school. The reading for our first ""Doctor, Patient and Society"" class from <U>The Measure of Our Days</U> has me moved to tears. I think they select the readings to do that; it works better on an over-stressed, sleep-deprived individual, but when I become <I>that</I> person I rarely have time to do these readings. At any rate, while I cannot pretend to empathize with Cindy, the AIDS patient in the story, nor the many people who have said much more significant and unexpected good-byes in the past few weeks particularly, the concept of ""goodbyes"" strikes a somber chord with me right now. 

After hugging Ali and Vivek good-bye earlier this summer, I felt the need to immediately distract myself...fortunately that afternoon being able to do so in the arms of a good friend with a good movie, but the pain of distance remains despite the distractions. Saying goodbye to Jordan today was somehow surreal as we have lived within hugging distance for as long as we've been friends, and I've taken for granted this would continue even as we went our separate ways. I didn't account for an entire ocean disrupting that. The goodbyes signaled necessary shifts in the momentum of our lives and are very positive in very many ways -- I do not wish to detract from that...but having loved ones far away is always difficult. 

But then, the concept of love -- I suppose this summer has had its moments of honesty...of telling those I love or that I was falling for exactly that...not always that relationship-y kind of love, but that of the closeness of family or dearly trusted friends. In some cases I suppose this led unexpectedly to unspoken endings. Again, inherent in such an ending is the sadness and rejected feelings, but the absolute-glowing-happiness at realizing my own capability to feel such love was worth the hurt of rejection. And the possibility of someone else knowing they are loved I think...well, suffice it to say fear is not a worthy reason to keep those who I feel such positive things for in the dark, even if there isn't a concrete reason to express that love or direction for it to move in. Once I get over my own feelings of vulnerability, I realize it's just a nice thing to know and feel, so why the hell not be honest about it and allow someone to feel that way? To hope, to love...truly what makes life worthwhile.

A few days ago marked the anniversary of my Grandpop's birthday. He passed away my freshman year of college, and I found the card I received from him and my Grammy on the same day that I heard the news he had died. I read the saved poetry that he had written for me at crucial times throughout my life...all sparked by the letter I received in the mail from Grammy with details of Grandpop's time in the Army during WWII. In essence, a ""final"" good-bye that turns out not to be so as he remains constantly in my thoughts and prayers...in a way he feels closer than when he was a 4-hour drive away. Perhaps goodbyes are not endings, then. 

So what of goodbyes, and what of love...? I think any further words right now would cheapen my thoughts on the matter, I feel things getting confused and muddled through words, already.

Finally, I know I've been remiss in updating this journal and think I'm going to leave it be. This may change after hours cooped up in the library with no social outlets, but for now I would prefer personal interaction over mass informing. I fear things I've written in the past were taken the wrong way by the wrong people, and don't want this to be a passive-agressive form of communication.
Anyway, we'll see...perhaps this is merely a phase and a new year's hope to being more productive and less distracted by my computer! Pharmacology, pathology, microbio and infectious disease, and psychopathology are unforgiving in the time they require...and who knows what else this new start will bring...

"event","my apartment feels to closed in, too cluttered. i have been frustrated and overwhelmed by the task of cleaning out and started a week ago on my bookshelves. i was able to cut my folders from undergrad in half, having a few main categories: 
1. <I>musical didactic tools saved for the day i inevitably become a music teacher</I>
2. <I>marine bio stuff that i will reference when i blank out on basic facts and freak out</I>
3. <I>ego boosting materials</I> 
4. <I>russian lit that makes for an enjoyable read</I>
5. <I>sentimental crap</I> 

i've discovered a major cleaning out is kinda like doing one of those little puzzles when you move around the squares to get numbers in order when there's only one space to move one square at a time -- you know, the cheap plastic ones you could get out of restaurant wishing wells when you were a kid. so rather than being overwhelmed, i realize that everything is a chain reaction. as soon as i finish the bookshelf, the others will quickly follow after, and then the pile of music that sits in a crate in between my bookshelves, my computer desks, etc. 

however, i suck at focusing on one thing at a time so i have moved on to my CD collection. very tempting to pull a high fidelity and arrange them autobiographically...but maaan. that would be kinda...depressing. i realized that all the dopey guys in my life who have disappointed me have also introduced me to awesome music and once i can strip their remnants from each album, i appreciate their presence in my life for that purpose, if nothing else. but to go back and think of where each album has its place in my life, while yes, strangely comforting, would also be maddening. 

sooo, at the moment i'm taking a break from the looming CD project (all CDs are now arranged alphabetically into pop/rock, prog, folk, classical, jazz, personal compilations, soundtracks, ambient/world) and having my breakfast of kix & apple jax while listening to last night's tower impulse buy which i substantiated by my general grouchiness towards my parents for being hurtfully stand-offish these past couple weeks.  for what it's worth, music works. i'm feeling much better. 

painting also has amazing therapeutic value. i need to do that more often. 

back to the cleaning :)"

There is a laundry list of funny experiences and jokes and phrases and the like that I suppose all occur along a road-trip/wedding weekend which 4 girls spend bonding which I will likely type in to retain for all posterity. in all honesty, i'm exhausted and about to flop onto my couch with something to eat but i shall sign out with a link to <a href=""http://www.worldslargestthings.com/easterntour/teapot.htm"">the world's largest teapot</a>. we discovered this thanks to a newspaper we picked up in west virginia when we stopped for food...according to the article (which provided entertainment from west virginia into maryland, mind you) this teapot is in fact <I>taller</I> than the great wall of china! 

the great wall of china (i just looked it up) is 25 feet high. i will refrain from making totally snarky comments about using this as a comparison for height being that even the bank of china in hong kong is taller at 1209 feet...and i'm guessing the majority of the readers of this local paper do not have a clear image in their minds to use as a reference. 

yeah. i nearly peed my pants while reading this article.

"event","Ah. My apartment is a wreck...haven't slept in my bed for the past 4 nights because there's stuff all over it which may or may not directly have lead to the head/neck-ache i woke up with. augh. 

Sooo yesterday was a very fun Jodan's birthday :) We hit up Hershey...and I don't know how it's possible but I forgot how much I love roller coasters...and tilt-a-whirls...and water rides...and amusement parks in general. And there was chocolate AND we found the really yummy italian place for dinner that I've gone to with my family in the past. It was a perfect sunny and not crowded day. *And* I was tall enough to ride all the rides. Really, what more matters? :)

Sadly, I am still yawning as I type right now. We're soo getting old...we were exhausted by the drive home. 

Today, apparently, needs to be much more productive -- cleaning this am. and then a meeting about big sib stuff and then picking up my step-mom at the train station and then a late mcsc meeting and perhaps some jazz to follow or perhaps not...I can't believe I leave for Kentucky in a few days! I still need to find a dress and I think an alter-ego who enjoys weddings. This will be the first in recent memory which I will not have flute in hand. I will seriously not know what to do with myself. 

Well anyway, I should get moving. I'll leave you with the words of wisdom I was reminded of yesterday:

<I>Hershey's chocolate, Hershey's chocolate it's a Hershey's chocolate world....if you're the travelling kind...wherever you roam...you'll always find...a friend from home...Hershey's chocolate...real milk chocolate (Hershey!) the great American chocolate bar...</I>"

"event","i had good intentions of writing when i got home last night. it was the final irtapella party and it was sad although i don't think i realize quite yet i won't be seeing over half the people from the group ever again nor will we ever sing together as we were again. i suppose it's good and bad. time to move on...and yet the group was definitely a comfort and a fantastic musical release throughout a really tough year. besides which, i should look on the bright side that a few of the people i have become really close with will be sticking around. not that i'll have the time to spend with anyone next year, apparently *sigh* 

it seems like the crap associated with school is starting early -- after leaving various messages trying to get in touch with people, finding out *just* the day before that we have a meeting tomorrow. a hundred emails back and forth over what should be a simple task. i practically don't want to check my email anymore since i know i will be met with 20 emails on the same topic when i *do* check. why is basic communication and respect so difficult???! anyway, i don't want to end up ranting about this. it is summer. there is no need to feel stress right now. 

but back to last night...being generally sad as i drove down wisconsin ave. towards home...paying special attention to the guy sitting by himself on the front steps next to the only 24 hr diner-typed place in georgetown and curious what his story was...smiling thinly at the most likely drunk guy waving me towards the bar he was going into...thinking how coldplay and ben folds' <I>missing the war</I> were good driving away music (driving away from what? i'm not entirely sure...something about missed opportunities and bittersweet reserve). more and more i realize my own fears are getting in the way of something potentially great...ah, i'm just not ready. or something. mmph.

"event","...this entry is prefaced by the disclaimer that i am a HUUUUGE dork. 

so, jordan and i went to a phillies game yesterday for his bday. it was fan-tab-u-lous. despite getting stuck in traffic on I-95, we made it there in the 3rd inning? maybe 4th. i don't totally remember, but we made it in time for a 0-0 game against the nationals that the phills won in the final inning with 1 out, bases loaded...ah. it was exciting! and i came to the conclusion (with more than a little help from jord) that i must remain a philadelphia fan even if i have lived in dc for quite some time now. my loyalties must remain with PA. especially if i keep going to games in philadelphia and don't want to get beer poured all over me. gak. anyway, the stadium is really beautiful and quite the switch from vet stadium. but then we chilled on south street and a good time was had by all. 

but yes, my dork moment. so i was standing in line for the bathroom after the game, listening to the tolling of the liberty bell as they do at the end of a winning game and trying to isolate the note of the liberty bell from all the background music/noise. i found that i mentally kept dropping the note a third which i assumed to be ""C"" and then realizing it was a minor 3rd, i figured the liberty bell must toll an E-flat. then i decided this was incredibly silly because i never had perfect pitch and despite my best attempts probably wasn't *really* hearing a ""C"" in my head for comparison. and then we were on our way to getting dinner and there was this snapple billboard on the side of 95...one of those with the fun facts under the lid of the snapple caps and <I>this</I> fun fact happened to be ""did you know the liberty bell tolls an E-flat..."" to which i screamed out ""THAT'S SO AWESOME!!!"" much to the shagrin of my passenger who was like ""Wha--"" 

And I double checked online <a href=""http://www.ushistory.org/libertybell/facts.html""> here</a> and...okay. well, the stadium might not be that accurate, but i shall go on thinking as much. cuz to me, this is very cool. 

anyway, i should get showered and such for dim sum con el vegi trio :)"

Yay. I have my tickets, like, fo' real. So excited. 

In other news, I learned what ""dialate"" means in case you read the angsty Ani lyrics in the previous post. Keep in mind I'm not feeling that angsty, I just really like those lyrics. Each verse kinda has its own place in my past or with someone from my past, true, but I don't think I've ever felt it all at once. 
Anyway, I learned that dialate doesn't just mean to expand which makes the whole song make so much more sense.

i have no words of comfort nor insight nor anything of value to put here therefore i will be a waste of space with unabashed self indulgence.

---------------------

every so often the angsty girl in me needs a fix. ani usually does the trick. so in honor of tonight's conversation brought on by tequila, being self-absorbed and cleaning out the remainders of my undergrad life, here are the lyrics we were trying to think of...

<I>life used to be life-like
now it's more like showbiz
i wake up in the night
and i don't know where the bathroom is
and i don't know what town i'm in
or what sky i am under
and i wake up in the darkness and i
don't have the will anymore to wonder
everyone has a skeleton
and a closet to keep it in
and your mine
every song has a you
a you that the singer sings to
and you're it this time
baby, you're it this time

when i need to wipe my face
i use the back of my hand
and i like to take up space
just because i can
and i use my dress
to wipe up my drink
i care less and less
what people think
and you are so lame
you always dissapoint me
it's kind of like our running joke
but it's really not funny
and i just want you to live up to
the image of you i create
i see you and i'm so unsatisfied
i see you and i dialate

so i'll walk the plank
and i'll jump with a smile
if i'm gonna go down
i'm gonna do it with style
and you won't see me surrender
you won't hear me confess
'cuz you've left me with nothing
but i've worked with less
and i learn every room long enough
to make it to the door
and then i hear it click shut behind me
and every key works differently
i forget everytime
and forgetting defines me
that's what defines me

when i say you sucked my brain out
the english translation
is i am in love with you
and it is no fun
but i don't use words like love
'cuz works like that don't matter
but don't look so offended
you know, you should be flattered
and i wake up in the night
in some big hotel bed
and my hands grope for the light
and my hands grope for my head
the world is my oyster
the road is my home
and i know that i'm better
off alone

i think today will be spent organizing post-doc-appt. i will at the very least take care of my bookshelf and finally get rid of all the folders that i've held onto since undergrad. is anyone else that much of a packrat? i mean, i'm sure at least a half hour of my day will be devoted to convincing myself that i no longer need my russian lit notes from 2002. *sigh* i have lots of yummy food 'though thanks to an impromptu grocery trip last night with <lj user=""aliwadha"">. 

and as for my schedule...okay. so i need to fit in quality time with ali and jordan before they leave, q-time with mom when she comes back, a wedding/road trip to kentucky, trip to nyc, vacation with the family in ct, time in dc with my bro' and my mom, a nationals game with mom, a beach trip, a week in chicago, chillin with my grandparents, musikfest, a trip to great adventure/hershey park, reiki training, getting in touch with a music therapist, being trained as MCSC secretary, arranging a bunch of acapella music, oh and that piano/flute practicing and studying i thought i would do...

"event","almost exactly 7 hours later with one stop in nesquehoning to drop off my grandmother i am back in dc. i am in this horrible exhausted and overly caffinated state. uggghhh. so i quick sat down to double check the rehearsal i sped home for is still on, and it is but a half hour later meaning that i need to do something to keep from falling asleep and missing it entirely thereby negating any purpose in my coming back to dc this early and missing seeing the holy grail in outdoor movie form back up in ct. 

my thoughts on the way down flitted about as usual, but i've been meaning to make mention of Ayreon for like the past week and a half. sooo...they're this band whose concept album had to take the place of marillion's because it was too damn hard to find (read: they didn't have it at either of the towers that were nearby in DC nor strawberries up in CT). at first listen, once getting over the Disney World ride-esque narrator which just makes me feel like i'm about to partake on a ride through the human body or space with a slew of 10-yr-olds, i was blown away by the music. i just could envision colors pouring into me with each chord progression. it was awesome...a similar first listen to that of transatlantic AND it had some killer flute (loooovee the call and response between the flute & keyboards a little over 7 mins. into the 3rd track) and some great melodies...

...but then i hit the 6th track which was just annoyingly happy. after many listens, it's starting to grow on me like a reminder of first discovering major-major 7th chords with their 'unicorns playing on the hillside!' quality. some of the melodies have become trite after a few listens, making me think of video game soundtracks. but despite these complaints, i give it a huge thumbs-up for some amazing moments of musical creativity that you can just sink into. oh yeah. the name of the album is <I>into the electric castle</I>. check it. 

i also rediscovered pre-sgt. pepper beatles this weekend as my family sang (or played) along to ""1"" as we hung around the living room a couple days ago. i am now inspired to arrange one for acapella with much bias towards ""all my lovin"" thanks to last night's conversation. i have a few ideas so perhaps i can get four or five songs arranged before the start of the school year. it is still a bit of a pipe dream to get a co-ed acapella group going at the med school, but we shall see. i'm wary of overbooking myself yet again between MCSC, manip/CAM interest group stuff and big sib among the amazing amounts of academics. sadly, i have none of this (yes, my ADD self has gone back to talking about the beatles in case you're not following my train of thought) on my ipod so i ended up putting on transatlantic's suite charlotte pike and remembering that i like them too. what a glorious day for music in the corolla.  

--------------

on a totally non-musical note, i've been having lots of memorable dreams lately that stick with me throughout the day. particularly relationship-y dreams of people who i had recently decided to forget. if only my subconscious could get on the same wavelength as my conscious self. grrr. 

and with that it is about time to leave for rehearsal. peace out."

"event","Today I had another one of those moments...the I'm-feeling-so-much-love-I-could-burst moments. I love my family. I'm really lucky. 

Anyway.

I just, finally, finished reading <U>One</U> by Richard Bach (of <U>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</U> fame). In somewhat of a striking coincidence, I started the book sometime before falling into medical school. I greatly enjoyed what I read up until the point where I was paused for nearly a year...there were many insights and intriguing ideas hinging on the perspective of life as a dichotomy of fear and love, an awareness of interconnectedness, an overall striving for a deeper understanding of thought and existance...

I mentioned a 'striking coincidence' in that I realize as I finish the novel post-first-year, I have a much different perspective which was an unexpected change. I feel that words are failing me at the moment, so bear with me! Admittedly I was annoyed by the 'cutsey' quality in the last few chapters. The ideas that caused me to dog ear page after page in the first half of the novel became more sparse and transparent. I found myself, rather than trusting the integrity and expertise of the author, to be questioning and growing annoyed with the codependent relationship depicted...

It made me think of conversations I've had with a close friend of mine...of the late night babbling on the phone variety where we somehow devolve into discussions of past relationships and all the cutsey things we would do and say and call our partners and such, and how when you're <I>in</I> a relationship it all seems to make sense but for all those in the world <I>outside</I> of the relationship, it just appears...ah, dumb. overly cutsey. nauseating. *blush* you get the point. But I definitely feel that quality in the book which I didn't notice before. I still regard many of the ideas within those pages to be profound, or at least thought-provoking. I enjoy the story's honest telling even when masked by cliche metaphors. But I felt frustrated by the 'us versus the world' attitude seemingly exemplified by the narrator...let's just say Mr. Bach has ruined the word 'wookie' for me for a rather long time. 

On the other hand, I am intrigued by Schrodinger's Cat...I know I've come across this before but it struck me at the right moment tonight, so if anyone has a strong grasp of that concept, shoot me a word :) 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In other thoughts, <lj-cut text=""stream-of-consciousness typing ensues..."">I slipped into my introspective walking on the beach mode. After my initial disappointment that my feet have lost their callouses and I can feel (rather intensely) the slipper shells digging into my skin, I came across the remains of a seagull-munched crab and realized I didn't remember the name any longer. I tried to console myself by the image of the plethora of new information shoved into my head over the past year causing previously existing and not recently used information to be squished in a corner of my mind somewhere or even falling out. I did finally remember that it was a rock crab (*phew*) and continued to quiz myself on long island sound water life intermittently along my walk. 

The memory lapse brought back to the forefront of my mind the career questioning. I accept that whatever career I choose will shape my life and be as much a determinant of my life's direction as a way to earn money and feel useful in society. I will never be the 9 - 5 job type. And I question, with the concept of who I want to be becoming ever more clear with each new experience, why I am going in the direction of medicine. I pondered the three main career paths I'd like to travel down. One (obviously) being that of medicine. It seemingly makes a lot of sense as it appeases the needs to interact with people of many different backgrounds on a non-superficial level with the opportunity to help these people on a very deep level. Additionally, it boasts the ability to provide answers to an ever-questioning mind. Each day is a challenge, there is never an end to the intellectual stimulation. On the down-side, I don't know that I can do this without my whole heart being in it. Reading the ""big sib"" letters as I organized everything for a mailing to go out to the class of 2009 this week, so many people said how much they <I>enjoyed</I> their first year of medical school. I would not be sitting in that camp. Sure, I had many wonderful moments. I met some amazing people and had some incredible experiences. This is not meant to be read as flippantly as I realize the words are coming out on the page...truly, medical school is an amazing experience. But also a heart-wrenching one as I watch valued relationships slip into the distance and loves of mine (ie. music, marine life, reading & writing, art...) always too far out of my grasp. While I love the concept of being a physician, I struggle **greatly** with the ""all-or-nothing"" aspect that western medicine dictates. I also struggle with the concept of evidence-based medicine and the lack of a holistic perspective. I struggle with many of the people I'm surrounded by (or the seeming mentality of allopathic medicine) and their propensity to judge themselves and others on accomplishments and achievements alone and desire bigger-better-more and lose basic value in being <I>human</I> and no longer loving/enjoying things, instead, constantly being a skeptic...I realize how I've changed in many ways and feel a separation growing between myself and all those in my life who are <I>not</i> involved in medicine in one way or another. There's a necessary detachment that occurs, but it's not just in the operating room, it's not just with the scientific aspects of the body. It feels too much like a secret club and school itself feels too much like an initiation. They (who makes up this omniscient <I>they</I> anyway?!) say that it is all worth it in the end. I hang on to this belief, that the ends justify the means, that anything else will come easier after jumping these hurdles. But every day I fear losing the parts of myself that I value the most in this very process.

And what of the other potential career paths? Teaching music is one. I have written numerous odes to music in past entries so I won't digress into such statements here. I realize again tonight as I lay on the couch listening to my brother play guitar...and he asks if I know Eleanor Rigby on the flute and my fingers just kind of slide on to the right positions for the key he is in and it comes out without my knowing how or thinking about it in the least...much like my experience in Follies with Sweet Child o' Mine...I mean, it's a simple task. These are not difficult songs, I'm sure any bozo who picks up a flute could do the same...but then I feel a connectedness and understanding to music that I have taken for granted for my whole life. I am so empassioned about music and education and it comes so naturally...I was practically a secondary music teacher while I was <I>in</I> high school; I so quickly gained the respect of the music department in college without even <I>trying</I>...and please, by no means am I trying to feed my ego here, just marvelling over how in this realm I don't even think about things, they just happen while in my medical world I struggle and struggle to the point of tears and barely slip by in many instances. 

In the attempts of coaxing myself away from defeat and walking away from an incredibly expensive undertaking (on many levels), I tell myself that this is how growth occurs. One does not grow by stagnating in comfort zones. It is difficult, though, as I cannot help but wonder if I can better serve others by taking the road where my talents seem to lie...

Besides, to be a music teacher just seems like something that would be crazy amounts of fun. I mean, they actually want you to learn all the instruments...like, that is what you'd be graded on rather than scrounging around looking for random cheap instruments that you can get your hands on to learn like I've been doing since 5th grade. I know all the inner workings of education having 4 parents in just about every facet of the educational system. There are lots of things within this career path that would be frustrating and mind-numbing, but at the same time it could be so much fun and something I can see myself excelling in.

And then there's the third world...the one in which I think I was happiest of all my experiences. That is the world of marine biology. I think working at the aquariums was the one job where I would just not want to leave. I feel such a strong and inexplicable connection to the ocean and the life within it...I can think of few things I love more than exploring tide pools and wandering around during low tide and observing sea mammals or fish. I had such an awesome relationship with my marine bio professors (discounting the times at the bar in the Bahamas...we're not going to go there. I'm sure everyone meant well...) There just didn't seem to be a viable way to plan a life around a job as a marine biologist or working in conservation or research or the like...but then seeing the trials of other jobs since my experiences there, I wonder if the downfalls of that life are really so bad in comparison. The people I worked with at Mystic Aquarium seemed to love what they do...I was constantly reaching for more information, it is something I am greatly empassioned about...the research made sense...there is so much as yet unexplored, it is an immensely exciting field and one in which individuals have the opportunity for such a positive impact on their environment. 

*deep breath*

And in the moment, I feel a strong sense of freedom as if a weight is lifted off my shoulders at just the very <I>thought</I> of leaving the medical world for one of these other two options. Where does that leave me? There are so many other factors which I can't even reasonably get into right now that play into the decision...aspects of my personality that I want to change or that have already changed...realizing my needs and what is practical and what will ultimately benefit those around me the most...choosing what I want to grow towards, what kind of person I want to be, where my ultimate values lie and what will not lead to extreme frustration and regret which inevitably lead to mediocrity which is something my life can not become. And when do I stop deciding who I want to be in that child-like way of fantasizing about being a grown-up with a job and just <I>become</I> that person??

*sigh*

The musing did not stop at the thought of career paths. Relationships are an item constantly jumping on and off my mind. What attracts us to specific people? How is it possible to be strongly attracted to someone, to feel such a strong sense of love towards someone and yet know intellectually they will not meet your needs and any sort of relationship would be destructive? 

I read this article a couple weeks ago which mentioned the ""campsite rule"". 
Campsite rule?
Yes. ""...as long as you leave things better or the same as the way you found them..."" 
My mind immediately flickered to choice people who I don't believe <I>could</I> follow that rule even if they tried. But rather than blaming ghosts of my past, I am curious why I seemingly seek out these individuals. How is it that I can value myself perfectly fine as an individual yet I never can believe I would be attractive in another person's eyes (of course this other person's eyes being that of someone I greatly admire/am attracted to). And why is it such a game? With the lack of such a naiive outlook on relationships and a more intimate understanding of all the psychological aspects that go into a relationship and attraction and the like, isn't some of the magic lost and doesn't that, in a sense, cheapen things? It is quite the web...of needs versus wants versus loves versus fears...

And does any of it matter since I know when I fall, within my head I defy all logic and my heart becomes nearly impossible not to follow (except for when I become afraid)...

I suppose it all boils down to that in one sense or another. The love/fear stuff...the understanding of connections between people and the like. I suppose I shall not cast off Richard Bach so quickly...but the answers while I know they're all right here, they still seem so far away..."

...fortunately some kind of social conscience kicked in and after a thank you call to my grandma, i opened the door and went off to dinner and wolf trap and even made it up to the tail end (as usual) of a party up in bethesda and then quality time with some drifters who finally arrived at my apt. around 2:30a. 

so today has consisted of scrounging for food, returning the occasional phone call and convincing myself that getting up again after being awake at 8a. after 4 hrs of sleep is a really good plan...in fact getting to the smithsonian folklife festival would make it worthwhile and if not, the minor amount of music research i've done while watching gilmore girls should entice me out <I>at least</I> the 5 blocks to tower.

i also realize that i am not at my best spending time sitting by the (figurative) phone (or to be more modern, aim) and i shall do it no longer. certain people simply no longer exist in my life. i've been doing lots of introspection and mental cleaning out and while i suck at cutting ties, i'm not putting myself out there anymore. i mean, reaching out to strangers and people who are barely acquaintances is one thing, and is necessary. but needing to <B>constantly</B> reach out to people who are supposed to be your friends is another, particularly when they generally flake out and expect you to just understand time and time again. and this is not something i enjoy or appreciate. i'm sure no one does. but i need to not experience this any longer, so i'm saying good-bye to the one sided friendships and choosing to spend more of my time concentrating on all the amazing friends that <B>are</B> there. so truly, nothing is really changing except valuing myself enough to wait less on people who don't pull through consistently and value those who generally *do* pull through more. 

i don't mean to sound snobbish or anything. it's not a judgement on people's character as much as i find myself getting hurt time and time again by the same people and it makes me really wonder why i need to bang my head against a wall any longer to understand this. a mere shifting of energy, as such. 

i think i'm going to make some cookies for those who will be here tonight :)"

"event","sooo, i had checked out <a href=""http://www.viennateng.com/"">Vienna Teng's website</a> randomly and discovered she would be at the <a href=""http://www.birchmere.com/index.htm""> birchmere</a> yesterday. i had been there before to see john gorka by myself, so decided to do the same with vienna...she always brings out the introspective side of me...which i don't always like to be around other people for. i'm sitting down at my computer about an hour before the concert, on the phone with one of my former roommates and decide to double check that the music will start at 7:30. well the birchmere webpage gave more info. than vienna's...turns out she's <I>opening</I> for <a href=""http://www.marillion.com/"">marillion</a>. gah! (1) i've never gone to see an opening act before (although, according to my father, weird al opening for the monkees at the concert he took me to when i was 6 was a strong case for opening acts) and (2) i know very little about marillion -- their name always comes up whenever i read about prog music, but i've never quite been enticed enough to purchase an album. i have seen the bass player before and like him well enough, but realizing they have a rather loyal fan base of which i am not part of made me a bit apprehensive. marillion's being the main act also had me a bit worried by the ""doors open at 6p., limited seating' warnings so still on the phone (at about 6:50), i managed to get out to arlington and convinced myself if there were no more tickets by 7:15 when i would get there, i could take the consolation prize of chinese food and gilmore girls for the night. (yup tonight was to be an anti-social night...i was even trying to look tough all day with my broken social scene t-shirt and such). 

there were tickets, but i was informed that yuengling was on the <I>old menu</I> so sam adams and i were pals for the night. <lj-cut text=""after enjoying 15 minutes of people-watching..."">after enjoying 15 minutes of people-watching, vienna came on stage tentatively. i think...if i were to become a performing artist, i would be similar to her and felt this immediate connection to her on the stage. minus the chinese-american part. at any rate, she had a very honest presence. i really felt like i was hanging out in her living room and she was just playing around on the keyboard. again, she's not one of my all-time favorite artists. my mom gave me a CD with a song that apparently reminded her of me, and the lyrics overall are rather personal and show a deep sensitivity. casting aside some musical pretensiousness, i began to openly enjoy this CD, particularly since it hit me at the right time during this past semester. the keyboard melodies are simple but rather likeable, and she makes no pretense towards complexity...it's just not her thing. though i was a bit put-off by a couple self-depreciating remarks she made throughout her set, she was very enjoyable to watch and listen to. and please don't get the wrong impression from what i have written so far; she is a very good musician, but not someone who will stun you with speed and intricate musical knowledge. rather, she is someone who can mesmerize you with grace and sensitivity. her control/use of dynamics being one of her greatest strengths along with meaningful lyrics. i suppose just appreciate watching someone who obviously feels the music they are playing...even better when they can pull you in with them. i still have the haunting melody of the song she prefaced by saying <I>this is always a bit of a tight-rope walk for me</I> and detailed the after-effects of dying in a car crash. the only song she played from <I>the waking hour</I> was <I>Tower</I> which, over the past year, has more or less become one of my personal anthems and so i was all teary-eyed and such during that one (which just did wonders for my tough-girl image of the night). 

so post-vienna teng, i was getting psyched. i have been craving a lose-myself-in-music night since like, april. my expectations were growing and i was no longer in the mood for a sensitive keyboardist...just wanted something that would course through me and allow me to feel for a night and just uh, yeah. just lose myself within...complex time signatures, unexpected harmonic shifts, the whole thing. 

so, okay. i was a bit disappointed. 

to be fair, it was Los Trios Marillos (consisting of Steve Hogarth, Pete Trewavas and Steve Rothery) and it made me appreciate drummers *that* much more (in the absense thereof). all in all, they were good. i am now enticed to check out <I>Brave</I> at the very least, and give them more than the benefit of the doubt for the poor acoustics of the ""bandstand"" area of the birchmere. again, the show was of a very casual, sitting in their living room chillin' out kind of nature which i liked. the audience was a bit obsessive and had a great deal of trouble with clapping on beat (particularly in a flamenco style) and was <I>so still</I> which i never can understand. standing completely still and listening to music. hmph. but yes, back to the actual music :) Steve (""H"") was immediately likable and just eminated this sense of love that was contagious. he didn't do much with the keyboard this night, but his voice was smooth and he just, overall, had this engaging presence...you just couldn't help but smile along with him. His blue eyes also searched out the audience and I think he pretty well made eye contact with everyone in there for at least a moment (yup. with the eyes and the music i was gone. at that moment i had the sudden yet fleeting urge to become a groupie). Pete Trewavas is just...cool. I found myself actually watching him pretty much exclusively for the first third of the set. I was a tough sell on Steve Rothery since, unlike H and Pete T he just didn't seem moved by the music <I>at all</I>. perhaps it was an off night. he had some really enjoyable guitar moments (one that sounded oddly like the lead-in to the 4th part of <I>Stranger in Your Soul</I> but, whatever). overall, it was enjoyable, but not as emotionally charged as i had hoped. perhaps just because i didn't know the music beforehand, and who knows when i hear the whole band (yes, i'm making a trip to tower today) how my feelings will change. </lj-cut>

I think my favorite line of the night was during one of the encores when H was talking about ducks (as he was throughout the whole night) and marvelling over the fact that you never see ducks in trees. Pete was just like <I>you don't think the webbed feet have anything to do with that?</I> and then they were contemplating over owls and the like. rather amusing :) 

All in all, you could tell they were creative musicians with a genuine passion for what they do and (at least for H) a strong social awareness that they work in rather un-obnoxiously. That I just have to respect. I shall save most of my musical opinions until I hear some more.

I scraped up my car on the way into my garage last night. @#$% this is going to take some getting used to. 

Anyway, I should move on to cleaning my apt. so that there is at least a chance of 5 people fitting in here tomorrow night..."

"event","<lj-cut text=""relationship advice that seems to pop up now and again..."">

*definitely* to be taken with a grain of salt, but there are some good points...

You pick the wrong person because you expect him/her to change after you're married.
The classic mistake. Never marry potential. The golden rule is, if you can't be happy with the person the way he or she is now, don't get married. As a colleague of mine so wisely put it, ""You actually can expect people to change after they're married... for the worst!"" So when it comes to the other person's spirituality, character, personal hygiene, communication skills, and personal habits, make sure you can live with these as they are now. 

You pick the wrong person because you focus more on chemistry than on character.
Chemistry ignites the fire, but good character keeps it burning. Beware of the ""I'm in love"" syndrome. ""I'm in love"" often means, ""I'm in lust."" Attraction is there, but have you carefully checked out this person's character? Here are four character traits to definitely check for:

Humility: Does this person believe that ""doing the right thing"" is more important than personal comfort? 
Kindness: Does this person enjoy giving pleasure to other people? How does s/he treat people s/he doesn't have to be nice to? Does s/he do volunteer work? Give to charity? 
Responsibility: Can I depend on this person to do what s/he says s/he's going to do? 
Happiness: Does this person like himself? Does s/he enjoy life? Is s/he emotionally stable?
Ask yourself: Do I want to be more like this person? Do I want to have a child with this person? Would I like my child to turn out like him or her?

You pick the wrong person because the man doesn't understand what a woman needs most.
Men and women have unique emotional needs, and more often than not, it is the man who just doesn't ""get it."" Jewish tradition places the onus on the man to understand the emotional needs of a woman and to satisfy them. The unique need of a woman is to be loved -- to feel that she is the most important person in her husband's life. The husband needs to give her consistent, quality attention. This is most apparent in Judaism's approach to sexual intimacy. The Torah obligates the husband to meet the sexual needs of his wife. Sexual intimacy is always on the woman's terms. Men are goal-oriented, especially when it comes to this area. As a wise woman once pointed out, ""Men have two speeds: on and off."" Women are experience-oriented. When a man is able to switch gears and become more experience-oriented, he will discover what makes his wife very happy. When the man forgets about his own needs and focuses on giving his wife pleasure, amazing things happen. 

You choose the wrong person because you do not share a common life goal and priorities.
There are three basic ways we connect with another person:

Chemistry and compatibility. 
Share common interests. 
Share common life goal.
Make sure you share the deeper level of connection that sharing life goals provide. After marriage, the two of you will either grow together or grow apart. To avoid growing apart, you must figure out what you're ""living for,"" while you're single -- and then find someone who has come to the same conclusion as you.This is the true definition of a ""soul mate."" A soul mate is a goal mate -- two people who ultimately share the priorities, values and goals.

You choose the wrong person because you get involved sexually too quickly.
Sexual involvement before the commitment of marriage can be a big problem because it often precludes a fully honest exploration of important issues. Sexual involvement tends to cloud one's mind. And a clouded mind is not inclined to make good decisions. It is not necessary to take a ""test drive"" in order to find out if a couple is sexually compatible. If you do your homework and make sure you are intellectually and emotionally compatible, you don't have to worry about sexual compatibility. Of all the studies done on divorce, sexual incompatibility is never cited as a main reason why people divorce. 

You pick the wrong person because you do not have a deeper emotional connection with this person.
To evaluate whether you have a deeper emotional connection or not, ask: ""Do I respect and admire this person?"" This does not mean, ""Am I impressed by this person?"" We are impressed by a Mercedes. We do not respect someone because they own a Mercedes. You should be impressed by qualities of creativity, loyalty, determination, etc. Also ask, ""Do I trust this person?"" This also means, ""Is he/she emotionally stable? Do I feel I can rely on him/her?

You pick the wrong person because you choose someone with whom you don't feel emotionally safe.
Ask yourself the following questions: Do I feel calm, peaceful and relaxed with this person? Can I fully be myself and express myself with this person? Does this person make me feel good about myself? Do you have a really close friend who does make you feel this way? Make sure the person you marry makes you feel the same way! ""...Do I want to be more like this person? Would I like my child to turn out like him or her? ..."" Are you afraid of this person in any way? You should not feel you need to monitor what you say because you are afraid of how the other person will view it. If you're afraid to express your feelings and opinions openly, there's a problem with the relationship. Another aspect of feeling safe is that you don't feel the other person is trying to control you. Controlling behaviors are a sign of an abusive person. Be on the look out for someone who is always trying to change you. There's a big difference between ""controlling"" and ""making suggestions."" A suggestion is made for your benefit; a control statement is made for their benefit. 

You pick the wrong person because you don't put everything on the table.
Anything that bothers you about the relationship must be brought up for discussion. Bringing up the uncomfortable stuff is the only way to evaluate how well the two of you communicate, negotiate, and work together. Over the course of a lifetime, difficulties will inevitably arise. You need to know now, before making a commitment: Can you resolve your differences and find compromises that work for both of you? Never be afraid to let the person know what bothers you. This is also a way for you to test how vulnerable you can be with this person. If you can't be vulnerable, then you can't be intimate. The two go hand in hand.

You pick the wrong person because you use the relationship to escape from personal problems and unhappiness.
If you are unhappy and single, you'll probably be unhappy and married, too. Marriage does not fix personal, psychological and emotional problems. If anything, marriage will exacerbate them. If you are not happy with yourself and your life, take responsibility to fix it now while you are single. You'll feel better, and your future spouse will thank you. 

You pick the wrong person because he/she is involved in a triangle.
To be ""triangulated"" means a person is emotionally dependent on someone or something else while trying to develop another relationship. A person who hasn't separated from his or her parents is the classic example of triangulation. People can also be triangulated with things as well, such as work, drugs, Internet, hobbies, sports or money. Be careful that you and your partner are free of triangles. The person caught in the triangle cannot be fully emotionally available to you. You will not be their number one priority.

"event","i'm back in PA for a couple days and watching lots of DVDs. this is how it seems to happen. we eat, we watch movies. it is the PA way. not to say that is all we do...running with the dog in our nice big backyard was fun...and also the realization that when i'm home and it's summer, shoes are vastly overrated. 

feet are sooo cool. 

i also got me a new drivers licence. 

what is on my mind, although diluted at the moment since i just finished up a completely unrelated phone conversation, is the <I>pay it forward</I> movie/mentality. i was left with a lot of questions...but i think to focus, one of my favorite quotes (and one of the few i could find after the movie) was:

<I> I guess it's hard for people who are so used to things the way they are -- even if they're bad -- to change. 'Cause they kind of give up. And when they do, everybody kind of loses. </I>

and it resonated a little too clearly within me when helen hunt makes the comment about how she won't reject kevin spacey since he won't even give her the opportunity to do so. 

yes, a bit cliche, but i still like that a lot of the ""paying it forward"" came from people doing kind acts that were not large in scope, but large within their own sphere of growth; the most touching examples in the movie were ones like when helen hunt's character goes to her mom to forgive her for all the hurt that built up over the years. i really admire that type of deed because i think it is one of the most difficult. in the spirit of the movie, there is so much that needs to be said to so many people...directness and honesty just simply need to be more of a priority. i know it's more complicated than that, but fear really needs to be less of a driving factor in relationships. and i can think that all i want, but putting it into practice is fucking hard. 

unfortunately, the lasting impression of the movie wanes as my own sleepiness sets in. here's hoping that the resolve can somehow build up again and last for the next.......week, at least. it can be my birthday wish of sorts...i still haven't blown out my candles..."

though i did have quite the bittersweet night...our irtapella recording session (for which my voice was shot so i'm not especially looking forward to listening to these...except for the 'hidden tracks' mwah-ha-ha!) was followed by strawberry shortcakeness and random hangingoutness for the last time in Chris's apt. sad, really. and the irtapellians made us these really super nice picture frames. i nearly cried. and then following that there was lots of quality conversation spent with two of my favorite people. 

milkshakes were served.

i spent the day letting randomness take over, fitting in enough necessary things (ie. finally taking care of bills/loan consolidation/etc.) to feel like i accomplished what i set out to do today and...strawberry picking. 

strawberry picking is awesome. 

ok, i know. *everything* has been awesome lately. i feel kind of like i have been freed from imprisonment and am looking at the world through new eyes! (yeah. dramatic much?) it has been brought to my attention that i am easily amused. i guess i have decided a few things: 1. i like to giggle and i plan to do it as often as possible 2. i can keep myself busy quite well and with quite the variety of wonderful people; life is good 3. there are many many things i want to do and get involved in and there is no time like the present to do...everything and finally, 4. things are as fun as you make them. i have spent enough time being judgemental and jaded. i would rather just enjoy things for what they are. no, i will never be able to turn off that judgemental voice in my head, and with good reason, but i will not purely submit to its bidding any longer :) 

also, in the admissions recently made (as mentioned in the previous entry) there is also, admittedly, a pain creeping up on me that i suppose is the necessary evil that accompanies such things and is far too similar to the one that caused me to turn off in the first place. well, just one more thing to work through, i suppose. at least i can feel...at least i am aware. i will take that, and this time, not run."

well, i had a moment today. i was taking a friend up on a ride on his motorcycle...as we wove through tree-covered roads and i was able to feel the wind and had my arms wrapped around him...how do i describe? i don't know. perhaps it was the green of the leaves or the freeing feeling of the air sliding across my arms and back...maybe realizing the level of trust i have in such friends...all the anxiety just seemed to slip away. all the fears, gone. it was a <I>fun</I> i had before forgotten; a fun remniscent of summers in PA...the feeling of days that seemed to have no end...the feeling of grass between toes and a sky that reflected the boundlessness of each day...a sense of everything that is necessary to life being encapsulated in such a day...nothing necessary out of reach. 

i am just sitting here, finishing up some pasta primavera and wine (sadly, i can't deal with sweet wine anymore. ick.) and skimming through <I>Finding Neverland</I> from the start since I missed it while cooking and pulling pieces of glass out of my foot. but my thoughts are just <I>calm</I>. Today was just so *nice*. I did some cleaning, met up with a friend who's birthday was today for tea in Dupont...wandered up to the NIH for an MRI...went for the aformentioned ride...read quite a bit on the metro to and fro...had phone conversations with people who I haven't spoken with in awhile...generally enjoyed the sun and good company. 

yes, life is good. 

and in moments like this - rather - on days like today, i feel like i found an answer to the question of what has been nagging me...although as per the last post, i have yet to find a fitting song :) 
...but i just feel <I>ready</I>...ready for...a new adventure...to love whole-heartedly...to realize what i have been afraid to acknowledge. it's all at my fingertips and in between suddenly and finally my heart feels open to possibility...feels ready to accept a new challenge...

...i just feel love. for no apparent reason, just that it exists.
and i again <I>believe</I> that it in fact, does exist. 

until i figure out what to do with that, exactly, i'm going to go fall back into the movie :) 'xcuse me..."

"event","the kinda funny thing about me is that i always need a song to move through things emotionally. i've been spending a lot of time in my car lately, singing along to random things. i'm looking for the perfect song to describe what i'm feeling at the moment, and it has yet to hit me. there is something about finding that perfect song and singing it emphatically over and over again that is catharctic in such situations...and there is certainly a good deal of unrest until i find/hear/write something that fits perfectly. it is especially difficult right now without my ipod. @#%*& 

soo, the excitement of this weekend has been going out with my girls last night...starting out at cafe citron (very fun place...complete with shots on the house at the end of dinner to convince us to stay!) and then moving on to my friend's lovely rooftop poolside and then adams morgan...i don't think i even know the name of the last two places we went, but it was fun and today has more or less been a day of recovery. it was great to go out with the girls...a very sex-and-the-city-like night. a very good thing every so often, and it has been awhile :) it was also a nice release after being at the NCAM conference on manipulative med. for the preceeding two days. very interesting...well, i think it's best to leave it at that. after our last irtapella performance (*sniffle*) i was left rather sad and generally emotionally drained. singing various random musical tunes on the way back to the metro was helpful and all, but i definitely needed the night out. 

today was a good ol' southern fish fry. apparently, i have friends who are quite talented at cooking...very yummy. caught the end of <I>The Thomas Crown Affair</I> ...anyone seen it? it seemed to be really interesting so i'm somewhat annoyed at the fact that i saw the end without getting into it. i shall have to watch that. i'm feeling a more movie/cook at home kinda week coming on; not to mention a trip to PA. i've been spending too much of my non-existant money as of late. and it's been fun, but other than being a guinea pig for the NIH i don't have much of an income at the moment so this could be a bad thing. 

*shrug* i don't have much useful to write at the moment. the night ended with some rather interesting conversations ranging from sex to drugs to racial equality to...i don't even know what else...for no apparent reason, i'm feeling generally withdrawn...something that has been creeping over me since wednesday. i should probably make an attempt to figure this out but for right now shall leave it be...

perhaps tomorrow shall bring exciting things like a not-quite impromtu motorcycle ride. that could be sweet..."

i got up at 6 this morning. i am *still* impressed with myself. especially since i was on the phone until 1:30a. well, whatever. updates in how jacquie has been spending her time: 

1. trying to keep from jumping the guy who worked for the marine mammal rescue program at baltimore. remind me again why i decided to stop going in that direction?! and otherwise rather enjoying the aquarium...ohhhh dolphins, i love you. 

2. i finally had tapas!! yum. and much more importantly had it with <lj user=""silverrwn"">!! rock on!

3. manipulative med conference thingie today at the NIH (sorry jordan...i was not receiving a sweedish massage, sadly, rather talking about them and the like). to be continued tomorrow. *note to self* good excuse for going sky diving: if you do so before a vaccination, it boosts your immune system. i swear, it's true. we also learned about the wild world of oxytocin. <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7042/abs/nature03701.html;jsessionid=43D87E25564F995E7EA6DAFDB1D83D17""> interesting...</a>

4. tomorrow is the...LAST PERFORMANCE EVER OF IRTAPELLA IN ITS CURRENT FORM!!!!!!!!!!!! i may cry. if you find yourself on <a href=""http://dtts.ors.od.nih.gov/visitor_access_map.htm"">NIH's campus around the Cloisters (building 60)</a> at 4p. tomorrow, swing on by!!

5. teaching myself guitar. yes, new goal for the summer. 

6. getting a parking ticket...that, at least, costs less than if i had parked in a garage. *sigh* 

7. getting stuck in the rain. i shall not walk with fred anywhere anymore. 

8. ignoring phone calls from 'sketchy k'. persistant bugger. 4 calls saturday, one yesterday, one today...gah. i plead drunk-enough-to-give-out-my-correct-number. i've now decided drunk dialing is much more acceptable. 

9. our not-quite-last rehearsal on tues. ended with some impromptu playing of guitar and harmonizing on some indigo girls songs...and then the beatles (not goth this time) and garth brooks...sooo fun. haven't done that in quite awhile. made me pull out my indigo girls CD and everything :) 

9.5 my ipod died. again. yeah, i know. don't start with me. i've been having trouble pulling together a smattering of CDs to sustain me outside of my apt. 

10. eating a peach while not wearing any clothes in my apartment because, well, i can. 

right. moving on..."

"event","it's been an interesting few days, and for my relaxing summer, a busy week is coming up...but busy in that good, varied fun randomness kind of way rather than working at the same thing over and over again. soon i really will get to the part of the summer where i get serious about practicing and reading, but for now i'm playing. 

friday was another 'hey! DC actually is a city with culture!' night as we went to see a friend of a friend's exhibit at the <a href=""http://www.warehousetheater.com/gallery.php"">Warehouse</a> over near Mt. Vernon Square. Quality artwork, OK beer, good company, introspective conversation. Good times. The night ended with an unintentional viewing of ""A Time to Kill""...or maybe that was the night before. Actually, time is all running together for me now so I don't particularly know. Saturday morning continued the happy DC-ness as we wandered around <a href=""http://www.easternmarket.net/"">Eastern Market</a> for hours, had a yummy crabcake sandwich lunch and played in a used bookstore for quite some time. I came home with hardcover copies of <U>The Bros. K</U>, <U>On Music</U> by Bernstein and <U>The Double Helix</U>. begrudgingly, I left this world to hit up <a href=""http://www.clubzone.com/c/Washington_DC/Nightclub/Home.html"">""Home""</a> (club in Chinatown) where a friend of a friend's was working and proceeded to attempt to carry on conversations with some rather uninteresting people. We moved on to the Hatter...which, yes. You know it's bad when I want to leave somewhere to go *to* the Hatter. I give the place credit as it is the only one I know of where within a couple hours I can pick up an army guy, guy who just got out of jail and a law student...and then walk home barefooted. 
Sunday morn brought more fun events...like dim sum! Which I finally had this morning with the lovely <lj user=""mpython""> :) then there was some productive big-sib planning at the only non-commercial coffee shop with internet access and comfy couches that i know of (sadly, I found out today that it also houses too many people from my past that I am uncomfortable around to make this a more permanant hang-out), and later a 3rd viewing of Episode III...but this time from the *other* side of the balcony. I think I'm an overall balcony convert. Once again, yay for Uptown theater! So after a rather unproductive Talula-off, it is bedtime..."

"event","listening to a Jacq September mix on my itunes...not stuff I've listened to in quite awhile. I like that listening to Matthew Sweet conjures memories of an impulsive trip to the beach to rendezvous with one of those friends who you speak to on rare occasions, but the familiarity and closeness come back within seconds of the initial hug 'hello'. I feel blessed to have quite a few such friends, but at the same time deeply saddened that they are in fact so far away. 

Last night was a super-fun DC night. Many thanks to <lj user= ""cohene""> for joining me on a shakily planned excursion :) I am currently filing away a mental note to hang out on 14th St a lot more this summer. Major props go to <a href=""http://www.hr57.org/pages/680590/index.htm"">HR-57</a> which is one of the few places in DC that doesn't hide behind an air of pretentiousness. I simply love it. For the tenor sax player who invited us in to hear some jazz as we approached the door, for the singer sitting to our right in her Howard University T-shirt and jeans, for the 'young cats' (high school kids) who you could almost perceptibly watch transforming on the stage from the carefully-calculated-solo/page reading musicians to feeding off of the eclectic energy of the audience/on-stage presence, for the bottle of Merlot and smells of southern food coming from behind the bar: it is a unique DC experience that I am just disappointed with myself for not finding earlier. And of course, no night which starts at the Ust metro can end without a trip to <a href= ""http://www.benschilibowl.com/"">Ben's Chili Bowl</a> which holds so much history and personally reminds me of a mix of cold fingers after a city clean-up day in college and late night concerts at the 9:30 club. 

Many of my friends from school have been complaining of boredom with having time off and nothing set to study. Watching my list of things to do this summer lengthen more and more every minute and having the opportunity to experience cultural activities in DC and travel and actually spend time with loved ones and play piano without the ever-looming task of studying...I simply cannot understand such boredom. Again, I wonder if I'm the type of person cut out for this school.

"event","(that was the darth vader theme, in case you couldn't tell)

so i completely have star wars on the brain. i'm going to need to do a marathon episode I - VI watching. there's something about taking some horrible dialog, mediocre acting, incredible special effects, blatantly obvious symbolism revolving around religious undertones a decent score and fun characters that makes for a good time. as i was discussing with my step-dad on the way back from good ol' tilghman 8 theater tonight, this is the only movie that can get away with such things and still maintain classic status. 

it's also amusing with the blatant symbolism and not so carefully hidden foreshadowing that some people still don't catch on. i mean, there's probably a lot i don't catch on to so i'm hardly one to criticize. at the same time, i couldn't help but giggle when the guy in front of me was all like 'wait, padme has twins? luke and leia...' i could see the light bulb turning on. dimly, but slowly turning on. also my friend who was surprised in episode III by the fact that anakin becomes darth vader. 

*covers mouth with hand* sorry if i just ruined the plot for any of you. move on. nothing to see here...doo-doo-doo...

well, ok. so anyone up for some star wars watching lemme know. perhaps even the star wars drinking game is in order...every time a good guy dresses in white and a bad guy in black...every time luke whines... yeah. i remember introducing a good friend to star wars that way freshman year. i don't know how much she got out of the movie, but i can say a good time was had by all..."

"event","my left shoulder hurts. i think i did some permanant damage, besides which, my friends' new, disgusting favorite pasttime is to peel the skin off of my shoulders/back. now i remember why i don't do the sunburn thing. i guess, regardless, one cannot sit out in the sun for 3+ hours with no coverage and expect to be exempt from UV rays. particularly between the hours of 9 - 12p. ahhh, whatever. in another week i will have grown new skin or something. i needed the peeling experience to make me greatful for my not-easily-burnt skin and to scare me into wearing sunscreen for the rest of the summer. 

in the meantime, today was rather productive, boasting some big sib database entry, snazzing up my resume, thinking about getting a job seriously for more than a minute, going to the gym, getting a haircut, moving my car every 2 hrs. from whatever on-street parking i could find, baking 2.5 dozen banana nut muffins, catching an episode of <I>dawson's creek</I> and <I>the cosby show</I>, going to a dinner party at maggie's to meet her sisters and riding around not-quite-aimlessly, trying to avoid drunken crazies around adams morgan/dupont on my way back and dropping off a couple of my girls. 

i'm psyched to go home tomorrow...puppy time and getting to spend time with my parents and grandparents should be good...i'm a little concerned mom will freak out about things (in no particular order): (1) my impending skin cancer from the looks of my shoulders/back (2) the state of my car...being quite filthy and with the remains of a 'final warning...' sticker on my driver's side window... (3) retrospective mothers day guilt (4) not staying home long enough guilt (5) my impending need for gynecologist and eye doctor appointments...ok, i may be totally off here. perhaps it will be a worry-free visit. we shall see. nonetheless, i can't wait to get home and give everyone a hug and just play with the puppy for a few days. perhaps jim and i will even go see star wars for some step-dad-daughter bonding time (which is rare). 

anyway, guess i should fall asleep with thoughts of what i'm going to throw in my car before leaving tomorrow. man, i hope traffic doesn't suck..."

"event","i hate creepy men. 

i have had 2 more run-ins with the garage attendant mentioned in a previous post. the most recent one features him stopping me in my car and telling me i can't park where he has told me to park (and where i have previously gotten notices on my car to park when i mistakenly have not). we argued back and forth about my being a resident, and he asked me where i live so many times that i finally told him i don't think i should need to divulge any more information about where i live; i have proven to be a resident by it saying so on the monthly tag i hang on my car and i have told him the building i live in 3 times. he said there was a car that looks like mine with michigian tags that parks on the lower level. what the hell does he want me to do about that? angrily he gave me my card back and let me leave. 
i've always been nice to the guy, and suddenly he turns on me...the other day he's asking me 'what are you doing over the summer?' seems an innocent enough question, no? i respond that i'm working *shrug* and he's like 'yeah? or do your parents pay for you?' and then gets all close to me and says something about how '...your family have money? do they pay for you to do nothing...?' and he was all jerky about the fact that i would politely say 'excuse me' or 'i'm sorry' when i couldn't understand what he was saying since he has a strong accent and mumbles half the time. he started snapping at me and raised his voice all mocking-like '<I>excuse me excuse me excuse me...</I> what. you can't understand me? huh?'

freakin' jerk. <lj-cut text=""creepy men rant"">

the sight of his face now makes me ill after numerous such encounters which over the past two months have ranged from his propositioning me to go wash my car in another garage with him after 9p. to yelling at me for not telling him when i'll be gone or where i live or not understanding what he's saying. 
i decided the mere fact that i had the taste of bile in my mouth as i walked towards the garage and was so upset i couldn't concentrate on the first half-hour of star wars and was worried intermittently throughout the movie about going back there...i have taken this all to be ridiculous and decided enough is enough. i parked my car behind my building with a note on (since it's all reserved parking) and am devoting the rest of the morning to searching for an affordable, close parking spot. with the resolve to park behind my building, my stomach finally stopped churning and i was able to relax. as dumb as it sounds, i just can't give this guy the pleasure of intimidating me anymore. i can't deal with feeling sick about a parking situation. 

in the meantime, there is another guy i used to respect who has turned creepy on me. WTF, dudes? if being nice means that you attract creepy guys, then i suppose i'm done. i hate that it comes to this, and i hate when you stand up to said creepy guys, they get all angry and aggressive (ie. parking guy yesterday) and accusatory...but AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! 

so if you're creepy leave me the fuck alone. don't ask me about my sex life or about where i live if you only speak to me on rare occasions. don't look at me expectantly; being nice doesn't mean you can have expectations of where that 'niceness' will take you. </lj-cut>

*continues seething for the next 10 minutes*

on the <I> other</I> hand, star wars was freakin' awesome!!! i love that i have seen the past few in the Uptown theater which is the rockingest theater to see big effect-typed movies in (we saw all of the Lord of the Rings movies there as well...) for those of you not in DC, it's this old theater with curtains covering the screen and it's just big and old and full of theatrical charm and for the first time i sat up in the balcony which was way fun. but the movie was so good...the making of darth vader was intense and the fight scenes were as always incredibly fun to watch. my one complaint is the weakness of anakin's supposed turning to the dark side...it was like he woke up one day and turned on the jedi. that could have been developed a bit more, but with lucas's propensity for dialogue (or lackthereof) it's probably best for us all that there were no more scenes with him speaking to Padme."

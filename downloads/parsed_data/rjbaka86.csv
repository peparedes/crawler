"event","EB sucks. I hate them so much. the people there are incompetent jackasses. Mike and i went there earlier today, (he wanted to buy final fantasy) so were in there for a good while, mike decides to get tony hawk underground instead, there is a huge ass line and some rowdy ass kids playing mario kart. the kid steps on my foot (i was wearing sandals). The stupid bitch that worked there was on her damn cell phone talking  about some bullshit, and were like waiting in line for like 10 mins. then this other idiot clerk comes up and is like, ""what do you want?"" mike says tony hawk. then the clerk says no, we dont have it, without even checking. he was trying to be funny. then he walks over and gets it, and does all this other bs like trying to be funny and shit but he was being an ass. finally i get pissed and im like, your a fucking moron and the whole store got quiet. then we walked out. pretty funny. but fo real, eb sucks. and what pisses me off is they didnt hire me when i applied, and for what, some fawking moron. man thats whack"

"event","Sometimes I feel as if I am fighting a losing battle. I think that I put myself in a lot of positions where I end up getting hurt because I put myself fully into everything that I do. Other people are not as willing or trusting as I am. Then, I end up getting screwed. Maybe I try too hard or something. I waste my time on too many relationships with people. I try to save things that just can't be there and it sucks. I'm really sick of trying to keep things going with friends that end up not even caring. I'm done. I know my recent messages have been fairly hostile. Sorry. I'm not really this hostile. The journal just takes the complaints."

"event","Why is that some people are so petty? When you aren't friends with a person anymore, you don't steal their earrings, CDs, assignment books, socks or toothbrush. You don't put up signs on your door to remind everyone of what a good person you are and how much the other person sucked. You don't roll your eyes at them and talk about them like they aren't there when they are and you certainly don't lie. You don't sit there and say one thing and do another. If you really don't care you just let it go. If you are fake and petty, or five years old, you do the things I have mentioned."

"event","You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise. 

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room. 

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise. 

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard. 

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise. 

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?
Out of the huts of history's shame - I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain - I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.

Leaving behind nights of terror and fear - I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear - I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise."

"event","Change...shit. I guess change is good for any of us. -Tupac

Why can't people understand that everyone changes. People become more annoying, get less annoying, get more fun, become un-fun. People get tired of the bullshit and others become part of it. People get happy and sad, and angry and lonely, and cranky and lazy. People become cynical and silly and maybe even go crazy. My point here is that people change, on whatever level. Their mood might change or their personality...it just happens. Everyone needs to just understand that and get over it, BECAUSE I'M GETTING PISSED OFF."

"event","I just had the best weekend of my life, no exaggerations. I really needed a weekend away, so when Kathleen called spur of the moment and said she was on her way, I was really excited. I never do anything like that. To add to the spontanaeity...Julia was like, ""I want to go!"" I was like, even fucking better. Mike got a $197.00 speeding ticket and spent an hour driving up and down Route 1. It was all good though because after that, we were finally on our way. We drank, we talked, we smoked, we sang at the top of our lungs. We ate, we got dressed, we changed outfits like 300 times, we cried and we laughed extremely hard. We met actually nice guys, guys that would do anything for their girl friends especially, and showed it. We skateboarded with Charlie and made a mess of Kathleen's room. Julia fell down the steps but was such a champ that she kept dancing anyway. We avoided Chris and the cops and basically stalked out Gary. I really feel that this weekend was such a success. It gave me something to grasp, something to hold onto, a way to enjoy college. The ride home when it was all over was so great. I didn't want the trip to end but when I was sitting in the backseat with the wind on my face and Julia, Kathleen's and Mike's smiling faces all around me, it was then I felt like nothing mattered. It was like I was seriously living it up, having an awesome time with my friends on a road trip, really enjoying being young. It was like a movie. I wish I could express how I felt better than this. Here's a line from the theme song of the weekend: ""Come fly with me angels, fly me away, I'm knocked over backwards and can't seem to be saved. All I know is I've fallen from what has been safe. I'm losing this ticket that I've never played...I don't wanna live one more day just getting by, gotta live for my life."""

"event","You want to know what is especially ridiculous? The fact that my laundry is spilling out of my hamper, and yet, there is no place to wash it. I mean seriously, what the hell is going on? There is a huge wash room in St. Katharine dorm here at LaSalle. So I went down the other day, kind of early in the morning. I opened up one washer and there was water in it. So I opened the next one. Water in that one too. THERE WAS WATER IN EVERY ONE...what the hell? Does no one here know how to wait until the end of a cycle to start their wash?? Did their mothers teach them nothing? I mean, there is a flipping sign that says,""MAKE SURE THE WASHER IS AT THE END OF THE CYCLE BEFORE YOU START A NEW ONE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, IT WILL STOP MID-CYCLE WITH WATER IN THE WASHER."" Are college students illiterate? So I scrounged some quarters to use the quarters washer, put my wash in, waited till it was done. Came back, threw it in the dryer. Came back to get my wash out and it was still sopping wet. Now by this time, I was so freaking pissed I was cursing my wash and thinking about how I wanted to throw it all away. Since the other 8 dryers have OUT OF ORDER signs on them, I lugged my heavy wash over to another dorm across the courtyard to use that one. Nothing open, so I had to come back, with the heavy wash in hand. Finally, I really said screw it and hung all my clothes all over my 8 by 8 cell I call home. I cannot, by any means be doing this every time I need wash. Thus, I still have a laundry basket overflowing with dirty clothes. UGH!"

"event","Things are so hectic. I stayed up until 1:30 last night trying to finish a paper. I know that's probably not a lot compared to what many of people do, in fact I know it's not, but it's hard for me. I hate writing papers about things I don't want to write about. Frankly, it sucks. And I only have to do it about 12 more times in the next 2 weeks. Wish me luck, please, I need it."

"event","Today has been one of those days where I have been bombarded with a million things that show me how old I really am. I found out that my friend from dance had her baby today: a little boy named Jaden. She is younger than I am and she has already started her family. Then another friend tells me she is getting married...soon. It's crazy. Then yet another friend was admitted to the hospital for rehab. I feel so old when people tell me things like this. I mean, just a few years ago, I couldn't even picture myself graduating high school and I'm in college now. I'm almost ""in my 20's."" My friends are having kids and getting married. I hope my life doesn't pass me by. It's a scary thing to think about."

"event","On a scale of 1 to 10, is it that serious that I want to be paid attention to sometimes? All I hear is that I am this crazy person that craves attention...so what? Don't I deserve some attention in my life? It is bad that I want Jason to call me once a day? Or Shawn to eat dinner with just me sometime? Or Jenn to hang out with me? Or my parents to listen to my feelings...and really hear them? I guess its bad to want to be the center of attention but I really think the ways in which I ""crave attention"" are not all that big a deal. But who knows, maybe I just can't see that I am selfish and crazy."

"event","Sometimes it upsets me that I live in Philadelphia but never take advantage of all the things there are to do here. Today I went into Old City and Chinatown for the first time since I have been down here. I saw multitudes of people, cobblestone roads, horses, gravestones and ducks hanging in windows. I saw the most beautiful mural of an American flag. It amazes me that someone has such extraordinary talent and patience to complete such a task. I am so un-patriotic and it's times like that I feel really guilty for it. Anyway, I wish I went into center city more often. There is so much to do and it's so much cleaner. It's way better than North Philly where all I hear are gunshots and screaming Becky's."

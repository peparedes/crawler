"event","<p>So I've had this account for I don't know how long, and I figured I should maybe post an entry - seeing as how that is,&nbsp; ya know, the point of having an account.&nbsp; I don't really do the whole journaling thing,&nbsp;(I find&nbsp;my life isn't interesting enough for it) and&nbsp;I'm also incapable of writing&nbsp;fan fiction, much to my despair, hence the complete lack of entries thus far.&nbsp; See&nbsp;the only reason I have one of these things at all is because of&nbsp;<a href=""http://kroki-refur.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://kroki-refur.livejournal.com/""><strong>kroki_refur</strong></a>,&nbsp;who insists on writing amazing fan fiction for my beloved Supernatural, and then <em>friend locking</em> some of it.&nbsp; After reading all her unlocked fiction, obviously the only course of action was to sign up for my own account so I could become her friend, and read the rest.&nbsp; So Refur, you don't know me at all, but this is all&nbsp;because of&nbsp;you.&nbsp; You're just that amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Well I'm off&nbsp;to&nbsp;attempt carrot grilling.<br /><br />&nbsp; </p>"

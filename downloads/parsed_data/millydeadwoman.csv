Got my first birthday present today 
Jeff Buckley cd..
I was dead made up :)
So i went all giddy and hiper in school 
But i suppose i'm always giddy
Probaly why it took me so long to realise that in actual fact i no longer have friends...
Sucks really
And tomorrows the last day 
But i'm not excited coz then i'll have to face it that i'll have to go out with ppl i don't really even talk to in school
Its all so sucky
Anyway i better shut up now
Byeexx"

I no like noone reads this shit
But i suppose its good to hope someone will and i can pour out my messed up little heart
I've lost friends who i shouldn't have
And made friends who i shouldn't have
And its all really messed up in my head right now
Like i'm back to square one
Except this time theres noone to escape to 
I'm alone
And thats probaly why i feel alone
See it probaly makes sense to you
But when you feel it 
Oh no it doesn't make any sense at all
Its not fair
And this is why i get so pissed off these days
So bloody pissed off
Noone to talk to either
Its all rather shit...

If only i could turn back time and erased that part from our memories then maybe i'd still love you..."

Till i came back
Then the rolling of eyes and the evil looks
The bitching
The thinking oh yer were the best started

And you no what it really gets you down
Badly
It hurts
The fact that they've pointed out you have no friends
And the fact that they've pointed out you look bad
And the fact that they're so much better than you
And i can't believe there not even the scalls
I understand all those points
And i get them
But why just shove them in my face every five seconds
Oh look helen your so small hahaha
Oh look helen your hairs so frizzy hahaha
Oh look helen 
Oh look helen

Aaaaa

Its been a weird day
Like i totally don't believe in god
But today i was flicking through channels and i stopped on one and it was talking about god
And the door started to shut 
It was weird
I must sound crazy
But it was totally freaky
I just sat there shitting myself
Cause no windows were open
And the handle must have moved or the door would't be able to shut
And no one else was in
I feel like going out of my room and hitting my parents
I hate them

Ok it may be friday the 13th but that doesn't mean it has to make me cry all day
Hmm what happened...
Well...
me and beau were saying to Elliott in german
that we don't like being left out and ignored
and beau was saying how he leaves her out in science 
and shes told me how she feels about this and so i backed her up Then he told me to stop being so nosy and that i was always being a moody cow
So i agreed and said if he wasn't so obbsessed with himself he would notice i'm upset about home and friends and stuff..
He turned around in a huff and then decieded to move
but as he was moving he picked up his chair and he sort of made it hit/threw our desk really loudly
and then i was like oh fuck off..And started crying because everythings built up..
And then he was like to everyone oh ignore the bitch she's being attention seeking and so i got ignored all day..
So i was upset all day really
And now no1 cares about me
And i don't fit in, in anyone's group..
I've lost my friends..

"event","Today has been better than yesterday so far..
Still not really feeling happy about my friends..
Elliott was in today..I did not get along with him..He was just bitching to me all day so i just flipped on him every second. 
I'm sitting here freezing too death..
I'm so pissed off..I don't know why though and i can't cheer up..
I just end up being all quiet around people untill i go hyper which last about half an hour and thats it for the rest of the day..Shit really..
I was going to watch another disney film tonight but my brothers hogged the tv with the video player to watch football...So i'm very angry..
I sort of had a tiff with jonny before aswell..And jonny's someone i usually get along with..
He was going on about he great violence is and well i just got pissed off..
Geez i'm being a moody bitch today..
Me and Beau had strawberries in german and mine was gee and beau's mikey but mine commited suicide out of the window..As well as all my work..And now my book has strawberry blood (juice) all over it..Ooopsies..
I need to go see a random band..

"event","Hello
My first entry and not a happy one either..
I'm sitting here attempting to write some sort of poem..
But nothings happening.
Listening to demolition lovers isn't the cleverist ways of cheering myself up..
Infact its just making me cry..
Oh the fun and joys..
My friends are all being big shits and really i hate them right now..
Except beau who atleast is not a shit thank god..
People are like talk to people..
What the fuck is that meant to mean..
Bah..
Don't have much to say..
I'm probaly getting my hair cut on saturday no idea what to have it like..

Grrr

Your humor's mostly innocent and off-the-cuff, but somehow there's something slightly menacing about you. Part of  your humor is making people a little uncomfortable, even if the things you say aren't themselves confrontational. You probably have a very dry delivery, or are seriously over-the-top.<br><br>Your type is the most  likely to appreciate a good insult and/or broken bone and/or very very fat person dancing.<br><br>

so the long awaited update is not going happen :-) so there 

been unmployed now for a full month, starting to run out of money I may have to find a new job but I'm not to keen about it, 

donna visted me first time I seen her in over a year and I got one days notice that she was flying in :-) she always had a flare for the dramatic, 

she broke up with one BF and is all ready with another, the prevously she was engaged to be married, and now she recons to be gay. she found some mags and heard some rumors, eh sounds about right I never liked the guy. I met him once he was a lot older that her and was dressed as a teenager,  I reconed he was just some old git trying to recapture his youth. ""your only as young as the woman you feal"" :-)

she hooked up with this new bloke with who is real RA head, who is a plays gutare in the pubs where she lives, when will that woman get some sence and stop bouncing form rebound to rebound. 

I'm suposed to vist her in her parents place in donegal but I realy don't know, If that is such a good Idea I have some very mixed feelings towards her."

"event","I'm starting to hate my new job 

it's not the work itself or the people, 

its that fact that I don't get a moments rest, I seam to be alway chasing some problem or dealing with an imagerancy, today I'm told to geta  machine ready for a demo that is going on tomorrow, I get the machine ready and setit up, then I'm told 2 hours before I go home that they need it set up to would with anouther peice of equipment, that no one in the job has set up before and someone has taken the install manuals,

when I started in the job this was cool
but ive been there a while I know that back gound story now. 

the decision is made normaly with out anny conconlation by one of the MD's, they take the manuals to read over them, since they want to sell this peice of equipment, they leave the manuls in their car.... office, and forget about the whole thing. one day before the demo they have a meeting, they then at this late stage remember their plan and dump it on my head to get it working. 

I like to think about problems and then act, 
I spent a long time, training my self to behave in that way.
althout this has become a charactor flaw, well there is the study of a situation, and then there is procrastination.
and when I get drunk, i digress to my impatient nature and realy fuck thing up. but any way I was on a rant

 two of my bosses expect imidate answers and for me be doing stuff at full whack all the time. I am growing very quickly tired of this behaviour, and I think it's time to be consider chalking this one up to experince, salvage a few old plans, orginse my retreat, and various other sayings"

"event","So I kinda settled in to my new job. It's in security(of a sort), well I fix PC's I was sold the job as something completely different. more networks, large data storage and documentation what the job actually entails is PC maintenance,  and Phone support for PC maintenance, saying the some aspects of the job are quite challenging, 

the PC maintenance  side of thing is very much refreshing, the whole hands on is very much up my street. I like it a lot, I know it's going to become boring after a while but for the time being I'm having fun. 
I also got to train people which was a bit never wrecking but good, OK I was only in the door (2 weeks) and when The said that I had training I naturally enough reckoned that It was I that being trained, but no I was dong the training, I had to wright up the course for a 4 hour class and then deliver the course with one days notice, OK so it wasn't that hard it was just PC maintenance (hardware) , basic use of portioning tools, how to install with Norton ghost :-) (yes yes you do put the disk in the drawer) and some debugging checks that can be done. 

My job is quite stress full compared to Eircom and I always end up very tired after it which is no good state to be in I don't know how long I can last like that and I thing I'm going quite mad being the I spend much time working by my self. And my bosses yes I have a few or I have one but they won't own up to it, preferring me to the lead by the multitude. One of the major good points is that I get respect something that I never felt when with Eircom. I suppose you only feel respect when you do something worth while and then get thanked for it. I was thanked in Eircom but I never felt the things that I had done were actualy worth while.

I kinda miss the social life of my old job, the my new company is quite formal in it approach and that does lend it self to a good social atmosphere. the fact is I burnt some bridges before leaving Eircom, I said some things that I reckoned needed to be said and now I'm not so sure (my methods where alcohol and mobile txting %-! ), now I just don't feel welcome to go out drinking with them any more. I do prefer a nice clean break, the kinda that forces you never to return (I'm a habitual backslider). Max that I would keep contact is one or two people."

"event","back on the internet. was off-line for like what seamed like for ever, 
my laptop is so so dead  
I had to setup my media station as a desktop. got an old CRT monitor which is now perched on top of it dwarfing the little mini-itx box, like some kinda computerised prey. 

I got a linksys WMP54Gv4 and a DVD+R RW, to help with the conversion.

the wifi card which will is natively linux compatable which will make it a hell of alot easier to set this box up on slack. but before I start messing about again I'm going to ghost it all, I now have all the applictaion s that I would normaly use, windeos services have been reduced to those that are actualy nessary. and all look good.

I'm planing to get a nice monitor, TFT 15"" wide screen with TV support. The prices on these have gone up in the last short while (well actually the avitablity of cheep ones has died off). I'm planing to wait a while may be a month or so before I purchase. 

need to get a new kb and mouse somting laptop like, but I've yet to find somting that appels. 

Oh the new computer is called rapture, 

orac is dead rapture lives."

"event","A few years ago, I spent sometime in the company of dreamers. I group of people who had addictions that ruled there lives, people how sought escape form the despair of their dull and dreary lives with the use of dream. 
They would use television drugs and greed to show them their dreams. 
They would collect the dreams so that when they meet they would discuss them and share they in a weird fanatical conversations. 
The would avoid conversations on other topics having very little to discuss.

I hear them talk of their dreams was so shame full in it's way, aspirations that were so beyond their capabilities. 
The wishes of our materialistic society the kind of considerations that only apply to the 1% of the population, that have over 50% of the wealth.  
The dreams were not fantastical, psychedelic or erotic but were specific material. 

They would sit about and discuss the things they would do when they would win the lotto, or when  what ever get rich quick seam that they were pondering over today. 
There is noting truly wrong in there actions, Indeed it is quite common to consider what one would do when the value of something is not measured in little pieces of paper anymore. 

The issue that gets me bloging is the way that they believed in it. 
That it was no longer just a simple dream that held a universal entertainment value but something that required constant contemplation. 
They shaped there lives so that attaining the dream it self was the  main focus and not attaining the thing with that the dream showed them. 
They organised their lives so there was noting left to distract them, giving up or losing their jobs, dropping out of collage, living in spartan accommodation, and disassociating them selves from people that did not follow their rituals.

Do people require beliefs? Do we all need in someway to be fanatical over something, be it music follow, a collector of some kind, football fan, a priest, avenger or drug addict.  What happens when a person stop seeking that obtainable goal. Do they become followers of dreams."

"event","It's not ironic it's just a series of unfortunate events

on Tuesday afternoon I had an Interview for software engineering job 
I was the first one I had in months and I was feeling quite optimistic about it

I had a half day at work so I left at 12'oc the interview was at 4 

I went home and started to prepare, I went ironed my shirt, had lunch and went and had a shower
to take my mind off the interview I deiced to check out windozzze update and get the latest Direct X for my laptop.

I installed driectx and rebooted my computer 
then disaster struck 
the OS failed to load .... (good old windoze update)

the MBR looked foobar'ed there was a whole load of F's on the screen
I of course panicked .... there really no other proper way of dealing with a crisis.

I got good old trusty boot disk and loaded in to dos 
did the old fdisk/mbr to resolve the issue 

but fdisk could not find the windows partition, of course I was still in full panic mode and had not realised at that stage the fatal error that I just made.

fdisk that is the MicroSoft one cannot find NTFS partitions
and I had a NTFS partition. 

I then dug about and found utill disk ... this had a very basic partition manager on it  
I ran this and it gave me all kinds of errors ... now if I had left enough alone at this stage I may have been able to recover ... but I made I not reading the full instructions ... repartitioned the HD .... bye bye OS.

Any way it was now 3.15 I had the interview at 4.00 with no direction or contact details 
and the mistaken knowledge that the place was called oak park tech ( it was called oak point) and  ... the only directions that I could remember were that they were some where off merion square... 

I tried  to call friends that I knew had access to computers that may have been able to help 
I got trough to my brother Paul who was on the way form the west (he was somewhere in the midlands at the time). he had his laptop and access to the Internet via a MMS card ( I think that is what you call those cards that use the mobile network)

he was trying to help me but then my phone died
I had a this stage circumnavigated merion square and checked up most of the side streets 
looking for at all the brass plaques on the all the doors. ( a brute search algorithm) 

been now 4oc and quite visibly sweaty( it was a hot day) I decided to go home 

for those who want to know 

OakPoint,
5 Lower Mount Street,
Dublin 2,
Ireland 


I had walked past it twice

they say that it is better to to fortunate than wise 

but in my case ether would have done :-)"

so went to see the guide..
bit of a mixed bag that one

I didn't like that way they changed trillian and her relationship with Arthur., the main problem for Arthur in the books any way is pride. That they were the only too humans left in the universe and she decides to go off with a two headed egotist. Instead of the sensible mister dent. which is one thing that all gees have to contend with at some stage, I know I have. well not the whole end of the world thing ... but the been dumped because you bored them  ..

I the book and TV there was no real sexual tension with her and A. Dent she was very intelligent and like looked down on him... and I suppose the the rest of the crew as well. she was the one that did all the calculations ... nowhere in the movie does it mention her advanced degrees in maths and astro physics which considering that it mentions what every one else is doing before the earth ends is a is a bit  odd.

It was also missing  the roller coaster feeling that the book gives. I realy liked the start with the dolphins, the guide itself was well done. I cannot fault the choice of actors this, I think role was well played, particularly . mos def as ford prefect and bill nightly as slartibartfast"

I finally got my passport ... and I promised my self I would use it before the year is out I have.

I have spend all my life in Ireland I never once left her shores, 
when I was younger I had such a will to travel, I traveled about Ireland being surprised by every turn of the road. I would dream of far off lands and even of leaving this land forever, but as I got older I never sought out an opportunity to leave. I suppose now was I was afraid to be disappointed dreams are powerful tings and sometimes I feel trapped by them, kinda like unrequited love or the construction of a project, you can be disappointed by the outcome if the prize is not all you expect and the mind it is not bound to the realities of this world.

so I have vowed to travel, to see a new horizon, the destination does not mater it will be the change the different aspect of human culture that I will be seeking. 

also : I'm starting my CCNA course on Saturday 850 ecu's I do hope it worth it. I really want to get out of support and this is not exactly the best route but, I find the prospect of learning in a structured environment will improve my disposition in finding new different employment."

I scan my laptop for spy ware and virus, none found 
I rebooted routher no effect
removed the firewall no effect
I ran the old fave netsh int ip reset all no effect
changed the wLan cards no effect

there was no flashing sig on the wLan  on the router so it doesn't look like a high jacker.

there is the possibly of HW failure in the router 
It maybe a someone with an Wlan card in the area with a hardware failure

I know that I get slow traffics and kicked form the Wlan when <lj user=""wyvernfriend""> connects to the network, I don't think it's that, since the problem persisted after she a had shut down her computer, but I do know that the distance factor will cause my wlan card to be more susceptible to other wLan cards interfering. 

the problem seems to have righted it self, but I am keeping a very close Eye on it.

"event","I was speaking to <a href=""http://turnipfish.blogspot.com/"">Turnipfish</a> he is of the opinion that he does not regrets any action in the past that he as taken, arguing that regret is a wasted emotion, the opinion was given loosely in a drunken moment, so this is not a criticism of his opinion but an examination of the subject that was seeded with his statement.
 
personally I do not believe that regret is such a bad thing, now people can dwell on it a bit to long and become obsessed with a past action, or become consumed with what could have been, but it is just as important to regret a mistake as it is to accept the action and get on with your life. If you do not regret you do not reflect on you actions, It is my opinion that to reflect
on your actions is no understand your self. 
 
Society is going trough a change over the last 10-20 years. the structures that we used to affirm out existence, family, community and religion are talking a back seat and have being transposed by newer structures business, friendships and what ever else we can think of, the problem of the newer structures is they leave no place for regret or reflection. 

The problem is two fold, firstly regret and reflection were/are primarily the domain of religion,  with in the last 50 years religion has found it self losing it grip on wester european society. Because regret (guilt) was such a main part  of the religious structure, it actively monopolised those emotions. When we started to change our belief structure to a more holistic or humanistic approach we have sought to detach out self's form the worship and ritual aspects of the older religions. With this we rid out selfs of the structures that allowed us to express our reflection or regret. The second aspect to this problem, is tied with one the replacements of religion and that is psychology. The shrink is our new confessor, but instead of where the old confessor would punish us, the shrink does not do this. They look at guild a something to be worked through, like a leg that needs mending or a antibiotic treatment. Not as it is a opportunity to become a finer person, instead to letting the individual experience the refection of self that normally come after a period of guilt. They encourage there client to get on with there lives, as if a point is reached were they have been give a bill of guilt free health. 

If we are now living in a period of history where we, do indeed change our society in some radical way. It is undoubtedly true that we could never succeed as a people without the ability to reflect on our actions. It is essential to enable any analysis at all. So I have not considered form a moment  that it is in danger of disappearing, but saying that a populace that lives in the total now of soap opera's, adverting fads and government sound bytes would be a lot easier to control."

"event","so eventful week 

I got dumped by the girl that I was kinda seeing after 2 weeks. 
I realy don't know how to react to the dumping, we were not realy involved, well it started after a drunken night, there was no extream attration to her from me, I found her nice and fun, but not sexy. so it was on my mind any way to end it. 
but she got there first ... I feal kinda hurt, but I know it's pride so I don't realy care but I do kinda. I have no Idea what to think. I suppose If I realy liked her, I would feal forlorn or angrey or If I dumped her I would feel guilty but I don't. I just feal a little messed up but I don't know how to emote it. It's kinda like brushing your teeth and then drinking orange juice that is the best way that I can describe it

My friend Donna, who I recenly visited in Donegal, I now buying a house with her new boyfriend in the hot islands to the south. she has been going out with him for about 2 months. I realy don't have to explain what I said to her, but she never listens. She can blind her self from logic. She starts off with a proposition and a good solution then the situation chnages the premiss becomes invaild but she continues on the same course. It will probeley work out for her, she can be lucky like that.  

Finaly I was working on my little computer. I needed to get a new copy of an OS. So I downloaded it in work and copyed to disk. I installed the copy of the OS ""IT was IN Spainish"" I can not read spainish, futher more to my suppise, you cannot simply change the Lang you need a diffrent Disk. :-)"

The family that is my brothers their wives and my sister share a recent (to my family) Christmas tradition, the Chris Kringle. This was brought about to reduce the amount of time spent having to shop for a present while, increasing the value of the present itself to something meaning full for adults. 

The max Quota on a present is 150 ecu 

Last year there was much confusion when it came to the presents. Such a large value gift you relay had to make sure you got the right something that person would value. This very Quickly  became  a sham, a few poorly chosen words and you could easily guess who had to purchase for whom, problem was anonymity.
This year we proposed a wish list, unfortunately only a 2 members of the pact filled out the wish list.
Namely the person the I have to present with a gift on the 25 was not one of them.

Now I have attempt  subtly , I require to find out what they want before the end of this week so I can purchase the present on line. 
I normally have two types of questions 
direct and demanding (where I will be revealed) or 
fumbled and confusing(where they will not know that I a talking about).

My  initial hope to use one of my parents as a confidential mediator's it has been to no avail. 

I am going to talk to that person in the morning and during the conversation I will mention the wish list  and hope fully it will get them to mention there choices .

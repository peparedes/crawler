-go to eckerd, pick up new compact
-eat oreo cookies
-play on internet
-watch tv
-sleep in sheets fresh out of warm dryer

So...what if I go for a car ride, then (shut up, Julie) pick up some ""necessary toiletries"" (and a compact on the side, of course), then come home and check my email (very important to always check 'email'), then get in bed (with my books, of course) and just happen to bump the remote control with my foot and turn on the tv.  oh.  and smoke a cigarette, then maybe take a brief nap (to rest my poor studying mind).

Would that be wrong of me???"

"event","I knew this pretty weather was too good to be true.  This weekend is supposed to rain and after that, we'll be back into the 50's again.  Fuck.  

I've decided to stay home for Spring break and not go to Vegas with my parents.  I have a lot of work to catch up on and I'll never get it done if I take almost a week's time off for vacation.  I keep telling myself this is the ""mature"" decision to make, but I'm afraid that I'll won't use my time as wisely as I should anyways and end up regretting not going and having a good time.  I don't know...I need some time to spend with my Schmavis, too and this extra little break would be just perfect.  So, not going is a combo of schoolwork and him - I'd like to think they are equally as important in my decision, however I can't seem to be as objective in deciding that as I'd like.  And now that I've found out the weather for the next week is going to suck on top of everything, I'm really wishing I could just take off and forget about Wilmington for a while.  Damnit, I thought I was comfortable with my decision...now I'm not so sure.

I'm supposed to go to a colliquim today.  Yay, oh the fun.  It's at three...I'm still in my sleeping clothes...yeah, you can see where that's going.  Plus Cohen will be there.  Even MORE fun.  So, does my having a ""virus"" prevent me from being anywhere in the vicinity of his germ-worried big hairy self?  Should I not go to this because I didn't go to class the other day because of the supposed 'virus'?  Or, does he realize that I lied and would be even more pissed if I didn't go to the colliquim.  Ah fuck, I don't know - I'm so sick of trying to figure out what other people are thinking sometimes that it drives me up a wall.  I'm just going to do whatever the spirit moves me to.

"event","Joe's really super pissed at Travis.  I just found out this morning.  Travis doesn't know.  Joe has yet to tell me the ""why's"" but I'm not sure I want to hear them anyways.  I don't want to hear him say anything against Travis.  Whether it would be truthful or not - don't really care - it doesn't matter to me.  I'm happy with our decision and I'll be damned if I let someone coerce me into rethinking that.  Joe's a good guy...he just has so much growing up to do in respect to owning up to things.  I don't know if their friendship is salvageable at this point, but I do need to speak with him tonight to get things straight between us.  But if he starts busting on Travis, I just don't know how I'll react.  I know I need to set those kinds of boundaries, but doing so without losing Joe as a friend is going to be one hell of a tricky situation.

Excuse my random order of thoughts today, but I'm going on that whole 24-hour-no-sleep shit.  I'm coming off a massive stimulant high and that, combined with no sleep, makes for one unhappy feeling in general :/  But, it was my own decision to stay over Travis' until midnight, knowing that I'd have a good 4 to 5 hours ahead of me with the article.  As they say, I 'made my bed...'  But damn, right now I wish I could sleep in it.  One more class.  Give the WAIS subtest, and I'm going home straight to bed.  No television, no food, no anything until I sleep.  That's the deal and I'm sticking to it."

<P><FONT size=2>So.&nbsp; In case you are totally clueless as to who it is...it's Schmavis!&nbsp; I've had my little - obvious - crush on that boy for months now.&nbsp; I wasn't absolutely sure he felt the same way and just kind of let it simmer for a while.&nbsp; But, I guess it was driving him batty and he finally came over last night to talk.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>He knocked on my window, which is right in the front of the apartment, and scared the shit out of me as usual.&nbsp; He's like, ""wanna smoke!?!?""&nbsp; Lol...um, sure I guess?&nbsp; He was all nervous and couldn't stay still while we just kind of randomly bullshitted on nothing for a while.&nbsp; Then finally he was like, ""ok, i can't stand this anymore.&nbsp; i came over here to tell you something and i'm really nervous and...ok...but i guess i'll just tell you know instead of talking about it..."" and rambled on forever in the way only Travis could do without someone wanting to smack the person over the head with something.&nbsp; Then he told me that he hasn't been able to sleep lately or pay attention in class and he's always nervous and it's because he has feelings for me.&nbsp; He said that everytime he sees Joe around trying to flirt with me it drives him crazy and that's why he hasn't been talking to him lately because he's so pissed off about the fact that Joe knows he likes me and so on...&nbsp; I was so friggin flattered...you had to be there - he was just TOO sweet.&nbsp; I told him that I was really happy that he said something and that I felt exactly the same way and had liked him for a while but didn't want to screw up anything with our friendship.&nbsp; So, both of us just stood out there on my steps in the rain feeling all dorky about everything but incredibly relieved.&nbsp; He took my hand before he left - I love this, he's SO afraid to even hug me or anything, not like other guys who think they have the ""rights"" to go after any part of your body that they please whenever they please- and just held it for a second or two before he turned away to go.&nbsp; Super, super sweet.</FONT></P>

"event","My mom tried REAL hard this morning to fuck up my good mood, but to no avail.  It sounds terrible, but I have the impression she's doing it on purpose.  She started busting on my sister (who's not there to defend herself of course) first - which she knows I can't stand - then she started with the not going to the doctor bullshit.  I guess she's got this thyroid thing that her normal doctor wants her to get checked out and she doesn't want to do it and blah blah blah.  She knows it pisses me off that she won't just go and do it for God's sakes and stop whining about it, so she just loves bringing it up and causing a fight over it.  I asked her about her diet and she obviously lied.  Lie, lie, lie...manipulate manipuluate.  

I don't want to pay attention to that shit anymore but I can't help it.  She's my mom and I love her, but she needs to fucking grow up sometimes and stop expecting me to be a parental figure and fix all of her issues.  I can't do it and I won't.  It's not my job...I can barely take care of myself most days.  Anyways, besides all of that I'm going to have a good day today.  I'm going to class, then starting on my work for tomorrow immediately so I can get some sleep in and make the best of tomorrow.  As soon as she figures out that I'm not paying attention to the bullshit, she'll start taking it out on me - bitching about things, ect.  That's fine, I'll take it.  I'd rather her be upfront about it, but I know how to play the ""game"" as well.  In order to win, you don't let it bother you.  So, I'm not going to pay attention to all the bullshit...I've got shit to do and my own life to manage."

"event","I would so love to post a long, involved entry right now because I'm feeling super talk-write-ish, but I just have to go to bed within the next 20 minutes.  I'll do my best given the ""time constraints"".  (Can you tell I've been doing a lot of school work lately?)

Things are going MUCH MUCH better than before last weekend.  I feel like I had a mini-vacation over the weekend and as if I'm ready to hit school work full-force again.  Unfortunately, I took some liberties with my study time and had to make up for things the past two days.  It's nothing I don't do on a daily basis anyways, so I'm not sure why I've been freaking out somewhat.  I think I'm getting back into my semi-annual moderately severe OCD stage, so that may be making things feel a little more exaggerated than normal.

I have been reading ALL of your posts, even if it has been in the middle of the night (morning, actually).  Last night I stayed up until 4am and then spent an extra half hour making sure all was well in LJ land...had to wake up at 6am for Cognitive.  (Tell me how much I rock).  However, I didn't comment because there was too much to say in too little time and I didn't want to slight anyone.  But rest assured I'm thinking of you all.

Joe and I spoke extensively this evening.  We had a long conversation that pretty much outlined our life histories and how we came to be who we are today...it was pretty damn deep and philosophical if you ask me, especially considering I just called him to talk for 10 minutes.  Ten minutes turned into a long time!  But I think he really could use the extra support right now (God knows I can always use it) and it served a positive purpose.  He and Travis don't seem to be talking as much and when considering the large step Joe is making to get treatment right now, he sure as hell could use someone around.  Travis needs to take care of Travis, as I often say.  That boy...Lol.  I won't even start.

No more drama...and if there is drama, I don't care and am too busy to even listen to it.  Today instead of spending my down time in between classes in the grad lounge, I walked over to the library to study in the ""Quiet Room"" where talking is 'prohibited'.  What an AWESOME idea - yes, and I'm getting off track.  Anyways, that kind of removed me from the environment that ususally is notorious for gibber gabber so to speak :)  However, it also caused a bit of a problem when I plain ole passed out on the couch for three hours when my intent was to go in there to study.  I woke up ten minutes before my class started (in another building) and barely made it there.  I was soooooooo tired...

Which reminds me.  I need to catch some Z's now.  More juicy tidbits on the life of psychogirl later :)"

"event","Just got back from the meeting...and a movie...with Schmavis.  We went to see ""Along Came Polly"".  Scary!  I'm very Polly-ish, says Travis.  I was thinking he was a bit Ruben-ish himself...lol.  Anyways, it went well.  I didn't feel completely myself knowing that he may have a thing for me and I...well, never know what the hell I'm doing.  Travis is the kind of person I've never been interested in.  He's honest, genuine, kind and wouldn't hurt a fly.  There's not a mean bone in that man's body.  Nothing manipulative, dangerous or anything.  I'm used to everything he's not.  I'm used to the kind of guy that dates girls for one reason and when he gets tired of that reason dumps them like yesterday's news.  Or even worse, pretends as if all of the very weird things about me doesn't bother him but then uses them against me when things go sour.  And on, and on...

Enough about that.  I'm trying not to overthink or expect anything.  

Very important:  If anyone wants to drop a hello or hi to miss reema, please comment in my journal by the end of this weekend.  Sunday night at the latest to be exact.  I would like to send everything out on Monday so it gets there...you know, before the poor girl actually LEAVES the place.  Anyways, that would be great.

Oh...I took an intelligence test today (WAIS) for my Assessment class.  Basically, it was just to experience what it was like to be a client as well as to observe the doc student who was administering it, and so we were supposed to screw up lots of answers to make things interesting.  Oh boy, did I EVER!  I told her that Cleopatra was a cat, that the reason people have to get a marriage license is so they can drive each other around, and that Catherine the Great was Martha Stewart's ancestor.  There was one task where you had four blocks and had to replicate a model that she had made and I told her that I couldn't do it unless she gave me another block.  Then I asked her if I could keep them when I was finished.  Bet she never had a client like me before :)

Anyways, a few more things to talk about but I'm getting sleepy so I'll end it here.  I'm glad the week is finished.  I wish I didn't have so much shit to do in the next two days - specifically with a stats program I don't know how to use - but at least I can sleep in, so screw it.  Cheers to noon awakenings :)"

"event","Last night I had it out with Alex.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  I told him how I knew he had been spreading shit around about Joe and I and that I thought this past weekend was totally uncalled for.  He didn't own up to the rumor - he really didn't have to anyways - and said that everything he had done was in Travis' best interest.  Travis?  How was it in Travis' best interest to tell him about our little indescretion?  Guess what.  TRAVIS needed to know because...drum role...it seems that he has had bit of a crush on me.  *Loss of words*  Yeah.  Well, I don't really know what to say about that.  I um...well, yeah.  I guess I'm speechless.  That's why Joe and Travis were on bad terms and why Alex told Joe about what happened.  Kristin told me that the reason Travis was all upset was because Joe kept the whole thing from him (pretty shitty on Joe's part, considering he IS Travis' good friend). Maybe it shouldn't have been such of a surprise.  Maybe I kind of already knew that...

I've always kept Travis on a pedistal above the rest of the guys in the program.  So much so, that I tended to shy away from flirting with him or thinking of him in that way.  I wouldn't put our friendship in jeopardy for anything.  But I'd be lying to myself if I didn't admit that I felt jealous and annoyed when I thought Alex was trying to set him up with some girl.  I kind of think of him as ""mine"" - not in a girlfriend kind of mushy way, just...well, I don't know how to put it.  This is all very odd.  I'm starting to think that I realized that there was something there a long time ago but never paid attention to it.  That is, I realised he had a bit of a crush as well as the fact that I liked him, but neither of those things seemed to affect my behavior.  Very weird.  Now, I have no choice.  It's definitely there and there's no getting around it...but I don't want it to seem that just because I know Travis has a thing for me that I'm going to go after him.  It seems like any guy I think might like me I'll go after, just to be liked.  Although, I think this might be much much different.  I could have gone after Travis a long time ago if that was the case, and I didn't.  I wonder why not?  Someone worth waiting for?

*sigh*

Don't I have work to do or something.  Where's my statistics book...maybe I'll do some practice problems just for good ole' times sake.

...or not."

"event","Today was rough.  I woke up wide awake at 5:30am - a half hour early - because I couldn't stop my mind from spinning.  First thing I thought about was him.  More specifically, that his little girl would be about 13 now and wondering if that made him nervous.

Went to my 8 o'clock and didn't really speak to anyone.  I just felt like I was too out of it to relate to people today.  I was in another completely different world from everyone else.  Joe didn't make any effort to talk to me after class.  I didn't really care enough to even wonder why.  Later I stopped by Chris' office and found out that he knew about what happened between Joe and I two weekends ago.  ""Wait,"" I thought.  That's not right.  And I'm placing my money on Alex as being the person who told him, too.  I figured that Alex might find out - his fuckbuddy was the one who caught us - but I didn't bank on his telling a bunch of other people.  This means that, in the past 3 days Alex has fucked with me twice.  He's getting a phone call tonight.  I'm going to rip him a new one.

The rest of the day just slipped by.  I usually stay at school after my classes to get work done, but today I just came home to this empty little apartment and slept.  Clover slept right next to me as usual and Molly at my feet.  There was just too much to deal with emotionally today and I backed out.  I just wasn't going to deal with it.  And I may not deal with any of it for as long as I can.  I'd rather sleep and daydream it all away."

"event","My mom has broken down twice in the past two days...possibly more than that.  I'm worried about her.  She won't go to see someone and there's very little that I can do for her.  I can barely keep myself sane.

Speaking of, I lost my mind today.  I went online and looked for Richard.  Things have been haunting me even more than usual lately. He's teaching at a highschool in Virginia.  I found many pictures of the kids (grades 8 through 12).  I feel like I need to do something, as if some poor girl could be going through the same hell as I did not all that long ago.  It makes me sick.

I also found a picture of him.  He looks like hell.  He was listed on some church's website to pray for because of 'chronic health concerns'.  All I could think of were the lyrics to this song...

Please don't bring me down
With that look on your face
<i>Because I almost didn't make it and one day
You might know how that feels</i>

I wonder if he knows how it feels.  I suppose I shouldn't care, but I do."

"event","What the FUCK.

Alex called me an hour ago and asked me where Travis was.  He said that he went out three hours earlier and that he was supposed to have come back for dinner, but hadn't.  He thought that maybe Travis may have been with me or gone for a walk at Wrightsville...Travis doesn't know his way around there yet because I haven't taken him yet.  So, I flip out figuring he may have relapsed, get in the car and drive up and down Wrightsville for a half an hour and slowing down as I get to bars because God knows where he could be.

I call Joe and find out that Travis is at his place watching the game.  He NEVER told Alex he'd be home for ""dinner"" nor that he'd be back anytime soon.  It seems as if Alex made all of this shit up in his head...We're not even sure that Alex even went out to look for Travis.  Joe seems to think the whole thing was a little joke - a little drama game that nearly gave me a heart attack thinking that one of my closest friends could be in very serious trouble.  I'd like to STRANGLE Alex.  He's ALWAYS pulling stunts like this.  Always asking, ""how's Travis doing?""  Like he GIVES a shit?

Well, if Alex really is out there looking for Travis he'll be looking for a long time because I'm not calling him back.  I told Joe and Travis not to tell Alex that I called them so Alex would continue thinking that I didn't know where Travis was and was out driving trying to find him.  FUCK him.  I hope he IS out there.

Later...

*Sigh*
I'm sick of this shit.  Goodnight."

"event","A quick update.  I've thought about the Reema letter a bit more clearly and I think it would be best if you left a comment in my journal with exactly what you wanted to write her just as <lj user=iredescence> has.  I will copy and paste what you write onto a document and make it pretty and such.  I'd really like to send it out by next weekend, so don't forget!  Oh!  And if you know anyone who is on her friends list that isn't on mine who you think would like to write something, please let them know about it :)  

Yay!  This is exciting.  You think she will like it???"

I miss Reema.  I hope she's doing ok.
I need to get off my ass and write her.  

I have an idea...how bout we all write a little something in our journals to write to her...a blurb or so...I'll put it all together and send I'll it out this week.  Sound like a good idea?  Or, you can leave it as a comment in my journal. 

Or...if you have any other kewl ideas, let me know.

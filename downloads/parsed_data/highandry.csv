heres the rundown. i brought eric to work, dropped off medical records, picked him up. had veggie burgers. {    }. shower. back to andover to pick up my bro, drop shaw off. 
then me carrie and sarah went to see finding nemo. now i was quite skeptical seeing this movie, but can i just say that i LOVED it. it was absolutely hilarious, and the characters were so cute. it made me realize how much i miss listening to AJ talk....ahhhh. after, sarah and i went to mi(a)ster wok for tofu. then came toys r us, sarah bought an ET, and i got a TURTLE, from the movie. AND we got CRAZY string .
then beach. and spraying people down with CRAZY string. funniest thing ever. a little nude bathing, and then we drove randomly. THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN:

we were at a stop light and next to us were two boys, who, according to carrie and sarah, were clearly baked. so,  obviously we had to spray them down. carrie covered their truck while they shrieked like little girls, ducking and screaming. HOLY SHIT. i almost peed. not actually, but close. 
well.
i think this is the longest entry ive ever posted.

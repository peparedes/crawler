"event","My overall opinion is that I liked it.  Not as much as the third movie, but pretty close.  So, the good, the bad, and the FRACKING AWESOME:

<lj-cut>
<B>Good</b>

- Dudley and his Nike gangsta street bling HAHAHAHAHAHA.  I'm glad they kept the ""Who's Cedric? Your boyfriend?"" line.

- The Order!  Punk-rock-prom-queen!Tonks and her hair!  Oh Tonks, I'm so sorry about that the sixth book did to you.  Mad-Eye and his staff!  KINGSLEY!

- Flying through London, especially the lit-up Parliament building. WOW.

- The transition between the bewildered Mr. Weasley and knowledgeable Harry in the London Underground to awed Harry and amused Mr. Weasley in the Ministry of Magic was subtle and well done.  The Ministry set itself was nothing short of spectacular, particularly the fireplaces.  

- Speaking of fireplaces, they've really gotten a lot better with the CG Floo stuff since the second movie.  That scene near the end, when Bellatrix escapes into the Floo, she really looks like she's melting into the green flame.  Good stuff.

- Using the <I>Daily Prophet</i> for transitions, the fade from sepia into colour and back to sepia was very well done, and made for some of the nicer transitions.

- Harry and Cho's budding relationship was actually quite sweet; I think it might have something to do with the fact that Katie Leung is a cutie-pie.  Their kiss was actually quite charming, despite lacking the hilarious awkwardness that I must admit I was waiting for.

<b>Bad</b>

- I wouldn't call this bad per se, but I was actually quite surprised at how toned-down Harry's anger was.  NOT THAT THIS IS A NEGATIVE THING, given that I was never a fan of CAPSLOCK NO ONE UNDERSTANDS MY EMO-WRATH!!!ELEVEN!!Harry, but particularly in Dumbledore's office after Sirius' death, I expected Harry to rage a little more.

- Some of the transitions were really weird.  There was one that went from Harry sleeping to him going on trial at the Ministry, and it took me a while to figure out that no, he wasn't dreaming.  And enough with the pan-outs, already!

- Snape's Worst Memory was too short, and you don't really get a good sense of why it was so incredibly humiliating, and why James and Sirius were such assholes as kids.  And young!James looks nothing like Harry, sorry.  They should have had Daniel play James if they really wanted the comparison.

- Like in the book, the final prophecy reveal was a bit of a letdown.  Especially considering what Lucius and Voldemort were willing to do to get to it, it didn't really tell them anything they didn't already know.

- On a purely aesthetic note, WTF is up with Tom Felton's hair?  If Lucius Malfoy can get a Paris Hilton wig, why can't his son?  Surely, Lucius isn't so petty as to hide his hair-care secrets from his darling only child!

- Why is it necessary for EVERY. SINGLE. MOVIE. to end with schmoop?  Granted, this one wasn't as bad as <i>Chamber of Secrets</i>, but the whole Harry-as-Moses leading his people into freedom thing was really annoying.

<b>THE AWESOME</B>

- Looney Lovegood!  She was marvelous, all white-blond wispy curls and big blue dreamy eyes.  The perfect balance between blissed-out crackhead and clever, serious young lady.  Why is Harry/Luna not canon?  They're so perfect together!  They can have beautiful curly-haired nutty kids!

- Dolores Umbridge.  HOLY <I>FUCK</I> she was awesome.  I wanted to claw her eyes out from the moment I saw her.  In the detention scene, when she said, ""you know you deserve to be punished,"" I wanted to STAB HER IN THE THROAT WITH THAT QUILL AND WATCH HER CHOKE ON HER OWN BLOOD.  And the kitten plates in her garishly pink office OMG.  Forget black, pink is truly the colour of utmost evil.

- DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY!!!! There are not enough superlatives in the world for how fantastic it was.  Cardigan-clad Harry, training students on using defensive spells and he's so patient and encouraging and grown-up and THIS IS WHY I WILL PROBABLY NEVER GET A BOYFRIEND, FOLKS! BECAUSE I'LL END UP COMPARING EVERY MAN I MEET TO HARRY POTTER.  And the Patronuses (Patroni? Patronii?) were gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous.

- NEVILLE!! YOU'RE SO TALL NOW!! AND YOU'RE STILL SO ADORABLE!! If not for the fact that my type of guy runs very specifically to glass-wearing men with light-coloured eyes and dark hair, I would be on you like white on rice, baby.

- FRED AND GEORGE!! Yes, the whole rebellion thing came out of nowhere, but WHEN IT HAPPENED IT WAS SO FRACKING AWESOME! And it was like, STAGES of awesome - just when you think it can't get any cooler, IT DID AND IT WAS WONDERFUL, I LOVE THOSE TWO TO THE DEPTHS OF MY BEING.

- BELLATRIX EFF-ING LESTRANGE BABY! I'm pretty sure she played the cat-lady/piano teacher/Ewan McGregor's mistress/childhood admirer in <i>Big Fish</i>.  In any case, she was awesome in her unfettered lunacy.  

- Harry and Sirius' bonding moments.  I really like how the movie downplayed Sirius' immaturity and general asshole-ness, because it just makes his death scene that much more devastating, oh Harry and Remus. *sob*

- The entire sequence from the prophecy room to Sirius' fall into the veil.  HOLY WANDWORK BATMAN!  I joked on my way out that I felt really sorry for the poor shmuck who would have to clean up the prophecy room the next day, but the whole duel, with the children running from black whisps of evil was amazing.

- This is an extension of the previous point, but I feel that it deserves love of its own: SIRIUS GROWLING ""GET AWAY FROM MY GODSON"" AND PUNCHING LUCIUS MALFOY IN THE FACE OH YES!  And those few moments when Harry and Sirius are fighting side by side were wonderful beyond words, and Sirius' throwaway line, ""Nice one, James!"" was sadder than Sirius' actual death scene.

- The duel was extremely well choreographed, particularly when viewed in comparison to the ""Dueling Club"" of <i>Chamber of Secrets.</i>  It's difficult to make waving a piece of wood look dangerous and exciting, but they certainly managed it this time.  I even liked the cheesy black vs. white smoke for the DEs versus the Order (and how hot was Remus when he appeared, wreathed in white light like an avenging angel).  

- Albus Dumbledore's utter PWNAGE, both in his ""I have no intention of going quietly at all (bitch)"" then DISAPPEARING INTO A BALL OF FLAME WITH FAWKES and in his duel against Voldemort.  I mean, we've heard for five books that Dumbledore used to be TEH AWESOME and that he was the one person who even Voldemort feared, but this is the first time that we get to see Albus Dumbledore kick magical ass.  I'm totally going to watch the movie again just to see that.  

- Finally, I've felt that, since the third movie, Daniel Radcliffe's acting has gotten significantly better.  As have Emma Watson and Rupert Grint - Emma especially, I think someone finally told her to tone down her eyebrow gymnastics.  But Daniel, there's been a scene in every movie, really, even the first two, when I really got a glimpse of <i>good acting</i>.  In the first movie, there was the Mirror of Erised scene; in the second, his little exchange with Aragog.  There was that glorious first successful Patronus in the third movie and Cedric's death in the fourth.  In this movie, the shining ""OMG DAN CAN ACT"" moment was when he was fighting Voldemort's possession.  Corny ""all you need is love"" stuff aside, it was superb acting work.  Absolutely cannot wait for movie six.

</lj-cut>

So, all in all, well worth the ticket price, and would definitely like to go watch it again.  Also, there is apparently a rumour going around that <b>Hugh Laurie</b>, yes, Hugh Laurie, is on the short list for Rufus Scrimgeour.  I personally think it is just a rumour, but if it does happen, I will be a very, very happy fan."

Today I had a rather delightful lunch with Wendy, during which time we realized that after four years of UofT, we have COMPLETELY LOST THE ABILITY TO MAKE SMALL TALK WITHOUT INVOLVING SOCIOLOGICAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES.  To further cement our inexcusable nerdness, we had each brought our lecture notes with us, and spent most of the time that we were not eating, studying for midterms. *facepalms*

<i>TV</i>

<i>Grey's Anatomy</i> continues to alternately make me roll my eyes and go ""wow.""  Because, season finale? Totally wow (IZZIE! IN THAT DRESS! IN ALEX'S ARMS!).  But these more recent episodes, not quite so much wow.

I'm also really starting to get sick of the DeeApolloStarbuckSam love square on <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>.  Dee totally needs to dump Apollo's ass, Apollo needs to get over his man-pain, Starbuck needs to get over herself, and Sam needs to divorce Kara and marry me.

<i>Farscape</i> is the best sci-fi show ever.  The powers that be must have been on crack when they cancelled it after four seasons.  Aeryn Sun is so my TV girlfriend.

I am becoming quite fond of <i>Supernatural</i>, but only because I'll watch anything that has Jensen Ackles is in it.  It says something about my focus that after having watched over half of the first season, I still don't really know what's going on.

Last but not least, <i>Heroes</i> is an incredible show, and everyone should watch it.  So say we all.

In this term alone, I read 3 books that I loved and that touched me deeply.  Yesterday was the most beautiful day we've had in months.  Today, it's raining, and the ground smells fresh and alive.

"event","I watched it on Saturday, with Wendy.  We caught the last showing of the evening, since all the previous ones were sold out.  There were a lot of small children in the theatre with us (and by ""small"" I mean like, 6-7 years old), about whom I was a bit worried, because GOF was SCARY.  Seriously, watch the first two movies, and then watch this one.  The difference in tone is incredible.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for those of you who weren't crazy enough to brave the pre-teen fangirl crowd and watch the movie on the opening weekend"">


<b>Music:</b>

Points for not overpowering the movie itself *coughWilliamscough*, loses points for the making the opening like a cheesy B horror movie.

<B>Flow/pacing:</b>

I wasn't as impressed with the flow of the story as I was after the third movie, but I didn't find it as annoyingly choppy as the first two.  They did cut out a LOT, almost to the point where, if you didn't read the book, you wouldn't understand the significance of some of the scenes.  That said, what did get cut was, for the most part, well-chosen, and they cut it out entirely instead of just briefly touching on it, which I appreciated.  I think a bigger problem, in terms of pacing, was that the movie felt very, very rushed, and I really didn't have much time to appreciate the cool stuff that was going on.  

And the dragon scene was ridiculously and unnecessarily long.  In a movie where they're cutting out half the plot, having a scene like that is just bad directing.

<b>Acting:</b>

I think this is the first movie in which all the kids actually ACTED LIKE KIDS.  Before, there was always this element of artificiality, as if they were actually adults pretending to be children.  

The kids are all so much better than they were in the first movie.  Dan in particular.  The scene where Harry brings back Cedric's body and refuses to let go of it made me hurt.  Rupert got to be more than just comic relief!  And he did it well!  Hopefully, this will convince future directors to give Rupert something other than make funny faces to do on screen.  Emma still sucks.  I'm sorry.  She is getting better though; she has *moments*, but she still overacts. like. crazy.  

The Twins are the very definition of fantastic.  I want to marry them.  Don't care which one.  Both, if possible.  Neville is a darling, and I love that his Yule Ball night was more successful than Harry's or Ron's. *pets Neville*  I liked the secondary characters in general; the first three movies tended to be very Trio-centric.

Gambon's Dumbledore was startingly unconvincing. I was shocked at the way he shook Harry and YELLED at him after the Goblet; I would NEVER expect Dumbledore to do that.  His anxiety also surprised me, because a big part of Dumbledore's personality is his supreme yet casual confidence.  Although this graver, less certain Dumbledore does fit in better with the Dumbledore from book 6.

<b>The Newbies:</b>

Cedric - HOT.  Also surprisingly delicate-looking, not what I'd expected him to look like, being a Hufflepuff and all (yes, I admit to... um, House-ism?  Is that a word?  I'll just stick to stereotyping).  

Fleur - NOT hot.  But the Veela thing was cut out, so I didn't mind.  She was still pretty, in a tomboy-ish Claire Danes kind of way.  Her complete incompetence was irritating, if only because it implies that the REST of her school is even more useless than she is.

Krum - Quintessential dumb jock.  Who looked like he was THIRTY.  Seriously, in the Yule Ball scene, he looked like he was Hermione's Bulgarian uncle.  And aren't Seeker supposed to be ""light and speedy""?

Karkaroff - looked like Vlad the Impaler.  Or Rasputin.  And don't they have spells to fix teeth?

Moody - absolutely perfect.  The Unforgiveables lesson was incredible.

Cho Chang - very pretty, didn't have much to do, and was another attraction that pretty much came out of nowhere.  

Rita Skeeter - not a bug, but still awesome.  And she perved on Harry, which made me chuckle.

Barty Jr. - disturbingly sexy.  He could be the Death Eater poster boy.

<b>The Relationships (romantic or otherwise):</b>

Hermione/Ron: would have been more effective if it didn't look like it was being completely overshadowed by the Harry/Hermione.  Also, immature jealousy and married-couple bickering do NOT chemistry make!  In fact, the way Hermione bossed Ron about reminded me uncomfortably of Mrs. Weasley, which brings up all kinds of Freudian implications that are very much ewwwww.

Krum/Hermione: see above, about Krum being Hermione's Bulgarian uncle.  I wonder how old the actor is, because he looks OLD.  And WHERE was the development for their attraction?

Harry/Ron: was surprisingly subtle.  The Feud had actual FORESHADOWING, and a realistically teenaged-boy reconciliation scene.

Harry/Cedric: a lot more antagonistic than in the book.  And I swear it looked for a second like Cedric was propositioning Harry when he told him about the Prefect's Bathroom.

<B>Special Effects:</b>

First and foremost, OMG WORLD CUP STADIUM OMGHOLYSHIT*ORGASMS*!!!! The Quidditch stadium had, by far, the most impressive special effects shots I have EVER seen in a Harry Potter movie.  As hokey as it sounds, I really FELT like I was THERE.

The Portkey was weirdly inconsistent.  In the World Cup scene, they sort of spiraled up into the air, but when Harry picked up the Triwizard Cup in the graveyard, he just vanished.

The dragons looked like dragons.  Compare the dragon to the Basilisk in CoS, and you'll see what I mean.  They looked almost real.

THE PENSIEVE!!!!!!! *lovessomuch*

The <i>Priori Incantatum</i> was absolutely beautiful, just the way I'd imagined it.  Pity there was no explanation for WHY it happened, though. *grumbles*

<b>The Ending:</b>

Was still cheesy, because it's part of the grand Harry Potter tradition, don't ya know, to end a movie badly.  This one was somewhat less horrifically bad than CoS and PoA, so... no complaints, I guess.

<b>Other Random Stuff:</b>

There was a lot of people-in-trees going on.. okay, not a lot, only 2, but they were both weird.  Cedric jumps down from a tree at the Portkey, and Draco is sitting in a tree in the ferret scene.  Why were they in a tree in the first place?

The cute little arm-link thing the twins did when they drank the Aging Potion.  I thought only newlyweds were supposed to do that?

Has Ron always been such a fanboy?  Because I don't think he's ever looked at Hermione the way he looked at Krum during the Durmstrang entrance.

Cedric lying with his head on another boy's lap when Harry comes to tell him about the dragons.  (Cedric has groupies. Hee!)

Was there anything in the book preventing Harry from just summoning the golden egg?  

The Weird Sisters. *DIES*

DID MME MAXIME ACTUALLY EAT BUGS OFF OF HAGRID'S BEARD?!

Daniel Radcliffe is WHITE.  Like, completely lacking in pigment.  Also, I adore Harry, but I truly have no desire to see him naked.  Please make him put his clothes back on.

Harry HESITATES before going back for Cedric in the maze.  Not canon, but still FABULOUS, because you just know that Harry is going to agonize about that moment for the rest of his LIFE.  Fabulous.

</lj-cut>

Non-spoilery thoughts: 

Overall, it was good, though not as good as PoA.  The one thing that really sold me was the way they handled the humour.  There were a few scenes in which there were drastic mood shifts between funny and dead serious, and they were very well-done.  Also, watching the movie made me want to rush home and re-read the book, so I think they done good with it. 

So, yeah.  WATCH THE MOVIE."

Apparently, some abysmally moronic idiot had been making popcorn in the basement kitchen AT 4:30! IN THE MORNING! and somehow CAUGHT IT ON FIRE.

"event","Or why Joss Whedon does not own my soul...

First of all, <i>Firefly</i> is a seriously entertaining show.  I don't have any idea why it was canceled so quickly, because it really is a hell of a lot of fun, and let's face it, there are many, MANY worse shows on TV.  However, once you strip away the shiny prettiness, and the snark, and the banter, there really isn't a lot of substance.  It's <i>amusing</i>, but that's about it.  I think part of this is because there simply wasn't enough time to really work in decent character stuff, or even a decent plot.  It's also due to the fact that Joss Whedon really likes writing dialogue -- and he writes fantastic dialogue, but he tends to skimp on everything else.  There's sloppiness in <i>Firefly</i>, well-hidden sloppiness, masked by layers of great fun, but it's still there.  It's a good show, but it's not <i>brilliant.</i>

Of course, none of this is going to keep me from watching <i>Serenity</i> at least twice in theatres, and I'm still getting the DVD the day it comes out."

"event","Quick initial thoughts on HBP:

<lj-cut text=""The Good"">

<ul>
<li>Harry. <i>HARRY.</i>  I don't agree with those who claim that HBP!Harry ""reverted"" back to the way he was before OotP.  This Harry, speech patterns aside, is most assuredly <i>not</i> the Harry in the first four books -- he's much stronger, much more of a leader (which is something that began in OotP, so yay continuity!), and he's not nearly as naive.  For pretty much the first time in the series, he actually <i>questions</i> Dumbledore, <i>disagrees</i> with him.  Also, Harry has groupies. Hee!

<li>Draco, vers. 2.0 (now with Personality!)  I think HBP is to Draco what OotP was to Harry: a hard smack of reality right across the face.  Draco, who obviously thought that the Death Eater world was the coolest thing ever, actually enters it and ends up biting off far, far more than he can chew.  I think we all kind of expected that of him, because let's face it: Draco's a nasty little brat, but he's not <i>evil.</i>  

<li>Slughorn, because the HP world really is primarily composed of character archetypes, and it is rare to come across a character, especially a secondary character, who's so layered and so <i>realistic.</i>  The more I read about him, the more I feel like I've met this man before, in real life.  And oh man, that scene when Harry manages to coax the real memory out of him... *whistles*

<li>Narcissa.  Who is totally fanon!Narcissa, I know, but I want at least one of Draco's parents to really, really love him.  Also, I like that she pretty much abandoned all pride (remember the stuck-up, snooty woman Harry saw in GoF?) to convince Snape to help her son.

<li>Ron/Lavender, Hermione/Quidditch Dude.  JKR isn't terribly good at writing serious romance, but she does romantic comedy quite well.

<li>The flashbacks.  I LOVE BACKSTORY.  I love seeing where characters come from, how and why they have become who they are today.  BACKSTORY IS MY KING.

<li>The entirety of the ending, although I felt JKR overdid the aftermath of Dumbledore's death.  It seemed as though she was trying to compensate for the lack of closure regarding Sirius' death by really hammering it in that Dumbledore. Is. Dead.  Well, We. Get. It.  Still, aside from that, the ending broke my heart and stomped on the pieces.

<li>Snape.  Actually, the ambiguity surrounding Snape, which I LOVE, because Rowling rarely gives us ambiguity; person A is revealed to be either good, or evil.  I love being able to actually <i>wonder</i> and theorize.

<li>Bill/Fleur.  Cutest. Thing. Ever.
</ul>
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""The Not Quite so Good"">

<ul>
<li>Harry/Ginny.  I don't have a problem with the pairing; I think it's quite sweet, actually; Harry gets to stay close to the Weasleys, and Ginny gets her Prince Charming.  I do, however, have a problem with shy, awkward Ginny suddenly turning into the Lana Lang of Hogwarts.  It feels dreadfully heavy handed, as though JKR is banging us over the head with ""look how pretty/popular/smart/sporty/perfect Ginny is!  Now love her!""  I hope JKR isn't intending for Ginny to be Lily Evans vers 2.0.

<li>Hermione Granger.  Was it really necessary for Hermione to have acted like that? Granted, sixteen years old and jealous, but I expected better from her.  

<li>Remus/Tonks.  Not because I don't like the pairing, per se, but because I would have liked some indication that something was going on between them, as opposed to just springing it on us like some Elizabethan novel, where everyone pairs off in the end.  Also, I didn't like seeing a cool, strong woman like Tonks turn into a mousy little thing pining away with unrequited love.

<li>The Harry-discovers-Draco-crying-in-the-bathroom scene, which I swear I've read at least a dozen times before in fanfiction.  This is not JKR's failing; it's just that there is so much HP fanfiction out there, pretty much every possible scenario has already been covered.  The Moaning Myrtle bit was a nice detail, though.

<li>The Half-Blood Prince.  Although it's not as cringe-worthy as I'd thought it would be, there's still something about ""half-blood Prince"" that reminds me of bad fanfic.

<li>The new magics: Horcruxes -- okay, what?  How long has Dumbledore been looking for them, and why are we only hearing about this NOW?  Personally, I'm not sure that introducing a plot device as significant as the Horcruxes in the SECOND LAST BOOK is a terribly good idea.  Also, unspoken spells -- have they ever been used in the series before?  Because that seemed very new to me.

When the US gets hit by a terrorist attack, the entire nation grinds to a halt as its people flap about in panicked horror.  When the UK gets hit by a terrorist attack, the... shopkeepers bring out tea*.  Granted, Brits have also been through a hell of a lot more**, but still, it makes one feel humbled... maybe even a little embarrassed.

You're a bit cold? Tea. Your boyfriend has just left you? Tea. You've just been told you've got cancer? Tea. Coordinated terrorist attack on the transport network bringing the city to a grinding halt? TEA DAMMIT! And if it's really serious, they may bring out the coffee.

"event","In all honesty, that movie had me from the opening song, ""So Long and Thanks For All the Fish.""  While I wouldn't say that I watched that movie <i>just</i> to hear the song, it's not really all that far from the truth.  I'm a fan, what can I say?

In all seriousness, though, like most movies that are based on books, the movie was definitely inferior to the book -- it wasn't nearly as witty, or as detailed, and I really, really missed the all-British cast of the BBC series. 

Speaking of the cast, the man who played Arthur Dent was amazing.  I loved the pudginess and the bad teeth and his bathroom, and his complete inability to get a good cup of tea.  He also got the best lines, which he delivered with a dryness that I found very charming. (<i>caveat</i>: the above may very well be biased, as I have a huge thing for British mannerisms)  

The actor playing Ford Prefect impressed me somewhat less, because I do miss the English Ford (who had incredibly blue eyes as well, *sigh*), and for some reason, this Ford was just... not as funny.  He didn't work the importance of the Towel the way I'd hoped.  

Zaphod Beeblebrox was played to absolute perfection.  I was both incredibly, overwhelmingly frustrated by his arrogance and sheer, complete <i>idiocy</i>, but at the same time, reluctantly charmed by his devil-may-care attitude.  Which, of course, is exactly how the audience is supposed to react to Zaphod.  Both he and Ford appear to share a total lack of awareness of personal space with everyone around them, which I found amusing.

Trisha/Trillian bugged the <i>hell</i> out of me.  The actress reminded me of Mary-Louise Parker in <i>Angels in America</i>, whiny and irritating and so not acting like a woman who degrees in both mathematics and astrophysics (if I remember correctly).  One good thing about her?  She had very pretty eyes.

And last but not least, Marvin.  <I>Marvin!</i>  Alan Rickman plays disgruntled characters so beautifully, and just...the sheer cuteness of Alan Rickman's voice coming out of a waddling, rotund manic-depressive (which I think is wrong, since the robot never showed any sign of mania; I think it was just plain <i>depressed</i>) robot delighted me to no end.  The movie is worth seeing for Marvin alone.

The movie was adequately true to the book, which I appreciated, and there weren't so many in-jokes that people who haven't read the book would feel left out.  The 42 joke was much funnier in the book, but the movie version of the Improbability Drive totally won out over the book version.  The special effects were terrific, as was the voice of the Guide (who was also the narrator).

Oh, and I loved the little shout-out to <i>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.</i>

Overall, I think the movie captured very well the sheer <i>insanity</i> of Douglas Adams' writing.  Because the plot of <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide</i> really does make no sense, but that's what makes it charming -- eventually, you stop thinking and enjoy the ride, and just nod and smile when the two main characters turn into sofas."

Ron's Beatles-inspired hair!  The merpeople, who look really scary.  Fleur isn't as pretty as I'd imagined (or as French-looking, for that matter), but Cedric is adequately good-looking and even Krum is kinda hot in a dour, vampiric kind of way. That one comes out Nov. 18. *marks in calendar*

<b>Movies I Intend to Watch Before I Leave for Vermont:</b>

<i>Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>: Either tomorrow or on Sunday.  Only because I want to see if they incorporate the ""So long and thanks for the fish"" song, which is awesome.

<i>Kingdom of Heaven</i>, because, okay, all mockery aside, Orlando Bloom <i>is</i> kinda hot.  I admit it.

<b>Movies I Have Just Watched:</b>

<i>Phantom of the Opera</i>: What was all that dissing of Gerald Butler's voice about?  Sure, he's not Pavarotti, but he's NOT BAD, considering he's an <b>actor</b> without a lifetime of formal training.  And he looks very good in a poet's shirt (/shallow moment).  The actress playing Christine was very pretty in a sweet, virginal kind of way (exactly the way I'd imagined), and she had a very pure, light voice that was a delightful (and evidently intentional) contrast to the rich vibrato of La Carlotta (also, Minnie Driver can sing! Wow).  I also didn't hate her the way I did in the book for going off with Raoul.  As for Raoul's actor, I actually did liked him, until I realized that I had seen in before in <I>Angels in America,</i> in which he played a conflicted and closeted Mormon, and then I just couldn't stop snickering.  His voice wasn't too bad, when he sang quietly; his <i>forte</i> was laughably bad, as was his hair.  Overall, though, very good.

<i>Stargate</i>: I've been obsessed with the show for the past couple of months, and it was definitely good to see the movie.  The movie was epic, with grand, sweeping camera angles and swelling orchestral music.  The first half of the movie was better than the second, though, and I swear, even after three viewings, I <i>still</i> can't find where they say the name of the planet they travel to.  Kurt Russell's jutting jaw is a thing to behold, and James Spader plays the oblivious geek very well."

"event","It occurs to me now -- well, that's not true, it occurred to me a long time ago, but the severity of it hasn't dawned on me until now -- that going to U of T was a very, very bad decision on my part. Because based on the marks I'm getting this term, law school is almost (and I insist upon saying ""almost"" because I refuse to give up hope just yet) completely out of my reach.  And unless I can somehow salvage things in my last two years of study, I will, most decidedly, be screwed.

I'm beginning to realize that I really haven't thought things through as thoroughly as I should have, and given how late this realization has come in my academic career, this is most worrisome.

As it stands, I really have 4 options:

1. Work my ass off and hope for a miracle.

2. Cut my losses and return to science.

3. Become a teacher.

4. Think of something else.

Okay, maybe it's more like 3.5 options.  Personally, I'm fond of the first one (particularly the latter part of the first one *looks meaningfully at heavens*), though the third option wouldn't be so bad; it would certainly make my inner despotic dictator happy."

"event","First and foremost, a very, very, totally unforgiveably belated birthday to Maryam.  I'm tempted to say something like, ""now you can drink <i>outside</i> of Quebec!"" but you've probably already heard that from everyone else, so I'll just wish you all the best.  I'm sure you're taking turning 19 a lot better than I did on my 19th birthday, which consisted mainly of me thanking people for their kind wishes while internally freaking out about the fact that next year, I'll be turning <B>TWENTY.</B>

<lj-cut text=""My 10 Favourite Childhood Authors"">

1. Frances Hodgson Burnett (A Little Princess) -- Sara Crewe was my first childhood literary hero.  I've never quite understood why I wasn't bothered by near Mary Sue-level flawlessness of her personality, particularly when I'm the kind of person who prefers characters with a bit of a dark side.  Sara, I think, is a prime example of a Mary Sue done <i>well,</i> for which I heartily applaud Burnett, because I've never since read about a character so inherently good and kind and smart and <i>interesting</i> without me wanting to shove rip him/her down a set of very tall stairs.

2. Roald Dahl (Mathilda) -- I like the character Mathilda for the same reason why I like Harry Potter: it's the whole ""up yours, stupid grown-ups"" thing they've both got going on.  There's also the fact that when I read it, I was in <i>my</i> rebellious pre-teen ""up yours, stupid grown-ups"" stage, so the concept of a telekinetic <i>wunderkind</i> who gets to torment adults appealed to me immediately.  I think I appreciate Dahl's work quite a bit more when I read it now that I'm old enough to see just how disturbing some of his novels are.

3. Louisa May Alcott (Little Women) -- A childhood favourite.  I wanted Marmee to be my mom, I wanted Jo to be my best friend, I adored Beth, I couldn't stand Meg, and Amy reminded me so, so much of Jenny (even down to the obsession with her nose!).  Oh, and Laurie and Jo totally belong together, and I ignore everyone who tells me differently (and no, I don't read up to the end of <i>Little Women,</i> I'm very happy in denial, thanksverymuch).

4. L.M. Montgomery (Anne series, Jane of Lantern Hill, Avonlea) -- One thing about Montgomery that always impressed me was her ability to recycle the personalities of her heroines without my consciously noticing it.  Contrast that to, say, Jane Austen, who did not possess that talent.  And Matthew Cuthbert is the sweetest, kindest, most wonderful character to ever grace literature.  I cried for hours when Matthew Cuthbert died, and was depressed for a week afterward.

5. C.S. Lewis (Chronicles of Narnia) -- In my defence, I was very young when I first read it and didn't get the Christian symbolism (which seems really blatant in hindsight) until much, much later.  And even then, I found Aslan a bit inconsistent -- especially after he forbade Lucy from coming back to Narnia, even though she was <i>younger</i> than Eustace, and what the hell was with that ""you are too old, children"" thing anyway?  *grumbles*  Still, Narnia was one of the first books I read that really came alive in my mind.  I could close my eyes and <i>see</i> Lantern Hill.  

6. J.K. Rowling (Harry Potter) -- I don't care what anyone says about the declining quality of Rowling's writing, and her inflating ego (both of which I totally agree with).  The woman gave us Gred and Forge, Quidditch, and Tom Riddle, and for that, I can forgive anything.  

7. Ann M. Martin (Babysitters Club) -- I know, I know.  Still, I always thought Martin wrote really good POV; her characters all had very distinct voices.  Granted, the fact that she used archetypes helped, but still. And the different handwriting, that I loved.

8. Phillip Pullman (The Golden Compass) -- In hindsight, I'm wondering if the reason for which I loved that book so much was not necessarily because I liked the storyline, or the characters, but because the aletheiometer was just so. damned. cool.  I want one, damnit.  The second and third books of the trilogy I liked quite a bit less (particularly the third), because by then, the religious subtext finally caught up to me and annoyed me.  Although the two angel-like creatures in <i>Amber Spyglass</i>? Soinlove.

9. Peter S. Beagle (The Last Unicorn) -- When I first read it, I thought it was the single most beautiful piece of literature I had ever read in my life.  I still think that.  I even liked the movie based on the book, and that almost never happens.

10. Sir Conan Arthur Doyle (Sherlock Holmes Series) -- You know, for the longest time, I genuinely thought Sherlock Holmes was (or at least was based on) a real person.  I was terribly crushed when I found out he was fictional.  And Watson's straight-man crush on Holmes always amused me -- could the man gush over him any <i>more?</i> 

</lj-cut>

In other news, my dad has finally nagged me into downloading and installing this thing called Skype, which is an free internet phone that allows one to communicate over the internet, much like... well, like a phone.  While this is obviously far more cost efficient than long-distance calling, it does have the rather unfortunate side effect of my no longer being able to use the money saving excuse when my parents pull out the whole ""you have so much <i>potential,</i> Julie, you need to think about your <i>future,</i> Julie, so get off your ass and start <i>planning</i>, damnit!"" lecture. *sigh*  They're lucky they're far enough away that I still miss them more than I'm annoyed by them.

Oh, also, talked to Iris' boyfriend.  He likes comics, and is suitably dorky, thus I approve of him.  The whole Star Trek Enterprise thing loses him a few points, though, because -- <i>Enterprise?</i>  I mean, if it were New Generation, I could still respect the guy, but... anyway."

"event","Here are the answers to the movie meme; I meant to do it over the weekend, but I forgot.


1. ""See? I'm as anatomically impaired as a Ken doll."" <b>This is from the movie <i>Dogma,</i> which is deliciously blasphemous and hilarious and surprisingly poignant.  It also features Alan Rickman (who is the speaker of the line) as Metatron, and Alanis Morisette as God.</b>

<s>2. ""Ladies' man, man's man, man about town.""</s> Down With Love <i>Well done, Dil, who got it first.  This movie made the list partly because it starred Ewan McGregor, and I am a weak, weak woman, and partly because I genuinely like the sentiment behind it, especially the fact that the guy had to give in to the girl, and not the other way around.</i>

<s>3. ""Am I not merciful?""</s> Gladiator <i>Also guessed by Dil.  I love this movie; it's incredibly moving, and both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were amazing in it.</i>

<s>4. ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist.""</s> The Usual Suspects <i>Guessed by Lili. I didn't understand this movie the first time I watched it, at least, not until later that night, at which time I literally sat up in bed and went ""OMFGHOLYSHIT!!!!!"" I adore movies that keep me guessing until the very last scene.</i>

<s>5. ""Inconceivable!""</s> The Princess Bride <i>Yeah, I thought you'd get this, Iris.  This movie is on the list simply because of that line, which is the single most hilarious one-word liner ever.  Also, great movie.</i>

<s>6. ""Do you know why the Yankees always win?""</s> Catch Me If You Can <i>Guessed by Iris.  This movie has always struck something in me because the whole putting on new identity after identity in order to fit into society until you barely remember who you actually are?  I emphasize with that, far more than I should.</i>

<s>7. ""Terrified... mortified... petrified... stupefied... by you.""</s> A Beautiful Mind <i>Guessed by Ming.  The first time I watched this movie, I felt so terribly sad for the protagonist, both because he was a burnt-out genuis, and also because he was forced to tamp down on his imagination in order to stay sane, and no one should have to do that.</i>

<s>8. ""I can't go all my life waiting to catch you between husbands. ""</s> Gone With the Wind <i>Guessed by Iris.  This movie I love because I've always admired -- and envied -- the way Scarlett had a man who knew all of her faults, and loved her relentlessly in spite of them.  Who doesn't want that?</i>

<s>9. ""There is no spoon.""</s> The Matrix <i>Guessed by Dil.  This movie is on the list because this is one of the best mind-fuck movies I have ever encountered.  But I'm still going to pretend that the second and third movies never existed.</i>

10. ""What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?"" <b>This line is from <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail.</i>  I've always thought that the English brought us North Americans two great things: Colin Frith and Monty Python.  Seriously, everyone should watch that movie, it is the single most hilarious thing in the world.</b>

11. ""I always thought it'd be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody."" <b>I think I made a mistake putting this line up, as it was kind of ambiguous and rather similar to a line in <i>Catch Me If You Can.</i> This line is, in fact, from <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley,</i> a movie that has a great deal in common with <i>Catch Me</i>.  I liked this movie because of the ending, the way Tom couldn't break free of his darkness.  I'm a sucker for unhappy endings, what can I say.</b>

<s>12. ""For ten years, I've drilled for oil in 93 countries, five different continents, and not once have I done anything to equal the grace of a well-thrown rock sliding down a sheet.""</s> Men With Brooms <i>Yes! Someone other than me has watched this movie! *hugs Lili*  I was actually genuinely surprised, when I first watched this movie, by how much it <b>didn't</b> suck.  Because, really, the premise is idiotic: it's a movie about curling.  But it was actually pretty good, and Paul Gross is an amazingly talented, ridiculously attractive man.</i> <b>edited to add: Also because it's Canadian. *grins at Lili*  And I do have to admit, as ridiculous as curling is, that very last throw Chris Cutter did?  I was at the edge of my seat.</b>"

The weird thing is that up until now, I've been floundering as to where to go for my future; it's never solidified until now.  And I think a major reason for that is simply because I don't think I can do it, and thus I want to go for it.

I've always been like that, striving for improbable goals that are only appealing because they are not <i>impossible.</i>  It's probably not a good thing, as I am likely setting myself up for disappointment, but there it is.

Median GPA: 3.8 (<I>3.8!!!</I>)
Median score on LSAT: 95th percentile

The latter of which is actually not that intimidating until:

Number of applicants in 2004: 1900
Number of students accepted: 170

And <i>then</i> I started freaking out.  I think I'm really, really going to have to work my ass off this year, and next year, and possibly even later, because it's highly unlikely that I'm going to get a 3.8 by the time I graduate.  It's all very discouraging.

On the bright side, I did make a new friend today.  We bonded over our lack of ability to find the room for our Philosophy of Law class.  Our aimless wandering eventually attracted the attention of a lovely young man army fatigues (I'm not kidding, he even had the hat), who lead us to our classroom."

I miss having stockings, and presents under a tree -- and the tree itself!

I did, however, do a great deal of clothes-shopping (by my standards, which would probably be laughable for most of you) this holiday season.  My purchases include:

- a belt that doesn't have a buckle, but instead has those two metal loops that you thread the tail through
- sweaters (only two! I'm trying to beat the addiction, really!)
- a pair of jeans (for $10. *bliss*)
- a few shirts and tops
<i>(and, my personal favourite:)</i>
- a tank top made entirely of black lace that shows a rather scandalous amount of cleavage. (It has been brought to my attention that I have fairly nice breasts, and that I should not be ashamed to show them off.  Also, I must admit that I felt a spark of glee when my proper, conservative parents took one look at that tank top and nearly had heart failure)

I also bought some CDs, DVDs, and -- this should come as a surprise to no one -- books.

Nonetheless, I'm still not looking forward to school starting tomorrow.  I'm going to be busier this term than I was last term, and I totally need to get my ass in gear or else I'll end up with a GPA of only 3.0 this year, which is not. acceptable.

Hope everyone else had a great Christmas, and Happy New Year (and good luck) to you all!"

But I went anyway.  It actually turned out to be the highlight of that day, as silly as it sounds.  It was also less shopping <i>with</i> Iris and more watching Iris shop while getting free stuff.  But she did get my birthday gift (Satsuma body lotion! Woo!) and my Christmas gift (hairclips! LADYBUG EARRINGS OMG!), so I am pleased.

The wicked siren also somehow managed to coerce me into trying on this camisole that was made entirely of red lace, which not so much pushed at the limits of my modesty as it completely uprooted said limits and carried them off to Florida.  But even I must admit that it was quite sexy, and showed off my... ahem, <i>assets</i> admirably.  Was very, very tempted to buy it.  

Work afterward was interesting.  Was hit on by a customer.  Also locked the tarps the wrong way, and thus had to redo them, which resulted in me not going home until almost 10pm.

Also, I need to get my laptop fixed, since the pin in the laptop that the recharger plugs into became detached and now I can't recharge my battery. *le sigh*

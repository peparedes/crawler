2. A handwritten note from one of the Room Parents in my 6th grade class. Apparently this woman is (was?) a poet of some kind and apparently she read some poem that I wrote back then (my memory of this is fuzzy at best) and then wrote me a note encouraging me to keep writing poetry! Even though I write mostly fiction now and not poetry so much, it still gave me that warm fuzzy feeling of ""awwwww, someone believes in me as a writer!"" Almost to the point where I want to track this woman down and say thank you for the random inspiration, even though she probably doesn't even remember me at all. (On a side tangent, I kind of remember her son as being one of those adorably shy boys who would be really nice and fun to hang out with if he could just TALK once in awhile...I wonder what he's up to now...maybe I should track him down as well!)

Anyway, room cleaning is done (in preparation for the SOIREE OF THE CENTURY in honor of my sister's graduation, which will descend upon our household this weekend) and now it's time for homework. Because you know, nothing says ""warm summer early June day"" like reading Edgar Allen Poe. :-P

"event","So remember M, the adorably awkward, shy, nerdy-cute boy who I (almost)dated for a grand total of a week before he started sending mixed messages (oh what am I talking about...he sent mixed messages the whole time!)and then essentially disappeared off of the planet the moment the New Year struck????

Well, after much overanalysis, I FINALLY figured him out.

Let's see...

-Shy and socially awkward. Stutters and melts at the very prospect of approaching a girl despite his side job as football announcer/public speaker.
-Allegedly keeps exceptionally busy (he's an English teacher, so his job keeps him busy from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. every day. And what does he do with the rest of his time that makes it so that he has NO FREE TIME? EVER? Oh, right, he's ""studying for the GRE."" Because that requires every spare moment of free time, you know.) 
-Pulled an amazing disappearing act on New Years Eve, of all nights, giving little information as to the sudden shift in plans, and not even an apology!
-Knows just about everything about...well, everything. Has read just about every book in the English canon (or at least knows enough to fake it), knows enough trivia to probably beat Ken Jennings in Jeopardy, and is a fabulous trumpet player to boot. Yet when you compliment him, he blushes and shrugs modestly as if it's all part of his duty. 
-Considered a career in journalism before settling on teaching.
-Has a pretty darn good body for someone so reclusive and bookwormish. Once again, that can be explained by marching band, which in our district is quite intense. More so than most sports, actually. But even so, the season is over and he's STILL lookin' good, long after most of the high schoolers have returned to flabbiness.
-Is very reluctant to share life experiences or even basic personal information. The guy doesn't even have a Facebook account for crying out loud! Who in this day and age doesn't have FB unless they're trying to hide something???
-Confessed to wearing tights once upon a time, allegedly for Madrigal Brass back in high school. And reportedly enjoyed it (though not TOO much, he claims!)
-Also has a reputation for wearing the knee-length vinyl red Marching Knight cloak (ahem, RAINCOAT) at every band competition...EVEN WHEN IT'S NOT RAINING!

I think based on this evidence, it is clear what this guy's deal is. 

CLEARLY he is a superhero!!!!! English teacher/band nerd by day, keeping the good people of Mokena, Illinois safe at night! Clearly that is why he is not ready for a relationship...how dare he get too close to a girl when his (and potentially her) very safety is in danger every day? What if they go out and the supervillain recognizes them? Besides, he's ""too busy"", remember? He can't afford to be distracted by such trivial things as romance when the safety of the world is at stake. Especially not on NEW YEARS EVE...prime night for drunk driving accidents. Surely some innocent person required his mighty intervention! And surely no one would suspect an ENGLISH TEACHER, a profession known for effeminate, cerebral men more concerned with telling the difference between Burns and Keats, not the sort of machismo that inevitably comes from battling supervillains and stopping asteroids in mid-air! (Then again, let's not forget that the pen is mightier than the sword). 

Sealing the deal is the fact that the guy has TWO FIRST NAMES...Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent...need I mention that our dear M's last name (which, to protect his fragile alter ego, I will not write out) was also the 152nd most popular FIRST name for boys in the year 1985, when he was born (and delightfully nerdy-sounding!) 

Yup, makes sense now! And all this time I was thinking he was at best, hopelessly confused and at worst, an arrogant, self-centered jerk! Glad I finally figured it out so now I can lay the matter to rest! :-)"

"event","So I got kind of bored during subbing today and noticed a pile on the teacher's desk marked ""Young Authors Final Drafts""...it was quite an amusing way to pass an hour. And I learned sooo much! 

-Everyone in FL goes to Disney World every day
-Orlando, Florida is apparently a beach town
-""Hi, my name is...and I am 5'2 with brown hair, blue eyes and freckles"" is the best way to begin a story.
-It is possible to bike to the top of Mt. Everest and surfboard back down in three hours. But the obvious plothole was reconciled by the fact that the character, Luke, lives in Nepal. 
-Goldfish are capable of swimming from FL to England in only a few hours
-There is a period of history called the ""mid evil ages"".
-Japan is full of ninjas named Camren
-If you take an 8th grade level class called ""Doctors In Hospitals,"" you are qualified to become a surgeon's assistant
-$10 is a fair price to ask for a diamond necklace
-16 year old girls are apparently obsessed with Hannah Montana.

Balancing out all of these plotholes and fact twists, however, is the fact that many of the students took ""write what you know"" to an all new level and managed to incorporate some rather sophisticated jargon of their interest areas. And of course, let's not forget that there is a flip side...AT LEAST THIS SCHOOL TEACHES CREATIVE WRITING AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!! *saves that rant for another time*

hahahahaha, good to be back! :-) Hope y'all had a much better New Years Eve than I did! (yeah, boys are stupid!)On the plus side, though, I saw Princess and the Frog. Twice! :-)"

So I've been completely stuck on what to do with this one character in my novel and then my cousin got me the new Josh Groban CD and this song pretty much captures his state of mind perfectly, giving me a new tangent for my story. Love it when that happens! Thanks Cousin Sarah! :-)

and I'm pretty sure that if I ever get writer's block again, I could write a series of non-fiction humor essays, perhaps in the style of David Sedaris, about my crazy family and the other folks in my hometown. 

Not to mention that New Years Eve should be quite...interesting, to say the least! I shall keep you all (and by ""you all"", I mean Sarah because I highly doubt anyone else actually reads this) posted.

"event","*To people who I am 99.9999% sure will never read this

1. No one cares how cute you and your boyfriend are together. I used to think it was adorable that you two had finally found each other, but when you start ignoring your best friends and completely usurping each other's identities to the point where you are no longer unique individuals, that's not cute. You seriously make me want to barf each time I see you together, even on Facebook.

2. That wasn't as awkward as it could have been. I'm glad. Life is too short to be angry over something like this.

3. I'm glad we started talking again. We were best friends before all of this stupid drama happened...and for that, I'm deeply sorry (even though you were equally at fault). Still, though, I don't regret any of it. I learned some valuable lessons and I'm sorry I had to hurt you in the process. Thanks for not hating me forever and I'm glad we can both move on and be happy.

4. After liking you for seven years, I've finally realized that our relationship will never be more than casual friendly acquaintances. It's okay though. You're a great person and I probably never would have made it through my sophomore year of high school without you. And you still make me smile just as much now as you did back then. :-)

5. I just realized that it has been six months since I talked to you, and that seems so strange since you used to be one of my best friends! Some of the best times of college involved talking to you for hours and hours and hours about any silly thing our minds could come up with! Miss you and sorry for losing touch! I'll call you one of these days, I promise! 

6. You are so beautiful and so strong! Hang in there--life WILL get better some day! 

7. I know you were an arrogant jerk back in the day, but I've forgiven you. Glad we're friends now :-)

8. You never were a mean person. People were mean to you when you were having a hard time in life and you got carried away and took it out on others. I'd say you turned out alright in the long run, though.

9. Please, please please please ask me out! Even if you don't want to date me, that's okay. I can live with that. But you intrigue me like no other and I know we have a lot in common. Just take the time to get to know me...I promise you it will be worth it!

10. It's been three years and I still think about you every day. 

11. Umm, that was really mean. I tried to forgive you and move on, but being excluded still really hurts. I think we can be close again but it will take some time. 

12. I'm sorry for misjudging you before I got to know you. Contrary to popular belief, I don't hate you and I hope you don't hate me. If there is anything I can do to make it up to you, please let me know!

13. GET A FREAKING JOB!!! You are so lazy and you are never going to get anywhere in life unless you find some way to make yourself stand out! I know you're smart and interesting, but no one else will unless you start doing something with yourself other than sitting around and whining about lost opportunities! Be proactive for once!

14. You have the ugliest, whiniest most annoying dog I have ever seen.

15. It's not the quantity of friends that is most important but the quality of friends."

Among my new favorite albums are Ella Fitzgerald's ""Ella Wishes You A Swingin' Christmas"" (thanks Holly!) and Transsiberian Orchestra's ""Christmas Eve And Other Stories."" And on the Transsiberian Orchestra one, I found this extremely depressing but ultimately beautiful song. It made me cry a little:

 	ORNAMENT

There is an ornament
Lost inside the night
There on a Christmas tree
With a thousand lights

No one can see her
She's standing all alone

Somewhere she glistens where no one can see

I don't believe I can say what had happened
All of those words that we put into play
No longer matter, I should have known that then
I just know you're far away

On this Christmas day
On this Christmas day
On this Christmas ....

Somewhere the wind
Carves moments in the snow

And if he sees her
He never lets it show
He just drifts behind her
Erasing every step

Tinsel and garland are whispered
through trees

I don't believe I can say what
had happened
All of those words that we put
into play
No longer matter, I should have
known that then
I just know you're far away

On this Christmas day
On this Christmas day
On this Christmas ....

Come, Christmas
Stay, Christmas
Watch over her this day
Keep her
Protect her
From harm now in every way

Shelter her
Gently
There in your arms she'll be
Until the day
When you
Bring her back home to me

There is an ornament lost inside the night

He leaves on Friday. Today is Monday going on Tuesday in 17 minutes. Probably forever. Maybe that's why it made me cry, because it speaks to my own situation. :-("

"event","When I first heard of the popularity of the Twilight books, I figured that, as a hopeful young adult fiction writer, I have to read them. Marketing research, I suppose. But now, being almost done with New Moon (aka halfway through the series), I am being sucked in more and more.

Which is ironic for an overly  analytical literary snob like me because in many ways, they are completely ridiculous books. The plot is over-the-top, the writing style melodramatic, and the characters flat. Bella is so passive and obsessed with Edward that it makes my inner feminist scream ""DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE, girl! He's not good for you anyway, and sitting there being depressed when he leaves is a waste of time because HE'S NOT COMING BACK!"" But then he does...which is probably not a good message to send to impressionable middle-graders. 

Not that Edward is that great of a catch anyway. He's always come across to me as a bit creepy (and not just because he's a vampire)...even to the point where he seems abusive. He's hot, yes, but what is their relationship  based on, anyway? They never do anything except cuddle, make out, talk about being a vampire, and mooning over each other. My friend Liz who seems to be an expert on vampire novels tells me that the weak heroine falling in lust with a powerful vampire despite an utter lack of personality is fairly typical, which I think makes me even more disappointed. Stephenie Meyer had the chance to turn this cliche around, but she didn't. 

But yet, I am essentially in love with these crazy books anyway. Why? I don't know. Meyer does do a good job of creating tension in her plot, which I can admire since my own stories seem to revolve around awesome characters doing nothing but sitting around being awesome. In the Twilight books, things happen, creating suspense along the way. I also appreciate the themes, for however cliche being in love with the wrong person is, it never gets old because I think most people can relate in some way. 

And, on a personal note, THEY GO TO ITALY! Awesome!"

Well, yes, maybe it is my fault, and I hate myself for it right now, but saying it's ""disappointing"" is like saying that surviving an atomic bomb attack is ""unfortunate."" Maybe that's a little too dramatic of an analogy, but THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!!

So tomorrow, I'm supposed to call ORL, who I really don't trust at all for anything, let alone handling my deepest darkest secrets and politely ask them to send them back. Unless, of course, the janitor already threw them away, or, even worse, took them home and read it. 

It would be an interesting read, though. Honestly, life sometimes is stranger than fiction, especially mine right now. 

But ohhhhhh crap oh crap oh crap oh crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","I gave my novel a happily-ever-after ending. 

So out of character for me. I love sweet love stories, but in real life, they very rarely work out in a happily-ever-after way, at least not for me, and at least not without some considerable mess involved, so reading about how people in books CONSTANTLY get all of their romantic dreams fulfilled just because they are characters in a book with a benevolent author kind of frustrates me. Maybe it's because it gives me false expectations in life...I don't know.

So in most of my stories, the love stories are always beautiful but tragically flawed, and that tragic flaw leads to the doom of the relationship, as well as a heartbroken but ultimately stronger character who will survive and go on without that special person in their life.

That's what I was going for in my latest novel (not to give anything away, but it's pretty hard to have a happily-ever-after when the protagonist's love object is DEAD), but, of course, when I was doing revisions, a new love object popped into the story out of nowhere. And, like the poor protagonist, I fell in love with him, so now he's here to stay. But it actually works because the protagonist is such a quixotic hopeless romantic that I can't really see her ending up any other way. I can justify it by making the rest of her life suck so much that he is the only good thing going for her.

No, I'm not a cynical person. Not at all. :-D"

Sooooo...May Term. Here's what's new with me:

-It's May Term and I can count the number of true friends who are still on campus on one hand. That means that I am getting very good at entertaining myself. Fortunately, I had the experience of being an only child for the formative first four years of live, so it's not too hard, but I really miss my friends!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

-I would so much rather be in Europe like ten people I can think of right now...oh well, I got to go last year, and I really have no right at all to complain, but it would be SOOO much better than here right now. 

-Relationships are complicated. If you need to know, you do know.

-I am involved in a love/hate relationship with my adolescent of a novel. One of my projects for May Term is to finish revising it (or at least finish this particular revision stage). I rewrote huge chunks of it, and the more I work on it, the more work I realize it needs. And I love it, I really do, but a part of me really just wants to be done with it so I can start a new one because I have an AWESOME idea that's been hanging out in my brain for months now! Is that normal?

-I miss my internship at the history museum. When I was doing it, I couldn't wait for it to be over, but now, I really really miss it. I almost cried at the volunteer reception, even though it was me and about a hundred geriatrics. But I feel like I learned a lot and did a good thing for the community at the same time. And I feel so much more connected to this town now because of it. I know the stories of the people streets are named after, and even though no one else cares, it seems like a sort of in-joke between the city planners and me. :-D

-I CAN'T WAIT FOR SUMMER! Becauuusseee...I HAVE THE MOST AWESOME INTERNSHIP EVER!!!!! I will be doing public relations for Brookfield Zoo and I am soooooo excited! I was the little kid who thought the zoo was the most exciting thing ever, and I still haven't quite outgrown that. At worst, it will be seven bad weeks redeemed by the presence of dolphins. At best, it could be the best experience of my life and perhaps give me a whole new direction at life. 

Well, that's it for tonight. Tune in next time! :-D"

"event","10 days until the first part of the autobiography is due, and I still have no idea what to write about. I think the professor really wants it to be about this semester, but I have some fundamental philosophical problems with that:

1. The defining struggles of my life right now are just that, defining struggles. Therefore, they are still present in my life and the outcome, aka, the definition part of them has not been made clear yet. It's like what Professor Miller said back in AP Seminar, that the Law of Unintended Consequences makes it impossible to get an accurate, big-picture view of historical events until a significant amount of time has passed. Sometimes, this is years or even decades. I don't think I need decades to write this autobiography, seeing as I am only 20 years old, but at the same time, some things are just too close to the present to really be able to analyze and present in an intelligent way.

2. My journal and thoughts right now are PRIVATE! Maybe I just read too much Harriet the Spy as a kid, but it has always been one of my biggest paranoid fears that someone will read my journal. Not that I have any deep dark secrets that I'm trying to hide, but I use that as my personal space to vent, sometimes about people and situations that are very close to me, and I am afraid that it will be taken out of context. I know the teacher is the only person who will read it, but still...what if something happens??? These people and events are still close to me and often play significant parts in my life, and if they discovered it, the consequences could be devastating. Plus, if anyone is to read my journal, that is pretty much the number one way to make me never want to trust you again. And even if I fictionalize it or change some names and events, I really don't feel comfortable just handing it over to the teacher.

3. Certain defining struggles took place in this professor's class. Not this exact class, but a fiction writing class with the same teacher. Really interesting and pretty much essential to understanding me the way I am. It's since been resolved and I think I'm a better person because of it, but I would have to be really careful to find a way of presenting it without making the professor and certain classmates angry in my (truthful) portrayal of them.

4. Ok, so I could just take all that stuff out. And then what's left. Going to class and going my internship. Booooooring!

5. Structure: I am really excited about this project, but I really don't want it to just read like one of those second grade timelines. ""I was born. And then I went to kindergarten. And then I went to Disney World. And then I won the spelling bee."" But then at the same time, I don't really want it to bounce all over the place and make the chronology impossible to follow. An even bigger problem is how to pick and choose events that are meaningful, insightful, and interesting to write about. Right now, it could be epic. A big, long, epic mess of things thrown together with no real theme or sense of continuity. But I don't have time for that. I'm writing a novel and a history book and learning Latin and trying to apply for internships and reading all these other books for class and trying to micromanage my slowly disintegrating social life...yeah, it's a little insane. Sooo...I think I need to pick a theme or something and show how it's developed throughout my life. 

Or maybe I just think about this waaaaaay too much! But if you have any insights, PLEASE let me know!"

Ever since Meta last weekend, I've been going to bed at 12 instead of 1. It's amazing how much better I feel. I haven't felt the need to take a nap once this whole week and, as a result, I get more homework done and I'm not as tired during my morning Latin class...then again, the teacher probably thinks I'm a total space cadet because my natural stupidity just seems to manifest itself  more at 9:00 a.m. Sum puellam stultam.

but anyway, new semester, new novel, new start. Which is really just what I needed at this point. I'm not going to give away too much about my novel, but I'm pretty excited! Influences: Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lightkeeper's Daughter, William Shakespeare, my childhood. My teacher and my group members all said they liked my pitch for it, so I'm happy! :-D 

The problem: Teacher expects 15 pages a week! At first that wasn't so bad. I was just like ""yaaaay novel!!!!!!!!!""  But then I realized that it's pretty much like writing a giant research paper EVERY WEEK!!! It's still more fun than a giant research paper every week. It's gonna be busy though, considering I also have an internship and two other classes, including one where the project is...write your own autobiography! So basically I'm trying to write three books in one semester. 

Is it nerdy that I'm excited about that?

Excited and kinda intimidated at the same time. 

But oh well. My social life seems to be in a bit of a recession these days, so maybe that's better from an academic perspective. Guess we'll just see what happens...

And I finished reading The Perfect Man for STD. *reads how that sentence sounds. Wow...*  What I mean is that STD requires that I read The Perfect Man. (which is a BOOK! And in case you didn't read the last entry, STD=Sigma Tau Delta=English Honor Society.) *gives up on trying to make it sound socially acceptable* Tee hee. I'm so mature. 

But what I meant to say is that I really don't like the ending. I seem to be very cynical about romantic plots/subplots lately, probably because so many of them just aren't believeable. This case was even worse, though, because it was believable, but offered too much false hope. Yeah, that didn't make sense, but it does to me...and don't ask me to elaborate because I'm not going to. 

Now I'm reading The Lightkeeper's Daughter, by Iain Lawrence. I've read it a few other times in junior high, but it's soooo good, even though it's kinda young adult-ish, and not particularly believable. But I think it might help me with my own novel in some ways, so I'm revisiting it.

Think I'll go do that now.

Took the journalism midterm earlier and I'm not hoping for too much, but I'm pretty sure it was better than the last one. And I've been working on my Julia Alvarez paper for Caribbean Voices, which I was looking forward to because I absolutely LOVED In the Time of the Butterflies, but when I sat down to write my paper, I couldn't really think of an intelligent thesis, so I kinda just wrote down as many quotes as I possibly could and strung them together with bizarre tangents. At least it makes sense inside my mind...

But onto more interesting topics...

I FINISHED MY NOVEL!!!!!!!!!!! FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know I said that before, but what I meant was that I finished writing it. And now I'm done actually editing/formatting it and I am sooo proud of myself! I really want to give them out as Christmas gifts to my family, but I'm kinda scared to. I know that my family will love it and be all ""awwwwww look how talented my daughter/sister is,"" but at the same time...will they really like it? Or even understand it? Not that I'm a surrealist or postmodernist or specialize in bizarre things that make no sense, but there are a lot of historical references that I did lots of research to uncover, and hopefully they won't throw the reader too off-track. I suppose I could add a glossary or something in the back to explain it, but it might take away from the story and make it too didactic. We'll see, we'll see. And ironically, I finished it on the same day I went to the first meeting for the 300-level ""Writing the Literary Novel"" seminar class I'm in next semester. The teacher seems a little New Age-y (""fiction comes from the dream-space inside of you...breathe deeply, close your eyes, and access it"" type stuff), but I am soooo excited!

And otherwise, life is pretty good! It hasn't been snowing much yet, but the ground is pretty much covered in a layer of ice that makes it feel like the whole campus has been plasticized. I haven't slipped yet, either, which is pretty much amazing! And as soon as finals are done, I get to go home and celebrate Christmas! Yaaaay! My favorite time of year...I've been to soooo many Christmas parties this last week *tries to count them. Comes up with an ambiguous number between four and five.*  

Oooooh, and I got the internship at the history museum! That will be exciting! I can't wait, although I'm a little nervous since I turned down three other good offers...hopefully I picked the right one! Otherwise, I've been keeping busy going to interviews, doing homework, and being the Daisy Buchanan to someone's Great Gatsby...(and at first I typed in ""Daisy Duke"" instead of ""Daisy Buchanan""...WOW it's been a long time since 11th grade English!)

Anywho, I GOT MY COMPUTER BACK!!!!!! Finally! 

I hate to admit it, but it was kinda nice being freed from the bonds of technology. For once, I wasn't distracted by late-night AIM conversations (not that late night AIM conversations are always a bad thing), and it actually took considerable effort to check FBook (as I now affectionately call it!

I'm trying to get as many Argus articles done before applying for internships while simultaneously tracking down that elusive ""A"". As of now, I've gotten a C, a heck of a lot of Bs, and a tantalizingly-close A minus! 

And yet, that's not good enough for me. Because when it comes to writing, I'm just a perfectionist like that. Period.

OOOOOH! AND I GOT INTO STD!!!!!!!!

no, I do not HAVE an STD. I'm not that kinda girl. If you know me at all, you would know that. But I apparently meet the criteria to join Sigma Tau Delta. All jokes about their unfortuate acronym aside (still, you'd think a bunch of English majors would know better than that...), I am pretty darn excited! Maybe there is hope for me after all...

"event","Tribe Did Not OK Whale Shooting
By Associated Press
6 hours ago

NEAH BAY, Wash. - The Makah Indian Tribe's whaling commission did not authorize the killing of a gray whale that died after being harpooned and shot several times in northwest Washington's Strait of Juan de Fuca, a member of the tribal panel said.

""The commission had not reviewed this,"" Chad Bowechop told the Peninsula Daily News in a story that appeared Sunday.

The U.S. Coast Guard detained five men believed to have killed the whale on Saturday, then turned them over to tribal police for further questioning.

Tribal officials did not return calls from The Associated Press. The tribe's chairman, Ben Johnson, told The Seattle Times that tribal whalers were out practicing hunting skills Saturday in keeping with their treaty rights to hunt whales.

Witnesses said the gray whale had been harpooned a few miles east of Neah Bay and that five men on two small boats fired shots from what sounded like a high-caliber rifle.

Mark Oswell, a spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said investigators are looking into whether the whale was killed because it had become entangled in a fishing net.

The whale was headed toward the Pacific Ocean after being wounded and later disappeared beneath the surface, dragging down buoys that had been attached to a harpoon. A biologist for the tribe declared the animal dead, Petty Officer Shawn Eggert said.

Coast Guard Petty Officer David Marin said his agency had no information indicating the whale had gotten trapped in netting before it was shot.

The men who killed the whale could face federal civil penalties of up to $20,000 each, said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the fisheries service.

The federal government removed the gray whale from the endangered species list in 1994. Five years later, with a permit from the National Marine Fisheries Service, Makah tribal members killed their first whale in seven decades.

Animal welfare activists sued, leading to a court order that the tribe must obtain a waiver under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act to continue hunting whales.

On Sunday, the Humane Society of the United States and its international arm called the killing ""extremely disturbing"" and called for the government to cease its consideration of the Makah's waiver request until a full investigation of the killing is complete.

John McCarty, a former tribal whaling commission member who has been an advocate of the Makah's right to resume whaling, said the tribe had been close to obtaining the waiver.

""I don't know why they did this. It's terrible,"" McCarty told The Times. ""I think the anti-whalers will be after us in full force, and we look ridiculous. Like we can't manage our own people, we can't manage our own whale."""

"event","Wow...school has started and I still can't get over how fantastic this summer was. Fantastic in a totally surreal and unbelievable way...like it was all a long dream, but I never quite woke up.

So if someone asks me what I did this summer, here is what I can tell them:

-Visited 8 foreign countries (Italy, Vatican City, Austria, The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France, and England) and 3 states (Indiana, Ohio, Florida)

-Filled in 25% of my family tree that was previously a complete mystery.

-Hung out with my cousins from Pennsylvania

-Worked. Earned over $1000 (possibly even $2,000!), edited a webpage written by engineers, helped with design-testing, did marketing research, and WROTE AND DESIGNED the new webpage!!!

-Made a monster-baby scrapbook

-Wrote a historical novella. I found a book about the period recently and found out exactly how many historical inaccuracies it has, so it will still take some more work (and perhaps a complete reworking of the plot), but at least the rough draft is done.

-Redefined several relationships.

-Reconnected with 3 people I haven't seen since high school.

-FINALLY met the son of my dad's Australian business partner, whom I have heard stories about since I was a kid and never actually met.

-Continued to support my sister in her marching band endeavours.

-Improved my relationship with God and refined my views on theology.

-Fell in love with the following musical geniuses: Vivaldi, Mozart, Camille Saint-Saens, Die Prinzen, Lifehouse, Gustav Holst, Harry Potter 5 soundtrack, Paul Simon.

-Realized and accepted the true extent of my nerdiness

-Read several books

-Still had time to sit around being bored."

Live my life around a picture

Taken when we met

Spending all of my time

Chasing your silhouette

For all we go through

I don't wanna change you

It's my mind running in reverse

To take it back to the start

And through the rise and falling apart

We discover who we are



Struggling with my thoughts

Change the locks inside my head

Reading between the lines

Of what you say, and what you said

I turn the radio on

To drown me out

Driving through the night to nowhere

"event","NO MORE DR. PAVLIK!!!!! EVER!!!!!! :-D After nine years of being seriously afraid of my orthodontist (he's a scary, scary man! Seriously! Dentists are scary anyway, but especially if they are FORENSIC DENTISTS!), I no longer have to set foot in his office! Unless of course, I miss him-HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I think not...

But otherwise, I think things will be ok. I go back to school in a little less than 2 weeks, and I have soooo much to do before then! Lots of people to see, projects to finish, and things to accumulate. And, of course, the little monster baby I like to call my Concert Halls and Cathedrals scrapbook. I worked on it almost all day today and and currently working on the Wiener Staatsoper. Wiener Staatsoper is a fun word to say. Too bad it only means ""Vienna Opera House""-not that exciting. But I've developed a new appreciation for the German language this summer. I love how, if they can't find a word for something, they just take all the adjectives they can think of to describe it and blend them together into a mega-compound word.

But anyway, I was cleaning out my desk the other day, and I might as well have been on an archaeological dig. Not only is a lot of the stuff ancient, but some of it is quite fascinating.  Among other things:
-My wisdom teeth. (ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!)
-A Christmas card from Dillon that says ""Merry Christmas"" on the front and shows a manatee being harpooned on the inside. Boy, THOSE were the days...
-A pile of checks that, when added up and deposited, totaled over $1,200!
-More pens and pencils than I, even as an English major, could ever hope to use.
-Several battered and decapitated Kinder Egg toys.

As crazy as things are, I feel a sort of energy boost as I scratch things off the list. Because each thing crossed off takes me one step closer to being back at school! But I've actually been happier this week (and last) than I've been in awhile. I did a lot of thinking about things in Florida-about myself, about God, about my goals for this year, and you know what? I've come to the conclusion that everything will be ok. I don't really understand it, and maybe I never will, but God made me and he made me special and he has a plan for me, and it will all work out in the end. Some people are in my life for a reason, even if it's not the reason I thought, and then there are some things that I need to let go of. But in the end, it will be ok. 

One thing that is suffering is my story. I had this huge creative surge in Florida, and I wrote like crazy during that trip, but since I've been back, my mind has kind of pooped out in that regard. I probably could have finished it on the plane, but noooo! My parents made me sit in the middle seat, and I'm too paranoid to write well when I am surrounded by people (yeah, I know that's kinda weird, but pretty much all writers have quirks like that), so I ended up just reading Suite Francais and attempting (and failing miserably) to sleep. And now, I have absolutely no motivation to finish it. Maybe because writing this story seemed to be a sort of catharsis for negative feelings and now those feelings are gone? I don't really know. But hopefully I'll get my groove back and finish it before school starts, because I know that when school starts, I'll be writing for others and not for me and so I'll never get around to it. 

Right now, the #1 most played song on my iPod is Vivaldi's ""Quattro Stagioni-L'Inverno-Allegro Non Molto."" Yeah, I'm a nerd like that. AND I LOVE IT! :-)"

Plus, it has a good message of accepting diversity, not giving up on your dreams, and recognizing talents in others. It definitely shows that sometimes things are not as they seem.

"event","Ok, so I'm back at work now...whoop-de-do! And today, I'm doing virtually nothing, so I guess I'm not really procrastinating, but The Boss/Dad is in a meeting now...

I went for my regular walk during breaktime today and there was a man on the other side of the fence separating our company property from theirs. He saw me walking and started yelling at me, things like: ""I see you looking, girl! You're looking for something!!!!"" And yeah, I guess I am. I just wish I knew what.

I seem to have lost my favorite LJ friend. And yeah, I understand your reason, and I think it's probably for the best, but still, your cyberpresence will be greatly missed. Especially since you made up about 1/2 the readership of De Profundi Anime :-(

And I'm back from Europe now and it was absolutely fantastic! From the wet and foggy Dutch landscapes to the eery Romanticism of the German castles to a Venice as colorful as a mask and as vibrant as a Vivaldi symphony to the majestic mountains of Switzerland to seeing the Eiffel Tower lit up like a giant candle on my 20th birthday to my old friend London with whom I share many passions, especially literature, history, and a fondness for Earl Gray. Lemme tell you, it was soooo nice to get away from everything, even if it was just for two weeks. And, of course, when I came back, everything is just sitting there waiting for me, as if I never left, but at least I can be assured that things are moving in the right direction. Even if I am unsure sometimes, I know that there is hope and that it will be ok. 

And now I can't say I am out of writer's inspiration anymore. If Europe is good for anything, it is good for generating new landscapes, settings, and characters for stories. Especially in the way of Romanticism and/or historical fiction, which are quickly becoming my new personal favorites. I mean, Romanticism is everywhere! I saw it in Germany along the Rhine Cruise, in the fairy-tale kingdoms of Neuschwanstein and Linderhof, and even in Munich with the old and new town halls. And then there was Venice, a city floating on water and almost too dreamy to be real. And then there were the Swiss Alps, which inspired the 19th century English Romantics like Mary Shelley and her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley. And in London, there was the Phantom of the Opera-you can't get more desperately, hopelessly Romantic than that! 

Ever since I've been back, I've felt this compulsion to write and write and write and get these stories out of me. Maybe then I can have some peace of mind and things will fall together. Maybe I need to be like King Ludwig II of Bavaria and create my own fantasy world to escape into. People thought he was crazy, though...then again, who says I'm not a bit loony myself? I tried to work on my story on the plane back from London, but I have this weird insecurity about writing a story when there are people nearby, and I had the middle seat, so that didn't work. Oh well...I got LOTS of much needed sleep (I fell asleep over Scotland and woke up in Canada!), plus, I had my BRITISH EDITION of Harry Potter 7 to keep me company. I have 3 or 4 more chapters to go now, and it's getting pretty intense!!!!!!!!!!!! There will probably be a follow-up post elaborating more once I finish it.

And I hear the bottle organ playing, which implies that there is someone nearby...gotta go! Ciao!"

Not at all what I was expecting from a kiddie book, but...wow! I feel kind of dorky getting this excited over a book that seems to have been written for 9-year olds, but somehow I never got around to reading the Chronicles of Narnia as a kid, and then the movie came out and the cinematography is gorgeous, and I LOVE the soundtrack, so I decided to read the books, and then I quite serendipitously encountered the Complete Collection of Narnia at Sam's Club for only $7.50, which was too good of a deal to pass up, and so I've been reading the Narnia books off and on for the past year and a half. It probably wouldn't have taken me that long to read them if I just read all of them straight through, but I kinda used them as ""fillers"" between other books because they are so short and easy to read, but I love them!!!!!!!! My favorites were probably The Magician's Nephew, The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe, and ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"", but the Christian symbolism and the parallels to the end of the world in the Christian worldview were extraordinary in ""The Last Battle."" In a way, I can tie it into my own life and apply it to all the craziness swirling around inside my own head these days. I guess that's the mark of good literature when you can find those themes and apply it to your own life. Then again, Narnia makes it pretty obvious...but still...

And for a different perspective, I have ""The Life of Pi"" stashed away in my carry-on ready to go on vacation with me. It looks interesting (in a philosophical sort of way) from the back cover, but Ben and Liz both recommended it and they have good taste in literature (at least Ben does), so I'm excited! And then there is the imminent release of Harry Potter 7!!!!! What will the literary world be like without the anticipation of another Harry Potter book!?!?!?!?
Unfortunately, I'm going to miss the release of the movie (unless I want to watch it in German!), but I should be strategically placed to pick up a British edition of the new book! :-) And then I have a strategically placed 8-hour plane ride to read it...yay!"

I just got an iPod nano, which is absolutely fantastic, but I just spent the last HOUR and a HALF trying to figure out how to transfer music from SonicStage to iTunes, failing miserably, and practically destroying both programs in the process. In light of my recent 5-hour long epic battle with the scanner at work, I am beginning to think that maybe I should just renounce all modern technology and just become a technological nun. Even the Stone Age is preferable to this Computer Age where people are horrible inept at maintaining friendships without the aid of Stalkbook, wireless internet has conditioned people to become incredibly impatient with everything, and eyesight is waning due to countless hours staring at a screen. I'm guilty of a lot of these things too, but I can't help but find our present dependency on technology absolutely appalling. Sure, it makes things convenient, but when it goes wrong, which is quite often, it becomes INCREDIBLY frustrating and wastes way more time and energy than it is originally intended to save. And what are historians going to have to look at and study our culture in the future? Everything nowdays is saved on the global (and extremely perverted) brain known as the Internet, but what happens when computers become obsolete? Nothing that complex can be permanent. Is anyone really naive enough to think that in several centuries, an archaeologist will be able to dig up a computer, plug it in, and access all of the records of the 21st century? I don't think so. And even if they do, all they will find is lots of porn and countless articles about Paris Hilton, who they will probably assume is an important deity of some sort. Pen and paper may be inefficient, but hey, at least it doesn't take a genius to understand it.

Anyway...

Despite my little rant about technology, life has been pretty good this week. MUCH better than last week! A lot of things have been cleared up and I think things will be ok! :-) I leave for Europe in one week from today, and I am sooooooooooo excited!!!!!! And I've been working a lot, which is actually not too bad since I'm making some really good money and I get to do more writing and editing this year instead of office aide drudgery. There is still some icky filing and data-entering, but not nearly as much as last year. Dad's a tough boss, but at least he is fair and tries to give me jobs that allow me to learn something in the process. And I've been working on my story, too! I think it's coming along-very slowly, but it's progressing. I really want to finish it by the end of the summer, but I'm not sure how feasible that is considering that I also have to do my monster scrapbook. Ok, that's enough for now!

"event","Ladies and Gentlemen,
We stand on the brink of a great precipice.  Our country, nay all mankind, are more prepared than ever to live lives of fulfillment and joy.

But, There are those among us who seek to disrupt this Utopia.  People like British author, J.R.R. Rowling, and his books of evil and sorcery which are prevalent among youths of our society.  These books are pure, concentrated evil, in paperback form, and only by understanding this evil, and rallying against it, can our world be saved.  With that, I present to you 13 indisputable facts, which we will refer to as:



While there are in fact countless points which can be made against this series of ""novels,"" I have chosen to whittle my list down to the 13 most egregious evils, the 13 listed below.  ""Why 13?"" you might ask.  I'll tell you.  13 is a known evil number, and with this article I hope to turn their own evil against them.  Also, I have 13 cats who I love.  Consider it a tribute.

Does Tolerance Mean Nothing?

When Children read stories like these, they instantly begin to relate with the characters.  To empathize with the characters.  To begin to want be like the characters.  So, What message is Mr. Rowling sending when he makes one of the main characters an awful bigot?
That's right, the character known as Draco Malfoy, one of the most vital characters in the story, is no more than a bigot and a spoiled little shit.  Often times he can be found insulting those who are worse off than he, as well as insulting ""mudbloods,"" or people who are not born of magical parents.  

Why, the children who are reading these books also are not magical.  What can they do, being as they are merely ""muggles"" (a derogatory word for non-magical, god-loving people.)  You see, these books, using this bigotry, tell the kids they will not be equals with their idol Malfoy, until they too take up the dark art of magic.
  
Hermione (portrayed by Emma Watson,) performs a ""Heil"" in HP:PoA
 
 

All Bow to the King?

Get this, the author behind this whole mess isn't from America.

That's right, not only are our children being corrupted, its being done by a lousy foreigner.  From GREAT BRITAIN.  Now, I could be wrong, but I don't think we fought for and won our Independence just for shits and giggles.  We did it so we didn't have to listen to what goofy, rotten-toothed limeys have to say any more.

So, knowing this, why do we still allow their inferior products to come into our great lands, corrupting our children's minds with anti-Jesus propaganda?  I see no need for Britain, and no need for these books.

If Britain wants to peddle their goods in our land, like some kind of ally, maybe they should consider showing a little comradery with the United States.

When's the last time they helped us out with anything at all?  Exactly, so why are we helping their satanic authors to earn a living?

Well He Didn't Use A Spell To Get These Ideas

I'm sure you've all heard the story how Mr. Rowling came up with this idea while working as a bartender, and scribbled notes down on the bottom of coasters.  What I'm sure you haven't heard of is the man who these ideas really came from.

That man was a little known magician and illusionist from the early 1900's.  His Name?

Harry Houdini.

Now, you have probably never heard of this man, his work did not garner much acclaim, however he is single handedly responsible for coining a magic phrase called ""Abra Kadabra.""  Fortunately Mr. Houdini was not actually in a pact with Satan, and as such, this phrase holds no evil power.  Despite this however, Rowling still chose to steal this line and claim it as his own.  You see, ""Abra Kadabra"" is also the phrase used to cast the most powerful spell in Rowling's world, a spell which kills instantly.

So could it be a coincidence that this phrase is stolen letter-for-letter from the dead magician?  Yes.  Is it?  Not likely.  Mr. Rowling is a liar and a thief.

Yeah, Maybe If It Were Hogwarts School of Cleaning and Cake-Baking

 
Somebody  should tell this woman (Rowling's wife perhaps?) that the only thing a woman needs a broom for is sweeping the damn house.
 
 Perhaps one of the more laughable aspects of these novels, is the portrayal of female characters.
More specifically, the portrayal of female characters as equal to their male counterparts.

Please, this is not the kind of drivel that we need infecting the minds of our impressionable young children.  These ideas, once ingrained, are very difficult to get rid of, and can only lead to confusion later in life when the children realize that the role of the woman is to assist the man in whatever way necessary.

Any sane adult knows, that whether it be cooking, cleaning, or spitting out babies, a woman's job is to satisfy her man.  Period.  End of discussion.
 

Let's not give our young girls any false delusions of grandeur and equality.  There is a reason there has never been a female president. 

Are There No Accountants In The Wizarding World?

What type of a message are we giving to our children when we tell them all about Harry and his pal's time spent in divination and potion classes, but never any time spent in chemistry or calculus.

Believe it or not, our children will not get to live in a world of wizards and witches.  They will have to be in this place we call the real world, and in the real world, management want people with real intelligence.  They don't want some idiot in a cloak with a stick, who thinks 3 * 3 = 47.

Also I feel I should note that regardless of the immorality of it, this is just poor story telling.  How will the children know they are not being ripped off when they buy their books without at least some rudimentary mathematical skills?  Piss poor Mr. Rowling, piss poor.

Are We Honestly Trying To Say Big People Are To Be Trusted

Throughout the series of Harry Potter stories, Harry and his gang of sinners often seek aid from a large oaf by the name of Hagrid.  Hagrid is a half-breed, a cross between a Giant and a human.  This sends a dangerous message to our children, that being that large people are honest people.
Obviously, that is not the case.

Large people are not really people at all.  Anybody over the height of 6' is a freak and probably spends a majority of their time prowling the streets looking for children to kidnap and/or sell crack to.

By teaching our children at this impressionable age that tall people not only are accepted members of our society, but also are fit to breed with, we risk setting a dangerous precedent which could ultimately lead to these tall people being seen as on the same plane as you or I.
  
Shaquille O'Neal is 7'1'' 315 lbs.  He once ordered a custom Motorcycle worth almost $100k be built, then decided he didn't want it, and told the place ""Fuck off, go find a new buyer.""  Because there are so many bike enthusiasts his size with $100k to spend.  Also he was in Kazaam and Steel.  I rest my case.
 
 

Do you want to see that happen?  I sure don't.    

Harry's Not As Think As You Drunk He Is

 
A Look under Harry's Bunk at School
 
 Surely underage drinking in America was never a problem until these past few years.  Countless experts have postulated on what is to blame for this sudden rise over the past 7 or 8 years.
The Answer?  Harry Potter of course.

How can the young readers come away with any impression other than ""Drinking is the coolest!"" after reading these stories.  At every 
 
turn, the main characters can be seen drinking ""Butterbeer.""
Butter.

Beer.

Not only is this advocating underage drinking, it is helping to contribute to the plague of fatness that the evil fast-food restaurants have sought to attack us with.  The blatant use of this tool as means for the characters to relax and have a good time is an utterly irresponsible display my Mr. Rowling, though I really have come to expect as much from this Satan-worshipping fiend.
 

Like, Whoa Harry....Whoa

You would think that it would be enough for Mr. Rowling's evil mind to know he is turning our youth's into alcoholic devil-worshippers, but alas it is not enough to sate his evil heart.

He must also attempt to make cool the concept of smoking.  And, not just smoking, but smoking weed.

Throughout these books the characters of Merry and Pippin can be found smoking ""pipeweed.""

To say that this is a thinly veiled allusion to smoking marijuana is an understatement.  It is common knowledge that Satan himself planted the first marijuana plant, and this is just another one of Mr. Rowling's attempts to turn your children into Jesus hating blood-drinkers.

They're Teenagers You Perv

The last thing any parent wants to think of is the concept of your child becoming sexually active as they grow older.
Unfortunately, that is no longer an option for many, as the concept of perpetual virginity is being erased by these books.

In the latest installment of the series, Ron and his sister Ginny are often said to be snogging, even in public, with their respective partner's.

For those of you who don't know what snogging is, it is a British word which represents an elaborate form of intercourse involving whips, batteries and cross-dressing.

Now, any sane person knows that the act of sexual intercourse is dirty, and should never be partaken in be anyone.  Sadly, due to the corruption of these books, a world where nobody has sex
  
Caught in the act by a teacher, Harry holds Hermione close. (Picture's lower half removed for graphic content.)
 
 
seems like it will never come to be.  Worse, not only will children who read these books one day grow up to be sexually active adults, some may even partake in the lowest form of intercourse, snogging. 

When I Move Here, The Queen Will Take Me

The above is an exact quote from the character of Ron Weasley, expressing that he will now commit an act which will lead to the queen (a term for a homosexual man) taking (a term for having sex with) him, taken from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

Later in the series, in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Gilderoy Lockhart, a male teacher, succeeds in reaching out and firmly grasping Ron's ""wand,"" an obvious euphemism for his genitals.

This institution of a gay character as Harry's best friend is obviously an attempt by Mr. Rowling to turn your child into a gay.

From this I can only conclude that he too is a gay, and is trying to seduce our children.  Clearly his above pictured wife is a cover-up marriage, and she is likely a lesbian.

I am okay with lesbians.

Whatchu Talkin' 'bout Albus?

Children are not equal to adults.  This is not something up for debate, rather a fact.

Why is it then, that Mr. Rowling chooses to have the main character act with so much sass?  Because he wants to corrupt your children so they join him in the eternal fires of hell.

Harry makes a habit of back-talking and acting up during class, failing to show proper respect for his superiors, for that is what they are, even if they are satanic conjurors.

Blatant disrespect is shown throughout the novel to Severus Snape, the most likable character among the evil God-haters in these novels, and this can only lead to impressionable youths thinking it is okay to talk back to adults.  That can only lead to more children being beaten for their insolence, possibly to death should they be too far out of line, and all of those deaths shall rest squarely on Mr. Rowling's shoulders.

Seriously, Witchcraft Is The Work Of The Devil

I cannot stress to you enough that NO magic is good magic.

Everyone who partakes in magic and similar tomfoolery is doing the work of the devil.  THE DEVIL.

Mr. Rowling, in these books, seeks to make your children take up these evil arts so that they too will spend eternity in fire being tormented by Satan and his minions.  While I cannot say why he seeks to do the Devil's work, I would guess it was likely a trade off for the fame these novels have brought him.

Please, help me get these books banned, or your children will not be permitted on the great journey to heaven! 

So When Somebody Returns From The Dead, Kill Them Again?

I am both shocked and appalled that nobody else has made the following obvious conclusion.
VOLDEMORT IS JESUS!!!

That's right.  First he dies, then his followers are persecuted, and now he has risen from the dead to live again.

Now, having made this conclusion we are left with one glaring point: These books call Jesus evil, and then order our children to seek to find and kill him when he rises again.
  
Concept Art for the 7th Potter book, in which Harry sneaks up on Voldemort (center, to be played by James Caviezel) and his ""Death Eaters,"" wand at the ready.
 
 

This blatant hatred for all that is good and holy in this world is an attack on the very beliefs of the American people, that being that Jesus is our Lord and savior.
Every parent who buys these books is literally giving their children a means to learn hatred for our accepted savior.  WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN!?!?!?
 

 

Having now read the above points you are obviously of the only sane opinion there is, that being that these books are pure evil and must be stopped and banned from our great land.  Please sign the petition here and show your support.

I HOPE this is satire!!!!!!!!!!! I'm pretty sure it is, though. That said, I can't WAIT to be a horrible evil person and read the 7th book when it comes out! And I can't help but wonder what the market for young adult fiction will be like once the Harry Potter literary dynasty comes to an end. Do you suppose there will be a space for a new bestseller on so many bookshelves across the world??????? A new bestseller written by...oh, I don't know...me? :-)

But I am pretty excited about the 7th Harry Potter book. It will be kinda sad when it's all over, though... :(   Then again, the ""me being in London when it comes out"" part isn't too bad! :-)"

"event","So...

I've been thinking about the Roman Empire a lot. How big and magnificent it was. How the heck they got their armies through the Alps. How they controlled most of the known Western world at the height of their power and how they persecuted Christians and yet the capital of the Christian world somehow ended up in their city and how their ideas continue to influence art, government, literature, and culture of the entire Western Hemisphere even today. And how I was there less than four weeks ago, and so is their city. In ruins, of course, but it's still there. 

And then it collapsed.

Which I guess goes to show that no matter how powerful things are, how great your life is, how perfect everything is, nothing can last forever. Throughout history, every great empire has lost power, and that's how it will always be. And I can't help but wonder who will be next. Sadly, I'm afraid it might be the United States. I'm not going to turn this into a political rant because I'm incredibly indecisive and I'm still not exactly sure where I stand on a lot of important issues, and my viewpoints that have been solidified are probably incredibly unpopular with my readership...but I will share my end of the world theory if you want.

End of the World Theory:
        Big corporations, overpopulated developing nations, consumerist greed, and the general cult of overindulgent individualism will eventually lead to depletion of our natural resources and a complete breakdown of our natural earth systems. Eventually, it will get to the point where even basic drinking water is a scarce commodity because there is not enough clean H2O for the Earth's 15 billion people. So the 5 Superpowers of the United States, the European Union, India, China, and Japan (The US because it can still hold its own even in decline, the EU because each country by itself can't really do anything, but when they complete the unification that they are already working toward, they can pack a pretty powerful punch, India and China because they both have already enormous populations that are growing exponentially as well as rapidly industrializing economies, and Japan because it is an overpopulated technological wonder) invade Antarctica and fight a devastating global war over it. Because Antarctica is basically a giant ice cube currently unclaimed by any territory. 

Okay, I'm not really a cynical person. I'm just a history nerd. As I realized in Europe. Almost everyone else in our class got excited over shopping, bars, boys, wine, shopping, bars, boys, wine, blah blah blah. I got excited because our hotel in Rome was on Cavour Street and I knew that Cavour was one of the revolutionary leaders who unified Italy in the 1800s. And then when we were in Venice, I was sitting on the roof garden overlooking the Adriatic Sea one morning enjoying the sunshine and writing in my journal, and this girl comes up to me and tells me that I should put my journal away and enjoy myself. To that, I replied that I enjoy writing in my journal, and she just had this totally confuzzled expression, as if she couldn't possibly CONCEIVE that someone would actually ENJOY writing in their journal. But for me, writing is a form of expression as well as escape, a way for me to simultaneously create my own world or document reality as I see it. Oh well, that's just me and I'm okay with that. I like myself, and my friends like me, and my family likes me, and my boyfriend likes me, and so who really cares what they think. 

They were nice people, really, even if they did spend three weeks stumbling about in a drunken stupor. Seriously, though, I met a lot of cool people who I probably wouldn't have talked to otherwise. And I took soooooo many pictures-about 900 to be exact! If you know me at all, you're probably not too surprised. ;) But I got about half of them developed for my scrapbook, and you'd think that after I spent $90 on photo-developing, Walgreens would be kind enough to put them in chronological order for me...but nooooooooooooo! Argh! This scrapbook is going to be QUITE the project...but an enjoyable one, nonetheless. 

And then in a little over a month, I will have several hundred MORE Europe pictures! Because it's one thing to hypothetically say ""I'm going back there sometime"" and quite another thing to actually have tickets and prearranged booking on a tour that leaves on July 8! :) Yay!

Okay, time to go read Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell for a little while and then I have to go to sleep so I can get up for work tomorrow...whoop de doo! Today I got to proofread a lot, though, which is always fun, especially when what you're proofreading has been written by engineers. ;) Brilliant people, but they can't write! Oh well, maybe I shouldn't criticize because I definitely couldn't do their job. And I need the money to pay my massive photography bills..."

"event","You go to your little sister's high school performance of West Side Story and find yourself sitting directly in front of your old Sunday School teacher, whom you haven't seen since 6th grade, and your conversation goes something like this:

Old Sunday School Teacher: So, how is college
Me: Pretty good...I'm liking it so far...
OSST: So, what are you studying? English?
Me: Actually, yes!
OSST: I always knew you'd end up reading and writing

Keep in mind that I haven't seen or had any contact with this woman in 8 years.

And then the musical starts and so I sit back and enjoy Bernstein. Until I start analyzing the literary qualities of West Side Story and scrutinizing the parallels between WSS and Romeo and Juliet. And not just the superficial ones.

And then I start trying to fit the experiences of the characters in WSS into the New Paradigm of U.S. Immigration History and analyze it in the context of Second Wave Immigration to New York.

And WHY did I not realize that I was destined to study English instead of bio?

And then we all go out to dinner afterward and my sister's fourteen-year old best friend starts describing her plan for world peace and Third World development, and I start arguing that her plan would actually be worse because it would throw supply-and-demand out of whack and ruin the economies that it was designed to help.

She's fourteen.

I would like to think I'm pretty social, but I do have a quiet side, so maybe it makes sense...I don't know.

"event","AAAAAAHHH! I feel sooooo much better now!

Well, not physically, because I'm still all stuffy and allergenic, but mentally, I feel a LOT better now that I turned in my most recent story and took my Religions test yesterday and did my history presentation. I almost didn't get out of bed, but I realized that if I didn't, my GPA would die a slow and painful death considering that all my classes today involved massive, grade-altering events. But I think it went well! My history teacher liked my presentation so much that she told me I should present it at the Women's Studies conference next year, which made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. :)

And then I took a 2-1/2 hour nap, which felt soooooooooo good! Except I had this really whacked out dream where I was in some field in Austria with all of my friends and a tour group filled with old people, and then this bull came and started nuzzling me with its nose. I then looked up and saw some moderately-attractive guy in his late 20s, and I tried to speak to him, but he spoke only German, so THAT didn't go over too well, and then the bull started dancing with me in a way that kind of resembled a tango. It was then that everyone else started clapping, and I realized that I was the entertainment that they were all sitting around waiting for. And lots and lots of pictures were taken...

Is this an example of foreshadowing???? 

Or maybe I'm just going crazy. Dr. B asked me if I was stoned today. Slightly awkward since I DEFINITELY don't do pot, or any other kinds of drugs. Except perhaps Walitin. :)

Oh yes, and I have had the Numa Numa song stuck in my head for the past 4 days. Too bad I don't understand Romanian.

Well, at least the first draft of it. Which is probably absolutely awful, considering that I wrote most of it after 11:00 pm tonight. Technically, it's not due until Tuesday, but finishing it now allows me to get a second opinion on it.

I think it has potential, but some parts have the tendency to drag a bit, and so I should probably cut out the boring parts. I'm also trying to write from the first-person male perspective, which is something I've never done before, so that made this story a bit more challenging that others. I'm used to little kid perspective and female perspective, but I thought this story would be more interesting if told from the p.o.v. of a male character. I tried writing it in third-person omniscient originally, but it was sooooooooo boooooooooooring! 

Hopefully it's not boring anymore! 

Otherwise, life is fantastic! :) :) :) If you know me at all, you'll know why! ;)

21 days!!!!!!!"

"event","WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CAFFEINE HIGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

English majors on caffeine high=most efficient paper writers ever! 5 religion papers written in 3 hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FINALLY!!!! NO MORE PROJECTS DUE...this week, at least...ugh. Next week should be okay, and then I enter into academic purgatory...ugh...but I don't want to think about that right now...

I'm just glad I got my religion project done! I probably should have started it before 9 pm the night before it was due-after all, I usually don't procrastinate this much, but in all fairness, I had two history projects due this week (one on Tuesday and one on Thursday). I guess I should have worked on it more today, but I was in class until 4 and then I had jazz sectionals and then I had a fiction paper to write and then I went to Walgreens and then I went to dinner and then I dyed Easter eggs and then I spent quite a bit of time...ummm...socializing...and then I got a cup of coffee, and then I sat down to write the religion papers and I am still bouncing off the wall!!!!!!!!!! *bounce bounce bounce* That's what I get trying to order coffee after 9 pm...I wonder if sleeping tonight is going to actually happen...

Or maybe it's not the caffeine that's making me so loopy. Maybe it's just life in general. After much stress, it looks like things will be okay. I got all the classes that I want for next semester with no problem, and my housing dilemma seems to be resolved as well, and as for my social life...hehe, that's another story for another time! ;) Oh yeah, and 34 days until Europe!!!!!! :) :) :) Ooooh, and my fiction professor is still talking about how much he liked my last story, and I have a really good idea for my next one, as long as I can avoid romance genre on one side and political satire on the other. Nothing against political satire, but I just don't think I know enough about politics to write an intelligent commentary. 

Anywho, I should probably go to bed, but I'm afraid I'll just launch myself out of bed and break through the ceiling and then fall back and bounce up and down like a giant bouncing ball...or else I'll just have some really, really weird dreams...I don't know...

"event","""Somehow you manage to pull off 2 things: 1. Allow a caracature of a cliched tale and its personalities; 2. manage a kind of fantasy romance in postmodern fashion. So a fine job. There's little to criticize-good control, writing excellent. It would be good to see you take on more real, less serendipitous tales, though-to see what a different treatment would do.""
-My fiction teacher's reaction to my last short story. :)

Well, I think he missed the point on a few things. Like how I don't like postmodernism and I really don't want to write deep heavy issue-stories. What's wrong with a historical fantasy-romance anyway? Our class had quite an interesting discussion today about dangerous space in fiction and why certain topics are considered ""taboo."" But I'll probably elaborate on that in a later post.

Nevertheless, this gave me a much-needed ego boost! And a lot of the other things that have been weighing me down lately seem to have been resolved! :)

And by the way, why is the roommate finding process so similar to the dating process???"

"event","Last night, I dreamed that our university was inside a castle (kind of like Hogwarts) and Ambassador's Club was hosting a masquerade ball for all the prospective students. As an Ambassador, I was required to attend this ball dressed up like an angel. Only I couldn't find a costume, so by the time I finally got my costume around, I was ridiculously late. 

As I sneak in late, I suddenly remember that I'm supposed to be playing in Titan Band, so I'm running around trying to find Titan Band before the Ambassador's Club people find me.

But that's not the weird part yet...

Because then, I feel a tap on my shoulder, and I turn around to find Hillary Clinton standing there wanting to talk to me. Apparently Hillary Clinton has a son who is considering attending my school next year. And Hillary wants me to sit at their dinner table and tell her son about all the good things our school has to offer. Now, I'm not a huge Hillary fan, but at the same time, you can't just say NO to her! 

So I sit down at the table and start talking. Meanwhile, both Titan Band and Ambassador's Club have sent out search parties trying to find me, so I keep having to duck under the table as Hillary is giving me strange looks from across our plate of fettucine alfredo. Which doesn't work so well when you're wearing cardboard angel wings...



Just thought y'all would like to know about that dream. In case you really care. Or in case you have dream analysis skills..."

"event","Hmmmm...I definitely haven't been reading as much as I wanted to this break. I finally finished Brunelleschi's Dome about how they built a giant dome for a cathedral in 15th century Florencce, which was kind of interesting, yet at the same time, very homework-y...

And I just started reading ""A World Of Its Own: Race, Labor, and Citrus in the Making of Greater Los Angeles"" by Matt Garcia. Sounds enthralling, huh? It's not. I fell asleep (quite literally) during the first chapter, and by some miracle, I've managed to read the second chapter without shooting myself...yet! 

I really wish that my teachers didn't assign so much homework over spring break so that I could read something that I actually WANT to read for a change! That's the thing about being an English major with a history minor. You spend all your time reading, but it is never anything you choose, so when you finally have free time at school, you want to do anything in the world BUT read! That's why breaks are so nice-they give you a chance to pleasure-read.

Let's see. What would I be reading if I didn't have to read stuff for class...hmmm...

Probably some Shakespeare-maybe The Merchant of Venice or The Taming of the Shrew?
Chronicles of Narnia-ONE MORE CHRONICLE TO GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell-Sarah recommended it, and I bought it a LONG time ago, but never got past the first chapter because I've been SOOOO busy!
Peace Like A River- The pastor from IV told me to read it because he thinks I can relate. Sounds interesting.

And my mom has a big pile of books for me to read too, but alas...instead, I get to read about the economics of citrus...fun fun fun! :(

But seriously...I actually watched 2 hours of TV the other day! For me, that is almost embarassing! At least it was a Travel Channel special about Rome, Florence, and Venice, so it was educational...yeah, I'm a dork like that! :)

But now I need to go to bed because I have a dentist appointment tomorrow-bleck! :( :( :("

Lo and behold, this person is a guy from my dorm who I am kind of friendly with, so I inquired why he was on crutches. 

Apparently, he broke his foot trying to play football. Ouch!

My response?

""Oh wow! I'm sorry to hear that! Well, if I don't see you again, have a nice break!"" Because, of course, spring vacation starts tomorrow.

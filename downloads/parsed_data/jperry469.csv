"event","Well I had a pretty good day with work, I'm tired I don't know why I went to bed earlier than I have in a while. Kat, I guess needed a day to herself, thats not the part that has me mad. I'm mad cause the last thing she said was to call her at 10 am. She didn't pick up, which ok she needs a day to herself everyone does (even though she got mad at me when I tried it), but just say that instead of telling me to call then not picking up. I didn't get worried until people started calling looking for her, cause noone knew where she was and it isn't like her not to answer her phone. I wasn't even mad then I got mad when she finally picked up the phone and acted like she didn't even care that we were all worried, that I was worried. I know she needs alone time to think, especially after we got closer last night. At least, I did I never know about her. All I do know is I like how she felt in my arms. Maybe she'll call tonight I don't know I just hope she knows how scared I was when we couldn't find her"

"event","Well another day over I am so tired between not sleeping much and the emotional strain I'm under right now I am comepletely exhausted. I understand where Kat is coming from, from our talk last night, but I still don't like it. At least she talked to me, and we discussed everything unlike with someone else who still never has talked to me. That is one of the reasons I choose Kat over anyone else. She is cold to me now like she has no feeling whatsoever, I don't know if it's an act trying not to show me she cares anymore, or if she really doesn't want to act the way we have been. She even did everything for herself, and didn't make me get up from her favorite chair. I thought that I didn't really like doing everything she said, now I know that I hate her not having me do things for her even more. I don't know if she'll even call me tonight, I hope so I like staying up til dawn talking to her :), and will miss it if we stop. She told me that her feelings for me are more sexual than emotional. Maybe we should just be sex friends for now then o:) I think I could handle that if she wanted to. Wanted to tell her that today, but she seems totally not interested in anything to do with me. I figure I want her, she wants me so why not? It might be fun I never have had that before maybe I just need to get laid to, if nothing else would relieve my stress."

"event","I was having a good day til about 4:30. Kat always acts different towards me when Trevor or Jes are around. I don't understand it. She treats me like gold when were alone or talking on the phone, but is so mean to me when they are around. I wish I knew y. We went out tonight after work with Jes to the boardwalk which was a complete waiste of time, the boardwalk is closed in the winter. Then Kat talked to Mike on the phone and was talking about him coming down here and stuff. Doesn't she know how much that hurts me? Does she even care that it does? I don't know, all I do know is that I can't keep living on the fence like this. She needs to decide she is going to be with me or not. Fuck everyone else!!!!!!!!!! I won't keep living like this it hurts me to much. If she won't be with me I have to end it, we both already have tried, but this is it I need to end it now or be hurt again. Well on my 4th beer now since I been home only 11 more to go! Fuck it!"

"event","Well I got some sleep finally. Have to go to work tomorrow and drive, it's supposed to be my day off, but I need the money I want to do a couple of things on my vacation and need money to do them. Work was ok today, Jess came up with her boy Cody. I used to really like her now I'm just glad shes a good friend of mine. I just don't want to see her hurt anymore. I hope Kat understands I just want Jess' friendship now. Kat, seemed upset at me at work tonight when we first got there. Jes, said we just need a break to rest and everything would be ok. Maybe she's right I just hate when Kat's mad at me, and I really don't want to take a break from talking to her, who cares about sleep anyway. Well have to go-bye"

"event","After work, I went out with Kat. We went to Daytona and drove around went to a few stores, and she didn't even ask me to hold her purse! Of course we ate a Mcdonalds (why always Mcdonalds). Any way I just wish she would listen to that song she likes so much now, the Mario song I forget the name, but I think the title describes it all. Anyway talk to you later nite"

"event","Well, it's been a crazy, weird, and sometimes downright shitty past week and a couple days. Big events that were cool, hanging with Chris, playing videogames with Gary, a Bears win over the Jets and a nice Thanksgiving dinner. The really bad stuff is pretty bad. Chikotra passed away on the 19th, which is really sad and still wierd getting used to not having her cage in the corner of my room. Other bad happenings, Chicago lost to New England and I didn't get to go to the Bury Your Dead/ All That Remains/ Killswith Engage show. How shitty is that? Oh yeah, I had to deal with my parents thinking I had a drinking problem. So yeah. There was more bad than I usually like to have in my life. I'm still in pretty good spirits all things considered so yeah, we'll see where we go from here."

"event","The answer to that question is NO! I'm in a chipper mood right now, to say the least. Animating a kitty is fun and listening to some Strapping Young Lad is always a good thing. I wasn't in a good mood earlier though. Yeah, my scholarship people at the Men's Wearhouse done called and said that they never got a transcript so they can't send me my money for school until they get one. I done orderd a transcript back in the spring so I went to talk with the fine people at Records and they told me that they had indeed sent it and that it probably got lost in the mail. So I had to reorder another transcript which is going to take about 2 weeks to get there, so once that gets there, I'll have to wait about 2 weeks for the scholarship stuff to come in so I'm looking at about a month before it gets in. Good news is that I did a good enough job of saving up my summer earnings so that I'll be able to live and have fun, it'll just be a little while until Evergreen gets paid for housing. And I did manage to adjust my housing payments so that there will be no late fees, so yay for that. So after all the hassle and worry, I'm in a good spot now and know that stuff's taken care of. 

In other news, the Godsmack and Rob Zombie show was a lot of fun. Alonna and I managed to get up front on the lawn barrier so we could actually see the stage. Amazing yes. Shinedown was the first band, and they were all right. They had one song that I liked a lot and the rest was just kind of there. Rob Zombie was awesome. The musical quality was hit and miss but man he can put on a show. There were a bunch of video screens showing some pretty cool animations and a lot of fire! So that was cool for sure. Godsmack was fun enough. They decided to do some extended versions of some of thier songs which kinda bogged them down and was boring in parts. They also repeated the drum duel that they did when I saw them with Metallica. I would have rather gotten to hear more songs instead. Still had a good time, but Rob definitely was the highlight of the night. There were some issues after the show about meeting up with some people that put a damper on the evening, but overall it was a good night. 

This weekend should be cool, specifically because the Bears play the Seahawks and are gonna beat the crap out of them. I'm gonna go to Dad's and watch the game with him, just gotta hope that he won't be driving angry after the game. So yeah, that's what up and down and all around yo! Hope everyone else is having a good time."

"event","Um yeah, things have been pretty good this past week, sans the Chikotra discovery. Friday was my last day at Shell and it went by pretty smooth. Saturday saw me hanging with Aunt Donna and Armando all day, which was fun. We just hung out in downtown Seattle, saw ""The Covenant"" which was just kinda there, and overall had a good time. On Sunday, I went back downtown, visited Aunt Donna at her work in Pike's Place Market, was unable to buy peanuts from Alonna, saw ""Little Miss Sunshine"" which is probably the best movie of the year, and watched the scores during other football games to see that the Bears shut out the Packers 26-0! I can't wait to watch the tape that Mom recorded for me. Monday saw me chillin' with Gary Joe all day which was nice. Yesterday, I got the new Papa Roach CD which starts out good, but goes softer towards the middle and stays that way. Yeah, dissapointing, but it's what I expected. I also got to go and play some poker with Gary's friends. Everyone started out with $5.00 in chips, and at one point, I was down to $0.30 in chips. In one of my better performances, I turned that $0.30 into $18.75 by the time it was time to cash out because everyone was tired, except for me. I wanted to keep playing! But yeah, that was fun. Tonight is gonna be great, as I'm gonna go see All That Remains and Dragonforce! Fun fun fun indeed. Well, I'm looking forward to Saturday when I can move back into the dorms and then school will be back in session a week after, so yeah, things are about to get rolling right along. Good times."

"event","So let's see where to begin. I guess we'll just go with Thursday night when I stayed up until 5 am waiting for T$ to pick me up. Yeah, he was gonna pick me up after he got done working the Def Leopard and Journey concert and he got stuck at the venue, so that's why it was so late. Mind you I had been up since 5 am cause I had worked that day and only got a 1 hour nap in. It was fun though because we were able to go to Shari's and get some breakfast. I also got to meet two new cool people, Zach and Morgan, so that's cool. We didn't get to the Swamp Castle until 7 am and wound up sleeping until 2 pm. 

So now we're on Friday. We all went into town to run some erands and such to kill time before the Terror-Dactyls show. Oh yeah, T$ and M also dragged us out to Tumwater falls so they could practice. It was kinda like that show Music in High Places only better and not so corny. The show itself was all right. The Terror-Dactyls were fun but the other acts were just kinda like ehh. After the show we went back to T's and drank while watching D3 The Mighty Ducks. Let's just say that I was my usual drunk self. When the Ducks won, I cheered as if the Bears had won the Superbowl or something. So yeah, that's funny.

Saturday saw me winding back up in Tacoma. The rest of the weekend has just kinda been chilling, playing video games, and listening to a bunch of music because it's just Farron and me here. The rest of the family went to Shelton to visit Char's friend. I did get new shoes because mine started getting holes in them. The new ones were normally $50 but I got them for $18 so that was cool. I also got a Godsmack-Rob Zombie ticket for their concert on the 27th, so I'm for sure going to that now, which should be fun.

Looking to the future, I'm entering my last 4 days of work at ARS 115, also known as the Mercer Island Shell. I'm gonna be up in Seattle next week, from the 8th to the 14th visiting Gary and going to the Dragonforce show, which should be awesome. So yay for that!

I guess I've got 12 days until it's time to get back to Evergreen which is exciting, yet scary too. I'm still freakin' out over how fast college has gone by. I can't believe that I'm gonna be graduating in about 9 months. Crazy. Anywho, I'm psyched about getting to live with some cool roommates and getting back into the swing of things so yeah, that should be fun."

"event","To prove to everyone just how good of a person I really am, I will inform you that I have given another man the shirt off of my back. At work last Friday, a new guy was there on his first day of the job and he didn't have an official red Shell shirt to wear. Being the nice guy that I am, I gave him mine and proceeded to wear my jacket with no shirt on underneath for the rest of my shift. Very uncomfortable. Okay, I'll admit that my boss asked me to do it and my shift only had about an hour left. Still, if that's not an example of self-sacrifice, I don't know what is. Of course, this had to come on the same day I put in my two-weeks notice, so maybe Farron's getting back at me or something.

Saturday night saw the return of ""Drunk Chris"" albeit in a more contained form. I was watching football and drinking beer. Then I watched wrestling. Probably the least eventful of my drunken adventures, but hey, it was more fun than being sober on that night. Not that I have anything against being sober, because there are many times where things are more fun without being under the influence. 

Past couple days, I've just been working, less hours than usual too. A combined 11 over two days. By the way, when writing, any double digit numbers, such as 44 or 16 are to be in numerical form whereas single digit numbers like six and eight are to be spelled out, so that's why I done did it that way! Random lesson aside, it's been less stressful at work and more fun. Guess that's what happens when co-workers actually work for a change! 

So yeah, not too much else is up lately. Just chillin' with a four day weekend coming up and looking forward to visiting my brother in Seattle in a week and a half, which will also be the end of my working. Hmmm, coincidence? Nope, that was by design. See, I can think things out and make plans that will be feasible. So yay for that! And that's all I got for you, so yay for that too!

Um, I'll try to be more consistant with postings too."

 I'm a working man now. 
Current mood:  tired 


I should start off by saying that at this moment, I've got the cutest little kitten in front of me laying in the window sill puring her brains out. That being said, we'll continue on.

Well, the past week has been fun in some parts and completely tiring in others. The big news is that I am now working, and the place is a Shell gas station on Mercer Island. I worked 30 hours in 3 days this past week, one of them being a 12 hour day, so that certainly wore me out. My job duties include stocking and cleaning the store and running the register when the other guys aren't there. The sucky part is that I have to be up by 5:00 am in order to get to work on time. But I'll get used to it as time goes on.

The 4th of July was really fun! I got to go up to Lake Stevens for a BBQ and fireworks. Nik and I found an old toy that we had actually been saving up for a few years to blow up and I must say that this year's destruction ranks up there with some of the best. We actually managed to get the toy to melt into two pieces, so that was fun. There were so many fireworks being shot off in Grandma's neighborhood that we couldn't see the end of the street due to all the smoke. It was fun!

This weekend has been one of rest. I'm chillin' at my mom's place and we're going to go see Pirates of the Carribeian 2 later on today, so that will be fun. Other than that, not too much else is up right now, so that's all there will be to report. Later.

 Drunk in public 
Current mood:  happy 


Saturday night was a good night, although certainly not the smartest night for yours truly. Farron and I went to go see some local bands at Hell's Kitchen and we wound up unleashing the beast that it ""Drunk Chris"" on the innocent bystanders. I had a great time rocking out, moshing, and generally headbanging all over the place as well as dishing out as many high fives as humanly possible. The 2 bands that I saw the whole thing of were De-Krep-It and Severus and both were really good so that was a good night for sure.

Other events of the week included working 4 days, watching Groundhog Day with Kirby, doing a whole lot of nothing with Matt, and watching the greatness that is Keanu Reeves in Point Break! So overall, an average week with some goodness thrown in, such as the concert as well as 3 new CDs and some wrestling tonight. So yay for that!
 
Hey Yo, I've Got Bronchitis!! 
Current mood:  sick 


Yep, it's true, everyone's favorite gas station employee done has bronchitis. I've been coughing like crazy for the past 3 1/2 weeks and finally went to the doctor yesterday. They done gave me some antibiotics and a cough syrup with vicodin in it, so yay for that! It done cost me $35 for the medicine though because my insurence card that I had actually expired a year and a half ago. My parents forgot to tell me that we switched insurences, so no yay for that one. Oh well, I'm feeling better with the medicince, so I guess it was worth it. 

The past couple of weeks have just kind of been there. I've worked, I visited Oly, and I've watched some movies. Not much else is up. I will be working some overtime this upcoming week, so that will probably not be fun, but it'll make next weekend all the more better which is already gonna be a good one because I'll get to see.......THE KITTIES!!!! So yeah, just gotta get through this next week, get over my bronchitis with the medicines, and be free and clear next weekend and there after. Actually, I'll still be working, but just a regular schedule. And now I'm just babbling, so I'm gonna stop now. Okay.

 For some odd reason, I'm not working right now. 

No no no, I'm not fired or anything, it's just that I'm supposed to be working in Tacoma today helping train Tesoro employees on the Shell system since we're taking them over. Apparently there are issues with the big wigs to where we aren't authorized to do any of that right now. What this means is that Farron and I are just chilling in Tacoma, at my dad's no less, watching movies and playing video games instead of working. Hey, I'm still getting $60 for yesterday and at least $30 for today, even though I've done absolutely nothing. I would like to actually work though, cause I get bored just sitting around and our store could actually use a lot of work in the cooler right now and I'm not there to do it. Oh well, stuff I don't have control over. Hope everyone's doing well.

 El Reporto de el fin de semana (Ha that's three years of Spanish for you!) 


Umm, let's see, this past week type thing has been full of good things and bad things. I prefer when there's more of the first one, and I guess this week could qualify. The only real bad thing is that I'm still freakin' sick. I think my meds have taken care of the bronchitis, but now I've got another bug and am running a slight fever and getting headaches like crazy. So yeah, that sucks. It could be worse, I could be dying, but that doesn't appear to be the case so we'll call that good. 

Now for the good stuff. I done got to see the kitties and Twist done purred. Little Miss Nebs hissed even before I touched her, so she wasn't too happy to see me. Oh well, it's what is to be expected from the grey one. I also got to see Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby which was funny but was not better than Anchorman no matter what the critics say. Also, on September 13th, I'm gonna go see me some Dragonforce and All That Remains and get this, Gary's gonna be with me! That should be fun taking my brother to a good ol' metal show. I'm hoping to make it to a couple shows coming up at Hell's Kitchen these next two weekends as well. I'll definitely be at the School Yard Heroes show Aug. 20, not so sure about Asesino and Severus yet for this next weekend. I will be getting to see Gary Joe and going to the zoo this weekend though, so if I don't make it to the show, it certainly won't be the end of the world.

And in a crazy, hilarious turn of events, I done wound up in R Dorm agian, this time R208. So now I will have experienced living on all 3 floors of R, which is just funny to me. Looking forward to starting school agian and get back to doing what I do with the animation stuff. Well, that's about it folks. Adios (more Spanish for you there!)

 ""I've had it with these motherfu*king snakes on this motherfu*king plane!"" and other happenings 
Current mood:  hopeful 


Um, by the title you should probably be able to guess that I went and saw Snakes on a Plane today and indeed I did. It was a funny movie, not becuase it was bad, but because it really was funny. I mean there really was no character development or great acting (Sam Jackson aside) but it was just a fun movie. I went in expecting to see people get bit by snakes and to hear Sam Jackson cuss a lot and I got both so it was worth it. 

On the sickness front, I am getting better slowly but surely. The bronchitis is fully gone, the flu is gone and now I'm just dealing with a sore throat, but that's improving too. I'm just ready to get over all this stuff cause I've felt like a junkie with all the medicines I've been taking. From the vicodin to the inhaler to way too much asprin I'm just ready to be done with the drugs. Not to mention that they are expensive. I've probably spent close to $100 on medicines the past month, just crazy. I am on the upswing so things are looking up so yay for that!

Work has been all right. I worked the register for the most part this week instead of stocking and cleaning the whole time. I get really tired though and am happy to be done by the time my shift is over. Just have 3 weeks left before I quit to go back to school. 

Tomorrow should be fun as I'm going to get to go see the Schoolyard Heroes at Hell's Kitchen with some homies. Probably going to go out to dinner too. Whoa to that! It shall be grand, great, and jolly good to get out of the house and hang with some friends for the first time in about a month. So yes, my spirits are up and I'm finally begining to feel like myself agian. Good for sure. Right? Right! Wrong? No! So there you go.
 
So there's that there update, you should be caught up now, yay for that!"

"event","Well, yesterday was Ozzfest, and I've got to say that it was definitely one of the best days I've ever had. Let's just say that for 11 of the 13 1/2 hours I was there, I was in the pit, pretty much front and center. It was great and I had a blast. I didn't really get to hang out with either of my friends who were also there so that's the only real bummer but I did make contact with both T$ and Alonna, so that was cool. So I guess it's time for the band by band breakdown.

Bad Acid Trip- The first band of the day and I missed most of thier set because I was waiting in the line. Oh well, they were one of the bands I wasn't too amped on seeing anyways. 

A Life Once Lost- These guys were fun. Thier CD is solid and thier set was solid, just not spectacular. Their best song was ""Vulture.""

All That Remains- These guys were the second stage band that I was most looking forward to seeing that I hadn't already seen before and they delivered. They played ""Focus Shall Not Fail,"" ""The Weak Willed,"" ""Tattered on My Sleave,"" and ""This Darkened Heart."" It was a great set and I'm very glad I got to see them finally. I ran into thier lead singer later on in the day and got to shake his hand, so that was cool.

The Red Chord- Here was another fun band. They were a lot better live than on CD because like A Life Once Lost, thier CD is solid, but thier show was great. Thier singer had a boatload of charisma and the band delievered a high energy set.

Strapping Young Lad- These guys are a great silly metal band from BC. They played ""You Suck"" which is the song I really wanted them to play so that was awesome. It was a fun set for sure.

Between the Buried and Me- These guys only got to play three songs since thier songs are so long, but they played the three best songs off of thier CD so that was great. I'm especially happy that I got to hear ""All Bodies"" live.

Wall of Jericho- This was probably the best set of the day by a band I wasn't familar with. They delivered a brutal set and thier singer did a good job keeping the crowd pumped up.

Full Blown Chaos- They were fun enough, but they're just a standard hardcore band from New York so it was nothing special.

Norma Jean- Ehh. They were just kinda there. I've sat through them before and I did it again. There was mostly indifference on my part.

Bleeding Through- These guys put on probably the best 2nd stage show of the day. Last time I saw them I had to back out of the pit due to crowdsurfers being dropped on my head but this time I managed to stay for the whole set, crowdsurfers be damned. They played a lot of stuff off of The Truth but when they played stuff from This is Love, This is Murderous they picked good songs. Highlights were ""Love Lost in a Hail of Gunfire"" and ""Kill to Believe.""

Unearth- This was my third time seeing these guys and it was just as good as the two previous. Actually, it was better because they played some new stuff too. 

Atreyu- Fourth time seeing these guys so I knew what to expect. They did a good job picking which songs they played off of thier newest CD because a lot of those songs wouldn't work on Ozzfest. So they were certainly fun and it was good to get to see them again.

BLS- I skipped them for the 3rd year in a row. I got pizza and water instead and made my way to the pit for mainstage.

Dragonforce- These guys opened the mainstage and it was obvious that they were all about the fun. Their style is reminisant of 80's metal because of the pure speed they play with and also the vocalist's singing style. They were pretty silly but you could tell they were having a good time and that in turn led to the crowd having a good time.

Lacuna Coil- This was my favorite set of the day mostly due to the fact that they suprised me and played ""What I See"" which was awesome. It was just fun to get to see them agian.

Hatebreed- These guys were fun but the real story here was that those of us in the pit managed to break the barrier. Oops. Hatebreed finished thier set with the concert crew holding the barrier up using leverage and then we had to take a 30 minute break so that the barrier could be fixed.

Avenged Sevenfold- They were just there. I really don't have much to say about them. They were one of the bands that I wasn't in the pit for.

Disturbed- Yep, this was the third time seeing these guys too. They pretty much delivered what I expected them to. A fun show with few frills. They played all thier hits but also threw in ""Diefy"" which was suprising. 

System of a Down- These guys were amazing. I'm glad I got to see them before they go on hiatus. The first half of thier set was dedicated to stuff off of ""Mesmerize/Hypnotize"" and the second half was dedicated to thier older stuff. The best songs were ""Violent Pornography,"" ""War,"" ""Chop Suey,"" and ""Sugar."" They were full of energy and just silly, often changing the words to the songs just to be even more vulgar. 

Ozzy- I left the pit before Ozzy started because I was just dog tired at that point. I spent Ozzy's set watching from the back. It was fun, but I think that I like watching Black Sabbath better.

So there's the report. I would say that it was definitely the best Ozzfest I've ever been to, probably the best concert I've been to. It was amazing to be in the pit for most of the show, I'm suprised I made it. But I guess with the right amounts of determination and adreniline anything is possible. It was a great day."

Um, beyond that, these past couple days have been allright. Just been hanging out, playing Madden, and watching movies. I done watched Hoodwinked and Kiss the Girls yesterday. Both were all right, nothing special though. I also got to hang out with Mr. Matt Smith, playing some basketball and that good stuff. Only problem is I jammed my middle and ring fingers on my right hand, so those aren't feeling too hot right now. Oh well, no pain no gain, right? I had a lot of fun, so it was worth it. Today is just kinda chillin' again, might go hang out with Matt again. So yeah, that's about it.

Pretty much, the boss man is flaking out on me because I can't work Graveyard and that's where he needs people to work. Geez, so yeah, I'm not in the best of moods right now. Hopefully something is figured out or else I'm probably headed back to Rochester early this summer. 

The only thing of note is that Saturday I got to go to my first 21 and over concert. It was at Hell's Kitchen and it was fun. The bands that played were Violence Unleashed, Hatefist, Burnt Shadows, and Lahar. Violence Unleashed and Burnt Shadows were both great while the other two were fun but nothing special. So that was fun. 

Ozzfest is getting closer, just 10 days away now. I just really want this whole job thing to work out. I guess what happens happens, right? Oh well."

Well, the eval stuff is done, and yours truly got all 16 credits, meaning only 4 more are needed to graduate but I'm going to be an overachiever and go for 48 more! Actually though, evals went fine, I got a good one overall and Ruth gave me a bunch of suggestions for what I can work on this summer to make sure I can be succesful next year so that's a good thing. As far as the cleaning front is concerned, well that's just gonna happen when it happens. I'll probably do some work on the kitchen tonight, but there really is no pressure since I've got all day tomorrow too. 

In other news, I done got to hang out Tyrel last night at the swamp castle. It was a blast. We made a bonfire down at the beach and actually went into the Puget Sound in survival suits. It was amazing to get to go swimming without getting wet! It really wasn't swimming because there was only 2 feet of water or so, but we got to float and stuff, so it was fun for sure. We also watched the show Home Movies which was funny. So yeah, it was great fun to get to hang with my #1 homie! 

So just 2 days until Faja picks me up and takes me to Tacoma for the summer. And just 14 days until what is sure to be the best day of the year...OZZFEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

After that, Chris and I watched Austin Powers in Goldmember and then we watched Eurotrip. What fueled this MASSIVE movie night? It's a little thing called scotch. So yeah, I felt good last night. Unfortunately, I didn't drink enough water, so I've had a headache going since I woke up, but the good thing is that it's starting to subside as I'm already on my 3rd bottle of water in an hour, so yay for hydration! 

Coming up this weekend is my sister's graduation from high school. Some family is coming to visit as is Gary Joe, so that should be a good time. The kitten will purr and all will be good. 

Next week will be cleaning week. R308 is gonna be sparkling by the time we're done with it. And next Saturday marks my exit from Evergreen for the summer. Fear not, I'll be back in the fall, although for the last time. So whoa to that as well!

"event","Like usual, I'm ending the day on a happy, probably crazy note. I'm just going to preface what I'm about to recount with the fact that I am a dude. Knowing that, it'll probably explain things. So Kirby and I were watching the ECW vs. WWE special tonight and saw a flimsy street sign used as a weapon. Kirby complained that that would do nothing. Upon hearing this, I remembered that I have a flimsy ""No Parking"" sign above the toilet. This led to the idea that we should test whether or not being hit over the head with a thin sheet metal sign would actually do anything. Kirby swang and all it did was make a loud noise. The impact really didn't hurt at all. I gave Kirby a hit and he has similar results. Things then escalated from there, as we took out my wallet chain and started swinging that thing at each other. That did hurt a little more, but in all actuality, it looks a lot more painful than it really is. Now if we swung at full strength, that'd hurt for sure! Anywho, it sounds like Kirby and I are going to have ourselves a little hardcore match sometime in the near future. So yeah, that's what watching wrestling does to you kids! 

In other news, today was the last day of class. We watched everybody's animations again, which was fun and a nice way to end it all. ""The Artist"" didn't get a great response but everybody laughed out loud watching ""It's More Than PC, It's PCP!"" so that was cool. Just got to write an evaluation draft before 5:00 pm tomorrow, but that won't be so hard. 

I also made my way to Lacey to the Washington Department of Licensing in order to get an ID card. The bus ride over was interesting as there was a crazy old dude talking about how he had called the White House and told them to get ready for him because he was running for President in 2008. He said it cost $1.00 for ten minutes to call over there and went on to say that 2008 was a lock because he almost won in 2004. He then tried passing out cards with his name on it so that we could all remember to vote for him. That was pretty funny. Once I got to the DOL, the process of waiting and getting the ID took about an hour. Luckily they only wanted the expired permit and I didn't have to dig out 5 forms of alternate identification documents. So my official ID is in the mail and will show up in 3 weeks. Then I can buy booze, although that won't be a common occurance. I might be able to do so now but I don't know how the rules work with a temporary ID. The process was a little less painless than I thought it would be.

I did a couple of other things today, such as getting 2 pairs of $11 work pants so that I'll fit in the Shell dress code, and I also cleaned the living room, so yay for that. 

Well, that's it. Hope everyone had a wonderful today and will have a good tomorrow!"

"event","You know, this day has turned out to be rather normal. Sure, it's 6/6/06, or just 666 for all the Satanists out there, but it really hasn't been that special. Sure, I've listened to a bunch of metal, but that happens every day. No sacrificing of goats or other un-godly rituals for me today.Ah such is life I guess. 

What has occured today is, again, rather normal. I got to show off my finished animation to the workshop group today. They felt that it was much improved with the sound and all, so that was good to hear. The rest of class was spent watching other people's animations. So that's how that went down. This afternoon hasn't had too much going for it either. I did manage to clean the kitchen and take out that garbage, but beyond that I've just been chillin'. 

Yesterday was good for the most part. Class was just kinda there, but that's all right. We watched Tarkovsky's The Mirror instead of Andrei Rubylev which was nice because it was only 1hr 48 mins instead of 3 hrs 30 min. It was also a better film. Other events of yesterday included going into town to drop of a metal mix to Ty, but he wasn't at work so that sucked. I did manage to find Bury Your Dead's first CD You Had Me at Hello though, and it's pretty cool. Sure it's only 20 minutes long and 3 of the 10 songs are on Cover Your Tracks. Still it's a fun CD that's had me rockin' out during breaks from class. 

Speaking of class, tomorrow is my last day of class of the school year. Crazy, huh? So I'll be saying goodbye to my comrades in Animated Visions. It won't be so bad though because the group wasn't as tight as the Emerging Order Amigos. The scary part is that I'll be finished with my 3rd year of college. That's just crazy. Oh well, next year is going to be a BLAST!!! 

This thing sure has turned out to be rather long winded so I'll leave you all with one last thing...23 DAYS UNTIL OZZFEST!!!!!!"

"event","Geez, this weekend was busy. I guess I should clarify why. Well, this weekend just so happened to be the weekend of my sister's graduation party. Being such, she wanted a luau. That being the case, there was a whole crapload of decorating going on. I spent 8 hours (specifically 4pm to 12am) Friday and another 6 or 7 or something on Saturday setting up stuff for the party. Heck, the party started at 6 and I was still running. By about 7, when everything was pretty well set up, I was flat out exhausted. So yeah, it definitely wasn't a party party party type party for Chris. More or less, I just chatted it up with family members and chilled. The sister had fun though, so I guess that's good. Mother also owes me indefinite trips to Casa Mia, so I guess that's good too. 

Today saw the tearing down of everything (which thankfully lasted all of 2 hours, which is good compared to the other days) and me chillin' watchin' TV and doing not much else. Boring, but a nice change of pace.

Nearing the end of the quarter, just 1 more week of class and then it's eval week. It's crazy to think that I've only got 1 more year left here at good ol' Evergreen. It's sure been fun so far and next year is gonna be good. Roommate situation sounds solved. So good for that. 

Oh yeah, one more thing. 25 days until Ozzfest!!"

As for the other happenings, yesterday was a pretty fun day. Got see X-Men 3, which was cool because Iceman went into full ice mode! That's all I wanted from the movie, and although it only lasted a few seconds, it was awesome. To borrow a term from Gary, I ""geeked out"" over it. I also helped out Alonna on her project making wire frame salmon since I was pretty much done with all my own work anyways. We listened to a bunch of Cold, Unloco, and Spineshank while doing it, so that was fun. Oh yeah, and wrestling was good too! I actually wound up staying up until 3:30 am or so packing up some of my stuff that I won't need for the next couple weeks so that I can lighten the moving out burden for later. Yesterday was a good day overall. Still need to figure out the 6th roommate, so let's hope that happens soon."

Only issue is finding a 6th room mate again since Matt isn't coming back to Evergreen next year, so hopefully we'll figure that stuff all out.

Visions of being in the pit have gone through my head a lot lately (although that's not what was there this weekend). So yeah, Ozzfest just needs to get here already!

In other news, today is the first birthday of one little Twister. She's offically not a kitten anymore, but I'm still gonna call her kitten, so if anyone has a problem with that, they can take it up with my attorneys. 

Also, today marked the editing phase of my 3-D stop motion. Many thanks go out to Brian for helping Andrew and me out, although he doesn't read this, just figured I'd put that out there. Also got an MD recorder and need to record some noises to drop on in the film. So the thing is almost done. Last little school tidbit, I got my 8 pager back today and got glowing comments. It just proves that I'm a damn good writer. And there's my ego rearing it's ugly head. Oh well. 

Looking forward to seeing X-Men 3 this Thursday, mostly because Iceman is gonna go into full ice mode! Yeah, I don't geek out about much like my brother does, but Iceman, Boba Fett, and Cheetor are the exceptions. 

Cleaned house today, at least the living room and the bathroom anyways. I really ought to clean the kitchen but that just might have to wait for tomorrow. 

Also filled out the application for housing next year, gotta turn that stuff in tomorrow. Got a good group of people lined up to be living with, so that's good.  Next year=PARTY DORM!!! 

So overall, I'm back in my groove, doin' what I do. It feels darn good to be me right now. Just happy with how life's goin' I guess."

Pretty much done with class stuff. Just gotta add sound to my animation and that shouldn't be too hard. Oh yeah, the 3-D animation itself turned out okay. I like my other one better, but that's due to the content differences. I tried making a serious film this time and that really isn't a goal of my work. I still had fun, and I'm still happy with what Andrew and I did overall, so don't get me wrong on that. It's just that making a slasher flick is a lot more fun. 

Wednesday was pasta bar and it was fun. Other events of that night included everyone dogpiling on Tim to force him to watch his least favorite scene from I <3 Huckabees (it involves Jude Law looking like a woman). There was also a roundrobin wrestling tournament which Alonna won. I still took out Matt pretty quick though. Headlock, bulldog, STF match over in less than a minute. So that was a good night.

Lastnight was Manly Movie Night since Tim, Chris, Kirby, and I were the only ones around. We watched Face/Off with Nic Cage (awesome actor) and John Travolta (eh actor) and had fun with that. So yeah, things have been fun lately. 

Going to Dad's this weekend, stoked about that. Doing manual labor today though, not so stoked about that. Oh well. And again, that is now it, so lata homies!"

Life otherwise is still related to the whole school thing. I'm working on a 3-D animation which is being filmed on Thursday, and my 8 pager is officially in the books as done so that's a relief. Next couple weeks of class should be a breeze once the animation is done.

Up next on my plate is a stop-motion animation so that'll be fun. 

Last week was allright. Mostly the same as most other weeks. Wednesday and Thursday were fun as we done had 2 movie nights, although Thursday I was a little intoxicated (sorry Gary) so I didn't really watch the 2nd part of the film. I just bugged my friends instead. I avoided the hangover again because I had 4 bottles of water during the course of my drinking, so yay for that! 

Um, this week will probably be more of the same again, but that's allright because I usually have a good week anyways.

The movie was fun, even though I just watched it last week, it's one of those movies that can get away with being watched over and over. The working out was fun too, although it's the first time I've really worked out in a couple of years (although some of the work I've done with Grandpa Nodell has been physically demeanding). I'm not as strong as I was back in highschool, but that's what a couple years of idleing does to you. I shall get better though as I intend to start making a regular thing of it. So yeah, things have worked out so far today. Later tonight I think I'm gonna go to comics night over in U dorm, so that should be fun. Hopefully I get some more reading done too.

"event","Well, I'd like to start off by saying that I had an awesome night tonight, for the most part. Watched Scream 3 with the homies, got to play some Mario Kart, and also got to go on a nighttime hike out in the Evergreen woods. Great fun for sure. The only downer is that the guy that I wanted to win on Survivor, Shane, was voted out this evening, so that sucks! I was expecting it though, so it softened the blow a little, I just wished that he had made the final four. But such is life. At least I can say that one of my favorites won, which is something no one else in my family can say, so there. Oh well. It's late, Chris go sleepy now."

Heya, here's an animation I done worked on with Chelsea Baker. Spent 7 hours in the studio this evening putting it all together. It was fun. Enjoy the stinkin thing, okay? By the way, that's sand and not some other illegal substance on the mirror at the end."

"event","In a moment of pure brain lapse I somehow decided to have 9 inches of my hair cut off today. So yeah, now the lucious locks ain't so majestic. Okay, so I'm being a little overdramatic here. It was my first haircut in 2 1/2 years and I actually like it, and it makes practical sense. I mean, in mosh pits my hair gets pulled like crap, so now I've got enough to still have fun headbanging with but not too much to where every strand actually hurts at the end of the night. So I'm fine with the change. (By the way, anyone who reads this who makes contact with my mother (ie. Cassie, Dad, ect.) please don't tell her, I'd like to shock her myself)

In other news, anyone who likes metal or hard rock needs to find a way to listen to the new Lacuna Coil CD ""Karma Code."" It's freakin' awesome, definitely the best of '06 so far!

So yeah, finished another late Monday night class. We never stinkin' finish class on time! Oh well. Maybe tomorrow.

Well that's about it, lata homies!

"event","Well, done with class for the week. Turns out that there's only 5 1/2 hours on Tuesdays, so that's a normal Emerging Order type day. So Monday really is the only brutal day of any of them, and I'll probably get used to it. Today was pretty cool. There was a guest lecturer who gave an overview of 1000 years of Russian history in about 2 hours. It was all pretty interesting. I'm also starting Lenin's The State and Revolution which is intersting so far. I think I'm going to enjoy the Russian studies a lot more than I did the science aspects of EO. 

Also got my first animation assignment. It's a paper cut out assignment similar to the one I did of Twister and Tom Hanks in the fall, but this time I'm going to do something much more complicated that involves a monkey, a disco, and some illegal substances. Should be fun. 

This weekend, I'll be heading out to mother's get to see the family and the........wait for it......... KITTIES!!!! So that should be fun."

"event","Well it be the start of another quarter here at the delightful and charming Evergreen State College. I'm in a program called Animated Visions: Allegories of Resistance. It's got animation as well as Russian literature, poetry, and history all rolled into one happy burrito type thing. I got into the animation workshop so I'm really stoked about that. Something I'm not so stoked about is the schedule, as it's a wee bit crazy. I'm in class on Monday from 10am-12pm, then from 1pm-3pm, which seems normal enough but the kicker is that from 7pm-10pm there's class screenings. Now anyother night of the week, this would probably be all right, but Monday night is wrasslin' night. I guess I'll be watching Tuesday Afternoon Raw during this quarter. Tuesdays are just as brutal, as there's class from 9am-10am and then workshop from 10:30am-4:30pm. For those of you counting at home, that's 14 hours of class in 2 days! Wednesday is more normal 9:30-12:30. And I don't have class on Thursday and Friday, so I guess I'll be getting 4 day weekends. So yeah, it should be a fun class, just a little crazy during the first part of the week. 

Life otherwise is allright. Found out Ozzfest is coming to WA this summer, so that's good. Wrestlemania was enjoyable for the most part barring Cena's win. And I'll get to see some kitties this weekend. Geez, only Monday and I'm already ready for the weekend! Oh well."

"event","So yeah, I done got to go see KoRn this past Sunday night and I must say that I had a massively fun time. Both Mudvayne and KoRn were great. 10 Years, the openers, were just average, but they only played for 30 minutes anyways. Mudvayne was just crazy. The pit for them was as crazy as it had ever been for any other band I've ever seen. Ironically, during ""Not Falling,"" I fell. I wound up on the bottom of a pile of people and could barely breath. So yeah, that done took a bit out of me. Kirby wound up sticking with me pretty well, but Matt was nowhere to be seen. So after 45 minutes of brutality, we went to go get some water and done ran into Matt again and Alonna too. Hung out a while waiting for KoRn. When they done started, I was about in the middle of the pit area. I wound up moving up to about 4 people back from the front, but alas, it was just too crazy and I couldn't see much, so I done dropped back. Luckily there was a bubble where there was room to just hang out and head bang and I wound up running back into Alonna again. I could actually see a lot better from there and the sound was more audible. KoRn themeselves were f'n awesome! They played for 2 hours, which was great. I was suprised because a lot of the songs from See You on the Other Side came off really well live when I didn't expect them to. So all in all I had a great time and was glad to have some friends there in the pit, because that usually doesn't happen. Definitely one of the top 3 or 4 concerts I've been to. 

On the school front, just nearing the end. My freakin' minidisc wouldn't work today when I tried to extract the tracks to use in my animation, but other than that, the project has gone smoothly. Over 40 freakin' hours spent on the blasted thing, geez, but like I said, it's almost over for now. 

Pretty stoked for this weekend, as it's the B-day weekend and I'll get to see Gary, so that should be what they call fun. 

Also psyched for March 18th as I'm gonna have a Pizza party, so that should be fun too!

Well, gotta get back to work. So that is all."

"event","Y'all have seen I <3 Huckabees, right? Yeah, me and my friends done watched that and Cry Baby today. Well once we got to the part where they start hitting eachother in the face with the ball trying to get eachother to stop thinking, Tim got the bright idea to try it himself. So I started hittin' him with the pillow and he couldn't get it to work, so I let him start hitting me, but it didn't work either. Matt claimed it worked on him, but since we're all dudes, it devolved into us just smacking eachother in the face as hard as we could with pillows. It was fun. Everyone liked the movie so that was good. Cry Baby was a bit wierd but funny too. On the class front, I'm nearing the home stretch of my project. Just 20 more frames to animate and then I get to shoot the whole thing and edit sound in. Yayhoo. I'm pretty psyched for this Sunday as I get to see my favorite band again. KORN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The week after that, I'll be 21 so yeah, things are going pretty good right now. Life is fun."

"event","Well, this weekend was good and bad. Overall average. 
See the main reason for it being bad is that little Twister was wounded. She got bit by something so she had to spend Friday at the vets. When we got her on Saturday, she was all drugged up and had one of those cones around the head to keep her from licking herself. When it came time for mother to give her her medicine, Twist didn't like it one bit. She also hates the fact that she's cooped up inside for the next two weeks. So yeah, I feel bad for my kitten. 
Also on Saturday, I done did some manual labor. I had to break up concrete mess and fill potholes in the road with it. Doing a sort of a butter churn motion with a big pry bar and shoveling all that crap sure did a number on my shoulders. They be really sore.
Today, for most of the day I worked on my final animation project. Done drew a monkey and a kitty and stuff about perception. I'll post it when it's done. 
So the part that makes the weekend good is that I done found out that next weekend, KoRn is playing a HUGE set. Like 27 songs huge!
01.It's On--fun song, haven't heard it live since Sick and Twisted 2000
02.Clown--fun song, heard last on Ozzefest 2003
03.Divine-- Same as above
04.Love Song(This is when all the back up band was revealed)--One of the new songs, so it should be intersting to see how it comes off live.
05. Falling Away From Me-- A classic. Always fun.
06.Souvenir-- Another new song, one of the better slow ones.
07.Here To Stay-- This probably should be the opener since it's one of thier heaviest songs.
*MUNKY'S SOLO*
08.Dirty-- Didn't come off so well last time I saw them, but we'll see.
09.Liar-- The most aggressive new song they'll play, should be good.
10.Counting On Me-- A good track from TALITM, never heard it live
11.Somebody, Someone-- Not so good on the Korn Live DVD, but both times I've heard it live it was good
12.Throw Me Away-- New song, should be fun
13.Shoots and Ladders-- Bag pipes, yay.
14.Need To-- Another one off of S/T
15.LIES-- My favorite off of S/T, I've never heard it live so it should be great
16.Make Me Bad-- Always good.
17.Thoughtless-- Could be good, could be just all right
18.ADIDAS-- This one always gets the crowd in a frenzy, should be fun
19.Twist-- short, but fun everytime
*Ending of open up with the scatting* -- I wish they would play the whole song since it's my fave of SYOTOS
20.Coming Undone-- All right
21.Did My Time-- Good good good
22.Got the Life-- This is always fun
23.Tearjerker-- Should be interesting as it's their softest song ever, should be a good chill out song before the encore

*ENCORE*
24.Twisted Transistor-- We'll see how this comes off live
25.HYPOCRTIES-- This will be good, as it's another of the heavier SYOTOS tracks
26.Freak On a Leash-- They obviously could not get away with not playing this song
27.Blind-- Just like my first Korn concert, they'll end with this one

So yeah, I'm pretty stoked about the long set. There are a few songs I'd rather them play such as Good God, Dead Bodies Everywhere, Trash, Blame, Everything I've Known, and Open Up, but I'm sure I'm going to have a great time. Just one week!!!"

"event","Ahhh. I done cranked out 9 pages of a 10 page paper yesterday. Amazingly, it took a grand total of only 9 hours which is good becuase I tend to usually take 2 hours per page when doing papers like this. So I must've been more focused than usual. Earlier this weekend, I went and saw the School Yard Heroes Friday night after cleaning house all day, had a few friends over for dinner Saturday, had a couple more over last night, and I get to watch wrasslin' tonight. Fun weekend, it's just too bad that it had to coincide with a weekend that I had a chance to see Gary. But if I had gone up to see him I wouldn't have done so well on my paper, so I hope he's allright with that. I'll see him in 3 weeks anyways when we turn 21. And then I'll also see him for Wrestlemania weekend. Well, got to get to writing that last page of that stinkin' paper, so later."

"event","Curious George was a rather delightful little movie. While most of the secondary characters were pretty generic, George was awesome. It's a movie definately meant for children, but it was still enjoyable. You really can't tell that Will Ferrel did the Man in the Yellow Hat's voice, but Drew Berrymore's character looked just like an animated version of her which was kinda annoying actaully. But overall a fun movie that was worth seeing."

Just figured I'd let people know that if you done want to see some of my animations you can go to www.myspace.com/chris_clark_44 go to my general interests section and clicky clicky to watch my walk and a claymation piece that is what I consider to be the best thing I've ever done in my entire life. No Joking homies! If I'm sounding weird it's because I'm going on about 1.5 hours of sleep because I was up until 5 am editing the clay piece and actually didn't fall asleep until closer to 6 or so. So yeah, go check that stuff out. DO IT!!! I'm about 3.5 hours away from seeing Curious George, so that should be fun. I'll let y'all know how it is."

In addition, I've got a 10 page research paper to do some studying for, and animation sequence to accompany it, and a whole crapload of work that I've got to do.

Overall things have been fairly good with the only real downer of the past month being that the Bears were eliminated from the playoffs last week. Other than that, I've made a Chris Jericho animation, read some books, and wrote papers. Not too much else has happened that detracts from the ordinary. The good news is that I'm gonna go see KoRn on March 5 with Kirby, Matt and Alonna. We got pit tickets so that should be a great time. Not much else left to say."

"event","Oh yeah, got the new KoRn album today and it fuckin' rocks! There's a lot more of an industrial influence, and some of the songs are a lot softer than most of their other stuff. Still good stuff though. Only on my second listen through so far, but it's better than the first time, so that's a good thing. Fun fun fun.
AWK on Friday night was amazing, I enjoyed the School Yard Heroes as well. Saturday, I mostly played wrestling on PS2 with Gary. Sunday, the Bears done beat the Packers. Last night I had a Red Lobster hamburger since it was mother's birthday. All in all a great stretch of 5 days."

"event","Hey, here's the link to the latest class project. http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/emergingorder/Students.php
Go down to the Realism to Abstraction link, click on it, watch it, enjoy it assuming you have Quicktime. My section is one of the shorter ones. At 2:42 in my pinecone goes from two triangles to an abstract form to a regular pinecone and then explodes. It's all over by about 2:46 so don't blink. The rest of the movie is pretty cool too. Tyrel did the section right before mine with the porpuse and the shark, and it's actually one of the best sections in my opinion.
Other happenings, there ain't much other than the fact that my Chicago Bears are 8-3! Heck yeah, they've looked good the past couple weekends against teams that are also contenders in the NFC and they've done it with defense. It's been fun to watch this year, so let's hope it continues. 
This Friday I'm gonna go see Andrew W.K. so that ought to be fun, and since it's Tuesday now, there's only one more week until the new KoRn! I'm gonna have a good week I think."

I drew just one tile, with the red skull in the center and the 4 parts of the orange ones on each side. It didn't quite line up, but it works well enough. As for why I only got 1 hour of sleep last night, lets just say that I played 12 hours straight of Raw vs. Smackdown 2006 and didn't get to sleep until 7 am. Yes, the game is that fun. Other than that, not much else is up right now, I'm guessing I'll have another late night, but I'll probably be out before 7. Well, that's about it. Later

"event","So yeah, last night I went and saw Bury Your Dead at Studio 7. It was a good show indeed. The other 4 bands were Fight Scene, August Burns Red, Scars of Tomorrow, and Terror. They were all fun, and I certianly intend on picking up Scars of Tomorrow's CD, but Bury Your Dead was definatley the best. I managed to be in the very front, leaning on the stage, but that wasn't too hard as there was only one row of people agianst the barrier. Everyone else kinda formed a ring that went 20 to 30 feet back or so, and there were a bunch of dudes in the middle doing windmill punches and spin kicks to the music. It was not what I was used to, but it's what I expected since the show was technically a ""hardcore"" show and not a ""metal"" show. So I wound up getting kicked in the chin by a stage diver, punched in the back of the head by one of the afformentioned persons in the pit, and piggybacked by people trying to scream into the mic. Good times. Bury Your Dead was really good, even though they only played for 30 minutes, (actually every band wound up playing about 30 minutes). I was up front and got to headbang real good, got the mic shoved in my face a few times, so I got to scream into it. Overall good times. At the end of the set, there was kind of a dogpile on the lead singer. Since I was front and center, everyone went over me and I wound up on the bottom of the pile. So yeah, both my forearms are bruised and my neck is pretty sore. It's alright though, as I had a great time. Seriously, the most fun times of my life are in the pits at concerts. After the show, I got to shake the singer's hand and he thanked me for hanging out up front and helping him sing, so that was cool. I'm still pumped up about the whole thing. 
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go see Saw 2. Kirby and I rented the first one to watch tonight as he hasn't seen it yet and wanted to see it before he saw the sequal. So yeah, good times are ahead."

"event","Wednesday is the day and nothing's going down. I just gotta get started on a take home mathmatics ""assesment assignment"" (cause we don't do tests at Evergreen). Class kinda sucked because Netlogo kept on freezing on me. 
Tuesday was pretty uneventful as well, although I'm getting to start up on a spiffy animation project. Minimum of 30 hand drawn frames, should be good. I'm doing a transforming pinecone. 
Monday, Halloween. I dressed up in my Jericho costume, which turned out well. Watched wrasslin' not much happened. 
Sunday, the Bears were winners, so life is good. 4-3 and atop the division. Yay Bears.
So there's the last few days in a nutshell.
Tonight, I've got a writing meeting, South Park and whatever other things come up.
No class tomorrow!
Later.

"event","Fuck Yeah! I'm listening to a new KoRn song, ""Eaten Up Inside."" I tried to find the single in stores today, but alas, I could not. So instead I downloaded it. Pretty cool song. Sounds like KoRn's going in a different direction with thier new album, so it should be fun.
In other news, I'm making a Chris Jericho costume for Halloween. Went to the Goodwill and found some obnoxious hot pink pants which I'm painting on to look like a pair of Jericho's tights. Also got some kneepads and an elbow pad. Just need to get some letter stickers so I can put Role Model on my rubber boots. 
South Park was pretty good tonight too.
Tomorrow, I Animac it up. Got some expensive equipment in my room right now, so I should have some fun tomorrow.

"event","3:06 in the am, and I gotta be up at 8:30. Oh well, such is the price for having to stay up late to do homework that I should've done earlier in the day. Later on today, I'm probably gonna sort out pictures from the field trip, work in NetLogo, and pick up the animac. After all that shiznit is done, I'm gonna go pick me up the new KoRn single, as it has a song that's not going to be on the new album on it. So I have something to look forward to tomorrow. Well, the TV in my room is making wierd noises, so I think I'm gonna unplug it. There, it's done. So good night friend(s). [just in case Brad is indeed the only one who reads this]
Later."

"event","I'm gonna go see Bury Your Dead in 2 weeks. Should be a good time. 
The Bears done won the last 2 weekends, are now at 3-3, and are playing the Lions next week for sole posession 1st place in the NFC North.
Class has been alright. I animated an imaginary leaf growing and dying today.
I was in La Push all last week for class. We did beach exploring and such. 
Don't really have much else to say, so that is it."

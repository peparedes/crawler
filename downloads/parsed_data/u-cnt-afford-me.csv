"event","Hey...Its been awhile

So my fabulous friends and survivors (haha just joshing ya!) I have landed a role in the play, Mureil Foster. I hope you all come and see me shine brighter than the sun in the sky! Yes yes it will be much fun!

So...It turns out that I am also going to attend the Yellowcard concert as well! Yay for me, and it also turns out that I just might manage to take my other livejournal friend, pinking_shears with me, which would be awesome like usual! I love hanging out with that crazy chica!

But, school is going great. Sadly, I still haven't met the love of my life yet! I'm still waiting. But I have a lonnnnnngg life ahead of me and I'm a patient girl...that is,if I like what I'm getting.

I have a Russian project due and I'm looking forward to that. I like russian class and the year after next i will be going to russia! Plus for Carla!! oh yea! 

URGH!!! I have a preformance monday at school and I'm not looking forward to it! Its my Italien art song and I am sooo not prepared...I have sooo much work ahead of me, but nobody told me high school was going to be easy. Everyone said it was going to be fun....and it is....but I can't stand the workload

Whoever thinks SOTA workload is an oxy-moron is a moron themself. It is not easy going to this school. It kicks ass, and it kicks my @$$! But I love it and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world!!!

mucho love for now (i might decide i hate you later jk)

"event","Why hello! I'm sorry I haven't been updating But I'll make up for my lost time right now!

    I have been so busy with my life, and that is partly why I haven't been updating (the other reason is because i forgot my username but all thats clear now) I know al of you have been dying to here the memoirs of my life. So your wait was not in vain, for I am back, and with many a more interesting tale to share with you.

     Latly it seems, that my popularity has gotten the better of me. It seems, that I have been invited to so many parties I just can't keep hold of my head! And all my social engagments have just kind of swarmed up into One huge social engagment which is never ending! The phone has been ringing off the hook with people who want my autograph, or want to see me, or just plain worship the ground I walk on, or movie deals or things like that. but Let me first give you the life of parties I have recently been invited to or attended...

~Carol Channing Day at whos-its mansion

~A fashion breakout thing for Versace (and they had the nerve to ask me to model for them!)

~The Usher Concert (Which I found rather intriguing)

~Two fabulous friend's birthday party ( I couldn't make either one! I'm sorry)

~And tons more

   The Franz Ferdinan Concert is to come, and many more. Just last week, i auditioned for a musical AND a play! Both of which i got called back for th leading roles, yes yes, i was quite shocked too, but I can hardly say I deserve a callback! but altogether, my efforts are being rewarded.

    I had a funny thing happen to me yesterday. i was doing a sing-through with my old company (because they asked me to) and I was invited over to this young lady's house to spend the night. Sweetly, i accepted, and when I got over to her house...I realized, I can't stand her. So I quikly ""remembered"" I had homework to do and called my Father who lickity-split got over and snatched me away from the evil clutched of this person. Who shall reman anonymous for her safety... but yes, can you imagine what might've happened to me if I HAD stayed the night...OH it would have been dreadful! I'm soooo thankful

 But yes, I'm studying for this part I got called back for and I she really reminds me of Marilyn Monroe, who I idolize.....

     I'm on to brighter topics now so I will catch you cool cats later...

Much much much love,
     Carla

"event","Today I gave the performance of my life...I sang ""Home"" And well, actually, it really did suck...but otherwise I had other things to worry about...
LIKE GUYS!
Ya see, there is this boy, whom I like very much as a friend. He's funny, sweet, caring, and thoughtful, not to mention smart...but he likes me, and I don't think I like him like that...If we did go out, we would most likely break up and not be friends and then it would all be weird because we will be going to school together and it would all go to hell in a handbag from there on out!!!
I'm soo confused, tired, bored, and sick of being alone....
I wish there was someone who knew all the answers to lifes problems, then they would just tell me how to solve them and I wouldn't feel guitly in any circumstance...
So long for now all..
xoxoxoxox,
Carla"

"event","Have faith in god for he gives all! ( I haven't the faintest idear why i just said that but follow my lead!!!)
Life is good right now except for the fact that people usually don't hold parties on a Wednesday night therefore I am stuck inside. I am at my friends house(YES SHE IS A GIRL)having the freaking time of my life! NOT, but i soon will be! I wish I was a princess then i wouldn't have to deal with sad little idiots who trouble my already dainty mind with stupid problems that i don't even give two beans about! But then, I suppose princesses get they're first credit cards at the age of ten, so I am already far behind! Oh well, I'll just have to grow up and marry some poor old rich geezer, kill him, and get the money!!!(JK to all you old people)
        I'm sick of being single, besides the last relantionship I had Sucked MARJORLY, but i suppose thats how one would feel after a bad breakup. One heart always gets broken, unles neither person cares, which did not happen in my case. LMAO! My ex was sucxh a liar! He told one of my friends that he broke up with me cause I was too conceited, and then he told another one of my friends that he broke up with me cause He lost interest in me! lol! I find that sooo funny! 
         I have come to one conclusion that will mean everything to me later in life....I have to become rich and famous otherwise life will not be the way that I want it, and I'm sure everyone knows, getting what you want is one of the best things in life! 

Love ya'll,

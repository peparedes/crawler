Some would even be welcome in both, I imagine.  Particularly with the sort of women who seem to be gathering over there."

"event","It's Amiya.&nbsp; My dearest, most charmingly explosive Amiya.&nbsp; Amina would have made things odd with the first mate, whose name ye also got wrong.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; It's Ayemmin, propperly written as Ajemin, which is prolly where that confusion came from.&nbsp; An' his most miraculous daughter, Lulia.&nbsp; Funny that the one ye were most confused about is the one ye got right.&nbsp; :)

And my ships are <i>not</i> slow, hulkin' lugs, damnit.&nbsp; Just because they ain't fit to go traipsin' about in a damn reef don't make them lugs."

I am the Mad Captain Skal of Clewnemor, and admit that I am not the Captain for ye if ya wish someone to ferry goods and <s>annoyances</s> passengers across the sheltered crescent and back all day long.  In fact, I'm probably not the Captain for ye unless ye're glare-loved desperate.

But if ye really need to get that shipment around the bulk of Folceni before one of the storming seasons truly sets in?  I'm the <i>only</i> Captain for ye.

Ya poor soul."

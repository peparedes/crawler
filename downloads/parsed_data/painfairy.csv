"event","*~* Putting The Damage On *~*

Glue,
Stuck to my shoe.
Does anyone know why,
you play with an orange rind?
You say you packed my things
and divided what was mine.


You're off to the mountain top.
I say her skinny legs could use sun.


But, now I'm wishing,
for my best impression
of my best Angie Dickinson.
But, now I've got to worry
cause, boy, you still look pretty
when you're putting the damage 
when you're putting the damage on.


Don't make me scratch on your door.
I never left you
for a Banjo.
I only just turned around for a poodle
and a corvette.


and my impression
of my best Angie Dickinson.
But, now, I've got to worry
cause, boy, you still look pretty
when you're putting the damage on.


I'm trying not to move,
it's just your ghost 
passing through.
I said
I'm trying not to move
it's just your ghost passing through,
it's just your ghost passing through,
and now I'm quite sure...


There's a light in your platoon.
I've never seen a light move
like yours.
Can do to me,


so now I'm wishing
for my best impression
of my best Angie Dickinson,
but, now, I've got to worry
cause boy you still look pretty
to me,
but, I've got a place to go.
I've got a ticket to your late show.


And now I'm worrying cuase even still
you sure are pretty
when you're putting the damage,
yes,
when you're putting the damage,
you're just so pretty.
When you're putting the damage on...."

"event","what a shitty day at the salon today. i wouldnt have had anyone if i didnt take these two stupid updo's. i hate doing them. anyways they turned out really good and they made me feel good in a way cause i didnt think i could still do one and i just said fuck it and tried. i made 150 off of both of them. unfortunatly i only keep 50%.i went out after work tonight for the first time in a long time. and i just went to bennigans w/ my friend. was fun though. i didnt even drink. weird huh. haha. mario called me tonight and he said that he had something hysterical to tell me. i never called him back. mabey ill do that now. he said it was a video on the comp. i miss him so much. he is so sweet. lately we talk alot more. still not tons, but enough. i could go years w/ out talking to him and we would be the same as we always have been. i want to go to ny so bad. i am craving a vacation. i just started here though and im broke. i have the family reunion i have to go to also in sept. .

"event","its 6am and i cant sleeep. i already was in bed for a while. i just watched the news for a hour hoping to fall asleep....no luck. figured ill write in my journal. yesterday was nasty out. rained like hell. there was tornados and hail. haha. how the fuck did we get hail. its like 100 everyday and the air in my car is still broke. i cant do anything til the sun goes down. im soaked when i get to work. cant believe i turned away living in the cold. this weather makes you feel like your smoothering. its actually scary sometimes. s

 when i hear the song ""this love-liz fraser"" it makes me think of someone. i need the lyrics to make sure they are good and apropriate. its so weird too cause at the salon they play shitty ass music, well the other day i started to think of her and that song came on. ive been thinking of that alot for the past few days. i dont know. just seemed weird to me. its like i want to start over but im so scared. ive hurt her way to bad, damaged way to much. im almost ashamed. i have baggage now that i dont want and dont know how to rid of it. i would love to be able to go back to the beginning, start fresh. i would even consider counceling if we neeeded. i still think the break is good. was very benificial for me even though i might have ruined the one person i love. i know i have damaged her for life possibly,something she will probably never get over in her head, i hate myself for it. the one person who was sincere and loyal to me and i fucked her over. i am so deeply sorry for the painn i have cause her, restless nights, heart pains, empty feelings, and hate. you should never feel that, you are a beautiful girl!"

"event","Another Day
The sun rises slowly
On another day
The eastern sky grows 
Cold
Winter in water colours
Shades of grey

Something
Something holds me
Holds me hypnotized

I stare at the window
Stare at the window
Waiting for the day 
To go
Winter in water colours
Shades of grey"

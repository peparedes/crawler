"event","I had a vury bad expurience on Thursday.  Yeah.  There are some problems with the show.  Most of them have to do with me.  

1) I have no time to rehearse my act, so it sucks.
2) I have no time to promote the show, so no one shows up.
3) I have no financial backing to advertise the show, so no serious comedy fans show up.
4) I had this idea that giving comics longer sets would draw them to the show, but it's ended up killing the crowd midway through the first or second set.  

Yeah, just preparing for when Sunshine buries me and my crew on the yucks board.  The GM at Max's thinks I'm bringing in a bunch of amateurs.  The crowd thinks I'm bringing in amateurs.  But I'm not, I'm the amateur.  So, hopefully, I can find someone to host the next show.  If I have time, I'll do five minutes.  Otherwise, I'll be offstage until I have time to rehearse and write.  That's what's on my mind.  More later."

"event","It's my one year anniversary with Bridget today.  We counted from the day we moved in together.  Over the past year, I've managed to hold down a job and a place for the first time ever and for the most part I've even kept my bills current.  A little help from Pop at the beginning is all I needed.  One year later, we've fought, cried and fought some more but I still love her as much as I did when we moved in together.  So, we're going out tonight.  I've learned a lot over the past year, and I thought I'd share.

1) Any thought I had of more sex because we sleep in the same bed every night was WRONG!  You know how they say absence makes the heart grow fonder?  Apparently, it makes the loins grow fonder too.  Not in my case, but at least they work now.

2) Working hard does not entitle you to anything, except being expected to continue with the hard-working.

3) Leisure time is a more valuable commodity than leisure money.

4) Cocaine's a hell of a drug.  I've been clean for a year, and I'd still do a line if I thought no one was looking.

5) Razor sharp wits and dirty minds run in my family.

6) Selling plasma hurts.  And they'll pay you extra for keeping your mouth shut about screw ups.

7) Prophecy: If you guys don't come out with me, you can't be my friends anymore.  I've still got it.

That's all for now/"

"event","Yeah, so I've got a little broadband access for a second.

My job just cut my hours, so I took the extra time to drive out to Colorado and reflect a little.  You know, my only regret is I haven't seen my friends much.  It sucks, but it's the price I pay for having a little security.  I'm an extreme guy it would seem.  I'm either all up ons or off the deep end.  To keep my house in order, I've been all about my job and getting my shit together.  My girl said I changed.  Now, I find myself going to work with a sneer on my face and a song in my heart that ain't ""Whistle While You Work"".  I'm working on finding a happy medium.

I've been off the hard drugs for eight months now.  I feel better, but my body is still letting me know I've fucked up.  Coke and meth ain't exactly something I can be moderate with, so I deal with the cravings every day and work to restore some piece of mind knowing that I'm a better person for keeping my promises and not being a junkie.

I'm still upset by the fact that it's easier to deal with my situation with a little bit of hash.  I want to be pissed off enough to up and change it, but I've got other people's feelings to keep in mind.  I tend not to pull punches when I want to get a point across, and that pisses a lot of people off.  Again searching for that medium.

I really want to move out of Akron.  I love my friends here, but I look around the city and I don't see any life.  I see people stuck here out of fear of the unknown or poverty.  Sauerkraut Balls and Swensons is all well and good, but catching a good show at Annabells or the Spider is a rare occurence.  I see college bar-hoppers and jocks dominating the Akron nightlife.  I hear the alternative media spewing the same shit as the mainstream with a liberal edge.  I see Akron more like my favorite toilet.  I feel comfortable enough to shit there, but there's no other attachment.  I want a city that's like a pair of open legs waiting to be pillaged.

I went to sell plasma for the first time today.  Quite an interesting experience.  Every single nurse there assumed I was going to freak out and run out of the building or something, 'cause there were about four of 'em standing around me until the blood got flowing.  Apparently, steak is not conducive to giving blood.  Got twenty bucks for it, so I have some gas and smokes.  And I bought a bagel.  Yay.

If you ever want to know how bad the economy is, spend some time at the welfare office.  It doesn't matter what social class people used to be in - most of them have no choice but to ask Big Brother for help.

"event","Ragnarok was a learning experience for me this year.  I learned that the Roman banner is not to be the subject of a gag, I learned that Madog is still a selfish, self-righteous bastard who validates his beliefs through his battles to purify Dagorhir, and I learned that I have become somethings that I truly hate: a diplomat and a leech.

Because Will, Joanne, Devin, Michelle, Jen, Charles, Sara, Neil, Mandy, Jay, Jenine, Chris and Brian refused to deal with their problems themselves, Mark, Erin, Grace, Bridget and I are done with Mirkwood.  If you have a problem with one of your friends, say it to their face.  Don't chatter amongst your sewing circle and let the hatred fester until the only thing left to do is turf your friend.  You all say you're family, but you DON'T have the one thing families possess: unconditional love.  It kills you all that these people that you love and cherish have all these faults that you are forced to deal with, and they will never change.  But when you are asked for that unconditional love required to keep these doomed relationships afloat, you put on a fake smile and detach yourselves from the situation and say it's for the good of the kingdom.  The fact of the matter is, it's not for the good of the kingdom, it's so you all can feel like saints for putting up with each other as long as you have.  Deal with it.  It's not a bad thing to have false intentions- if you're a chode.

Here are the facts in the kingdom.

Devin is embarassed by Grace's presence because she is proof that he has no self control.  When a man needs to take out his anger on someone else in order to hold the relationship he can control together, what does that make him?  Because that's what's happening.  You can say that a BDS&M relationship is a healthy, acceptable way for two people to relate until you're blue in the face, and I still won't believe it.  You can't beat someone for their benefit, EVER.  Masochism is not something to be celebrated, it is the symptom of a greater problem that needs to be addressed.  Devin, we've been cool for a long time, but you're acting like a kid, taking your ball and going home when you need to come out and defend what you did.  You pussied out because you're afraid to admit you were wrong, or you're too much of a coward to face the conflict the situation would bring.  I'm not afraid to admit I was wrong: I was wrong to believe you had any intentions for this kingdom other than an ego boost.  If Will hadn't begged you to come back and made you feel special, you would have stayed at home.  If it's not one game, it's another though, so have fun trying to talk some other sap into being your court jester.

I refuse to be everybody's yes man.  Because that's what I've been doing.  It felt natural because I wanted all of my friends to get along.  I tried my best to get everyone to accept Sam and Michelle back into the group, but no one wanted to hear it.  That should have clued me in right there that no one in Mirkwood really wants to be a family.  Think about it.  All Sam did was point out your faults and none of you wanted to hear it.  He offered a solution and you were too offended to hear it.  Michelle did nothing to you; you just lumped her in with Sam.  And I know Joe and Debby are going to say ""well, Sam made up a blatant lie about Joe, so I shouldn't trust him.""  You guys had known Sam for how long at that point?  Wouldn't you think it was a joke?  Drop it.  That has absolutely no bearing on his character, because it was in jest, and your own insecurity made it worse than it was.  Yeah, why am I picking on Joe and Debby?  Because I OWE THEM THAT!  They are my friends!  They deserve to know that they are being idiots.  I should have told them earlier, but I wanted to make everyone happy.  My heart was in the right place, but my methods were crap.  

Neil and Sara-MARK AND ERIN INTRODUCED YOU TWO!  How DARE you turn against Erin!  You didn't even invite them to your wedding.  Even if you sent the invitation, you didn't make the effort to let them know that they were welcome to celebrate the love they helped you to discover.  You told me often about how you hated the way Erin treated Mark, but you never told her.  She's the one that needs to hear that, not me.  I am not going to fix the situation that you seem to have a problem with.  If you have a problem, speak on it.  I thought you, Sara, of all people would know that.

Bridget and Mandy finally had it out, and you all got to watch with delight as the two former sisters tried to be civil for the sake of the kingdom.  STOP IT!  Being the venting receptacle for each of them is not helping.  These two people were once very close, and now they're not because Mandy won't take responsibility for her actions and Bridget refuses to make it all better by taking the blame and saying, ""it'll be okay.""  Jay, check your woman into rehab.  Alcoholism is a problem that can be fixed.  Don't be afraid to confront the problem.  If you both are as strong as you think you are, you can get through this.

I got complaints about Erin and Grace not doing enough work at Rag.  I didn't see Jen do anything.  Two years in a row.  Who checked her on it?  NO ONE!  Jen, this should be a clue that Charles isn't your one and only, because if he loved you, he would call you on it instead of tolerating you for the rent money.  Be up front with each other for once instead of living in your own separate fantasies and coexisting because nothing else makes sense.  Grow up.

There is a huge cowardice problem in this kingdom.  That's why you will be nothing on the field.  The first rule of fighting is to show no fear.  You're all afraid to face each other, how can you expect to face your enemies on the field?  Janine, check your man.  You're good enough to do better, but you refuse to because you're afraid to stand up for yourself.  Quit it.  It's annoying, and all your friends are doing is coddling you so that they can quit thinking about their own lives for once.

Chris, I was wrong.  This should have been done when the problem was first brought up.  Waiting until the end of Rag made Mark and Erin's vacation feel worthless, and they feel used.  They may never trust me again because I withheld information that might have saved their Rag for them.  I feel used now.  I feel like I was manipulated for the good of the kingdom now, not just Mark.  Even if at the time, I saw eye to eye with you, I was looking through the wrong lens.  The good of the kingdom means nothing - how many have you been in before now?  Your friends are all that matters in this game.  Otherwise, the game just isn't as fun.  Don't fall into the same trap I did, and let everyone use you.  You're too good for that.

Brian, the time has come to finish what you started.  That's it.

And Will, everyone has been saying this behind your back for years, I'm going to say it to your face: GROW A SPINE!  You have become a puppet for anyone that makes the conflict go away and makes Shatterhaze look good.  Stop it.  Quit while you can still look yourself in the mirror in the morning and see your own reflection, instead of a character you created for a game.  You said yourself that it's taken over your life, well get it back.  Mark and Erin are never going to be able to look you in the eye again without scorn because you didn't have the testicles to follow your hero's example.  You never wanted my opinion in the great hall, you wanted my validation.  And I gave it to you, like an idiot.  It's taken hours of tears and anger to figure out that I can't enjoy the dorker wars like you can.  I can't be the diplomat and the charismatic elf that you are.  I can't - because I still have my integrity and courage.  I'm not going to give them up ever again, even if it means that I have to hurt some feelings.  I should have gone with my gut, called you a coward and punched you in the face for selling out your friends.  But, I didn't.  Like you, I went along with the Star Trek logic, and now I'm suffering for it.  You're going to keep suffering unless you grow a set and get your house in order.

We might be leaving Mirkwood, but we are not leaving Dagorhir.  I said at the meeting that kingdom problems are not the Church's problem.  So we will continue to exist.  I also said that we are a crew, and we will treat each other like crews treat each other, not like a bunch of women.  I also said that we are getting our own camp next year.  The last bit, I said it and I'm doing it.  The first two, I preached them, but I didn't follow them.  Yeah, enough mea culpas.  I had enough with Dominus on Friday.  But here's the thing.  You will be forced to deal with us because we're not too far away to ignore.  We're not running from the problems.  You can do one of two things: be with us, or be against us.  Either way, you're going to have to have the courage to do it.  Good luck, you'll need it."

I did a 10 minute stand-up set at the Rhythm Room last night and bombed.  I decided to wing the whole thing, and it was not a good idea.  I'm going to actually rehearse my act next time and try to do a five minute set that'll kill people.  I have pages of material, but I couldn't get to it because once <lj user=""thedarkmuppet""> got on stage I got stage fright like a motherfucker.  But, at least I popped my cherry in front of a few good friends, and for that I am eternally grateful to them (<lj user=""eepthecook"">, Joe and Debbie and Bridget).  Thanks also to <lj user=""robtheslob""> for letting us crash at his place.  And thanks to <lj user=""thedarkmuppet""> and We Suck on Purpose for getting me the gig.

I don't feel as vitrolic as I once did.  Perhaps it has to do with the company I've been keeping.

My sister seems to think that I used her for money because I left when she said she wouldn't give me anymore.  Although I can see why she'd think that, I left because she and her mother wanted me to settle down.  Her mother also told me my presence was damaging the house, and I might drag my sister down to the abyss with me (her words, not mine).  If someone doesn't want me around, I'm not going to hang out just to be a glutton for punishment.  I haven't exactly been getting the hookup from anyone in particular as of late.  Just a place to crash and a bite to eat every now and again.  I've avoided my grandparents because I don't want to explain to them that I've been concentrating on writing comedy and generally trying to enjoy life.  The point is, I don't need anybody's money.  I do need money if people want to go out and do things, because gas and smokes aren't free.  Common sense.  If I had the cash, I'd cover it.  But I don't.  If I babysit your kid, don't expect me to do it for free.  If I take you to an event on the other side of town, I can't do it for free.  I just don't have the resources anymore.  I'm sorry, but that's the way it is until after Ragnarok.  Hopefully, my sister and I can touch base tomorrow and salvage our friendship, but if not, I just want my shit back.

Words have been said as of late that are making me rethink my approach to life.  I'll figure it out eventually, but right now it seems unlikely that I'll change.  

I fought all day for the first time in years on Tuesday, and I'm still sore.  Sam and I were limping around like grumpy old men after the event.  Blarg, I need to get in shape.  All the fucking I've been doing is helping.

Remember that thing I said about no more dating children?  I wasn't lying, and unfortunately someone got hurt by it.  I hope she gets over it.

"event","After the Pittsburgh trip, the week consisted of these events.

I awoke to find <lj user=""thedarkmuppet"">'s car had finally vroomed its last vroom.  So, with little Darrian asleep in my backseat, <lj user=""robtheslob""> drained the gas out of the car.  This took an hour since proper siphoning techniques were impossible due to substandard equipment.  Rob ended up cutting lines until he discovered which was the fuel line.  Rob also got really high off of gasoline, which was amusing.  Rob's hallucinitory wisdom: ""Don't forget to install an underwater camera.""  Thanks, Rob!  Rob was soo fucked up, he fell outta my car.  After some bear-driving-car hilarities (only to Darrian), I dropped everyone off and returned home, only to find Scott was bored and wanted to hang out.  

So, I drove out to Y-town and discovered that nowhere wanted to take Scott's checks and AAA will only give you enough gas to get to the next service station.  So, we put his laundry money in the tank and picked up <lj user=""thedarkmuppet""> for school.  After dropping Mr. Brett off, we went to Cici's all you can eat for four bucks pizza, which made me quite ill later.  We tinkered with the idea of visiting our old high school, and I showed Scott the new developments in our old hood.  I opted not to go to OHS with Scott in tow 'cause I was worried we'd be arrested on sight.  Considering I was enough of a threat to warrant a police investigation after I dropped out, and our shared ex was arrested right after Columbine, I thought a visit to the old stomping grounds was not the best of ideas.  

We then visited my homeboy Devin's bar in Kent.  It's called The Dome, above Desiree's right behind Topps.  Nice little Sport's Bar with potential to be a regular watering hole for me.  Cheap domestics and Karaoke makes a happy hebrew.  Hope all goes well there.  

Nothing interesting happened the next few days aside from sleeping in my car and someone who looked familiar attempting to start up a conversation with me at the Cove Tuesday night.  Note to people: I can't hear SHIT when there's loud music, so pull me aside if you want more than hand gestures and 'OKAY'.  Anyways, didn't go home much that week considering I'm pissed off at the mother of my sister for giving me the 'get stable' talk.  I don't need stability!  I need money!  That's my only motivation for employment.  So, if it's impossible to get a hold of me for a while, it's because I probably won't be home much.

So, the weekend.  After picking up Brett from the door to door thing, I stopped at home to change clothes and get money for some medicine.  I discovered said medicine is 15 bucks and I had six.  So, we went to The Dome for the GRAND OPENING EXTRAVAGANZA~! which amounted to Dev, his woman and a few of our friends.  Free hot dogs and martial arts conversation was had, and I made the bold decision to let <lj user=""thedarkmuppet""> borrow my car so I could party.  The next morning, we left for Kenderpalooza Lite(tm), a happenin' dorker party/campout being thrown by my friend Mandy.  Beer was drank, and the Church of Gnome began its REIGN OF TERROR!  Gnome decided that he was done with the inquisition trip we started on, and he wanted to go full on Jihad.  So, we strapped flour bombs to our loyal disciples and set them off on people wearing black.  It's funny if you see it.  'Specially 'cause the Drow ended up looking like he just went wading in a pile of coke.  So, aside from that and bitching at people for being pussies, the party was your normal drunken sing song and bonding that I love so much.  Gamers tend to have strong bonds because their formative years put them on an eternal quest for a new family.  It's a pity, because I've tried really hard to take them out and introduce them to the wonders of outside subcultures, but it doesn't stick.  The gamer comfort zone is a limited one, and they enjoy it, so more power to them.  But the Hotel California thing of it will never apply to me.  Anyways, I had a good time, and I look forward to the next party this weekend.  Have me car back now, so I'll be drivin' around <lj user=""robtheslob""> around today."

"event","Where I left off... oh yes.  So, we started our hard target search of Giant Eagles in a five mile radius from where we thought <lj user=""zippytpinhead""> lived.  The Giant Eagle on Shadyside actually said, ""Yeah, he works at Whole Foods down Centre Ave.""  <lj user=""robtheslob""> and I were just too stupid to realize that particular phrase meant ""Zippy doesn't work at a Giant Eagle you fucks.""  We got directions to Centre Avenue, and spent about two hours looking for it.  We stopped at about six different gas stations looking for it, but had absolutely no clue where we were going.  After finding Centre Avenue, we discovered that both locations had no idea who Zippy was.  Pissed, we drove to little Italy and called Renee.  She informed us that not only did we have the wrong address for their house, but Zippy works at Whole Foods on Centre, not Giant Eagle.  So, we went and gave Zippy big hippie hugs at work, and <lj user=""robtheslob""> frantically rushed to pay his taxes on time... which he FAILED!  If you take technology away from Generation Y, they become children again.  This is my new theory.  

So anyways, we headed back to <lj user=""fatal_dust""> for some R&R before her housewarming party.  I got some constructive sleep, and was prepared to meet cool people.  So I did.  Every one of MG's friends was a cool motherfucker, and I wouldn't mind seeing them again.  Good times were had by all, and <lj user=""fatal_dust""> earns cool points for liking Throwdown.  Big ups to Dan and Jason for wanting to play Industrial Metal, 'cause there aren't enough kids who want to play that these days.  At least not that I've seen.  Dan also turned me on to Lamb of God, who I'm looking forward to seeing live when I have the chance.  The weirdest thing ever happened that night too.  This dude Brett (who sounds exactly like my old roommate, must be the hillbilly thing) was rockin' the drumkit, and he SNAPPED the bass pedal in half.  I've seen plenty of broken heads and sticks, but never a bass pedal.  The solution was found to be taping a wrench to the pedal, and rock was had by all.  Good times.  After being the last up (what else is new, you young bucks need to learn to hold your booze), I awoke to threats of post-passout hilarity, which I responded to with threats of violation and beatings as per usual.  I wanted to get my head together and begin the cleanup process, but apparently Mary Grace wanted to show off her beautiful city to the Clevelanders in the house.  So, we attempted to follow her in her mad quest for somewhere for a double digit number of people to hang out.  After balking at the commercial temple of Station Square, we headed for a park where the MS Walk was being held.  The parking rates were re-cockulous, so we headed back to the fort to discover the parents had sojourned home early.  Dismayed, my crew of three helped clean up what we could, said our goodbyes and headed out.  I tried my best to not be a subculture kid for a minute, but I couldn't keep up the charade for very long with Zippy's punked out self standing right next to me talking about beating people with foam weapons the next day.   

So, we ventured out into the big, bad city to find some fun.  We found the Southside, and walked up and down the main drag and checked out the shops.  There was a Pitt area clothing store/headshop/adult novelty store that reminded me of Hot Topic for hipster chicks, but other than that it was your typical big city battle of hangouts vs. where the money is.  Burger Kings side by side with local deli's and all.  The closest comparison I could make is Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, except without the heroin addicts and spangers.  At least, not that day.  So, after we walked around and got all sweaty, I picked up a liberal rag to discover that the Quiet Storm had a show going on that night.  

So, we found the general area of the club (which turned out to be a coffee shop) and eventually found the place nestled in Ghetto-Fabulousness.  Hustlers tried to sell us lighters.  At least it was something I would actually buy rather than the usual cologne and incense.  I love the hustlers, but there's gotta be something else y'all can sell besides shit that makes me stink like hippies and niggers.  The Quiet Storm seemed to me like a pre-school gone wrong.  Couches and books everywhere, but the china was straight up Carol Nursery School and the art was thrown together after one too many mescaline salads.  Their coffee was bought at an increased rate from Nicaraguan farmers, which is all fine to the farmers, but the coffee smelled a little funny to me.  Apparently, the Quiet Storm is also the spot for vegan entrees in Pittsburgh.  Plus they had internet access, which made <lj user=""robtheslob""> cream his plaids.  All and all, a worthwhile stop should you ever find yourself hankering for some soup and joe in the ghetto.  We saw a bike-squatter wearing a shirt that said ""this is what a squatter looks like"" which made me chuckle.  He tried to convince us that Pizza Hut dumpsters are good for us, but I vetoed the idea.  I refuse to risk jail-time when a legal alternative is possible.  That's why I smoke Salvia Divinorum, bitch.  So, we left the Quiet Storm with no show to report because the bands broke up or something.  Pussies.  

Besides a large, black man yelling at <lj user=""robtheslob""> for sitting on the banister at Wendy's, that's all to report from the Pittsburgh trip.  Good times were had, new people were met, and Zippy's alive and well.  So all is good.  More in next article."

"event","The last week has been quite eventful.  Where do I start...

Pittsburgh is quite an interesting city.  It's like they took a million people and shoved 'em in some hills just for the fuck of it.  Then, they gave the road designers a bunch of acid and gave the drivers an IV drip of cocaine and said HAVE FUN MOTHERFUCKERS!  There are some things I like about Pittsburgh; the streets are labeled with the neighborhoods so you kind of know where you are.  I also like the fact that 'the wrong side of the tracks' applies in Pittsburgh.  One minute, you're in a nice middle-class area, the next you see homies loitering outside the check cashing place and the chinese buffets.  There are a lot of chinese buffets in Pittsburgh, as well as Giant Eagles.  I thought that since I saw a lot of people walking around, and the fact that there are a shit-ton of stairs and hills, there would be no fat people.  I was wrong.  I think I counted ten fat people over the course of the trip.  The main thing that pissed me off about Pittsburgh was the liberal rags' pleas to the city's leftist populace to turn the city into a midwest San Francisco.  Being that I spent two years in the East Bay, and I worked in the city, I'm always pissed when an area tries to be Northern California.  Pittsburgh's coming close in cigarette prices, but the idea of a steel town becoming a faux cosmopolitan mecca for faggots and homeless people makes me laugh.  It's almost as funny as Colorado trying to be the entire state of California, but that's another story.

So, <lj user=""robtheslob""> and I left the friendly confines of Akron for Pittsburgh on Thursday morning.  I discovered that I need to write down every insignificant detail of directions.  We got a little lost, but I ended up happily crashed on a bed until 3:30.  Rob and I then left on our search for <lj user=""zippytpinhead"">.  I called up my homeboy Storm, and he told us that Zippy might work at Giant Eagle.  There are eight million Big Birds in the Pitt, so the search would be long and arduous.  Plus, the only other times I had been to Pittsburgh I hung out on Forbes and Carnegie Mellon.  So, with no idea where we were headed, we began our search of Giant Eagles.  

More to the story later, I'm beat."

"event","<lj user=""thedarkmuppet""> has his license back!  Finally!  Best news of the day.  Digger apparently gave <lj user=""robtheslob""> pink eye.  To make matters worse, my cat has decided to be a bad houseguest everywhere I take her.  She's only been good at Brian and Leigh's back in Colorado.  My options at this moment are to take her to the APL, let her loose where there's some prey for her or kill her.  Apparently, keeping her in the car would be grounds for my arrest.  So, unless I come up with a bright idea, we're headed to the APL later today.  I thought she'd calm down after being around familiar faces, but I was wrong.  So, there's no way I can keep her around anymore.  I think she just misses Nagumi, her lesbian lover.  She was so damned docile around that cat, and now she's back to behaving like a kitten.  There's just no way around it; I can't keep her.  I'm bumming, especially since I thought I made a breakthrough in thought processes tonight at the club.  It seems to me that I've been looking at all the wrong things when trying to get an idea of how people behave.  I've been looking for a general idea and have been getting generalizations.  I think I need to actually... be social and stop observing in order to get a better idea of how people act.  It's annoying, since I really don't have much to say.  But, it must be done.  I've got to get a better idea of how people work so I can better function in society.  This lone wolf intellectual bullshit isn't paying the bills.  My old roommate and I were discussing the tendency of psychology to judge happiness by how well people can behave in society.  We both feel this idea is bullshit, but if it's the norm, I have to learn how it's possible."

Forty-two grams of white wine will age two minutes in two years for balance.  The only reason for this is Jen likes her peeps aged two years.  The things I do for my friends.

My attempt at art failed so now I AM THE ART!

Common Grounds had the international dork out going on tonight, so we left.  Nothing says 'I've got the geek' like magic cards and coffee.  Well, except maybe playing magic cards on a laptop.

We leave soon to wander the streets of Little Italy for no reason.  Or maybe there is a reason.  You never know with these things.

If anyone with artistic talent wants to help me with a little project involving electing a demon to the white house, let me know.  I have a plan to turn George Bush into a tentacle rape monster through the use of a band.  It will involve the band's street team using the symbol for said demon as their banner and flyer image, then an elite task force will be dispatched to place the sigil in greeting cards through the use of post-it notes.  Remember, a bored jew plots for evil.

'Mister Bush, what are your plans for Iraq?'  'RAPE!'

You know it's funny, fuck you.

This is why I don't drink coffee.

I will now rape <lj user=""robtheslob""> because he is a waffling motherfucker and he wants me to make plans.  

My cat is now happily relocated.  She still misses her lesbian lover, who I assume is missing in the wilds of Fort Collins, CO... or dead.  Pity, I really liked that cat.

"event","I decided today was as good a day as any to check out Akron's spot for live music, The Lime Spider.  Rob the Slob and I made the trek and I can definitely say it was worth it.  Digger kicked some ass, and I'm sure the Cruiserweights and Feable Weiner will be making some noise in the future.  The last band... well... they sucked balls.  As soon as they figure out what the hell they are trying to be, I'm sure they'll be quite alright.  I'm submitting a full review of the show to a few local rags to see if I can make this a steady gig.  I love doing show reviews, in fact I used to do it for pro-wrestling on a regular basis.  Set up a myspace account today just for the hell of it.  Alterior motive for setting up a myspace account was to see if I could find a couple people that have dropped off the face of the earth, but unfortunately was unable to find them.  Can't wait to go on the Pittsburgh trip, just for the change of scenery.  It seems I can't stay in one place too long, or I'll go quite batty.  I guess I shouldn't be looking for any permanent living arrangements if that's the case.  I just need a place to keep my clothes and my books.  My bro's got his eye on my CDs, and hopefully he's enjoying them.  Digger is passed out, but Rob the Slob's snoring is probably going to prompt a beating in the morning.  One can only hope.  He was too lazy to move the one foot from the couch to the bed which he claims prevents him from snoring.  I guess that's why he calls himself the slob, even though everyone in Colorado knows him as ""the Job"".  Pabst Blue Ribbon 40's are the greatest thing ever.  You can be white trash and ghetto at the same time.  Easter is here, and I still think Jesus was better off dead.  Less corruption in the world that way.  Think I'm gonna pop a pill and pass out on Rob's bed in a few-I've gotta be in Akron at 1:00 for Easter.  I don't wanna be the guy that makes lunch run late; that's my uncle Bill's job."

"event","I drive a lot.  It's like my communion with God every time I see a stretch of the open road in front of me.  Doesn't matter why I'm driving, I just love to do it.  Somedays, I just drive out to Jabumfuck, Nowhere just so I can say I've been there.  If my life consisted of nothing but driving, eating and fucking, I'd be set.  As long as I've got tapes and smokes, I'll be content.  That's why I appreciate things like when my crew helps me out with maintenance/repairs.  Rob the Job offered to foot the bill for fixing my brakes, and we spent three hours learning the ins and outs of brake repair while my black manservant's woman held the nuts.  For those interested, here are the materials needed for disk brake repair on a 1996 Buick Skylark:

4 Brake Pads (est. 20$)
2 Rotors (est. 40$)
Brake Cleaner (est. 2$)
Large Allen Wrench 
Tire Iron
Hydraulic Jack
Mountain Dew
Smokes
Halogen Light

I never knew a jack could be used for loosening nuts before today.  I also never knew that a rotor could look so horrible after two months of no brake pads.  This is shit I couldn't learn in college.  I also learned that Dove works as well as Gojo when hot water is involved.

We also had the 'FUCK YOU ATKINS, WE LIKE OUR CARBS!' dinner at the tubby wonder's place.  Fettucine Alfredo, mashed potatoes a la Slob and garlic bread were had by all and we got fat and sassy.  Unfortunately, it's very difficult to find a bottle of Sherry in Y-Town at 11:00 at night.  Live and learn.  In Colorado, liquor stores would have been available to fufill our cooking wine needs before midnight.  I guess those blue laws have an advantage after all.

"event","So I ran by my sister's job the other day to get bitched at, and I picked up a Charles Bukowski poetry book.  Man, anything can get published if you've got the rep.  A bunch of drunken ramblings organized all pretty somehow equates to marketable poetry.  Fuck man, I gotta get an agent.  I've got shit written down from the past few years that I could make all pretty.  But, I think I'd rather do some serious writing.  Problem is, I need to get a fuckin' crunch time to bring out the best in me.  The best work I've ever done has been done three hours before a due date.  Somehow, adversity brings out the best in me.  I don't know why; I hate the shit with a passion.  Stress blows ass and makes me shove shit up my nose and in me hash pipe.  I dunno, mate.  Mebbe I just need the occasional kick in the arse to give me that extra motivation.  Or in some cases, a punch in the jaw to remind me that people have feelings and won't understand my stabs at humour.  

Speaking of humour, stand up kicked some ass tonight.  There was Steve the Brit (dunno his last name) headlining, and the whole act, he had the whole club rolling on the floor laughing their asses off.  If you abbreviate that last phrase, you're a nerd.  Contrary to popular belief, IM talk is not cool.  It means you can't type worth a shit and you're lazy.  And probably indicates a lack of anything witty to say.  So where was I, oh yes, british guy.  He did this whole routine based on staring at Rob's crotch and talking about his nuts.  Something about a man-cooch or whatever.  It was made infinitely more funny to me 'cause Rob always bitches about lack of room in the nethereigons.  Motherfucker just needs new pants.  When I shop for pants, crotch room usually comes before anything else.  Fuck if they're covered in shit stains and smell like your grandma's cunt, at least my cockenballs have room to sway in the breeze.  All you Akron motherfuckers that I know have gotta come down next week (I tried callin' all yous bitches) or I'm giving up and not telling you where the cool kids are anymore.  

Need to find a part time job.  It'll be in the agenda week after next.  No more holiday and extended revelry plans, so no reason not to work.  I mean, I've floated by without work the last few months and that Judeo-Christian guilt is starting to kick in thanks to the disapproving stares of my fellows, and the fact that the most pathetic motherfuckers I knew back in the day have settled down and are working a nine to five.  But fuck 'em, they're still dorks.  Yeah, rambling.  Don't really give a fuck.  If Chucky B. can pull it off, so can I.  

Everybody snores like a motherfucker.  'Specially after a couple buckets of Michael Sheas and a few pitchers of Punks Buy Ratpiss.  Some dude at Stand Up was talkin' about how his boy has a Pabst tattoo.  Shit, I've got tattooed fingers, and I'm less likely to be called white trash than that motherfucker.  I still want PBR condoms, though.  It would explain to my bitches why the breath is kickin' when we're getting down to business.  And nothing says 'you're a whore' more than being fucked in the ass by a red, white and blue condom.  'Cept maybe just getting fucked in the ass to begin with.  I don't get why women like that shit.  We dread going to the urologist cause the dude sticks a couple fingers up there to check the old milk-machine.  Maybe y'all got some sort of reverse Linda Lovelace shit going on.  Gotta kick the cheezy music when I'm doin' the deed next time.  Maybe it'll make me feel better about it.  

Yeah, so back to Stand Up, motherfucker I don't usually find that funny actually got a couple good swings at me tonight, so he's redeemed.  I'm all about the crackin', 'specially when someone can dish it out and not make me shake my head in pity.  Although, as a result of said crackin', I'm probably gonna be the blind vampire homo for the rest of me days in Lakewood, OH.  But fuck it, if goth faggots wanna buy me a beer, I ain't gonna complain.  

Yeah, so I've realized my tolerance to percosets is through the roof thanks to my abuse of said pharmaceutical in Colorado.  I blame a party I attended a while back where two people featured in Rolling Stone made an appearance and said they'd hop a train out to see me.  I wish Johnny and Heather would have, 'cause we coulda milked their celebrity for a few free rounds at Garageland or something.  Either that, or some little squatter kid woulda started a fight.  Either way, I'd be gettin' fucked up.  

Speaking of gettin' fucked up, one of my Akron dorks might be managing a bar at the geodesic dome in Kent.  1.50 bottles.  Can't go wrong with that.  When I remember the name of the place, and find out if he got the job, I'll post it.  Show up and drink.  Can't go wrong for a buck fitty bottles 'cause the motherfuckin' Black Label ain't bottled.  Word.  Aside from drinking someone's spit cup and eating out a bitch on the rag, I can't think of anything more vile than slamming down a can of the ol' Black Label.  Okay, maybe indulging in those sick foreign sexual escapades all the kids keep telling me about.  I'm sorry, but if you're still amused by shit, keep it at frats and on the internet, where I won't go.  Fuckin' internet... it's made sexual deviants feel normal... which is WRONG!  You SHOULD be ashamed if you enjoy jerking off to Garfield banging My Little Pony!  Price you pay for living in a free country, I guess.  At least I can still call people niggers without going to jail.  Maybe not without being shot, but what's a little lead between brothers, eh?  

So yeah, stream of consciousness writing is fun.  I should be one of those laptop carrying motherfuckers in the coffee shops who just types away all day and looks at people having way more fun than he is.  Then I could really be a dork.  I remember when my life could be hunky dory just by gaming every fucking day and smelling like the ass end of a cat with distemper.  I don't miss it, just saying I remember.  Of course, you ask anyone who knows me, and I still stink like a construction worker after workin' all day in Nevada, but fuck 'em.  Everybody has their 'not so fresh' days.  That's why Allah gave us Old Spice and breath mints.  If it wasn't for the fact that the majority of cheap breath mints contain the dreaded Aspartame, I'd be chewin' on those motherfuckers non-stop.  

Speaking of Aspartame, I hear there's no conclusive evidence that the shit causes similar symptoms to Multiple Sclerosis.  Alls I've got are case studies and proof of the existance of Nutra Sweet detox centers.  It's just like caffeine.  Once you start, you can't stop using it.  Everything with sugar tastes too sweet (soda and tea wise) and you get a jones for it that's harder to quit than oral sex.  Luckily, I kicked the habit when I was 10 and figured out why the fuck my head was hurtin' all the time.  See, back in the days when I lived in the faux-hebrew neighborhood of Pepper Pike (I say faux hebrew 'cause school felt like everyone had a bar-mitzvah but all the houses were owned by old Christians), my family was the lucky recipient of a hundred pack of Diet Pepsi.  So naturally, we all drank Diet Pepsi like a motherfucker.  Orange juice?  Costs money, nigger, have a can of 'uh huh'.  I started to see a neurologist for migranes half-way through the case.  See, I drank all the shit 'cause my parents were avid Diet Coke drinkers (I love the Kamakaze Copilots for their song 'My Mom's Addicted to Diet Coke' see those kids if they're still in Fort Fun) and my sisters were not feeling fat and sassy enough to enjoy the bland, bland taste of the right one, baybee.  A year of blood thinners that gave me seizures and useless MRI's made me think that maybe all the Nutra Sweet I was ingesting MIGHT be a bad thing.  Sure enough, no more migranes until a freak microscope accident in No-Colorado made them come back with a vengance.  And by then, the joys of narcotics and herbal therapy made the need for a neurologist naught.  

Yeah, herbal therapy.  I don't understand that lifestyle anymore.  I used to, but the need for an active, social lifestyle has replaced the need to sit on the couch, dork out on games and movies and munch Cool Ranch Doritos like a 400 pound welfare momma with a goiter.  Fuckin's a lot more fun stoned, 'cause the shit you think of during sex is funny as hell.  So if I've ever been fuckin' around with any of y'all reading this, and I start crackin' up like a motherfucker, it's not because I think your twat looks like a hot pocket and the noises you're makin' sound like some Jap geisha in a Aniporn, wait, it prolly is.  Nevermind.  Anyways, I think the lure of marijuana for me at one point was the fact that like the motherfucking lead singer of the News said, ""I want a new drug.""  I had caffeine to keep me awake for hours on end, discussing plans of world domination and future sexual exploits that would never come to fruition because no motherfucker sitting in an Arabica has ever done shit but win a game of chess against an art-fag chick from Little Italy while sitting at an Arabica.  Or Risk.  I also had nicotine, to keep me looking forward to that next blissful moment when I didn't feel like strangling the nearest person or my penis.  Yes, smoking keeps me from masturbating.  I'm guessing if you smoke, it's the same case with you.  Deal with it.  Freud said so, so it must be true.  Freud also painted the inside of his nostrils with coke instead of fuckin' snorting it like any good, honest man does so fuck 'im.  So, I had these two lovely substances, but I didn't really have anything to make me want to do absolutely nothing and be happy with it.  So, I started rockin' the ganj.  If you've ever had a shitty boss, a shitty car, a shitty girlfriend and a shitty... everything, the pot can make it all go away... for the few hours you're baked.  Then, it's the grind again 'till the bowl is passed your way.  I can see why people still smoke pot.  It makes their incredibly shitty lives seem manageable for a time.  Then, you grow the fuck up and do a line with the big boys.  That's what the theory says, anyways.  

I don't believe marijuana is a gateway drug.  I mean, the only thing it's a gateway to is a severe Cool Ranch Dorito craving and a bank account in the red due to bounced checks written for beef jerky nuggets and teriyaki chicken sandwiches.  I suppose it could be a gateway to diet pills, but that's for you insecure motherfuckers who don't worship every fuckin' globule of fat on your ass like I do.  I love my fat ass.  If I didn't have it, I'd never be able to write a word.  I can't walk around and write; I need my ass.  So yeah, gateway drug.  I know people that would drink a lot, then want to smoke a bowl, then want to do some coke, then do some meth, then shoot up, then go start a fight to get more money to get more shit.  I don't get those people at all.  If you can't enjoy the buzz you've got, you shouldna started doin' the shit in the first place.  

I also don't understand this shit I heard on the radio earlier today.  It was an alt-country sounding rhythm in the guitars with an R&B drumbeat.  What the fuck?  Pick a style, motherfucker!  Quit confusing my ass.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to get jiggy with it or fuck a sheep.  

Speaking of animal buggery, do breathe right strips work?  'Cause Rob the Slob snores like a beast.  Not the original beast, Johnny P.  but close enough.  I'll go steal a case for the motherfucker in case I'm up typin' on the live-journal at his bachelor pad.  Speaking of bachelor, I've come to the conclusion that if you're female and haven't fucked Robby Jr., I have absolutely no idea if you're going to be cool when I meet you.  So, if you wanna be cool, fuck Rob the Slob.  

Another message to ladies, SHAVE YOUR FUCKIN' BUSH IF YOU WANT ORAL SEX!  It's hard enough to find the man in the boat without a forest to weave through.  I'm sick of women bitching at me that they never get head when they don't have the courtesy to shave that shit.  Hell, if I can do it, so can you.  And I'm concerned that smiling makes me look gay, for fuck's sake.  No, it's true.  I think my homophobia is directly responsible for my constant look of utter disinterest.  That, or the stick in my ass.  Could be both, but I ain't gettin' rid of the stick.  Nothin' says lovin' like beating someone with a stick that smells like open ass.  Except beating someone with an old fish, but I ain't carryin' that around.  

Yeah.  So, I'm still not tired even though all the shit I do to fall asleep has been done.  Remember kids, chewing a painkiller makes it work faster.  No more migraine for me.  I want to find a club where they don't have flashing lights all over the place.  Then I'll be happy, and maybe able to dance without the aid of some sort of nose candy.  Or ecstacy.  That shit is not all it's cracked up to be.  This kid I used to hang out with said he used to do some E then drink a lot of water so he orgazmed whenever he peed.  Fucked up kid.  Perhaps that's why I don't hang out with him anymore.  Free spanking from Eep, the wonder monkey bitch if you can guess who that kid is.  Coupon is non-transferrable.  

Speaking of ecstacy, I'm sick of people doing drugs just so they feel like a little baby getting its ass wiped every time someone rubs up against them on their way to the pisser.  If you need to be touched, rub your ass in someone's crotch like every other fag still stuck in that 'touch me so I feel loved' phase of life.  Shit, they got drugs for everything these days.  I want to find a drug that brings me the joy I had when I felt holier than thou for bitching out my hippie mom when my crew found her roach bag.  Nothing beats the feeling of being better than your parents.  Except maybe fucking a sheep.  Damn country music...   Yeah.  So this shit is way too long an I ain't tired, so I'm gonna go read news articles until the boredom lulls me to sleep.  More to come."

"event","My old roommate had three heart attacks and survived.  Good fuckin' deal.  We had a long conversation about psychology and philosophy that caused me to rethink my position on behavioral psychology.  See, I realized my main problem with Skinner is that his school of thought really doesn't work in a clinical setting, but that doesn't mean I can write him off completely.  I mean, we do replay old tapes in our head whenever we head into a familiar situation.  The problem is, how do we write over our old tapes so we can change how we react?  Slipping into someone else's belief system helps a lot, but one can only fight biology for so long.  Homeboy's on the more 'Universal Unknowable Truth' kick while I tried to explain that there is no truth.  Don't think we're going to convince each other on that one.  Platonic ideals are hard to crush. 

I realized that love is like a drug to me.  When I'm happily involved, I'm clean and sober, and usually have some sense of purpose.  Not any more.  The shit replaces any emotional high I ever got, and does it better.  Only problem is, drugs don't really give me a sense of purpose, but perhaps I shouldn't even be looking for that at all.  I should just be looking for new experiences and modes of thought.  The goth scene leads to some interesting opportunities for new points of view, but looking at them, it's the same old story.  Confused kids find comfort in black clothing and bad dancing, and don't grow until they find someone comfortable who can show them a whole new world they never saw beyond the Chamber.  They're like punks, only with more estrogen and less violence.  Kinda boring.  I might pass on this one.

Not much to do on a Sunday night, but I didn't expect anything really.  When you're broke, there isn't much to do anyway.  Good shit costs money.

Dana Carvey is not funny at all.  He had good writers on SNL; his movies all suck fat donkey cock.  Master of Disguise was the biggest waste of my time ever.  And I once sat in front of a TV watching an animated loop clutching a spoon with a soup bowl on my head for three hours.

We might have to rethink the study of psychology.  Every discipline seems to be concerned with how a person is able to function in society rather than if that person is truly happy.  Perhaps if we can encourage someone to go with their genetic pre-dispositions, they will be more likely to be happy.  

Anti-depressants are actually kind of fun.  It's like the mental high of marijuana in small doses.  I couldn't function on them all the time, so no scrips for me.

Music critics are ten times better in Cleveland than in Colorado.  I think the guys around here just are more willing to dork out and listen to absolutely everything.  No problems with that.

People wonder how is it that people fall out of love.  I don't think they ever do.  You can love someone and not like them one bit.  It's more conducive to a good relationship if you like the person you're with.

My live journal is now reading like a Ross Report.  I feel like a hack.  Blarg."

"event","I'm starting to settle into my surroundings here in Cleveland.  I should have a job within the week.  Lots of little differences between here and Colorado.  Mostly in attitude.  Coloradoans feel entitled to be happy, while Clevelanders have a very Jewish 'life is hell' kind of attitude.  Been hanging out with my niece a lot, and I'm continuing to learn about how human thought is shaped throughout the years.  It's kind of neat actually experiencing it rather than just reading about it.  I think that people are irritated with my cold, intellectual approach to things.  I'm just irritated with my lack of grammar and shit when I just woke up a few hours ago.  I'm still perplexed by the notion that 'any attention is good attention'.  I can't figure out when that idea starts out in people, since the two year old I had contact with seems to have a little of this idea, and the four year old definitely does.  It's unfortunate that this idea starts this early.  It seems impossible to get rid of if it's so deeply ingrained.  I'm working with the theory that this weaker mankind we seem to be cursed with the past few hundred years has it ingrained in there psyche or something.  Even more reason to live outside the box.  Back to sleep for tomorrow I find work."

"event","I'm moving back to Cleveland tonight, and I've been taking stock of the events and revelations that have lead me to the decision to leave Colorado for good.  Here are a few:

1) Dropped out of college.

I can't study things that I don't find the least bit useful.  It took me four failed tours of college to figure this out, but this time it stuck.  There will be no time for me to re-enter the educational system; there will be no time for self improvement at 4K a year.  I'm done.  Time to find something else to do with my life.

2) My discovery of Chaos Magick.

During the course of my magickal research, I discovered this system, and I became intrigued by it.  Random belief structures especially interested me.  Instead of forging 'random' belief structures, I began to mirror those of people in my life.  It gave me a better understanding of pretty much everyone I know.  Especially enlightening was my time spent as a white supremacist, which truly let me 'know my enemy' as it was.  Not having any beliefs is quite liberating, and I shall continue to use this system for the rest of my days.

3) Fired twice for missing work on Pagan holidays.

I learned an important lesson about the nature of faith here.  If you think you need a day off, and you don't take it, bad shit happens.  Case in point, I ended up passing out for multiple days on both Beltaine and Samhain because I blew my wad trying to stay up for work.  I'm not going to over-exert myself like that again.

4) The Starlight.

Many things in conjunction with what I once called my 'second home' happened.  First off, almost everyone I was cool with at the bar either got fired or quit.  Second, I was branded a Nazi (this may have been the impetus for my 'white power' phase) for my rendition of an Alice Cooper song at Karaoke.  This made me persona non grata thanks to my association with several ex-Nazis in town.  Third, I rejected advances by patrons and employees of said bar constantly, which led to some resentment.  Fourth, I ended up too fucked up to move on several occasions which led to the watering down of my drinks, and less tolerance of my dance-floor behavior.  Fifth, someone made a remark in passing about my lack of strength post-breakup.  In retrospect, I spent the rest of the year trying and failing to prove this person wrong.  I did have a lack of strength, and it took a full descent (or ascent if it suits you) into nihilism to bring me out of it.  Sixth, I discovered no new bands at the Starlight.  Except the Queefs.  My Cunt Tastes Like Your Boyfriend's Cock is the most ingenious song title ever.  There were more things that happened there, but I can't recall them well enough to put them on my computer screen.

5) The Pilot

I thought I might be able to forge a quasi-relationship with someone this year, and I thought wrong.  Instead of gaining anything except a few hours of good times and a tire, I lost a close friend and the respect of a lot of people.  Lesson learned, no more children (mentally).  I realize this rules out 75 percent of the female population that can actually give me an erection, but oh fucking well.  It ain't worth it.

6) Mirror Mirror

I saw a lot of me in other people this year, and I realized that a lot of the things I blamed on other people (parents, society, friends) were MY fault.  A big fucking Mea Culpa won't solve anything, so I just learned not to tolerate these behaviors any more.  Cases in point: No more relying on alcohol for ANYTHING, no more looking at the Y chromosome for sexual fufillment, no more blowing huge wads of cash on food in lieu of bills, no more depending on anyone out of habit, no more expecting something in return, no more fanatical devotion to a cause, no more relying on magic and psychic ability to get by, no more relying on attraction to gain favor from others (I know, those of you who know me are puzzled at this one, but trust me, I've done it and I'm sorry), no more killing the pain of life with anything but hard work and support, no more letting anyone walk all over me, no more hatred (contempt and disappointment only), no more laying it all on the table for those who don't want to hear it, no more using my problems as an excuse for all my mistakes, no more settling for less, no more pipe dreams as smoke and mirrors for my real goals, no more classifications, no more rebellion for the purpose of rebellion, no more feeling sorry for myself, no more fishing for pity, no more letting people in and slamming the door on their head, no more running from my problems, no more complacency and no more fast food.  Thanks to you people who helped me see the log in my eye.

7) Perserverance.

I drew paralells between this album and my own life, and it started to get my blood pumping again.  It may sound corny, but Hatebreed might have pushed me out of the gutter.  Blood For Blood did it for me once, but White Trash Rob can't stomach the fact that once upwardly-mobile, ex-suburbanites can relate to his lyrics.

8) Names

I recently discovered that the only thing classification does is trap whatever you just labeled into never becoming anything more than what it is defined as.  In that respect, names are not a tool of self-improvement.  So I'm done trying to figure out WHAT I am, I'm just going to be busy being.

9) Writer's Block

I haven't done shit other than this in terms of writing in a while.  Hopefully, this opens the floodgates.  Hopefully, someone will read this and get inspired.  After all, what else is the point of publishing?

Later."

"event","For those of you that weren't there.

Hot Buttery Lovin' - Anal Sex.  When lubrication is a must, and butter's all you have, it's all good.  Or so it would seem when talking to some people.  

Pull Starting - Yanking anal beads out in one tug.  It results in blood and shit covering your walls, and probably an end to your sexual escapades with whatever bitch you try this on.

The Milk - Bovine Growth Hormone works on humans.  It's true.

Getting a Badge - Get someone in the Kingdom of Mordor high and they MIGHT tell you what this one means.

Abstract Art - Semen.  This comes from an incident at an Applebees where Little Jeremy happened to put an impressive stain on his napkin with coffee creamer.  It looked like Abstract Art to him.  Looked like jizz to me.

Gargoyle - Any beer wench that takes more than one minute to make eye contact.

Coffee Shop Revolutionary - Someone who has a bunch of ideas, but is too busy sitting on their ass in a fucking coffee shop to put any of them into action.  Also, anyone who has an anarchy symbol on their person and has never committed a crime.

Chalupa - Bleeding dog pussy.  Courtesy of Puff {PiG}

More to come when I feel like it."

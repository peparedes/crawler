"event","I don't know what do with myself right now! haha. I have no homework because of the snow day. This is weird, I've never felt so free of shit to do in awhile!

Tonight involves NOTHING. I MAY practice a little piano and solfege, but that's the lenght of work I'm doing! 

I skipped solfege this morning because Robbins cancelled Group Vocal Techniques and it just seemed pointless to walk all the way to the con and have to walk ALLLLL the way back. Plus, I knew we wouldn't be doing a whole lot in solfege anyways. 

Tonight I'm going to Starbucks after work with the sarahs and brandon, followed by some much anticipated Grey's Anatomy. Then it is to the gym! I leave for Miami in TWO and half weeks folks, and I haven't been the gym in exactly one week. hah. So I think it's about time I get there. 

Valentine's Day was cute I guess. Sarah and I went to cornerstone for dinner. I'm poor so I had to get an appitizer hah. After dinner we went over to Book and Bean for coffee and a muffin. Then it was time for a mad search for my phone. INSANITY. I looked EVERYWHERE and no phone. 

Luckily this morning I decided to give one last good look in my car and i found it in between the backseat and the door. How it didn't fall out, I don't know. 


RARRRRR I can't stop thinking of Miami. I NEED a vacation right now. I came to this conclusion when I realized I have lost and found everything valuable in my life this week, which a clear sign my brain is not function properly. I lost my wallet and keys on tuesday, then my phone yesterday. My mom said it's me subconsiously mourning grams. Which I'm sure is true. Every so often she will just randomly pop into my head. I still can't even get over that she's gone. 

MMkay, it's time for some choir :( and then work :( :("

"event","I can't believe how just plain ugly people can be to one another.


I am overwhelmed about everything. And everything means nothing.

I'm overwhelmed about the amount I have learned about myself and life in general since the 6 months I've been here. 

I'm singing ""Hills of Home"" in my voice lessons and it's weird, because it's like Ms. Ginn secretly knows what's going on in my life and picks songs accordingly. It really freaks me out sometimes. Ms. Ginn is fierce. The following people in my life are fierce: my parents, Prof. Robbins, Prof. Joss, Ms. Ginn. That's honestly about it. And hopefully someday I can be added to a list of fierce people. 

For the first time ALL year, I am homesick. Homesick for my family, homesick for my high school friends, homesick for my carpie friends, homesick for howland in general. 

I guess you could say I'm getting really sick and tired of being talked to like I'm two years old. You know, this is a time when I really need someone to be there for me, not criticize my every move. I can only take so much of that. 

I applied for a position at the Summer Music Camp here at BW. Let's see if I get it. I think I've made my decision about the camp naz dilema, and I've decided it's best I not work there. I could see more ugliness come out of that as well. And right now I'm making a consious effort to get rid of the ugly in my life and focus my energy into my goals."

"event","Everyone say a prayer that Brookpark Elementary closes tomorrow for the temp.. I REALLLYYY just don't want to do this field experience stuff. I shouldn't complain, because that class is the reason I am allowed to have a car at BW for the rest of the semester!!

I feel bad for bringing this back; I never use it EVERRR.


Basically:

February is already a MUCH better month than January. So far, no deaths, no more professors are leaving, and other thingsss..

I'm still really upset Prof. Robbins is leaving.. reallly upset. I'm going to miss her SOOO much!!!


Country is music is growing on me more these days.. my Ohio side is really starting to show.


I hope Megan and Mario come to BW.. it will just be nice to have some Howland faces around here. I won't lie, I get a little jealous of the Kent and OSU crew. 

It was nice seeing some high school buds Friday night.. too bad it was because of such a sad event. 


Homeworkkk timeee ya'll"

"event","Being back at school is mucho awesome.

Classes aren't too bad at all. Dev. Psych is going to be decent, Education of Chidren with Special Needs will be boring and annoying, and English is insanely easy. There is no reason I should be in that class. I was one point away on my ACT from not having to take that class. Yesterday we learned about the paragraph and what a topic sentence is...


Music classes are music classes. LOVE LOVE LOVE Group Vocal Techniques. The new Solfege class is pretty scary but I think I'll manage to get through it. All my other general music core classes are the same and going well. I'm off to my first voice lesson of the semester which scares me. Blah I really don't want to go. 

More updates to come..."

This afternoon we found out my grandma passed away. She was in PA visiting my uncle for Russian Christmas and this afternoon she went to take a nap and never woke up.

When my mom first told me I didn't know what to think or do. It was SUCH a shock. 

When I was younger she was my idol. She taught me Slovak, how to sing all kinds of crazy slovak folk and drinking songs, and I used to bake and cook with her all the time. When I was older she and I weren't quite as close. But I still always felt like I was the special grandchild. 

It's all still a huge shock. She was pretty kick ass. She will be greatly missed and I just really hope she knows that.

Leaving for Binghamton, NY Friday morning. Just my mom and I, to meet with my Aunt and Uncle. I'm just going to drive her. She's really upset."

"event","I mean, I won't lie, I'm pretty hurt.

And just confused.

But when it comes down to it, I really can't be mad... or can I? I mean, I feel like you shouldn't be mad at someone if they don't feel the same way. But at the time, it just plain sucks.

I'm done for awhile. Done dating, done looking, done in general. It's my turn for that special someone to come to me, right? I've been screwed over too much to go through it again. Note: I realize this isn't the last time this will happen to me, but I'm going to do all I can to prevent it.

I think I'm to blame in many respects to.

But right now I'd rather not think too deeply about it. I want to get back to school. I'm sick of being home now. The first week of break was amazing then it just went way down hill. I just wanna head back. And get my life back to normal."

"event","Uhm, bored.

I worked at the YMCA this morning. I was suppose to go in at 8 and I didn't get there till about 9 oops. Oh well. So worked 9-12.. easy shift hah. I read both my Music Educator magazines. I really miss having a real job. My work study just doesnt cut it. But maybe now that I'm working for Professor Joss as her course assistant I'll make a little extra money. 

I forgot how ignorant the public is. This like, middle-aged douche comes up to me and is like, ""yah know that second step is cracked. make sure you put that in your little report."" I just rolled my eyes. haha. What is this magical report that I write? And does this man not realize he's in the YMCA of Trumbull County.. the cheapest Y of them all? Lifeguarding is so boring.

I need to find a waitering job this summer.

I miss school, I won't lie. It's been great here, but I miss being on my own. If only I could bring my car back to school with me. 

Choir rehearsal for the wedding tonight, thennn? I donno. I hopefully I get some calls."

"event","So I am back in live journal world.

I missed it, honestly. 

Break has been amazing. Without a doubt, my best winter break ever. Bani's the other night was so much fun. I really do miss everyone from home even though I may act like I don't. 


I've been hanging out a lot w/Richard. And it's been awesome. He is a great guy. 

So it's christmas eve and I have a 102 fever! Tonsilitis. I hate it. I've been in bed all day. And my fever will not break. I watched all of season 3 of Will & Grace. Hopefully tomorrow I'll be better!

So I'm terrified of next semester. haha. Oh well. I'm taking Group Vocal Techniques with Robbins though and that'll be a great class. Cannot wait. Developemental Psych and Teaching Special Needs are NOT on my list of favs for this semester.


I need to get to bed. It's nice to be back in LJ world."

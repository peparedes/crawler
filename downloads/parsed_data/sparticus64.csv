"event","I just got back from the store.  What a push and shove.  I do believe it is the holiday season.

I cant wait for Wednesday, I dont have to work and I think I will go snowboarding at mount baker.

The 19th I went out to the bar with some friend that I havent seen in along time.  I must have had like 10 shots of tiquiala and 6 beers.  Best part is after all that I didnt feel drunk or sick.  And no hang over the next day."

"event","I am so bored............................

I found my dads pool Q and started to drive to the bar, called everyone to see if they would like to pay some pool.  Not one of them.  Some were not home or not picking up the cell, others were watching the football game.  Guess thats not saying alot.  I didnt call alot of people, but I really cant call alot of people, cuz I dont know alot.

I need to get more friends.  Ones that would like to do stuff, and would call me if they were going to do something that they think I would want to do.  Even if I didnt want to do it they would call.

All I really wanted to do today was spend sometime with someone.  I have game systems, and games to keep me from getting bored.  I guess I need a girlfriend.  I never really tried to get one, but I should start to think about it.  Or at least get a friend that is a girl.  Well I know some females, but I work or worked with them and they were all around my moms age, so they dont count.

I really want some one that would like to go hiking, swimming, mountain biking, snowboarding, camping, some one that would like to go on walks in the park or something.  I just need some one that I could spend more time with.  But I already know I will have troubles with that sort of thing.

Its not like I have never been on a date.  I have.  I am just really shy.  Really shy.  I was on a date with a girl that was going to be a model.  Well I guess she was, she did a photo shoot for Star Bucks Coffie.  She was pretty and I told her that.  Well I said she looked really good.  We met at the movies, and the hole time she would brush up agianst me.  Like I said I am really shy.  I did nothing.  I should have, thats life.  I even went to dinner with one of the cheer leaders from my high school.  We talked and had fun I thought.  That one is kind of my falt that it never went anywhere.  Her farther was one of the owners of the company I work for, and I didnt want him or his wife that work at the company on my bad side.  Other then those 2 I have been on 3 other dates that faild, or I thought think they were dates and the other person would say other wise.

Thats all I really want to say."

"event","I was getting on I-5 and there was a truck so I passed it, and the cop behind the truck pulled me over.  I didnt get a ticked but he said ""I see u live in Marysville.  I do to and I will see you around"".  And I know he will see me around, my car is really modded.

So do u think he was trying to scare me and doesnt live in marysville?

On a good note I just found out that its not to expensive to go sky diving.  I was told 150.  I that good?   Well it dont really matter right know, I will be going in the spring.  For now its all about going snowboarding.

I went to the bar after work with friends and it was all good till I tryied to order a drink.  Well they didnt know how to make it so I left and went to a differend one later on with a friend.  It was pretty cool with the live DJ till a group of people started to fight.  There was like 8 or more people total, but I wasnt even watching them.  There was 2 guy fighting like little girls, open handed hair pulling and all.  I couldnt stop laughing my ass off.  To bad there is a cop shop like a block away."

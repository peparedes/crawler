"event","i began to take antidepressants about 3 months ago.&nbsp; i've been battling my usual enemy:&nbsp;apathy.&nbsp; i sink in and out of it.&nbsp; the antidepressants make it easier to have a thick skin at work, which i need, but they make life more meaningless.&nbsp; sometimes it doesn't matter, because i just get shit done, without thinking about it.&nbsp; much gets accomplished and i feel satisfied.&nbsp; i laugh a lot.&nbsp; but sometimes it's all so meaningless. for example, yesterday i got dressed to go for a run, i began to stretch, but then i lied down on my floor and went to sleep for 3 hours. because i stopped caring.&nbsp; then i got up, went for a walk, and felt terribly numb.&nbsp; and then i went back to sleep.&nbsp; i used to feel deep pain in my soul when i hurt somebody's feelings.&nbsp; so i would apologize.&nbsp; and then i would feel relief.&nbsp; and my relationships flourished.&nbsp; now i think the antidepressants block that pain of life, and i don't care how other people feel.&nbsp; i've grown self-absorbed and isolated.&nbsp; i've heard that's a relapse trigger.&nbsp; i don't think i'm in fit spiritual standing.&nbsp; i think i need to reach out for help.&nbsp; and get involved somehow to get out of &quot;self.&quot;
speaking of &quot;self,&quot; i've been reading about zen buddhism, and i have fallen into a way of thinking, such that god's will is done no matter what.&nbsp; god is everyone and everything.&nbsp; and nothing at the same time.&nbsp; the only thing i have any effect on is how aware i am of the presence of the spirit of the universe and how in tune i am.&nbsp; the world will go on no matter how hard anyone prays.&nbsp; it doesn't make any sense to worry about what other people do.&nbsp; i only concern myself with what i do.&nbsp; i try to act like a responsible citizen.&nbsp; i try to do my part.&nbsp; even when others don't.&nbsp; but somehow i think this way of thinking contributes to my apathy and feeling of helplessness.

"event","my relapse lasted for 2 weekends.&nbsp; during my relapse, on various occasions, i drank: wine, beer, tequila, vodka; snorted a painkiller; smoked a blunt; smoked cigarettes. and then i saw that i was restless, irritable, and discontented during the week, because i could not drink.&nbsp; and when i did drink on the weekends, i drank hard, because i was incapable of dealing with my emotions.&nbsp; i did not want that anymore.

so my new sobriety date was june 1, 2008.&nbsp; i wanted to do it right this time, so i hit aa as hard as i hit mind-altering substances in the past.&nbsp; i understood the program, and breezed through the first 3 steps, and i was on step 4: the personal inventory.&nbsp; this would be my: resentments, fears, and people i have hurt.&nbsp; i found myself again unable to deal with the emotions that this therapeutic exercise stirred up, and i found my mind shutting off.&nbsp; apathy became my defense mechanism for the trauma that came back to haunt me.&nbsp; i really wanted to care, but my mind did not allow me to feel.&nbsp; i did not give a damn.&nbsp; i tried to wake myself up: i went sailing, i went skydiving.&nbsp; i could not wake up.&nbsp; yet i could not go to sleep.&nbsp; so on july 3rd, i decided to take 2 or 3 hits of marijuana from a one-hitter with a friend.&nbsp; all i wanted was sleep, because i've been in constant agony.&nbsp; but all i got was a headache and confusion.&nbsp; at the time, i rationalized that marijuana was okay, but afterwards, my sponsor said this was relapse.

so, new sobriety date: july 4, 2008.&nbsp; i continued to not give a damn inside, but go through the motions on the outside: i wanted to do the right thing.&nbsp; a girl woke me up.&nbsp; she didn't do anything.&nbsp; and i didn't do anything.&nbsp; it was just her company.&nbsp; i felt motivated to go on. i felt motivated to care.&nbsp; and then i went for a run.&nbsp; and something about that particular run woke up me up more.&nbsp; and then i went to an aa conference for an entire weekend.&nbsp; this woke me up even more.&nbsp; i felt the spiritual connection and interdependence again.&nbsp; i felt my third eye open up, and i for the first time in a long time felt the reason why i could stay sober for 10 months before.&nbsp;&nbsp; a speaker at that conference made me cry and feel love that i hadn't felt in a long time.&nbsp; as i hugged her and thanked her, something happened in my body that felt like an electric shock and changed me.

work began to be easier to face.&nbsp; the negativity bounced off from me as it hit my skin, because i began to see the bigger picture.&nbsp; i found myself able to laugh and smile.&nbsp; but it's not a perfect world.&nbsp; i made a rash comment on an inmate's behavior and he felt disrespected.&nbsp; he got inches away from my face and yelled at me, waving his arms.&nbsp; i listened calmly, saying little, then walked away.&nbsp; the next morning i approached him to address his aggressive behavior, and he repeated it, threatening my life.&nbsp; i had no choice but to report him, and he was sent to ""the hole"".&nbsp; that is, isolation.&nbsp; for at least 30 days.&nbsp; when this man gets out, and if he sees me on the streets, he will kill me.&nbsp; i believe this is not far from reality. i am afraid.

yesterday, i saw the dalai lama speak.&nbsp; it was soothing, humbling, and enlightening as i expected.&nbsp; he is what they say he is.&nbsp; i was reaffirmed in my convictions regarding compassion and forgiveness.&nbsp; i was figuratively knocked on my ass by the protesters. as i walked past them, i wanted to look each one of them in the eyes.&nbsp; i wanted them to see the hurt in my eyes, and i wanted to see what was in their eyes.&nbsp; i saw emptiness.&nbsp; i saw mouths move with an ugly slogan released over and over.&nbsp; they're full of shit.&nbsp; i know it.&nbsp; that's what i want to believe.&nbsp; but i'll never know the truth.&nbsp; i am a skeptic.&nbsp; and i don't feel the need to know.&nbsp; i don't have that fear.&nbsp; i don't think the dalai lama would deny them the right to practice their religion.&nbsp; i think they twisted something he said.&nbsp; and i'll leave it at that.

today, my grandpa arrived from russia.&nbsp; two great men, two days in a row.&nbsp; this is more than i could ask for!&nbsp; this man never gets old.&nbsp; he never gets less wise and less inspiring.&nbsp; i am in pure bliss, ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; this is love."

"event","Four days ago I accidentally poisoned myself with vitamin C.  My body was sick, my body was weak, and I could barely move for 3 days.
Two days ago I had to say goodbye to another child.  He was heartbroken, he did not see it coming.  He immediately built up a wall.  He froze up out of pain, just like I do.  I'm not cold and clinical with them, I am their friend.  And maybe that's what they need, but am I only causing more harm if in the end I just take it all away?  Abrupt.
And another one of my children makes me believe again.  He can read my mind and he calls himself ""the healer.""  He speaks of alternate beings that he sees in the mirror, and he speaks of the way he can feel his shadow, and it has been feeling faint lately.  And he has come a long way and I am really proud of him.
My heart's been aching lately.  I still long for a home.  I really love my cat and I am glad that he stopped bleeding.  He loves me too and my parents said I cured him.  I love my sister and I am glad that there is so much I can do for her.  I really love my friends and I love that they listen when I speak, and that I am lucky enough to listen to them too.  I write in a thick green notebook that looks like it's indestructible, and the words in it are firm and hopeful, I think they're indestructible too. But one night I had insomnia and the dark side came out, insomnia always brings out the worst in people.  I sleep 10 hours a night some times, and other times only 3, because I think 10 is too much at once and my body gets confused.  That's okay.  I try to make my days more efficient, meaning I give/produce more than I take/waste.  But it never turns out that way, and that makes me feel like something is missing.  I think I drive too much, but that's the way it has to be, it has to be wasteful like that. One therapist did say I never notice the positive things, so maybe I am just looking at things the wrong way.  But probably not. I probably just make bad decisions all the time.  I haven't drawn anything since I moved out of that house, but I did carve an apple out of wood four days ago.  And in a couple of weeks, my friend says, we may be moving in to our house, and then it will be time for a lot more wooden art.  I think how I feel today will only be today, because last night was weird.  I feel embarrassed because I felt like I was good at playing the drums, but I'm sure it was just the wine that made me think that.  Yeah, I am a fool. I wish I was enough of a fool to not know that though."

"event","My babies.  My 9-, 11-, 16-year old babies.  I'll do anything for you.  Take this strength and take this courage.  I have too much.  I'm serious, take it.  I've walked for endless miles and pushed myself to the extremes just to see if my resources would run out.  And they didn't, so this all has been quality-tested, so take it, I don't need this much.  You can be angry and you don't have to make sense to anyone, I know it's not fair out there.  You've got your reasons for being who you are and I understand.

I got there, excited, ""What's up?  How's it going?"" knowing the type of expression and words I would get in return.  And sure enough, there they went, the guarded facial expression and the one-word answers.  ""Did you fill out that worksheet I asked you to fill out?"" (still excited).  ""No, I left it at school, and I don't even go there anymore anyway.""
...cognitive dissonance.  Something was wrong.  No, everything was wrong.  What?  Panic.  Urgency.  What?
My breath wasn't ready for this, it was still going on like it wanted progression and it wanted to go to the library and it wanted to show him the art gallery.
The second blow: the funding was cut off.
No.  Please, no.  He's depressed and I don't think anyone else knows this; don't let the politics and the paperwork leave him hanging.
Grandma came out of the back room.  Her body is tired and old and it is sick and it is retired.  The lamp behind her was shining right in my face and I could not see her face, only her hunched-over silhouette sitting on an arm of the armchair in front of me. He moved into the direction of the computer and I saw him hovering over that computer with his sister.  A practiced indifference, is that what he was exhibiting with the turning of his back to me? The grandmother spoke slowly and in circles, frequently mentioning the words ""budget"" and ""funding"" and ""insurance"" and ""medicaid.""  I did not understand it directly, just like always, I only understood the general idea.  I could not see her face, but  I remembered her big eyes and thick glasses, and I knew what her huge pupils and the blurry grey iris looked like.
There I sat, fidgeting with my furry hat, looking down at the floor, like a Russian peasant, listening.  My eyes moving in robotic movements from the floor to the lamp, to his back, to the silhouette of her face, trying to guess what her face was expressing.
And then the huge clock above the piano to the left of me started loudly ringing every second.  I thought it would beat 4 times because it was 4 o'clock.  But no, it kept going, adding a sense of dramatic urgency and chaos to the scene.  The urgency and chaos that was subtle and hidden and I think only I was aware of it, since I was obviously so detached from myself.  Very aware of my face as usual.  It felt tight at the moment.  My mouth felt tight.
Maybe military time?  Maybe the clock would beat 16 times?  No, it was going on for over 2 minutes now.  And I could barely hear what she was saying, but I knew she was still talking about funding.  And of course, I was feeling a sense of loss and a sense of despair.  This kid will keep getting in trouble.  And I am not his savior, but I knew I would always do my best and I knew I would help in any way I could.  And I knew she was feeling a sense of loss too.
I said I would call the case manager and ask him if I could continue working with him.  That's all I had to say, and for me it was enough, and I was ready to walk out the door.  But no, that's not how it works with people, they need to always talk for longer, otherwise it would be too abrupt, and I know of this rule.  So she talked more in circles, mentioning more of the same, and I repeated what I had to say a few more times.  The clock was still beating loudly and I could barely hear her.  And then, to not let things die too much, for otherwise the conversation would have been too daunting, I tried to add more to what I had to say.  He could benefit from having a mentor.  He's a smart kid, he's got a lot of potential.  Not much else was said but there was subtle emotion.  And I just wanted the clock to stop ringing.
Maybe if I stand up, I thought, it would bring the conversation closer to the end.  And it worked.  The magic words ""all right"" came from both parties in between other words.  Parting words.  His sisters kept hovering around and he was on the computer with one of them and the clock kept beating with insanity and everything continued to be urgent and insane.  And I went for the door and my hand made contact with the door knob.  But I heard her call his name.  And ""Dmitrius is leaving,"" and this meant that this was a cue for me to say a goodbye.  Just in case there would not be another chance.  No, please don't make this emotional.
I turned around and I looked at his face and I approached him and I was afraid of feeling anything, and I said something very brief and insignificant and formal.  
Will he remember me?  Were my final two sentences to be remembered by him forever?
I was that weird kid.  Much smaller than he.  I did not speak much but always asked weird questions with a voice that was soft and hard at the same time, inquiring in its nature.  Was I caring?  Or was there nothing outside of what was in my head?
""He likes you,"" the grandma said at one point.  That's enough for me.
Abrupt.  Always abrupt."

"event","Death and rebirth.  That's samsara, say the Buddhists.
And it all makes sense all of the sudden.  Because I gave it all my own meaning.  That's cheating, but that's how we survive.  The cycle of death and rebirth happens within our lifetimes.  And one of the ways we die is by turning away, by numbing away from problems that serve as obstacles to help us grow.  All of the sudden all the existentialist theories I've read about make sense.  And Abraham Maslow's concept of being ""problem-oriented"" has become the most easily applied concept, the easiest concept to witness at its work.  I've had a glimpse at enlightenment, and I've seen bits of self-actualization, I've seen immortality, the end of samsara.  But it's all my own meaning, and I don't like what the Buddhists say, and I don't like how they turn away from the painful reality of life, that beautiful pain that leads to progress.  And it all lives in experience.  And these are merely words, approximations, just names for experiences which only I've lived through - each experience for each person is a unique one. Even though we are all in it together, and I am just like you. And I'm excited at the mere idea that I've had experiences which were a close match to those mysterious words I've read in the past. That makes this a pointless post for you, reader, but perhaps it'll serve as a bookmark, a memoir for where I once stood in my life.  A reminder of another bout of naivety. 
Ever since I ate mushrooms that time in November, something strange has been happening when I open my mouth to speak sometimes.  A loud voice comes from the bottom of my throat, and it doesn't sound or feel like my own, but it utters words that are mine, but does it with vigor that it surprises me."

"event","<b>MORE ON BLINDING WHITE LIGHT</b>:  I have recently been doing a lot of research on abused and neglected children.  Much of their emotional, cognitive, moral, and social development gets hindered by their environment at home.  One of the differences between abused/neglected children from non-maltreated children is their representation of self and others - they have skewed expectations of what the world and people living in it will be like.  Abused and neglected children have shown to view themselves as unworthy of love and others as unavailable or rejecting.  Basically, what I am getting at is that, having grown up in a household where nothing was ever predictable, with an alcoholic father and a psychologically unavailable mother, a despondent image of ""others"" has been engraved in my mind.  And even though I am cognitively aware that people are ""good,"" deep down my psyche still has that expectation that people are not as benevolent as they really are.  And when this expectation is disproved, such as by the kind man who helped me get my sick disabled friend on the bus, I become overwhelmed, to say the least.  The engraved pessimism towards human nature becomes alleviated, and a flood of warmth and endless gratitude overcomes me.  And that is a possible explanation of the nature of this ""white light"" phenomenon.<br /><br /><b>ON HATE</b>:  It's not like me to hate.  I cannot do it. In the past, I have lost my sense of self, while trying to please others by trying to be more like them, by hating.  Like my father, and like certain other people I looked up to. I thought hating would somehow make me stronger or, perhaps, more ""wisely discriminative.""  And I am using 'hate' as an all-encompassing word: as a feeling of malevolence towards an individual or a a type of individuals, be it based on their appearance, on their political views, on their knowledge or ignorance... just any malevolence coupled with rage.<br />I used to consider my ""being too understanding"" as a weakness, but that is foolish.  I am understanding of both the strong and the weak, the confident and the unsure, the hateful and the loving.  I do consider some qualities superior to others.  But to hate is to lower yourself to the level of that for which you feel malevolence.  I am even understanding of those who hate, but I do not feel the need to make their ways a part of my life.  I step back and I try to see why they hate, and I feel a compassion for them, because hate is caused by hurt or ignorance.  To be in a state of hate, is, therefore, to be in a state of mental anguish and suffering.  And I wish to help these people come out of their misery, and I wish to help them reach a state of understanding and acceptance.  Sometimes this is futile, and sometimes draining on me, and I just need to remove myself from the vicinity of this person.<br /><br /><b>ON LOVE</b>:  When people go through a break up - when they 'lose a love' - they often feel despair, because they think that this is the end of the beauty of love, at least for a long while.  They find themselves in a state of isolation and they feel deprived of something beautiful, and often try to find someone else to love to fill that void.  However, they often fail to realize that the 'love' feeling does not reside inside that person they lost.  It is in their own heart.  Love does not depend on the other person, at least not after the separation.  Even though romantic love is different from other types of love, and to be hurt over a lost love is healthy, people, instead of fixating on their pain, should spread that love to their friends and family and to the world.  For love is energy, it is strength, and you should envy those who are in love, my friend :).  However, even though 'friendship love' is great, it will never live up to the greatness of the romantic love between two naked hearts. Pure and strong romantic love <i>does </i>depend on the other person. The ideal is to love so purely and openly and completely, that this love is not selfishly stored between the two people, but so that its energy and beauty are branched out to the world, to the weak, to the unloved, to the ignorant.  So that it serves to create inspiration, fuel for more love, and to make the world a more beautiful place."

"event","This is that blinding white light I was talking about. Do you know what it feels like?  Maybe not, it's possible that I am the only one.  When I look into the eyes of a friend I love, and I can just feel that love, and my heart feels like there's this blinding white light beaming off.  It feels like if someone were to cut a hole in my chest, a blinding white ray would burst out.  Another example is when I felt it in Sweden.  I was trying to help my friend on a wheelchair get on a bus, and everyone looked at us in disgust because he was throwing up because he was sick.  And the only person out of the crowd that was kind enough to help us was a weak old black man.  He was coughing and he had to sit down to rest in the middle of helping me pick up my friend.  But he was smiling.  And all the darkness and rage at the injustice at the idle apathetic people watching us lifted off my chest and I felt that blinding white light as I shook that old man's hand and I could not thank him enough.

"event","i'm amazed by how little you need if you end all your addictions.&nbsp; and i do mean all, and any addictions. my days consist of 3hour long bicycle rides, studying things i like at the library, and driving, sometimes long distances, to visit my friends.&nbsp; and all i need is a small amount of nuts, fruits and vegetables to feel full and energized.&nbsp; and i don't just mean food-wise, i'm also surprised by how little of anything else you need.&nbsp; but the one need that doesn't diminish, one that, on the contrary, grows, is the need for good company.&nbsp; it may seem silly, but it's as if that part of me was blocked by shit like junkfood and getting fucked up, but now that there is nothing there to numb me, it's as if a pathway has been cleared.&nbsp; and i can just feel an incredible amount of blinding white light raying from my heart when i see the face of a true friend.&nbsp; and last night i met up with an old friend of mine and all we could do was look at each other and smile big. and we uttered so few words, yet communicated and understood so much.&nbsp; he told me i look healthy and <i>alive</i>.&nbsp; and he did as well.&nbsp; he loves his work and he loves his girlfriend.&nbsp; he loves life.&nbsp; i love life.&nbsp; it's a friendship never marred by falsity or shadiness or greed.&nbsp; a friendship from which progress and positivity spurt like the leaves of a healthy young plant.&nbsp; and his girlfriend glowed with vibrance as she talked about her love for him and the children she works with.&nbsp; i felt intoxicated, but there was only ice and water in my glass.&nbsp; and it's not fair that i only get to see them once every two weeks or so.&nbsp; and that's the way it is with most of my friends.&nbsp; but i am grateful for them, and when i am with them, not a single moment is a moment wasted.&nbsp; and i don't feel so lonely anymore, knowing i have my friends' faces and their words to look forward to.&nbsp; they're all i have and all i need.<br /><br />i just stared at the moon for about an hour.&nbsp; among other things, it said to me, ""shut up.""&nbsp; ""be quiet and sleep,"" it said. <br /><br />it thinks i take myself too seriously.<br /><br />i think you're right, mr. moon.<br /><br /><img src=""http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/9606/wonderalexgreypb0.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />""mother                              to her baby said we're never lost. we're never<br />dead.                              we fly. our thoughts get spun like silken <br />threads,                              cast down below like sighs.&nbsp; i told you baby, <br />once;                              i said, we never die, we simply get untied."""

i'll draw naked people and eat carrots and papaya until my poop turns red again."

"event","the pacific northwest coast<br />holds a place i'd longed to see.<br />an unmarked stretch of beach, tied to your memory. <br />i made my way there, <br />breathed that air and walked on those dunes.<br />i sank my feet in the sand,<br />holding your daughter's hand. <br />there's a debt, sir, unanswered, i can't repay: <br />what you gave away. <br />they say the fire goes out<br />on a star long before we know<br />of the light that shines down on us below.<br />i went to that beach, footprints trailing behind,<br />to be washed out by the tide or for someone to find.<br />_____________<br /><br />maybe when i get to costa rica, my loneliness will transform into something else, something even more beautiful.<br /><br />drawing has been keeping my racing thoughts calmer, and i was right: it quenches a small fraction of that longing for something.<br /><br />goodbye america."

"event","it's one of those october sundays when the sun is low and everything seems like it's dying (but that's just me being neurotic, because it's just me dying, because all the beauty around me is hurting me because it's so overwhelming).  and the streets and the yards covered with dry leaves are so empty of people - why is no one outside experiencing this?  that makes me even more sad and alone.  everything is either red or gold and i swear the sun has been in this half-setting position for four hours.  the air is cool and gives off the illusion of being clean, and this used to be my favorite weather and my favorite time of the year when i was little until, as i kept gaining years, i became less able to handle the melancholy and loneliness of it all.<br /><br />and in a few days, it will be ""<font size=""4"">goodbye america</font>"" once again, and i am afraid.  i know all the nature and the greenness will be too much and too beautiful for me to handle.. it will all swell up inside of me until my insides collapse on themselves.  and i remember two years ago when i went to dominican republic alone, it was too much and too beautiful and i kept drinking and smoking myself into oblivion, but even that didn't save me; i still cried and i still couldn't breathe, and i would have rather had not experienced all that beauty if i had no one to share it with, and i could only think of craig and lis, who were my only friends back then; but now smoking and drinking won't even be there for me, i'm on my own.&nbsp; but maybe this will be different?<br /><br />i realized yesterday that i am genuinely afraid of being alone.&nbsp; it's something i knew before, but it's different to <i>realize </i>it.&nbsp; and it was one of those times when you know you're getting close to truth in yourself when a thought makes tears start streaming down your face and you cannot stop them.&nbsp; and i realized that that fear is what has been hiding beneath my ""numbness"" which i've been sometimes fighting and sometimes embracing.<br /><br />my feeling of loneliness is something i learned to be ashamed of when i was little - i thought it was pathetic, because that's how people often saw it - they felt empowered by my excitement and appreciation of their company, they felt needed and they felt like they were above me.&nbsp; and over the years i taught myself to suppress that loneliness and that fear of it.&nbsp; and i began priding myself as a rugged individualist who need no one - <i>damn fool.<br /></i><br />really, how foolish of me.&nbsp; and it's only now that i've stripped myself of all my numbing habits that i think i am going back to how i was when i was a child - vulnerable and scared and awfully lonely.&nbsp; i think i do this ""going back to childhood"" thing quite often, but this time i think i have really taken it to the limit, because never before have i had such a motivation and dedication to keep myself mentally and spiritually clean and healthy.&nbsp; for the sake of those i love, and even those i don't love - and for the sake of everyone in the world who does not deserve to be burt.&nbsp; this time it's forever.<br /><br />back to what i was saying - it was foolish of me to suppress all that emotion - it is the most intrinsically beautiful thing about being human, that longing, that need for love, and wanting to share moments with beautiful people.&nbsp; that longing is beautiful and it's full of life.<br /><br />and i've been trying to get rid of my numbness throughout my college years, and now i finally broke away from it.&nbsp; and i don't know what broke it... was it the stopping of all my thoughtless habits? was it that terrible night a month and a half ago?&nbsp; both of them combined?<br /><br />and by loneliness, i don't mean just the wish to surround myself with any living breathing physical bodies.&nbsp; i mean real interaction, real, good people, who profoundly care about each other, who aren't afraid to sacrifice for themselves for each other, who care about the earth, not ones who care about superficial shit and gaining and can only talk about themselves.&nbsp; i am contradicting myself because all i write about here is myself.&nbsp; but before one can shed her- or him""self, one must set himself straight, and once the conscience is clear, as are the intentions, then one can extend her- or himself to others.<br /><br />i now welcome this aching tightness in my chest and stomach that i feel everyday, and the panic that i wake up in every morning.&nbsp; because at least i know that i am alive.&nbsp; and even though i cut myself off from a beautiful circle of friends, i know that one day i will find another.&nbsp; and until then, i do not intend to go numb again to protect myself.&nbsp; i will not be a coward.<br /><br />i used to get down on myself because when someone asked me what i liked to do on my free time, i couldn't come up with anything.&nbsp; i have no hobbies or interests.&nbsp; but now that i think about it, the only 2 things i like to do and am fairly good at are writing stories about people and drawing people.&nbsp; my passion lies in people.&nbsp; and now i get down on myself for not having developed those skills, for suppressing them, because my parents told me that there will always be money in being a psychologist, and there is no reliability in art.&nbsp; but that's all i am and all i should have been - an artist.&nbsp; emotion is all i am drawn to.&nbsp; don't care about any sciences.&nbsp; i only want to feel and i want to capture and express and portray those feelings, and i want to share them with others. <br />and maybe that's part of what i experience as ""loneliness"" - it's that longing for creating something beautiful.&nbsp; or at least that can be a way to deal with my current being surrounded by apathy and repression."

"event","i started to draw people again.  especially faces.  and doing that somehow changed my brain - now sometimes when i see some idiosyncrasy in someone's facial features, i become in awe, and i gasp, and my heart stops, and i stop too, and i stare.  and the features don't have to be on the face of someone ""conventionally beautiful"" - as long as they are defined and unique. it could be the way their eyebrows flow into the bridge of their nose, or the way their lips are stern and tight and outlined, or the way someone's face shape matches what their voice would sound like.  no, i guess i can't even describe what it is that moves me about people.  i love people and i love their faces.  there is beauty in everyone.

i rode my bike to the delaware river this morning like i often do, and i took pictures.  and i remembered when i traveled through europe last winter, i always searched for beauty and i thought i would always find something new.  but i can find beauty anywhere.  it's more important to be able to spot it out and to be able to capture it and express it through a medium like drawing or photography; it's not about being in an exotic place."

"event","i've been having semi-lucid dreams.  they usually take place on a beach. they remind me of taking those hour-long walks on the beach this past summer, and passing beach after beach after beach until i cannot go anymore. except in these dreams, there is no way out of these beaches. the strange thing is when i realize i'm dreaming, instead of changing things for the better, i start creating nightmarish figures and making them fly at my face, until i wake up.  i don't know why i give myself nightmares. i guess i'm afraid of staying asleep.  i don't understand why i'm so afraid of everything, including sleep.

lately i've grown so meek and weak and wearied. my voice crackles and i mumble and i stutter and stare  at the ground as i speak, and people notice it, and they walk all over me.
but i guess i've learned to like this vulnerability.  i know i have enough inner strength to endure people's thoughtless cruelty, and if it makes them feel better, then at least some good comes out of it. i do hope they feel better though.  because they seem so lifeless. i may be an emotional wreck, but at least i have some hope that one day things will be okay, and at least i feel somewhat alive.  i don't mind giving up my energy and pride to brighten people's days.  but am i feeding their cruelty?  am i contradicting my own actions?
and the people that don't walk all over me, i open up to them, i tell them about the beauty and the ugliness i see in the world each day, about the emotional turmoil i experience.  and i wait for some response, i wait for them to open up, and all they can do is look away with a blank expression, and distract themselves with beer or 'the boobtube' or smalltalk, etc.  i just want to shake them.  WAKE UP! are beer and 'the boobtube' and distractions what makes life worth living??  what's with the repression? why don't people want to live? 
i feel so alone in this struggle to live a life worth living, that sometimes i think i'll just grow so tired that i'll lean my head against something, lay down and die.
but maybe i just have to suck it up.
maybe i just need to be more patient.


i'm hungry and it's hard to breathe."

"event","this is another story i wanted to bring back.  it's rather long but rather amusing.  this is from a time when i took myself more seriously than i should have, during a job as a respite provider, working with an autistic/mentally retarded adult.  today is jan 08, 2007, but i wrote the story on jul 21, 2005. i hope you enjoy it:
____________________

a typical day with him.

it's about 4:30 pm.  i get out of my car and walk down the path towards his front door.  i can see my reflection in the glass portion of the storm door.   every time it looks the same and every time i remember that i'm probably not right for this job.   the reflection looks serious and maybe even threatening.   the sun accentuates my cheekbones and the hollows of my cheeks.  it looks as though i am clenching my jaw.  veins on my arms are like ropes wrapped around them.  i feel completely relaxed until i see my reflection, and only after i see it, i feel my blood rush to my head and i begin to feel as though i should be tense.  but i remain feeling peaceful, although i become aware that everything about my existence is too rigid for the environment i am about to enter.

i ring the door bell and my reflection disappears.   S opens the front door and motions with his hand for me to come in.  he is always sort of leaning forward as if his back (weak like his mind) cannot hold him straight up.  his face is in a half-way between a goofy smile and just a foolish face, with a hint of fear.  he quickly turns away, showing his abnormally small head, and rushes towards the large table in the living room.  i slowly enter the house and take off my shoes.  it overwhelmingly reeks of indian spices.   always.

i calmly approach the table and ask he him how he is doing.   ""fine,"" he says, avoiding my eyes, and furrowing his eyebrows as if i offended him.  i sit down next to him and look at him with a cynical smile in my eyes as he spastically starts grabbing all the different books that are on the table and asking me which one i want to read.   i take the books away from him and say, ""wait.  stop.  what are you doing?  calm down.""  he ignores me and grabs a book and says, ""i want to read this one.""  i stop caring.

he begins reading out loud, pointing and tapping his finger on each word, which causes him to pronounce each word separately as if they have no connection with each other.  he ignores punctuation.  his accent is very thick.  
 
i watch him, not really listening to what he is saying, because it becomes useless.  his large front upper teeth extend what appears to be an inch past his lower teeth.  his lower jaw is tiny.   some kind of yellow-orange paste is stuck to his very white front teeth.   he never takes his time shaving,  he rushes through everything.  some areas of his face and neck have stubble on them, whereas other areas look shaven.  he always wears long sleeve shirts even when it's hot.   one time he told me that he does not like to wear shorts because people stare at his legs and it is embarrassing.  but he has been wearing nothing but shorts lately.  now i stare at his legs and i think that he should be embarrassed.  his legs go straight down, without any curves, as if he has never used his calf muscles in his life.   his feet look as if he has never stepped with them, as if there are no bones inside of them, as if they are being smashed to the floor by the weight of his legs.

he stretches out his ""s""'s for about 2 seconds every time he pronounces them... ""ssssixsss"".... i cringe when i hear it - i am cold and cruel.   ""sit up straight,"" i say firmly, and he moves his leg from under his buttocks to under the table, not looking away from the book, not stopping reading out loud.  i take the book from him, it is time to ask questions to make sure he comprehends what he is reading.  i quickly glance at the page to see what it's about (it's usually a 4th- or 5th-grade level book).  ""ok, what's going on in the story... what's happening to the main character?""

he looks at me with empty brown eyes.   there isn't much going on behind them.  they are blurry, i cannot quite tell the pupil from the rest of the eye.  he blinks very slowly.  the eye lids lower slowly, his eye lashes following them, and just as slowly they open back up.   after a few seconds of this emptiness:   ""i just told you,"" he says, tapping the page of the book he just read  twice with his finger.  tap, tap.  silence.

frustration begins to give birth inside of me - when you know a person for a few months, you begin to see him not for his mental illness, but for the person that he is, with the same potentials as anyone else.  the entire time, i am aware that he is not as competent as a regular learner, but this does not make a difference to my frustration.  ""ok.  the boy and the girl got kidnapped. by whom?"" i say, trying to help him.   ""the mother,"" he says, because that's who the last paragraph was about.  ""no............ the water nixie.   never mind.  keep reading,""  i say, with my face in my hands, not looking at him,  and put the book in front of him.

when he gets angry or frustrated, he gets bags under his eyes and furrows his eyebrows.  his face looks shiny with perspiration.  if i don't ask him questions about what he is reading, he tends to be happier.  he sometimes looks up from his book at me, with his big round eyes, and long black eyelashes that make him look like a little kid ...HE IS 48...  ""ugh.  sssnakesss.  that's grosss.  i don't like sssnakess,"" he says, shaking his head (sort of like the girls in the movie Clueless - indian people tend to do that a lot), putting up his hand in the air (also ""Clueless""ly),  and curling up his upper lip, exposing his blackened gums.  i observe him with an expressionless face and nod.  i silently let him vent about whatever hatred he has for snakes and whatever stories he has to tell about them, until he eventually gets back to reading.
other times when he gets excited about something he reads, he looks up with a big smile and puts his hand on my arm, which i politely move away, and says ""let me tell you.""   ""ok.  tell me.""   ""i tell you.  i went to california in 2003, it is SOOO beautiful.  and there are big fountains.  they are SOO beautiful.  and the food is sso good.  it is sso good.""  the g's and d's in ""good"" are highly accentuated. i try to agree and respond as politely as i can.

""ok, let's do some mathsss.""   he often has to start guessing in subtraction.  ""stop guessing and do the math,"" i say.  sometimes his mother will come up behind him and start yelling at him in indian over his shoulder and slightly shoving him in the arm to make sure he is paying attention.  sometimes she yells in english.   this tends to encourage me to yell at him too.
the entire family conjures up feelings of disgust and anger in me.  the mother is always munching on something in the kitchen.   i often hear her burp.  but her face has kind of a pleasant look to it.  a look of kindness.  she waddles around the house on her wide crooked feet.  i often have to repeat things twice for her because she does not understand me.  her brain is very slow.  sometimes she falls asleep on the couch and snores loudly while i tutor S.  her husband doesn't wake her up.  he usually walks around in pajama bottoms and a white t-shirt, with slicked-back hair. he's a realtor.  he thinks he is very wise and always carries a stack of papers and his reading glasses.  he speaks slowly, but never actually says anything wise.  he's 71. he has a tiny, frail body.  he looks like he might drop dead any second.   when he sees me, he smiles a wry smile which is more like a snake slithering across his face than a smile. his pudgy cheeks and wide jaws  look comical in contrast to the rest of his miniscule self.  ""hello, demetri,"" he says, murdering my name. negativity radiates from him like heat waves.   he seems paranoid as if i plan to fuck him over and am already in the process of doing so.  i am very courteous and business-like with them.  i depend on them to get my paycheck.

""what do you like to do after reading?  what you like to do after homework?"" says S, rolling his r's.  ""i don't care.   what do you want to do?""  ""let's go play basssketball.""  ""okay,"" i say.   he starts putting on his socks that he pulls out of the closet where the shoes are kept.   i'm pretty sure it's the same socks every time.  he puts on his shoes and fastens the valcro (he cannot tie shoes).  he starts explaining something to me.   something completely incoherent.   something about how everyone should have grandparents.   and something about his niece Sarika not knowing how to read books because she is only 6 months old.  i can only nod.  his parents tell him to stop talking nonsense.

during the drive in my car, i put on Darkest Hour.  ""let's listen to something else,"" he says pointing to the radio.  ""no thanks, this is fine.""  he goes on talking about how he will marry some girl from his ""rainbow club.""  about how it will be in florida, and about how i am invited to come.  i play along.   ""yeah sure.  i'll bring the bachelor party.   we'll have strippers,"" i say with a completely serious face.  he starts laughing and puts his hand on my shoulder.  ""so let's get you a girlfriend at the park.  we'll get you a date,"" i continue teasing him with a serious face.  ""nooo i must marry mindy!""  he laughs and starts trying to put some sentences together with the intention of explaining that one can only have one girlfriend at a time.

we get to the park and shoot some hoops.  he starts talking and holding the ball without throwing it.   ""shoot it,"" i say, ignoring what he says.  then with the same heartlessness, i go on teaching him how to stretch.   ""bend down and reach for your toes... keep your legs straight.  don't bend your knees.  legs.  straight.  legs... straight.   that's not straight.   never mind.""  we run around the soccer field.  he is behind me, swinging his hands from side to side, in a very unnatural motion.   ""let's go!  run!""  i raise my voice when he starts walking.

i drop him off,  tell his parents what we did at the park.   i feel empty.   i feel as though my soul has been drained.   S starts talking nonsense again.  i say i have to get going.  ""ok, see you tomorrow.  eleven thirty.""he reaches out his hand, possibly for a handshake, but lets it drop because my hand doesn't meet his.   it looked like he was trying to swat a fly.  ""see you tomorrow,"" i say coldly, and open the storm door and start walking to my car down the path. 
the time is now about 7:00 pm. i feel myself appearing hard and threatening again.  i feel something eating away at me.  i don't look back, but i feel him and his parents watch me walk away.  with my back straight as an arrow, and my boots making firm steps on the ground, i realize i don't belong here.   not in this job.  not in this town.   it feels like my presence offends others.  

i get in the car, i see my scornful face in the mirror, but i can't do anything about it.  it's who i am."

"event","you know you're alive when you have something that makes you cry. <i>the power of one.</i>  beauty.
atlas shrugged and fountainhead carried me through the hardest times. they also made me cry a couple of times.  tears overwhelmed by beauty.  nothing is more beautiful to me than a clear mind.  
it's hard to find inspiration in the people that surround me.  they all seem so dead and bored with everything the world has to offer.  they get sucked in by pleasures i find repulsive.  their thinking processes are so different from mine.  and even the pop-culture only has horse shit to offer with its weak movies and weak music.  fuck that art.
certain books and certain hardcore music are there for me when i need some sign of life.  there's more strength in them than i'll find anywhere else.  that's what hardcore is all about.  strength.
it's been years since i cried tears that were <i>not</i> from happiness or beauty.    i don't remember the last time i missed anyone.  i only miss things like freedom and clarity.  i loved once.  kristin.  but my standards changed.   and sometimes, i feel tiredness. 

<i>the power of one</i>.  the book reminds me of just how alone i am in my fight for...nothing.  i don't fit into people's criteria for normality, which is based on what the majority does.  i say ""fuck majority, this feels better.""  to some doing what the majority does feels right, as can be seen in the frequently asked question ""who deos that?""   most people say they don't like to follow the majority, but they often immediately contradict themselves.  being underground and untrendy is very popular today.   i noticed people don't notice a lot of things that they do.  especially when it comes to contradicting themselves and hurting others.
 i get labeled weird.  i dont' say things they expect.  some people like it, some don't.  i don't remember the last time i had a normal conversation w/ someone.  i don't make sense to most when i open my mouth.  and when people think i make sense, they usually give me feedback that doesn't make sense, proving that i didn't get my point across.   i guess i should be feeling some longing for quality company, but instead i feel curiosity as to what it's like to be someone else.

<b>shai hulud</b> - if born from this soil:
This world is a burden
And it disgusts me.
I want to deny it,
Its inhabitants and their possessions.
I'm embarrassed to know
This soil produced me.
I'm dying to be elsewhere,
Trying not to belong in a nature
Of impulse and self indulgence.
A brother to none,
my kinship lies elsewhere.
I am separate and loyal to no one,
If born from this soil.
I'm embarrassed to know you;
you do not represent me.
a likeness only in structure,
Not in mind.
I vow to never belong to anyone
Born from this soil
A people that follows blindly
Will not reprimand me."

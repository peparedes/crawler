I'm 90% sure he only failed Science, but that's it. Mmmpphhhfff. I told him if he didn't come over on Monday, I'd be forced to scream. Which I will do so unless he can come over. I need to see him. And really see him. I mean, I hun gout with him yesterday at parks, but I spent most of the time with Joanna.<BR><BR>Since no one there knew her, and she knows sign language, we were pretending she was deaf and a lot of people believed us. And the few people who knew she wasn't, they were playing along. This one kid, Matt, he got in her face and screamed ""DO YOU LIKE VAGINA?! DO YOU LIKE THE COCK?!"" lol it was fucking hysterical.. had a good day yesterday. But today.. finding out that Rob can't come over or go to parks, I'm sad. Sad me, sad.</FONT>"

"event","<P><FONT size=2>So at 3 am last night, I was stupid. My friend.. let's call him.. ::Jeff::, he was begging me to let him see me. I protested for as long as humanly possible and he was like ""Alright, I'm coming over, and I'll be waiting outside"" so I was like ""Fine.."" And I went outside to meet him, thought I heard someone inside say ""Holy Shit!"" So I ran back inside, went back outside when I saw that it was my imagination getting away with me, and my grandma opened her bathroom window and asked what I was doing, and I said ""Smoking"" and that I was going to go sit on the bench by my driveway.<BR><BR>Maybe 30 seconds later, ::Jeff:: showed up.. He came over and sat down next to me on the bench. I was sitting with my back to one of the arm rests with my knees bent and my feet placed on the seat part. I saw his hand move and immedietly thought he was going for crotch ((cause I'm spastic like that)) and felt his hand wrapped around the bottom of my leg. I pointed at him and said ""No. Bad."" And then I heard my Mom's cell phone ring, so I ran half way up my driveway, ran back down, hugged ::Jeff::, and ran into the house at high speed. I turned off her cell phone, unplugged it, watched ::Jeff:: leave, and ran into my room, cell phone in hand.<BR><BR>My mom didn't say anything about that, and my grandmother and my mom went to lunch today, and my grandma calls like every 10 minutes, so if my grandma remembers or actually did see, my mom knows. But she hasn't said anything.<BR><BR>Maybe she's waiting for me to tell her, or maybe she's waiting for me to ask for something and freak out at me. I don't know.. but I know for a fact that ::Jeff:: wants me.. he's wanted me for nearly 2 years.. and I also know because he said ""Babe, I want you"" Yeah, that's not a dead giveaway. Last time ((before this morning)) that I saw him, I caved and kissed him. But this time, I wouldn't let myself. I have too much respect for Rob and I've actually become loyal. *gasp*</FONT></P>"

Anyone on LJ who reads this doesn't know me, therefore, it's okay for you to read it. But people from Monticello or Liberty, they can't. Except for Chrissy. Some people who are regular readers and posters on Digital Expressions will be allowed to read this as well.<BR><BR>Oh, damnit. Rob just text messaged me and said ""Are you feeling any better?"" And of course I said ""Why should I be?"" So he said ""I'm sorry, this is all my fault."" I said, ""No it's not. I shouldn't have told you, cause there is really nothing I can do about it except wait until it goes away."" Now he wrote back, ""Even if you didn't tell me, I kind of figured."" I responded, ""Thanks, that makes me feel better, and I wouldn't have said anything if I didn't think that you liked me even a little."" He just said, ""Well I do."" Ahh, so I said, ""You could have told me that."" He just said,&nbsp;""I didn't want to make things more awkward and I thought it was kind of obvious and could figure that out by yourself."" Damnit, I said, ""I did, and then the 'I don't care' reaction I got from you made me think that you really didn't."" Now he just asked if he could call, so I'll update later..<BR><BR>Now what do I do? Damnit, damnit, damnit. Crap, crap, crap. Now I'm worse off than I was before.</FONT>"

"event","<P><FONT size=2>Okay.. first entry in LiveJournal. I have a diary at <A href=""http://www.digitalexpressions.nu"">www.digitalexpressions.nu</A>, but everyone I know reads it, and there are just some things I can't say.. I really needed a new outlet.<BR><BR>My name is Samantha, I'm 14 and I don't really have a label, but no one else does, so I guess I'm punk. I've been prep (without realizing it, and when I did I was like ""nuhuh"" and fell in love with punk and heavy metal music.) I did the whole goth thing too, that was fun for awhile, but I started to scare people, and I didn't quite enjoy that. I have a boyfriend of 5 1/2 months. His name is Casey, he's a sweety pie. =) I love him, or at least I think I do, but maybe I can't because I absolutely can't stop thinking about one of my best friends, Rob. Casey and I don't have that much in common, but when I'm with Rob I feel so much more different, like we belong. I can't quite begin to explain it. I can never do anything about it though. We're in a band, him and I. He is the guitarist and I'm the bassist. Bass power. That's why I can't. Band is the most important thing in both of our lives. If we ever did go out, and something happened, I don't know how I would handle it. I don't think I'd handle it at all. I don't want to see that happen to our friendship or the band, so dating Rob = no-no. Plus, I wouldn't do anything to hurt Casey.<BR><BR>But today I finally fessed up to Rob about how I felt. I don't know what I expected, exactly, but the reaction I got wasn't anything close to it. You just have no idea how hard that was. It was like I wasn't waiting for Casey to call anymore, I was waiting for Rob. I spend about 4 1/2 hours on the phone with him daily. With Casey, it's less than an hour. I don't want to lose Casey, I'm much too insecure to be alone, and that's what I hate about myself. I can't stand to be alone. I seriously thought Rob liked me back, but I guess I was mistaken. How could I have been, though? Whenever we are together or on the phone he always calls me sexy, constantly. It drives me insane, but I still love it. He says I'm wonderful and so cool and he even told me today that out of all his female friends, he loves me the most. How can I be mistaken? He has to feel the same way as me. It just makes no sense. After I told him, there was just a dead silence on the line.. I can't stand all of this. We only spent about an hour or so on the phone today. He was like ""Yeah, I'm going to go. Umm.. I'll see you on Sunday."" I mean, yesterday, he couldn't talk to me for some unknown reason and I felt incomplete watching Family Guy without him on the other end of the line, laughing at the joke 5 seconds after me, cause he has directTV and I have cable and there is a lag between them. It just felt wrong and I couldn't help but think ""Maybe he's on the phone with another girl."" Which is wrong of me to think. I shouldn't care about whether he is on the phone with someone else. He's not mine. Basically, he never can be, which hurts the most.<BR><BR>Even everything I do reminds me of him. There is this one song, Punk Rock Princess by Something Corporate, it just drives me completely insane. I could be his punk rock princess, and he is a garage band king. I know, it sounds so stupid, but dear lord, it's how I feel. I want to just scream it to him: ""CARE ABOUT ME! PLEASE CARE ABOUT ME! THIS IS HOW I FEEL! I HAVE IT WRITTEN IN BLACK AND WHITE! I NEED YOU TO CARE!"" No one is ever going to understand the tormented soul of a teenage loser.</FONT></P>"

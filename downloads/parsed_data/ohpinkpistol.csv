"event","Today i jigged again.
I know i shouldn't coz i jigged last friday's bio. But it was boring so me and haydee walked out of school. We went to eastwood park and just sat there on the swings and laughed at cosmo mags. Though yumi asked me to go to sing k in the city with her and the others I didn't go.
 Coz i was like no more jigging! And then yeh it was boring and so i changed my mind. I dind't have much money anyways.

Anyways i'm gonna copy mikki and do my abcs coz im bored.

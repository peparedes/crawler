"event","So I just had my second last final. I know I've passed the course, regardless, but still it would be nice to do well. Blah... Now I'm studying for another one, okay maybe I should say now I'm hoping to study for another one. okay, so I won't really. The thought's there, and if I don't study tonight I don't know when I will.

I didn't fall asleep until after 8, this morning, and when I woke up my clock said 2:04. Now my exam was supposed to start at 2, and my clock's 10 minutes fast. Luckily I had just hit it sometime. You ever wonder how you can do things while you're sleeping and not remember that you did them?"

I have an incredibly boring life. Seriously. I love not having to work, this weekend, but I do have two finals (tonight and Monday) and two Easter dinners. Go figure, she who doesn't eat meat has two Easter dinners. So I'm sitting in the library, and instead of studying I'm working on this.

And thanks to the girls on FF, I'm now addicted to Ari Hest (thanks Steph). This makes the second (or third, depending on how you look at it) artist I've ""fallen"" for, recommended by them.

And I'm currently re-reading (so this makes time #3) ""It's Right There"" and wondering when the new chapter comes out, and I noticed that there was a newish chapter of ""The Next Best Thing"", plus I have to read the last chapter.

So studying ? Not likely to happen, but maybe, just maybe."

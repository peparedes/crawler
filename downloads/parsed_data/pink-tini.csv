"event","okay im going to confess. gw and i didnt really break it off, we were close tho. gw and i arent moving out of this apt as of now, but deff in Jan. my plan is still to go to Mass but ive been slacking on my apt search. i will still go with or without gw. the issue between us and is son is deff still present but has subsided as of now. gws son came over for halloween, he was dropped off and gw dropped him off after taking him and nat out. i did not make it any more welcoming for him for the fact im just not ready for him to come into our lives. gw cant and wont understand it but he as to or he can walk away. gw doesnt want me writing on this anymore, so i prob wont be that much unless i have something to say about other than our relationship or him, which sucks.
i jump to conclusions to quickly, i like drama obviously.
im addicted to the comp today tho."

"event","&nbsp;george and i have decided to break it off. 4 yrs, 2 kids, and some love involved. ive decided to move to mass alone with the kids, we've also decided silently that we will deff break it off and resume to seeing other ppl to satisfy our needs. im pretty sure i can find a REAL man out there who isnt going to be put me through this much pain and sorrow. this whole issue started over his son, like usual. im done and i know for a fact no other women will pick up what i dropped, good luck george finding another 17 yrs old girl to take my place. believe me, it isnt going to happen with that hair line buddy. anyhow, i should be ballig my eyes out, feeling hurt and betrayed, feeling alone and scared, but im not. i feel empowered, i feel relieved, i feel george will regret his decision one day but ill be happily married to the man of my dreams and he'll be suffering and wondering where his life has gone. he will amount to nothing and i will amount to something. yes i thought it was true love, yes i thought we'd be together forever. but it just isnt meant to be and the signs are more evident now than ever. we are just not meant to be, maybe in a different situation but not now, not here. im fine with it, i can put this roller coaster relationship behind me, believe me its like a nightmare thats over. i can be a single mother and i may not be able to afford much but ill do it. im ready to make my life the way i want it, with or without george, im ready to be a women and pick up my things and move on. one day ill find that man that will steal my heart and we'll be happy together along with my 2 beautiful children. they are so beautiful and loving, no one will have a hard time loving them as i do.
right now i happy, im excited to know i dont have to wear a fake mask anymore. i may love george but im not in love with him anymore, and i seriously cant stand being fake to him anymore. i dont want to be a part of his family, and i prob never will. i have faked this relationship for too long and have hoped george would turn into a better man, it isnt happening and it just wont ever. my prince charming is still awaiting me, somewhere.... im longing for him, i dream of him in my dreams. hmm, what it would be like to have a real man in my life? i know what i want to do differently in my next relationship, believe me ive learnt hard.
i cant believe its been 4 yrs, thank god its not like 15 yrs. haha. im glad im getting out now."

"event","today i feel sorry. i feel sorry for every mother, father, grandparent who has lost a child in their life. i have read so many profiles, journals and myspace pgs with women who have lost their child from SIDS, illness or stillborn/miscarriages/child abuse. today i feel privilaged to have my 2 children here safely with me. today i feel that i should treasue every single day with them, as if it were our last together. who am i to say we'll be here tomorrow? ... sadness fills my heart. when i feel like being lazy, when i get upset or anxious bc i feel over whelmed ill always remember those women out there who cry at night bc they dont have their children with them. even tho my pregnancies werent planned, we love our children just as much and would never regret making the decision we did.&nbsp;
My children are my best friends... my heart, my soul. I send out my love and prayers to all the women in pain from losing a child."

"event","&nbsp;how can i trust him when he lies about stupid things?? i decided to look in the history thing on the comp to see what has been looked up in the last couple of days. well well, i found a whole search on Rihanna and really exposing pics of her. now i know i didnt do this and its only me and gw living here in this creap apt so i know its him. i always knew he liked her since he masterbates to her... on tv. so&nbsp; i knew he just would never say it to my face. well well i find this and i feel just totally angry. sounds stupid but i feel stupid in a way, bc i knew it... that he liked her and thought of her in a sexual way... but he just wouldnt say it to my face so why am i getting upset about it? bc i dont like the facts hes looking up pics of her and lieing to me about it. then what else is he doing? i dont know... i just wonder why i keep trusting him and i why i keep thinking we're going to be together forever... and why i would ever marry him. i dont know what else he wants... i tell him we can meet up with another girl, i tell him i LOVE women and that id do anything with him and another women... yes im a little over weight but nothing compared to some ladies who are like 500 lbs over weight. i mean come on, i pleasure him, we have sex, what else does he want? is he just a dirty slob that likes porn too much? obviously he has some sexual issue with masterbating too much also. he does it like 3 times&nbsp;a day and when its his day off he does it as much as possible, i dont know i think its sick. seriously his dick is going to fall off, thats how much he does it. gross. anyhow im pretty upset and i think he owes me a apology and i think i deserve some time to rethink about what really is going on in our relationship.
yes i might have spelt masterbating wrong... who gives a fuck."

i bought some christmas stuff from the store down the street. everything was so cheap, so i got some stuff. my mother has been an angel with passing on all her halloween/easter decorations that are soooo nice. but for christmas i dont think ill be that lucky. thank god i dont have a sister bc i would be killing her over my moms stuff lol. even tho my brother may get some nice stuff too, i get the best bc im my momma's baby girl. :)

"event","&nbsp;hmm. bad news, good news? i think im pregnant. actually gw brought up this issue last night bc he believe i am and i kept saying "" no wayyyy"" but after him saying it like 2 million times im starting to believe i am. i dont think i pay enough attention to detail and realize my body MAY be telling me im pregnant. haha sounds stupid huh since ive been pregnant twice, i should know. i dont get my period on a reg basis due to a iron problem i have but anyhow i just dont know for sure though. gw is going to bring home a pregnancy test tonight and we'll see who was right and who was wrong. if&nbsp;i am pregnant shit is going to hit the fan haha yes gw will not be a happy camper, but is he ever? he always seems to blame me BUT im not just doing it with myself?? right? it takes two to tango. anyhow that is the latest news, but im not positive yet either. i think in a way im hoping im pregnant but i know that it sounds bad since gw wouldnt be happy, i feel torn. being pregnant is such a happy time though and i love being pregnant. hmm, i dont know how i should feel about this and im not positive im preg yet. ill be sad though if im not, thats reallllllyyyy bad, gw cant know that. :("

other than the urge to be pregnant again im just trying to be a mommy to my 2 wonderful kids, that best mommy i can be. yes im not perfect and that bugs me but hell... im trying and ive been very proud of myself lately for doing what i do. yes i give myself pats on the back often. silly huh?"

"event","<p>&nbsp;this whole situation with gw's son is really bothering me. i'm not having a good night and feel really out of control. yes, im mentally unhealthy but having ""troubles"" in my life does NOT help. i have such a hard time getting my point across to gw about his son, its such a touchy subject BUT i have feelings, i have issues with our situation, am i not suppose to voice my feelings? ? ? i'm going to try to write my feelings out and list them, maybe this will relieve me and maybe i can somehow translate this to gw, somehow.<br />1. why do i have such an issue?? yes in the beginning of our relationship i was really selfish and immature and didnt like the idea that i had to share gw with his son. it didnt help the situation that gw's mother enabled the whole problem by being a full time care taker of his son. this whole care taker issue started way before me. anyhow, i was very selfish but to be honest gw should have been a stronger person, a better father and he should have chose his son over getting head, ass or just being able to be free and handing his son off to his mother/father. i didnt put a gun to gw's head and tell him to choose me over his son, he did that on his own. he made the agreement with his parents about being care takers of his son before i came into the picture bc of work arrangements and the need of having a ""life"". but i didnt help by being selfish and immature.<br />2. i can't stand the whole family cirlce, i was raised very differently and to speak the god honest truth i was raised better. even though i had my troubles as a teen, i made my choices as a teen and i knew i what i was doing. my parents did guide me to do the right things, they instilled in me good values and a big heart and open mind. i cannot and will not blame my mom and dad for any of my pain i have from my childhood, or my foolish actions. my parents are very different from gw's parents, and i just cannot face reality that they are not going to change. they are raising gw's son, and in some way you'd have to think that they were very loving, caring and giving ppl if they were raising my bf's son, but they arent. they are selfish also, and they want to control situations as well. they could put the responsibilty in gw's hands but they tell ME one on one that they should have gotten legal custody of gw's son, that they know gw cannot handle him or that he does not want to, that gw and his son have no relationship, and that we should move on and live our lives seperate. but then around the corner gw's mother is crying for help bc to be honest she is too old, too tired and doesnt want to be raising another child. who would be at 50 something yrs old, i wouldnt. but to tell the truth i really believe that gw's son would NOT do good with us bc he is so connected with his grandparents, and he knows no rules/regulations, he knows nothing about a normal structed life, and does not know the word NO. he would have a hell of a time adapting to being by himself to living with 2 other children full time. i believe it would not be healthy for him leaving his home with his grandparents but i cant live inbetween like this.</p><p>3. i should be happy he doesnt live with us, that i dont have another mouth to feed, another body to dress, another human to attend to... but im not. im not happy with knowing my bf is torn between his parents/son and our family that we've created. im not happy knowing that when his son is around all rules are broken and put our daughter in danger bc his son cant get the idea that there isnt enough room in the car for him. i cant take knowing he crys like a baby over a pin drop bc his grandparents arent teaching him how to cope with life. im not the first one to say hes over emotional, his school has noticied this also. so why am i so crazy when i say it and why is no one doing anything about it? why does this child at 7 yrs old still sleeping with his grandparents in BED at night EVERYNIGHT?? i dont get this and i dont think its right. but then i feel like im the bad one, i feel like im the evil one. i just dont know if i can do this for the rest of my life, as much as i love gw, i dont want to be in a relationship like this anymore. :( i just cant do it emotionally, god honest truth. im tired, and i dont want to spend my precious time wasting over these issues and trying to change something that will NEVER change, so as i said before, i will not marry gw, even though i love him sooooo much i just will not, i cannot. i hate this bc my feelings are so true inside and i know this bc i can sit here and talk about it without being angry, emotional, except for being sad inside. maybe there is someone out there that could match perfectly with gw but i just cant... i just dont understand sometimes where hes coming from or how he thinks certain things are okay and i just dont have the energy or heart to find out why anymore. i hate to say it but bc of his family/son situation this is what is going to break up apart, and im sure even if i walk away many other women will feel the same. no one would have stayed as long as i have and to be honest no man i know would have put up with my shit as well but seriously a lot of my out bursts and stressfull fights have been bc of his family/son problems, i dont know how to handle, i just cant get a grip on things and i cant handle it anymore. i feel like i should check myself into a hospital, i want to badly bc my mind is so gone and so dead i dont know what to do. i just need to get away from it and it sounds silly and stupid to throw away 4 yrs of love, and friendship but i cant put my mind/body through hell, nor my kids. am i right? or just wrong and stupid, i dont know.</p>"

"event","&nbsp;why must gw's son act like a baby?? this kid is 7 yrs old and he acts like he's 1. should i be putting a diaper on him or what? today gw's brother/his wife, gw's mother and son came to our area to grab some lunch. well, it started by gw's son wanting to ride with us. now we have nat and little matthew and we have a small car. it really isnt safe for 3 kids in the back, especially since nat is still in a car seat. well he had to get his way, so there i am putting my daughter in danger of not being in her car seat for his kid who's acting like a baby. its not even about being spoiled just that he does not know how to handle anything without crying, screaming and pouting. this is where i need to put my foot down. he got his way today about it but i cant put my daughter in an unsafe situation in the car for him. no more!!! i told gw there would be no 3 kids in the back seat of the car and there will not be anymore. i hope our talk tonight about it goes well. i have made a deep decision within myself that if gw does/when he asks me to marry him, im going to say NO. yes i know! ive waited this long for the question, i love him, i want to be with him but i just cannot handle his family or son any longer and DO NOT want to spend the rest of my life dealing with it. its all or nothing, either he tells his parents to fuck off and we take his son and move to mass and try to be a happy family or he washes his hand of the kid and just deals with the fact that hes not going to be in his life, bc i cant do this inbetween shit. his parents are too old, too laid back to really be raising him and they are doing things wrong. gw's son crys about things that my 3 yr old daughter laughs about. my daughter looks at him like he's crazy when hes crying. that is bad. i cant handle the baby act, i cant handle how he does not listen, i cant handle how much of a total brat he is, how is lies, how he TRYS to manipulate sitations.... i just cannot do it, and i wont. i love gw a lot and i know he is a good man but i will say no to a marriage proposal and i will walk away from him with our 2 kids. i will not feel like an idiot like i did today and i will not have a child in my life who acts like a total baby, who does unsafe things and does not know what rules/regulations are. his grandparents can ignore his serial killer tendencies but i will not, and sooner or later they will realize being so laid back will bite them in the ass. i have a wasteful sunday and im stressed. i dont want to fight with gw or sound like im being a bitch but i just cannot stand his kid, if he wants to be around me or nat/matt then he needs to act like a human being, like a regular 7 yr old child who is respectful, quiet, and does not talk back or try to change the situation and realizes that NO is NO."

"event","<p>usually i would be jumping for joy that we're traveling to Mass tomorrow but I'm NOT!! I'm not in a good mood for a number of reasons... one is that gw's mother is driving us to mass and i'm just not in the mood for her leather face, chimeny smoking ass. plus im trying to get my mom to come back up with us to visit and shes being stupid about it. i go OUT of my like 4 hrs to visit her all the time and she cant even come back up with us for a day or two, what the fuck huh? i really wish i didnt have to go to mass tomorrow bc i just DO NOT want to. But i have to, our cars need to be registered and i have to go since they are in my name. sucks ass. i have this pain in my head that wont go away, i think ive had it for a couple of days now. i need to do some house work and i dont want to. im just in a bad fuckin' mood, i feel angry, violent and just out of control. its one of my personality flaws... my internal emotional issues. like a ticking time bomb and it always happens when gw's family is involved in something. god i cannot wait to move to mass where they will not be in my life anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!! ive been looking for apartments and have found a couple. i have to call back this afternoon when the site manager is in. </p><p>i feel like i want to strangle someone... someone like... gws mother?? god i hate her.</p>"

"event","&nbsp;well we're back from mass and i miss it already. i cried a bit in the truck on the way back to maine. i dont think gw realized i was crying but i was. i cant wait to move back and i get excited thinking about it... gw says we wont be able to afford it without housing but i KNOW that we can and im not going to take that lame excuse as an answer... and i wont take it lieing down. lol that sounded funny but anyhow im just trying to get things back to normal. i have a lot of cleaning to do... and im extra tired today, i had to wake up early to iron gw's clothes for work. so i wish i could fall asleep right now instead im writing on the comp. anyhow i miss my mommy already, i didnt get to spend a lot of time with her bc of my grandmother stealing her away so much. that was the only annoying part of the trip was that my grandmother always wanting to go out and my mom having to take her. my mom says shes going to come to maine to visit us but im not going to hold my breath. other than that my day is boring and its deff colder here in maine than mass and that sucks as well. we did go to canobie lake though and spent like 7 hrs there, we had a lot of fun and in a lot of ways i saw myself falling more in love with gw.... more than i could ever imagine i would. OH and did i mention i saw an old friend that i knew when i was 17, right about the time i met gw i was hanging out with this girl. shes 19 now so shes a tad younger than i am, but shes STILL and prob even worse. she looked horrible and smelt bad... she still smokes and does drugs... she couldnt believe how good i looked nor that i quit smoking. she thought that both kids were beautiful and i could tell she was jealous. NOT that i wanted her to be but i was the lucky one that got away from the program we were in and i was lucky for meeting gw. it was funny though bc she was the same girl and hadnt changed and here i am and ive changed a whole bunch, i couldnt believe it. where would i be without gw, i thought and it made me very thankful for him. i gave him a big hug and kiss and my mom told us how much we've changed for the better. that was deff a wake up call. WOWWOWOWOWOWOWWWW! but yeah im back in maine and hating it. lol. im just counting down the days until we move. :) cant wait!"

"event","<p>good, bad and the ugly.... life always has to stab me in the back. last night nat was playing with my notebook coloring in it and she found a pg that had some writing on it and showed it to gw which was a paragraph or two of me venting.. a long time ago. i actually dont remember how long ago it was but it was a while ago. he started reading it innocently but then i yelled at him to stop and he didnt want to... he got upset about it but how could he if those were my thoughts and feelings... he doesnt need to know everything i feel inside?? so he was a little baby the whole night and i didnt give him any sympathy for it nor did i in bed when we fell asleep, nor this morn. so ill wait until he gets home tonight and if hes still being a baby well too bad for him. im not going to say sorry for my thoughts and feelings, i just wont.<br />hmm tomorrow morn we leave for mass... i have this feeling in the pit of my tummy and it doesnt feel good. i know its going to be a hard weekend for me and its going to be even harder leaving and coming back to maine. i seriously hate maine so much and i miss mass so much. god cant Jan come any quicker. i cant wait until i see the look of gw's parents face when he tells them we're moving back to mass... haha that will be priceless. fuck them, i dont live my life around them or their thoughts/feelings. i know we're going to be much happier in mass where we belong.&nbsp;<br />anyhow i just know this weekend is going to be hard on me, especially since we're cutting the visit short and coming back to maine on sunday instead of monday... errr. i was having a couple of good days but today i feel like shit and just dont care. i feel like time is killing me and going as slow as hell. lets hope i can get my ass up tomorrow morn, we need to leave at like 7-8ish in the morn... we have to stop in everett, ma at our old place to get some stuff/mail from chris. im deff going to take a lot of pics though.. pics will help me cope until Jan... ill post them on here and cafemom to share with anyone who cares.</p>"

"event","i have an obsession with cafemom.com. yes i will say it, i know it. i found this website i cant remember how but i found it the other day and have been hooked ever since which has left me to neglect poor livejournal.
well. exciting news... not really. our 2 cars are suppose to be towed tomorrow by maintence. it shows how stupid ppl are around here. all the car needs is a little tlc and about $100 and it would be running, i even said i would trade for a xbox 360, thats how badly i needed someone to take the off of my hands but NO. so gw has decided that we're going to just get both cars fixed and yes at VIP, the nightmare place that got my car where it is today. he says he'll make sure they don't fuck up this time, they better not or this time i will go down there and shove my car up their asses for sure. so this mean't i had to call the landlord lady who was real nice today. BUT im having trouble not having them tow them, i said i would have them towed asap but i guess maintence has special powers now. im telling ya, if a tow truck shows up that isnt for VIP im going to flip and there will be police here. god i hate living in an apartment especially in maine... in mass my car wouldnt be gone in like 1 day. anyhow gw thought of this stupid idea of just driving his car to his parents BUT its not registered and has 3 flat tires. so yeah his parents house is like 25 mins away, thats not smart is it? so i told him NO and i said just get it towed to VIP to get fixed before we leave for mass. if the car gets fixed before friday morn we could take it to mass with us, better than renting or taking the work truck.
my grandparents should be in boston around 4pm i hope they did okay. my parents arent home so i cant see if everything is okay. err. but im sure my mom will email me some good news. other than that im just getting more excited and anxious about 2 things...
1. going to mass for a vaca, god i miss massachusetts sooooo much!
2. the red sox play the yankees tonight and we are going to kick new yorks ass! they lost 16-0 last night against the detroit tigers. suck that!
game starts at 7pm, 3 day series if we beat them out of this, sweep them they prob wont make the finals. hahaha"

I cannot wait to move to Mass and ive been voicing that lately to gw a lot. hes deff got the point and im happy about that. i am very excited to be going down there this weekend, we leave friday morn early as we can and im just sooooo excited you cant even imagine. its killing me knowing its just monday. even though my grandparents will be in from cali and im nervous about that i am just excited to be in the area i want to be... its so diff. if your from that area you'll understand. plus red sox are in town... we'll be going to a game also. hahaha i got into a game, lucky me!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","hmm. why do things have to be so difficult. well i looked up to see if i could set up where we went to a red sox game in mid sept, which could happen but i would have to be sure that we could make it and without a vehicle, or gw being able to take some days off i dont think we would be able to. so i found tickets for sept 2nd sunday, game starts at 2pm. so we're just trying to work everything out. should be fun? the casino thing could still work out... if i wanted to put the effort into it. but anyhow... if all fails gw wants a MOSS (pats) jersey so ill get him that from the sports store.&nbsp;
well i have chores to be doing but they just dont seem as fun as just sitting here on the comp. but i do need to get up and clean. of course the living room is always the worst place of all bc natalie always trashes the place. i try to keep up with her and try not to&nbsp;let her throw everything around. my kitchen is spotless. my mom says i have an obsession with cleaning products, which i do. but my kitchen is spotless bc of mr clean wipes... they are like paper towels heavy duty but they disinfect everything which is nice also. but i do need to catch up on some chores that i have been slacking on.&nbsp;
plus natalie is in the stage of being a total terror and i cant take it. i get really annoyed and i yell at her until she sits. she can talk more which is good but then again she says no, and a bunch of other things. nothing naughty just reg no, and i want and such. but she is just not listening to me and then calls me ucky when she cant get her way. and whats even worse she seems to think that she can have a pacifier again just bc her little brother does. i have to hide them, and make sure she doesnt get them or she'll put them in her mouth again. she only tries this trick when im home bc gw would whoop her bum if she did it in front of him. shows how well she listens to me. well its only 1pm and gw works till about 5:30ishpm. i guess he says hes going to try to get the truck tonight but i wouldnt push it if i was him. hes borrowed it a lot and it JUST came out of the shop. i told him he has to be careful. it wouldnt kill us if we didnt have it... his parents would just have to be productive tomorrow and come over here. wow... that would be amazing... his parents actually being productive lol. lazy asses."

"event","ahh. im trying to plan a suprise for our 4 yrs anni coming up in sept. i wanted to make it a really special suprise and i have about $600 and odd some of dollars to work with. my first idea of course was foxwoods casino since we love going there, and gw would die to see their new poker room they have... which is like 24-7 poker, all kinds, and the poker celebs play there too, of course when their not in las vegas playing. but anyhow, my idea was to get a hotel room for one night... they really nice hotel room its called a Petite Suite and basically has... a jacuzzi, sm living room, kitchen area, wet bar, balacony, king size bed (seperate bedroom) and a couple of other things that i cant remember... oh and its over the casino part which means just a elevator ride down to the court and take a left to the enter into the betting tables. easy access for gw. anyhow the hotel is called The Grand Pequot Tower. Sounds fancy huh? now about dinner, i didnt know if i wanted to have a private dinner in our hotel room OR do a nice dining experience in a real nice restaurant .... private table kind of thing. but i dont know yet, depends on the budget of course. the hotel room is going to be fairly cheaper than i thought, espcecially bc its only one night also. but either this idea which im leaning towards OR a day at fenway. which includes of course seeing the red sox play lol. and then a little night out on the town in Boston which we havent done in a longggg time together. so i dont know, im still investigating all the options and what i want to do but either idea should throw gw off and be a total suprise for him. i love him, he deserves it. actually the dream suprise would be for him to play poker with a poker celeb, that would be the shit. like phil ivey or something, and occassionally they do play at foxwoods in the poker room, im trying to find out if they have any interesting poker games going on that would involve them around the time we'll be there. but prob not. and im thinking that maybe we'll rent a limo to take us from my parents house to the casino. like i said.... $600 can go a long way if you get good deals.... believe me you have to hunt though... im tired already."

"event","well i had a fun filled day yesterday. turned out better than i thought it would. even though waking up at 7am sucked ass, and then having to wake nat up and then beg gw to get up so i could be on time for my eye apt, which i ended up being a little late. i took matthew with me, while&nbsp;i was getting my exam he played with the eye doctors wife, he seemed to enjoy it a lot. anyhow i got my prescribtion and then they eye doctor tempted me with glasses that were beautiful at his office. of course i couldnt afford them, well i could but gw wouldnt let me get them. anyhow so we decided to go to sears instead. i ended up just getting my old lenses in new frames.... bc everything else was just equaling out to the original price the eye doctor had given me. anyhow i did go shopping though, of course. i got a new red sox baseball hat, i bought natalie official boston red sox sneakers from olympia sports... they were on sale and i HAD to get them. and then i bought some nick-nacks for my grandmother/grandfather who will be here on the 28th !!!!! im nervous. 
oh we came home yesterday evening to see that the stupid maintence ppl had put tow stickers on our 2 vehicles we have parked in OUR apt spots. can i mention we get 2 spots, our numbered spot and the visitor spot... yeah and now their going to tow our cars on the 29th of august. hahaha they are dreaming. i told gw that im going to sit in my car so they wont tow it lol. im going to put up a fuss though. fuck them.&nbsp; 
not much else to say. we are all tired from yesterday especially nat... shes very grumpy as well. suprising im not that tired.
did i mention the red sox lost last night. dice k was pitching he did good but fuck they lost. what the hell. and the yankees won!!!!! which sucks even moreeeeeee. yesterday on the radio.. i think it was some kind of sports talk, they said percentage wise the red sox had ... now i forget the joke. it was funny but anyhow it was like 89.6% or something percent wise, they had made a joke that if they put 9 more warm bodies it would make the human body temp and we would win. it isnt funny now but it was and i think i got it wrong but anyhow, the sox lost."

"event","okay... went on the search for an eye doctor to set up an appt with and finally found one here in belfast. decided id get my prescribtion and then go to sears or lenscrafters to get my eye glasses. BUT i have an 8 am appt in belfast tomorrow morn AND the eye exam without insurance will cost $100. gw is going to freak out badly but thats what he gets for accidentally breaking my glasses. we had an accident the first time and they were fixed but they cannot be fixed this time... sadly. so i made this appt for tomorrow morn. then in the afternoon after resting a tad bit we're going to go and order some eyeglasses. hmm should be an interesting day since gw has his parents car and we're going to bangor. did i mention that yesterday gws parents decided to let us borrow their car for a couple of days. i thought it was weird that all of suddent they had this un selfish act of kindness. but whatever. i just want tomorrow to go smoothly and not have gw and i get into a silly fight about nothing. its like the first day we've had a car in a long time. im excited just to be able to get out of the apt. so i just hope its stress free. but ya never know.
i have chores to be doing. ive been very lazy i have this neat cleaning chart i use but some days i dont follow it. my mom says i have an obbession with cleaning products lol, yes i do have a lot of cleaning products and just spent $50 last night at walmart on cleaning supplies, but its better to be clean than dirty right? i hope so... other wise we have problems. of course ppl here in maine dont really clean up, a lot of places around here except for the ppl who have nice houses ... other than that ppl make their places look like shit. oh did i mention pee wee's playhouse is on ON DEMAND now, nat seems to like his show but i dont think ill be playing them anymore bc after watching them they are kind of ""weird""... just some things he does or says, or the plots of the show are just weird. i use to love pee wee's playhouse, i watched him as a kid but now i dont know.
im working on my wedding planner business as well. i ordered my fabjob book. so all that holds me back now from starting my business is just location. im waiting until we hit massachusetts. i know more ppl, so does gw my business will do better in mass. but yes im becoming a certified wedding planner... exciting huh?
im also happy to say ive been getting around to working on nat and matthews baby books, they are turning out lovely. i love scrapbooking its very realxing."

"event","hmm how do i explain yesterday. i dont. it is toooooo explicit to write about and i dont really feel that comfortable speaking about what happened bc its kinda a piece of me that i dont really reveal to ppl except for gw. anyhow it was not good.... not a good thing at all. we did fight, we are all okay, still together of course. i realized last night that gw has to really love me, we have to really love each other bc even though we went through so much bullshit yesterday and hurt each other emotionally he still came home to be with me bc he wanted to, NOT bc i asked him bc i didnt. and we still held each other in bed and talked about how we loved each other and how our future is going to be, and its going to be good. hopefully he gets the work truck back for his day off... i NEEEDDDD to set up a eye glass appt bc mine broke finally. they are finally dead and gone. they broke a week ago and i had them fixed but they were very fragile, well now their broken and i can hardly see. its pretty important for my eyes to get new ones asap. anyhow plus im going to start threapy, i need someone from outside my family circle to talk to. im excited about it bc ill be able to say what i want without feeling afraid, or bad for hurting anyone. well. yesterday was horrible, and now we're okay. today was and still is a sleepy day. i have some chores to do, and need to take a shower, so i think im going to go do that now.
i meant to clear up that the patroits did not win, i thought they had but saw sports center on tv and realized they didnt. oops. and the red sox lost yesterday..... i wanted to blame gagne bc he was pitching but couldnt bc it wasnt his fault i guess. yes i did watch the game even through the fighting, im a fan cant miss the game."

"event","hello bitches... lol just wanted to say that. sounds stupid tho. anyhow my day is boring as usuall... even with having 2 beautiful children i think i need some more excitement in my life. well gw wants to go to the mall tonight, guess how? being illegal and driving the car that isnt registered. lol. old habits never die. cant teach a dog new tricks i guess? i really dont think going to mall is that important of taking a chance of getting our car towed or ticketed for like a hudred bucks. but ya know im too bored to say otherwise. i like the silly thrill lol, believe this isnt the worst ive done. i had this mecury, gw bought it for me it was my first car. i drove it with massachusett plates in nh for a while, now the car was registered well not really but the plates were under someone else's name, i didnt know them but was thankful they gave me free plates to ride around on. lasted a while until some pig in manchester, nh decided to give me a ticket for it and then i had to get my car registered in nh. did i mention i had no license this whole time. its funny how we get away with these things huh? good memories, i was lucky.
now my life is boring. well except for the everyday motherhood thing that goes on. and at times its exciting seeing my kids grow into little adults BUT i still need something else going on in my life thats going to be exciting. thats WHY im excited to move to mass, bc im sure there will be something there that will feel that hole. not here though, nothing exciting happens here in maine except for dirty hillbillies moving their shit from one rats nest to another.&nbsp;
errr. gw says hes in a bad mood tonight. sucks, usually this is when we have our juiciest fights. really bad hurtful ones. i guess im just in one of those moods that i think back on all the passed yrs and how fast they flew by. i miss some parts of my life... like when gw and i lived in manchester.... even though it was some fucked up times with us fighting and putting poor p.g. and r.g. through shit... i still made memories with them. i remember how upset i was when gw pushed me to go with him to maryland with his stupid parents. even though i knew i had to leave with him i was so sad. i felt apart of something living there and we had some good times.... even though the bad times were bad and i regret those times i would never give up my good memories.&nbsp;
hmm... i dont know, life just sucks here in maine. so fuckin' boring. the mall is the most exciting place you could say bc there is no where else that is hopping with ppl. well at least normal ppl. everywhere else there are smelly, gross moron ppl. ill say it again ppl from mass/nh NEVER EVER move to maine bc you'll hate it.&nbsp;
oh the red sox lost last night. the first game they won bc they had a double header but the second game they lost. i blame it on gagne, i think hes payed by the yankees to suck at pitching but yeah we blew it. we were 1 point up and then we freakin' blew it. we should have put papelbon up to pitch but NOOOOO terry&nbsp;francona said we couldnt bc he already pitched and we didnt want to tire him out. retard, he actually got thrown out of the game along with youkilis... the ump called a strike when it should have been a ball and they both went crazy... the ump must have been getting butt fucked by jeter and decided to be an ass. yankees suck. we got rid of wily mo pena... he wasnt doing much anyhow.&nbsp; yes mothafucker im a sports freak. had to become one living with gw for so long. now of course ive been a life long red sox fan, my father instilled that in me, he use to take me to ball games as a kid.... BUT i never really understand everything exactly. well now i do though and im getting better. cant wait until the patroits are playing, they had a game last night but it wasnt on tv. pre season game agaisnt the titans. patroits won of course. anyhow we're planning on going to a pats game. that will be fun. im eyeing this pink fleece pats jacket at the sports store along with this pink rain jacket with the red sox logo. there both cute but expensive. hmm gotta go though, gw going to be home soon.
lets hope we sweep the angels tonight. game starts @ 7pm, watch it."

"event","i do not like it when ppl do not listen to what i say. this car issue is freakin' stupid. gw wants my mom to register the car we have BUT really she doesnt want to bc its to complicated and i dont want to bother my mom to do it. its more complicated than you think, i will not be able to walk in the registry and just get my car registered. i have like 2 diff address on my license and my registration and its really fucked up bc no one manchester or nashua speak to each other about anything. so yeah its complicated. anyhow, gw is up my ass about. he want to get a broken car registered so he can drive it and have the chance of dieing. did i mention the car leaks gas??? boom boom. anyhow hes getting mad at me about it.&nbsp;its suck in maine anyhow i dont really care at this point if we have a car or not and in reality his parents can travel to our house if they want to visit him, they have a car. grow up. i guess the work truck is in the shop being fixed and i guess it has major problems. i hope they dont blame gw about it but if they do then theres not much he can do. he did drive it for a long time even when he knew there was something wrong with it.&nbsp;
other than that life sucks as always. it is really depressing living here in maine in this silly apt. i just cant wait to move back to mass where there are normal ppl to interact with. god i cant wait. i advise NO ONE to ever move to maine who is from mass bc you wont like it, big difference of life.oh and whats even more annoying is that gws parents cant decide where they want to move. i cant believe they are in their 50's and growing older and they dont have anything stable set up for themselves. my moms the same age but my dad is younger and hes already talking about retirement and how they are going to travel the world and do amazing things. they are well set off anyhow but im glad i dont have to worry about them and how they are going to spend the rest of their lifes. but gws parents are screwed. my parents own their house, cars... pretty much everything. they just pay the reg house bills. but gws parents dont own a house, dont own their car.... have pretty much nothing but horses that they own. which they shouldnt have to begin with even if you can resell them its a stupid move on their part bc their NOT making a siginificant amount of money off of it. anyhow, they keep changing their minds on where they want to move... gw and i want to go back to mass and i pretty much have convinced gw it would be for the best, which it would be. but his parents on the other hand think about stupid ideas like MO where gws brother lives. I AM NOT moving to MO fuck that. i know where moving to mass bc im going with or without gw and gw wont leave me and the kids. but its sad to know his parents are stupid and cant decided where they want to live plus bc they&nbsp; have gws son its even more sad. im not going to move where ever they want to bc of his son, i already have done that since we met and i hated every place that they took us to. im done doing it, nat is going to start school next yr and i want to be in a stable living arrangement for my kids. can anyone understand that? his parents are just unstable ppl and pretty much always will be bc nothing will be perfect enough for them.
ahhh that feels good. i keep this all bundled inside and it feels good to just let it go. i cant believe its going to be sept soon. gws and i have our 4 yr anniversary coming up. and its getting closer to JAN!!!! our lease is letting up and i cannot wait. plus matthew will be a yr old and i cannot wait for that either.
the kids are going well, natalie is officially potty trained, shes a little behind her time but it was a lot sooner than gws son which it took him until he was 4 yr old to be potty trained. nats just 3, turned 3 in june so shes okay. and matthew still isnt eating solids very well. so we're trying to work on that, hes kind of picky. likes to nurse more than anything.
cables fixed also."

i dont think ive had time or much to say.... i guess i go through phases. plus i havent been feeling myself. another personality flaw. ive been trying to get into a routine of life so i can at least try to claim to be normal but i just cant get my lazy ass to do it. another retarded personality flaw... being mentally stupid really sucks. its funny bc my head has all these good ideas, and my heart is so kind (at times) but getting my body to do anything is crazy. i need my own vaca.....
but yeah gws vaca is over and im just counting down the days that we leave for mass. i love going to mass bc i cant wait to move there. Jan our lease is uppppppp!!!!! hooray. i cant wait to move."

LMFAO i dont think so. so we're going to lease and most likely we're going to lease either a 07 nissan sentra or a 07 pontiac g6. just havent decided which one has the best deal for lease options. but tomorrow morn gw goes in at noon so we're planning on hitting one dealership to deff make a decision. it sucks though bc i dont want to give my hopes up, i want a newwww car so bad but gw is always changing his mind or thinking of a new idea. lets hope he sticks to this idea. <br />next week is our apartment inspection and i still have to get the rest of the marker off of the wall. plus i have to find an outside area rug for the cement that we stained lol opps. i think its like battery acid or anti freeze. either way it stained the cement. plus gws car gas leak has eaten up the ground by his car so we have to hide that also. arent we horrible? <br />i dont know if i mentioned but our neighboor got his car keyed by the punk kids who live in the front of the apt. now when we drive in our apt complex the front of the apt place is empty they must have been all evicted lol which makes me laugh bc they deserved it. the kids in front were punks, whether they were the older or younger ones, they were punks. i guess the neighboors car is going to cost close to $3,000 to repaint bc of the damage from the&nbsp;keying incident... they keyed the WHOLE car. sucks. gw says the neighboor did get on top of the kids a lot but they were punks so what do you expect still doesnt make what they did right. <br />i was starting to get a headache again, hopefully not like last time. but its kind of going away. i deff need sleep.... i neeeeeeddd sleep. so tonight when gw gets home im going to try to just snooze, im not feeling the greatest. <br />it feels good to write in my journal, ive missed doing it the last couple of days. <br />oh and matthew likes carrots baby food.... he actually ate it without any faces today. lol yeah!!!!!!<br />anyhow for the last 2 days ive been trying to put together a cleaning routine so i can stay on top of all the chores i have for the day. i was watching my fav show or at least one of my fav shows.... jon and kate plus 8. they have 8 kids, 2 twins and six truplets. kate who is the mother/wife... she has this crazy way of cleaning the house. i cant imagine thinking about cleaning the house when i had 8 kids at home. well actually 6 kids since the twins are in school. she says she mops the floor in the kitchen/living room area 3 times&nbsp;a day on her hands and knees. omg how can you do that? while making lunch for 6 kids, helping 6 kids nap? i cant believe it because i get bent out of shape about the apt not being super tidy and she has her house extremely tidy. well like i said ive been trying to put together a routine of things i need to do daily, every other day and every sunday. plus i have laundry baskets everywhere in the apt so gw can throw his clothes in them without losing his socks due to throwing them just anywhere. laundry is the only worry i have since i have like back of laundry prob adding out to at least 6 loads... and i cant do it bc we pay for laundry. a buck for each, wash and dry. but i dont go over gws parents house and their washer/dryer sucks it marks our clothes so i guess ill have to suck it up and just do all the the laundry here. i like the laundry mat washers that are HUGE... we used those in everett,ma when we used to travel to the laundry mat. wish we had those here or at least a laundry mat in general.<br />well ive got as far as writing down the 3 catergories and now just following through. im still trying to get matthew and nat on a good routine through the day and night. nat is fine sleeping at night as long as she doesnt have her nap, and matthew well.... what can i say, hes spoiled. my new home has been the couch.</p><p>on another note, it is really hot here. gw says its hotter here than concord, nh which i was suprised about. i have the ac on and i have since this morn. wish we had hampton beach this way.... except here in maine we dont. it sucks. im trying to hopeful about the car issue tomorrow.</p>"

"event","i hate having neighboors... god do i. so just like 2 seconds ago the women next to us decided to come over and ask to see if gw was home from work. then i asked why, she wanted to know if gw could drive her to pick up her booyfriend/husband whom ever he is from the hospital. yeah okay! i said he wasnt and said i was sorry and that both of my vehicles were not working so i couldnt take her. so THEN she offered for me to take their van... what am i suppose to say then? god talk about being pushy, theres a women who lives on the other side of us who could do it, i have 2 kids i dont think so. maybe if it was just me and i had nothing better to do with my life then i would. but i cant and when i told her i couldnt she kind of gave me an attitude like i was doing something wrong. hahaha. god ppl have nerve huh? plus on top of that all the guys car got keyed. lol which is not funny but i have to laugh bc hes really having some bad freakin' luck. the punks who live in front of the complex prob keyed it, they deserve to get whipped... they are such little shits not just bc they keyed his car but bc they walk around here smoking cigs, skateboarding and being punks... i remember being a punk but now its just plain annoying.
so i cant get the womens face out of my mind... me saying no and her thinking i was a total bitch. why though? err some ppl, like maine ppl are dumb. sorry everyone who lives in maine but jesus you all think that ppl are&nbsp;suppose to just bend over backwards for ya. it doesnt work that way, sometimes ppl have lifes, family, jobs... cant just drop everything to drive your ass to the hospital.
my day is long and has been kinda of stupid so far, lets hope nothing else goes wrong. im planning on having a good evening of going out and SHOPPING. plus we're looking at some cars that we just might buy. yeah! new car. but now im nervous that IF we get a new car the punks in the front will key it... if they do i swear im going to key every car in front, myself.. yes... key key key to the high heavens. i know its immature but you cant do much to them but play their own game and beat them at it. and believe me ill beat them at it.
hahaha im evil. lol not really, just bored and nervous that gws parents are going to pop up and ruin my night plans. errrr i hate living near them."

"event","<p><em><font size=""3"">hmm today has been really boring and longggg. gw left for work at noon today and like an hr later i was like wow the time is going by reallyyyyy slow. now it seems to be going by a little faster. we stayed up extra late last night way into the morn watching godfather part 1. we're bad little kids, lol, i was addicted and couldn't stop watching it... of course gw had to comment on everything since im italian... gw likes to compare italy and germany since he's german. so it made the movie so much more funnier with him making comments about how weak us italians are, which we're NOT. man we kill ppl.. we kill our own ppl lol. yeah i dont know about that since ive never killed anyone before obviously. but it is funny like how the italians kiss on cheek or hand to show respect and love for their family or close friends... gw says its gay lol, i had to laugh bc if you didnt do that then you'd be showing disrespect. a big no no. no offense to anyone who is german bc i have nothing against germany or the germans but god german women can be big, and kinda ugly. i mean the real real german ones that look like they could kill a 300 pound man themselves. all that matters is that i love my heritage, when we lived in everett, ma like when we first moved there the whole soccer thing was going on and everyone on our block was riding around with the italian flag screaming and tooting their horns.. it was a blast to see so much love for italy and feel like i was apart of this big community... it helped that we lived in an area that was filled with italians. and i dont mean just 1/2 or part italians i mean full blood mothafuckers. yup yup. we had this shady joint down the street from us that gw went to play poker at that looked like a nice italian rest. but never was open expect for 2 days like thurs and fri for poker and then the other days they had the windows blocked and you never saw anyone in or out, but they would advertise menus and such. weird? i thought it was funny... deff kinda thought it was fishy though. anyhow enough about that shit, just thinking about how MUCH i miss massachusetts. god do i. i never realized how much a location can really stay in your heart... or actually the place that you grew up... i was born and raised in the NH and Mass area... i knew nothing else until i was a teenager and older and now look at where i am in MAINE errr i shouldnt be here. yeah maine's nice for older couples or ppl who have family, lived here for their whole life or just like a slow paced type of life. but i dont, im a city girl no matter how much country gw thinks i am at heart im a city girl and i LOVE BOSTON, lived there for 3 yrs while i was a teenager it was freakin' cool as shit being a teenager and living in Boston. anyhow even where i lived in NH was more of city than where i live now. so i decided that i was going to put money away for our massachusetts savings account so we can move back there. i dont know how much i have so far since its in a real pink piggy bank but ive been putting extra change and doller bills in their almost everyday. so hopefully in like 3 months we have a little saved. but buying a house in mass prob wont be happening, so no house owning not yet at least, wait until im making my $75 an hr... what a life changer huh? i think the first thing i want to do when i have a big sum of money is buy season tickets for the red sox for gw and i. that would be sweet, ive really gotten back into the whole red sox thing and even more now. before i was like in and out, but ive loved the sox since i was a child, i remember watching the games with my father on tv and in boston at&nbsp;Fenway, &nbsp;memories... we've lost 3 days in a row now... hopefully we win tonight.<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/pink_tini/pic/00008f9z/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""319"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/pink_tini/pic/00008f9z/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;thought this was a cool picture. deff want to head back to Fenway and snap some really nice pics of the kids and us.... add to our collection of family photos i have every in my house of the kids and us on our adventures.<br />well nat is upstairs prob doing more art work on the walls and matt is crying, errr its only 15 mins to 7pm errr its boring today boring boring.<br /></font></em></p>"

"event","okay so bad news.... really bad news... 
woke up early with matthew bc he was grumpy, bad start to a day. then nat wakes up really early mostly due to her going to bed extra early last night. so nat sits down on the couch to watch some cartoons while i rest with matthew. well at 8:30am the stupid cell phone is ringing off the hook and guess who it is? gws parents, wondering about coming over. AT 8:30 IN THE FREAKIN' morn and what pisses me off the most they didnt show up here until almost 3pm. lmfao, so why were they calling at like 8am then? they are such idiots ill tell ya. so anyhow, i give the apartment the best cleaning ever, i like the apt to look extra spiffy especially when his parents come over bc gws mother is a dirty women and im not, and my mother didnt raise me to be. anyhow they get here, i was upstairs when they arrived... when i do come down gws mother is asking if matthew is on food yet... gw doesnt know anything and i jumped right in and said yes. she kind of snarled about it, but its really none of her business. so i said hello and asked how their trip to MO was... like i care... and pretty much for the rest of the visit they were both rude to me. i dont care really except for the fact that they are in MY apartment and NO ONE treats me like that especially some old farts like themselves. im suprised they didnt croak driving back to maine. lol whats even funnier is i guess they are really busy at their job bc of them being away for so long. they work for some rich lady who pays them to take care of her land and house, how they got that job i dont know. bc they are dirty people who lie and abuse privilages...&nbsp; anyway, so they were complaining about their boss working them. lol which i think is funny bc its called work. so they couldnt stay for long and the car issue, well the car is not starting. i had a guy from a garage down the street come up and look at it and he doesnt know whats wrong with it, guesses the fuel pump is prob gone. i guess the car we have has issues if you run it low on fuel a lot, something stupid like a electric starter thing involving the fuel pump... i dont know. anyway i wanted to get the car taken care of today since it is gw's day off... but hes to worried about taking nat and his other son to the movies. HELLO we have like limited food and limited amount of diapers you'd think that he'd be thinking about getting the car fixed or calling his boss and borrowing the truck for the rest of today. duh lol. but no hes stupid says something to his son about going to the movies, his son cries like a baby about not being able to go, let me remind you his son is seven and still crying like hes 2. so now hes kind of obligated to go, askes his parents to drop him off at the movie threater and pick him up. well.... i wasnt to happy. i give two shits less that he was going to the movies but the point was he had other obligations first before the movies. god that annoys me. sometimes gw doesnt think right. well here i am, the apt is peaceful. matthew is sleeping. i cant believe how rude his parents were to me lol it is really funny. they are dumb. well when we move BACK to massachusetts they will be wishing they were kissing my ass lol bc their going to be stuck with gws son to raise. which is another whole other issue. but not to my concern, i have my own children to worry about. you know whats funny too, gws son says ""go see your mommy"" to my daughter and then says ""i have my own mommy"" and then says ""you have your own mommy too"" but the way he said was very much like a smart ass, which most of his comments come across as.... but what bothered me was that ive NEVER tried to be a mother to him, and in reality ive prob been more of a mother to him at one point than his mother ever has.... and im certainly a 100 times better mother to natalie/matthew than his mother is to him.... but for him to say something like like a smart ass and to a 3 yr old who cant really talk that well yet or prob cant understand what that means is reallly weird to me. i always told my mother that gws son would also have this issue with me mothering matthew/natalie. obviously gws mother trying to be his sons mother is not working bc she isnt even a good grandmother to beging with, but then to have a mother that is drug addict who is jail as of now and who runs out your life all the time must be hard. but my kids dont need to hear of it or have their mother compared to his... i dont know i feel like im talking in circles but gws son is just a smart ass, always has been. and that is due to gws father/mother and of course his sons real mother who is a total creakhead. who knows what gws son has been exposed to. now i said i didnt call kids names.... but come on i have to call him a smart ass bc of the things that come out of his mouth. i dont care very much for him or his attitude especially when around my children. thats partly the reason we had another child, i wanted natalie to have a brother/sister that was going to be her best friend... and always watch out for her, help her and be raised by me. gws son has a diff lifest\yle and hes not raised correctly, theres a lot that is wrong with this picture especially that gws parents who are well into their 50s are raising his son, and dont know how to or dont have the energy to. but at least i know my children wont be smart asses.... will not say or do anything like gws son does. and it worries me with them being around him bc kids pick up from other kids... i guess thats an obstacle ill have to over come. 
at least he doesnt live with us... i dont think hed like me very much. since there are rules and regulations in our household.... and hes deff not use to that. 
i sound like a bitch yes, but i can bet anyone that gws son WILL BE a juvenile deliquent. as being one myself as a teenager i know that he will be, there are warning signs already... so yes im going to be extra over protective with my children bc i dont want them thinking his behavior is okay. and since his grandparents are total idiots and dont know what their doing raising a kid in 2007, its not back in the 70's... then gws son deff has odds stacked agaisnt him. days like today make me think if i really want to deal with gws parents or son for the rest of my life. why should i? we live a perfectly great life without the 3 of them around... once his parents/son are involved then all hell breaks out. so yes i do think about haing days like this for the next 20 yrs and regreting it everytime. 
i guess to sum it all up i have a lot of anger built up inside. and it eaks me when gws parents come over to my apartment and think they can be assholes. lol. and seeing how gws son acts.... well i dont know. its very complicated and really in reality too complicated for me. i want a simple life. sooner or later gw will have to choose which kind of lifestyle he wants."

"event","hmm, well today has been quiet so far. when i went to check my bank account on the phone i realized my cell phone had no mintues, so i had to refill. but no calls since. im assuming gw's parents have made it back to maine. but gw had to work today and has tomorrow off, which is good and bad. i really get tired of being in the house so much so i look forward to his days off so he can take me to some stores, of course i spend money lol. but anyhow i told him yesterday he cant blame me for being anxious to get out, I DONT have a car that works thanks to VIP. so why shouldnt i be anxious on his days off for him to take me to the mall, or walmart or even the christmas tree shop... which i havent been to yet up here but im excited to see it. im jealous my mother said she was going there today in NH, god id love to go... especially since my bank account has some money money in it for me to spend lol. :) anyhow so tomorrow id like to go to the christmas tree shop or somewhere... i love picking things up for the apartment. at walmart i picked up some more apple themed things like pot holders, kitchen towels and a apple rug. oh and table cloth which i just put on my table, had to put the middle piece back in... got the table cloth too big for the small table... gws coming home for lunch... g2g and make fooooooddddd. 
hmm lunch is over and spongebob has been on for like 3 hrs straight. i&nbsp; love spongebob though. lol. plus most of his episodes are pretty good compared to some other cartoons that are on tv that i dont agree with. well not much else is happening here today. i have more house cleaning to do and some pictures to post. gw and i took natalie/matthew to the playground saturday night, plus the pizza joint which didnt impress me at all. 
oh and made peace with the young lady that i was fueding with. lol silly petty things that i get myself into.
ps
i had to sing for gw last night... ahhh god i dont know why i get so nervous singing but it inspired me to think about putting up a youtube clip of me singing... there is a girl on there that sings beyonce and she is fairly good, i guess she competes against others, maybe i should go ahead and try."

"event","thank god today is saturday... no thank god for gw's parents coming back to maine though. ahhhh not excited about that. well gw is sticking to his story that these ""girls"" logged or actually hacked into his email account and wrote a fake email and started talking to me to ruin our relationship. lol, lmfao. like im going to believe that. whats sick about the whole thing is that he really wants me to believe it, and hes not telling the truth or going to tell the truth no matter what. for what reason, i dont know, i already knew the truth i just needed to hear it from him.&nbsp; i think he has some inner problems that i never knew about until now. if he needs or feels he needs to lie that badly about something that is really kind of stupid and petty then i dont know, he needs some help i guess. i guess i always thought gw would tell the truth no matter what but now i second guess myself and tend to believe that there is more to him than i know of. i know for a FACT that his parents have some issues but i didnt think gw did i just thought he needed to be away from his parents and he'd snap back into a normal human being but no no no i really think they all are looney. especially the men in his family.
well i wanted to go back to massachusetts, i still do, i DID put car up for sale on craigs list. and i do intend to sell it and put the money towards my ""massachusetts"" account. i would move without gw if i could, whats the point of bringing him if i cant trust him anyway. i can leave without him and still have the same worries as i do now but ill be where i want to be. i just feel that gw isnt taking this as seriously as he should, i know he didnt have sex or anything lol it was just a ""sexy"" convo but come on you'd think you'd be able to admit to that if you had done it without making up some kind of sick ass story that these girls were out to get him and hacked into his account on purpose.&nbsp; someone tell me im not the crazy one but he is.???
i guess aliens are coming too right gw?
i try to think of all the good times we've had together, i guess thats how i tell myself we're meant to be. and thats how i convince myself that we've been through harder days so this wont hurt us. but it is hurting us. like for example last night we went to walmart, on the way home in the truck natalie was tired so gw said to put on the channel that we listen to at night when we're sleeping which is classical music. lol i laugh bc i never imagined any guy, a guy like gw listening to classical music with me and appreciating the music like i do. it kind of made me think that maybe gw is the one for me bc i dont know who else would do that. i know it sounds petty and kind of gay but for real, that is a moment that only gw and i could have shared together and i dont know if i could with anyone else. i also know that gw would die for me, and i would do the same for him. i know he'd cross the ocean and back for me without even asking why.&nbsp; and i think of what a struggle we went through in everett living at chris's house. we went to homeless shelters to eat dinner with natalie bc we were so poor and i dont think i could have done that with anyone else but him. we cried, we went hungry, we smelled really bad together and the point of it was that we stuck together.&nbsp; we went through a horrible time then, the worst ive ever been with gw. we were poor living in everett, ma in a apartment that had no stove, or shower or no tv. just a fridge, sink and a toilet. we slept on the floor on a horrible matress and were tucked away in one room the size of an average living room, we had everything we owned plus toys for natalie stuck in that room. it was during the winter and house was so poorly insulated and the windows would rattle with the wind, we would all huddle together to keep warm. the stink of cigeratte smoke would travel upstairs from chris's father downstairs. we couldnt drive bc we had no money for gas. gw couldnt find a job anywhere, we walked to one of those agencies one day and they wanted gw to work for like $7 an hr and to start at like 5:30 am and get home real late. he didnt take the job, should have but didnt. he ended up getting a job which saved our asses. and then we started doing well. at this whole time i was pregnant with matthew, our son. i didnt know how we were going to make it if he didnt get the job he did. but the point of all that is that we made it through together. we were the strongest we've ever been at that point together. if i could have went through that with him then we can go through anything....
only time will tell how far we're going to go. i did say to gw that we have some things to work out before we buy a house together and we should discuss the next step in our relationship... like marriage. i sound so stupid saying that but we've been together for a while. i think we just need to grow up and realize we cant play kid games anymore. im still so young, sometimes its hard for me to grow up."

"event","okay its official, he was talking to some girls online. AHHHH i dont know what im going to say or do but i want to throw up all over myself right now. is that okay? god am i over reacting about this issue, HE LIED to me... totally lied to me. this means he could be lieng about everything and last night when he promised he wouldnt break my heart he lied. god i have 2 kids with him and hes a freakin loser. how am i suppose to act? he lied to me about talking to the girls... went on about how i was crazy and shit but in reality knew he had and knew i had caught him and now i find out he really did talk to them and i feel like i want to throw up. how am i suppose to trust anything he says if he lies about something as stupid as this. why couldnt he just say yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i talked to girls blah blah blah. but no he made it out like i was lieing and i was stupid. fuck that. im not the type of girl to be lied to or tricked into things. i caught his ass bc i emailed back the ladies and asked for a copy of his email and guess what!!!! they sent me one. boooooo yahhhhh. hes caught. 
ill say it right now i put my car up for sale on craigs list for a grand. hope it sells, i swear if he denies this still after i prove to him and if i dont like his apology im taking that money and moving myself and MY kids back to massachusetts. quote me, im not lieing. (if your wondering how my broke ass could do it, i&nbsp;can get a&nbsp;job translating for the deaf&nbsp;for at least $75 an hr in the massachusetts area, $100 an hr for boston.) &nbsp;if he lies about this then who knows what else hes lied about. i will ruin his life... take everything he loves and cares for away from him and make my kids and i have a great life without his shit. god i hate him so much right now, i hate him and his fuckin hill billy family. how do i end up with scum bags? 
ruthie now i know why you never liked gw, keep him away from philip bc gw is trash and philip dont need a friend who is&nbsp;a scum bag like this. believe me, i always knew you and philip were better than gw just could never figure out why philip&nbsp;kept being friends with gw."

"event","hmm the 4th of july??? well the day for us started out late since we all slept in until about 1pm. lol how crazy is that huh? the night before gw and i stayed up really late playing family fued online... we've become addicted. since playing poker online has died down we need to find something else to do that was fun. whats silly is that we signed up and payed for a month subscription. lol we feel like losers playing it for hours and talking to the ppl in the chat room... cheering on our team :). anyhow we woke up late and then got ready to go to bangor for some shopping. we went to lunch at ruby tuesdays and then went to sears where i blew $60 some dollars on 2 pairs of jeans, glo jeans and levis and one pair of casual pants along with another button up sweater. adds to my new wardrobe my mother got for me. oh and picked up another pair of the white stag sandles at wal mart. LOVE THEM... they are like slippers on my feet.
well we didnt get to see any fireworks yesterday but we were to tired to go anywhere after we all got home, which was late. so i dont have any nice pics to put up. but im sure with days coming ill have some nice pics.
gw's parents are officially in MO now and im hoping they will stay there past this weekend into next week. gives us the weekend and gws day off to ourselves. forgot some items at wal mart and need to go food shopping... and a much needed major house cleaning. i should say apartment cleaning :)
thinking of that i should be cleaning up right about now anyway...."

"event","just got back from matthew's doctor's visit... went well. matthew is 17lbs 26 inches long.... big boy and is sooo cute. i can start feeding him mushy foods like potatoes, applesauce and such. im excited, i decided im going to make all homemade baby food for matthew. i didnt do that with natalie i bought store food which is good too, i just thought it would save us money and all the nice farmers markets would have some great veggies and fruits to mash up for him. plus at the same time im supporting our local farmers, how corny do i sound lol. im sooo far from the perfect housewife/perfect mommmy. i just sound like i can fit into that box sometimes, at least i have the ideas and heart. i will deff make my own baby food though and keep nursing matthew. anyone who is thinking of nursing should, it has been the best experience ive had. matthew and i have bonded so well and we are really close and he really thrives off touch and comfort. i nursed my first born for 3 weeks but she wasnt taking as well bc she was so small and didnt have the technique os sucking yet. but forget about it matthew is the ulimate eater lol... hes a good boy. slept with us again last night after i attempted to get him to sleep in his crib :( i was like errr but couldnt resist snuggling with him, i just sleep like a hot dog all night lol. he loves sleeping with us though, likes to be close and comforted... prob all the body heat helps too. it has been a little chilly at night lately, suprising for summer. still have the winter comforter on the bed bc at night it gets chilly maybe thats bc we're next to the ocean and the ocean breeze cools everything down. that is one of the nicer parts of living here is that we're right next to the ocean... oh and the lobster pound was great. i have never been to seafood restuarant that was as great as the lobster pound. and the view was incredible... beautiful right on the ocean... but cold lol :) if my parents ever make their way here ill deff take them to the lobster pound... they will love it.&nbsp; 
well didnt make the post office today :( im sad about that. and with tomorrow being a holiday i dont know when im going to get there. my poor parents are waiting for the picture of the kids. oh and gw's parents left last night. THANK GOD. i guess their in pennsylvania right now keeping on track to MO.&nbsp; im just happy we get to celebreat the 4th without them. i guess there are some parades and such tomorrow that i hope to hit up and see. ill make sure to snap a lot of pics and post them on here. if anyone is interested. :)&nbsp; 
im suddenly extremely tired, did i mention matthew got shots... hes a little grumpy now and in need of some mommy love and comfort."

"event","didnt really post yesterday except for the new slide that i put up. that took me long enough lol after that i came down with a horrible headache. i finally got some kind of device to put my pics on my comp, it cost me like $21.99 @ best buy though. i must have thrown down a hundred or more yesterday just going to Wal mart, jcpenny and best buy. big spending yesterday.... gw was a little bitchy bc he hates going to wal mart with me bc i always spend money but that was MY money that i spent not his.... even though we really share our money but in reality he wasnt actually paying with it with his pay check. anyhow he went to his parents house for the rest of the day. took the kids to see a movie, um that chef rat movie, i forget the name. he got home a little later on in the evening... i did some laundry for the work week ahead and then fell fast asleep on the couch bc of my headache. oh did a little picture hanging since we picked up the portraits yesterday, still have to send out my moms portrait to her. (one of nat and matt together) oh and if you read this ruthie i have wallet size now ill send you philip one. :) i have to be able to get to the post office lol, im going to try tomorrow when we go for matthews appt. anyhow, got a little snappy last night with gw... well actually he did with me and then i just ignored him. called me a bitch like 20 times for who knows why, prob bc he lost at poker all night. went to bed a little angry but then he rolled over and kind of not really said sorry... then this morn expected me to get his clothes ready for work??? huh? okay yeah right, i was still pissed and he just brushed off the fact he called me a bitch like all night.
matthew slept with us again almost all night last night... omg help, nat never slept in bed with us she still doesnt. but matt loves to sleep next to me. i dont want him growing up sleeping in bed with us bc thats just not okay with me. once in a while i dont mind a little snuggle but not every night, ruins any romance gw and i have huh?
gws parents are leaving for MO either tomorrow or the 4th, im hoping tomorrow since i want to do other stuff than see them on the 4th. lets hope hope hope lol... they leave tomorrow. they are soooo slow so it takes them a yr to just make a decision or a move. the 4th would be much better if gw, matt, nat and i could go shopping in bangor instead of having to plan our day around them. a lot of sales, like sears, jcpennys."

I just got out of the hospital again.......  I woke up last Sunday with a really bad stomach ache and had to be rushed into the emergency room. Not fun. When I got there it turns out my liver bile ducts are infected so now I am on another pill (oh yeah how fun) and they had to stick a needle in the side of my rib cage because they though a pocket of fluod was there. Turns out there was no fluid it was just a hard pocket so they suck the needle in me for nothing! I have not had a very good week. I miss u all and I want to see you all real soon!

"event","Hello everybody! I am really sorry that I haven't written in a long time but guess what I got a call last week on thursday that my liver was in and I had to come into the hospital. The next day I got my liver transplant. The liver came from a 17 year old girl. That really made me sad to hear that but that girl saved my life and the life of a baby. I got part of the liver(the biggest) and a baby at Childrens Hospital got another part of the liver.
 Well I guess this is a good way to start off the New Year lol. Anyway I just want to let you all know I am still at the hospital and I am doing just fine. I am a little sore and extremley exhausted but thats ok. My scar is pretty cool it almost looks like a Mercedes Benz symbol lol. I am in my hospital room and i have access to the internet in my room so goody! 

I also heard that you people got the day off from school today YEAHHHH! That a day off for you and one less day to make up for me :)

Well I just wanted to let everyone know so they wouldn't worry and i miss u all like crazy and i can't wait to see you all again.

"event","Ok well today had to have been the worst day of my life! I am cryin my eyes out. It seems like none of my friends want to be around me and they hate me or something. I was suppose to go over one of my friends houses today and they promised to call and I wasted my whole day waiting by the phone to go over their house, and they never called. The last time I heard from them was 3:00pm and it is now 7:30pm. I just want to runaway and sometimes I don't know why I bother stayin here there really is no reason....... 

Also my other friend hardly even talk to me I was standing right behind them and they totally ignored me. It feels like everyone hates me and I would rather die than lose my friends."

"event","Well lately I think i've been thinking 2 much (don't laugh people, I do think). But really I wish i wasn't because I think about not happy things. I meen lately if u notice everybody is breaking up, and I guess I'm just worried that it's working it's way down to Ashleigh and me. But really I don't want to think that because I really think Ashleigh is the best thing in my life right now, not parkside soccer coming up not anything. So Ashleigh if u read this just please know what I really do love u and that I always will."

"event","Well today was quite an interesting one.. but not interesting like something funny, or something good happened today. Defiantly not, this girl named Tia who now has broken Kris's heart(My Friend) has now broken Erik's heart(also My Friend). But to tell u the truth u could almost see that coming. as u can see below this entry is how i felt about her lastnight. But what i wrote about lastnight is Defiantly the truth. All she seemed to do was flirt with James and Clint. Which in my opinion was definantly pretty screwed up. She should've never done that.. erik is probably one of the nicest people i know.. tia u lost not only a boyfriend but you lost a good person."

"event","Lately there have been many interesting but pain in the butt moments lately. One moment being TIA ALWAYS FLIRTING WITH CLINT AND JAMES which is really really annoying!! U know what Tia if u do that with some boy from Parkside they would certainly leave you all alone and not feel bad about it anything they will say or do to you."

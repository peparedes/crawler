"event","Okai this is quite weird. Am I supposed to write like I'm talking to Hi-de and Hi-de only or, erm hide my affection and talk like this is my other journal? *frown* Quite confused. 

What's with our friends' page? Hahua it's totally blank but it's okai. Must do something bout the userinfo cos it's so freaking short! And, just... <i>there</i>. Must have an impact ma~

I yearn for Milk Girl and a Snickers Yellow Colour now. Hahua~ Shakira's voice is getting a bit too loud. Someone lemme know how I should write in this journal so I can write ""properly"". *grin* 

Er so security level, public or friends or????

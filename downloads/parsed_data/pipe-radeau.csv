"event","Jordan showed his ass really bad last week.  We had gotten back together and things were great for a couple of months.  A coworker of mine approached me and asked me to teach him Magic--after all, I was wearing a Magic: The Gathering t-shirt.  Well, Jordan took this as a sign I was cheating on him.  Why?  Because we stopped having sex.  Maybe if he hadn't let himself go we wouldn't have stopped.  Its one thing to get comfortable and not dress up anymore, but its another to purposely make himself look unattractive.  I mean, did he really have to grow that stupid beard I told him I wouldn't like? 

Our last date was to Skeleton's Lair.  I had a great time but apparently Jordan didn't think so (it came up later in an argument).  The next day I slept too late and as soon as I woke up I was being bitched at for sleeping so long.  My sleep had been interrupted by an hour or so of clanking dishes so I was in no mood for that shit.  Against my better judgement I reminded Jordan that I hadn't ""slept all day"" because of the hour I couldn't sleep due to the noise he had been making.  To that he told me I didn't care about his feelings and blah blah blah.  When he decided to leave I let him go.  I had grown so tired of that sort of nonsense that I just didn't care anymore if he left.

Over the next couple of days Jordan went back on his word to let me use his washer and dryer regardless of what happened with us (one of the conditions on letting him bring them to my apartment).  He threatened to claim I stole the washer and dryer, press harassment charges (despite him not actually leaving me the hell alone), and also told me he would vandalize Jeremy's car and claim I did it.  I found out later he even stole shit from me!  I mean, how childish can you be?  It was his decision to end things over something so incredibly stupid and he had to make my life a living hell afterwards and even stole from me before he got out the damn door.

I've been told by several people that I am much better off.  I honestly do believe it.  The only thing I miss is having someone to talk to about anything whenever I want.  Dealing with all Jordan's crazy shit was not worth that though.

I'm finding myself with more free time on my hands than I am used to.  Its making me feel a little anxious.  I have been able to play League of Legends more but in all honesty I'm not that good.  I get too aggressive or lose my cursor on the screen and then I end up dead.  Other people have tried to help by giving ""advice"" about how to play but I end up doing much worse.  They want me to sacrifice any chances I have to make an impact on the game so their score can look better.  I can't really help them out much mid to late game if I'm 10 levels behind every other champion simply because I've been hiding in the bushes waiting for when they needed me to do most of the damage to ""their"" kills.  About a week or so ago I did have an awesome game where I was allowed to play as I wanted and I ended up carrying the team...I had the most kills by a lot, had fewer deaths than some, and had a good number of assists!  Games like that are rare though.

I now have a cat.  His name is Sherbet and he's orange.  Jordan brought him in one night.  He was hanging out on my porch and looked hungry.  Sherbet has been here every since.  He's actually a pretty great cat.  He goes to the door when he has to use the bathroom and doesn't cause too much destruction around the apartment.  Sherbet even sleeps with me and likes to cuddle.

After wrecking the Grand Am in September I got a new car.  Its a 05 Corolla, white in color.  The previous owner (the only other owner) took great care of it.  The glove box came with receipts of every maintenance job its had.  It runs wonderfully.  I'm happy, though it will cost me a hell of a lot more than any other vehicle I've owned.  I had to take out a loan to pay for it but in doing so I found some false info on my credit report.  Plus the loan is sure to help out my credit score some.

"event","I have an apartment now.  Five minutes from work.  Amazing furniture and the aquarium and computer I have wanted for years.

Things were going great but now my ""roommate"" is moving out.  We have only been here a month.  He stopped talking to me b/c he bought fish for my aquarium that I didn't ask for or want and didn't thank him for doing so.  I also told him he was rude for not inviting me to the pet store when he knew I had been wanting to go for almost 2 weeks.  Then he decided he wanted to pack up his shit and leave b/c I had not reacted the way he wanted me to when he got in a head-on collision and walked away two days earlier.  It was apparently expected of me to leave work early to visit him at the hospital when he seemed fine (considering) when I talked to him on the phone right after it happened.  On my next break he was jacked up on morphine and talking like he was having a damn party at the hospital.  Did I mention I was the first person he called?  He didn't even call the ambulance.  It was the people in the third car involved that was smart enough to actually call for help.

He has played that whole game of ignoring me b/c I have said (or didn't say) or did or (didn't do) something wrong (or that I was supposed to) at least once a week.  I am who I fucking am and I am not going to change for someone else.  If I don't live up to his expectations, then so be it.

"event","Eric and I finally had an intimate moment.  Its been over 2 and 1/2 years since we last hung out.  When I left to come home I went to give him a hug and instead he moved in to kiss me.  We had fooled around earlier in the night (for the first time) but I wasn't expecting a kiss goodbye.

During my drive back I noticed I was completely smitten.  Its been a very long time since I felt this way.  Eric has been a good friend despite us going a long time without talking.  We are so different in many ways yet we've always enjoyed each other's company.

I couldn't help but have a big smile on my face as I was thinking about how Eric kissed me goodbye.  Don't get me wrong, I don't even pretend to think that we're going to date or anything like that.  It was just a really sweet gesture that caught me off guard.  We definitely should have had sex years ago.

Maybe I should have taken Eric up on his offer to stay the night...

We went to dinner at O'Charley's b/c its my favorite restaurant and then we went to see ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"".  That movie was a hell of a lot better than I thought it would be.

On my way back home I stopped to see Billy.  Just last week he tried to contact me after I severed all ties to him b/c of Larry.  Well, Billy and Larry apparently broke up so now it seems Billy wants to talk to me...or so I thought.  He brought some girl with him to meet up with me without even asking how I actually felt about it.  If I had known I would have just headed home.  I didn't even get to say much of anything to Billy b/c he and his friend were too busy talking to each other and texting some guy they both seem to want to get with.  Ugh.

I had a dream about us last night.  We were swimming in a pool--I feel like it was above ground.  You stood in the water as I slowly swam around you.  Somehow the swimming led to a hug and within a few seconds we kissed.  We kissed for a few minutes and then we left the water to dry off and sit on a towel.  There was a slight incline.  I laid my head on your chest and you held me until I woke up.

"event","Man.  Yesterday was a <i>good</i> day.

Sunday I woke up at 9:30 am in a nice hotel room.  The night before was pretty decent, but I didn't actually get much sleep.  I had a nice lunch and then went to Sawyer's house for some Easter festivities.  We started out by playing some Horse and then moved on to some video games after Sawyer thoroughly kicked my ass.  Of course we couldn't finish off the day without some MTG so we played some of that before I left to go to Louisville.

Making a trip to Louisville to visit Travis was on my to-do list for several months now.  After thinking for a few hours that I wasn't going to hear from Travis about whether or not he still wanted me to visit I did actually hear back from him and finally made the trip.

Travis had a couple of other visitors when I arrived at his apartment.  His friends, Dustin and Evan, have been dating for 5 years.  They are such a cute couple.  Anyways, I was barely in the door a full minute (if that) before I had a drink handed to me.  Yep, Travis's drinking habits haven't changed much since EKU.  lol

Eventually either Dustin or Travis ended up getting in touch with some random guy that lived close to Travis's apartment and invited him over.  The guy, Matt, was such a geek like me despite being a ""musician"".  Dustin got sick (he drank too much) and eventually Travis got Matt to leave.  Haha.

Fast forward through the little bit of sleep and recovering from a slight hangover, Travis decided he wanted to go to the mall.  He had traded in his nice big truck for a hot little Mazda 6 since the last time I saw him, and despite Travis not liking it I think it suites him.  I definitely think I want to end up with a Mazda 6 sometime.  Its such a nice car.

Riding through Louisville with the windows down and loud music playing on a warm Spring day was just so exhilarating.  That doesn't even describe it fully.  I felt so incredibly <i>happy</i>.  It had been a long time since I felt that way.  There were a few times I had the urge to hold his hand but that could have ended up being awkward.  Travis is a good friend and it seems I've missed him more than I thought.  I could definitely use more moments like that in my life.

After the mall Travis got a call from his work.  They wanted him to come in on his only day off.  That sucked.  We had a little bit of time to grab some food before he had to go in.  Travis took me to TGI Friday's.  I can't recall ever going there before.  And to my surprise, Travis told the waiter that our food would be together.  His reasoning was that he would be nice and buy my lunch since he had to go to work.  He was right, it was nice of him.

The Grand Am was having a fit on the way back home.  I had to almost constantly pump the gas pedal once I got to Etown.  I think the gas pump is going out or something...maybe the motor.  Flooring it couldn't even give me the acceleration I needed to keep up with traffic.  It is a little funny that pumping the gas built up some speed but flooring it didn't.  Oh well, I made it back and I guess that's good enough.

The house was completely destroyed when I got back.  I'm gone 1 weekend and I have to clear out a huge pile of random shit out from in front of my bedroom door.  I mean, seriously?  And I wasn't even home a full hour until I had to start hearing Gabrielle's incessant crying.  Why can't Bridgette stay within earshot of the child?

Despite having a pretty uninteresting latter-half of the day, I am left feeling like a wave of calm has washed over me.

Did I ever tell you that I thought we would one day get married?  Hell, I not only thought it but I was <i>planning</i> it.  I honestly believed we would spend the rest of our lives together.

Do you know I sometimes wear that shirt you gave me?  I hate the way that ugly t-shirt fits.  But I love the shirt because it was yours and you gave it to me.  It makes me feel closer to you just having it on.

I still have the letters/notes you wrote to me.  Somehow I knew that if I threw them away I would regret that decision eventually.

There is even a reminder I left myself on the dry-erase board about you.  Its been there since the summer and I don't plan on erasing it.  Come to think of it, it's probably been there so long that it's permanently stained the board.  Granted I haven't constantly paid it any attention, I do see it every day.

I could go on and on about all the things I miss about you--like watching bad kids' shows, the way you were super cheesey, how you would look at me with frustration when I would wake you up suddenly--but what's the point?  You aren't going to read any of this and no one that will read this will tell you about it.  Actually, I kind of wish you would read this or that someone would tell you about it.  Somehow I feel like if you knew then maybe things would be different.

Whatever happened to the promises we secretly made to each other?  You know, about how we would someday be together again and happy?  When does <i>someday</i> become <i>today</i>?

Of all the people that could have randomly messaged me, Billy was the one to start a conversation with me when I really needed to talk to someone.  And he allowed me to vent and even took the time to call me while he was at work.

Billy's message was to inform me that he created a ""Designated Chair Location"" or DCL for short.  The humor of that remark comes from when we dated.  One night Billy's shoes were not where I thought they were supposed to be.  I mentioned this to him and he apologized for not having his shoes in the designated shoe location.  That was a very random thing for Billy to remember tonight, but I am glad he did.

I've given him a lot of shit over the past year and a half, but I can honestly say he's been there more than I expected.

"event","Sam is just stupid.  We were finally starting to have what seemed like a good friendship.  Then that all went away.  Ok, I can see why he might assume I wanted to get back together with him.  But he has no fucking right to  confront me with that assumption and then in the process reject me.  I mean fuck!  I wanted sex.  Not a shady, cheating boyfriend.  I've already had way too many of those.  Yeah, I'm probably never going to see that $22 I spent on antifreeze and oil for Sam again.  If I was a mean person I would suggest I should have just left him on the side of the road.  Maybe I should be mean.  He did send me out to buy both without even checking to see if the car needed either.  For the record, it didn't even need the oil.

My father has got to be the most infuriating person on the planet.  I swear if I hear him say, ""Well what are they for if not to spoil?"" just one more time I will lay the old man out.  I am so damn tired of him bitching and threatening me when I make Georgia mind.  The ONLY person that can say anything to me about how I discipline Georgia is Bridgette.  At least I actually give a damn about Georgia's health and don't let her run around hog wild with no rules and no limitations.  If it was up to him Georgia would most likely never go to school, eat real food, or wear any clothes.  A 4 year old child should not be running around in just a pair of panties eating nothing but popsicles.  Its down right disgusting.  Bridgette wasn't too happy when he claimed that he would take Georgia and move somewhere else.  She's upset b/c our father only acts like he has 1 grandchild when he has 3 living in the same house as him.  Not to mention how the whole kidnapping thing is illegal.

And my dad thinks I give a damn if he cuts me out of his will.  I mean, hello!  Every fucking penny he would get out of his life insurance is owed to the bank and Doug C.  I mean shit!  I already own his damn truck (maybe I should use that against him) because he had a lawsuit against him from a gas station in town due to him buying too much stuff on credit that he couldn't pay back.  His answer to that was to just stop going there.  It was like he thought they would just forget.  Stupid old man.  I've never gotten anything out of him my entire life.  Why the hell does he think I would want or expect anything from him after he's dead?

As a side note, I got severely pissed when my dad decided that I should already be in Nashville.  And he's right.  I should be.  And I'm sure as hell not looking back when I do.  Bridgette and I are the only kids he has that have anything to do with him.  And that's sadly going to change real soon.  I'll move out whenever I can.  Then its only a matter of time before Bridgette does the same (she's been planning it too).

"event","Sometimes I just want to scream at the top of my lungs.  Not because I'm angry but because I want some specific people to listen.  There is just so much I want to say.  It seems that no matter how hard I try I can never get it all out.

Several months ago I decided I would give Billy a second chance.  But I was too late.  Billy had moved on and had another new boyfriend and I had no idea.  Well, since then I've tried to just not think about Billy that much and I would get angry whenever Billy mentioned his boyfriend, Larry.  I thought I would get over it when I started dating Bruce but since things with Bruce didn't pan out I found myself still sad about Billy.  At least for a while anyways.  The more that I have talked to Billy the past few weeks the more that I have realized that I just cannot compete with Larry.  He's young, he's clingy, he lives in Richmond, he cheated on Billy, and he gets along with all of Billy's friends no matter how asinine they are. I'm older, need my space, am moving to Nashville, never cheated on Billy (although I thought about it to ""get back"" at Billy), and I have yet to meet one of Billy's friends that did not come off as a bitch.

You know, I'm fine with that now.  I'm happy for Billy that he found someone.  I once told Billy that we would end up together in the end.  As each day goes by and we become more and more distant the reality that that is just not the case becomes more obvious.  Billy has moved on.  I finally do believe that I am doing the same.  Personally, I even think Billy and Larry are a cute couple.  lol

I will always wonder if the ""punishment"" I decided to give Billy was a mistake. In all actuality I had intentions of getting back together with Billy a long time ago.  Whenever I was ready to give Billy another chance he would do something to piss me off again.  Well, he wouldn't just piss me off as much as he would all of a sudden decide that he no longer wanted to be with me because he found someone else to fuck for a few weeks.  When he started dating Larry I assumed it would be the same thing.  But I don't think the end of their relationship will be the same.  If they ever do break up, I don't think there will ever be another time I would be willing to take Billy back despite somewhat regretting not doing so sooner.  He said he thinks we work best as friends.  Someday we'll see how true that is, but I no longer believe we'll have another shot at a relationship.  There is just no use in waiting around for something like that.

--

I've decided that I need to finally reconcile some conflicting attitudes and beliefs.  There are way to many situations that make me angry when I should just be happy.  I think in my quest to be different or not a stereotype I have abandoned some things that I shouldn't have.  There is no reason for me to be bitter or angry over something that I have somehow believed will make me something other than who I am.  I am who I am and I like what I like so I shouldn't feel like I have to be a certain way.  If there was one thing I learned in Psychology it is that conflicting feelings never lead to good ends.

Sam came to visit yesterday.  It was planned at the last minute while we were talking on YIM sometime between 4 and 5 am.  My idea about reconciliation was something that has been floating around in my head for a while.  However, Sam asked me a very straight-forward question during our early morning conversation and my answer changed after he proposed 1 differing variable.  It shouldn't have.  That was my clue that I need to change my beliefs to match my values.  Honestly speaking, I think I might like Sam's help in doing so.  He's very honest about what he wants and doesn't seem to be too concerned when he wants something that most people wouldn't agree with.  And that's perfectly ok.  I want that sense of harmony.

Anyways, Sam's visit was fun albeit very short.  He got here sometime around 4:30 and left a little before 8.  :(  We only played a little bit of video games and then just sat on my bed and talked for a while.  It was really good seeing him.  After he left his car gave him problems outside Columbia so called and asked me to save him.  I rushed to Columbia and brought him some stuff he needed for his car and then we ended up just talking for a bit in his car.  I assume it was when he was ready to head on back home he gave me a hug and a tender kiss on the cheek that slowly moved to a kiss on the lips.  I forgot how good of a kisser he was.  And ironically enough Sam said the same thing about me.  :)

Seeing Sam again stirred up all kinds of old emotions again.  I don't know if they will last or not though.  When Jeremy came back last night just after Sam left he knocked on the front door and I did get very excited thinking that it was Sam coming back...lol  I also got way excited when Georgia came into my room to tell  me that Sam wanted to talk to me (on the phone).  Haha...it almost feels like I'm in love again.  But maybe I just always have to have romantic feelings for someone and Sam was the perfect candidate due to developments with Billy and Bruce.  I am happy that I can talk about certain things with Sam without getting upset or angry like before.  That is very nice.  We both have grown as people it seems.

My techno geek side has taken over lately.  A couple of weeks ago I decided to finally root my phone and then install a custom a ROM called Bugless Beauty.  Its actually really nice.  :)  There were a couple of things I didn't like though.  For example, it left the battery meter the same and I found it to be a little boring.  It also installed an IM app that called the Google Talk notification icon which I thought was dumb.  Not to mention that it also removed the Car Home background.  I managed to change all of that and it made me happy that I could.  Friday I decided to spend the better part of the day seeing how hard it would be to unroot and revert my phone back to stock Android 2.0.1.  It wasn't hard at all, but it took me longer than it should have to reflash the original boot animation.  Despite really liking the new ROM I'm afraid I'll get too used to it.  My mind still isn't made up if I want to keep it or not.  Having a phone with an open source OS is pretty amazing though.  Regardless, I love that I do have the option to do such things.

"event","Bruce and I finally had the conversation that I have been putting off for a while.  I finally came out and told him that I was bitter about the first time we met and that I was just waiting for him to tell me I wasn't black enough for him.  To be perfectly honest, I don't know why I even bothered.  In the following months I will be living in Nashville and he's trying to move to Pennsylvania.  A relationship between us wouldn't work obviously.  So it became official that we are ""date buddies"". Yeah, I don't know if that will work for me.  I guess as long as he pays for the dates I won't complain.  I just need to remember not to get attached and that we're just friends and having some sort of sick, twisted fun before we go our separate ways...ugh.

Anyways, tonight because of the crap with Bruce I broke down and fully realized what I want in life.  Mostly what I want is to just be with someone that wants to be with me.  That doesn't have to mean dating but doesn't exclude it either.  I think that's why the idea of moving to Nashville seems so appealing to me--Sawyer to some extent wants to live there with me.  While I'm at home, Bridgette isn't living here because she wants to live with me, she is living here because this is her home too.  Bridgette and I both living in the same house has little to do with the fact the other is but is actually because it belongs to both of us and neither of us has anywhere else to go.  Don't get me wrong, its not like I particularly want to get away from home and from Bridgette, but I just feel like I need to go out on my own in the world (sort of).  Living with Bridgette feels very similar to roommates in college...its like we were assigned to each other and just making due.  Of course its also very different because she is my sister.

There needs to be some form of stability in my life.  I want some job security.  I want a place to call my own...some place I've built on my own instead of being handed over to me because of a tragedy.  I want a car that isn't shitty and was handed over to me for free.  Living completely by myself is out of the question in this stage of my life.  I'm always too lonely and really need the company.  So I want someone to live with that wants to live with me as well.  I know I'm always whining about some stupid shit, but I honestly feel like all of that would make a world of difference to me.

"event","Sawyer and I went apartment shopping in Nashville Thursday.  Yes, we are probably going to end up moving to Nashville soon and being roommates.  Sawyer's choices of apartments were quite questionable to say the least.  The first one I randomly decided to get directions to was sort of nice.  Well, not really nice but pretty average at least.  The other 3 options Sawyer came up with were pretty ghetto.  I guess that happens when you are on a budget.  Some quick internet usage on my part led us to an apartment that we will probably end up getting.  They have a pool and are within our budget.  Oddly enough, that apartment is just down the road from the first one we looked at.

Andrea is supposedly going to be trying to get us jobs at the Gaylord Opry Mills Hotel (since that is where she works).  That would be cool.  But then again, I was looking online and found a few other jobs that were interesting.  I found one for dryer vent/air duct cleaning that is supposed to pay $800 a week and provides training and only requires a high school diploma.  That can't be bad, right?  Another job I could do at home and makes $1500 a month if I meet the quota.  Its a data clerk job.  I'd probably go with that one simply because I wouldn't have to leave the apartment to work.  Would that make me a shut-in?  Eh, I'll just have to make sure I get out to watch movies and stuff every week.  With about $700 extra to spend each month, I'm sure I could do plenty of social stuff...lol

This coming Saturday Sawyer and I are going to a Pro Tour Qualifier for Magic in Lexington.  The tournament is Extended format and the top prize is an invitation and airfare to PTQ San Juan.  I'm really excited but I'm not expecting to do well.  The deck I'm taking is a red/white agro deck I've been fooling with since Ravnica.  Personally, I believe it is one of my best decks.  Its original form did quite well consistently against most match ups.  So far Sawyer has discovered my deck's Achilles Heel.  My red/white deck, which I will probably end up calling ""Garth"", simply cannot win against decks that pump out lots of tokens.  Sawyer has a white soldier deck that always slaughters Garth; the mass amount of tokens generated is no match for Garth's burn spells.  A popular deck in the format generates lots of thopter tokens and (I assume) makes them bigger using Tezzeret's ultimate ability.  That would be a problem for me.  But hopefully Garth can be fast enough to win before those decks get going.  If worse comes to worse I can take a recent creation of mine, a mono black vampire deck, to the next PTQ and see if it does better than Garth.

Things seem to be falling into place for me and it makes me happy.  I've been getting to the point again where I want to feel something ""new"".  The point where Campbellsville (or wherever I am) is just way too familiar and stale.  The point where I want to be able to go somewhere close by and it be completely new and different.  Going to Nashville gave me a little escape that I needed.  Hopefully things will work out with moving there and hopefully I'll like the place even more once there.

I'm starting to enjoy being home, though sometime I feel like a bum.  I did some cleaning lately though you can't actually tell.

I have a love-hate relationship with Billy still.  We aren't ""friends"" any place online but we talk on Skype several times a week...lol  I think we work best that way.  I had a dream the other night that I found a jar of change while cleaning Bridgette's room (which actually happened) and that I took it to a CoinStar and it was worth $78 and some change.  For some reason I decided to call Billy in my dream to tell him about it.  Weird, eh?

Joe has been trying to get back together with me.  He's sort of backed off a little since I've mostly been needing to save my gas and money for my cell phone bill and the Zendikar prerelease the 26th.  I might go see him soon though.  He's sort of going a through a tough time since he just had his surgery and he can't do much walking or driving for a while.

Coming back from Bowling Green the other day I hot-air balloons filling the sky.  I immediately felt like a little kid again and became incredibly giddy.  It was pretty much one of the most amazing sights ever.  I don't know why I liked it so much.  The desire to go up in a hot-air balloon pretty much filled me entirely.

I'm sure I've said this before, but I love Johnathan.  I don't know how to describe it.  We've had an interesting friendship to say the least.  But I'll probably never tell him how I feel...things are perfectly fine how they are."

There are people that I just think about.  And there are people that make me sad.  There are just a few people that actually make me happy though.  My problem lies with the ones that make me sad.

I can see this progression of change  They go from what they were when I knew them to something completely different.  And that often entails me not being a part of what they currently are.

For instance, I'm looking at photographs of Sam.  I can remember how he was so innocent, nice, fun, and just wonderful to be around.  He was shy yet so incredibly attractive and easy going.  Now we don't even talk, but he's so outgoing and somewhat wild.  He's still nice, fun, and attractive, but now he's wild and always on the go.  I don't know what happened to him.  But I know it didn't involve me.  Sam is out living his own life with all of his friends having a great time, and I'm sitting here feeling down thinking about what I'm missing out on.

I wanted to be <i>his</i> friend.  I wanted to be the <i>other</i> guy in those pictures.  I wanted to be the one to hear him say, ""I love you,"" every night before we went to sleep.  Truth is, I still love him.

Throughout my dating life, I have had several really good opportunities.  Joe L. was my best friend.  I truly loved everything about Sam.  Chris was pretty much perfect in every way.  Hell, even Billy had good potential.  For some reason I can't keep myself from thinking that things with Joe M. could have been great if we both would have done a few things differently.  And I even have a damn crush on a person I never met and only talked to online a couple of years ago...and he stopped returning my messages long ago.

But I'm over Joe L.  I'm not the one that can tame Sam.  Chris is almost too good for me anyways.  Billy and I are stuck as friends.  And I can't talk to Joe M. without one of us getting pissed off at the other somehow.

Maybe one day I'll recognize a good opportunity when I see it and not fuck it up.

After my last incident with Joe, I decided I was going to let him talk to me if he wanted to.  That didn't go very well.

I decided about 5 days was long enough to wait before I would flat out ask him if he was going to talk to me again.  He said he was.  That was bullshit really.  He meant he was wanting to make me feel like shit again.

Joe got online after just a few texts earlier in the day and decided to IM me.  After some idle chit chatting, we got to the point.  He apologized for being so rude, but it was only half-assed.  He made sure to say that it wasn't <i>always</i> correct for him to be the way he was and that he could see how I would take it the wrong way.  Yada yada yada.  Even when he fucking claims to be apologizes he doesn't actually do it and manages to make it seem like he honestly believes I am at fault but is apologizing to smooth things over.

I began talking about Billy towards the end of our conversation and mentioned our fight <b>once</b> after he apologized he claimed that I was, ""still caught on that.""  Joe then promptly signed offline without saying bye after claiming he was only trying to apologize and be mature about it.  It sure is mature to just end the conversation whenever you want and not even tell anyone.  That was the equivalent of hanging up the phone.  Fucking asshole.

Of course I had to send Joe some text messages asking him why he got off and the like.  We began to argue about how he doesn't even try to treat me like a friend.  Then I gave him two options:  to  make things better or to just say goodbye.  He chose the later it seems.  I'm beginning to get a more accurate picture of his personality.  Honestly, I'm starting to believe that he <b>is</b> immature, rude, and not worth loving.  Really, I hoped for so much more from him and expected a lot more than I got.  I was stupid for wasting so much time and money on someone that just wanted to use me for what he could get.

Since Wednesday, Billy and I have spent almost every day together.  After Biology lab, I asked Billy for a ride back to my dorm.  We went to McDonald's to eat since we were both hungry and the past few days just sort of fell into place.  If Billy didn't spend the night in my dorm since Wednesday, then I have spent the night in his apartment.  That was definitely something I never saw coming.

To make things even more awkward, its actually been a lot of fun spending time with Billy.  I had so many bitter feelings towards him and never wanted to talk to him at all at one point.  But now, I remember why I dated him in the first place and he doesn't try to constantly keep my pissed off like Joe does.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think I would ever date Billy again, but his friendship is nice.  :)

At least despite all the shit that happened between me and Billy, Billy actually tries to have a good friendship with me.  He seems to actually give a damn about my feelings and what I want to do.  And because of that, we have had a lot of fun this weekend.  If only Joe would put forth half the effort Billy does, then Joe and I could actually be friends.

--

The bright side of all that has happened in the last week is that I have my friends back on campus, and if Joe really wants me out of his life then I'm not going to cry about it since he has only been proving the negative things I have been saying.  Its almost as if things will go back to the way they were before the big fight and I can just forget all the shit that happened with Joe actually happened.

I cannot describe how sick I am of feeling like shit because of him.  Joe thinks its perfectly fine to make rude little comments about me as long as he has a smile on his face while doing so.

He keeps trying to justify it by saying he's not insulting me or making rude comments, but I know better than that.    For example, my breath does NOT constantly smell bad when I brush my teeth 3 times and only have 1 meal while I'm with him.  Do you really need to compare my breath to a fart when I brushed them just an hour before?  And no, Joe, your apartment smells like fucking dog piss (which would make sense since your damn dog pissed on the carpet all the damn time), not like my breath.  Of all the most immature and asinine things to tell someone.  Seriously, I brush my teeth like 3-4 times a day and I'm lucky if I see him brush his once in a 2 day period and yet I'm the one with bad breath?  And its an everyday thing with him.  Fuck you Joe.  Maybe you're smelling your own rotten breath.

Joe also sat there and told me he wouldn't mind having a roommate in Las Vegas and it would be easier on both of us if I wanted to move there b/c we could split the rent.  And he talked about how he might need to take my car to work since he wouldn't have one and it would be hard to get to the hospital he wants to work at by bus.  Then one day up and change his mind and come off with, ""Well, I think I want to live alone but it would be cool if you wanted to come and live on the same floor of the same apartment building as me.""  Really?  That's how you tell me you changed your mind about being roommates?

He's a childish, selfish, asshole.  If only he wasn't so good at pretending not to be most of the time.

Joe told me tonight that he was moving to Las Vegas.  That was my fresh start, not his.

I'm not over him yet.

I guess I expected to be able to get away from everything.  Him telling me that he was moving to the place I wanted to made me feel betrayed.  Joe knew I wanted to go there.  Should I be ok with the thing I'm trying to get away from getting to where I want to go first?

Is it just me or are champagne bottles hard to open?  It could have been the cups of vodka and gin I drank before hand though.

Joe probably doesn't realize how I feel right now.  I had the best thing in the world and I was forced to let it go.  Now I can't even have my fresh start because he beat me to it.  Everyday I would be reminded that he was somewhere in the same city.  And what would happen when I met someone that had already met him?  If only I had the means to go there right now...nobody could say that I followed him there.

As much as I don't want to, I still love him.  That's a hard thing to admit:  that you still love your ex fiance that ended the relationship because you tried to tell him you were upset that he didn't do a simple sexual act that he promised he would and it made it mad.

Yes, he was selfish, but hopefully not entirely on purpose.

I dont know what to do.  If I moved somewhere else or even stayed here I would still be reminded that I wasn't in Las Vegas because of Joe.  I'm stuck. I can't win.  I have to feel like this until I'm over him.

I wanted to spend my life with Joe.

How long will it take befoe I move on?  The fact that he has moved on so quickly and already made his plans to start over make me feel like I didn't mean a fucking thing to him.  I was nothing.  Just an insignificant blink of an eye.  To think that I thought he would marry me and we would spend the rest of our lives together.  I was so foolish.

Usually drunk people don't have to fight back tears.  I'm by no means what they call a ""crying drunk"".

I deserve to have what I want at least once in my life.  But I've not so far.  Everything I have is so meaningless.  My friends aren't, but they are all spread so far out and doing their own thing.  The physical closeness won't last much longer.

Maybe I should drift but just start at a different place.

My friend, Lacka, said an amazing thing to me the other day.  As long as we were honest we could talk about anything.  That made me feel so good...and safe.  Its actually hard to explain, but it touched me.  And it's true.  I wish Joe would have felt that way instead of getting mad at me when I tried to tell him I was sexually frustrated.

I want so much for things to be like they were.

I've been hopelessly trying to make something happen that I don't believe ever will.  I want Joe to want me.  I try so hard to be what he wants, but te more I try the more I feel like he's over me and the more upset I get.  Joe isn't exactly hurting me anymore; I'm hurting myself really.  I have these stupid little notions that if I show him who I really am that he would want me again.  That he would realize that he loves me back and he wants to be with me too.

It's not working.

Whenever an hour or two goes by and I don't get a response from Joe, a small part of me dies on the inside.  I'm thinking the worse.  But it doesn't even fucking matter what he does b/c I have no right to care.  He's not with me...he's made that perfectly clear that that isn't what he wants and probably never going to happen again.

What should I do?  Everything I try seems to only make him more sure that I am not what he wants.  Everything I do oly seems to knock me two steps back.

There are only a few times in my life in which I wanted to just die.  This is one of them.  Not like commit suidice, but rather I wouldn't be upset (maybe I would be happy even) if I knew I wouldn't be alive much longer.  Of course something unexpecting and out of the blue would be cool too since I wouldn't even have time to even consider dreading it.

Joe's apartment even felt like home.  That's a feeling that I haven't felt in years.

Since Momma's death, my house has become a strange, foreign place.  Never would I have thought the carpet would have come up in the living room, or that the warddrobe in Daddy's bedroom would rust because of bad water pipes, or that cardboard boxes would litter almost every room.  I'm not saying anything bad, a lot of people would be lucky to have what we have.  And Bridgette tries really hard and has done well for herself with our house.  But I feel like my ""home"" and existance have both become this pathetic perversion of what used to be.

I guess I don't like change.

Being with Joe made me feel something I haven't felt in a long time.  I can't even say I felt that way with anyone else in the past 4 years.  I felt like I belonged somewhere...like I had a future...like I was needed...like I was truly loved by another human being for reasons other than family ties.

Champagne tastes not as bad after you've had a few cups of it.

I was so badly to just be hugged be Joe and told that everything will be ok.  That we will be fine.  That I didn't lose hime.  But that's a sad little dream that I'm afraid will never happen.  I might have had a shot at the happiness I want if I only I would have taken a deep breath and a step back like Joe initially wanted.

But I was too heartbroke.

Of course I had to have had things my way.  I had to make Joe decide between the engagement or just friendship; there was no middle ground.  And I got exactly what I deserved.  I pushed Joe further away.

It doesn't matter that I changed my mind.  It doesn't matter that I would date him again even though I said I wouldn't.  It doesn't matter that I would get engaged that 4th time despite the bid deal I made about it.  It doesn't matter that I would do everything in my power to make him as happy as he made me whenver I would wake up next to him.  No, nothing I do fucking matters because I already made the man I loved not want to be with me anymore.

My friends tell me that a month is not long enough to figure out if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone.

A month was perfectly adequate for me to know that I was in love with Joe.  I knew because of how I couldn't help but stare at him and watch him roll out of bed sometimes an hour after I had woken up.  I knew because of how I enjoyed spending every minute with him, even when we were fighting.  I knew when I made a trip to see him at 1 AM because he had a bad night and I wanted to hold him.  I knew because of how I gladly washed his dishes almost every day so we could eat crappy food in his apartment.  I knew because he seemed to understand my craziness.  I knew because I slept so well next to him despite not sleeping at all.  I knew because I already thought of everything we both owned as ours.  I knew because being with him felt like I finally done something right.

Something has to change though.  I just don't know what.

The aquarium was only open for about an hour and a half after we got there since she didn't leave on time.

Anyways, the whole trip to Newport was for my birthday, which of course was Friday.  Bridgette and Joe seemed to have gotten along and everything was pretty smooth.  We saw lots of different kinds of fish, watched some otters play around, got to touch some sharks, and just had a fun time.  Georgia went as well and she loved it.

On the way back to school things got a little rough.  Daddy called to tell us that a storm was on its way.  Joe's parents did the same.  Well, I fell asleep on the way back only to wake up to Bridgette acting like a fool.  She had been ""racing"" three different cars on the way back and Joe mentioned how she had been going 110 MPH down the interstate.  I of course got pissed at that and I cussed Bridgette out for it.

Seriously, why act like you have no sense whatsoever when you have 3 other people in the car with you, especially when one of them is your own fucking daughter?  The entire thing was fucking ridiculous and I'm still very pissed about it.  Bridgette's justification for putting 4 lives in danger was ""some people like having a little bit of fun"".  Stupid stupid stupid.

Joe and I fought some b/c I ""had an attitude"" after the fight with Bridgette.  Apparently I just shouldn't speak after I get annoyed with anyone since I ""always want to fight"".  That fight was just as stupid as how Bridgette was driving when a snow storm was coming.

Due to a few slip-ups of my own throughout the day Joe started fishing for me to tell him I was thinking about marriage or something similar.  He had decided that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and I assume was hoping I felt the same way.  Yes, I was guilty of already having the same kinds of thoughts and after I confirmed it to him Joe decided to propose (this was also after I mentioned how since I've been engaged twice before I would not be the one to ask the third time).  The next morning I said yes.  One day Joseph Bryce M. will be my husband.  :)

At about 3 AM on my birthday I started to get a random call from Josh H.  The entire point of the phone call was so he and my skank of an ex Billy E. could tell me that they were fucking.  Like I give a damn if the two most likely to have an STD people I know are having sex.  Good for them.  I've been trying to cut Billy out of my life since I dumped his ass and then made him move the fuck out of my room.  I'm not terribly upset about it b/c all he is doing is being a pathetic spoiled brat that is kicking and screaming because I have moved on and want nothing to do with him.  I mean really...both of them are so fucking disgusting.  Dur...there was a reason why I didn't want to talk to either of them to begin with...lol

Joe and I spent several hours today looking for rings.  Neither of us have much cash so we couldn't get anything nice.  Well, we couldn't actually get anything at all since the cheapest decent-looking ring we could find was still more expensive than we could afford.  Oh well, hopefully soon we will be able to get a nice pair of engagement rings.  :)

When the third time rolled around after some more arguing, I was so concerned about his motivation (didn't want him to do it just because I felt bad) so I asked too many questions about it so he just wanted to not even bother.

So I pretty efficiently shot down three proposals to have sex with my hot boyfriend that never wants to have sex.  I'm a real loser...

Joe and I have spent every day together since (pretty much) our first date. What is interesting about that is that I greatly despised spending every day with Billy. He would want to spend every waking hour we could together. Even when I went home to get away from him he would call me every night and want to talk for hours and it annoyed me so much. With Joe, I actually want to see him everyday. And I want to spend every night with him too.

For the past week, I have not woken up in my own bed except for today. And that made me sad.

I know I've said this before, but Joe really seems like a great guy. It's the little things he does that gets me. Yesterday, when he was done with class for the day, he decided to come down and see me. He couldn't stay all night since he need to get back to take care of Shannon (his dog) and do homework, but he still came to see me. Joe even had to go to my biology class at 6 with me since my professor made a big point out of attending class this week. Haha...that's when you know someone sincerely likes you.

When Joe and I are together, we really don't even do much of anything. We don't have to stay busy or go out someplace to keep ourselves occupied.

Despite Joe and I only dating for a week, I feel really good about our relationship. I'm finding that some things that would normally get to me don't even matter anymore. I'm different when I'm around Joe and its a good thing. He makes me calm and at peace.

--

On the other side of the fence, Billy followed me to my car yesterday. That was annoying at hell. I had his phone turned off b/c I wasn't about to pay for it yet another month. Sam started bitching at me after I told Billy I was ready to just be done with it all (and that I didn't give a damn whether or not he had a working phone). She is basically stealing a movie I let her borrow because of it. How immature is that? Its not my fault that I gave Sam a week to get Billy's line transfered over to her account and she sat on her ass and did nothing. Oh well, some people never grow up...

I'm definitely better off the way things turned out. I can't be too mad at Billy for being such a cheating douchebag since I ended up with someone as amazing as Joe. :)

"event","Being back home has been a lot better than I had originally expected.  Usually I don't like being home, but its been so peaceful and actually relaxing so far.

I think part of it is because Billy has been driving me crazy at school.  Don't get me wrong, he's a good guy, but I can only take so much of any one person before I want to run away screaming.  Billy likes to spend almost every waking second together and I just can't really take it.  And now that I am home, he has asked me to call him almost every single day.  Its not really that big of a deal I guess, but when do I get my break if I still have to talk to him everyday for a couple of hours?  Our relationship shouldn't feel like a job I don't want to go to in the morning.

On top of talking to Billy on the phone everyday, he begged me to go see him for Christmas.  I don't celebrate Christmas nor do I intend to start.  I reluctantly went and told him that he wouldn't get me to celebrate holidays I don't believe in.  Anyways, I got my car stuck in his yard because of his driveway's new gravel and the fact it has rained several days in a row.

Bridgette and I have been getting along pretty well since I've been back.  So yay.  I've been going with her to drop off/pick up the kid.  That's not too exciting, but oh well.

Plus, I've seen some good friends since being home.  Sawyer and I hung out before Christmas.  I hung out with LeAnn last night, and I also saw Candace and Matt in Wal-Mart.  :)

I walked into the living room after coming back from spending two days with Constance and Jake.  As I entered the room from the kitchen, I just glanced around and something caught my eye.  There was a blue light coming from the night light I had picked up when Cody and I ripped up the carpet and stuck in the dead outlet behind where the couch used to be.  I simply placed the night light there to get it out of the way for the time being.

My first reaction to seeing the night light on in a previously dead outlet was the immediate outburst of, ""Hey!  Wait!""  :P  I then turned around, proceded to call Bridgette's name (she was at the sink in the kitchen) and before I could even ask, she told me that Daddy had the electricity fixed today.  Imagine that.  :D

No more cords going across the floor of my room!  Woot!  Well, except for the power cord to my laptop when its sitting on the table and the RJ-45 cable running to my XBOX 360 from the router in Bridgette's room.  :)

Last week I got sunburned pretty bad at the lake.  I had decided to buzz my hair myself a couple of days before.  Surprisingly enough, I actually did a pretty good job on my hair.  Since I was at the lake for 4 hours, my face and the top of my head got fried.  According to David it looked like I had a skin disease.  Thankfully that only lasted until Saturday.

I was swimming with Leann and Jake and Cody and his cousins joined us later.  After that was over with, Jake, Cody, Leann and I went to see Wall-E.  It was an alright movie I guess.

The peeling of my forehead and scalp kept me from going out in public.  I did, however, go see David on the 4th.  He was home alone and I wasn't really doing anything.  Actually, that's sort of a lie.  Bridgette and I (and by that I mean me) set off a few fireworks.  Thankfully the big ones survived getting wet.

Last night was a bachelor's party of sorts for Justin (Constance's fiance).  Me, Matt, Cody, Curtis, MD, Jacob, Jacob's neighbor, and a couple of other people all partied.  Justin and Constance didn't stay very long though.  Technically speaking, Constance left and came back due to a party foul of Justin's.  Anyways, everyone but this one girl got completely wasted.  It was good.  :)

Today was Constance's and Justin's wedding.  I was Constance's Best Man.  :P  I refuse to be called a ""Maid of Honor"".  I was told that I was a little over dressed for a courthouse wedding, but oh well.  At least everything worked out and they are happy.  That's all that really matter's right?

Today also would have been my one year anniversary.

When I got home it was a couple of hours after when Bridgette normally gets home but her car wasn't here.  That confused me for a little bit, especially when I discovered that Bridgette was home.  Well, Charles drove Daddy to the hospital in Bridgette's car.  Apparently Daddy wrecked his truck on the way to the doctor.  Then, later, he collapsed on Joann's porch and started coughing up blood.

The hospital is keeping him overnight.

For a few reasons I decided today was as good a day as any to start wearing my wedding band again.  I mean, why not, right?

Sometime recently I decided to go ahead and cut Joe from my life.  He has been nothing but a negative influence since I graduated high school.  And for someone that was supposed to be my friend he seemed to always try to say or do what he could to hurt me.  At least I don't have to worry about it anymore.

I love how sometimes I take what people say the wrong way.  But at least I didn't make an ass of myself, I think.  I did come to what was probably the wrong conclusion, but I at least decided to just leave it alone.  And I'm glad I caught the fact that I could be wrong.  Now I'm just even more confused.

It sucks when are out with great friends partying it up and your mind gets fixated on something else...

I should be at the party that MD is throwing for Constance and Justin...

Because of how fucked up my sleep schedule has become, my days tend to blend together and I forget what part of the week it is.

Sometime after I got back from Berea (Sunday night I believe) I ended up going to hang out with Matt P.  I hit a deer on the way to his house.  How fucking lame is that?  It ran out of nowhere and I ended up busting my passenger side headlight again as well as killing the turn signal.  :(

Monday night I went back to Matt's house to go swimming and keep him company until 8 AM.  He needed to do laundry b/c his lady friend was supposed to come see him.  Anyways, we ended up goign to a crappy laundry mat at about 7.  Matt pointed out that if he was gay we would make the perfect gay couple.  lol  If only.  ;)

Anyways, Matt and I had breakfast at McDonald's and we then went back to his house to crash.  I slept for a couple of hours before heading back home.  Once back home, Constance got hold of me to see if I wanted to go swimming with her.  I did, so we went.

Constance and I swam for a couple of hours before we had to pick up her brother.  We then got ice cream and eventually headed back to the lake.  We started to leave at about 6, but I didn't make it.  Cody ran into me and I decided to stay and hang out with him and his cousins.

Cody decided he was going to get a ride back home with me.  I took him home so he could shower and change clothes and then we headed over to my house.  Cody and I played video games and watched some Family Guy before going to bed.  We also smoked a little.  It was fun.  :)

The next day, Cody and I had to get ready to go shopping with Bridgette.  Cody wasn't originally going to go with us, but I decided to let Bridgette take him home when we left and she went the opposite way of Cody's house to town...so he came with us.  :P  The shopping sucked.  And the entire time we were out, Jake kept calling me trying to get hold of Cody.  I eventually got tired of it when Jake mentioned something about coming to my house to pick up Cody.

I got a little annoyed that Jake kept fucking calling me to get hold of Cody.  I had tried to call Jake a few times in the past week and Jake never answered or returned my call.  So what the fuck?  Anyways, Jake ended up getting online and got hold of Cody.  Jake was coming to pick him up after that.  Whatever.  That pissed me off.  Jake couldn't fucking call me to hang out with me.  No.  He had to call me constantly <b>after</b> he found out I was with Cody and bitch about being bored and then come steal who I was hanging out with.  Well, I'm glad he fucking got what he wanted.  I wouldn't be so pissed if the situation wasn't just so completely stupid.  Its like Jake was fucking jealous and had to compete with me.  Stupid queer drama.

Gay boys in gereral are just fucking drama magnets.  Matt T. started talking to me again and tonight decided to go off on me for no fucking reason.  He claimed he's stressed.  Well, that's no fucking excuse to invent a reason to get pissed off at me.  Yeah, the youngest Matt I know (Matt P.) is the most mature one...lol

Well, there were already a few people at Matt's place by the time I got there, but Matt, this girl Lindsey, and myself went swimming anyways.  And I have to say, it was pretty fucking fun.  Though the water was a little odd since it was a little warm on my feet, close to being hot on my hands, yet cold on my back and stomach.  Also, who would have guessed that the yellow floaty thing (I don't know what its called) would be so much fun to play with?  :P

I stayed at the lake longer than I hoped for b/c I simply lost track of time.  We left roughly around 3:30 and I headed over to Johnathan's.  He said in the voicemail that he left that he would be home.  It was 4 am exactly when I got to his appartment.  Normally he would have been awake since it was 3 am for him and he works night shift, but he didn't seem to be tonight.

I knocked twice before going to get gas, driving down the road a bit and deciding to just walk in and wake him up, and then going back to discover the door was locked and my next attempt at knocking did nothing.  So before leaving I wrote up a stupid little note to just let Johnathan know that I stopped by.

On the way back home, I was really disappointed.  I hadn't exactly heard from Johnathan in something like 3 weeks so I was really hoping to get to see him.  That's just my luck.  :(  Now I'm a little depressed.

Could it be possible if we fly into the fire <i>together</i> it can't burn us both?  Its true that it takes more energy to burn a larger amount of mass.  So yes, its possible that the fire doesn't have what it takes to burn us both if we stop trying to go in alone.

So why do we keep working on our own and never getting anywhere?  Is it pride?  Or are we afraid to trust the other moth to keep his resolve and go in together as one?

Every moment we waste dancing around the flame is another possibility we have lost.  And when the fire is gone, we won't have another chance to see what could have been.  All we really need is a little faith that the fire isn't as hot as it seems.

I dont remember the exact days, but I went to Jake's to hang out with Constance and Jake, and their friend, Cody, was there.  We all just chilled before going back to Constance's.  Constance fell asleep so Jake, Cody, and I walked back to Jake's house.  It was a good two hour walk, but it was so much fun.  :)  Another day I just hung out with Jake in town and then went back to his house to watch a movie.  It was fun too.

Last night, I met up with Constance and her friend, Brittany, at the Kroger across town.  We basically spent the night in the parking lot and then at the lake.  The lake was so damn pretty.  I saw a few shooting stars and I made some wishes.  Yeah, I know they won't come true b/c I always wish for the same thing and it never happens...but oh well.  Brittany and her friend, Matt, left me and Constance at the lake.  Constance and I had fun though.  She made the comment that we have too much fun together, and it is true.  After a quick trip to Wal-Mart, Constance and I went back to her house and played some Rummy.  It was fun...and I definitely won.  :P

Today could have went a lot better.  Joe told me he was coming down for some family stuff, but that he also wanted to hang out with me.  Well, I hadn't heard much from him when Jake called me.  He wanted to hang out after he got off work.  Well, Jake and I went to the lake and did some swimming.  The water was fucking cold, but it was ok.  After the swimming, Jake and I skipped some rocks for a while.  It was fun.

I got hungry, so Jake and I went to Taco Bell.  Normally I don't like Taco Bell, but I really wanted a burrito.  :)  We ended up hanging out in the parking lot for a while, which makes me wonder, ""Why do I spend a lot of time in parking lots?""

Anyways, Joe finally got hold of me and decided to hang out.  I have to say I'm really disappointed by how it turned out.  Sure, we had fun and it was good to see him, but he left pretty early.  I wanted him to come back to my house and stay the night so we could talk and hang out some more, but he was set on going back to Louisville tonight.  It really sucks that I haven't seen him in months and the one time I can realistically spend some time with him, he decides he want to leave.

*sigh*  Joe depresses me sometimes.  I'd really like to have the kind of friendship we used to have, but he seems to be too worried about fucking it up that to enjoy what we could have.  Its actually having the opposite effect and making us be distant since we never see each other and don't exactly talk that much anyways.

Tuesday was nothing special, but Friday Johnthan, David, and I went to Russel Springs to see the new Chronicles of Narnia movie.  It wasn't as good as the first one, but I can't complain since David paid for it.  :P

I was depressed before I even got to Johnathan's and it didn't get better after the movie.  I felt like I was imposing by not leaving after we got back, so I decided to leave.  I wanted to cry before I even drove off.  I'm not sure why, but I think it has something to do with Chris.  Anyways, before I got too far outside of Columbia I turned around and headed back.  Isolating myself whenever I am feeling down and awkward never helps anything so I figured I would shake things up and force myself to be social.  It worked out.  Me, Johnathan, and David all three fell asleep in the living room watching Fat Albert (the movie).

Saturday, I had plans to see Drew.  I also needed to get my hair cut.  Luckily I managed to get my hair cut mission accomplished before leaving for Drew's.  Once at Drew's house, he and I just watched TV the entire time I was there.  Uhm...I wish some things would have happened differently (or not at all) but I can't really complain.  It was good seeing him.

Sadly enough, Bridgette and I went back to Harrodsburg today so I could fix my phone.  I had just gotten my new one fixed so I would recieve calls while down here and I messed it up by switching back to my enV online.  My goal was to fix the IM crashing issue it has by installing the new version, but once I switched phones the data access was cut on both of them until I could get them to a service area to do a reprogramming.  I didn't get to fix the enV though because I had switched back to the Glyde online and the website wouldn't let me switch back once I got to Harrodsburg (the site was down then).

Originally, I wanted to go see Chris this weekend.  Of course that didn't work out.  Big surprise there, right?  I never even got offical word from him of whether or not I could stay with him for a few weeks.  Seriously.  Who offers you a place a stay and then almost avoids talking about when you want to take them up on the offer?  I even told him that I at least wanted to visit this weekend and I never got anything back from him.  Go figure.  Chris is so fucking unrealiable most of the time its ridiculous.  I swear...if I confront him about it and he tells me I should have just showed up if I wanted to see him I will drive to his fucking house and punch him in the face.  That is not how things work.

That last bit about Chris actually leads me into a rant.  Since when to people fucking expect you to be rude?  Actually, since when do people get offended when you are <b>not</b> rude?  Once at Summer's appartment this week I asked to use her bathroom.  She looked at me like I had just kicked her dog across the room and asked, ""Why the fuck did you just ask me that?""  She then told me to just go ahead and use it whenever I was at her appartment and never ask for anything.  Chris had a similar reaction whenever I asked to use the bathroom the first time I visited his house.  But Chris takes it a little further than that.  It sort of pissed me off whenever he would tell me that if I wanted to do something I should have just done it instead of asking and waiting for the ok.  Well, like I previous said, things don't work that way...its not always about me.  Trust me, if it was things would be a lot different.  So why the fuck would someone want me to be rude, have a great chance of showing up at a bad time, and quite possibly waste my time and energy when all he would have to do is return a text message or phone call?  I can't really tell if he just really expects me to be that rude or if he uses than an easy way out of ignoring me whenever I mention I want to see him.

Actually, why haven't I just said, ""Fuck it!"" to talking to and seeing Chris?  It beats me...

"event","Thursday night I had plans to go out with Matt to a bar.  It was supposed to be just me and him, but his roommate went to (I'm not complaining).  We went to Tbombs and everything went well for the first part of the night.

After a few shots, things went down hill.  I was acting no differently than I had around Matt the other times we hung out, but he apparently was in a mood that night.  Matt started punching me in the leg (I have a bad bruise there) to get me to stop with the horseplay.  Well, it was pissing me off so of course I didn't stop.  Then he made his mistake...he blew smoke in my face.  I told him not to do it again.  He said he would.  I then let him know that I would leave if he did do it again.  He told me a second time that he would do it again and then said that I would not leave.  I then left.

Once I was back at my dorm, I got that thinking that it was pretty immature of me to leave just to prove a point.  I then let Matt know that I would come back to his house.  I wanted to just forget it happened so we would be cool.  He didn't share my desire though.

I was told not to come back after I was already over half way to his house.  Since I wasn't ""allowed"" back in his house, I decided I was going to sleep in my car.  When I got inside my car, Matt came out of his house and tried to ""convince"" me to come out so we could fight.  He actually wanted to have a fist fight with me b/c <i>I</i> had pissed him off by leaving.  I mean, WTF?!

Anyways, I was drunk so I ignored Matt and went to sleep.  I woke up sometime after 5.  I got about 5 hours of sleep considering I got to my car a litle after 12 and feel asleep pretty quickly.  Upon the realization that my car was blocked in intentionally (there was not even an inch between the bumpers of my car and the cars blocking me in).  I called Matt and asked him to move one of the cars so I could leave.  He refused.  He also hung up on me, which just made things worse.  I tried to call him back and I eventually left a voicemail telling him that if he didn't move one of the cars, I would move them both for him.  Matt let me know that he was awake and watching me out the window by turning the porch light off and just standing at the window in the living room.

The real fun happened next.  I started up my car, put it in reverse, and floored it.  I didn't exactly move much, but I pushed the car behind me a little bit.  I then put the car in drive and floored it again.  That moved the car in front of me a little.  I switched back and forth a few times and then I got lucky.  My car popped out from between the two and, b/c I was flooring it, I went spinning through Matt's yard.  In my path was something I ran over (I think it was a light) which caused my front left tire to blow out.  Luckily for me I had a spare, but I didn't change the tire until got back to school.

It was a pain in the ass to change a tire a little before 6 in the morning.  But I got it done, so I guess it could have been worse.  Matt then spent the rest of the day trying to convince me he talked to the police about my ""hit and run"".  Whatever.  He was holding my car hostage and he totally knows the police wouldn't look to highly on that to begin with.  I should have just called the cops though and had them make him let me leave.  Then I would be able to open my passenger side door and I wouldn't have a busted turn signal or a blown tire.

Around noon I was supposed to have lunch with Chris, but I didn't get there in time because I was also going to return my Voyager to the Verizon Store in the same trip (to save a lot of gas) and the data cable was in bag which just happened to be in Tonya's dorm room.  Tonya didn't get around to getting my bag to me until right when I needed to be in Lexington.  Yeah..that was nice.

--

One would think that I would unpack before running around other places.  Well, that didn't happen.  I dropped off a load of laundry and my clean clothes and then over to Johnathan's.

During my stay at his appartment, a small party happened.  It was me, Johnathan, David, Kelly, Summer, another Johnathan, an Eric, and a Jason.  Eric and the other Johnathan hooked up and went for a ""drive"".  They totally had sex, but oh well (there was evidence...enough said).  

Everything was good and fun until Eric and other Johnathan got back.  They were definitely too lound and just too...stupid.  Well, Eric wasn't bad.  He just doesn't know when to stop drinking and we have to hide the alcohol from him after a certain point.  But other Johnathan...geez!  I'm surprised he didn't get punched in the face before the night was over with.  He was pissing off Johnathan, he pissed off David, and he was annoying the hell out of me.  Right before he left, Johnna, Johnathan's roommate, came down from her room and started hanging with us.  She almost got into with other Johnathan.  When he was walking out the door it was pretty obvious she wanted to just bitch slap him but she didn't.  It probably would have been a good thing if she did.  Oh well.

After all the excitement of my weekend, I eventually get back home and settled back in.  And I had a new phone to play with, the Samsung Glyde, as well as new pets...I started raising a batch of triops that Bridgette had had in her closet for several months.

--

I got a call from UPS in Lexington yesterday.  I applied there before I decided I had to come back home.  Since Chris had told me I could stay with him for a while, I asked him if it would still be ok if I did.  We talked about it for a little while, but I never got a definite answer...he just seemed to be ok with it, but I need more than that.

The more I thought about going back to the Lexington area though, the more I realized that I <i>need</i> to stay home.  Bridgette is the only real family I have, so I should stay close while I can.  And my friends in Columbia (Johnathan, David, Kelly, and Summer) are amazing so I shouldn't be so ready to leave.  No, I'm not letting other people make the decision to stay for me.  I feel like it will do me some good to be around my family and friends that I don't see that often when at school.

As much as I would love to ""come home"" to Chris everyday, even if it was just for a few weeks, it wouldn't mean anything unless we were <i>together</i>.  I would be putting myself into a tricky situation where I'm loving the outcome but the means would be misleading.

Hopefully I will get to visit Chris sometime soon so we can just hang out and have some fun.  I really miss that boy and I wish I would have gotten to see him before coming home.

"event","Tyler eventually showed up Monday night to go to Mia's with me.  It was late in the night though, but it worked out.  We picked up his friend, Haley and then were on our way.

Thankfully I only saw two people I know.  I saw this guy named Dave that I met at the Complex and I convinced Will to come see me.  It was fun, despite how Tyler was off scoring free drinks from other guys.  And after he asked me if I would buy his drinks for him.  So lame.  And he got mad at me for hanging with Dave too.  Whatever.  Tyler even called Jason to complain about Dave...lol

When we got back to my room, Tyler started talking to Chase about being drunk.  It was funny, but also sad.  Shortly after we got settled, we both passed out.  Tyler had to be up at 7 the next morning, and that wasn't fun because I was still hung over.

Tuesday night I went to see Iron Man with Shaun.  It was a fun time until he started getting bitchy with me.  Oh well.  I just left after I went to hung him and he bitched at me for touching his stomach because the food at the Movie Tavern upset it.

Once back in Richmond, I went to Matt's to drink with him and Josh.  It turns out that he lied to me when I asked who was there.  I'm not really too mad b/c it was only his gf, Roxanne, and a couple of his friends and his roommate, plus Josh.  He said he really wanted me there b/c he had a bad day and he wanted his friends there.  Once I had a few drinks down, I was ok.  :P  Plus, me and one of Matt's friends had some stuff in common so we talked some.

My back was killing me though Wednesday morning because I passed out on Matt's couch.  I didn't even have time to sober up completely when I went to take my Antrhopology final.  I was seriously still a little drunk when I went to it, which was sad.  But I did good on it, so it was ok.

Last night I went to see Dave and we watched The Devil Wears Prada.  Plus, he gave me a kick-ass back massage.  :P

After a random, spur of the moment, from the heart text message I sent to Chris, we started talking a little bit and it turns out I made him smile.  I mean, that's a step in the right direction, right?  We're going to have lunch tomorrow after I pick up my new, shiny Samsung Glyde from the Verizon store.

"event","Thursday night, Melissa and I decided we were going to walk downtown to a bar.  Once we found a good one, we sat down at the bar for a drink.  Of all the people to come walking into the bar, Josh H. walked in and saw us right away.  He was with his friend Matt.

After a little while, Josh and Matt hung out with me and Melissa and Matt spent the night buying us all shots.  Neither me or Melissa remembers the exact number of shots that Matt baught us, but it was at least 10.  They were yummy too.  :)  I got so wasted but had so much fun!  Not to mention that Matt is really cute.  ;)

Friday I went to Berea to hang out with Jason.  Before the night was over with, Tyler came up to hang out.  It was fun...and I got my wallet back!  Tyler mentioned that he wanted to go to Mia's tonight so he could make-out with me and not be stared at.  He should be here later tonight so we can go out.  We kissed a little before we both left the Berea Hospital parking lot.  What can I say, I'm a make-out whore.

Saturday afternoon, I came back to my room after making another trip to Berea to find that Chase had moved my TV, Wii, and Xbox 360.  Granted my TV was on top of his microwave and the consoles sitting next to it, he could have easily asked me to move them before I left.  Or called me to see if it was ok if he moved them.  Or even waited until I got back.  I mean, was it really urgent that he remove the microwave?  I don't think it was.  And the asshole knows I don't like it when he or his whore touch my stuff (that comes from the time the bitch moved my Wii so she could sit her fucking flat iron on MY dresser).  Anyways, I was pissed.  I moved his TV off of the fridge, which is on my dresser, and put my TV on it.  I then packed up most of my valuale stuff b/c I don't trust him in the room anymore.  I then called and bitched him out for moving my stuff and told him his TV was not going back on my dresser.

That night, Matt convinced me to go out to the bar complex in Lexington.  We went with Josh and Matt's friend, Russel.  It was pretty fucking amazing!  Matt baught all of my drinks for me (he's great!) and I ran into a few people that I know.  Chris's friend, Dustin, was there and I ran into my friend Jeremy.  It was great seeing Jeremy.  :)  While I was hanging out with this one guy that I didn't know (he knew everyone I was with it seems), Jeremy decided he wanted to go back to Matt's house with us.  It was ok with everyone so he did.

Jeremy ended up talking to Russel a lot while Matt, Josh, and I wrestled around.  I got a huge bite mark on my shoulder from Matt, as well as a bruise on my collar bone...not to mention the rub burn on my arm and the numerous other sore spots caused from hitting the floor and walls.  I tried to join in the convo between Jeremy and Russel to only start a one-on-one convo about politics with Russel.  Shortly thereafter Jeremy passed out.  I then spent the night goofing off with Matt.  He ripped my underwear at one point while trying to give me a wedgie.  We faught a little b/c of it, but he appologized b/c he didn't want to ruin a friendship.  That was really sweet of him.  He's such a good guy!

Josh woke Matt and I up around 7 or so in the morning.  We had passed out on floor.  After I was woken up, I was cold so I couldn't go back to sleep.  I decided to get Jeremy up and take him back to my room so we could take a nap before I took him back home.  We slept until close to 1.

When I got back from taking Jeremy home, I went back to Matt's to watch Cloverfield with him and Josh.  All three of us were all cuddled up on the couch...lol  It was interesting.  And I almost got chained to a tree.

Anyways, once I got back to my room, Chase had come back with his whore and moved his dresser out so he had something to sit his TV on.  And his dresser conveniently blocked access to my side of the room.  I tried playing Assassin's Creed b/c I had nothing else to do, and Chase decided he was going to be an asshole and turn his TV up way too fucking loud!  I mean, quiet hours started over the weekend since it's finals week.  I needed to be able to hear my game to know whether or not a guard saw me or the like, yet I couldn't b/c he was blasting his fucking TV presumable just to piss me off.  Well, I have a surprise for him later.  ;)

Tyler was supposed to come over last night, but he didn't b/c he was too tired.  Like I said earlier though, he should be over here tonight at least.  I can't wait to go back out, especially with Tyler.

Richmond has really become a place I want to be.  Melissa is going to be here over the summer.  Jason is going to be in Berea.  Matt and Josh are both going to be.  And I have friends in Lexington too.  I've so much fun in this past month it's absurd.  It really makes me want to stay, but I can't b/c I don't have to place to live.  Chris has showed his bad side and has been ignoring me (immediately after offering a place a stay with him) and Matt said I could stay with him if he didn't already have 4 people staying there.  *sigh*  If only I could find a place to stay and find a decent job up here...

And my friend, Eric, is awesome too.  :)  We went to the waterfall tonight and then I went over to his apartment a little bit later and watched part of a good movie.

I'm really tempted to tell Chris something.  I know I shouldn't be afraid to speak my mind, but I just am.  Letting him know something that I already do shouldn't hurt anything, right?

In other news, I had a pretty amazing dream though.  :P  I moved into a new room with an amazing roommate.  And the room was across the hall, but didn't look like it belonged in this dorm b/c it was so much nicer.  Yes, my roommate gets on my nerves that much that I'm dreaming about living with a good roommate.

Yay...I'm glad I'm living in Clay next year with a new roommate!

"event","I decided to not go to my classes today since I woke up sort of late and needed to shave.  I know that's a horrible reason to not go to class, but whatever...I just didn't want to go.

Today was Tonya's birthday and I was invited to have dinner at Olive Garden with her and Josh (another girl showed up as well).  I actually beat them there, which was so strange!  I about suffocated before I even left my room.  No one needs to spray that much hairspray and perfume...really.  Eh, it could have been worse though.

Dinner was so amazing!  Yum!  We each got a class drink, but Tonya didn't really drink hers.  :(  Oh well.  Josh also got the waiters to sing her their birthday song.  The girls managed to emabarrass themselves a few times, especially Josh's friend.  She mentioned something about everyone liking boobs right as a waiter braught our drinks.  He admitted to liking boobs too...lol  Fun times.  I'm really glad I went with them.  I had a lot of fun.  It's to have a little bit of hope that I'm keeping my friend.

After that 5 page paper I did today I'm almost caught up in school now.  Yay!  But I still have outdoor labs to do.  And hopefully I'll end up going with Cam to do them.

Its fucking hot in my room!  I wish they would turn on the fucking air already.  I seriously can't stand being under the cover with it being this hot.

And how many times does trying to contact someone have to go unanswered before they are ignoring you?  At any rate, I'm sure I've reached that limit.  It sucks not being over someone that seems to ignore you.  Ugh...I'm just afraid when (and if) I get to the point that I'm over Chris that I'm actually going to not want to even be his friend.  He's a great guy, but if he's being elusive on purpose so that I will move on so we can be friends instead, I'm afraid its really just hurting me more and making me bitter towards him.  I would say I'm overreacting, but I guess I would have to care a little bit more instead of being so apathetic and and just making an easy assumption to make...

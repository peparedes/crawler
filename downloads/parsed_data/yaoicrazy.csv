"event","I am so tired right now i can't think straight...this creepy guy who is 40 is trying to flirt with me and i was flirting with him before but i didn't know he was forty then...i went to six flags on thursday and it was only for a few hours. i got my face half painted and went on some rides. i invented mario to come and he was touching and i was trying to send him back off signals which i don't think he got. me and genoa went job hunting and i got a few applications but i don't think they will hire me. i have been playing my DS for the past two days: Summon Night Twin Age and Lux-Pain. they are cool rpg games but still a little lame with reptiveness. i hope something exciting happens to keep me awake though them. christina changed her password to her laptop so i can only hack into now if i want the internet...i am bored, tired, horny- the usual three. i hope jack can hang this weekend so i can get rid of one of the three ;D
Peace Out!"

"event","so yesterday i finally ended things with james. really. i am done. i am now single and loving having fun with random guys. i am not looking for anything serious but if the right guy comes, i will consider it. i am actually considering things with jack.

i hung with kathy on sunday and we were at the park with peter, tiff, and marlissa. it was fun just hanging and being idoits and influencing the kids. omg. so i said masturbate too loud in front of a mom >< XD
then genoa came and we hung at peter's and me, kathy, and genoa stayed the longest and tiff was bad at that but we were all w/e
then the next day me and peter were being nerds by texting pokemon moves to each other :P

now i am hanging with ryan and robert and nat. nat was raping me by tickling and such and ryan joined in. we were looking at ryan's porn before nat left. now we are being nerds with DS's and laptops with free interwebs"

"event","summer thus far- fisrt day i called everyone and they were busy so i went to the libray and used my sis's cam to cam with ken an online friend who lives in Denver.

then i almost burned down maddie's house on sunday. we ate the brownie meant for dom's party and then we tryed to make a cookie cake but we placed it on a flat baking sheet instead of a round one and so it spilled over. sky thought it was a good idea to put the oven on self cleaner and we took a walk aand maddie worried about tleaving the oven on like that alone so we went back to a house full of smoke and a oven with a small fire. maddie couldn't find the extinsher so she used water which isn't for baking fires- baking soda, flour, etc is meant for that.

dom's going away party was fun but sad since he's left on wednesday for army training and he's one of the nicest guys ever! pictures later but i don't think any of you know dom dom

tuesday james snuck over and then my dad came home early and now i am getting the awkardness from my rents instead of being grounded. we broke christina's candle holder in the bathtub cause the flame heated up the glass ><

wednesday i played the 84 song set list on rock band 2 at maddie's. tis fun. we wrestled with emmie and james and now my arms are sore. i won against maddie only qq

thursday was slow. i hung with moira and we mainly hanged out on the interwebs and watched funny ass movies and she slready posted the mad libs which is on my myspace. then i texted a bunch of peeps and watch tv when i got home. talked to mario mostly and then talked to him on the phone. we were so flirting and i didn't mind. james told how he finds me ""freaking hot"" and he is a little creepy but overall nice. maybe i will pursue him.

early this mornign i was trying to get pics from my mac to sis's laptop but my mac won't turn on qq HELP!
then i checked to see if there were any networks for wifi and the one from moira's was still there so i've been on the internet since like 4am?? XD and i offically webcamed with ken ;) it was fun and nervous and awkard but i liked it hehehe me is naughty

going to robert's b-day party later today...YAY!!!!!"

"event","Prom was teh sex! i got my dress from macy's and got my hair done at got 2 be cut and my nails by a friend of my parents who does it on the side- maryann.
i went to maddie's house for pictures and sean gave me and her crossages that match our dresses and he had his own boutner even though we got him one but apparently maddie got a pink one that only match her dress and sean's matched both of ours.
went to west's for the limo: west, richelle, stephen germann, kritnia, tyler, lisa, maddie, sean, and me
the ride was awesome. me and maddie flashed our garders and sean looked away ^^ so cute
the food sucked. maddie was the pickest. the lady gave her pasta since she is a vegaterian but she hates red sauce and she wouldn't even touch the salad and only ate the chocolate sauce of the cake >< we flipped our table number ftom 66 to 99 and we confused one person :D then we dance all night i danced to songs i hated even :O the ride to ihop was dead. i felled alseep on sean. i had the kid's face panckae and was being way too open and pervy and happy hands on maddie like i usually am when i'm tired. the ride back to west's i fell alseep with maddie on sean and he took a pic and we continue sleeping to sean's house and then me and maddie slept on each other.
check out prom pictures on my myspace under tagged photos. i will try to get them on my facebook and maybe lj soon."

saturday i was a picture hoe with ichigo from tokyo mew mew and i got my first creeper. a guy took pics of me with a fancy camara said thank you and left and he had me pose and didn't say anything about a website. i helped two groups with the otku quest.

"event","So I chose the sims picture to show that i have to update on if that makes any sense. i read my old posts and they were from 8th grade and i have no fucking clue who the guy was that i liked but wouldn't tell.

8th grade- i kissed jessie seul in feb. and i did not like it. i didn't tell till the last fna and i fell shitty about it. the 8th grade dance was fun and i was upset i didn't dance with jack. i saw james and found out later that he wanted to slow dance with me qq

Freshman year- ummmm...shit...i transfer into james' history class cause i switched math classes. i got a crush on him again but found out at the homecoming dance (sister was my date hehe i got to go though the almond side) he liked/was going out with christine. i contiuned cybering with jack and gave him my number which i found out later that he gave me his but right when i signed out so i didn't know till it was too late. then he fell in love with WoW too much and iqroned me and right around this time i started to wear a pink cat collar and james broke up with christine and we started to flirt with each other though naughty notes. at turnabout i went with him and wanted to hold his hand and found out later he did too but then justin crow gave me a crossage for some reason and it broke when i was dancing and christina was all ""it's a sign"" a month later james asked me out on march 2nd though a note. that same day i broke off the cybering with jack and found out he liked me and stupid me didn't think of dating more than one person >< so me and james were a happy couple since it was the beginnig. my mom found out about us at the fishfry when his mom said we were snuggling outside and so we could only hang in each other houses so me and james had lots of alone time in the bedroom since we couldn't go out on dates. stupid mom. i <3 my lunch period that year and lost some yaoi too including lost boys since i don't even remember that one...:( band had lots of card games. never play egytian war or cups with alex paul- he is vicous. i started colorguard. show guard was Shrek with hooker lime green tops (pics later) and jv guard was Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend where we had long lime green tops.

Softmore summer- i missed james for two weeks at his ymca camp and we hung out a lot. i had band camp where i stuck ice cubes down my sports bra. show guard was james bond with skin tight jumpsuit and pink leotard.

Softmore year- me and james were happy until that day with the note that i thought he was breaking up with me and i had to go to the dean's for my skirt and tryed not to cry and then i did and so i went to the nurse and found out later that he needed time to think about why he was so angry that's all. i had phone sex with jack and we broke up for a day and then he gave me another chance. guard was the best since we started to go this other competion where it's all guard and the freshies didn't annoy me yet. the theme was lion king with brown and black dresses and wild hair :P

Junior Summer- I lost my virgnity to james sometime in june and missed him for three weeks at camp. show theme was a mixture of this one guy's music (star wars, etc) we had this awesome black outfit. worst captains ever since no one knew how to roll a flag and such (i'll ramble later about guard)

Junior year- me and james are fighting a lot. i start to hit him playfully and sometimes not for some reason. he broke up with me on march 22nd because kristine seem like a better girl plus lots of other reasons that been constant with our relantionship. this is the point also where he really hates jack and can't see how i can still be friends with him after what happened on the phone. everything else i will ramble later about.

Peace and thanks for catching up with me ^_^
If i missed something please let me know."

OH! and that love chain letter is soooo sweeet! i'll post it here!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Why do boys fall in love with girls?
(This was written by a guy)

Don't break this; it's so sweet! :)

1. They will always smell good even if it's just shampoo.
2. The way their heads always find the right spot on our shoulder.
3. How cute they look when they sleep.
4. The ease in which they fit into our arms .
5. The way they kiss you and all of a sudden everything is right in the world.
6. How cute they are when they eat.
7. The way they take hours to get dressed but in the end it makes it all worth while.
8. Because they are always warm even when its minus 30 outside.
9. The way they look good no matter what they wear.
10. The way they fish for compliments even though you both know that you think she's the most beautiful girl on this earth.
11. How cute they are when they argue.
12. T he way her hand always finds yours.
13. The way they smile.
14. The way you feel when you see their name on the call ID after you just had a big fight.
15. The way she says ""lets not fight anymore"" even though you know that an hour later....
16. The way that they kiss after you have had a fight.
17. The way they kiss you when you say ""I love you"".
18. Actually...Just the way they kiss you...
19. The way they fall into your arms when they cry.
20. Then the way they apologize for crying over something that silly.
21. The way they hit you and expect it to hurt.
22. Then the way they apologize when it does hurt (even though we don't admit it).
23. The way they say ""I miss you"".
24. The way you miss them.
25. The way their tears make you want to change the world so that it doesn't hurt her anymore...

Yet regardless if you love them, hate them, wish they would die or know that you would die without them it matters not. Because once in your li fe, whatever they were to the world they become everything to you. When you look them in the eyes, traveling to the depths of their souls and you say a million things without trace of a sound, you know that your own life is inevitable consumed within the rhythmic beatings of her very heart. We love them for a million reasons, no paper would do it justice. It is a thing not of the mind but of the heart.
A feeling.
Only felt.

This chain started in 2002.

It is a love chain letter.

In an hour you are supposed to repost this.

Now here comes the fun part.

You then say the name of the person you like or love and then the person will say ""I love you,"" or ""Will you go out with me?"" NO JOKE!!!!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dont u think so too? *falls in love for no reason*

i want balls. 
they will make me hyper.
they equal 6-7 Mountian Dews. 
they go great w/ pizza.

"event","on fri. there was the pep rally and it was stupid. useless. that sums it up. 
on sat. we march in the parde and i had to be at some flagist house 5:30am tyo get hair and make-up done...because i didnt sleepover! alot of other girls didnt sleepover ether so i wasnt left out at least. we did gut at the parde and same w/ the football game. but it  was fucking freezey out and flags couldn't wear our nice, warm, cozy, jackets...fuck them. 

HOMECOMING DANCE!: it was pretty gut. they didnt play alot of rap, mainly techno YAY!. i went to Chili's before and was really LeaF like. and then Jermany (my sis's friend and also Adia's(another friend) boyfriend) put lots of sugar in his free tea. yes, free tea. Christne(anothe rfriend) bought tea because Jermany wanted some before and then he ask if he could get hot water and if it was free. ""yes..."" -waitress*she really had to deal w/ alot that night...feel worse for her then for steve* ""SWEET! fre tea."" he also said he wanted a dreess*actually tunic* like mine. and he was serious. my dress was a chinse type dress. it was pretty!
at the dance i hung w/ my sis and herfriends until Mel came over and i went w/ her. then i join james,chritne r., katie f., steven, tiffany- she also likes yaoi!!, and some other dude. mel, ktie, and stven left so it was just us 5 left. we dance. we rest. but the thing i hate the most was i didnt get to slow dance w/ James! christione got to 3 times! and whenver i see her i feel angry and jealous because i think they like each other...altough i do also like jack so...should i feel this way?

Jack Pros. 
-sexy
-perveted
-move to Japan
Jack Cons.
-feel self consoius when around him. ex.: have to be pretty, look nice, etc.
-doens't dance

James Pros.
-funny 
-nice
-anime
-dont feel self coniuos
-dances
James Cons.

"event","today was a off day for me. (but then again when isn't it?). 

first off, i went down to Alegbra 1 because geomatry was a little too hard for me. now i want to go back! we are doing the easy stuf and peolpe are STILL asking stupid questions...*sigh*. i hate my new math teacher too. she's not as nice and she writes in cursive on the chalkboard w/ yellow chalk. hello?! yellow blends into the green, use white! and now i aslo have history 2nd pr. instead of 7 becaus emy counsler said there was no more room in math classes during 2 pr. mr. gray saw me going to math class after activity and said that i hated his class and him and now he's losing his best student. i didn't like ALL that much but he was till cool. today i didnt have history at all since math was 7th and history is 2nd and i didnt change scudules till 5th pr. 

at lunch i was being really LeaF like. weird but i wasn't perverted(strange..). i forgot my lunch in my locker that i packed last night and then i bought lunch and then i remember i had lunch in my locker right when i started eating. 

after school i talked w/ Moira and i was being perverted LeaF. lucky u Moira u got me when i was perverted not weird...hehe...anyway that one guy that was there by the corner Moira hangs out at, the cool corner, i forgot his name, but i think i freak him out for life now...oh well!

*hums to Vagina- probaly spelled that wrong- song by Blood Hound Gang*

anywho, i know AguiraMC- i think that's her username- had already posted about the movie party, so i wont because she said all there is to it. *hugs her*. i htink we should post it on utube...I'LL MAKE A POLL!!!

the day before that i had a sleepover at my friend's kathy's house for her 14th birthday. she had a moonwalk and of course being teens we had to make up a game involing some sort of violence mix w/ stupidity. it was either moira or alli that invented this game. u ran from one corner of the moonwalk to the other and at the end after u hit the corner, u usally end in intersecting ways. thanks to this game i lost some brain cells(but who hasn't?) and i have a moonwalk burn on my hip. we had oreo pie from THE pie place. and then watch this german flim w/ three gay guys and it was base on star track. we played video games and me. moira, and alli were the only ones who stayed up and watched Monty Python and the flying circus. tis was a good night :)

let's see...school is school. my sis just told me my math teacher called, but for a bad reason :(...kevin...who cares, he doesn't know my name and plus no long hair :( :( so, i guess school is so lalala for me. 

yestarday i went to the renassiance faire w/ my sisters and mom. it wasn't as fun as last year though when my and christina went w/ carylon and her friends. the tomato guy was still there and he's the coolest thing there next to the shakesphere guy. the tomato dude makes insults at u while u throw tomatoes at him. the shakesphere guy interperts shakeshpere so u can UNDERSTAND it, in an awasome way. i wore my kimono, christina wore my taven girl dress, carylon wore a simple peasent outfit, and my mom was my mom. there was this one hot, and i mean anime-video game-not fat-not too skinny- HOT! he cosplayed as the blonde dude from Final Fansaty, me and my sis believe. i got to skip band pratcice! :) and i also got a new tote bag as some of u guys may have seen already. 

nothing happen today...i leave u with this ()
what does that look like to u?"

six flags: okay. me and kathy went to six flags and i actally went on more rollar coasters then the wizard! omg! then when i went w/ moria and kathy and patrick and jack and cyle and my mom*goans- i know but my parents want champs just in case we rape by some gang* anywho...jack at first said he would come then he couldnt then maybe and then BOOM! he was standing in line w/ some guy(cyle- we found out later) and yeah. we went on rides mainly separtely because the guys wanted to go on some rides we didnt want to go on and so we went on tamer rides like the teacups and fliggers' fling (although patrick got sick on there once and now it's the devil to him). we did go on rollar coasters together expect they went on acuople that we didnt want to go on. on the american egale i sat w/ moria and we were separted from the rest. appartly jack kept on saying penis the whole time...lol...then on the viper i went on w/ moria again expect this time jack and cyle were sitting behind us! (btw: kathy and patrick were stuck together on these two rides). on the iron wolf i sat w/ the guys because we could only go on together if two sat w/ this couple and one sat w/ the guys and for some reason (moria thinks it's because jack wanted me for my pervness) they wanted me. (lol). i sat inbetween patrick and cyle though...stupid jack! oh yeah! on the teacups us girls were talking about the guys(aka girl talk) and i mentain how were like on 'Friends'- 3 guys 3 girls. moria+patrick kathy+cyle me+jack. we talked/hanged. lots of perv moments...nuts, want some of my nuts? they're roasted to perfection! lol. i fell in love w/ jack and that's why i chose him over james even though james was winning by alot! 

summer school: on the first day i thaought some peolpe were nice - turns out they were jocks/preps. then on the second day i bought a manga in becasue i figured- no friends=manga time. then a girl named silver who bought one in on the first day, came up to me and started talking and we bacome perv friends! that's right! the pervs are gathering...so watch out...we are going to invade...WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER SOME PORN! which reminds me of this thing jack showed me*hehe- thing, showed* it was a WoW ""movie"" that was talking about how internet=pornpornporn

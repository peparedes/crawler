"event","Yeah. So the secret is out. Two people know; Break and Meghan. I can't believe I fucking said it. (No, I'm not telling you what the fuck I'm talking about. :D)

I went to visit Robbie (My little brother) today. It was cool. He saved my letter to Meghan for me. That is so fucking cool of him. I'm going to give him money for that. Like 15 dollars or something. :). I'm in a little better mood than before.

I don't really know what to update about... We did spring cleaning, and now I have my own room. :D. The computer is in my room, so now I can be online all night, while I don't work in the mornings because I'm quitting McDonalds. I'm going to go get a job at Wal Mart or something like that. Haha, it's going to fucking suck if I can't. I'll be fucking jobless. A jobless dropout. ... Yeah, that'll probably happen. I'll live in a fucking box. :3

What the fuck.

I think I'm going to give all my stuff on gaia away again
except like, the stuff people gave me. There's nothing else to update about wtf. Have fun."

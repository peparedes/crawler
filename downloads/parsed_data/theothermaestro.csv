You know what you've set yourself up for, though, don't you?

You've turned aside the only person who's ever really cared about you and turned him into the opposite. At the same time, you've tried to find what you had just shunned in those who don't care about you but you find more attractive. Your one decision has caused all this, and it will continue to do so. Remember Shooting the Past? ""I don't want to sound all melodramatic, but you will always regret this, always."" Ever wonder why I sent it to you, why I said I identified with Oswald? Notice any similarities in the way we work?

It needed to be said. That's what the elephant in the room is. And it's always going to be there; it's not going to get any smaller. I wonder if Mick Jagger had this in mind:

It's almost weird to look back at what I wrote earlier about how bad it seemed to be.

I also learned a lot about myself, particularly that I'm forgetful, messy, and get sick really easily. And despite my worst fears (some of which came true at times) I highly enjoyed myself this year, and do hope that I have made some good friends; ones that I've been able to not scare off (my bad). I hope this summer will be good - taking Japanese will be intense but hopefully it will be fun...maybe... Meh, we'll see what happens."

"event","I've had the best weekend I've had in a long time. Sarah Beth came and visited me at Swarthmore (after 9 months of separation! Think of the possibilities...). I didn't know I could enjoy myself so much with a just friend. It's been a very long time since I've enjoyed myself to such an extent.

""Just say you love me now
And forget this whole row
Just save your energy
For making up with me""

I knew you were going to question coming here: After all that's happened, you had no reason to assume that this was going to be a good weekend. I was worried myself about the same thing. But this time was different. We talked about the things we needed to, but didn't do so in a confrontational way. We knew that this needed to end, and we worked to do so. It was entirely necessary that we talked openly and unashamedly about the things we've done which have made us mad. I wasn't lying when I said that this has been a bad relationship in the past. During my road trip with my brother, I was seriously considering never speaking to you again. However, as I said, I realized that I couldn't lose your friendship. 1) It's simply too valuable to me, and 2) feeling that I drove someone as purely good as you away would have made me feel terrible about myself. I can't let myself lose you - much as you deny it, you are the nicest person I've ever met by far, and the only one I feel that I can trust.

I only hope that I've allayed your fears about me. Like I said, I'm not going to go after you again, much as it does hurt to actually accept that. I really don't want to fight with you anymore. Now that we've talked about everything that's made me mad, I understand that much of my anger was imposing my own interpretation on events which weren't true. I think that the key here is honesty - we need to tell each other all of what's going on. The truth can hurt, but not nearly as much as knowing that you're being kept in the dark. We know each other well enough to tell when we're being honest or not. We should be done being manipulative with each other - this goes for both of us.

I meant it when I said that we're still going to be friends when we're 60. I think you're the only person I know to whom I can honestly say that. You bring out the best in me: Nobody else makes me want to be as loving, happy, and outgoing as you do. I can only hope that I can support you in some small way to make up for this debt. Like I said, I'm here for you, whenever you need it. Don't worry about hurting me: As long as it's legit, I'll listen to it :P 

I remember you too for airports. I'm the happiest and the saddest in them, when I see you come or leave. I miss you already. 

""No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Can make me feel bitter or treat you unkind""

Goodbye, special friend."

The only real way to describe the past while since I've updated is with the word ""confusion."" Confusion because I'm really not sure where I'm going.

When Daisy read my tarot, she said that my main issue was how and where to spend my energy and thought. It makes me feel that it's only my rationalist bias that prevents me from believing in mysticism when fortune telling is so accurate. 

""As soon as you leave here, you'll remember you don't believe in all that fortune telling crap. You're in control of your own destiny, remember?""
~The Oracle, The Matrix

I hope I am. But historically speaking, I haven't been so good at it. I've missed so many opportunities in so many areas, I wonder if it wouldn't be better if someone else was controlling my destiny. But I don't really want that. I'm being silly.

But it's odd because I do know what I need to do, I'm really only afraid to do it. Which calls into question the rest of what I do. 

For instance, I just talked to Julia online for the first time in months. It's odd becuase we used to be quite good friends. But for some reason, when we went to college, we stopped talking. It's not like distance stopped us from talking before, she's always lived in Kansas and I've always lived in, well Massachusetts. Pennsylvania isn't right next to Kansas or anything. It was fun talking to her, but I couldn't get this feeling of doubt out of my stomach just telling me ""why bother?"" It's not the first time I've had that feeling in my life, but the first time ever when referring to being friends or not with another person. That's a feeling that just doesn't occur to me. And I don't get it. 

So I guess the confusion is not really what I should do, but rather over can I do it? It would take a great deal of courage on my part, and I'm not sure I have that in me. And would I be missing out on a big part of life if I did it?

"event","People get mad at the world because they realize that things should be better than they are. For me, I was getting mad becuase I thought that I should be a better person than I am. My period of angst is over, due to reading Crime and Punishment (my new favorite book ever) and a conversation I had at Sharples:

Basically, what happened was that one guy asked me if I thought that life was worth living in the abstract sense. As I am not contemplating suicide, I answered that I thought that life was worth living in the abstract sense. My two companions at the lunch table disagreed, saying that there was no meaning to our existence.

My emo trip ended when I realized what it meant for life not to be worth living in any sense. Life not being worth living in an abstract sense means that there is some value to life that is inherently unattainable, as if our existence were a cosmic joke (a hypothesis greatly supported by the general quality of Sharples food). Note that it does not mean that there is no value to life whatsoever - if there were no value to life at all, then the question of whether or not it was worth living would be entirely irrelevant and not worth asking. This in turn means that human faculties are necessarily incapable of attaining the goals that have been laid out for us. These goals must have been laid out for us in advance for us to define them and realize that we are unable to attain them.

The implications of this are rather unfortunate: It means that all actions in our life are meaningless. No matter what seeming greatness we may accomplish, it is irrelevant, as it is merely playing along with the joke - acting while plugged into the matrix. The problem for us, then, is that there is no Neo to save us from the matrix, no hero to remove us from Plato's cave. The endpoint of this mindset is ethical solipsism - since there is no meaning to the world we see around us, ethical action becomes irrelevant, as it has no endpoint value. 

Fortunately for those of us who do not wish to take ""the other way out,"" I think that this position falls apart when meaning is described. Remember, for life not to be worth living, there has to be some sort of grand meaning that we can never acheive, meaning that all our actions within life are meaningless. Those who defend this position are forced into arguing that some grand figure must have laid down this meaning before human existence began, otherwise the idea that there is some inherent value to human life we just can't figure out would be ridiculous. The only recognizable figure I know for this definer of human value is God.

Now, for those of you hoping that I would go on an atheist tangent right here, I'm afraid that I'll have to dissapoint you. I'm not quite that way anymore. But I do think that that particular conception of God is wrong (that's right, I've gone from atheist to heretic, w00t). I think that God is actually a metaphor for our own hearts and emotions (you are saying: ""Did he just say that?""). But yes, I think that, strange as it sounds coming from me, Truth is found in following our own hearts. It's strange to describe as it defies logic. ""The Alchemist"" by Paulo Coelho is about as close as anybody gets to it. Only listening to your heart allows you to see this Truth. Another way of thinking about it is that commiting an evil action causes you to feel uncomfortable in your gut. Raskolnikov discovers that his conscience overpowers his logic after his murders in ""Crime and Punishment."" The Zennists get close to describing this as well. What I'm saying is, religious texts, when read with this in mind, support my hypothesis.

Thus, I don't see God as an arbitrary X-files like ""the truth is out there"" figure, I see it as something that we can all relate to personally and make our own truth out of. This means that meaning for us isn't arbitrary and necessarily unattainable; it's something we make up for ourselves, meaning that it is achievable at least in the abstract sense so long as we don't have megalomaniac dreams (but hey, if you do, I know this guy called Nietsczhe who'd just love to talk to you). 

Of course the argument still exists that our lives are quite small and probably insignificant on a cosmic level. The ethical solipsism this invites is answered by only one word: Love. Unlike some Harvard undergrads I know, I do believe in this phenomenon. And the reason I believe in this is because it's our only way out of perpetual uncertainty. If we don't see anything as meaningful, then there's really no answer to the question of how we should act. Again with my Russian literature trip, Pechorin in ""A Hero of Our Time"" demonstrates how acting in this way ends up hurting the entire society in which he exists. Pechorin acts with regard only for his personal interest and pleasure, hurting others. Even if our lives are insignificant, the fact of the existence of others mandates we act in such a way as to preserve their interests and pleasures, as well as ours. 

Love is not an arbitrary ethic; it is a compulsion we feel, transcending rationality. There is no rational explanation for why we do it; those who are insistent that logic explains the world are at a loss to explain it. But those who ignore it are even more at a loss to explain human action. It is at the center of human experience - those who ignore it ignore what it means to be alive. 

I'd say more, but I'm getting tired of this post, and I'm just preaching anyway. Lame."

"event","I can't really understand what makes me so depressed about being here. I don't know if my extreme melancholy tonight is caused by or is the cause of my extreme drunkeness. I think I'm sobering up now, so there won't be so many typos as there might be otherwise, but I'm certainly under the influence.

The title is the real question: What am I doing in this place?

Maybe I should just take the advice of ""The Weatherman"" to heart - I should just accept my place in life. I'm destined never to belong.

It's odd, as much as I've changed myself through coming here (I've gotten a lot nicer to people since coming here; I've even surprised myself what I could do) I don't feel as though I have a place here. Or anywhere, for that matter.

It's funny what comes upon you past 2:30AM. As I wrote that last paragraph I've realized that I've never really found a place where I've belonged, ever. Nobody's really cared ever, maybe that's why I am the way I am. 

But in reality, I'm probably blaming others too much. In the end, I do have the choice to be how I am, and it really is my fault I can't belong anywhere. 

Can it be that I, Daniel del Nido, am becoming a fatalist?

Can it be that I, who used to believe so much in my own abilities to do things, find myself incapable of satisfying my smallest need?

But I am a bit like Richard Nixon: I've changed myself many times, though I can't seem to be right. That's what the problem is, I can't do anything right. No matter how I try, I always fuck something up and never find myself being who I want to be, doing what I want to do.

2 Conclusions:

1. I belong in ""Elizabethtown:"" I am a substitute person. I'm not meant to do anything important. In Turgenev's ""Fathers and Sons,"" Bazarov realzes at the end that his own existence is fundamentally meaningless; It's almost a good thing that I'm realizing this before he does. There's really nothing that I'm meant to do apart from making others happy in whatever way they want. There's really nothing more that I'm destined to do. Which brings me to

2. Predestination. You may not believe in this, but every rule has an exception, right? Well, I am that. The fight against fate is meaningless: I am destined to be meaningless. It's funny to think on it now: Pretty much everything I thought I did well in high school was just that - thinking highly of myself. There was really no backing to it. Only now do I see just how false all that was: I'm incapable of doing anything worth recognition - it's just not in my life story to do so. 

Notes from my mind:

1. Dreams never come true. Dreams are an invitation for failure and disappointment. Whenever I dream of something, the opposite happens. Dreaming is pointless, it only makes me disappointed in what happens in life. 

2. I'm my own worst enemy. My faults are entirely my own. I don't belong to my surrounding, not the other way around. 

3. Independence is a lie. There's no such thing as individualism being important. How you fit into a group is the only thing that matters.

4. Plato was right. The world that exists in your imagination is the best one out there. The problem is comparing it to your real life. Then you realize just how bad things are.

5. Hope is the worst emotion, not frustration. Hope is our way of hankering after what we know we'll never have. Hope is the only precursor to despair. Remove the cause, the effect goes away. 

As if writing shit here's gonna make a difference..."

"event","I generally detest complaining. To me, it's the same thing as bitching for no reason other than to prove to others how strong you are because you can deal with X or Y problem. Of course, it's a natural thing, so this is my forum for doing so.
Sorry.

I'm not very happy here.

I wish I wasn't so socially awkward. If I'm stuck in a room with somebody, I'll just go silent because I don't know what to say. Everything comes out wrong, it's like I just can't do anything right. And people notice that and so I'm not really seen as important here. People don't really care whether I'm around or not - I'm just sort of a warm body that might or might not be around once in a while. The worst part is, I know it's entirely my fault. If I wasn't so speechless in like every social situation this probably wouldn't be happening. But as it is, I am, and nothing ever seems to work.

Classes are fine I guess, even though I hate doing bio work. And I've just found out that I might not get my AP credits that I thought I was, making this lab a total waste of time. Upper classmen always make me feel dumb in class, and other freshman really just don't care. And there's a whole lot of reading to do. Some of it's fine like the Russian novel readings, even though that's a huge chunk of my day. But often times history readings and especially bio readings can be dry and often I'll have hundreds of pages to do each night. I know I can't complain because other people are doing more than I am, but I already feel bored with it, which I thought wasn't supposed to happen in college.

I can't really think of much to look forward to, except break I guess. I wish people in other colleges weren't always busy, it's bad not to have any friends to talk to. My days are constantly spent trying to finish something, whether its work or waiting for someone to show up so I have something to do. I don't really enjoy myself very often. But now that I think of it, I haven't really enjoyed myself for a long time. Not since Alexander and I were on the road, really. It just seems like everything that happens to me is more of the same - nothing really changes. For as long as I can remember, things have been just long stretches of despondency punctuated by a few fleeting moments of fun. 

I don't know why I can't just be happy with what I have, though. ""The Weatherman"" had it right - generally when we try to be something better than we are we fail. We just have to accept what life gives us. Neither David Spritz nor I will probably ever get what we really want. If it weren't for so many people I see around me with the Golden Touch I wouldn't be so frustrated. But I've always dealt with people better than I am at everything, so I've never really ever been able to define myself in any way other than in relation to others, which is inevitably really depressing, because much as I'd like to think that there was, there's really not much about me that's special or interesting. 

Maybe if I'd done something differently, made some type of life decision when I was younger I wouldn't be this way. If I had been different before, maybe I wouldn't be so bad now. But I guess there's no real point in questioning now. I need to just accept who I am and live with it. It's a sad fact that no matter how much I try, I can't just be happy where I am, with what I have. Goodness, there are so many things I hate about myself.


""Why is it, would you say, that some people seem to get whatever they want in life? Everything they touch turns to gold. Whereas others can strive and strive and have nothing. I wonder, do you believe in luck? Do you think some men are lucky and some men just aren't and nothing they can do about it?"""

- My dorm smells funny.

- Our hall is really loud but friendly. Today they spoke French at me and I don't know a single word of French so I dealt with it to the best of my ability.

- I know what classes I want to take but haven't registered yet. I think I'll get most of them but will probably have to reschedule one, oh well.

- People on the whole are very friendly and nice.

- There's this psychology professor who spoke at our first ""Collection"" (Quaker meeting but in our case not so quaker) who was hilarious. I wanna beeeee hiiiimmmmmmm.

- I'm surprised to find that I have a few friends who I can unconditionally talk to already. 

- I play music really loudly.

- Everything's so beautiful - flowers and trees all over the place and even the buildings look nice.

- I'm worried about a lot of things like classes and friends, but I think I'm all right for now.

- My CA (Campus Advisor) group is awesome.

- I didn't fail the calculus placement test. 

- I took the Spanish placement test for no reason and I was too lazy to get my results, but I can get them tomorrow.

- I've been walking more and eating healthier. I wonder if I can keep that up.

- I can't find a soap dish. 

- Our entire floor has one mens room. Interesting.

- There are 2 pool tables in the student center. There are no cues or balls. Suck.

"event","I think I'm a cross between Eeyore and Piglet. At times, I'm needlessly gloomy, and at others I'm bobbish and happy. 

I was pleasantly surprised to hear about how well Sarah Beth's debate retreat went. Usually, these things are sessions testing the limits of the words ""wild debauchery,"" but in her case, it turned out to be 4 days testing the limits of the words ""awesome"" and ""fun."" 

And now, she goes to Emory tomorrow. 5 days after, I'll be at Swarthmore.

I've been really unnecessarily gloomy these past few days. Maybe it's because I've been so bored. The two things I've done have been to see Miami Vice and to find out that my IQ is 135. That's kinda lame, folks. And so, I was getting lost in my own thoughts, which, naturally, turned gloomy fast, aided by my strange addiction to unhappy music. 

I should be talking to people more...

And, now that I am, I'm feeling better already. In fact, I feel almost hopeful about going to Swarthmore. Before, I only wanted to go because it was going to be more interesting than Lexington. Now, I wanna go and go crazy, and yea yea yea do work and all that stuff. I feel hopeful about going and making friends and doing cool stuff with cool people and having fun parties and in general having a good time.

And no, to those who worry while reading this, I won't forget about doing work. 

But really, it's about time I stopped caring so much about everything. Everything's gonna go fine for all of the people I know who are going to college. For Supal, it's already going great, and for Sarah Beth and Pat, starting tomorrow the insanity shall begin in earnest. Why was I so worried? And if things don't go so well for me, then what's so bad? 

I can't stop listening to that Frou Frou song - ""there's beauty in the breakdown.""

I was dreaming so much I forgot about reality. The best things are always right in front of us, as long as we want to see them. Whoever said ""all good things come to those who can wait"" is wrong. All good things come to those who can see them. 

I love listening to music in the truck with the windows open when I drive it, because it makes me feel free and, quite frankly, unstoppable. I'm just gonna say that because I feel like it and end that paragraph.

Anybody notice how I always seem to make really short paragraphs?"

"event","Thanks so much for all your help and words of encouragement.&nbsp; Blue seems to be on the road to recovery - she has regained some mobility and hopes are high that she will get all of it back.&nbsp; She perks right up when someone comes to see her and is back to tormenting my parent's dog :)&nbsp; It was so nice to get words of encouragement from this community!&nbsp; I really needed it and it helped immensely.&nbsp; Please keep sending Blue happy recovery thoughts!&nbsp; 

A note about the neighborhood kids - I went around the block, and handed out a little note to all the neighbors basically saying that just because the rabbits are out playing on the lawn does not mean that you are allowed to open the cage to play with them.&nbsp; Ring the doorbell and if I'm not at work I would love to come out and have them play with you.&nbsp; Also, if you are admiring them and accidents happen (like the door ""accidently"" opens) please come find me - I'll be way less mad if you tell me.&nbsp; I made sure to include the bit about Blue's back injury.&nbsp; This is really the best I can do because I have no proof about who actually did it. 

Needless to say, bunnies are staying inside for the time being.&nbsp; 

THANKS AGAIN EVERYONE!&nbsp;"

I feel really bad because Wendy drove out to State College to pick me up, but I had emailed her and told her that there was just no way that I was going to get to Bellefonte tonight.  Guess what?

She came anyway.  

Arg.  I feel bad.  But there was nothing that I could have done.  

This weekend was JUST what the doctor ordered.  Time with robos, friends, good food, got my dress hemmed, and Greyhound was even on time!  Everything just clicked, and I love them.

"event","So, over two months later, I finally make an entry.  Big suprise! 

So, college, bitches!  It is amazing.  Midterms are eating my soul, but that's only to be expected.  I love the fact that I already need to be making decisions about my classes next semester, and where I'll be living next year - ARGH!!!!!  I'm really going to try to get an apartment with someone - maybe Becca (cuz the rest of them want to live in Earth House I think) - it's so much cheaper and I'll get to have my bunbuns with me!!!!!  It's mad crazy how much I miss them.  

I'm not gonna lie - college is harder than I thought for me.  Anyone that knows me knows that there is no lost love between me and my parents, but I miss home much more than I thought I would.  Little things - like dinner being ready, and the CAR when I need it, and my little sister, and my old life.  Not that this one isn't good, it's just different and I haven't quite made the switch.  It's HARD to share a room!  I'm afraid that my roomie is getting a tad annoyed with my snoring, but I'm trying to be good :)  

I do love Penn State, though.  I really do - I feel like I belong here so much more than back home. People know what I'm talking about when I say a springing heifer, and I can actually connect with people in my major, and I feel like I'm home.  

Time to finish labs before heading off to a scholarship banquet!!!! and a math midterm.  And an english paper . . .  

Peace, Hannah"

"event","<p>Hello All!</p>
<p>Summer has been so hectic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; June was spent working at the Pet store and working at 4-H camp.&nbsp; 1st week of July was spent working as well.&nbsp; 2nd week of July was spent at Lycoming College in Williamsport being ""trained"" as a dairy princess.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure still how I feel about that.&nbsp; Pretty much it was a wasted week and I'm glad I never have to do it again *wipes brow in relief*.&nbsp; However, I have been to several events as a dairy princess and it is a ton of fun!!!!!!!&nbsp; 3rd week of July was spent in intense heat and with several million biting bugs in Hickory Run State Park as a counselor at 4-H Camp Shehaqua.&nbsp; It is always a super fun time - some of my very good friends came and I had such a nice week, albeit an extremely hot week.&nbsp; 4th week of July was the KIMBERTON FAIR which merits its own paragraph.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Kimberton is such a fun week.&nbsp; I stayed out at the fairgrounds all week, and I just love it.&nbsp; So, in case anyone cares, here are the results.&nbsp; I was first in fitting (how clean and well prepared the cow was) and 2nd in fitting (how well I showed the animal).&nbsp; I was really really happy!&nbsp; Dusty, my brown swiss (the one in my background) was 1st in her type class (how well made the animal is - if anyone wants me to go into detail on cow judging I am more than happy to!), Junior Champion in the open class as well as in the 4-H class, reserve Grand Champion of the open Brown Swiss show, and Grand Champion of the 4-H Brown Swiss Show!!!!!!! I am so proud of her.&nbsp; I am also proud of myself because at the beginning of the year I picked her out of the 6 choices I had, and she has just done so well.&nbsp; My older cow, Beezi, who is the love of my life and my good friend, had a very large bull calf in late March.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it died (it didn't get enough oxygen during the birth) and poor Beezi had a very rough start to her first lactation.&nbsp; Her udder is very small but very correct!!!!!! She also gained some weight after her tough birth so she looked good.&nbsp; Anyway, I used her in showmanship and fitting (thanks girl!).&nbsp; She was 1st in her type class, reserve 4-H senior champion of the Lineback show, and reserve 4-H grand champion of the Lineback show!!!!!!!!!! She has matured into such a nice little cow, and in the future I hope to purchase one of her daughters!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This past week has been crazy - my parents left on July 22 for SanFran along with my little sis, so the house has been very quiet - which I love.&nbsp; I need to clean my room so badly though, it isn't funny.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; I also need to take inventory of all the things that I have amassed for college and what I still need to get :)&nbsp; <strong>27 days and counting - can you believe it???????&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>I also got a job because of a really ballsy thing that I did!&nbsp; I gave my name and phone number to this lady who is the herd manager at Seven Stars Farm in Phoinexville.&nbsp; The owner, Edie, called me about 2 weeks ago and long story short I have an awesome job for the next 2 weeks!!!!!! I still can't believe it - the pay is unbelievable and the experience is worth so much.&nbsp; Hopefully this will secure me a job for next summer and the experience will help me get employment up at Penn State!!!!!!&nbsp; I milk on Wednesday Thursday, and Saturday&nbsp;mornings from 3:30 to app. 6:30 or 7:00, then I go home, shower, and SLEEP! till about noon.&nbsp; It is awesome.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know that this entry wasn't really about <em>me</em> and my total mental state, however things have happened of recent that are rather private and it wouldn't be fair to other parties if I was to talk about them here - I hope everyone understands.&nbsp; Plus, let's be honest - everyone knows that my cows are the most important to me anyway.&nbsp; Aside from friends, of course :)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I love you all.&nbsp; </p>"

"event","Here's an update on the poor bun surrendered at my pet store.  

He was brought in late Monday evening by the b****** owner.  She just walked in, plopped a cardboard box on the counter, and left.  Inside was a jet black, TINY TINY TINY bun.  Sweetest most innocent thing in the world.  I immediately named him Georgie.  It just seemed to fit.  I set up a nice spacious cage for him, and he seemed to settle right in.  After observing him for a while, I noticed that he was semi eating and drinking.  I spoke to the vet on call at the hospital where I usually take my buns, and he advised to wait until morning - keep a close eye on him, force feed, ect and bring him in first thing when my savvy vet would be there.  He made it through the night fine, when I got to the office at first inspection my vet agreed with me - his leg had been broken a few days ago, and with good luck and a cast he would hopefully make a full recovery.  I left him at the vet's to get his cast, and I was supposed to get a call saying when I could pick him up.  And plus - my vet told me this was free of charge.  However, about 45 minutes later, I got this call:

""We took him into the back room and gently sedated him to get xrays, so we could see exactly where it was broken.  Instead, we found that his leg isn't broken - it is massivly infected.  The infection appears so advanced that it has spread to his abdomen - he will never recover.  This has been left untreated for over 2 weeks, and if the previous owners had taken him to a vet when he first started limping, he would be fine now. He's already asleep - do we have your permission to put out of his pain?""

I was overcome by tears.  I asked them to hold on, and I sped over to the office.  I held him as my vet injected him.  He passed peacefully, and I hope that he knew that although I only knew him for a short time, he was deeply loved.  

Thank you to all for your amazing support.  I appreciate all the offers and help I received in terms of adoption.  It meant so so much to me.  Also, my vet asked me for the family's name and phone number.  My vet is going to ""contact"" them, and I have no doubt whatsoever that she will read them the riot act.  She is also going to perform an autopsy, and she will decide whether to pursue the family criminally.  That is so great, because I'm still just an 18 year old kid and she has a well established veterinary practice - she will be able to get things done.  

Please everyone, hug your buns for me.  Remember a little black bunny named Georgie."

I am a bit frustrated with my 4-H leader.  He says that since I'm a senior and all, I should be sort of fading into the background and all, and help out the younger kids.  But dammit, I worked hard, and I am not going to back out now.  He won't lease me the heifer I really want (she's from Canadian stock and her bloodlines are superb) and therefore I can't go to Junior Dairy show or the Farm show (b/c my original cow is a Lineback and that's not an offical recognized breed - yet!).  It just makes me feel like Robotics did last year -I am expected to do all the dirty work and get none of the credit.  Oh well - I'll get the opportunity to do it in college.  It's just frustrating, that's all.  

Anyways, I got back from Penn State today.  Dairy Days was awesome.  I really liked the judging.  I have to go to the farm tomorrow and evaluate our animals.  I think that the Swiss is going to do well this summer, but only time will tell.  I need to do some clipping PRONTO.  Then we can see how much we have to work with.  

Sigh.  I also have to start trailor training tomorrow.  Should be awesome.  Oh yeah - hauling 3 irritated heifers against their will up into a trailor. Sweet.  

I may bitch about them, but I still love those biddies.

Of course, the constant sneezing and the ever famous (and may I add, pleasant) nasal drip has made my throat very sore and scratchy - the day before Six Pack and the biggest solo (aside from O Holy Night) that I have ever had.  OH FUCKING BOY!  And of course we don't keep Benedryl in the house - now why would we do a sensible thing like that?  Goddamn.  

The new calves are here!  One (hopefully the one I'll own for the season)is healthy, one has some kind of warts on the right side of her face and one her ears, and the other has had horrible diarreah for about 1.5 weeks now.

Plus I realized that it was a pretty stupid thing to give up for Lent. Oh well. 

I'm pretty busy, and I'm actually doing homework for once!!! I have quite a few things due tomorrow, but yet here I am on LJ. . . 

I've also had to start reviewing things for my PSU chem, english, and math placement tests. It bites. Seriously. I remember little to nothing about chem and math, and these placement tests are going to be rather interesting. 

My room is rather stuffy. 

Prom was actually fairly uneventful. I don't think that there was any serious drama at the aquarium (which was pretty cool BTW), and I had a not horrible time - I just love getting intensely dressed up, made up, and just letting it go on the dance floor (which I rarely do b/c as a person of substance I am awfully self-concious).

"event","Ok - I have a slight problem. <br /><br />My little demon bun, Bea, ate the same salad as her girlfriend and the baby (who isn't really a baby anymore *tear*) last night. This morning, I noticed before I left for school that one of the girls had runny poop (I knew it wasn't the baby cuz he doesn't live with them, but I checked just in case). Upon close inspection of bunny bottoms, I knew right away that Bea was the culprit. Tonight, 2 hours and many, MANY scratches later, she now has a clean bottom again. There weren't anymore runny poops, and I have seen her poop since this incident - and all seemed normal. Do I need to be concerned?

"event","<P>&nbsp;I had a most scarring event happen to me at work on Saturday. Let's have a timeline, shall we? I think yes. </P>
<P>12:30 PM - I go on my required AND unpaid 45 minute break (you know we minors tire easily) and upon my return, go to the back room, where the bathroom is, and discover nothing amiss. I leave the key in the door, which Pet Valu employees have been doing since dinosaurs walk the Earth (and have never had any problems), and walk back up to the register to help a customer. 2:00 PM - Nick (my *hot* coworker) asks for the key so that he can go to the bathroom. I inform him of its current whereabouts, and he sets off for the toilet. </P>
<P>2:00 PM and 20 seconds - ""Hannah, you need to come back here and see this. I mean seriously, come back here and see this."" With a feeling of impending doom, I set off for the back of the store. I almost scream when I see what awaits me. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair, my friends, of rouge underwears. Not just normal underwears - SHIT COVERED UNDERWEARS. The toilet was also left unflushed. </P>
<P>My first thought - ""Oh shit.""</P>
<P>&nbsp;My second thought - ""Where is all the money?"" We keep all of our backup money in a safe in that back room (the safe is not usually locked - we are not too smart at Pet Valu), and the door is open and the safe is empty. Nick screams like a girl, and then remembers that he took the money up to the front to reload the register, so no one stole the money. </P>
<P>My third thought - ""Why is there a pair of rouge underwears on my store's bathroom floor"""" </P>
<P>My fourth thought - ""Why it covered in shit and the toilet left unflushed?"" </P>
<P>My fifth thought - ""I'm gonna have to clean this up. GodDAMN it."" </P>
<P>The Bottom Line:&nbsp; Someone, without permission, used my key to open our store's back room, shat their pants, did the rest in the toilet, removed their underwear, left it on the floor, left the back room (with the toilet UNFLUSHED), went up to the front of our store, BOUGHT something, and then departed like nothing unusual had happened. </P>

<P>I think that this story makes everyone feel like this.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Peace to all.&nbsp; </P>"

<P>Univeristy of Findlay - ACCEPTED!&nbsp; Letter received Jan 5, 2006.&nbsp; Safety school in the middle of Ohio.&nbsp; Scholarship - 11,000$.&nbsp; Last resort</P>
<P>Delaware Valley College - ACCEPTED! Letter recieved Jan 10, 2006.&nbsp; Safety school in Doylestown, PA (the other side of Philly from the Main Line).&nbsp; 1Scholarship - 11,500$.&nbsp; 2nd to last resort.&nbsp; </P>
<P>University of New Hampshire - ACCEPTED!!!!!!!!!! NOT a safely school; a <EM>realistic</EM> school.&nbsp; This one wasn't absolutely in the bag from the beginning.&nbsp; No scholarship (ach, well).&nbsp; In the middle range on my desirability scale.&nbsp; EXCITING NEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</P>
<P>Here's the rest of my choices in order of preference:</P>
<P>PENN STATE - #1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Still waiting, but should be anyday now!!!!!!!!</P>
<P>University of Delaware - #2.&nbsp; I head mid march *heaves a sigh*</P>
<P>University of Maine / University of Maryland / University of New Hampshire (YAY!) / University of Vermont / University of Connecticut- currently tied.&nbsp; Maryland - great academics, AWESOME location (plus!) but no real facilities (BIG minus).&nbsp; University of Maine - so so school overall, GREAT ag program, GREAT facilities (big plus!).&nbsp; University of Vermont / University of New Hampshire / University of Connecticut - pretty much equals;&nbsp; great Ag and Dairy programs, but I haven't visited either of them in person yet, so I haven't really gotten a good feel for the environment.&nbsp; All are still very much in the running!!!!!! </P>
<P>Virginia Tech - I applied here to please my parents.&nbsp; I don't really expect to get in (it's very competitive for Northern applicants) and I don't really like their program and the location (can you just imagine me as a Southern Belle?&nbsp; I don't THINK so!) Currently - last place.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am SO totally out of here come next fall!!!!!! Thank the sweet Jesus.&nbsp; <BR>Oh, and by the way, for Terms and others who I've enlighted - there have still been no college congradulations from my mother.&nbsp; :)<BR></P>"

"event","Well, ho ho ho.  Here we are again, another year past, and another one to begin.  For some odd reason, I always think of Christmas as the start of the next year, never actually New Years.  Bizarre.  H'anyway, here are my Christmas thoughts:

1)  If you don't celebrate Christmas, that's ok.  I just wish I could wish people a sincere ""Merry Christmas"" instead of ""Happy Holidays"" (which I detest) and not get LOADS of shit over it.  

2)  I know, I'm succumbing to the new AmericanExpressmas (as Liz so beautifully put it), but I would REALLLLLLY like a digital camera to be under the tree tomorrow morning with a tag, ""To Hannah, Love Santa"".  

3)  I hope that I get into the college of my choice, and that when I have to go away to college somehow I can find a home for my bunnies that's NOT with my aunt b/c I would really really not like her to have them but the way it's going, that's what might have to happen.  Please, let it all work out ok.  

4)  Seriously, everybody, world peace.  There is too much fighting going on abroad and in my own home, and I would really like some peace.  

5)  By now it's kinda a moot point, but I would like to drop a few pounds before I leave next year so that all the kids at college don't label me the fat girl, like everyone at AIS has.  Hey, I'm supposed to have at least ONE thing that it completely unrealistic.  .  

6)  I hope that Beezi has a healthy baby girl calf (I think the dairy industry might be the only one where the females are desired - now the rest of the world follow that example) and that she and her mom and I do SPECTACULARLY at our summer fairs (it would totally be the best going away present).  

7) I am sososososososososo excited to visit Liz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  May we be able to visit each other more often.  

8) May everyone who is having a hard time right now just living (including myself) find joy and happiness in something during the coming year.  

HAPPY CHRISTMAS, BLESSED SOLSTICE, LOVELY HAUNUHKA, SPLENDID KWANZA, and WONDERFUL FAMILY DAY TO ALL (anyone else, you're just piggybacking on the above themes so just get over the fact that I didn't mention you specifically)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Once again it is Friday.  And once again I find myself with absolutely nothing to do.  I'm not working.  I'm just going to spend a nice quiet evening at home.  Well, actually, this is untrue.  I find myself with no INVITATIONS to do anything.  I am going to EA day, but at this point all my friends are going together, and I find myself the odd one out.  No one even told me what was going on.  And for Halloween, no one told me that everyone was going Trick-or-Treating at hmmhmm's house.  And when they did tell me, hmmhmm still didn't really invite me.  So I kind of invited myself over, and then I felt like a grade A tool.  I invite myself over a lot of times.  And now, same old, same old.  No invitation, and when I found out about it still no invitation.  I don't think that I would have been able to go anyway, but it's the principle of the thing.  For someone who claims to have a lot of friends, I sure do alot of things by myself.  
Damn guys.  Sorry for bitching.  I really should be writing this down in a place where no one who know's me can read it.  But I write so much better than I speak, and if I tried to say these things in words I would basically just come across as a whiny bitch who complains that she isn't involved in EVERY LITTLE THING!   And I really don't want that. I just had a really long week and I feel like I can't express this to anyone b/c everyone else had a really long week and are probably just as tired and just as cranky.  And I'm afraid my mother is going to pwn me and not let me go to EA day which would just be the icing on the cake.  And now I feel all hurt and cranky and insecure b/c for some reason I feel the need to poke my nose into everything and always be included, even times when maybe I should just accept the fact that I'm not (but I'm still loved).  And I don't think anyone gets that I feel so insecure pretty much all of the time.  I think that part of the reason that I can't stand the VOP's clingyness is because I totally see that just under the surface in myself, just waiting to come out.  When people read this, they're just going to be like - ""Oh quit whining and piting yourself - you know we love you and want you to do things with us!""  And I'm really not writing this for self pity.  Really, I'm not.  But that's what everyone's going to think.  
Sweet."

I love Lex sosososososo much, and Mr. Eric the Douchebag Fuckhead can go fuck himself in the ass with a cheesegrater.  And be ducktaped to a chair and forced to drink chunky milk mixed with urine.  

I'm going to visit Liz - but I need to talk to you so we can discuss logisitcs, ect.  CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU!!!!!!!

Eh.  I was full of brim and brimstone a few days ago, but at the moment I can't muster up any emotion whatsoever.  

OH!  The buns are now living in my room - they are so funny!  And Bea and Abbie need to be spayed.  Because they fight.  Even that is sometimes funny.  

*sigh*  My life needs a good soundtrack.  OOOH!  I am trying out for Les Mis - wish me luck!!!!!"

Her cage isn't in my room, but I keep a mini cage there in case she or her other bunny friends (Bea and Abbie) want to sleep over (actually, so I don't wake the whole house up creaking downstairs at midnight).  I closed the door, said goodnight, and went to bed.  I am woken up at 5:40 am by a large white weight on my chest.  At first I didn't even know what it was; I just was like ""wassutat?"" and looked at my clock.  I was fully awakened by her BITING me on the nose!  No out of spite or anything, more like a love bite, but it was shocking!  I sit straight up, she flies off the bed, and I still have no freakin clue as to how she opened her door and came to be on my bed."

"event","Well, here we are again on a Tuesday night.  I just got home from play practice (I have the best one liner EVER!), and although Ariel's singing may be doubtful, I think that MAYBE, just MAYBE, she could pull this off.  The one I'm really concered about is Andrew.  His singing skills are also mediocre, and unlike Ariel, so is his acting.  He just as one look, and it's not a good one.  Ach well, I can't be bothered by this play an longer.  I have places to be and things to do (well, I wish I had cool places to be.)  

Tomorrow should be interesting - Ima go to fencing, then the barn, and back to school by 6:30 for rehersal.  Yup, I'm not gonna pull that one off, I'll just tell you right now.  Sweeeeet.  

Life is dull.  Everyone seems caught up in their own agendas.  I haven't had a really good conversation in a long time, and someone's angst is beginning to get to me.  GET THE FUCK OVER YOURSELF!  I don't know if she reads LJ or not, but I'm just covering my ass in case.  I seem stuck, like everything is happening too quickly.  I have bullshat my way through everything so far this week.  I won't be able to do that for much longer.  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

I really need a friend right now.  But everyone is too busy.  And they all have their own (very real and legitimate, mind you) problems.  And the sucky part is, I AM TOO BUSY!  I go to school, I come home and work, and on my weekends I go to work, I come home, ect.  It's just one never ending sucky cycle.  I'm not angry at anyone really or accusing anyone of being awful friends, b/c I'm sure (esp. the seniors) that they are feeling the same way.  

In the past 3 days I have spent about 40 minutes total in my mother's presence and we have said MAYBE 3 - 5 sentences to each other.  I thought that I would love this.  Instead, it just makes me incredibly sad."

Dolly did end up being pwn3d.  She couldn't go to Districts, which means she can't go to States, which means she can't go to the Junior Holstein show, which means she can't go to the Farm show (I'm not 100% about that one).  It is serious pwnage, considering I might have to sell her before the show season next year.  I used Beezi for showmanship and fitting (which was judged as one class, oddly enough - they almost NEVER do that) and was 3rd out of 10.  I got a really pretty ribbon.  Beezi was 1st in her type class and junior champion!  *kisses for my cow*.  

I'm sick of working.  I don't want to write college essays, and I DON'T want to go back to wearing my kilt.  I got away w/ it last year, but this year MOM is cracking down.  Where IS my kilt?  Must find it . . . 

Love your Hannah

PS - Oh yeah, did I mention?  I def. left my phone at Districts.  This means call me at home - I WILL NOT ANSWER THE CELLIE!  No hope of recovery, and now I have to buy a new phone.  On the bright side, I now can get a really COOL phone, except that I really hope that I can keep my number, b/c I don't feel like informing everyone that it has changed.  WHOOT!"

That's right bitch - districts.  Only animals that have won 1st place can go.  This is one of 2 district shows in the entire state.  Dolly's gonna get pwn3d there, but thats ok.

UPDATES:

1.  4-H fair was awesome, as expected.  I got to chill w/ some old buddies and met some new people.  I helped to herd the pigs back and forth from their pen to the barn and I got bit on the leg.  No joke - I have pig bite marks.  It really sucks.  I was 1st and champion for showmanship, and I got a really pretty new ribbon.  

2.  I'm gathering school supplies, and I really don't want to.

3.  Blah.  My parents are yelling at me a lot more these days.  Their logic is (and my father actually told me this), "" You've been doing pretty well in the big picture, so we're going to nitpick at the small unimportant things.  Just to make sure you're on the straight and narrow.""

4.  Damn parents.  

5.  Liz started school.  That really sucks for her.  I love you Liz!

6.  I got some really funky new stuff at the mall, including a shirt that has a picture of a whippet (breed of dog) in a beanie w/ lots of bling playing a keyboard, and the caption is ""Whippet! Whippet good!"" .  And I love it.

"event","Ok, ok - I'll explain the title in a minute.  1st, a few quick updates.

1.  Frankie has started to drive. !?!?!  AAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEAAEAEFUCK!
2.  I won 2nd out of 7 for fitting and 3rd out of 7 for showmanship at Goshen.  I TOTALLY ROCK!
3.  Dolly was 1st in her type class!!!!!!!!!!  I am so proud of her!!!!!
4.  I'm back working at the pet store - what a reality check.  Luckily, I haven't really forgotten anything.  
5.  I got a new little bunbun at the Kimberton Fair!  She's a Lop / Rex Cross, and she has velvet instead of fur.  No joke - rex rabbits have this special fur that is the coolest thing ever.  Also, b/c she's a cross, one ear sticks up, and one ear flops down!  She's only a baby yet (9 weeks old), so maybe that will go away, but I hope not!  
6.  I was severely pwn3d by Bea, a tiny 3 pound brown rabbit with a (newly discovered) evil disposition.

To elaborate on #6 - On Wednesday morning, I took Elle and my new baby bunny Abbie to the barn w/ me so that the Chester kids would get to meet them.  I didn't take BeeBee b/c she's not so great w/ crowds of people.  So, in the afternoon, I took Dolly and Beezi to Goshen fair, and I called Mom at about 1 pm and asked her to check on Bea b/c it was really really hot and I wanted to make sure she had enough water.  She was fine.  I checked on her when I got home around 6 pm.  She was fine.  End of Day 1. 

Thursday - Day 2:  I wake up, shower, come downstairs to leave for camp.  Estimated time - 8:30 am.  Mom says, ""Have a nice day, don't come home too late, and by the way, your brown rabbit isn't in the hutch.""  Reply - ""WHAT THE F*** DO YOU MEAN SHE'S NOT IN THE HUTCH???????"" *mad dash outside to the hutch where it is confirmed that the rabbit is not, in fact, inside.  I panic, and race around the yard, shaking plants and looking under the tomatoes.  I have to stop and go to the barn, and I'm not in a very good mood for the last day of camp.  After camp, I go to Goshen to get ready for the show.  I get a couple of phone calls from Mom saying that the rabbit has been sighted, but no one can catch her.  End Day 2.  

Friday - Day 3:  I'm woken by mom pounding on the door at 7:10 am saying ""I found the rabbit!  Can't catch her, though - she's in the vegetable patch.""  I run outside in my flowery nightgown and chase the rabbit for over an hour.  No luck.  I set out a cage w/ water, food, and treats, hoping that she'll hop inside and then I can catch her.  11:30 am - she's in the cage, eating her little heart out, and I almost get the door closed, but she jumps out at the last minute.  1:00 pm - SUCCESS!!!!!!  I close the cage door, Bea continues to eat, I say that I'll just leave her on the lawn in the shade, b/c I have to clean the hutch.  1:20 pm - come back to the cage in time to see her (again, a 2.5 - 3lb rabbit) flip the cage over and scamper off.  My patience is wearing thin at this point.  2 pm - I go to work, hoping to hear from Mom, saying that the perp is in custody, but no suck luck.  I check the ""trap"" again at 9 pm when I get off work: Nothing.  End of Day 3

Saturday - Day 4:  I wake up at about 9, feeling sure that today will be the day.  I put out ice cubes, toast, alfalfa bits, treats, everything good for a rabbit.  I wait.  10 am - nothing yet.  I decide to take Gillian to Petsmart to get some new fish for her tank.  12 noon - nothing.  I haven't even seen her come out to get the food.  I search a little around the cage, and I discover her taking a nap underneath one of the giant bushes in front of the house.  She is taking a nap.  I get down on my knees and then my belly, so that I am only about 3 feet away from this rabbit.  We stare at each other for a minute or two, and then I just break down. I'm on my belly, face - down in the dirt, and I'm begging and pleading w/ this tiny rabbit to please just come home, b/c I can't take it anymore!  In the middle of my heartfelt groveling, she sits up, looks me in the eye, and begins to wash her face.  Just as I'm finishing, she sneezes, and saunters away.  Mocking me.  3:30 - I get ready to go to work, certain that she'll never come back, and thinking out ways that I could feed her w/ out actually caging her, and just generally giving up, surrendering to the smartest and sickest little brown bunny in the world.  7 pm - I get a call from Mom saying that GILLIAN has managed to capture her in the portable lawn cage.  I immediately screech into the phone to ""PUT A GIANT ROCK ON TOP OF IT!  PUT TWO OR THREE!!!!!! COVER THE TOP W/ ROCKS! DO IT NOW BITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""  My mother tells me to keep my hair on and hangs up on me.  I am so thrilled that I don't care.  9:30 pm - I put on Bea's new collar and ID tag, complete w/ little bell so I'll always know where she is.  Just in case.  END OF DAY FOUR AND RABBIT FUN

I just realized that my six year old sister was able to catch Bea and I wasn't.  This means I was also pwn3d by Gill.  What is this world coming to?"

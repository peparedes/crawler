"event","<i>Loooove this song, can't get enough of it. In fact, more of the music today should be created into something very similar to this one, heavenly sung by Josh Kelley. As odd and random as this sounds, lemme say that if it were to materialize and turn into a person (by magic), the result would be a sure-fire charmer and become instantly love/adored as people from many different walks of life will be drawn by him/her. Basically this song speaks for itself, and it's got a certain something that people can connect or relate to, or be uplifted by how easygoing the beat is, along with the sense of contentment with life, when all is right with the world. No drastic changes need to be made, and I certainly have no intention of changing a slight bit of this tune. It also doesn't hurt whatsoever that the lyrics are so darn cute, perfect for serenading a significant other/loved one. <= ~C~ </i>

Cause I saw you walking down the hall 
And I had a lot to tell you 
But I didn't think you could say it better oh baby

You're good at makin me feel so small 
And I know you made your point 
But I just don't want to remember yeah

And I know you've got the feelin

"event","<strong><font size=""2"">Hey J,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, I was just thinking&nbsp;back to last year, in June when&nbsp;my family and I flew all the way to Philippines to visit our cousins and relatives.&nbsp;And of course,&nbsp;to pick up Chelle&nbsp;once she was released&nbsp;from her mission.&nbsp;It's funny to think that&nbsp;the whole time I was there, it hadn't exactly struck me to write in my journal, especially&nbsp;on days where&nbsp;it had an impact on me, in which&nbsp;I <em>KNOW</em> there was&nbsp;a number of occasions&nbsp;where it&nbsp;would've&nbsp;made me feel a lot better and more at ease if I&nbsp;wrote it all down,&nbsp;from my thoughts to whatever&nbsp;I was&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;at that time. Sure, I jotted down a few things here and there, I recalled bringing&nbsp;a notebook... it came in handy during church service at San Nicholas ward. (Ok, that experience alone, returning to that chapel brought back&nbsp;many, random&nbsp;memories&nbsp;as a child, wow! And the chapel itself&nbsp;hadn't really changed much, except now I noticed -- no, <em>FELT</em> they installed air conditioners to the main rooms, like the sacrament room and the Sunday school room. There may have been others, but those&nbsp;ones I only&nbsp;had the chance to go&nbsp;in&nbsp;that had A/C haha). What was one&nbsp;of the most important things&nbsp;for me was to be able to communicate&nbsp;with some&nbsp;pals throughout our 3 week&nbsp;vacation back home. (Thank heavens for the creation of FACEBOOK! hahahaha :}) Wow, whoever said that&nbsp;being gone for 3 weeks&nbsp;is nothing compared to if you&nbsp;were away for the entire summer (2 whole months), they were RIGHT. It certainly feels like nothing, mainly b/c time goes by sooo fast and it feels even faster&nbsp;when you're&nbsp;back in&nbsp;your home country after nearly 9 years,&nbsp;thus the time difference is quite shocking and takes a couple of days to get used to. And&nbsp;gotta admit, there was also&nbsp;a bit of culture shock the moment you start&nbsp;taking in all&nbsp;your surroundings and interacting with&nbsp;all kinds of&nbsp;people. Most of the time&nbsp;during&nbsp;our daily outings&nbsp;and little trips to the mall,&nbsp;I felt&nbsp;2 things: a strong sense of familiarity, and it's as if everything from my childhood(prior to migrating to Canada) came flooding back to the forefront, but&nbsp;soon it is&nbsp;also tinged with the fact that things are more ""foreign"", obviously from living&nbsp;in the other side of the&nbsp;world for most of&nbsp;my life,&nbsp;things that used to be familiar now also seemed.... different. Like&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;be <em>re</em>-taught how to do certain things - Oh,&nbsp;the biggest out&nbsp;of them all was learning&nbsp;how to speak Cebuano on a more frequent basis. Gamay&nbsp;lang among ma sulti while we were there. Like the previous sentence,&nbsp;Christy and I had to mix&nbsp;our Cebuano with English, and&nbsp;the lack of accent was so&nbsp;noticeable to ALL our&nbsp;cousins and relatives! Even though&nbsp;SOME (I'd like to point out the <u>opposite</u>&nbsp;of them being my uncle,&nbsp;who was not afraid to voice his opinion! No matter what, he wanted to hear a Cebuano sentence being uttered from our mouths!)&nbsp;of them never showed&nbsp;it or commented&nbsp;about it, I could just&nbsp;tell after I've exchanged a few words to them that they were exchanging knowing looks towards each other and&nbsp;going, ""This girl is&nbsp;so Canadian-<em>ized</em>!"" In their ears I must have sounded exactly like the missionaries who came from different parts of the world, who, even though could speak the language and understood it, there was still that accent that revealed all. Lol XP.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life in the Philippines was simple. But the fact that it was very simple and&nbsp;almost every person&nbsp;there lived a simple life was what also made it difficult and challenging. And&nbsp;being there, even for just a short amount of time, I had a taste of how&nbsp;tough life can be. Where to even begin, from the&nbsp;high poverty that people are experiencing due to&nbsp;everything being so expensive, even staple foods like rice&nbsp;or bread is&nbsp;becoming more and more costly over there. Basic necessities, things that people need on a day-to-day basis&nbsp;can be hard to afford! You tend to take things for granted,&nbsp;being in a rich, great land where the standards of living are high...&nbsp;most of the Filipinos look at us like we're so fortunate just because&nbsp;our lives&nbsp;are so much easier now that we reside in Canada, like we&nbsp;are swimming in money. And&nbsp;most of the time, it's true EXCEPT for the ""swimming in money"" part. That was just me stretching the&nbsp;truth&nbsp;to such an extent like I always do.&nbsp; But going back, there is so much more, I can't even think of what else right now. What I can say is how grateful I&nbsp;truly am for the chance that my family and I had to save up for&nbsp;that trip alone,&nbsp;I must say it was most definitely worth it. Sure, there was that time I fell ill, somehow I knew it was more than a high&nbsp;fever, which FORTUNATELY&nbsp;only lasted&nbsp;that one night.&nbsp;A night I most likely will never forget, whew! Being in an extremely tropical &amp; hot place like Phil. I was not TOO surprised that&nbsp;my body was going to&nbsp;go wacky or abnormal on me lol. Thankfully, it&nbsp;hadn't affected the rest of&nbsp;our trip too much, for I was soon back to good health. To this day, it still puzzles&nbsp;me as to what exactly was it that made me sick... I dwelt more on the fact that it was so unbearably hot there that maybe my body just couldn't take the sudden heat? It still remains to be seen, but could have contributed to that, I'm sure. Heatstroke? Or could it have been the large&nbsp;amounts of food we ate? Every meal felt like we were dining at&nbsp;an&nbsp;All-You-Can-Eat Buffet!&nbsp;Ha ha. I&nbsp;still love and thank&nbsp;Tita Annabelle and Tito Teeny&nbsp;for their generosity and&nbsp;being so hospitable&nbsp;as they opened up their home for us.&nbsp;:')&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></strong>"

I already have her home address, but I want to make sure that my dad or sis Chelle could drive me to her place. We're planning I come over this Saturday. We're both free on that day. I've always wanted to see her home and of course her cute puppy Collon! She's simply adorable, and Kaori sent me pix of her that's how I know how cute she is! hehe I love dogs. When I was pretty young, I used to get frightened of them becoz of their loud barking. And back when we were still living in the Philippines, we used to have neighbors who has 2 dogs that just wouldn't shut up. Ahh it bothered me so much, how they couldn't silence it was really strange. But, yeah, lol crazy experience. I'm surprised, out of all my childhood memories, I got reminded of that. LOL That was so long ago. Like about 9 years or so, I think... so I was still only 7. lol.<BR>&nbsp; And I also asked Christina and see if she would like to come too. She said sure- yessss! lol,&nbsp;yea&nbsp;she also adores dogs- she has 2 dogs btw, so it proves it. lol. I know she'd love to see Collon too. SO, yea, this is going to be real FUN! <BR>&nbsp; In addition to that, I'm also excited to move again. This time move to a better house, where I can have my own room again! Living in Applewood a couple of yrs ago, I did used to have my own room- in the basement! brr, sometimes it got cold.. but meh it was my choice. Turthfully it wasn't so bad, really. hehe. <BR>&nbsp; Well that's all 4 today. I added a whole bunch of entries here. I'm so proud of meself! lol...but i g2g. my family needs me with help on stuff. i'll catch up w/ u l8ers, J. ~Gnite!</FONT> </FONT>"

   These are just a sample of poems that I made a long time ago, I think back when I was still 12 or 13. And I absolutely spent a lot of time writing poems they were my favorite pasttime. Nowadays, I don't write as often as I used to, but nonetheless I still love to write. Especially poems. lol. Now, normally I don't give a title for some poems, either I simply forget to make one up or I don't really care about having a title. But yeah, anyways, here's one, this is a title-less poem, hehe. Hope you enjoy them :) good reading...
 
 My position is bad
 It's absurd - I'm going berserk
 How could I have let it drop 
 And fall fast 
 To the very last
 Bit of droplet
 Hope I'm not buried deep
 I've done my best 
 -or have I?
 Just give it a rest
 Shrug it all off
 Cuz you know that next time
 You will not make
 The same mistake
 Not ever
 No never"

See, journal, now you know, that's how I am when I'm in a baaaaaadd state of frame. But writing here would've cheered me up real quick! Too bad I didn't think of it sooner, and well, I was still drowsy and in no mood to type. Oh well, I am now, and it does make me feel good. You're truly the cure to get rid of nasty grumpiness- ahhh this is my therapy. lol ^^&nbsp;Speaking of therapy,&nbsp;one of the things that made me feel good was&nbsp;I&nbsp;took a shower&nbsp;just a couple of mins ago.

<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just great. I never expected that I would be retracing my thoughts, going in reverse trying to remember what I wrote down earlier. I am such an airhead. It's not Erin this time, it's me. lol.&nbsp; I have learned a mistake that was&nbsp;too quickly made: all documents must first be saved, or copied, BEFORE averting to a different process. Such as clicking to a different link which will undoubtedly erase the document althogether, thus hitting a nerve that shortens your temper down to zero. In other words, after what I did, I realized&nbsp;that this one will be the start of the many stupid things I&nbsp;will do and have yet to do today.&nbsp;The days&nbsp;are rare when I don't do something stupid. But anyways, we'll continue on...</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is very strange to me. So much to think about so little time. I need to figure out what's bothering me. But I don't know what it is yet. I have yet to look deeper inside myself.... something's missing in my life. But I don't know what, that's the only problem right now that seems to be re-surfacing every time I think. I need help. Guidance. From the Lord. If I just get rid of these petty, unnecessary habits, I might actually set my life straight. These habits destroy me, hinder me from a process that once was making progress, now it's discontinued ( no thanks to me, pfft). </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First I must go step by step, and make sure that each step counts for something. One wrong move and I'll spiral down lower and lower. Creating myself a hole, and if I don't put an end to my mistakes I make, it will be too deep to even get myself out of this hole I've unknowingly created for myself. But if I take the right correct steps, I'll get to my destination safely. And the more easier it is for me to see the light, and remove myself from the darkness of the dark in the world.</STRONG> </P>

"event","I have to start this off with: OMG I'M SO HAPPY I FINALLY GOT TO FUCKING SEE HIM!!!

Anyways, I drove home from Dekalb after class on Tuesday, got my oil changed and car washed, and then met up with Shauna and Josh and we went to Woodfield mall. Traffic was terrible and we were starving when we got there so we had some cocktails and dinner at Cheesecake Factory and did a bunch of window shopping. I got some new eyebrow jewelry.

Wednesday I hung around the house. My parents bought a new mattress and boxspring so I can go back to sleeping in my old room when I come home so I got to chill out alone for a bit. Then I went with my parents to take the dog for a walk on the trail and then we did some shopping for my cousin Peter since he turned 31. I can't believe he's so old.

Thursday we got our stuff together and took 2 cars to my aunt's in Cicero since I was going to leave early to see Aaron. I love my family, it was so much fun. Peter dragged out this old album of pictures that I've never seen before...it was mostly pictures of him and me playing together as kids, as in before my sister was born. They were so funny, I was the dorkiest kid. 

I went to Aaron's and when he answered the door I had to hold myself back from jumping on him since his family was over. We behaved ourselves and visited for a while, then went to my house. I missed him sooooooo much. 

Then yesterday I was supposed to work 3-8, but they fucked up and had to cut shifts so I ended up driving all the way back here for a 2 hour shift. Fuck that, it wasn't worth it. But then Aaron came out and we spent the whole night watching tv and movies and we had a pillow fight and we are seriously the geekiest couple in the history of the world. But it was fun.

Now I won't see him til December 15th. The countdown begins."

"event","Conan today was incredible. The wait for it, not so much.

We took the 8am train to the city and checked in and received our official tickets and got in line somewhere around 9:40. We were probably in the first 40 people in line, or thereabouts. It was really cold and drizzling most of the day, but at least the wind wasn't nearly as bad as it was yesterday. The first few hours went by relatively uneventfully since everyone was just sort of chilling out, literally.

You had to have at least one person from your group holding your place in line since it was general admission so Aaron and I took a few turns walking around. I decided to go to Borders to warm up and to get there I had to walk by the Channel 7 ABC studio, which is brand new and has a big window on the street where you can look in on the newsroom. There was a large group of kids yelling 'happy birthday' at the window (I think it was the weather woman's birthday) and the cameras were on them and I walked right into the shot. So basically, I became one of those people that I despise...you know, the ones who walk into the background and wave at the camera and look like they have no idea what's going on. It was great.

Sometime after noon (I couldn't tell you when it was) some people from Pizzeria Uno showed up and set up a table right by us in line. They kept telling us we were getting pizza but they had to wait for some reason, so the best part was when Conan came up himself to greet us and help hand out pizza. Aaron shook his hand as he went by and then nearly died of shock. They were showing clips of it on the news tonight and I'm pretty sure I was in some of the shots.

A million (or maybe two and a half) hours later we were told to walk slowly and follow the line into the theater in an orderly fashion. But the combination of cold, rain, and overall giddiness shot that idea to hell and everyone broke formation and ran for it. Aaron and I ended up right off the center aisle in about the 10th row back...excellent seats.

The show was pretty good. At the end, Conan made the rounds through the theater and I got to talk to him and he signed my ticket. He's such an awesome guy.

There's a ton of stuff I'm missing but I'm sooo tired so I'll probably edit later."

The game itself sucked, but we had fun anyways.

Also, I got a pair of nice running shoes and a pair of dressy shoes at Payless the other night for just about $30. I love Payless.

Today I'm supposed to be off work, but I have a feeling they'll call. And then I'll probably go in. Aaron's got Passover stuff tonight anyways and I have no idea where anyone else is anymore."

About this time, someone is telling you to get on the plane. ""Get on the plane. Get on the plane."" I say, ""FUCK you, I'm getting IN the plane! IN the plane! Let Evil Knievel get ON the plane! I'll be in here with you folks in uniform! There seems to be less WIND in here!"" 

""In the unlikely event... "" This is a very suspect phrase, especially coming, as it does, from an industry that is willing to lie about arrival and departure times. ""In the unlikely event of a sudden change in cabin pressure... "" ROOF FLIES OFF!"" 

The next sentence I hear is full of things that piss me off. ""Before leaving the aircraft, please check around your immediate seating area for any personal belongings you might have brought on board."" Well, let's start with ""immediate seating area."" SEAT! It's a god damn seat! Check around your seat! ""For any personal belongings... "" Well, what other kinds of belongings are there besides personal? PUBLIC belongings? Do these people honestly believe I might be traveling with a fountain I stole from the park? ""... you might have brought on board."" Well... I MIGHT have brought my arrowhead collection! I didn't. SO I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK FOR IT! I'm going to look for things I BROUGHT on board! It would seem to increase the likelihood of my finding something, wouldn't you say? 

Here's one they just made up: ""near miss"". When two planes almost collide, they call it a near miss. It's a near HIT. A collision is a near miss. 

They tell you to locate your nearest emergency exit. I do this immediately!  I locate my nearest emergency exit, and then I plan my route. You have to plan your route. It's not always a straight line, is it? Sometimes there's a really big fat fuck sitting right in front of you. Well, you know you'll never get over him. I look around for women and children, midgets and dwarves, cripples, war widows, paralyzed veterans, people with broken legs, anybody who looks like they can't move too well; the emotionally disturbed come in VERY handy at a time like this. You might have to go out of your way to find these people, but you'll get out of the plane a lot God damn quicker, believe me. I say, ""Let's see... I'll go around the fat fuck... step on the widow's head... push those children out of the way... knock down the paralyzed midget, and get out of the plane where I can help others."" 

I can be of no help to anyone if I'm lying unconscious in the aisle with some big cocksucker standing on my head. I must get out of the plane, go to a nearby farmhouse, have a Dr. Pepper, and call the police."

I have two finals tomorrow and I'm done for the semester. I picked out my speeches tonight. They're actually columns by Jana Thompson who writes for the style section of the paper, and she's hilarious. Somehow I'm relatively certain that I won't be as hilarious, but I'd just like to finish the class and be done. That's the way I do things.

I watched a woman throw a fit over $10 today. It was pretty funny. She was getting a cash refund because she'd paid with cash on an exchange and was returning what she had exchanged for. She was mad that it wasn't going back on her credit card. She was a real bitch too, so I refused to help her. She wasn't my customer to begin with, but I tried to help. Fuck people like that. Nobody likes you.

Aaron's gotten really cuddly lately and I haven't the slightest clue why. Usually it wouldn't bother me...but it's Aaron we're talking about. You just have to know what he's normally like. 

I need to go Christmas shopping. I bought part of my sister's gift a few months ago, and then parts of my friends' gifts a few weeks ago, but that's it. I think I know what I'm getting for Aaron, but I need time to sneak off and go buy it.

This is what happens when you haven't really had a day off from anything in about three weeks. I have so much stuff due and I'm so sick right now. 

I'm preaching to the choir, but I figure I get my five minutes to bitch. Bleh!

And meanwhile, some people are partying as we speak. I don't like them anymore.

I wasn't even expecting to be able to get a parking spot, but the back part of our lot was empty, so that was nice. Then I stepped into the land of the fucking-out-of-their-minds...Yeah, a shitload of people, which I expected. What I didn't expect was for them to be so...nice? I totally lucked in. I did my shit and took off at 2. 

Tonight Aaron and Anthony and I went to see Disturbed and Corrosion of Conformity at the HOB. Soil played too, but I don't count them--they sucked. COC was pretty awesome, didn't really fit in with the Disturbed crowd, but I was impressed. I'll have to check out more of their stuff. Disturbed was ON tonight...awesome fucking show. A little too much talking in between songs for my taste, but the drunk guys next to me made it all worthwhile. 

Of course it had to snow today. Guess whose snow equipment is still in the box from her old car? When we got back, Aaron kindly cleaned off my car. Gotta love him. 

My toes are numb and the nyquil is kicking in. And I have a lot of homework to get done tomorrow before finals. Bleh...school. I'm so not a fan."

Sorry I didn't pick up, Jamie. The cat was sitting on my phone so I didn't hear it ring.

I think I'm going to take the one Spanish class I need next semester and get a full time job (no, like a REAL full time job). Aaron pointed out that they have a career services office at MCC and since I'm a graduate, they have to help me. We'll see what happens. I have to get through Christmas first.

I can't believe it's almost Thanksgiving already. 

I have so much work to get done before finals. I hope I don't have to work again Sunday so I can get some of it done. I wasn't supposed to work tomorrow morning but I picked up a short shift. Then Aaron's coming out to NIU with me so he can get some stuff done with transcripts. He found out yesterday that one of his professors is publishing a study that Aaron was a part of in a science journal and his name will be in it and everything. It's really cool :)"

"event","I realized that I never elaborated on Monday. Or anything of late.

Monday was our anniversary. Aaron got me a giftcard to Borders (since that's where we met) and the Family Guy nighttime Peter and Lois playset (complete with banana). He practically jumped up and down when he opened his King Diamond t-shirt. He took me out for dinner at Outback and we took a side trip to Lovers Lane :P 

I love him so much.

I've had a lot of money issues this year. I don't feel like saying much more about it except that I still can't register for next semester so I'm totally screwed. I might take Spanish since I'm sure to be able to get into one of those classes, and then I'll probably look for a full time better paying job and try to save money again. We'll see what actually ends up happening. I wouldn't mind taking it easier again next semester because this semester has been a bitch and a half and it's not over yet.

My cousin Andy and his wife are adopting a baby from Azerbaijan within the next 3-9 months. It's so exciting for them. They're both doctors but are taking it easy for the next few years so this is the best time. Also, Andy's sister Jennie is getting married in Phoenix in February and apparently my whole family is going to go. I hope it works out, I've never been that far west and we'd all really like to try to take a trip toward the Grand Canyon. Jennie's inviting Aaron too, but I doubt he's ready for a Stone family vacation.

Tomorrow I only have to work from 1-6...it'll be nice. I hate Saturdays lately. Today was like the day after Thanksgiving. All these stupid fuckers didn't have school. I not only had school, but I had a test today too. Bleh. And I had to work. Fuckers."

No, Aaron and I are NOT breaking up. I have to analyze a breakup song for my interpersonal relationships class and I came to the realization a few hours ago that I don't really listen to any emo type breakup music. Suggestions would be appreciated.

I'm going to go pass out now."

I got my car taken in for an oil change, tire rotation, some other small service things, and to take care of a recall repair. All for only $39. Not bad.

My aunt and uncle from Florida took my mom and I out for lunch today. It was nice.

Work was...work. All the halloween stuff went on clearance so all the cheap ass motherfuckers were calling right at 9 to ask what we had left. I told one something to the effect of ""there's stuff. by the time you get here, there will be less stuff."" Customer service my ass. I did wear my cat ears to work though and when I was cleaning the outside windows the mall music system was playing 'Time Warp' so that helped.

I went to school. I hate school.

I came home and helped Aaron answer the door every three seconds. I've never been at someone's house in a busy subdivision or neighborhood with sidewalks on halloween before, sad as that sounds. My parents said three kids came to our house. More candy for me.

Aaron's gift came in the mail today. I'm psyched about giving it to him.

My car needs service work done and I have no idea when I'll get it in. I'm shooting for Thursday. I don't feel like working all day tomorrow. I have three large assignments due Wednesday that I haven't started yet. I really like popcorn. People are already asking me what I'm doing for New Year's and I don't even know what I'm doing next week."

Aaron gets his cast off tomorrow hopefully. It should make a lot of things easier ;)

I'm so bored. I should be doing homework--but I'm not.

After work, Aaron and I went to this awesome tex-mex place we'd never been to in Huntley called Del Toro's...it's really good AND cheap. 

Then we went to Chili's (where Aaron works) to hang out with some of his friends there and watch the Sox game. One of the guys kept buying drinks, so I had too much. And now I'm pretty sobered up and I feel weird because I started watching this game around 7:30 or whenever it started, and it's almost 1am now and it's in the 13th inning and I can't decide if I should stop watching because I have to open in the morning. But then I remember that the opening manager is probably also watching this game, so I probably won't have to rush to work :P

Anyone know what I should get him for our anniversary? I haven't the slightest clue."

Tomorrow I work all afternoon and then close, and then I have to be back to open Wednesday morning. I still have a speech for that class to write. It's going to be interesting.

After our little trip to the emergency room last night, Aaron helped me come up with some schedule options for next semester. I don't register til November 11th, but I wanted to be ready to go. I'm only going to take three classes again though since I'm not ready to move and I'm lazy, but I think I can get a T/TH schedule this time so that'll cut down a LOT on driving. Yeah, I know I should just move out there...but I don't want to. Many reasons.

Aaron's cast is neat. It's black. And he can whack people with it. 

I went to class today, then came back and sat around his house only going out for dinner (Chipotle). So lazy. Yet I'm exhausted. So lazy."

I think I threw out my receipt for my books this semester. Not a problem in that I don't need to return them, but big problem in that I could have mailed it in and been reimbursed for them (being poor is fun!). That's $150 I won't see again. Maybe. Unless I was smart and didn't throw it out. But let's face it--I'm not very smart.

People are stupid.

Aaron wants to go out later. I think it'd be nice to get out, but unfortunately I'm in a really snotty and bitchy mood...so I might go nap that off.

So I'm watching cars go by and blah blah blah. Then I see this kid rollerblade by--pushing a lawnmower. He was wearing a helmet and everything. I thought it was hilarious looking...cause seriously, this kid looked old enough to drive. I have no idea where he was going...my road is one of the worst to walk/ride bikes/push lawnmowers down. Then...there was another kid, also on rollerblades, pushing a lawnmower.

It probably doesn't sound funny now, but it was hilarious then. I need to watch out the window more often.

It was really good...definitely short and kinda crammed together...but hey, it's Tim Burton. You have to be awed. I wore my Jack Skellington sweater as a tribute, but Aaron kept one-upping me with that damn tattoo he has...

Last night's midterm was ridiculous. There were about 12 sections of spanish 101 jammed into Cole 101...we were supposed to be seated by class and a chart was posted in the front, but everyone got jumbled up. Half the group was trashed because they came from the football game. We were sitting so close together that you couldn't help but see other peoples' tests. It was dumb. I have no idea which genius came up with this idea, but I don't think they'll be doing it again. It was beyond lame. I think I did pretty well though, on the up side.

Tomorrow I get to supervise my sister and her friends who are having a birthday party for Briana (my other ""sister""). My parents will be out of town in St Louis for a wedding on Saturday morning...woo. Just my idea of a fun friday night...making sure a group of hormone driven teenage girls don't secretly escape to find boys, or worse, sneak boys into the house. It's a small house...I think I can handle it. I get free pizza out of the deal. I'm a COMPLETE loser.

Aaron's dad once screwed up and called me Bambi (he's really terrible with names...he called Aaron ""Alan"" once too) and the other night he was trying to make light of it at their family thing, and he ended up calling me ""Bimbi"" instead. I can't decide if it's more Bambi or Bimbo..."

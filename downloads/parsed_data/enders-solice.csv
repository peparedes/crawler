Between crossed hearts and
Silent deaths
A kiss in his 'never' or a cupped face
In her 'maybe'
Distance is relative when black and white lines, can be whispered through an ink soaked space
Truth or lies the same
Delivered through imagined lips
Rolled carefully over the tongue
With key strokes
As real as though written on your skin
Words fit like lovers
Painting each 'maybe' as a memory
Her silhouette in his mind
A gift crossing the distance between stars

His hair

To you
She sings
If you could send one memory

One glorious beautiful echo

Reach out and touch
Years like seconds

Against the moonlight
Staring at the small of her back
Hold it tight

I don't really write here anymore, but I found myself wandering through here today and decided to leave another quick fingerprint.

My people are more narrow these days, and that's ok by me...I don't think any of them come here anyway. :) I used to post so regularly, and now nothing. Maybe a couple scattered pieces, peaces...

SO much has changed, while the basics have stayed the same...same bat time and channel in a different life. I am a counselor now, for two years actually...It doesn't pay well, but my souls clean.

Half a decade ago someone gave me a present, accidentally, in a weird hate love kind of way. I was looking at it the other day, and it occurred to me I never said thank you. The circumstances were terrible, and my scars still make my breath catch at times, but the whispered thanks are still present, and louder than the stitched up memories. Been on my mind.

Maybe more, maybe not. Maybe it'll be another year. Junes a weird month in lala land.

Thank You"

"event","I am having bejanxed dreams

I just woke up from a night of fever and dreams. Gryph had a nightmare night as well, so we were similarly bunked, though I doubt his little head was as filled with as many confusing things. As you well know, I don't always dream in imagery I am entirely familiar with. Lots of speculation has gone into this, but the more scientific reason I can come to is: I read more than most people, and I read everything I can find, so it's possible my primate brain is creating images from the words I have read. I have read so much it's almost impossible to remember it all consciously, so the imagery is a mystery. It's also possible I have ANCIENT MUSE POWERS OF DOOM, which allow me to wander your dreams. Paranoid now?

The bulk of last nights stuff is blurry, or too unfamiliar to describe here, but I distinctly remember a male voice saying the following, almost like a narrator.

""No:
he didn't
he wouldn't
he won't

You feel me startle awake, sharp next to you; my arm darts out after retrieving a 9 reflexively, and you find cool gunmetal resting lightly just against your left eye. Immediately, you find yourself shift into the desert at night, that same 9 in your hand, hot there now; it's muzzle is at a similar rest, and you are looking down through a strange adrenaline calm into the remaining eye of a child.""

Then I said aloud: ""Wait, I have had that dream.""

Things went all un-typable from there. *shudders a little* 

I drank Lemon Chello (sp?) before bed... Lemons grown in bottles, dig it."

Fuck all. So I don't sleep a lot, most of you know that already. Usually when I'm up after hours, it is working on homework, or reading. Tonight, I braved the telly. Seriously, when did TV become the absolute cess pit that it is today? I caught this show ""The Girls of Hedsor Hall""; reality tv is Darwinism. Just to clarify, for those of you who, like me, aren't hep to the newest greatest TV invention: These days all you have to do is fail utterly at life, and we will put you on tv to publicly laugh at in droves. Seriously, not just for Springer anymore, now we actually promote people losing at life so we can jeer from over our Swanson chicken and tv trays. It is utterly mesmerizing. Like a train wreck, but HILARIOUS. The entire point of this programming is watching real people suck because they are idiots, and they think that the travesty they are participating in, is success! That is half the fun! Wow. I found myself thinking we were one step away from that episode of Doc Who where when they vote you off, you disintegrate. Here's your future America! Gee, I wonder why the rest of the world hates us?"

Friday i was stupidly late to work.  I called my boss ahead of time to let her know, by a few hours, but when I got there my bosses boss has a sugar drop (diabetic and sorta hard to manage after 4)and then becomes a strange faceless demon who HATES me.  Sok, its passed, she was fine yesterday.  

Started training new guy yesterday.  New guy is a douche.  New guy told me a bunch of stuff yesterday that is classified from the civilian population for a reason.  he also shared with me that he is crazy.  He is also a foot taller than I am, and has a neck larger than my head.  YES!  On the plus side, he is going to take what shifts I say, and not get much in my way, as that he does almost nothing on his own. Even a douche-bag serves a purpose. 

David Died Sunday Morning at 1010.  I got the call before having to leave for a super bowel thing.  I found a full bottle of whiskey that seemed lonely and had a number of comforting things to say.  I am also pretty sure I talked to Liz, Chuck, Boot, Josh, and Ren.  Thanx guys, sorry about the mess.  I am setting the date of the wake, because i am the one who lives across the country, and in my family, the people running this atrocity, didn't know David, really at all.  My dad and i have agreed to go, but I think we plan to get wrecked in a pool bar first.  gonna be good times.  Thank you for going with me Ren.  My father has also suggested I bring some ""Goths, like at your wedding"" because it would have made David laugh as the rest of the family got all squirmy.  I love my pop.  This is fucking him up.  We also considered sending a mime with our proxy written in crayon and asking why there wasn't an open bar so that my Uncle Steven could choke on some irony.  Anyway, I wasn't sure how to post it, so here it is.  I look a lot better than I am, and for that I am pleased.  Hey Liz, I think I'm coming in Thursday the 5th of March, Ill let you or Chuck know the time as soon as I have it.  Oh, and if we could fit in a session at the ink shop, I would be much appreciative...before the burger, k?

It was 65 here yesterday, and snowed all night.  I know how that feels, maybe the weather is having the same week I am.  Mourning is like being bi polar.  

Good News?  My Uncle Jonathan found his Parrot.  My Aunt Helen is being moved to Texas until she dies.  I will visit her, and Texas is pretty; where the sky comes from.  Um, the EFC on my fafsa this year is -0-, and my GPA is probably going to qualify me for a fat scholarship in the fall, at big kid college.  I have hot coffee and sexy shoes.  Everybody dies."

I just sent an email to liz asking her what one wears to a wake.  Is it strange that this is what i am choosing to focus on?  Basic Psyc says no, but it still seems oddly slow motion and surreal to me.  I have decided to wear bright red shoes, but what is appropriate for a wake?  It's not a funeral, and not a party either...You would think a Scot/Irish wake would be a ton of fun, but something tells me that this wont be the case with my family.  This is going to be grey sky brit style, all teary and backwards.  Alcoholics prefer you drink them into the abyss, but I suspect my family will see this as ""Not funny Irony"".  Fuck um if they can't take a joke, right David?  Either way i have made the executive decision to get wrecked on the plane.  Who wants to pick me up, I should be loads of fun by touch down.  It would seem that i am rejecting the five stages of grief and am moving straight into inventing my own in typical me fashion.  ""Why do you always have to be difficult, Joe?""  I don't know, I suppose i just always assumed it was you folks that were wrong."

"event","Cross posted, cuz I remembered.  BUT BE WARNED, its from my myspace, so it's the type of thing i post there...


Lenza asked me today, in the small hours of the morning, ""why do people do horrible things to each other?""  I can see her face in my mind, her eyes forming the question, just as she is seeing my mouth answer it in hers, as she always does, she tells me.  Oh, baby girl, i wish i knew.  Why would a man hold a woman down until pinpricks of blood appear on her skin, blooming fingerprints, while she begs him to stop?  Why would an entire people tear themselves apart from the inside for centuries, without even really remembering why?  Why?  Why is my girl so sad sometimes, why would anyone ever hurt her?  Christ, i don't know.  I'm not even sure i wish i did.  I know I spend a good deal of my time pondering all of these questions:  why the mind is what it is, why men and women are what they are (I think you are all tired of hearing about that) why people believe what they do...culture, relativity, ethics, science.  The question is always why, and the answer is always fear.  That sucks.  Life life life.  Are you sorry?  Am i?  Maybe I said i was sorry for the wrong things...Maybe we all do.  How often are people actually apologetic in a way that can be defined as real remorse, and is symbolic of a commitment not to repeat the offence?  For that we have to truly believe we are wrong.  Not ""I was wrong, but...""  Mitigating circumstances?  Really?  I'm told that some actions cross a line and some don't, some things have acceptable circumstances, some do not.  For fucks sake, how is anyone to tell the difference?  Here, i'll just make a blanket statment to cover all my bases:  I am sorry.  To each one of you i have hurt at some point, i am truly sorry that you were hurt.  I am probably not sorry for what i did.  Sometimes I am sorry for why, but not usually, and I will probably not be changing my behaviour soon, so just take this all to heart now.  I think a lot.  A LOT.  No matter how rash a decision I make may look, I think very quickly, and am quite proficiant in weighing options in an efficiant manner.  Most of the time if I have made a terrible decision, I have made the choice to do so.  If my answer for why is ""I don't know""  I'm not lying, i really don't know why i do some things sometimes, right away, but i do know that i stand behind what i did, and take responsability for it.  Ask me again in a week or so, I may have worked it out.  

Why this blog?  I spent a few hours on the phone this morning with a girl who means volumes to me.  A couple of you have a special pocket of stardust that i keep just for you when you need some light, and dont have any of your own.  she is one of those few.  When my phone rang, it was dark and quiet in the room, and i thought for a split second about a post i wrote for a boy over a year ago called ""Chicks dig scars"".  Funny the things you think about in those moments between waking and dreaming.  Her voice through the line, and the topic of our talk, accentuated the contemplation, and i told her I would pose my process here.  I know it's scattered, what of it, jealous?

I only speak for myself, becasue i only really can.  We all ask the same questions, but the answers vary, moment to moment, and i'm strangely comfortable with it.  I work better in dynamics, anyway.  ooo, theres another interesting fact about myself i analyze too much at times...I really don't do well with complicated.  Now, let me define complicated, because to me it means a myriad of things, and some of them i am good with.  I know, my hippocricy still comes with a costume and six pack of Killians.  I probably mean clingy, but thats a bad phrase too...Hmmmm.  I like being able to turn off my phone when I'm done, and not pay for it with a baragment when i turn it back on.  I don't like being made to feel guilty all the time about everything ever.  This song isn't about you, it frequently isn't so you can quit the chin quivering now.  I like saying what i think, when i think it, no matter how out there it is.  i am dominant, brash, condecending.  I'm not saying I'm proud of it, but I am aware of it, so if anyone thinks that they can shame me out of it, they are in for a disappointment.  I do my very best not to do things that I feel shame over.  I know a few of you are thinking about some of the insane decisions i have made, and shaking your heads, but I had reasons for all of them, even if they were bad ones.  Especially if they were bad ones.  i rarely rethink good decisions, I focus on the bad ones incessantly.  I know, I'm a rock star.  Aight, to rejoin the topic, and make sure it's finishes satisfied...When i say conmplicated, i don't think i mean the literal definition.  I can deal with hoops, and mess, and details...i can deal with obsticles, and crazy circumstance.  To be honest, I engade in a number of complicated activities, just because the complication is part of the fun.  Maybe what i don't like is when....hmmm, how can I express this....I talk to a lot of people about their personal messes and blood.  I am good at it, and i can take almost anything, so it doesn't bother me.  I like helping other people feel their way through things, i don't feel at all.  Like all people, i have my own blood and icky messes.  I deal with them happily, and quietly in my own secret rooms, and i don't require help most of the time.  I come to me too.  Somtimes you see it here, sometimes you don't.  I do not like it when people presume that they should cause some mess for me, by for me, i mean mess that is mine, then scoop it up and pour it all over me, forcing me to process how they want me too, because it's half their ick.  That's what i mean.  that is what i do not like.  I have a couple of people I randomly run things through, and i have my own reasons for that, and it's not super often.  If it's not you, too bad so sad.  Don't cry to me about me, after hitting me and expecting me to like being hit.  I think that is a rule you can hold true to most people.  This just became a ramble, but I think i get it, so whatever, it's not for you.   Oh one more thing.  I don't press these days.  If i ask you whats wrong, it's becasue i know something is, if you arent ready to express, i'm not pushing it, you point at me if you need me, ill still be about.

Anyway, I don't know for sure, baby girl, but my best guess if fear.  I only really know me, and the times I have hurt others with the most brutality, my motivation was fear.  Of course, i think fear is the answer to several big questions, so i may be biased.  For what it's worth, honey, close your eyes now, and think of my mouth and the words i would say, in the tone I would use, with my crooked smile.  People are both monsterous and beautiful every day.  They act out of fear and desire, as often as they do logic.  I love you sincerely, and anything you ever need from me is yours.  When that one thing happens, i'll be holding your hand, and i will always kneecap the monsters for you, no matter where they came from.  You owe me some Gradma soup, made from real grandma's, and some massacred Zuccinni bread.  And remember Sir, chicks really do dig scars."

"event","This is the obligatory end of year blog.
This year a bunch of stuff happened.  I saw my oldest child onto a school bus for the first time.  I learned how to deal with eyeliner.  I maintained a 4.0 in school, made it to size 6 (Thank you Ehel, and Drew), and watched my children grow a whole years worth.  I saw a boy, after a year of fear and waiting with my breath held for letters, come home from Iraq a man.  This year I made a number of choices, every single day; some were mundane, some world changing.  I got an amazing job, changed my hair (thank you Amy), learned to take pictures of myself (thank you Sir), missed my best friend, saw my best friend (thank you Mi), and gave my brother the biggest hug I could find, while getting one as well (Thank you josh).  I forgave, and requested forgiveness; I flew in a plane, and i broke my own heart a couple of times.  I learned even more about life and love, and the nature of men and women, while also recognizing that i might know nothing at all.  Sometimes i just do stuff, and that's going to have to be ok.  I remain myself, intact, and in my heart of hearts, I regret nothing."

"event","Life and death of the human animal is an outrageously controversial subject, for mostly irrational reasons.  Topics such as Abortion, Euthanasia, and Capital Punishment will most assuredly bring heated debate to any table, mostly because of a fear of mortality, rather than any kind of valid or sound argument for, or against.  In this presentation, I will narrow down the each of these topics to show the actual bones they contain, as well as unmasking the real issue behind them all: fear.

The arguments surrounding capital punishment crack me up.  To briefly fine point the most popular arguments against, they are loosely as follows:  The justice system is racially, and sexually biased; the justice system is flawed, and the death of innocent men, is the result; killing is wrong, so killing people to teach that killing wrong is crazy talk.  The first two oppositions can be addressed really easily, and in the same way.

Determining whether or not an action is ethical cannot be based on the current judicial systems accuracy, or biases.  Universal morality is theoretically timeless; what is ok today will be ok tomorrow.  Human laws from place to place will change, and have changed many times over, depending on the current social acceptability climate.  Therefore, the possibility of discrimination or punishment of innocents, is not part of the morality of capital punishment, those issues are part of an entirely different picture.  The issue with capital punishment is whether or not it is morally just the kill those who kill.

The third opposition stands alone within the issue.  If we assume that killing is always wrong, then it stands that capital punishment is wrong, because it is killing.  When we debate topics with relevance to the ethical morality, the point that morality is not based on the current laws is often lost amongst the red faces, and adamant stances.  If it is agreed that killing is always wrong, then we must accept that there are not exceptions to the rule; always makes it superlative.  I do not accept this, and suggest that there are exceptions to the rule such as self defense.  If there are exceptions, then the door is opened wide for capital punishment to be one of those exceptions.  

Capital punishment itself, in the United States of America, is the controlled killing of someone who has been convicted one of the following: a number of different kinds of murder, espionage, treason, genocide, or kidnapping during a bank robbery.  The basic reason maintained for the death penalty is deterrent of future killers, because the risk of mortality is too great, IE rule through fear.  The other most popular belief about the death penalty is that if you kill really bad people, they won't be around to be really bad anymore, and if you just keep them around imprisoned, you have to keep wasting resources on them, like food, and oil, IE ruling to save money, through fear.    Regardless of what you have heard on the television, no study has ever shown empirical evidence that capital punishment works as a deterrent for other would be offenders.  Instead, it has been consistently shown that people with the moral flexibility and inclination to commit these crimes, do not fear repercussion from authorities, as much as they are motivated to commit the offences.  If the threat of death is not a deterrent for offence, then the possibility of repeat offence with opportunity is suspected to be high.  Killing people that we believe will kill again stops them from killing again, makes the victims feel revenge has been served, and keeps the public feeling safe and warm in their homes.  In effect this is the only tangible outcome.  It has been argued that the death penalty is a punishment, but in order for a punishment to be effective the punished must learn something, which is impossible when death is the outcome.  What it actually becomes is propaganda for the masses, rather than deterrent for the few who have the potential for atrocious violence, espionage, treason, genocide, or kidnapping during a bank robbery.  What capital punishment does do, in theory, is absolutely stop people who have committed these crimes, from ever committing them again.  Is that good?  Yes.  Is it morally just?  Eh, it isn't morally unjust, which lends to the idea that it must be right.  I don't feel it is an issue of morality, as presented, but one of society.  As best I can present it as just, is abstractly:  If killing in self defense is just, then killing in defense of the society, as self, is just.

The issue with Euthanasia is whether or not it is morally just to kill those who are medically in viable, or simply ready to die as the result of age or illness/disability.  I think this one should be more about the morality of suicide in any capacity; however because of doctor assistance, this issue becomes more complicated.  I will simplify it by stating that any person who is absolutely done living, for whatever reason, has the ability, and obligation to make their own choices when it comes to their life and death.  Requesting that another's hand wield the weapon of your suicide is a cheap cop out, in any situation.  With that out of the way, I pose that the owner of any object is entitled to keep it as he or she wishes.  I maintain that each mentally capable individual owns their own life, and therefore the destruction or end to that life is within that entitlement, and not unjust, regardless of reason.  Does that suck for the people who have made an emotional investment in the individual?  Absolutely, but sucking doesn't make something immoral.  On a limb, I even go so far as to suggest that forcing someone to stay alive in a condition that is abjectly miserable for them, just to make yourself feel better, is unjust, rather than allowing them to make their own choice to die.

The issue with abortion is whether or not it is morally just to kill offspring while in utero. This issue becomes complicated by people who want to nitpick the intricacies of when a pregnancy becomes a separate person with an inborn right to be alive.  This then springs the arguments about who owns individual lives, and if that is even a definable thing with which laws can be imposed.  Can a baby be murdered if it is still part of the woman's body?  Infanticide is clearly frowned upon, so how is a baby different one day, in the womb, and then a person, the next, after birth?  It isn't really.  The definer between person and non person, with regard to the human animal, is sentience, and awareness.  No one seems to have a bead on when that light bulb appears, so for this argument, let's assume life starts at conception.  Quite a bit of this argument echoes the sentiment behind Euthanasia: ownership of life, and inherent right to life.  The difference between abortion and suicide is that suicide is a choice made by an individual person responsible for the ownership of their life, whereas abortion is the termination of a life without possible consultation of the hypothetical owner of that life.  It has been argued that children do not own their lives because they are not responsible for their actions until they reach a certain age, and that the unborn are even less entitled to ownership because they lack the ability to prove consciousness in the first place.  Do animals have a ""right"" to life that can be taken away by abortion?  No.  Life isn't a right, it is a fact.  Being alive, or not, is a state of being, not a right that can be bestowed, or revoked by a specific individual.  Being alive is a precursor for being dead, no matter when or how that death occurs, and while the loss of life, in any form, is sad for someone, without the presence of malicious intent, ethical morality is hard pressed to nose into those issues too far.  

The reason all of these issues become universally complicated, is fear.  Fear of retribution, fear of a conceptual deity, fear of one's own morality:  Fear.  Death in any facet tends to provoke a fear response in animals, and we are no different.  As a species we, more often than not, abhor and condemn the things that we fear the most, and mortality is the thing that the majority fears the most.  At the bottom line, death is part of life, and either that is an accepted fact, or it isn't.  Terrible, painful, beautiful, monstrous: Life.  In order to bring morality too far into the equation, malicious intent must be present.  When laid bare, moralities exceptions, and rules come down to: actus reus; mens rea; and the ever present fear the follows the blood to the brain."

Now, there are a LOT of cities in the entire country, in case the perspective was lost on some folk.  But we have dropped from 3 to 14 to 29.  I feel so much safer now.  And also like the security guard should be walking me to my car when I walk through the parking lot in the dark at 10 at night.  Fortunatley there has only been several murder on campus this year.  Rather than a few several.  *sigh*  Maybe it's less dangerous because there are less people after all the FUCKING MURDERS each week.

Do my classmates not know how to read?

On a similar topic, but with less sarcasm, I finished my Lit midterm yesterday.  13 pages written for thsat paper.  I better get a million percent.  I want a parade, and lutes to serenade me.

My honors induction is next week.

I need to get a bumper stick for my car that says ""I anger easily, and am FUCKING crazy, dig?""  Seriously, playing road games with me at 80 miles an hour is never going to go well for you.  Swearing makes everything better.

Field may or may not happen next week, the army will continue to suck, and I won't be working Saturday.  I am assured a good time Friday night once all of the children are strapped down, per partying out with the girls.  Wheee!

New ink guy is the awesome.  No scabs.  NONE.  So awesome.  So yeah, I need a nap.  Also, for the elephant in the room to dissapate.  I miss how the light fell in the room without it.  Out."

"event","Look mommy, I crossposted two days in a row!


This morning I drove to work at O'Phuque:15, and on my way I discovered a number of marvelous things.  There are a lot of fucking people on the road that early.  They all think they want a gallon of coffee mainlined to them from a drive thru, as much as I do, but my reckless driving has taught a valuable lesson about fucking with a chick that drives with her eyes closed while smoking two cigarettes.  I am pretty sure shouting ""I will fucking eat you!  Do something!"" out my window, added punctuation to the entire experience, for everyone.  I also noticed that ANYONE can buy a bumper sticker that says ""Smell My Face"".  The human animal will never stop being funny.  

Let's see, wot else?  Chesterfield cops also drive 94 miles an hour on I295 at this hour, so it is perfectly valid to answer the one giving you the stink eye with ""bitch please"".  It's been a fun morning.  Seriously, everything is way more funny than normal.  

Day two as Shoeless Joe Jackson, is going well.  It is quite cold this week, so that's an adventure, and I must wear my pants rolled up, rocking it 1985 style, so that they wont rub the top of my foot.  My voice has not returned, so I sound like a sober Janis Joplin, if her range was lower.  Hudson says it's sexy, but it's possible he just misses me.  I think I sound like A prepubescent boy that has been smoking since he was 2, sucking a bottle of jack, while singing black metal in finland.  

Not much on the sched today at work, so I'm dicking off and surfing the interwebs.  The rest of you are sleeping, because you suck.

I just took a call.  

ME:  Thank you for calling Old Dominion University, my name is Joe, How can I help you?

Moron:  I was trying to reach Virginia State University.

ME:  *blinks*

Moron:  So...I was trying to reach VSU?

Me:  I'm not sure rephrasing the statement will change the outcome of this call, but I can check if you like?

Moron:  *Blinks*  Ok.

Me:  Nope, I just rechecked the letterhead, and this is still Old Dominion.  Anything else I can help you with?

Moron:  I am trying to reach Virginia State.

Me:  OK.  What can I help you with?

Moron:  Is this Virginia State?

Me:  Yep, evidently you had to ask three times in order for me to get it.  What can i help you with?

Moron:  Well I was wondering if you can look up my transcript and tell me where I am at with graduation?

Me:  Sure thing sir, one moment.   

Moron:  Hmmmm  mmmmm.  *Chew chew chew, spit.  Sigh*

Me:  Thank you for holding sir.  I show that that will never be happening.  Have a nice day.  *click.*

*raises brows*  It's like tech support all over again.  I am almost positive there is a reason, I stopped dealing with end users.  Wow.  ""The internets broke!  You broke it, fix it.""  Really, the entire internet?  yeah.  Special folks, loves, they are running for office, and serving you fries with your illusions.  AWESOME."

"event","OK, so at the request of a few cats back home, that don't actually see me ever, I have created an album on my myspace which has pics of my ink work, new and olf.  Now, they aren't great pics, and you know how I hate being pictured in the first place, but I conceded, because I was hornschwaggled (Word?  Jesse?) by several clever people, and the promise of shiny prizes.  *sigh*  The End.

In other news, I had a really strange day.  In addition to having a martian death flu, I was offered a demo cd by a drummer, AND the band doesn't suck; I got to call several people morons, always fun; I remembered to cross post; spelled every fourth word wrong; had to define ""atheist"" for an old person (went super well); AND was noticed more today for being barefooted, than the layer of ink I possess, or the piercings, in my face.  See, oddities abound.

Quote for the day is as follows ""Scratch a cynic and you'll find a disappointed romantic"" ~Moore, Lust Monster of Melancholy Cove  

There was another good quote today, but the word ""Pooter"" was in it, and not in a flattering way, so while *I* laughed my ass off, I am pretty sure, this isn't the crowd."

A few days ago, I wrote a post for ethics, and it has prompted several discussion since, about the nature of people.  Now, understand, that ""posts"" are forum style, so everyone has access to all posts, and I always post last becasue I schedule 36 hours of stuff in every 24 hour period, so I click the submit button at about 2359 Sunday night each week.  Cuz I Rock.  The topic was abortion, with regard to morality, but for me it ended up being more definitions, hipocrisy, and the human tendency to make crap up, then stand stanchly by that crap when they are uncomfortable, or confused by their actual assements.  Here is the post:

I have read most of the posts preceding this, as well as the literature pertaining to it, and I think the main points that keep striking me are: the espousal of rights, and the hypocrisy of using shocking words, such as murder, and then atoning that murder, if rape is involved. 

To address the issue of ""rights"": Life is not a right, it is a fact. If it were a right, or an entitlement, it would have to be granted by someone, or something. If this were the case, the closest association that can be made, is that the maker of the life, is the one who grants the right to it. If this is true, then your parents have the right to your life to give or take at will. This is not conceivably true. The state of being alive, or not, is a fact; whether or not that life is sustained, or happy, or sad, or full of misery and pain, is not a right to be given or taken. The term ""basic human rights"" is a concept, and abstract at that, no matter how commonly it falls out of the mouths of the many. 

In regard to the murder business: If we assume that abortion is the murder of a child, at the point that cells begin to reproduce, then we must equate it with any murder. The end of a life is not better or worse depending on the suffering of someone else. Claiming that murdering a baby is bad, yet somehow less bad if the mother of the child is raped first, is hypocrisy. An example given is that the child would always remind the mother of the rape, and so murder is ok, when in other circumstances murder would not be ok. By that standard, it would be ok to murder a five year old child, if their presence was suddenly associated with a brutal act; both inflicted, and felt other people. Nitpicking semantics, does not lessen, or worsen the states of life and death. Whichever side you choose, I suggest that you be consistent with your choices, or at least admit the irrationality behind them, and try to question and analyze why it exists. 

In regards to my own personal opinion: I do not suggest that I have personally found a system of universal morality that works for any subject, though I am certainly always on the lookout for one. In matters of life and death, I make only my own choices, and do not presume to make them for others, or judge them in matters I do not fully understand myself. In the animal kingdom, death is as common as life. Whether it is the death of our young, or not: it is the natural progression. Admitting that it sucks emotionally doesn't change that, and it never will. 

I personally choose not to have abortions. I also admit that my reasons are not logical ones, but they are mine, and for me that is good enough for now.

J Marshall

Now, I get to take a few minutes, and re-read my process, to analyze my ish.  This myspace post, is not about abortions, by the way, I don't care how any of you feel about them.  Or murder, for that matter.  The reason I am dwelling, is I feel like I am on the edge of an epiphany, and I worry that human actions, and reactions are still going to come down to fear, at the bottom line, as usual, regardless of this epiphany.  Maybe, thats's the epiphany, in itself, neh?

OH, and we have a new reader, who I don't actually know at all, as far as I can tell, and the clever girl is a private user, so I can't even snoop in to check.  SO, my standard disclaimer bears repeating, if she is even still reading.  Are any of you still here...well, other than you of course.

DISCLAIMER:

This blog is not here for me to update folks I know with the stuff I do.  It does serve at that from time to time, but that is mostly accidental.  I use this blog as a running commentary of my own internal monolouge.  I do not edit it for content, or spelling, or other peoples feelings.  I am aware that people read it (18,757 hits in 2.5 years, to be precise) and that is fantastic.  Hilarious, but fantastic.  However I do not write it for them.  Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes it doesn't.  I have days where I dont put on pants or use punctuation, so there's, that.  I believe everyone is a liar, and refer to it often.  By everyone, I mean EVERYONE.  Especially me, Good writers are the very best liars, and my morality, as well as my perceptions have the potential to be flexible, depending on the topic.  I try not to lie to people I love, but I only really love a handful of people I didn't make myself.  I am facinated by the relationship between men and women.  I refer to it often.  It does not always reflect my own life.  Do not send me crazed emails wondering if I have taken a blade to my skin over some imaginary tradgedy.  I didn't.  My personal wars and demons may be carefully sleeping between the lines at times, but never assume you found them.  Um, yeah.  I think that covers everything I feel like covering.  Feel free to comment if you want to discuss something I write.  I don't care what you think, but I love debate, if you are sharp enough to back it up.  Also, I like cupcakes, and the word fuck."

Everything seems to have gone to shit.
I can't really get over on what has happened in the past 365 days.
The only positive is that I found out who my friends are, and there aren't that many.
I am gonna be a senior next year.
It's hard to believe.
And kinda scary.
I hope I can graduate early since I am going to FAHS.
But you never know.
All I know is that I want to get this as a tat:

It's so pretty.


Well, see you in a year I guess."

"event","Soooo everything is fine now.
Zach picked me up today and Nicci and Lee were in the car.
We drove to Oasis to get cigs and then we went to Target to visit Rachel on her break.
Then Zach dropped us off at my place and we watched South Park and ate chips.
40 mins later Zach picks us up and we go to Flaherty's and we played a round of DDR.
After DDR Zach and Nicci got glued to the Megatouch so Lee and I sat outside Mcdonalds having a cig and talking.
Zach called me and said ""Where are you? We are going to Target to pick up Rachel"".
We picked her up and decided that we didn't want to go back to Flaherty's so we were driving around Ghetto of St. Paul playing Padiddle (A game where if you see any light out in the car your supposed to scream ""Padiddle"" and touch the ceiling of the car. The last one to touch the ceiling has to remove and article of clothing.) I only had to remove my socks and my sweatshirt. I refused to take off my shirt since I was sitting in the front seat. But Nicci had to take off her shirt and Lee took off her shirt and pants. Rachel only had to take off her jacket. Zach was gonna take off his pants before his shirt but he was to scared... Besides nobody wants to see that he is like my brother. D: And so a guy drove by and he was following us then he was nodding and he pulled further ahead of us and was flashing lights at us. We think he wanted us to follow him but he look old and scary so we didn't. Then we pulled over and had a cig in central park. Lee was just in her underwear so she wrapped herself in the blanket from the backseat. Then we realized we weren't supposed to be in the park after dark. So if a cop came over we would be fucked. So Zach drove everyone home.
So here I am.

"event","New years was absolutely amazing.
I went to Sophie's for her New Years/Birthday gathering.
It was Tim, Zach, Ashlee, Sophie and I.
And her mom of course.
She got us Beer and UV.
Zach brough his Vanilla Schnapps that I got him for his birthday and a little bit of Bacardi Razz.
Tim brought a bottle of this gross bloody mary shit.
It was really disgusting.
We started drinking at 9:32 because that's when sophie was born.
We all, including Sophie's mom had a shot of UV.
At midnight we stumbled out onto Sophie's deck and screamed to the neighborhood ""Happy fucking 2007, Betch!""
God. I have never been so drunk. Erica and Airik appeared out of nowhere and said Hi, took 2 beers then left. Zach dared me and Ashlee to makeout and I was like ""I not drunk enough, grab me a beer."" But I guess her mom decided that we had enough so she hid the beer. And Zach couldn't find his Razz and he was really sad. So we just ended up watching Matilda. In the middle of the movie tho I stood up and walked over to Sophie's toilet and threw up this Cheese and Cracker stuff my mom made me bring. I hate throwing up sooo much. Ashlee and I dared Zach to roll around in the snow in the middle of the street. He almost got runover by a snowplow. xD We fell asleep at about 6am. I had such a fucking hangover. We went over to Zachs after we ate at Taco Bell and I was trying to fall asleep watching The Craft. Then we played Guitar Hero and my mom picked up me and Ashlee and we drove her home and I fell asleep.

But tomorrow i'll go to Flarehty's and then one Saturday I'll probably go meet up with TWY and take pictures for myspace. See I am in this band called The Wasted Youth (TWY for short) and i am the drummer. The thing is I am the only girl and it's a rap band. I am not much of a fan of rap but i guess it would be fine. We'll see how far we get....

life sucks :[
.............................

Is it still me that makes you sweat? 
Am i who you think about in bed? 
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking as you're sliding off your dress? 
Then think of what you did. And how I hope to God it was worth it. 
When the lights are dim and your heart is racing as you're fingers touch your skin. 
I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch...a better fuck 
than any boy you'll ever meet. Sweetie you had me. 
Girl I was it look past the sweat, a better love deserving of 
exchanging body heat in the passenger seat. no no no you know it will always just be me 
Let's get these teen hearts beating. Faster faster! 
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls 
will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close 
So I guess we're back to us, so cameraman, swing the focus! 
In case I lost my train of thought where was it that we last left off ? 
lets pick up pick up 
Oh now I do recall, we just were getting to the part... 
Where the shock sets in, and the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick. 
I hope you didn't expect to get all of the attention. 
lets not get selfish, did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus? 
Let's get these teen hearts beating. Faster faster! 
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close 
Dance to this beat
Dance to this beat 
Dance to this beat 
Lets get these teen hearts beating faster faster

1975 - Sean Maher who plays Simon on <i>Firefly</i>
1965 - Martin Lawrence, you know....
1952 - Billy West the voice of Fry on Futurama, Stimpy on Ren and Stimpy and Doug in Doug to name a few
 
The only really intresting thing that happened on my birthday is that in 1178 BC a solar eclipse may have marked the return of Odysseus to his kingdom after the Trojan war.
Oh and in 1943 Dr. Albert Hofmann discovered the psychedelic effects of LSD.

"event","01) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.

02) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.

03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.

04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.

05) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.

06) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.

07) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.

08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.

09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.

10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.

then there is the tremont which is only half a mile away and is 132 a night with 1 queen bed and a sofa bed.  i think this one is a keeper!  it even has a kitchen.  then we have the radisson which is the closest, a whopping .17 miles away.  but the web site says that sat night is sold out.  so we could do what we did last time, which is a pain in the ass and do two hotels.  and theres always the possibibity that we could just move rooms, someone might cancle, or not show. but the radisson is 148 a night, or 132 with a military id, i think. anyways ill figure this out later i gotta go to work now."

totaly unrelated to that:
my dads in the hospital cuz his heart hurts him.  acually im kinda happy about this, i hope it will serve as a wake up call for my dad to take life easy and quit sweating the small shit like he tends to.  so tomorrow theyr gonna do some stress tests ( which will come out with him being extreamly stressed) and other shit to make sure his heart wont up and quit on him anytime soon.
lol he called eariler to say that theyr moving him to another hospital in hope of catching mom before she left (failed) , and all he could say was how much time he wasted in the hospital today.  he truly deeply despises being in hospitals.  who does tho? cant vouch for everyone but id say most dont.  
ha my mom asked if i was gonna go to work tomorrow and i was like wtf?  'well your father is in the hospital i think that is a good reason to get off work'  im quite tempted to use it.  work at <s>hell</s> ikea for 4 fucking hours and make 30 bucks... or see movie with alex?  hmm i gotta think that over.
'hi this is stevie calling to say that i wont be coming in today because my father is in the hospital and im going to visit him ::cough cough::'  
truly im a terrible daughter

then id get me a horse or two, a coup of chickens! a few cats and ferrets, and of course a dog.  gotta have someone to protect me.  live out my life in solitude."

"event","Dear Ms Dillard:

      Thank you for contacting me regarding the issue of marriage and a
Marriage Amendment to the Constitution.  I appreciate your concerns 
and want my position to be very clear.

      On July 14, 2004, I voted with 47 other Senators to bring a 
Marriage Amendment to the Constitution up for a vote on the Senate Floor but, 
the majority of Senators did not support bringing this Amendment to a
vote. Sadly, this kind of obstructionism has prevented confirmation 
of judges and recorded votes on many of our nation's most important 
issues. I believe the people have a right to know exactly where their elected
officials stand.

      I do support a Marriage Amendment to the Constitution because I
believe that recent events and future court decisions indicate that a
constitutional amendment is needed to protect the traditional 
definition of marriage.

      While I respect your position on this controversial issue, I'd 
like to point out that this Amendment did not seek to define or deny any 
power held by state legislatures to create civil union statutes and any 
benefits that may apply.  It was specific only to the definition of traditional
marriage and therefore State legislators would remain free to define 
civil unions without the courts forcing definitions upon them.

      On a personal note, I have always believed that individuals 
should be treated with dignity and it is my heartfelt hope that everyone 
associated with the discussion of this issue will show each other that respect.

      Thank you again for taking the time to contact me.  If you would 
like to receive an e-mail newsletter about my initiatives to improve 
America, please sign up on my website (http://allen.senate.gov).  It is an 
honor to serve you in the United States Senate, and I look forward to working 
with you to make Virginia and America a better place to live, learn, work 
and raise a family.

      With warm regards, I remain

Sincerely,

Senator George Allen

i know thats a standard response, still didnt say if the state planned to adopt civil unions, which is what i asked.  ::sigh:: gonna send another letter worded differently to see if i can get more infomation."

"event","Marvel Warrior lowered the power in his jetboots and backpack stabilizers as he came to rest at the hospital's base.  The street was a ruined mess of rubble but the hospital was pretty well untouched.  As turned off his powered suit light flashed in the corner of his eye, and ice claimed his left arm.  Wildcat shivered in his grip. ""What the...?"" Marvel pondered surprized. Someone in a green outfit and cape jumped before him w/ a saber made of fire. ""Walker?"" Marvel recognized the Torch. Walker's eyes widened as he recognized Marvel Warrior.  ""Oh crap...Icey Wait!"" Walker gestured behind Marvel. Marvel turned his head and saw the young Sea Collosus levitating toward him quickly from behind a large chunk of rubble. Thankfully she paused. Marvel had tusseled w/ Sea Collosus' before, they were superstrong and savage fighters.  He had foolishly depowered his suit too soon, the armor's early warning systems could have warned him. Stupid.  Luckilly they were Torches....this time.
        
       Walker looked to Marvel's charge, ""Is Wildcat ok?"" Marvel turned his suit's power back on and flexed breaking the ice that held his arm. ""He will be. Bumped his head trying to lick his nuts, I think."" Walker rubbed his chin, ""If we put him in the hosital someone might flip up his mask and learn his secret identity."" Marvel and Walker were equally sensitive about protecting their secret identities,for their own reasons. Walker epiphaned, ""We could put Wildcat in an ambulance..under guard so no one can get at him.""  Marvel liked that idea and made it so. Marvel being something of an EMT in his 'civilian' life made sure Wildcat was fine. Walker cast a low level heal to make sure Wildcat's injuries were stabilized, and then energy coccoon which covered Wildcat in a forcefield.  It was a weak forcefield but it'd stop snoops from flipping up the vigilante's mask up.  
      Marvel detected 2 bogeys coming in. His sensors detected Tech Force freqs being emitted.  All Tech Force members wore special equipment so they wouldn't set off defenses at Tech Force base.  Occasionally it came in handy in the field like a locator. It turned out the 2 bogeys were really four, Robo-Chaquita (or RC)carried Cairn and Pyre carried Nuke. Icey greeted the Tech Forcers as they landed.  
    With Doc Armstrong dead, killed by the Conk it was unclear who would lead them now. Only Pyre and RC didn't really qualify to lead. Pyre was too young and inexperienced and RC was a cybernetic organism based on a design created by the Conk's twin brother. Basically she was too young and inexperienced also. Nuke had lead, Cairn had lead, and Marvel had lead.  The problem. No one really wanted to. Walker and Marvel rejoined the rest of Tech Force and Icey.  
       ""Youse Torches got it handeled here...we got folks to save and robots to recycle!"" Cairn spat. Icey shook her head, Cairn was a legend in the super biz but she disagreed. Walker asked to be caught up. Nuke filled him in, ""Us 5 can do more good than you 2. You 2 should stay here and guard the hospital, while we go fight for the city.""  Walker felt inclined to agree but felt Gate's summons. He and Icey squinted as they recieved the message, to the Tech Forcers it appeared the Torches were suddenly glaring at them.  This did nothing to endear these Torches to Cairn.  ""Got a staring problem Betty?"" Cairn challenged Icey saying. She opened her eyes fully surprized. She had no idea she'd been staring, but now a super biz legend was threatening her. 
   Walker spoke up, ""Listen you guys...you're right but Gate needs us. The Torches are regrouping. Help us....Please?"" Nuke felt inclined to agree. ""Cairn why don't you, and Marvel go w/ them. RC, Pyre and I can stay here?  You guys back up the Torches, and we'll guard the hospital-front?"" Nuke knew Cairn sought action more than he or Pyre did. Cairn put a massive rocky paw to the back of his head considering, it wasn't a bad idea and sure beat playing 'rock, paper, scissor' here.  ""Ok now dats a plan!"" Since all agreed Marvel scooped up Cairn, and together w/ the pair of Torches flew off to where Gate was.

        Gate and Blurr stood over the knocked out forms of Justice and Magna.  It almost looked like they were sleeping. Many had alluded that Magna and Justice were sleeping together but no one dared ask, and Justice wasn't telling.  A small portal opened in the sky near Gate and Blurr. Blurr moved to be in a better position to defend the fallen Torches if something evil hopped through. After tense seconds out flew 3 forms familiar to Blurr and Gate. Triad, Starshot, and Suspender.
    Triad and Justice shared leading the Torches off and on. Starshot was the first Torch and Torch leader.  Suspender was a fun-loving cyborg who was one of the first 5 Torches. All had immense amounts of experience, having seen and done it all. 
       Gate began to feel better already, and Blurr calmed.  He even zipped up to Triad and company as they landed to greet them. Soon Dahlia flew over a tall building carrying Omus in a compromising position. Omus carried the limp form of Quint. As they lighted, Omus placed Quint beside Justice and Magna.  Triad began CPR and resuscitation techniques. Omus and Dahlia had not recieved such training yet. Quint began waking in no time.  In fact the worst damage he had seemed to take was to his hand. Omus was sporting some burns himself but acted fine. Dahlia looked clean and refreshed. Spirit and Sentient flew up carrying Bludgeon and Harry ran up Guardian-less. Walker, Icey, Marvel, and Cairn were the last to show up. ""Hail, hail the gangs all here,"" Cairn blurted dejectedly. Marvel noted the rocky fellow wasn't the same since Doc died. 
      Gate stirred Magna and Justice unconcious minds.  It was painful but it would wake them if they weren't in a coma.  Justice woke gasping as if he couldn't breath, and Magna just sat up holding her forehead.  Now, truelly the gang was all here."

"event","...Communications had been out for a few hours now.  Telegraphs still worked, as did short wave radios. The messages Shiva was recieving were disturbing but so far they were only effecting America, Southern Europe, Atlantis and supposedly Haven, Africa. The large red skinned mutant couldn't imagine any sane being attacking Haven.  Paradigm was there.  Besides that  all of Haven's citizens were superpowered beings. It seemed an extremely arrogant move, or and immature one. They couldn't get a good enough communication through to figure it out yet.  He was almost tempted to send one of his fast movers...maybe Bolt or Quantum tocheck it out.  Quantum had a very good reputation in England, and Bolt was...well Bolt was still abrely welcome in America. Both fast movers could fly about as fast anything could in Earth's atmosphere. Both were extremely powerful so would be able to handle most situations they might run into. Shiva sensed a lifeforce arrive outside his tent.  The Russians were preparing to invade Poland in an attempt to preemptively weaken the Conquistador as well. His army was amassed along the Polish border. Every platoon had one or 2 super heroes from the Super Soldiers to accompany, lead, or back up respectively. Shiva was the leader and one of the more powerful members of the team. He was the only SPB w/ his platoon.  The lifeforce outside his tent had just appeared, and was conversing w/ his guard...and had a very bad accent. Shiva rose from his seat to....see the guard fly into his tent.  Or rather a bloody mess that had been his guard. A enormous, shirtless Jamaican man w/ long dreadloks, walked in and said something to Shiva he didn't understand. Shiva didn't have time to question the invader.


To the troops outside the tent of Shiva the next 23 minutes were a nightmare none had ever dreampt of. An explosion in SHiva's tent was followed by a portal had opened in the sky and flying alien men and women had come out to destroy Shiva's fortifications. The flyer zipped around at superhuman speeds, using martial arts even the Spetznatz in the ranks couldn't counter. The few that lived were the few that ran.

Shiva awoke 35 minutes later in Poland.  He knew it was Poland.  The Conquistador's cyber-troopers were stalking through the snow toward him. He knew their tread.  They were as silent as dumptrucks. It took a few moments to remember what had happened. A Jamaican man dressed in yellow martial arts pants had entered his tent, squawked something, opened his hand toward Shiva...and..Shiva was now in Poland."

"event",".....it came to pass. An epic portal opened over the city of Salvation, in the country renamed Haven.  Paradigm, Enigma, Overthrow, and the city's militia stood by.  After Enigma's last prediction, no one doubted him.  Half the militia was volunteers so terrible was the threat suggested by Enigma. Former super villains stood w/ former superheroes, side by side to protect their home. Enigma looked down the lines of citizen warriors. He saw Bowsmen and Flak.  Both were captains in Paradigm's militia. What had seeing them meant in Enigma's vision?  He hadn't deciphered that yet. The portal roared to white life like it's predessesors. But then came a new sound. A bass roar. A monstrous roar.  The roar of thousands, maybe millions. Paradigm looked unphased. His top aides and captains shared his stoneface. Many former villains, and 'just citizen' types didn't. Several former villains looked ready to split.  A few did.  Paradigm looked to the defenders of Salvation and shouted over the din,  ""Let them come!  We fear no menace.  Haven is protected by a force greater than the gods!"" Many thought Paradigm was referring to himself. Those who actually knew the leader knew his greatest confidence lay in his people.  His people were mutants, mutates, and sort of humanoid who sought peace and a place to belong away from the judgement of 'normal' humans. Paradigm turned back the direction of the portal.  From it's white light flew hundreds of flying warriors. Paradigm raised a magnetic forcefield suspecting an aerial bombardment. He was not let down.  Most of the flyers unleashed torrents of pure power.  Whereas Paradigm and most mutants used the power within themselves to manipulate a force or their form, these warriors were blasting it and using it fly. Paradigm's forcefield held. Overthrow put his hand on his master's shoulder, Paradigm squinted to him and nodded.  Overthrow was a young mutant, barely 20 but had proven himself nearly a thousand-fold by Paradigm's side.  Overthrow was a superhumanly strong mutant, w/ the power of flight, plasma blasts, extreme durability, and weak telepathy. Using his telepathy to boost the gain of his voice to the crowd Overthrow shouted, ""Flyers!""  He knew by habit that Paradigm would allow his flyers to go through but no blasts from their foes. Overthrow often marveled at the level of skill Paradigm wielded his power. Paradigm was also superhumanly strong, magnikinetic, who also wielded plasma.  Besides his massive power Paradigm was an able warrior and leader, and one of the foremost minds of Earth. 
  Without a doubt those warrior citizens who could fly, did.  They engaged the powerfighters.  But Paradigm noticed he had made a small error."

"event","...In Spain, Black Hole leaned against a wall while the Drill, a super-cyborg sporting diamond-bit drills for hands, dug into the newest wall The Conquistador had put in the Horde's way.  'It's just a matter of time..' Black Hole mused. Goalpost came to attnetion and faced Black Hole, ""Master...Prism sends a message she says she requires more back up.  The resistance she has reached is too intense.""  Black Hole paused rubbing his chin.  He hadn't expected stiff enough resistance that Prism and three of the stronger members of the Horde wouldn't be able to handle it. Black Hole ordered, ""Super Saur...go w/ Goalpost to backup my daughter.""  The massive reptilian rose as ordered.  He was one of the few members of the Horde Black Hole honestly respected.  Super Saur was an imbecile but he Never questioned Black Hole, and did more than his share in a  fight.  Goalpost was a sentient robot of no mean proportions but Super Saur made even him seem slender and fragile.  The reptilian was 8 feet tall and looked 8 feet wide. He was all muscle, and sometimes anger. Super Saur stepped to Goalpost trusting Black Hole's order to fulfilled somehow.  Goalpost seemed genuinely surprised to be assigned the job.  That amused Black Hole some, the robot seemed afraid. ""Go on Goalpost...""Black Hole ordered.  The sentient robot lowered his head and declared, ""Super Saur hold on to me.""  Super Saur obeyed and brought Goalpost into a very tight embrace. Black Hole had to laugh at the discomfort Goalpost seemed to be in. Goalpost engaged his bootjets, angled his body out the cavehole in the Conk's wall and rocketed off.  Black Hole was getting frustrated, he looked to the Drill.  ""How much longer?!""
The Drill wasn't terribly powerful or valuable to Black Hole so every chance he got he tried to prove his worth. ""Uhm...maybe an hour sir?"" he offered back hoping that would be fine.  Black Hole growled. That was too long. Drill was tempted to ask, ""How long should it take master?"" to seek appeasing Black Hole but that might be seen as sarcasm.  And the Drill did not think he could survive Black Hole misunderstanding his intentions. ""Uhm....Maybe half an hour.."" The Drill shifted nervously. He didn't admit to Black Hole that he had reached a level of the wall that not only stopped his progress cold, but was dulling his bits.  Black Hole sensed the misleading.  He ordered the Drill to stop, and for all the Horde-mates to move aside.  Most did in a hurry.  Black Hole began to concentrate.  he called cosmic rays down into the cavehole, using them to amplify his own power, he began to focus a very small/huge black hole against the wall. Maniphesting a black hole was the easy part, making sure it didn't consume his team and everything about him was the part he had to concentrate on.  Black Hole's fiery white hair plumed and blossomed over his head as he focused turning as much cosmic energy into gravity as possible.  It was a stunt he had never really tried before.  When the black hole reached capacity he would try another stunt.  Black Hole smiled."

"event","...Marcel felt himself slammed into the broken cobblestone street of Atlantis, neck-first.  And then came blissfull numbness.  He knew he had his neck broken.  He was not overly concerned, he was still alive and by concentrating, if he wished, he would still be able to rise and move by manipulating the power. Marcel did not wish to.  Ramadvor stood over him, looking down on him w/ a sickening smirk. ""Traitor,'said the Ranq, 'Don't you wish now you hadn't betrayed me?"" 
 Marcel found he didn't need to use the power to be able to respond by saying, ""I never betrayed you slavemonger!""    
 ""I have broken your neck haven't I? So torturing you would be fruitless wouldn't it?"" Ramadvor sneered. ""Yes my chattel you did betray me. Nearly a century ago I dispatched you to this world to comandeer it for me, so I might occupy it. You betrayed me."" Ramadvor explained slowly to the Rock.
 Marcel growled back, ""No 'Master,' you sent me to do a job.  I tried. I failed. You never retrieved me so I quit your service."" 
 ""You failed...'Ramadvor chuckled, 'and became friends w/ your new conqueror, the Green Man. How convenient."" Through force of will and use of the power Marcel sat himself up. Ramadvor took a step back. 
""Convenient...? The Green Man defeated me in my every endeavor for 23 years. Eventually even a Rock realizes if you can't beat them, join them."" Marcel spat.  
  ""So you quit one conqueror for another. Who knew you Rocks quit so easilly."" Ramadvor rubbed his own bare chest. ""This one barely put up a fight, all power and no brain. Heh"" Ramadvor finished and took another step back as Marcel forced his body to stand. He wobbled a bit at first. Ramadvor's rabid grin grew seeing Marcel off balance.  ""All these years and you are so much more powerful Marcel, but not powerful enough.' Ramadvor looked Marcel up and down assessingly, 'You'll never be powerful enough.""  
  Marcel snarled back, being slightly tired of living and definitely tired of Ramadvor's banter, ""Do you kill all Rocks by talkiing them to death?!""  Ramadvor's smile disappeared. Ramadvor took half of one step and disappeared, when he reappeared his fist was several inches in Marcel's stomach.  Not breaking the skin but smashing into his abdomen at speeds even Marcel couldn't imagine. Breath left Marcel as he doubled over on the Ranq's fist.  He hadn't felt  or seen the ranq move.  ""H...ho...how..."" he barely croaked.  
  Ramadvor smiled to him, ""It's Maaaaaaaagic!"" in a mocking tone. Marcel didn't know much about biology but it felt like something important deep inside his stomach had been liquified. 

 A loud impact explosion woke Brondites. What was happening?  Oh yeah aliens were attacking Atlantis.  A very well built power fighter had engaged him.  before he had time enough to realize the danger, the power fighter had made his world turn black. Very few of Brondites muscles didn't hurt right then. Pain.  Pain meant Brondites was still alive.  He snaked one hand down his side...the Quiver of Zeus was gone.  It likely fell off from the blast from that power fighter. Brondites closed the part of his mind where the Fomorian Baalor had planted his essence and opened his eyes. Baalor had planted a curse on Brondites when the Olympian had slain him. If Brondites was not careful all the he looked upon would fall to the wrath of Baalor, intense magical beams of force would emanate from his eyes. Even his fellow gods weren't proof against it's power. It took the better part of 200 years but Brondites had learned to control the curse and use it as a power. Now he saw the darkened sky, he heard voices speaking but not what they said.  He tilted his head in such a manner that if he wasn't flat on his back he'd have been looking straight up in the air.  Instead he saw the huge power fighter and the Torch Marcel. The power fighter looked to be holding Marcel up by his stomach.  'Now' a voice deep inside Brondite's head said, 'Now strike them both down!'  
  'No! Baalor I am in control' he reminded the Fomorian. 
  'Fine then Olympian, control them...' Baalor sulked and teased in the same breath. Control them... the words rang w/ invention and an idea was born.

  Marcel hung from Ramadvor's grasp. The Ranq was now holding Marcel up by his stomach muscles, like his stomach was some sort of handle.  Marcel was still glad he couldn't feel anything but was running low on willpower.  ""Feel the steady calm Marcel, you will die.  I am making you suffer for one reason, I do not suffer betrayers.""  Marcel's head flopped over unintentionally, he was losing his will.  If he lost it all together now, he'd just die. Marcel didn't want to live anymore.  He was tired, and felt impotent.  He suddenly had no more to give.  And then he noticed the Olympian move.  Brondites tilted his head and winked...at Marcel.

  Brondites wasn't truelly winking at him, he was just closing the eye that would have fired on Marcel. With his open right eye he released the Vision of Baalor and streams of unrelenting, battering magic forcebeams struck the Ranq from the side. Ramadvor dropped marcel in surprize and was launched better than 2 miles away.  Marcel had to laugh evilly as he fell flat in the dust.  His will to live reborn."

"event","... Magna sped across the Earth's electro-magnetic sky carrying Justice. That explosion they had seen had marked Quint saving Omus. Justice and Magna couldn't get any closer, the explosion had been too great and now 3 more Wingers were in the air. Justice needed to rally his troops and fall back.  The U.S. Congress had outlawed telepathy for fear of it's ramifications. But what the legislative branch didn't know, wouldn't hurt them. Justice gave a hearty psi-shout, ""GATE!"" to the psionic Torch. A psi-shout was the only way for a non-telepath to call out to attract a telepath. It was like yelling into the dark, sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn't. Justice began to feel the twinge in his brain that meant Gate had heard him and was preparing to answer. Telepathic communication could be a beautiful thing or a horrible torture. Gate took great pains to make it pleasant for his comrades and hell for foes. ""Justice..'Gate answered and tried to detect his commander's whereabouts. Justice began, ""I need to..""and a tremendoes red heat beat lanced from behind a small tenement before Justice and Magna. Magna stopped her foreward flight motion to dodge the arcing heat beam. A wide force beam encompassed the 2 Torches.  Neither was able to shield or dodge it.  Only their natural durabilties saved them from being atomized.  The world turned black and both brave souls freefell 15 stoies to the waiting street and the trio of Trollaxe, Cudgel, and Punk.

  Gate growled he knew where they were but not what Justice wanted.  Gate, Icey, and Walker had been assigned to guard the only hospital still standing in the downtown area.  So far the few Nefarians who had attacked here were fairly easily driven off w/ a minor show of power. Gate looked back to Icey and Walker, he didn't know them well.  He knew they were brave but not very powerful.  It was Gate who had scared off the giant bird, metal cat, and truck-sized ant. Could the white haired girl in the sea green bikini and the low level mage hold this position while Gate went to Justice and Magna's rescue?  He'd have to risk it. Telepathically he updated them both on the plan.  Walker ignited a firey magic sword and Icey took Gate's position, ready for the brunt of anything. He smiled, they were brave if nothing else. 

    Gate was an alien from a peaceful race of psionics who looked like starscapes.  Gate had reached a certain pinnacle of power during his career as a Torch and was given a choice, evolve or die.  He chose to die. He chose a mortal life.  In fact he chose a human form and rejoined the Torches.  Most of the newer Torches didn't know he was even an alien and gate liked that.  He felt like he fit in more. Gate launched himself telekinetically aloft and flew to where he had last detected Magna and Justice. He flew like a silent rocket.  As he approached he saw 2 truelly massive robots, one looked like a 28 foot tall troll, the other like a red armored robot of simialr dimensions and a small robot(roughly human-sized) of dark black and purple armor surrounding and closing in on the prone duo.  Gate might not make it in time before one laid hands on his teammates. He concentrated and expanded a force bubble of telekinetic force around his comrades. The little one, Punk, actually walked into the bubble and bounced off not seeing it. Trollaxe just walked into it and stopped.  Cudgel tapped the top of the forcefield. ""I need to get them out of here...but how?' thought Gate.  He could attack all three but if one got off a lucky shot or hit on him, there'd be 3 prone Torches instead of 2. Gate landed and none of the three seemed to notice him. The giat troll-bot, Trollaxe wheeled back and spun in a circle twice, as he finished his second circle he chopped down w' his electro-axe. The electro-axe looked like a club til it's owner hit a secret button then it would project a cutting stream of electrons in the shape of an axe blade. Trollaxe's mighty strike bounced off Gate's forcebubble, but Gate had felt that. Feeling the blow meant that Trollaxe was strong enough almost to break his forcefield. Gate thought quickly....."

"event","..Quint shrieked dramatically and jumped back down beside Omus in their fortifications here. The shriek was just the bait to keep the Wingers charging in. As he landed, Quint took up the gigantic RPGL3000 and braced the backend against the ground. It was too heavy even for Quint to hold and fire but he could hold it. Bracing the backend, he aimed straight up in the air, like a mortar.  As the Nefarians closed on him and looked in the fortified nest he and Omus shared, Quint fired.  The Nefarians stopped dead in their tracks and all watched tracking the small rocket that was the grenade, fly so high and then turn...and dive back toward them.  The more intelligent of the Nefarians launched themselves into the air.  Strafe, their maroon leader, took off running like a track star. Quint had to smile as he scooped up Omus and the gun, and dove into the icey ocean.


Given the distance Quint was able to swim underwater at his top speed, all he heard was a satisfying explosion."

"event","....Justice repeated the plan quickly for Wilbur and the assembled crowd.  ""You know what to do...just listen to Torch Marshall Wilbur and you will all go home tonight.""  Most of the crowd nodded, some of the younger people looked to Wilbur unconvinced.  Magna had been ready to carry out the plan before the first repition and stood guard in the dark at the abse of the stairwell.  A shadow fell over the stairwell and she saw the dark blue legs of the robot called Hype begin to descend the staircase.  ""Justice!"" she hissed. Hype heard but did not see the nubian beauty, turned and yelled, ""hey Boss! I found 'em!""  Justice looked, and turned to Wilbur, ""Go man!  You know what to do!""  The old man turned to the herd of fearful onlooker and waved his arms, ""C'mon people!""  As they began to move the ceiling above them broke open, several jagged chunks of cement fell in and crushed people. Willard looked on agahast. A monstrous orange leg came through the breech and was coming down toward Wilbur as he stood stunned. Justice had to move but he had two places to be. 'When in doubt, take your shield out,' Justice thought. In one easy move he pitched his disc shield at Hype and knocked the pipsqueaked psycho over.  W/ a speed uncommon he jumped between Wilbur and Pyrat's foot bracing.  Interlocking his fingers beneath the tyrant's foot he effectively caught it. In his next move, he pulled his arms up and basically tossed Pyrat back out of the hole and on his large robotic ass. Justice whirled on Wilbur and poited at him to get his attention, ""Move now man!""  Wilbur seemed to wake from a nightmare, gathered the flock, and lead them into the incredible dark of the unlit New York subway system. Justice turned and saw Magna not only had his shield but was lifting Hype over her head.  Hype was screaming something about ""Unfair, Unfair"" before Magna tossed him unceremoniously out! Justice had to laugh everytime a foe crabbed about unfair combat conditions. Magna waved to Justice to 'come along', ""Time to boogie baby!""  Justice charged over, Magna handed him back his shield, wrapped an arm around his back and took off like a rocket.  Her power was to absorb electromagnetic energy and turn it into superstrength, flight, magnetic fire blasts, and durability.  Justice was constantly glad to have her on his side. As they flew out of the subway, Magna saw Chronalcannon make a snatch at them and she dodged. ""Where to now?"" she asked the patriotic commander. ""We have to regroup....we search the old fashioned way.""  She knew that meant looking for trouble, and hoping a Torch or 2 might be there. She flew off to the east, carrying Justice easilly.  A large explosion had just gone off that looked familiar.

  You didn't have to tell the large Rebdiljian, that this would be a fracas to remember.  Omus didn't think he'd survive this fight but so far it had been pretty fun. He smiled a huge snaggletoothed grin.  In the initial charge by the robots most of the cops he was backing up had died.  Omus would morn them later. Now was the time to get busy. Time to use the RPG Launcher 3000 some more. After blowing the legs off the big winged one the rest had gotten more respectful. A 25 foot tall maroon winger(as he was beginning to refer to the winged ones) seemed to be in command. 4 wingers were hiding behind 4 different building taking pot shots on him, the cops and his best buddy Quint. Adventure was what Omus lived for and it was why he had joined the Torches, it wasn't everyday he got to open up w/ the RPGL3000.  He planned to enjoy it.  The legless white winger flopped about leglessly and none of his comrades would come assist him. Omus did not appreciate their cowardice or the fact they wouldn't rush at him foolishly.  Omus didn't fire on the building directly, he didn't know if they were fully evacuated yet. Only a coward attacked the unarmed, and unadventurous. No Omus was busy picking and lining up his shots as Quint watched his back. Quint had been relatively unbothered yet. None of the Nefarians had dared attack them from the rear.  The fact that the rear was the water probably helped a bit. Quint saw a flash and Omus fell over beside him. The young African-American had been through a lot lately w/ time spent in the Negotiate's omniverse, and recovering.  He was in no shape to lose his pal. ""OMUS!""  he screamed and leapt to his friend's side. The Nefarians did not stop firing. Omus seemed to be breathing, he didn't even seem injured. And then w/ his superhumanly fast reactionability and speed he spied a tiny robotic fly lift off Omus' neck and flew straight at him! Using his superspeed, Quint managed to dodge under the fly and swipe at it.  The robot obviously didn't expect that, for it didn't even try to dodge.  Quint snagged it by it's buzzing wing. The little robot went still and fell back against his gloved thumb. Quint sneered and tossed the little robot at the ground as hard as he could. The tiny fly-sized bot bounced along the broken street stunned.  Quint leapt forward and stomped the robot flat before it could recover and escape. Omus lifted his head a few inches from the sandbag he had fallen on and whipered, ""Wingrrrrs..."" before his eyes closed and he began snoring.  Nobody snored like Omus. Quint spun and looked to where the winged Nefarians had been basically hiding and saw them slowly stalking out. Since he looked unarmed they were going to try and tear him limb from limb by hand, no doubt. Realizing they were noticed, the Wingers charged.  Their maroon leader laughed as he charged in. Quint knew he coult outrun these tools, but not carrying Omus.  Omus had kept the bots at bay for the better part of an hour w/ his RPGL3000.  Quint had no long range powers or weapons. What could he do? An idea struck Quint."

"event","....It was amazing what the robot's laser redirection forcefield could do, Marvel pondered as he flew off carrying the wounded and unconcious form of Wildcat.  While the robot hadn't actually damaged Marvel's armor it had taken Wildcat out completely. Luckilly the explosion had also knocked the radium raider into the tunnel below, effectively burying itself. Marvel checked the emergency frequencies. Most long range was out, the cops, fire departments, ambulance. The hams were taking over for them w/ the Red Cross amateur bands. Listening in the chatter, he found a hospital that was relatively unscathed and cybernetically commanded his armor to fly in that direction. Using the suit's sensors he scanned Wildcat.  Some bumps and bruises showed up w/ sonar. Must have just hit his head, nothing serious. Over the short wave came a message, ""Hype to Trollaxe, Cudgel, Punk...Hype to Trollaxe, Cudgel, and Punk, come in by order of Commander Pyrat!"" The message was delivered by a robotic voice w/ an accent of street punk. Pyrat.  Hadn't Tech Force recieved intel that the leader of a band of marauders named the Nefarians had a new leader w/ the handle Pyrat?  Marvel checked his armor's computer records as he closed on the hospital.

..""I repeat Hype to Trollaxe, Cudgel, and Punk!  Do any of you read, over!"" the tiny Nefarian held his hand to his ear to help boost his own inner-radio's gain. He looked to Pyrat.  Pyrat looked pissed.  One didn't want to fail when Pyrat was pissed. He decided to try again, rather than admit failure. Pyrat looked to Chronalcannon, ""Are your broadcasting abilities any stronger?"" Chronalcannon shook his head sadly, ""No, communications were an after thought when my new body was built.""  Pyrat looked back to Hype, even more pissed off. He did not like not having a proper communication officer. 'Someone' would be rebuilt as a communications officer after this mission. Hype held up his opposite hand to get Pyrat's attention, and sent the signal through his own voice box to project the response. ""Cudgel replying to a call from Pyrat! Cudgel to Pyrat?"" Pyrat smiled.  ""Hello mighty Cudgel I request that you and your squad move to intergalactic coordinates 4.556.9427.""  Cudgel replied back over the Hype/radio:""You want us there?  You told us to go.."" A mettalic clang sound was heard before the voice of Trollaxe came over the speaker,:""Yes master, at once!"" Pyrat had to smile, neither Cudgel or Trollaxe were geniuses but they would follow orders.  Now if only Vectorwing did half as well.  

  Vectorwing realized beneath the tons of street atop him, he wasn't doing half as well as he should be. Two puny superheros had not only attacked w/ little fear but escaped.  Not good at all. But the attack had only begun. He still had time to rack up a killcount. Hmm how to get loose.  Firing his guns might cut him a way free but might hit something beneath the ground that was explosive. Well anyway he got out he was goung to get scratched up some.  His beautiful armor.  The idea of his dark slate grey and neon green armor battle damaged made him see red. With a stifled roar he engaged his boot and wing jets, and quickly stood throwing his hands over his head.  Tons of debris exploded and was thrown about him. His jets had room to breath and tossed him skyward w/ a merry laugh.  Yes there was still time."

"event",".... After nearly half an hour of constant battle, Justice HAd gotten his shield back. Less than 5 seconds ago though he had been on the wrong end of one of Pyrat's massive punches.  As he had landed and skidded 150 odd yards, he mused bleeding, 'Next time, shield'. It was Justice's own private joke. Anytime he actually got hit he would remind himself to next time use the shield.  He rolled on his side and looked down the street, he had been hit the better part of a mile. ""Wow,"" he said impressed and hurting. Chronalcannon seemed to be staring at him. 'Must be aiming'he thought. He hardly had the strength to try and dodge. Trying to sit up brought tears to his eyes. Chronalcannon's shoulder gun swiveled and pointed toward him. The pain in his ribs was too much, Justice fell back on his back. He couldn't even defend himself and now he was going to be killed by a bloodthirsty robot from outer space.  There was nothing funny in that idea. Justice heard a tiny tinny voice say his ear, ""Boss let go of your shield!"" Justice recognized and trusted the voice, he let go his only weapon. Chronalcannon made his finaly targetting adjustments and a shapely long haired lady flew up and snatched Justice's shield. Still flying she put his shield on her arm, and stood in Chronalcannon's way. Chronalcannon fired his own reactions not being as fast as the dark garbed woman's. The shield easily took the brunt of the blast and it looked as though Pyrat was being assaulted by an invisible assailant. Everytime Pyrat swung back at whatever was assailing him, all he hit was air. Pyrat growled his anger and barked, ""Chronalcannon destroy this fool!"" Instinctively Chronalcannon swung his hand rifle at Pyrat. Pyrat held up his hands to ward off the blast and screamed, ""Becareful you imbecile!"" Chronalcannon lowered his weapon and Pyrat delivered a right hook to his second that must have loosened some fuses. Chronalcannon fell a  few dozen feet away, and all running lights off. He'd been knocked the fuck out!  Pyrat roared his rage and projected his plasma omni-directionally. A tiny 'whoah' was heard before the plasma ball engulfed the titanium tyrant. A speck reappeared beside Justice and suddenly grew..into a man w/ an odd helmet. ""Bumblebee"" Justice whispered hoarsely. ""I'm here..don't move boss!""  Magna stood watching Chronalcannon's running lights blink back on as Pyrat's plasma ball snuffed out. She held Justice's shield ready to defend her teammates.  Bumblebee worked quickly, he wore metal gloves that could blast bio-neural blasts, he pulled their clips from them and slapped in new white ones. Placing his gloved hands on his leader's chest he blasted a white light into him. Justice inhaled sharply, not in pain. The blast was a single blast from a device commonly referred to as a 'Heal-o-beam'.  It repaired bological damage, healing effciently.  Justice wasn't completely healed, but he felt he could go on. He rose, leaning on Bumblebee. The shrinking-Torch reloaded his gauntlets and looked to his larger comrade.  ""You look shakey boss...you want a one-way to the med center?"" Justice shook his head. ""No, is the city evacked yet?""  Bumblebee was forced to shake his head.  ""We need to keep a holding pattern here, corral these basterds in til..."" Justice wasn't sure what 'til' was. Bumblebee's jaw dropped. That was only the second time he had ever heard Justice curse. A small dragon the size of a cat appeared between the heros and lighted on Bumblebee's shoulder. ""Hey Zip!  What's the word?"" The small dragon answered Bumblebee telepathically. ""Hey boss, Zip asked me 'didn't the Nefarians have some ancient enemies' er sumthin..I can't remember their names. Do you?""  Justice Had only met the leader of the Nefarians ancient enemies once. Adamant. That was his name. What was the race called. Magna yelled over her shoulder to answer them both, ""The Palatene!""  Chronalcannon was up and fired his shoulder cannon on her, the shield easilly taking the blasts. Justice saw Chronalcannon was really just providing cover fire for Pyrat and Hype, as they charged down the street toward the heros.  ""Yeah Bumblebee, she's right.  The Palatene! Go back to Torch Island and try and contact them.  At the very least maybe we can sicc them on these guys!  Go NOW!"" Bumblebee shrank and his dragon disappeared. Justice shouted to Magna like a quarterback, ""Cover 2B, fallback.""  Of course she knew what this maneuver code was and obeyed him immediately. Dropping her stance and her place she flew backwards scooped up Justice and soared the opposite direction of Pyrat and company.

  Almost a mile a way Magna landed, setting Justice down. Justice ran down a nearby subway stairwell. Magna flew down behind him.  Justice listened, he could hear people down here.  ""Magna I need intel now."" Being former CIA agent Magna was used to these situations and could be counted on for all available info.  The beautiful African-American woman reported,  ""Communications are still down.  May be a miracle for Bumb to get a message off planet. These Nefarians have spread out through the city and after initial destruction seem to be focusing on looting.  That's the good news.""  ""Good news?"" Justice questioned.  ""Yes, our lines are so stretched out across the city I don't know who's still alive.  I can't find Bludgeon and if something happens to Bumblebee we may not find out until too late.  Our supply lines are down."" she reported.  From the darkness a man approached the duo, he looked to be crying.  ""Are you the Torches?"" he asked his voice wavering. ""Yes,' Justice replied offering the man his hand. The man fell to his knees and began to weep openly, ""You're gonna save us all right?""  Justice looked down the subway tunnel, his vision now adjusted to the semi-dark, he saw dozens of people down here. ""Damn it,' Justice growled to himself. Magna looked to Justice w/ tears in her eyes.  This was too big, the look seemed to say to him. He steeled his jaw and picked the man up. Putting him on his feet, Justice asked him, ""What's your name soldier?"" The man looked more like a librarian than a soldier. Grey hair, glasses, a paunch that suggested he liked donuts too much. ""My name?  My name is Wilbur..."" he replied.  Justice smiled to the ordinary man. ""Good Wilbur, that was my father's name. I need your help."" Wilbur's eyes went wide.  ""My help?""  ""Yes, Wilbur I need you to help me get these people gathered up. I hereby declare you a Torch Marshall.""  'Torch Marshall?' Magna had never heard of one of those before. Justice continued and raised his voice, ""Excuse me everyone, I have just deputized Wilbur as a Torch Marshall. Wilbur is eminintly qualified to lead you out of this situation, but you have to listen to him.  Everyone bunch up over here."" As if controlled by some unseen force the terrified, disheveled people gathered about Justice, Wilbur, and Magna. Wilbur turned to Justice and asked, ""Me?  I can get these people out?!"" Justice looked Wilbur straight in the eye and honestly told him, ""I hope so Wilbur, I'm counting on you.""  Wilbur pulled up his belt, stood up straight, dryed his eyes, straightened his thinning hair, and looked to the crowd. Magna was forced to smile, 'Atleast now the senior man looked something like a soldier.'"

"event","...Deeper in the sprawling city, Wildcat sat atop a tall building in extreme disgust.  New York was his adopted town and now these B-movie rejects were trashing it.  Everywhere he looked giant robots were blasting or trashing.  Enough was enough.  Wildcat didn't know if the Torches were coming, but he couldn't wait. He picked a slate grey and neon green flying robot as his target,he stood tall before he dove.  This one had flown off from it's flock or whatever....he'd start w/ this one.  Despite being of slender build, and less than average height Wildcat possesed some amazing powers.  He had the speed and agility of a cat, hence the name. Small claws and superstrength allowed him to climb buildings and having the ability to project short range tractor beams from his hands didn't hurt either.  As he swooped toward his target it suddenly flew forward to dodge him despite not seeing him falling. ""New problem,' he thought. As he whizzed past the robot's head he noticed it seemed to have a fully articulated face. It was smiling...Ok killer robots from the Conk he could handle but evil robots who liked what they were doing...that was too much! Wildcat snaked out a forearm and blasted the 27 foot tall robot in the face w/ a tractorbeam. The robot looked surprized and Wildcat retracted his tractorbeam to cause a rubber band type of effect. The tall robot growled as it swung too late at the nimble mutate.  Wildcat swung himself over the robot's head and landed on it's back. Bearing down w/ his claws, releasing his tractorbeam and reattaching the beam to the titanium titan's back, Wildcat took in his situation. ""What....No human worm is that fast! Why I'll..."" it barked. Wildcat had to smile, and whistled like one might to attract a dog. The large mechannoid tried to turn at it's waist to see him but it's massive wings blocked him from it's sight.  ""Oh good show human....Maybe you should join w/ me and.."" The robot never finished the sentence.  Instead it engaged it's foot thrusters forward and attempted to smash the hero into the building behind it.  Attempted because our hero jumped to that self same wall first and scooted up it. Now the robot was stuck wings-first in the building. Wildcat stood out from the wall in a perfect 90 degree looking down to the struggling robot. The robot looked up and very distinctly glared, it's anger evident.  ""Looks like Radio Shack or the Conk or where ever you come from makes good toys!"" He teased the robot.  ""Toys?!  Toys!! I'll show you toys fool!"" and though the long guns on the robot's upper arms were pointed down, it blasted. Wildcat watched. About 20 feet down the twin lasers hit a grid looking forcefield and ricocheted back up. Wildcat just leapt. He didn't care where he was, beside not there.  He knew where those beams were going. As he leapt out and over the robot, the beams barely missing him he realized he had a new problem. How to land. Wildcat flipped so atleast he was falling feet first. Falling 40 feet wouldn't be too bad, being almost twice that high...well that was bad. This was bad. 'This may hurt,' He thought as his mind raced. Tagging the bot had worked once...why not again. Aiming at the bot's feet as he flew past them..he....was slammed from below but not by something overly painful.  It felt like he had been caught. Turning his head to the right, he saw he had been caught and was in the arms of the burly armored warrior known only as Marvel Warrior. ""Marv!"" he exclaimed gladly.  ""Thee one and only..now let's set you down before your friend gets free!"" Marvel landed and placed Wildcat on his feet. The robot was growling and cursing as he struggled to get free.  Finally it pointed all four of it's arm guns at Wildcat and Marvel Warrior and fired, but as before the energy beams met a forcefield and were redirected.  Apparently the robot controlled that forcefield because this time it's lasers came back and blew up the wall surrounding it. It's feet thrusters roared new life and their master laughed.  ""Laughing robots..now I have seen everything!"" Marv quipped. ""Yeah it even gets pissed off.  I haven't managed to make it cry yet but I only engaged it right before you got here....I want one for Christmas only one w/ a personality."" Wildcat bantered back.  The robot looked angry enough to spit, ""PERSONALITY!?!?!  What would you amoebas know of personality?! I have scraped more interesting animal droppings from my foot pedals than your entire misbegotten race can aspire to!""  Marv raised his hands ready to rumble. Wildcat jibed back at the robot, ""Hey Johnny 5 is it amoebas or worms?   Did he just brag about wiping more shit off his shoes than the enire human race? Keep your insults straight!"" The robot seemed to grow even angrier, ""Worms...Amoebas...even those lackluster proto-species outrank you and your ilk! I have never..""  Wildcat interrupted, ""Made love to a woman?""  Marv looked to Wildcat w/ a small laugh. What was the mad vigilante trying to do? The robot screamed and threw himself from his hovering point 75 feet up down at Wildcat and Marv where they stood in the street. Wildcat leapt aside easilly laughing, and Marv flew up and over the robot as it crashed fist(and face) first in the street.  As he flew over Marv released an ionic repulsor wave into the robot's back.  When Wildcat stopped flipping, he fell down. He held his sides and laughed.  The robot was now stuck w/ one arm and it's head in the street, likely a sewer.  Marv even had to laugh a bit as he landed opposite it. W/ his armor's enhanced auditory capabilities he could hear the robot shouting and cursing underground.  Wildcat rose and walked closer and placed one foot on the arm of the robot,  ""Take a picture Marv, I wanna hang a copy of this in my living room!""  Marv chuckled ""It isn't out yet."" Wildcat chuckled, ""I know but when will I ever get to brag about something like this again?""  ""You.."" Marvel found his armor was able to sense some of the robot's systems, and his computers told him the robot was struggling to break free.  Marv looked to Wildcat, ""Look Oouw..""  And the street blew up beneath them."

"event","...It could be argued that Fate hates New York City.  And what did the Big Apple ever do to fate, the world of men may never know.  Men and women hustled and bustled going to and fro from work, gathering groceries, visiting mates, playing w/ children.  They drove cars, and boats, helicopters, and hovercraft. None drove quickly enough. The portal that opened up on the delta of the Hudson appeared at nearly 3 miles tall.  One onlooker had a heart attack, and died watching it open. A tuba sound belched forth and many robotic beings varying in height between 6 to 35 feet tall forth poured forth. One robot was even 450 feet tall. Each robot was a different height. Most ran and the winged ones flew from the portal.  All spewed dangerous energy beams in the form of fire, lasers, sonic beams, or plasma. Some released missiles and rockets and all brought death.  One orange-gold robot of somewhat larger build turned it's hands into gun nozzles and sprayed deadly plasma down a busy trafficed street. Laughing maniacally he commanded, ""Nefarians!  Take them!""  His troops gleefully answered their commander w/ a roar and redoubled their efforts. Even in New York this wasn't a common enough situation for typically nonplussed New Yorkers to not panic over. Hype, a tiny sized robot jumped 40 feet into the air to land in a herd of fleeing people.  He laughed as the poor people were crushed beneath his weight. He stood up and punched those that could still flee.  His minute strength more than enough to tear people apart.  Though human sized his strength was not. A metallic eagle the size of an f-14 jet zipped between the towers of the metropolis, buzzing building and tearing great chunks from the structures w/ it's claws and it's chainsaw tail. A metal jaguar the size of innercity bus tackled a truck.  Overturning it kicked at it's prey w/ it's hindlegs effectively disemboweling it. The driver of the truck had the strength of mind to try to escape but merely jumped into the waiting cat's jaws.  The large bot known as Chronalcannon silently marched down the street picking his targets.  No human could stand up to a blast of pure temporal energy but no sense wasting power. The winged Nefarians maneuvered and strafed the canyon-like walls of the buildings as they flew deeper into the city. This was Strafe's kind of sport. Against slow ground bound weaklings. He yelled to Ranquor his wingman, ""It doesn't get any better than this!  Does it?""  The typically sullen Ranquor had to push the smile from his metal face. ""It's ok...I guess.  Atleast we haven't been shot down yet."" He responded. Strafe shook his head, there was no pleasing some Nefarians. Then Strafe saw Vectorwing break off from the detachment. 'Why'd he do that?' he wondered. Remembering his still sore jaw he stopped wondering.  'Screw that blamebot, hope he gets himself smashed to crap and back!' he suddenly wished the worst for his comrade. 
   Pyrat was overjoyed how well the attack was going.  Chronalcannon was guarding his back, his hand plasma cannons were working optimally and he had a very respectable kill count. Perhaps Wontin was right, this would work if all teams followed the plan, but opposition had still been planned for.  Where were the Torches?  They should have been here....and right then Pyrat ducked instinctively.  The form of the dimunitive Hype went flying over his head.  He looked the direction Hype had come from.  ""Ah, the Torches!""

     Justice had found Hype bent over the now dead form of a young lady.  he had just pummeled her to death and was turning to the baby carriage she had been pushing. Not being able to stop the woman's death had burned Justice, angered him badly, but he saw red as Hype reached for the infant. Justice jumped feet first into the man-sized robot's chest knocking it back.  ""What de..?!"" Hype barked keeping to his stereotypical range of comebacks.  Before he could finish that question, Justice had ducked, foot swept and hiptossed him at Pyrat. Pyrat was smiled seeing how far Hype had flown.  ""You are very strong little Earthling but not strong enough! Eat plasma maggot!"" Pyrat barked as he pointed and fired his hang plasma cannons.  In one easy fluid move Justice swung his shield off his back and blocked the plasma.  Despite the fact it was just a disc, the shield had an aura power that deflected all attacks toward it's wielder. It also had the power to win wars. Justice looked over the edge of his shield at the gigantic robotic terrorist. The bot was w/in 50 feet of him. Two big leaps and he'd be at it's feet. Plasma or no. Justice angled the shield over his head and leapt forward twice.  He moved so fast Pyrat didn't notice until his plasma stream melted the building base behind where Justice had been. Pyrat was too big for him to foot sweep so he decided to check how much Pyrat weighed. Pyrat looked down on the flag-clad hero just in time to have Justice's shield ricochet off his face plate. That stunned the tyrannical collosus long enough for Justice to duck down, grip, and use his super strength.  To Justice's surprize he could lift Pyrat, so w/ a quick rise and a hip twist he unceremoniously dumped the tin tyrant over. Justice had to smile, 'bigger they come, harder they fall.' Forgetting for too long about Pyrat's bodyguard, Justice was lined up for Chronalcannon to snipe. Justice would never see it coming. Thanks to Blurr.  The superspeedster snatched Justice from the tremendous torrent of temporal energy just in time. Mimicing Hype unintentionally, Justice asked, ""What the...Who?"" and looked to the proud Blurr.  ""Just me, Bossman. Only 2801 more times of saving your butt and we can call it even!""  Justice had to smile, he had gotten Blurr out of jail early to help the Torches fight a time bandit. Now Blurr was on parole and despite his flightyness, was one of the most reliable Torches on the team.  Blurr was constantly making jokes about repaying Justice, but Justice asked nothing from him in return except occasionally to be serious and give his all.  ""Go save someone who needs it!""  Justice joked. ""Will do!"" And w/ a blurry salute Blurr was gone.  Pyrat was gettin up w/ help from Chronalcannon. Justice thought, 'Having some troubles in these tight corridors? Hmmm' Justice's shield had landed closer to Pyrat than himself. Justice hopped off the pile of rubble Blurr had placed him on and charged the titanic duo so he could rescue his shield and continue his part of this battle."

"event","...Black Hole raised a surreptitious gravity bubble around his team as he felt the crab-shuttle closing in on the Conquistador's castle.  How would the unmoveable object respond to the the irresistable force?  Black Hole couldn't wait to find out.  Most of the crew shuddered in fear. Grown men, assasins who killed for sport, not cash, cried and wailed. Black Hole began to rise  w/ seconds to spare and yelled, ""BRACE FOR IMPACT!"" It was needless, he was sheilding the crew, and most assumed fetal-like positions anyway.  That was the problem w/ Earthlings, too afraid of death by and large, and most of the team were from Earth.  Black Hole's fiery white eyes even went wide, not sure even he could survive this impact. As they collided the firey battering claw smashed into part of the Conquistador's castle wall. Air exploded for hundreds of miles around w/ that impact. From Atlantis to Torch island, to England it was heard and felt(this explosion did knock Blurr off his feet). The claw was sticking in the wall of the castle. That meant they had managed to pierce not only the incredible Iron Curtain forcefield around Europe but the impossibly dense wall of the Conquistador's castle. Black Hole roared,  ""Aft doors!"" Several of his crew having been gladdened to still be alive took up their captain's cry, enboldened and ready to punish the Conquistador and his men. A ringing chant of ""Aft Doors!"" rang throughout the claw as  Black Hole and his men charged the same doors.  Jester barely opened the doors in time before the Horde charged out!  Prism was at the head of the charge. The naked crystal woman had abosrbed some of the energy of the impact and had used it to increase her already dramatic superstrength. Gunners on the Conquistador's battlements made the mistake of targeting Prism first w/ their massive ionic cannons. The opaque amazon absorbed the blasts and returned them, destroying the men and most of the guns. Prism laughed, wholesale slaughter was worth more than gold to her. Seeing her mate finally leap free from the ship she zipped by him, flying dangerously close. Jester followed. The Horde had been broken up into squads w/ different missions. Prism, Jester, Phantasm, and Particle Man were to race as far into Spain  as they could and raze as much as they could...to dissuade any back up from coming to Conquistador's aid. Prism found Phantasm and caught her attention. The mistress of psychokinsesis did not disobey or even dare make her mistress unhappy.  Phantasm raced to catch up to Prism and Jester as they flew into Spain's inner airspace.. Particle Man was already on the ground.  Particle Man was Black Hole's alternate self from another dimension w/ different powers. After Black Hole had beaten the Particle Man into submission, he had offered him a place in the Horde.  Black Hole never regretted that descision. Technically speaking Particle man could have been called Prism's uncle but he was her subservient in the Horde. Particle Man was battling some armored human soldiers of the Conquistador.  Actually battling wouldn't be quite the correct term. Toying with, would be better. He would let the soldiers unload their powerful energy rifles fruitlessly against his chest and then, he'd leap amongst them and rip them to shreds w/ his strength alone.  A sport Prism enjoyed in her free-time as well, but now they had no free-time. ""Particle Man, to me!"" She shouted as she and her squad approached. Like the good lap dog he was Particle Man leapt into the air and followed his mistress.


 'So far,' Black Hole mused, 'So good.' True 4 of his less useful teammembers had been eaten by the whithering fire from the Conquistador, but that meant more loot for the rest, and no need to fire the losers. Black Hole almost never fired anyone from the Horde, even those that attempted to betray him. His philosophy was simple, 'Every 'body' served a purpose.' He found that the weak were usually winnowed in true battle, cannon fodder.  And this was quickly becoming a true battle.  Black Hole and his troops were on the beach below the Conquistador's castle. Horribly infalayed, there seemed to be no hope for the Horde. Black Hole thought differently. Hands still behind his back, Black Hole concentrated and hundreds of tons of beach rock suddenly lifted into the air. At his mental request those tons of rocks shot up at machine gun speeds at the Conquistador's gunmen. ""Now!"" Black Hole yelled to his surprized troops, and they charged to the 1000 foot tall wall of the castle. Black Hole flexed his mental muscles and the claw-shuttle slipped out of the crevice it had made in the castle wall.  As the odd ship slipped free, Strobe, Reaver, Gunman, and Scream blasted into the hole.  A few armored soldiers had filled the hole and were annihilated by the combined lasers and sonic beams. Two robots on the Horde flew in unison to the hole after the firing had ended. Twin doors in the smaller green one's chest opened and out leapt a mutant ape and a man w/ the head of a goat, literally. Both let out wild whoops as they entered.  Black Hole knew by the sounds of battle up there, Ape-man and Goatfucker were securing the inner perimeter. Goalpost, the robotic figure that had given them the ride flew in behind them. His stiletto-beam shoulder guns sounding off noisilly. 'Hmm lots of 'em in there,' BLack Hole mused. The 28 foot tall, dark purple robot, Dominion entered next. Black Hole saw plasma ricochet out of the crevice and knew Dominion was firing his arm weapons.  The Nefarian was good for 2 things, his word and his hate of his fellow Nefarians. Realizing now that he was only watching the show, Black Hole lowered the claw-shuttle, and raised the non-flying members of his team into the 'new door' to the Conquistador's castle. As Black Hole floated effortlessly through the new 'entrance' he felt more portals open around the Earth. He did love it when a plan came together."

"event",".....a severe white light overcame the near battlefield and after a deafening explosion, Marcel saw the handiwork he had wrought on the ancient foe of his people. Nih's upper torse, head, and arms were gone. What was left of Nih, slumped to it's knees and toppled.  Marcel couldn't believe what he was seeing. He. Had. Just. Killed. A. Skell. He had just killed a Skell! Marcel wasn't known for celebratory laughter but gave into that temptation for once. He fell back on his backside in the rubble laughing. ""I am thee most powerful Rock to ever live."" He said outloud to an audience of himself. He placed his hands on his knees and relived the relatively short battle again in his mind.  He closed his fists, and flexed. The rest of Atalantis still waited.  No need to call the Torches in, he could handle it himself.  He'd save the pathetic Atlanteans, and the so-called gods by himself. It was a good thing he was already sitting because what heppened next would likely have knocked him flat. A series of sonic booms and a fireball in the shape of a claw swept over Atlantis. To Marcel's mind that it hadn't hit Atlantis made it not his problem. Sitting helped as atmospheric pulses tore the atmosphere part locally. A stream of fire followed the claw down. At a guess the claw appeared ready to collide with Europe somewhere.  Good, maybe it would kill the Conquistador. Marcel smiled. When he woke this morning he hadn't felt this good. He heard footsteps behind himself. Sensing quickly he detected nothing. It might be another Skell. He kipped to his feet and turned to see what might await him next. The remaining dust fell and Marcel saw.  Marcel saw the largest Rock he had ever seen before.  In one of it's hands it dragged a body. Marcel became temporarilly even happier.  The Rock were a rare race and to find another...well here was hope!  Marcel greeted the tall Rock in Kaion, the Rock native language. The large Rock smiled back and answered in English, ""Hello friend!"" The Rock standing before Marcel was truelly a rare specimen. Marcel had seen warriors as big but not as powerful looking before. ""Brother, call me Marcel, there are too few of us left to waste time on titles."" The larger Rock nodded in agreement. Something tickled Marcel's brain. Marcel still wasn't feeling any power from the large Rock. With a soft laugh Marcel said, ""No reason to lower your power brother...the closest Skell is dead.  I killed him. They can't bother you anymore."" The larger Rock smiled evilly and replied, ""you must be the second strongest Rock in the Universe then."" Marcel laughed and was about agree til he realized, ""2nd, brother?"" Marcel scowled at the larger Rock. ""Yes second."" the Rock replied. ""Now I am second to none..."" Marcel looked to his fists and raised his power some.  The larger Rock dropped the person it had been dragging.  Marcel looked to it and recognized Brondites, leader of the Olympians left on Earth. ""Wha..Why?"" Marcel sputtered stunned. The giant Rock seemed to disappear, and when he reappeared Marcel felt 2 things. The larger Rock's power and his massive hand closing around Marcel's throat! Marcel's eyes went open wide. The large Rock leaned in close to Marcel as if he were going to kiss him and whispered, ""Brother...the correct question was 'who'?"" Marcel croaked painfully, ""Whoooo-uhhhhh?"" 

The stranger smiled and licked Marcel's cheek, ""I am your sworn lord and master, Marcel, I am Ramadvor...."""

"event","The Conquistador sat bemused.  He watched the intergalactic crab shaped ship basically appear on the edge of Earth's outer atmospheres. He watched the  claw seem to break off. He easilly did the mathematics in his head neccessary to project the claw's course and was not surprized.  He was surprized when his armor's sensors detected from w/in the claw, one of it's occupants released some of their gravitic power and attacked their own ship. Gravitic power. This had to be Black Hole and the notorious Horde. But why would Black Hole attack a ship he was inside. Ah!  Yes, to blame it on the Earth. The Conquistador steepled his gauntled hands before his chest and watched. Now the claw was seemingly out of control.  No the boosters had kicked in. Not alone the Conquistador's 'help' had learned long ago, 'A lackey who totes a gigantic wrench all day seemingly for no good reason, or opines the obvious to their king gets to be dematerialized first.""  Not too many desired that so they let their king watch the vid-screens in silence.  What did truelly surprize the Conquistador was when the boosters went back off and the aft rockets kicked back in. The he was surprized.


Marcel tried to ready himself but to him the Ranq were the unbeatable devils, and the Skells their top demon lords. The Skell approached him slowly, tail wagging from side to side as it walked. Marcel hated anyone cockier than himself. Marcel managed to overcome his fear long enough to put his fists up before him. The Skell smiled.  ""I am Nih.  I shall be your executioner."" it informed him. Marcel got angrier he really hated cocky assasins. ""Kill Me?! Ha ha ha!"" he tried to laugh as sweat ran down his cheeks. Nih, the Skell smiled closing his eyes. ""Yes you..you are a Rock, no?  I have killed many Rocks in my days."" It opened it's eyes as it looked to him. When their eyes locked images of many Rocks  Nih had hand-killed flooded psychically into Marcel's brain. Marcel knew his defenses were down and growled. Assuming a better fighting stance he raised his defenses and began calling upon his power. A visible aura blew up around him and the Skell stopped walking. Marcel knew he was the mightiest Rock to ever live. Most didn't see 35 let alone 135, but no Rock had ever defeated a Skell before.  Saying out loud to himself, ""Time for the Old College Try!"" Marcel launched himself airborne at his foe. 'One good thing about the Skell', he thought as he attacked, he finally was attacking someone smaller than himself. Nih seemed to disappear even to Marcel's incredible mind, leaving Marcel slamming both feet through the cobblestone that made up this Atlantis street. ""Where?!"" He growled whipping his head about. The Skell had teleported. Nih floated barely four feet over the Rock, and Marcel didn't see him because the Skell used magic instead of power to hold himself aloft. Marcel finally noticed Nih above him just in time to recieve a smaching blow from the Skell's tail tip. Marcel was hit so hard and so fast he made a face first ditch down the street, further dislodging more cobblestones. 'Ow', Marcel thought.  He wasn't one to feed a foes' ego. Nih lighted again. Marcel facefirst in the dirt seemed to tickle him so he laughed. He laughed the laugh of all bullies.  Marcel knew the laugh.  He had laughed it many times himself before he had reformed his ways. Marcel grew angry, and drew his arms under himself. Pushing himself up, he kept his back to Nih.  He knew the Skell was too overconfident to attack while he was down. Some of the alien-men watching were laughing at Marcel also. Pushing gravel and dust fron his eyes, he looked to the laughing minions.  They had the good sense to stifle themselves. Marcel was dirty but he didn't even look hurt. Marcel rose and smiled, dusting himelf off he turned to Nih. ""My Nih, If I'd wanted a kiss I'd have raped your mother. Let us level the playing field some, hmm?""  Marcel raised his left palm and Nih could see power rush into it. Nih barked, ""What..what are you doing?!"" Marcel had to smile evilly, besides it was fun. ""Just this..."" A small power orb rose from Marcel's hand. The orb flashed and gave off odd power ratings. With each flash it seemed very powerful and as it dimmed it's power disappeared. Nih had no way to know if it was a bomb or a dud. No Rock ever had power like this! Nih raised his own power to try and protect himself. Marcel laughed and softball pitched the orb at Nih so it flew nice and slow. As he released it, Marcel used his superspeed to fly through the minions of the Ranq who had been laughing at him. Manipulating his power he seemed reappear right where he had begun. Most of the soldiers nearest fell 'apart' to say the least. Marcel saw that Nih had leapt back, and lowered his defenses but had watched Marcel's every move. The orb was going to miss Nih.  Nih smiled, this Rock was smart. Who knew Rocks could be intelligent? It smiled watching Marcel and landed. Marcel mentally commanded the orb to it's full power and to change direction mid-flight. Nih never saw the bomb drop."

"event","Black Hole had to laugh, his daughter's plan had been flawless but further 'braking' right outside the atmosphere had caused even more havoc than he had initially estimated.  The sensors of the Spellgrabber showed that all of the Earth's satellites were out. Black Hole looked to Jester, Prism's mate, and nodded.  Jester toggled the controls that would allow the Spellgrabber's away-shuttle to come loose.  The away-shuttle was actually the ship's left claw. As they had done so many times before Jester piloted the shuttle into Earth's atmosphere. W/ practiced ease he settled the claw-shuttle into it's descent path, and looked to Black Hole. Black Hole raised his hand, still smiling and watching the Earth grow beneath them. Jester waited. Only he and Black Hole knew the plan.  Black Hole psionically focused and had a very small gravitic pulse hit the claw-shuttle from the side. The shuttle shook very hard as if attacked, only Black Hole, and his most powerful officers were left standing.  Prism growled angrilly.  'Good', Black Hole thought, 'Right on cue!' and he dropped his hand w/ a flourish.  Jester noticed and hit the control buttons, alarm lights flashed.  ""Sir, they are firing on us! We're Going To Crash!""  Jester proclaimed as the claw-shuttle began to increase in speed.  ""No, no we'll be fine...I'll take us in.."" Black hole responded and another huge gravitic pulse rocked the ship.  Black Hole 'fell' over this time and the claw-shuttle began to pick up speed. Black hole lay there and feigned being stunned. Jester quickly hit the accelerator to increase their speed even more. The secret plan was to ram the Conquistador's castle from orbit. If the rest of the team knew that though they might try and back out cravenly.  So to bypass an arguement Black Hole had brought Jester in and explained his plan. A plan he didn't even share w/ Prism. Black Hole knew crashing from orbit would only feed her anger and make her the more dangerous for the Conquistador to deal with. Black Hole was not above stacking the deck, or manipulating his team...hell even his own daughter.  It was for the greater good afterall. Most of the Horde was made up of cowards that would beg him not follow through w/ his plan. And if he didn't give into their begging, half would quit.  This way they would go through w/ the plan and fight all the harder believing that the Conquistador had been firing on them before they entered Earth's atmosphere.  Prism braced herself and took up her father's stead. ""Jester! Engage retros!"" She commanded.  Jester pretended to work frantically,""I am trying my love!  But they won't engage!...There they go..but they won't stop us...only slow us."" Warning lights turned from red to yellow. Prism looked to the screens and saw what she thought was the truth. Jester was right, they'd never stop in time. They would impact with the Conquistador's castle! ""Jester! Turn off retros...""she barked. Jester stopped utilizing the controls more than a tad confused. ""Turn off...off..off..the retros?"" He stuttered. ""Yes,' she smiled steely, 'Ramming Speed!"""

"event","....And like that all of Earth's satellite's went down. Justice and Bludgeon sat looking at blank screens. ""What the...?"" Justice blurted as Bludgeon guessed what would happen next. Turning to Justice and seeing he didn't know, Bludgeon took the initiative and tackled his commander. So dumbfounded was Justice by this action that he fell like a highschool quarterback getting sacked by a NFL pro. Bludgeon attempted to cover as much of the taller human as he could, and 'it' happened. The island shook, and dramatic sonic booms shook the base buildings.  All across the campus small machines-blew up, objects on shelves fell off. Even Blurr almost fell down.  Only one being stood there seemingly  unaffected, Marcel, the Rock. He looked to the South Eastern sky as the artificial island bucked like an untamed horse. Marcel growled, and tightened his muscles but made no other outward move. Blurr dashed over to the smaller Marcel and tried to yell over the booms, ""Marcel!  What's happening!?"" Marcel just reached out and flicked the superfast Torch away like a bothersome speck.  Blurr landed on his feet but almost fell down. ""Sheesh some people!"" Blurr whined, after warning Justice and Bludgeon he had tried to get the rest of the team to watch the broadcast. Many of the Torches were off island taking personal time. As the booms stopped slowly Blurr realized personal time was going to be called off for a while. A beeping buzz came over Blurr's Torch communicator and Justice's voice came over the frequency, ""Status report!"" Blurr being the fastest asnwered Justice first. As the other Torches responded he looked to Marcel who wasn't responding. ""Marcel?"" he asked, and an explosion of white energy was his answer as the Rock shot himself off into the sky.  Marcel was flying South East.  Atlantis was South East. Blurr ran to tell Justice where Marcel had gone.

 Marcel sensed hundreds, likely thousands of power-fighters like himself suddenly explode on to this planet. Were there Rocks amongst them? He tried to expand his senses further but that idiot Blurr began jabbering again. Rather than kill the fool, or try to fruitlessly get him to finally shut up, he decided to just fly to Atlantis and see for himself. Rocketing over the deep blue at speeds unimaginable he saw Atlantis. At these speeds, Atlantis appeared to be coming to him. Changing the arc of his flight path downward he saw numerous fires across the cities of Atlantis. That figured, power-fighters were always leveling cities using their powers. As he lighted, he watched the power-fighters flicker about.  Like an experienced brawler picking his opponent in some amd barfight, Marcel watched smiling. Though he could tell the Atlanteans and most of the Olympians couldn't see the power-fighters move most of the time, he could.  In fact most of them seemed to be moving very slowly to him. 'Slow means low power levels,' he thought dejectedly. Marcel didn't really have a hardtime justifying beating up those weaker than himself, he had just been hoping for a challenge. The wreckage of what had been a townhall behind him, presented to him his first target. Some great furry minion, 20 odd feet tall lumbered out and attacked Marcel w/ a roar. Swinging it's massive squared claws at the Rock. Marcel ducked under the swing easilly and thought of roughly 127 counters that would end this particular battle in a non-deadly fashion.  He chose none of them.  Instead he chose to show the other power-fighters that he was there. Still ducking low, he raised his left hand w/out looking to his sparring partner and placed his open palm on it's chest. The beast barely had time to look down to Marcel before a terrible torrent of energy exploded through it's chest. Marcel's blast seemed to continue, expanding, growing w/ ferocity til every last atom of the creature-man was gone. Not even a red mist rained down on him. Marcel stood up and closed his eyes smiling.  He knew he had all the power-fighters' attention now. Expanding his senses he felt where they all were and something more. He felt a very vile power. A power he hadn't sensed for close to 100 years. He opened his eyes and turned around to see a small, tailed warrior approaching him slowly. Marcel recognized, ""A SKell!"" and growled. Natural Skells, those unoccupied by Ranq lords, had no horns but where Skells skulked Ranq weren't far behind. Marcel began to sweat and wish he had come to Atlantis looking for something besides a challenge."

"event",".....no mythical beast or sorceror or fairy or god on Earth had ever seen a portal rip open that large, or that quickly. Above the tropical skies of Atlantis this portal opened. From 2 miles up to sea level on the north end of the island. Such a portal had never existed before, and was surely unthinkable but..there it was.  All portals create some light. This one glowed a fascinating yellow-white light. At the base of the aura was a black line. The black line was the outline of thousands of beings. Before any stepped through; the portal made a deep sound like a tuba and seemed to attack!  Bright white bolts of powerful energy flew out horizontally and blitzed the ancient homes of Atlantis. Most Atlanteans took cover or changed forms to become more durable. The horizontal rain of power bolts was followed by a rush of flying beings.  Not men or their races or even the beast races, no these were alien-men of all different breeds and races.  Each one flew as if propelled by a rocket and screamed their unrecognizeable battlecry as they released power bolts from their hands. Those Atlanteans that could shielded themselves or hid, those that couldn't died. Then came the ground forces. Twenty foot tall furry beings only partially clad in armor leapt hungrilly from the portal. Battle seemed to be their only wish. The ground troops swarmed out like ants from the side of a broken anthill. They waded into the Atlanteans and slew many where they stood.  Some Atlanteans lasted longer than others.  The fliers zipped deeper into the city where the remaining Olympian gods dwelled and attacked before any klaxon, signal fire, or sounding horn could be noised. The new leader of the Olympians, Brondites, attempted to rally and save his people but was quickly drawn into combat w/ a dozen flying invaders. Unleashing the mighty Vision of Baalor, Brondite cleared half of his attackers and was able to call to Ariel. ""Teleport away, warn who you can!"" Brondites shouted before a energy bolt knocked him on his face.  The young Olympian woman heard Brondites and moved to obey, w/ a sweeping gesture she....was smashed to the ground by a brown hided flying man from the side. She had never seen him attack. ""Going somewhere Witch?"" He croaked. The blow had ruined her spell of teleporting but not her will to obey her sovereign. She was stunned though and before she needed to worry about answering the grotesque warrior the wall exploded and through the dust she saw a meaty hand grasp the brown alien's neck and pull him into the dust. ""Ulp"" was the last thing she ever heard the creature speak. She cast a lesser wind spell and the dust cleared to show her distant cousin Alexi, god of wanderers, tossing her former foe onto a growing pile. ""Ha ha cousin!' He laughed to her, 'You may count that one for your own. I did not mean to steal it!"" As she tried to think of a reply she saw Alexi snatch another, a blue hided one this time,  from the sky like a wayward baseball, and w/ one blow take all the fight out of the creature. ""Alexi!' she realized he could help her and Brondites,'Your king has need of you!  Clear a space and fight your way to him!"" Alexi looked perplexed for a moment, was blasted from behind by a craven frog looking man, didn't flinch, and laughed as if he finally understood. ""I see cousin! I shall make it so!"" Alexi said whirling. Smashing his massively strong hands together in a clap and an enormous shockwave was sent his new froggy foeman flying across the floor. Ariel smiled, nothing stymied Alexi long. Hastilly she whipped up a new teleportation spell and disappeared!
In Atlantis the invasion had begun."

"event","....In the war room the Torches had erected on Torch Island, Justice sat viewing vid-screens showing the faces of America's top 12 Generals and Admirals, and one special Colonal, he was in communicae with. Bludgeon sat beside him. The Asgardian Dwarf seemed to be paying attention, and was nothing if not professional but...Justice sometimes had to wonder what his second was thinking. He realized he was daydreaming as General Schaeffer asked him for his attention.  War was no place for the Torches. They weren't built for it. Stopping tyranny no matter where it came was though. Now stuck by their credo the Torches had to help the U.S. and it's allies battle the Conquistador. ""Yes General, I heard you.  I disagree though the Torches can not be used as a spearhead in more than one local globally,"" Justice humbly replied. The Torches were the most powerful group of beings on the planet but splitting them into smaller squads destroyed their amazing efficiency. Justice and Bludgeon had come to realize this some time ago.  The Generals didn't want to hear it.  Especially Schaeffer. General Schaeffer had lost a son in the Mexican-American Vampire war and blamed the Torches. The Torches were involved in defending the planet from the Ranq, The Horde, and the Negotiator but had still managed to send a small squad to help.  It wasn't enough. The General's son had been killed regardless. Justice had heard through his contacts that the General had asked for the UN to disband the team or repeal their international charter, since they were so inept. The UN had managed to ignore General Schaeffer and the former President had told him where 'to put that rhetoric'.  Admiral Duggan spoke up, ""Justice it's naw that we don't trust ye son. Ye know yer people better than we. We have a plan, we need ye and yers to make it happen.  If our plan won't work, well then give us a new plan.""  'That was fair,' thought Justice. Though legally only a Captain by military standards, Justice now had top Generals and Admirals asking his advice.  The bad news, he had none yet.  There was far too little intel. The need to shrug and pass the buck was sorely tempting to the star spangeled hero, but he knew he couldn't. And he knew the Commanders wouldn't let him 'think on it'. He tried to keep his face blank. The lone Colonol on the screens, Combat, seemed to read Justice's silence and spoke. ""Generals, Admirals, good sense suggests we attack while the window of opportunity is still open. We don't even know if the window 'is' still open. We need hard data we don't have."" General Graham of the Marines snorted, ""Where we s'posed to get said intel? The Toothfairy?  Cuz I put mah damn dentures under mah pillow all week and de dirty bitch didn't give me even a quarter let alone an easy way to beat the Conk! You sure as shit aint got any.""  Conk was the military's term for the Conquistador, a codename for a codename. Combat knew all the Generals and Admirals on a nearly personal basis, he'd told his fair share to go to hell.  He wasn't surprized by Graham's boorish attempt at sarcasm. ""Graham, only the English have hard data. I am doing all I can.  Until you do 'anything' why don't you let the adults talk?"" Combat replied. Graham's face on his screen turned red and had to be muted and eventually turned off by a Torch technician w/ the excuse of 'Technical difficulties'. 'One down,' Combat thought. ""The English have shared w/ us all they have. Apparently the Conq is reshaping Europe and has dropped a new Iron Curtain so we won't see the show til he says so,"" Combat said to catch any of the military leaders up. Admiral Brahg queried, ""So what you're saying is not only the most dangerous psychopathic scientific mind known to existence changing the game, he is playing a shell game as well?""  Justice thought that was an apt description, two week old intel was just that now, two weeks too old. Bludgeon seemed to come to life and leaned forward, ""Gennelman wha' we 'ave here is a very tentative situation.  In the last battle the Conk let all retreating forces retreat. 'Let'.  Something to keep in mind. The Conk is not known for his generosity but instead his gestures."" General Ostermeiller was the youngest of the assembled commanders, and the highest ranked female officer in any of the armed forces, ""So..what can we do?"" She asked of Bludgeon and Justice. Justice looked to Bludgeon a trace of worry on his face, Bludgeon just looked determined. Bludgeon answered, ""Nothing, there is naught to be done yet."" That seemed to take the winds from the associated commanders' sails. A light in the war room flashed and the super-fast Torch known as Blurr ran in. ""Justice, Bludgeon change the channel you got to see this!""  Blurr ignored the military commanders and shut off their acess. Flipping a few switches he changed the view of those screens to one large screen like a jumbotron. Only Justice and Bludgeon didn't cheer for what they saw."

For more than 5 minutes he lay on the floor holding his head as it were trying to split apart.  The only way to fight this pain was to ignore his natural power of Chronopathy. He was literally a psychic who could read any language, break any code, and see the future up to five minutes ahead.  Now he had to block himself, turn off those powers to even see straight. At first all he had seen was white. When he saw white he knew something absolutely Horrible was about to happen. He had seen white. That meant something so horrible it could take place in excess of 5 minutes could happen.  Yes his powers were that haphazard.  Sometimes he'd see white and nothing would happen. 99% of the time though...Ok whether it hurt or not he had to see.  he might have to warn people. Usually when he saw white he had to warn the whole world.  He tried sitting up, the chair wouldn't let him so he rolled as nimbly to the side as he could. not meaning to he groaned, his head hurt really bad and he hadn't even started using his powers intentionally yet.  He must have hit his head when he fell over. Great. Shaking out his arms to relax his muscles some, Enigma took a meditation posture. Now to try and relax his mind. The 6'5"" mutant was built like a body builder, had the soul of a poet, and psionic abilities that could make him a god if he wasn't so scrupulous. There was a time as a youth he had used his powers to stay alive. Betting was always a good way to pick up enough change to eat for a while. Remembering those hard times helped him to relax and ignore his powers long enough to stabalize his will. With his willpower under complete control now he could dare look into the 'white'.  Enigma had never not looked, he wasn't about to start now. W/ a deep inhalation of breath he released his psionic shielding and stopped ignoring his powers. He hoped half a second beore the rush of white began that the white wouldn't consume him again. Another half a second later the white consumed him."

"event","The Spellgrabber was the fastest, strongest ship in existence. It was so large it had no projectile or energy weapons. It had no need for them. Black Hole was the owner and master of said ship yet he could find no comfort in it. The Spellgrabber looked like a gigantic Earth crab w/ a domed city on it's back. The cosmic being known as Black Hole stared through the nearly impervious, semi-transparent that was used as the dome and wondered. Certainly Wontin had offered a lot of money to rejoin Ramadvor in his conquest of Earth, but why really was he going back?  He had suffered his most major losses, including his life once, there. Why return?  The money?  No Black Hole had a feeling he could have asked Wontin for twice as much and he'd have paid. Conquest?  No he and the Horde regularilly conquered other planets. For revenge? No he could have had his revenge a thousand times over already. For glory?  Maybe.  There were beings on the planet that not only could injure him but might be able to kill him. Black Hole was over 10,000 years old. He had seen the fabric of the universe tear and heal. Was he really that in love w/ danger and combat?  He had even joined the Earth heroes, the Torches, at one point. Even earning enough of their trust to become a squad leader.  Too many times he was restrained by some 'law' or 'rule' of the team. That was no way to force your will on others...rules and laws. Paperwork, that's all rules and laws were, unless he made them. No to Black Hole only force could argue w/ force. So Black Hole had tried to take leadership of the Torches by force.  His force was met and he had left before he could be drummed out and arrested.  'Pathetic fools', he remembered. If only they had done things his way, then Ramadvor would never have raised the island of Atlantis and Earth would be safe. Now for their folly Ramadvor was returning and Black Hole's Horde was w/ them. Who knew what powers or allies Ramadvor had with him. Success was practically guaranteed. Maybe it was just revenge. He did want to see the look on the Torches' faces when he returned w/ his old team and helped the Ranq conquer their planet. He smiled lightly. Black Hole sensed a life form approaching him, he turned to see the crystalline being, Prism his spawn-daughter, drop from the air and land. ""Father!"" The way she said it always made it sound like a salute or a compliment.  ""Yes my dear daughter...what is it?"" he asked. She was the only being in the universe he truelly trusted. ""We shall be in orbit of Earth's moon in 15 minutes."" She updated him. ""How should we approach?""  Black Hole didn't like to use the same tricks twice no matter how well they worked. He had come to Earth and had the Spellgrabber barely touch the planet's outer atmospheres.  That had caused some chaos to the world's weather and gravities. He had come to Earth and moved it's moon so it was in it's strongest phase of the full moon. That had caused some chaos as well.  Between the werebeasts and the Leviathan, it had been some time before the Torches could get around to fighting the Horde.  That had worked well but it was done. He looked to his shapely, prismatic daughter and asked,  ""What would you suggest?"" Not having to think too long for an answer Prism responded, ""Come in hard and fast, whip around Sol, let the resulting solar flares  ruin their long range probes for a few weeks. While they are blinded, teleport to our point of attack..and blitz our foes!""  Black Hole was always glad he hadn't killed Prism like he had his previous Spawns, now he almost overwhelmed w/ pride for her. ""An excellent idea my dear,"" Black Hole purred. It was almost as good as something he might have made up. Prism flew off to make it so. She never needed to be baby-sat or herded about like most of the lunatic and maniacs on the team. She was the most competent person on the team besides himself. If he fell, ths trip to Earth...she would make a worthy successor to him. In less than minutes the fight of their lives would begin. Pure cosmic force and bloodlust versus the True Technology of the Conquistador. Black Hole relished the thought."

"event","...several galaxies away a starship headed silently toward the same target as the Nefarians. Inside it's occupants shoved and jostled amongst themselves. Though the starship, the Necromancer, was immense the Pa'dox were packed together, and shoving was not a wholly unfavorable way to waste time.  The 7 ft to 8ft tall aliens wore the blackened leather hides of their fallen foes. Not only did the brutes believe that eating their enemies increased their strength but humans were damned tasty. Inactivity and close quarters could lead to murderous mutinies if a commander tried to enforce too much discipline. Kovar was satisfied w/ the minimal level of horseplay. He was also glad he had only lost 24 people in the trip here through murderous accidents. That was a fairly low number for so large a crew. Too try to hold back his people too much would mean they would jezelt or start to burn up from inactivity. Their own immense energies made them shove and fidget constantly except after a major battle. Kovar expected a major battle on Earth. A smile shone in the worn Captain's remaining eye and his skin shone a special silver. Yes Kovar expected quite a battle.  He liked food that fought back.

   Behind him 10 million Pa'dox soldiers growled, wrestled, and shoved relatively quietly. Kovar was beginning to think changing his deity from 'Paradox, the All-holder' to 'Lokatnin', the Underworlder' had been for the best. So far his fortunes had been nothing but golden. A lieutenant handed Kovar a data sheath on his left side.  Kovar growled at the officer who immedeitely bowed and crawled away.  Kovar did not like being approached on his blindside. He had told his officers but so strong was he that they doubted any fear or weakness in him. If a peon soldier had approached him on the left, that peon would be ritualistically killed in front of the others as an example. Kovar knew his officers just needed a reminding of his utter dominance. The ritual was now complete. Kovar looked to the data sheeth and organized the calculations. Less than 2 million of his own troops were expected to die. 'Pretty good odds those,' he thought to himself.  11 million humans would be killed. Of those nearly half would be ruined. Ruined meaning made not worth eating. Half...that was a lot to be ruined. Of those left he and his could pick and chose which humans to take with. What a glorious feast. His people had not ate in nigh-30 Earth days.  Not a very long time but long enough to be hungry. Kovar had once gone 2 years w/out a morsel of flesh.  That was a long time. Over half of Kovar's troops weren't 2. Less than 10% were more than 10.  Kovar himself was the oldest on board at 145. A 145 good years. Kovar looked down to his scar-laden arms and hands. Even his talons appeared to have scars, he mused. His leathers were in tatters from killing an upstart.  This trip he would make himself a new suit. A fine suit. A suit worthy of a Captain. Yes this coming battle would be profitable and glorious."

"event","..The Nefarians stood on the teleportation deck waiting for their commander and his bogyguard to arrive. Many of the Nefarians were excited.  Blood and conquest for the sake of blood and conquest were rare enough treasures but this time their leader, Pyrat, had promised they would be paid for this endeavor. One of the winged Nefarians known as Vectorwing, fidgeted abit more than his robotic brethren.  Although not much taller than the average Nefarian he needed to make a  bigger impression than the rest. None of the Nefarians were overly worried of dieng. The threat the Earthlings presented, even their superhumans, was minimal. Akin to a human fighting a small canine, no contest really. No Vectorwing was suffering performance anxiety. Not so much nervousness, but a promise made to him by Pyrat. Pyrat had heard all about Vectorwing and had taken the cunning former air commander aside to advise him. ""In the coming battle i will expect alot from all of my Nefarians. Even more from my flyers. From you I will expect twice as much.  From you I will expect twice as large a headcount, twice as large a rubble mound, and twice the resources razed. If you do not, if you turn tail or hide....I will personally deactivate you and sell your slag to Evil Robert.' Pyrat finished w/ a smile, 'That is my promise to you. Please tell me if in anyway I am unclear."" As he lifted his massive plasma cannon, Vectorwing had had the strength of mind to barely stutter out, ""Of course mighty Pyrat..wha..whatever you wish!""  Typically Vectorwing would feel foolish being cowed by any robot, he fancied himself as very brave though he wasn't, but he knew Pyrat would kill him in the flash of a mircon. Pyrat wasn't like former Nefarian commander who suffered fools just to keep the ranks of their army and armada full. Pyrat was entirely too logical for Vectorwing's taste. He liked his commanders more foolish, more emotional. True Pyrat was a sadistic freak who enjoyed destroying friend as much as foe, and Vectorwing could respect that but he didn't wish to be on the 'to-be-slagged' list. Nervously, Vectorwing scratched the armored paneling on his left arm. Another winged Nefarian, Strafe, good naturedly hit Vectorwing in the shoulder. ""You look nervous Rocket-bait,"" he taunted the 27 foot tall robot. Vectorwing reeled back w/ his right arm and smashed Strafe right in his faceplate sending the slightly smaller robot to the floor headfirst. ""Nervous? Me? You skizzy excuse for a morpnal! How dare you?! What you see in the magnificence that is me, is bold, murderous, anxiousness! And if anyone has a problem w/ that they need to speak up now!"" Finishing by leveling his twin upperarm vector cannons at the assembled group had the desired reaction....stonecold silence.  That silence always made Vectorwing feel respected. As Strafe kelped himself back his feet a very small, almost human sized Nefarian barked, ""Commander on DECK!"" As a large door slid open and then entered Pyrat and Chronalcannon. All including the few officers in this army came to attention. Pyrat was the more armored, and stronger of the two but Chronalcannon looked deadlier. It was hard for Chronalcannon not to look dangerous, with one Chronal gun mounted on his shoulder and another always close at hand. He was the walking mechanical version of the term, ""Prepared for anything"". Pyrat looked down toward his troops readying to speak. ""My fellow Nefarians In 2 hours we shall indulge in the type of slaughter all Nefarian commanders promise but few deliver!  Like a plague we shall destroy all life in our way and take what we like from lesser beings!  Besides the pay I promised you,'Pyrat took a moment to smile at his troops. ""you will be allowed to keep all and any loot or resources you can take.""  The Nefarians had heard this information before but most were so slow-witted that they cheered as if hearing it for the first time.  Pyrat's smile grew, dim-witted troops tended to obey orders better. ""Steel yourselves my warriors, for in mere hours we paint New York city red w/ the blood of it's citizens!""  The roar of approval from the crowd almost surprized Pyrat and his smile grew."

"event","Wontin suddenly knew how lesser races felt in close proximity to the might the presence of a Ranq represented. He was glad he prevented his host body from shuddering instinctively. Ramadin could stand safely beside his father knowing his parent loved and treasured him. Wontin knew he had no such guaranty and worried. At a guess he figured his host body could raise it's power level to the max and be less than 1/10th as powerful as Ramadvor's resting host body. Unable to stop the shiver that rippled through his host body, Wontin felt it too and it felt right. Ramadvor wasn't known to destroy assets...or people but then again he wasn't known to go to war either. And Ramadvor was very distinctly going to war. War, Wontin understood. He didn't know why Ramadvor didn't just engineer a virus to destroy the Earth's population or cast Armageddon on the useless blue orb. No that was incorrect, in truth Wontin knew. Ramadvor wanted slaves. It was how he had accrued his massive wealth and influence. Slaves were a fine business for those w/ a flare for selling. But Wontin was no salesman. Wontin knew what he was. He was a go-to, eyes-down, head-up general. Conquest and success stood on the backs of the defeated and the defeated didn't have to live through the experience. Ramadvor risked killing half the slaves he wished from Earth but he seemed ok w/ that estimate, Wontin was no longer in a position to argue the point. 100 years wasn't a longtime to the nearly eternal Ranq but time passing could seem to take forever. Wontin had a goal. He would get a Rock hybrid pup in 100 years from Ramadvor and conquer the rest of this universe, and maybe a few others. Yes, he had a goal and that made all the difference. He could suffer anything to attain his goals. Wontin's antlers itched just thinking of the power that would soon be his. His host body's antlers always reacted to power by itching. It was one of the reasons most Ranq chose this race, the Skells. They could detect power. That and the massive amounts of power the bodies could hold. One could argue the abilities of the body were not mean either. The Skells could naturally survive in the vaccum of space, manipulate massive amounts of power to use as blasts or speed, and their strength was phenominal. The tail and antlers came in handy from time to time as well. It always amazed Wontin how many ignorant beings truelly believed the Skell's 4 foot long tail actually was a penis. Too many backwards races relied or believed in phallic power, but by and large the illusion had worked 'for' the Ranq. 'Until now,'Wontin thought. 'If Ramadvor sells Rock hybrid pups to other Ranq...before I get one...' The conclusions he came to were disasterous. Before the body switch Wontin and Ramadvor had been friendly rivals, possibly even siblings. Neither could remember, they were so old. Ramadvor had pursued money and property through shrewd business deals. Wontin had built the greatest army any Splugorth ever heard of. Both conquered, both were highly successful. In fact both had bragged of similar power levels...until Ramadvor had won that game of chance. Now Wontin was the servant and Ramadvor held him in his mercy. Wontin knew Ramadvor well enough that he had best keep his old rival busy or Ramadvor might consider breeding his host body.....and that would do Wontin no good. This war would be a good distraction. He hoped."

"event","....After America's recent defeat at the hands of the Conquistador in Europe, America's top generals hunkered down and began plotting their next move. The Spanish dictator had not only spanked the U.N. united forces but let them go. In the meantime unknown to all the Earthlings, 106 Techno-Wizard space ships slipped into orbit around the chaotic blue mudball. Ramadvor and his son, Ramadin, stood on the bridge of his luxury battle cruiser amongst the small armada. ""Father...Do we wait for Wontin?"" Ramadin asked in referrance to his father's general and newest servant. ""I don't think so. I feel...he shall be with us shortly,"" smiling and reveling in his new power level. ""You can feel him from here?"" Ramadin asked in surprize. Wontin was several galaxies away, surely to far to feel. ""Yes my son, this new body's power far exceeds my own..I don't even have to try now..it is quite like I can feel everyone in the universe now."" Even Ramadvor was astounded. Ramadin's estimation of his father rose even more. None of the Ranq had thought the body of a flesh creature could be so powerful. The Ranq were by and large inter-dimensional body thieves. Unable to keep a cohesive form in normal dimensions, they expanded their conciousness and power into powerful bodies in dimensions they couldn't physically enter. No flesh body, not even that of a god was as powerful as Ramadvor's latest transport. And to think Ramadvor only had this body because he won a game of chance against Wontin. Upon losing and desperately wishing the power of the body, Wontin had made a deal. The children of the Rock people were known to be even more powerful than their parents....when one of their parents was a human. A hybrid. Wontin swore his servitude for a century in return for payment of a Rock hybrid child body. Wontin was an incredible general, if bad game player, and Ramadvor had taken the offer on the spot. Wontin's army was ruthless, varied, well seasoned, and highly successful. Wontin's record was 14965464/255. The numbers might be less than perfect but no Ranq held a record even remotely close. That meant Ramadvor was in control of the Ranq's greatest general and army for the next 100 years. After losing Atlantis to the True Atlanteans and their human allies the Torches, Ramadvor had lost his taste for blood and conflict. This new super-Rock body brought back war's flavor to the businessman. Smiling he looked down on the only planet to ever spurn him twice and he felt comfortable. With the massive amount of casualties his forces were about to create. Ramadvor always preferred to let the slave stock keep large numbers but sometimes one had to thin the herd. Besides in a century or 2 the population of the Earth would return somewhat. Wontin appeared on the bridge to the left of Ramadvor and Ramadin in a flash of teleportational light, he immediately took a knee out of respect. Without looking Ramadvor welcomed his newest servant. Ramadin was surprized yet again, he hadn't even felt the warlord appear and yet his father didn't even need to look. His father was very strong indeed. ""My lord,' Wontin rose saluting Ramadvor, 'I bring news and good tidings."" Ramadvor smiled greater. He loved hearing that good news was afoot. ""Speak honored general,""he bid Wontin. Wontin's host body coughed, uncomfortable w/ being a servant. ""Both the Horde and the Nefarians have agreed to join our fight, and have agreed to the plan I developed for you."" Wontin took no small delight or pride in his military prowess.""Furthermore my liege the Pa'dox, Chronux, Do'lan, and Kriell have agreed to your terms of an alliance!"" Wontin spat joyously. ""Good my general. Very soon we shall stop this human war and take back this planet that rightfully belongs to me!"" Ramadvor clasped his hands together before him w/ such speed(and force) that the technician working on the monitoring device 12 feet before him exploded into a liquid form. Both Ramadin and Wontin leapt back reflexively. Neither had seen Ramadvor move."

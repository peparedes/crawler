"event","&nbsp; haha it was a funny picture (refer to mrskohspeaks&nbsp;5th April post picture) this might be a short post as i don't have a lot of time.

the first time i notice funny about the picture was that it was meant to tell that everyone could use it, meaning women, man, disabled and even babies! that was a first notice&nbsp;everytime&nbsp;i looked at it. after that, i gave myself a good 10 seconds to look careful at the picture, and i finally found out what was so weird. ;)

have you noticed that the word 'restroom' below the picture has a arrow at the left pointing to the left. however, all the people in the picture on top of the words are walking to the right! haha! that was funny and i was laughing abit...

if there's is anything i notice from the picture, like any extra points i'll add it in yeah? take care all u people!

"event","&nbsp;hm.. this one have to think 'cause there are many. firstly, i don't know whether it is related to english lesson or not. but still, i'll try my best to find a memory for this one.... ... ... ah ha! got it ;) i wouldn't take this as a memory to remember, but it was&nbsp;a lesson i found fun. 

it was during English when we are all in groups and&nbsp;Mr Chiang (The Arthur Elfin One) was teaching us formal letter writing. firstly, let me tell you my first impression of Mr Arthur Elfin Chiang (unique full name XD). i know it's staining from the point but spare me a minute for me to pour out my funny weird impression of him. :D 

when i saw him walk into the class, he looks like a relatively medium, no glasses, works out kinda teacher. not very teacher-like. (If Mrs Koh or Mr Chiang or any other teacher is reading this... pls don't take it as an insult ok??? i'm too young to be humiliated... T_T) but still he looked OKAY. 

also, haha one funny thing to remember about him was when MY PARENTS SAW HIM. it was during the Teacher and Paretn Meeting. we just so happen to be walking to my class and saw him outside the general office. when my parents saw him, they were immediately asking me who was that teacher, plus they didn't know he was teaching me! when i explained to them, they said ""oh... he looks like a computer geek kinda guy."" (PLSPLSPLSPLS DON'T USE THIS TO TORTURE ME DURING ENGLISH CLASS) i was kinda shock at our different views when my parents and i met him. but still, funny XD. 

oh and he taught my sister too. (she just graduated last yr) she said he was a very fun and unique teachers and i got a very good teach that i should cherish... so yeah... 

BACK TO THE POINT OF INFORMATION (hehe) he got this laptop (REALLY SUPER&nbsp;AWESOME ONE&nbsp;THAT I'VE WANTED FOR A SO LONG TIMEEEEEEEEE) and show us a powerpoint&nbsp; on how to write formal letters and what not to write on it. i found it nice as it was a group work i liked to do and we had kinda alot of fun."

"event","&nbsp; here are my comments on the debate held during EL/MRL week :)

it was pretty okay i guess... it was quite challenging as our opponents a.k.a BOYS were quite smart in their answers. i had lots of fun as it was a good outside the classroom experience. it was quite funny to see our classmates trying to argue and see who was&nbsp;the better speaker giving the better points.

if anyone unrelated to the event would wanna know, here some information on the debate:

Teams : Boys VS Girls
Motion : There should be more PW rather than Exams
Opp. : Girls
Prop. : Boys
Outcome of debate : --
Prize : --&nbsp;

that's mainly about roughly what the debate was about. we had it at the DnT block by the way :) and also it was quite cool as when we were near the finish, 2G came out from the DnT workshop on the second level and they listened to our debate for a short while. so it was kind of like a very small and very short while audience.&nbsp;

my reflections was that overall, the debate was a fun and enjoyable&nbsp;'trip' outside of the classrooms. i hope to have more activities 'cause it sure beats staying in class listening to the teacher and reading our textbooks ;D

"event","i went for a trip just right after&nbsp;christmas.

on the 26th Dec, my family and I went for a 2D 1N trip to malaysia. we walked&nbsp;from woodlands&nbsp;to malaysia. it was pretty cool though. then we&nbsp;went to catch a movie and go shopping. my Mum and I watched Alvin and The ChipMunks while my sister&nbsp;, dad and&nbsp;brother&nbsp;watched I Am Legend. we went to the hotel at 12.15 to take a rest. then we went out at 6.30 for dinner and more shopping. the hotel was pretty cool. it was the first time i got a good night sleep in a hotel.

on the second day, my mum, sis and I went for a haircut. my sister changed the fringe. my haircut was something i didn't like... the haircut was too short, so next time i go out, i'll wear beanie. the way back home was alright. my brother went to sleep on the train and stepped on everyone's foot.

i think that's all, at the end i enjoyed myself in the holidays"

"event","although this happened a long time ago, i felt that i should tell you.

i had a reunion class outing&nbsp;with some&nbsp;of my primary 6 classmates.

i was also very happy and excited. before the thing happened, i went to play basketball with a friend of mine also going for the outing. we playing till 10.30a.m. and left. we were together till Pasir Ris MRT station. little did i know that i was about to be the only girl with 4 roudy, ill-disiplined boys. they were all clueless on how to get there. when we took a bus we stopped at the bus stop and got down. they looked at each other waiting for one to lead the way. i frowned and ignored them and headed my way&nbsp;to my friend's house. they followed&nbsp;me exchanging their own remarks.&nbsp;we walked all the way there. at the house, we met the rest of the gang and sat near the pool&nbsp;and ate. i pitied my friend as she tried to tell the boys rules. however, they didn't listen.

after that, we went to&nbsp;Pasir Ris Park. that was when i made&nbsp;the day bad for everyone.&nbsp;they persuaded me to rent a bike and ride it with them although i didn't&nbsp;know how to. they taught me but it was harder than i thought. at the end, we went to the playground. i rode a two-seater bike with a friend. although the bike was too small for her, my friend manage to ride there. we met with another two girls and one guy on the way there and over there as well.&nbsp;then, on the way back, i decided to push my bike back. i was holding on the receipt when i lost it! i took over 30 minutes to find it but it was lost. i was so sad and worried that i was about to cry. i had let all my friends down terribly. at the end, i helped her pay for the extra, which was a total of $11.

then we went back to her house and sat there and made funny videos and also did our own things. at the end we went back home together and it was the best yet worst&nbsp;day of my life!

"event","<p>I'm sure that everyone always look forward to a break from work and school! well, this is one activity i did during the holidays.<br /><br />On the 19/11/07,&nbsp;I had my first secondary school senior farewell party.&nbsp;I was one of the proud few to be in charge of&nbsp;buying two&nbsp;1.5L drinks and also my first planned treasure hunt-cum-game station. we were given an hour and 15 minutes. On sunday night,&nbsp;I hurriedly made the score cards, the clues, the items to find and also the items my own game station needed.&nbsp;I was so elated at the job&nbsp;I had done by hand. My dad did not allow me to print anything out.&nbsp;I worked the whole night and in the morning. i met the rest of my fellow ICs at McDonalds and we planned the thing. at the same time, i totally forgot about the drinks.<br /><br />when we all went to school, i looked at the drinks the others had bought. i froze in horror and ran to the nearest shop to buy the drinks. once i came back with my friend, we had to wait in the choir room. while Mr Shahril was confirming the whole plan with us, two familiar faces popped out from the window. the first two seniors! Mr Shahril signaled us to go now as the two seniors went in.<br /><br />all was well and we could only set up our game stalls after lunch, while everyone was busy playing a game. when the seniors went in, we burst some balloons and confetti went all on them. we were all having a blast. we played the first game, which was understand the senior and juniors. we won due to the rule that 'every senior is 5 juniors'. sadly, my question wasn't picked as many juniors would have known that the answer would be Fall out boy or Patrick Stump. nevertheless, it was fun.<br /><br />we went out for lunch and i ate at McDonalds. after that, that was when it was time to set up our game stall.<br /><br />the first was managed by two people. it was the normal vesrion of the 'spider web' game. we wanted to put tooth paste and things on it but we couldn't as many weren't willing to sacrifice their shirts. the second was done by another&nbsp;two people. what the group had to do was one by one go to a bucket full of ice and put their hand in there to reach for a utensil. then, they had to go to a bowl of ice cream to eat it. the ice cream had melted but still they had to eat it. mine was next. they would pick an alphabet and a number. then they had to name and write down the number of things that start with that alphabet. the last was a bonus stage. all the stations were to assign the groups a pink slip and find items on it. i was&nbsp;running all over the place helping the teams set up&nbsp;the stall&nbsp;or checking to see if they were done. also, i had to run to tell them that the game was going to start.&nbsp;although i wasn't in charge, i tried my best to make this&nbsp;game a huge success!&nbsp;( :) )<br /><br />to my worst horror, it was a HUGE flop. each station was giving 15 minutes to play and there was six groups. i was wrong of me to think that there would be alot of people in a group. in fact, at the end there was only 3 per group. every group played the game and finished in less than 3 minutes. the first was done in less than that and&nbsp;the second was so messy and they had to clean up. the third, mine was very short and the bonus lasted&nbsp;less than 10&nbsp;minutes. i was disappointed at myself.<br /><br />at the end, we gave out prizes and everyone received something. the sweet packet we had bought for the first and second team turned out to be too much. but overall, i was happy.<br /><br />i managed to gather a senior's opinion of the game. he said it was too short and we should have planned it better. despite that, he said it was kind of great as my first IC of game. i was really determined to try harder if there was a next time<br /><br />we had a huge BBQ which there were only a few of the seniors that came. i ate alot of satays and chicken breast kebab. my friend talked me into trying the minty kebab and i had to refill my drink many times! i had to admit, i'm not much of a spicy person.<br /><br />we gathered in a circle and answered&nbsp;four questions:<br />1) Name<br />2) Hobby<br />3) What was your most favourite memory in choir<br />4) What you would like to see the choir as in 10 years<br /><br />i forgot to say that my hobby was listening to fall out boy and i'm utterly sad... however, the whole party was great and was the best i had ever been to.<br /><br />me &gt; blessings &gt; u<br />cla338<br />falloutboy'sno.1fan!!!</p>"

( the first is later... ) XD He's also a really funny guy and&nbsp;the only fault he has&nbsp;is he smokes pot and drinks and has alot of tatoos...<br />&nbsp; The 2nd most beautiful thing in the world is&nbsp;<font color=""#ff0000"">PETE WENTZ</font> from <font color=""#ff0000"">Fall Out&nbsp;Boy</font>!!!

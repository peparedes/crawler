"event","My new Dell laptop is up and running - I had to change the order to an Expresso Brown cover instead of a Blossom Pink (with flowers) or else it would have been another month.

Kyle and I have been busy at the studio working on Blake's 1st Year slideshow. We recorded just over 3 hours of raw audio (us talking to Blake about the pregnancy and his first year, etc.), chose 312 pictures and put it all together in a slideshow with background music and the whole works. (Of course, we didn't use all 3 hours of the raw audio - just clips to tell the story and complement the slideshow. We'll put together an AudioScrapbook to include all the important stuff that didn't make it to the slideshow.) Once it's totally finished, I'll post YouTube clips of it for your enjoyment. All we have left to do with it today is to add the audio track to the slideshow and burn the CDs. :D :D :D

To mail these out (to family & close friends), I made thank you cards for Blake's birthday.

Untie the ribbons to find Blake's hand print. I wasn't sure how the gel finger paints were going to work out, so I used construction paper - only because I knew it wasn't going to directly touch the picture on the front. Kudos to Crayola: all of their stuff is non-toxic and the finger paints are completely washable. They washed off Blake easily, off the plate we used as his pallette, AND off the high chair cover when I did nothing but throw it into the wash. :D Also - if you're wondering - the gel paints don't taste too good either. B stuck his paint-covered fingers in his mouth once, spat that out and didn't try it again.

Open the card and see I got to use my new Cricut tool! :D

These were made using 12x12 cardstock for the base card, ribbon, construction paper and gel finger paints (handprint), cardstock for the panels, rubber stamps, embossing markers, embossing powder, heat embossing, and quilting thread (on my sewing machine)."

"event","My laptop totolly died last week.... Hopefully our IT guy at work will be able to recover all my pictures. If not, I'll be ordering CDs of everything I've ever uploaded to snapfish.com ....and mourn the loss of about a month's worth of pictures. *sigh* Guess it could be worse, much worse.

I've ordered a new laptop from Dell, but since I just had to have the pink blossom design it won't ship out until mid-October. *sigh* What's a girl to do? Get off the computer and into the studio to make new cards? Oh yeah! Prints to make B's birthday invites should be coming in the mail very soon. The invites will actually just be a formality (with an audio slideshow) sent right before his birthday. Note to self: schedule studio time to record B's 1st year commentary."

"event","I have made 3 quilts so far this year (this summer)! Of course, they aren't my typical puff quilts.... I figured that I'd drive myself batty trying to finish puff quilts, be a mom and work full-time. The first quilt was a small and simple one for Charlie. I had been looking for some good material to make Charlie a quilt and my mom talked me into (not that she had to try hard) getting this material. Instead of doing squares (as I usually do), the front is has a quilted ""look"" / pattern.

I chose a fairly simple and dark material for the back - I like stuff that doesn't show dirt very much, so you won't ever see much white in the quilts I make. I trimmed it with an ""I Love Puppies"" print....

"event","Thank you to everyone that stopped by <a href=""http://www.bluetowerstudio.com"">Blue Tower's</a> open house last Saturday!

The RiNo open house turned out great. Blake was there and did well. *whispers* He actually took a 2 hour nap at the studio! We were pretty much busy the entire day with people coming and going. Kyle found that recording 3 different artists (<a href=""http://www.joshrael.com"">Josh Rael</a>, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/joeforothin"">Tyler Bills</a>, and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/tiffanycarryne1"">Tiffany Carryne</a>) throughout the day actually kept his ears really fresh and kept him sharp. Needless to say, with all the bustle, I didn't get any new cards made during the open house. That's okay though.

Wednesday night <a href=""http://www.mcboatphotography.com"">Greg McBoat</a> did a fashion shoot at the studio for Adam van Eeckhout's new designs. They actually used mostly the outside of the building and one of the huge vacant spaces in the building...and our rooms for changing & prep. It was really cool. (Plus we got to see Greg, Meka & Adam.) Kyle didn't have any work that he could get done (the red room was off limits for the evening). So he took care of B while I worked on new thank you cards. I brought home the front designs to try out sewing on them. Of course this means I'll have to pull my machine out. I hope it works. I've seen a lot of people using the sewing / stitching techniques and I love the look!"

"event","Blake's baptism weekend has been fabulous! Our parents are still in town, but I've found a little bit of time to post what we gave our moms for Mother's Day. I couldn't decide which one to give to who, so I had Kyle wrap them with the cards inside.

The page my mom got is a white 12x12 with polka dotted, green and a dusty blue paper. The ribbon is a bright pea green. It is decorated with colored brads, has a sticker title of ""blake"" and is stamped with ""Happy Mother's Day"". Along the edge of the polka dot paper I wrote ""Mom"" and ""Grandma"" repeatedly and added colored brads.

A flower and ""Happy Mother's Day"" is stamped in the corner with the same blue ink and is titled ""Blake"" with stickers. Along the edge of the striped paper I wrote "" * Mom * Grandma * Mom * ..."" in silver.

"event","This is the card I sent for April's <lj user=cardswap> challenge. The theme was weather. I wanted to do a rubber ducky & rain drops - but I'm still having a hard time finding rubber duckies that I like. I just may have to break down one of these days and get a Cricut or some other die cut machine.

But for now, I give you a Christmas snowflake in April - kind of like the weather in Colorado lately. ""Merry Christmas"" is embossed in silver and there is a rhinestone in the middle of the snowflake eyelet. The Peace snowflake is on a raised box and has embossed glitter in the middle of it.

We've moved into a new apartment and we're getting ready for the RiNo (River North Art District) open house in May... so to say we've been busy lately is an understatement. I could probably count on one hand how many times we've gotten down to the studio this month - including the 2 days Kyle had Julia and Melissa in the studio for Career Day.

Anyways, my business cards and magnets came! (My first official mail in the new place.) Let me know if you'd like me to send you one or some. Also - we have postcards and field guides for the RiNo open house, May 17th. I can get you those too. We will be collecting CDs & DVDs to recycle, have 3 artists in doing recording demonstrations, and open mic time. (I'll also have my cards out to sell.)"

Palm Sunday we finally recorded Steph's grandma for her audio scrapbook. We went down to do it in December, but Kyle couldn't get the input to record. There were some settings that he had to redo in the Layla software. We think his former partner, reloaded everything on the laptop to clear all of his personal stuff off when they split....and it defaulted to these settings that were wrong. *shrug* Embarrassing, but at least we were with friends. Lesson learned: always make sure EVERYTHING is working properly before going out for a job. Since the first try life has been absolutely crazy with both of my grandparents passing, our trip to Hawaii, me working out of town for 3 weeks, and just trying to get back into a normal life. *LOL* Did I say ""normal"", I meant back into a groove.

Back to recording Grandma Ruby.... I wish we would have been able to record all the small talk and stories she told back in December while Kyle was trying to get the Layla work work. *L* She was so relaxed...and that makes for the best recordings. The other Sunday we were finally able to give it another go. This time she was prepared with notes on what she wanted to <strike>read</strike> talk about. Steph's mom and I entertained Blake in the other room, but he was having a ball laughing and babbling - which was consequently caught on tape. Kyle was editing the tape yesterday and another interesting thing is that he kept finding airplanes in the tape. We didn't even notice them when we were recording! So we wonder if Steph's mom lives right under an airpath. It reminded me of one of Dr. Deyo's experiments where the mice were freaking out at night. He did an audio recording overnight and found that there were bats in the attic that were creating noises that the human ear couldn't hear, but the mice could. I think Kyle was able to edit a lot of airplanes out - as well as several of B's screaches. But Grandma and Steph were hoping that he left some of B's babblings in because it was ""so cute"". Lesson learned: when doing this professionally, B will have to stay home.

I can't wait to hear the final version of Grandma Ruby's audio scrapbook! (Actually, I haven't heard any of it yet.) We think we'll give them a copy of the original recording and the final version. When asked what kind of music she likes - because Kyle will put in background music - Grandma replied ""Oh...how about some Glen Miller."" *smiles* Done. One of my faves. :D On the way home from the studio last night I had an inspiration. So I think I'll make a 12x12 scrapbook page for Steph to go with the audio scrapbook. Of course, I will have to take a listen first so that it can be tailored to Grandma's stories. So excited!

We're still looking to do more of these audio scrapbooks for free to build our AudioMemories portfolio. So if you or someone you know would be interested, let me know."

The challenge for the <lj user=cardswap> community this month was either ""Girly Girl"" or black & orange. I chose girly girl, of course. For the other girly girl card I picked up some rhinestone martini stickers. I'm excited to get them sent out. Unfortunately, sending them out will have to wait until Friday - since I'm out of town for work this week. Likewise, posting pictures of the new creations will have to wait as well. Besides the girly girl cards, I also attempted something a little more boyish for thank you cards and a birthday card for my brother.

I wish I had more time before Valentine's Day to make more of the Girly Girl Flowers. I'll be lucky to finish making cookies before we leave on vacation next Monday.

Kyle also started to put together a demo for a project supporting the troops, that we're working to launch. <a href=""http://www.bluetowerstudio.com"">Blue Tower</a> will be offering their services to record deploying members and / or their children reading books. So a soldier that is preparing to deploy can record a book for their child(ren). Or vice versa, the kids can record stories for their deploying parent to take with on a CD. Having deployed myself, I know there are just sometimes when all you want / need is to hear your loved one's voice. And now, as a mommy and a veteran.... ...this project has so much meaning and will be wonderful to work on! Actually, the inspiration kind of came from Kyle's mom. She recorded a CD for Blake, so that he can recognize her voice - since we live so far away. She read a couple books (straight through and then with ad libbing) and recorded herself singing a couple lullabyes. Anyways, this project is still very much so in its infancy. It doesn't even have a name yet."

What is an audio scrapbook?

Do you love to listen to the stories your grandparents tell you about what it was like when they were growing up? Have you ever asked them about their younger years? Would you like to have those stories recorded? Would you like to tell your story so that your kids can listen to them? Kyle can bring his remote recording system to you and your loved ones to record those cherished stories for a couple hours. They can then be edited into a one-hour CD, with background music of your choice. Kyle did one of these a couple years ago, interviewing his grandparents about Christmas traditions. He gave a copy to all his relatives as a Christmas gift. It turned out awesome!"

"event","I'm working on cards tonight for another co-worker's baby shower. She is naming her baby boy Jesse James....... Nursery theme is Superman (and other random superheros that have collected over her pregnancy). However, it's hard to find Superman papercraft stuff that I like. I did a Superman page for my godson, Tony's birthday one year and ended up drawing a web all over the page and matting the pictures with blue & red.

So instead of doing Superman cards - as I had originally planned - I picked out a super light blue for the card part. I plan to put a white square (decorated trim?) with pastel blue baby feet stamps. Around the top I plan to wrap around & tie a ribbon that's attached through the back of the card. I think this design will be easily done in pink as well.

I'm also making these for my baby shower thank you cards, with the only difference being that I plan to find little ""thank you"" charms to attach on the ribbon. Michelle's cards will be left blank, with an offer to stamp whatever she wants on the inside.

Promise to scan the Desert Dinosaurs and Jesse Baby Feet this weekend! We can finally get into the second bedroom and to the desk. The crib and changing table are put together (and ""dressed""). This weekend I plan to bring my crafting supplies down to the studio and get a work space set up there! That way I can have crafting time when Kyle is recording. Our little Nubins will pretty much grow up in the studio, with Mommy crafting and Daddy making record albums. :D

Back to not working....coloring in the little hearts of the ""handmade with love!"" stamp on the back of cards - at my desk."

Pink & Blue Baby Feet Thank You
When Kyle & I found out we were expecting an addition to our household, some of our family and friends sent cards and gift of congratulations. Everyone's generosity and good wishes was much appreciated (and a wonderful surprise). I made these as thank you notes with pink & blue baby feet, since we didn't know what we were having yet.

Pink & Green Baby Feet Thank You
A variation of the Baby Feet Thank You was requested with pink and green for a customer who wanted shower thank yous.

Blue Teddy Bear Gingham
Everyone's having baby boys lately!

We are currently in the process of putting our apartment back together after all of the floors were replaced. Once I can get to the scanner there will be more designs scanned. ....and once I can get to my crafts, there will be new designs on the way. It's my plan to at least have my shower thank yous designed and made by the end of next weekend."

"event","A few girly / multi-use designs. I was asked to come up with some girl designs and at the same time my mom wanted some everyday cards.

The green didn't scan quite right on this one....it's supposed to be more of a soft, sage green. The daisies are actually appliques (sp?).

This pastel yellow is adorned with a pearlescent lime green. At the flower ends there is glitter and rhinestones in the middle of the scrolls.

This design was inspired by an Easter card we got from Kyle's cousin's wife, Alicia. (Got that relation? Would that be a cousin in-law, in-law?) The middle butterfly pops out a little further than the other two. All the butterflies are adorned with glitter and a few glittery stickers. I've also done some of these in purple & yellow!

With this one I was wanting to do something a little bit different and the 4th of July was coming up. I wanted to do something with the music staff I had bought in honor of Kyle.

*LOL* Here's an interesting tidbit: It's storming outside (windy, lighting, thunder, sprinks, overcast even) and the ice cream truck is making its way around the neighborhood. I can hear it's little joyful song outside."

"event","I'm finally getting around to creating a blog for my card designs. I was going to wait and just create a website, but figure I already love to use LJ..... So instead of saturating my personal LJ (<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://astridlynn.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://astridlynn.livejournal.com/""><b>astridlynn</b></a></div>) with these, I may as well create a blog for my cards (and eventually scrapbook pages). <br /><br />I sell most of these cards for $1 per card (with the exception of some cards using extra special stickers &amp; embellishments). All cards also come with matching envelopes. Occassionally I will post sets on ebay, so watch for discounted sets there too. The insides on most of my cards are left blank, or can be customized for whatever you want. (For example, I printed up insides for the shower invites I recently made.)<br /><br />The newest design I have scanned is <strong>Emily Frogs</strong>. A co-worker of mine just had a little baby girl, Emily Olivia. I made these as a gift for her baby shower, since she decorated the nursery with frogs. She decided to use them as baby announcements. <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.weblogimages.com/v.p?uid=astridlynn&amp;pid=564478&amp;sid=eTU06cotV8"" /><br /><br />Most recently, I've made shower invitations for my Colorado baby shower....to include cloth cartoon dinosaurs. (Will upload this weekend. My next project is to make new thank you cards for the shower Mom R &amp; Nicki hosted for me in Minnesota."

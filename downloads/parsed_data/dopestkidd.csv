"event","I know its been awhileIsince I've wrote in this thing but nothing has really changed since I wrote in this in Aug. An hour after christmas I decide once agian to make a tiny situation worse. Lately there has been this girl who is always calling Patrick and she used to like him and everything. Admitt it, if this situation happened to you, you would get pretty worried also. And the fact that she used to like him, kissed him on the cheek and tried to hook up with your friends bf in the past...doesn't make it any better. I always crack little jokes saying ""oh hows your gf"" and stuff. Why do I do that? Because I don't want to make it obvious that its fucking bugging the hell out of me! So instead I make a joke about it. But he makes jokes about my past calling me a slut and how I used to talk to other guys BEFORE we were even together which doesn't make sense because it has nothing to do with our relationship now. And he knows I can't take a joke because in the end whos always hurt and crying? ME. Maybe I'm just overrecating but shit you would do the same! Like if I was talking to a guy on the phone thats my friend everyday....I know he would be tripping even though he said he wouldn't. But if he won't let me go to the mall or movies by myself or with a friend or go to any parties without him....I know for a fact that talking on a phone with a guy will be as big of a deal like he makes with all the other situtaitons. 

Like I said in the previous blog....maybe I deserve better or the other way around. HE DESERVES BETTER. If I can't make him happy..then whats the whole point of being with me? Even though he says he loves me...I think he's falling out of love more then falling in love with me. It hurts...it really does. Just writing this makes me cry. Idk what to do anymore. I guess from now on I won't bring up that certain girl or any of the other shit. And maybe I should just keep my feelings instead of telling him how I feel all the time. Just cry myself to sleep like I do everynight...and he doesn't know about it...Gosh how I love him so much..."

"event","Maann last night was kinea wack. Around eight Sharece called me up and told me to head down to Chris'. Took a quick shower and walked right into Chris' house..HA. Come to find out it was a mini get together/party. Greg, Sharece, Clayton, Lil Jon, Casey, Tamara, Eddy, Carla, & Rachel was there. Chris' was already gettin' tipsy yet he drank some more. I took away his cup and drank some of it 'cuz he already was fucked up. I should've just tooken the whole thing. Lil Jon and Greg was tryin' to give me a lap dance but I pushed them off me. Hahah I love thoes guys. Can't believe they seniors already...dammnn..After awhile me Eddy and Tamra went walking toward the front gate to pick up some pple. Half way there there car passed by and told us to go back. fuckin' walked there for no damn reason. Went back to the house and Casey and Rachel hadda leave. Said bye and found out all them lil girls were there. There was about 6-8 of them. I only knew Asha n she was the only one who said hi. Then Monique introduce herself. Every1 else was minding there own business. Found out Chris' was fuckin' on the floor upstairs. He got fuckked up. Poor thing and at his own house. Started to get bored so me and Tamra headed home. Was on the phone with Noli for a lil bit and called Patrick. He was mad or ""dissapointed""  in me cuz I went there without tellin' him. I love the boy and all but babe needs to stop trippin' and have some trust in me.

"event","Argh I can't believe his movin'. This fuckin' sucks. The only guy who has treated me right and loved me for who I was is leavin' me. When I heard my heart just SANK. Didn't wanna show any emotion though 'cuz I know if I did I was gonna break down in tears. When he leaves we're gonna be on a so called ""break"". Whatever that is. I'm just scared that his gonna fall for someone else which he probably is. Melanie told me sometimes i gottah let things go. But I don't know if I ever can.."

Cleaned the whole morning and my mom dropped me and Katrina off at the mall. Went shopping. Tried making her spend all her money...Muahahaha. Anywho went back to my place and got my stuff so I could ""stay at her house."" Called Patrick and we cheeelllled in the lobby & he opened my present that I gave him. Gerald dropped me off at Pat's house and then me and Pat ate at Chans. Was pretty good maan...but I didn't eat a lot cuz'...idk. Didn't wanna get anymore fater then I'm already am. Rented some movies but only watched one cuz' his ass fell asleep. Its ok though. Couldn't sleep that night. Too much tosing and turning. Took a shower and babe cooked me breakfast. Looked good until he spilled coke all over the freakin' eggs. What a dork man...LoL. But his my dork and i lava lava love him! Ha. Well didn't do nothing else today. Quite xanga....or at least I'm tryin' too. Just gonna write in this thing for awhile I guess..."

Today's the day for the Butterball Gang to hang out. Heck yes. I swear, I look forward to Thursday every week. None of us know what we're going to do. Whatever it is I'm sure it'll be fun.

We're going out to Dora's to swim again today. Hopefully it doesn't rain. It looks kind of iffy. It's our last day to go out there before the leave for Brazil. :[ Jamie's coming with us too.

Erica's getting her braces off today. I'm waiting for her to get home.

Peace out.

Last night I went out to Max & Erma's with my rents, Patty, & Jess. Jess ended up spending the night. After dinner we went with Patty to Walmart. Fun stuff. I found this purse I want to make, but I need a sewing machine. That's something I do not have.

Today wasn't all that <I>fun</I>. Jess & I went with my mum to pick Erica up out in Milford. Long car ride. On the way home we stopped at McNish to get uniforms. How exciting, 15 days until we're back in.

Peace out.

Rye didn't get to actually spend the night last night. The whole time she was here we just bummed around, & then I noticed how warm she was. So she took her temperature & she was running a fever. Needless to say, she went home early.

I'm hanging out with <S>Shelley</S> McShelster today. <B>(HOPEFULLY)</B> I won't be sure until my mum gets home. If we get to hang out today we're going to return bottles & cans & then go spend the bit of money that she gets for 'em. Fun, eh? I bet you're jealous.

Peace."

Rye's spending the night tonight. I was going to go with her for applications, but my mum said no. So she's coming over after around 4. It should be fun.

Call me lame, but I'm seriously about to go On The Line for someone. I had a dream last night about this kid Jon who I knew freshmen year. It made me want to find him & start talking to him. I want to know what's going on in his life, & I want to build some type of a relationship with him. I'm going to talk to Mr. Chris about it today if he's on-line.

Peace out."

Today was a good day. It was so easy to get to Heidi's house. Good for someone who sucks at directions. The movie was good. We saw <I>Must Love Dogs</I>. We were the youngest people in the place. Everyone  had white hair besides us. After the movie we went back to her house & went for a swim. It was fun. I want to start hanging out with her more often. :]

My mum told me that people were bummed that Erica & I didn't go to Bair Lake. :[ I am too, especially since this was my last year as a camper. Alex told my mum that he'd like for me to be a senior counsilor next summer. That would mean me spending my summer out at Bair Lake. I don't know if they'd actually want me. I may be a christian, but I don't think I'm where I should be to be a counsilor.

Peace out."

"event","So... First big purchase was a washer and dryer for the house. I think it will pay for itself by Christmas. July was crazy busy unpacking moving furniture working fulltime and learning about the life changing event that was scheduled for Nov 1. August was filled with pushing myself to stretch and grow preparing my life for Nov 1. September was nice. I got a feel what it will be like to be a fulltime homemaker in the next 5 years. Things picked up in October between working at the City and the YMCA. I dug in deeper trying to stretch and grow into the best wife and best human I can be. Nov 1 LiFE opened its doors for public sales. We are truly seeing the.benefit of our investment of the past five years. We finally have the vehicle to achieve our hopes and dreams. I was offered a promotion and the city and will work my last shift at the YMCA in December. I started my new job on monday. I'm adjusting to the new plan. One day at a time, I'm learning to juggle everything and still leave room for me. This week, things we're not quite up where I wanted them to be. Next week will be a new week with a bright future. I look forward to the day when I only have my priorities in my calendar and not a job that I go to every day. <p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","Its been over a month since i wrote down my thoughts... this week has been phenomenal and crazy busy... 

Chris's business is gaining momentum these days.&nbsp;I am so proud of him taking all the right steps. I can't wait till we can officially work as a team. :-) We haven't missed a meeting since the Major in June and I know of at least 3 appointments Chris booked in a single week. :-) With this kind of momentum, the world cannot stop us. :-)

Wedding plans are slowly but surely coming together. I hope to have the caterer figured out by&nbsp;Aug 29th. I'm even starting the hunt for a photographer. We are going to sit down with one on the 23rd while we are in town. Hopefully we meet with at least one other. My biggest struggle has been finding quality vendors that can work within our limited budget. Decide that the reception arrangements will all be artificial. Not sure yet about the attendants etc. Chris and I have enough allergy problems without walking into a room full of fragrant flowers. 

We are slowly but surely getting things in order with the church here and in Flint. Things are crazy in that respect. Some-days, I wish we had decided to get married here. Though a wedding in Wisconsin would mean most of my dad's family would miss and most of my friends. 

I&nbsp;never wish that I&nbsp;had not moved here. I&nbsp;love the people I work for. I love the community and am slowly building my own social network out here. It takes time to find like minded people though. Living your life with 5% thinking is very different from how most people in Eau Claire see the world. I&nbsp;have an end in mind. I'll make friends along the way that align with my person visions on life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Other wedding news...

My dress will be here the first week in October. I'll visit the seamstress for the first time then. I need to find my shoes for that appointment though. I&nbsp;really want to have a pair of Mary Janes with a 4 Inch Block Heel. These seem extremely difficult to find unless I&nbsp;spend a small fortune. The shoes I&nbsp;will probably wear on more then one occassion, but I&nbsp;can not see spending more then $50 on shoes.

The girls are getting their dresses order. The first dress was received the end of last month. :-)&nbsp;It fit really well and requires minor adjustments. I am excited to see how the saga turns out for the other girls. I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;picked a really good style for everyone and the color really works with all of their skin tones. From the Freckled Brunette and the Strawberry blonde to the pasty white Brunette who can't catch a tan for the life of her. :-)

Every day I get more and more excited. We have less then 300 days to go. I hope to have this whole thing planned by May 1. I have to get orientation set up for June before I leave for Michigan. 

Gosh.. my brain just oozed... i'll write more on another day...

PEACE&nbsp;OUT... all is FABUULous here..."

Tomorrow, finally push to get my belongings moved and a mad dash to pack up for the trip to Mezomanie. Hello world... i can't wait to see you.

No work on&nbsp;Monday... maybe some moving maybe something else... i guess we'll have to wait and see what the day holds though.

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium;"">So... its wed night... the kitty is sneezing and i finally have AC. Found this cute little sleeping room that will meet all my needs for the next year. :-) It's in my budget and best of all.. it has fabulously high ceilings in most of the room... started ruminating about my life... realized i let the rest of the world drive my life way to often. <br /><br />I have good news though... <br /><br />the wedding is still on. We will be getting married June 4, 2010 at St. Matthew's Catholic Church in Flint Town. There will be a reception to follow... to booze or not to booze is the major question about the reception. <br /><br />Shortly after, we will be returning to Eau Claire and having a Shindig here to celebrate all the fun of being married. I am so excited i feel like I might explode.<br /><br />I&nbsp;have found my dress.. and it is just absolutely fabulous. It's not available on the main david's bridal page through. :-(&nbsp;I have pictures though. :-)&nbsp;I&nbsp;can share it with people via snail mail. ;-) <br /><br />The attendants have been chosen... now to decide on flower girls and ring bearers.. and may some kids to carry my train... ah... we'll see. :-)<br /><br />Chris and I have been building the habit of exercise. We both want better health and the ability to get around and enjoy life more easily. :-)&nbsp;I sprung for a YMCA&nbsp;membership for him. :-)&nbsp;Gotta love working for a YMCA&nbsp;casually.&nbsp; The family / couple membership prices are phenomenal if one person works for the YMCA.<br /><br />Summer in Eau Claire is crazy busy... we put 450 kids through our swim lesson program Jun 14-24. I have another 450 kids enrolled this session. Its going to be a crazy buy year for all of us.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am enjoying it though. I love being able to work where I do and do what i love. I&nbsp;touch someone's life every day and in a fairly immediate way. :-)<br /><br />Saturday night we get to go camping. :-)&nbsp;It's Rythm and Booms in Madison and we'll stay with Larry and Debby for the night. :-)&nbsp;Pitching a tent in the back yard hanging out around a bonfire sounds really enjoyable right now. We'll hope the weather is pleasant. Not sure I want to boil when I&nbsp;go to bed and wake up frozen. Gotta love camping in northern wisconsin.<br /><br />A valley fair trip is in our future too.... compliments of work... :-)&nbsp;The fates are shining upon me this year. I am so excited.<br /><br />We'll off to bed.... MIssing All of You... <br /><br />Michigan Peeps.... i hope to be home late August / early September.<br /></span>"

"event","<p><br />So... life in wisconsin.. is an interesting world... i'm moving yet again.. hopefully this one will be a little longer lived then the current place. We have a dog now.. its my roomates dog... but she's a household concern. She's this adorable rat sized chiaua (sp?) She's afraid of my cat and growls at Smoke when she gets to close. Someday, she'll have to figure out how to handle being around a cat. The new house already has a dog and a cat. :-) <br /><br />Work is plugging along. I am still trying to figure out how I am going to supplement my income. I&nbsp;started at the YMCA&nbsp;in Chippewa falls in September. I&nbsp;love teach and it's a lot of fun. Just a bit less money then i'm used to making for the work.&nbsp;Sounds like Stu found an asst manager for hobbs. That's really cool. Doesn't sound like they'll use me at all. I'll need to talk to chad about the Rinks more this week.<br /><br />Life with chris is phenomenal. We have our moments like any couple does as they learn how to be independant yet interdependent. :-) We had a really nice trip to Milwaukee for the fall leadership convention. I&nbsp;hope to have a day in the next year to wander that city and explore all the fun buildings. There are so many building from a time when the outside of a building was designed with an artistic flair. I'll just have to bring a camera and have a lot of fun with it.</p><p>Faith has been an interesting topic in my life. This year though, I am finding myself returning to my catholic roots. Somewhere in side me, my faith has been restored. I find myself at peace when I'm at church or reading through scriptures. It's beyond excititng to have joy and happiness in my heart by simply knowing that my god loves me and is watching over me. Next year, I&nbsp;intend to participate in the RCIA&nbsp;classes. I decided to wait for a variety of reasons. Chris has begun the process of learning about Catholicsim and plans to fully join the faith.&nbsp;He's been attending masses with me and is taking the class at that parish. I&nbsp;decided that for him I&nbsp;would wait. I want him to have a place where he can go and explore and be free to speak his mind. I want this year and the entire process to be about him. :-)<br /><br />Frequently, we have talked about when we have kids or &quot;Our Wedding&quot;. We are still building the dream though. As soon as the dreams begin to become reality, I will share this news.&nbsp;I wait with baited breath just as you all do. The power to change the situation is somewhat in my hands. I will continue to do what I can to keep the dream alive. When the lord deems it time, I will be prepared and I will be ready.<br /><br />I&nbsp;miss many things about life in Michigan. In many ways, I feel like a part of me is missing. I&nbsp;enjoyed so many special friendships and now. I&nbsp;barely get to see anyone. As time goes by, I hope to take several extended trips home. I just need the finances and the time away from work . If I have not contacted you over the past few months, please know it's not due to lack of interest in you and your life. Please know that I am struggling to find time by myself to read a book, to explore who I am in this new community, and simply put my thoughts in to words. <br /><br />I miss everyone of you and wish all of you the best everyday. <br /><br />I hope to heep you informed over the next several months as I begin to plan for the coming year.</p>"

"event","seems like yesterday i walked out of the seminar in wasau... and it's almost been a week... i've been better about keeping the good cd's rolling in the car and reading material recommended by the team. I think that's a good start for 7 days. Plan on ordering some product in the next week here. That will make rotating the pattern a lot easier...

work has been filled with way too many hours in front of my computer. me and my spreadsheets. Final reports for 08-09 are due a week from monday. I'm plugging away. we'll get the data developed so we can write the final report. Yippie! Skippie!

Now fall... what to do for extra income... thinking about applying for the hobbs assistant manager position. something new to add to my resume and help me build to bigger and better things. Hopefully they would be willing to split it into two 20 hour positions. Aquatics has 20 hours of my time. We'll see how it all works out in the end. Step one... would be to apply.

This weekend we are driving home. Going to go thte slow way through the UP with the empty trailer and enjoy the drive. Coming home we'll probably be on the road at night. That means we most probably will take the free way.... not much planned other then getting home... we can figure out the rest when we get there.

we'll lets see if we can get back into the habit of daily reflection. One good thing about seamagic... i can post when i get back online... even if i'm off line for several days."

"event","So... it's been so sudden I'm not sure who knows everything and who does not.

1) I am moving to Eau Claire, Wisconsin and I will be leaving on April 1st. I am planning to arrive in Chicago around 1am Chicago time to reach Eau Claire around 6am.

2) I applied for, interviewed for, and accepted a job working for Parks and Rec in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. I will be the Aquatic Director for their program supervising all of their Aquatic programming. :-) I was supposed to start April 9. I found out on Tuesday March 24th, it would be best I start on April 3rd.

3) I am currently seeking a place of my own in the Eau Claire area. Most likely it will be sharing a place with roommates I do not know. This has proved to be both good and bad in past situations. I'm looking want the best so I am expecting it to be awesome. In the mean time, I am going to be staying with Chris as a guest. We both feel it very important that a couple does not ""live"" together until they are truly married. Sharing finances its jut one stress that we don't think our relationship should have to deal with until we are truly ready.

4) Smoke is traveling with me. We are doing everything we can to make the car ride less stressful for her. Until I find a place for me that takes cats, Chris's best friend will be boarding her for me. I am going to visit daily and take care of her basic needs. This way though, she will not be separated from me for as long as she has been in the past. I'll be spending most of the day Thursday with her helping her adjust to her new surroundings. Things have been stressful enough so far. I don't want to make things anymore traumatic by just dropping her on Jerome's doorstep and leaving to settle in at Chris' apartment.

5) I am spending Monday in Flint. I'll finding everything in will need with me in Eau Claire until i have my own place is at mom's. There are also a couple of farewell events planned.

6) Today is Sunday. I need to be through my to-do list for packing in Detroit by Tuesday night. I want to spend Wednesday resting. :-) If anyone wants to help me pack you are welcome to stop by after 7pm tonight. I'll be here. I just need to pick up more boxes on my way home from my swim lessons. I like the office storage boxes best. They are small enough that its hard to make them too heavy.  They also stack well. I'm aiming to have the sorting done before I crawl into bed tonight."

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium"">Jan.... i worked and worked and worked till my head was swimming. I&nbsp;also prepared for my trip to Eau Claire. Hard to believe for me but I was planning for a&nbsp;week off from both jobs, unpaid. I was almost caught up on all my bills when I&nbsp;left town. Spent a lot of time with Courtney in Flint and invested some of my time into volunteering for Red Cross. I started to get back in the habit of&nbsp;CDs and books for TEAM. Spent some good times with Courntey in Flint investing time in a friendship that I won't be able to in the near future.<br /><br />Feb... that's this month. Started the month behind on one bill. Still trying to catch up. The first check of the month was the short check from my vacation. That's okay though we will be putting in the insane hours again most of the month. <br /><br />I&nbsp;have a day blocked out for Red Cross. A day blocked out for TEAM. A day blocked out for a friend I have not seen since before I walked out of the doors at LTF for the last time. <br /><br />Things at the YMCA&nbsp;are moving along. I'm getting settled in and adjusting to my new schedule. Still trying to get the paperwork completed for a raise, I am now not just a Lifeguard. I am certified as a YMCA swim lesson instructor. <br /><br />The trip to Eau Claire Jan 30 thru Feb 8 was amazing. Though, I did get horribly ill with allergies and had to scrub my job search. Found some prospective landlords to look further into.&nbsp;I am leaning heavily towards moving in with some college students. The rent and bills will be cheaper and i'll probably be making 7.25/hour&nbsp; when i move there. Federal Minimum wage goes up this summer. Thank GOD!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Met Chris's best friend / brother from another mother. Jerome is a hoot!!&nbsp;I had a lot fun when we hung out with him and his family. Chris's parents are really cool and I have no problems with them. They drove me around while I was looking at properties and took me to the museum in town. That was really neat. I could definitely go back and spend a whole day there just absorbing all the information. They have an old school soda fountain, which is really neat.<br /><br />The bus system was my primary means of transportation while chris was at work. They are almost like a taxi service. Stand at a corner that a bus passes and they will pick you up. They have very few official stops but will pick you up if they are going past. For the most part you can get across town in an hour as long as you time your departures right. Stay an extra few and you could wind up get where you are going an hour later then planned. All in all I could definitely survive not driving a car anywhere I wanted to go. They even have a bike rack on the front of every bus. If the bus can't get me where i want to go I could ride the rest of the way. I could even live a little farther from the bus line and use the bike to get me to the bus. :-) I found the YMCA and looked at the college. Masters program in fitness management may be something for me eventually. Chris's parents place is even accessible by the bus out here in Altoona aka cinder city.&nbsp; I can really see myself moving there. I didn't want to come home. It's the kind of place&nbsp;I want to be. Just the right size of town for me. :-)</span><br />"

"event","First things first... i know I've missed way too many birthdays and I am such a schmuck for doing so. I have been a little self absorbed of late. I have been struggling to make ends meet financially. I'm trying to work two jobs to make some extra money. 40 hours at minimum wage just doesn't cut it. Between both jobs though I'm lucky to break that 40 hour number. :-( Trying to get the schedule just right is tres complique. Okay so my french is rusty. I <SPAN _fcktemp=""1""></SPAN>leave home at dawn and return after dark every night. :-( I am so sick of this schedule. <SPAN _fcktemp=""1""></SPAN>I just want to be done with it. have a few irons in the fire to resolve this dilemma. Wish me luck.

Many of you have been in suspense. <SPAN _fcktemp=""1""></SPAN>I hear i was blogging incessantly about <lj user=""alythqueluah"">, aka Chris. The trip to the U.P. was one of the most amazing weekends of my life. The drive was long but well worth it. Fri, once i got north of west branch, i drove in and out of snow. The bridge was clear and easy go. North of Trout Lake the roads started to get treacherous. Thank god for driving my car instead of a rental. Thankfully 28 is mostly a straight shot and they have the rebar to mark the edge of the road. I arrived safely about 30 ahead of schedule. I didn't even rush. I had the cruise at 65 in the LP and when conditions allowed drove 55 - 65 in the UP. Many thanks to bill and his shortcut through trout lake. The scenery is beautiful on a sunny day all covered in snow. Just like it better when it is already on the ground and not falling as I drive. Munising got a fresh 4 to 6  as we were driving in. Tried several times to pull into the driveway at the hotel and failed. Chris was in a snow bank and needed a lot of TLC to get his car up the hill and into the lot. Thankfully the hotel owner is the city plow guy. He came sanded and plowed. With a little pushing, we got chris's car around the block and set up for a running start. We decided, once he was in the lot, to leave his car parked for the weekend. Rear wheel drive and lots of snow are a bad combination. We stayed at the Terrace Motel. A quaint little place with no rules and an encouragement to turn off your cell phone and enjoy your vacation. The family that operates the place is so sweet. We stayed in room 3 and it will probably become a tradition. We both loved the community and there is so much to do year round. One trip is not going to be enough. :-) In the past, i blogged about the community center i intend to open and operate. I think a small community in the UP is where the dream will become a reality. Fri night we spent just cuddling and talking. We never made it out for dinner though the snack of cheese popcorn was more then dinner enough for both of us. I have never been so happy to just sit and talk with the man i love for hours. 

With the influx of snow, we put the hike on hold. Sleeping in till 10 was amazing. Breakfast at Syndney's is to die for. We walked the town after breakfast. We stopped at two drug stores, the visitor's center, and a dollar store. I'd brought a DVD player but the T.V. didn't like the DVD player. Also the DVD player didn't like the RF adapter which we eventually found in town. After much craziness and purchasing a new DVD player, we spent Saturday afternoon watching Kung Fu Panda and lounging around. I have never been so content doing nothing. I'm usually the we have to get up and go do something type. When I'm with chris, I'm content to just be. We did make it out to dinner. I wore a black dress i'd never worn in public before. I knew it was low cut. Just not that low cut. Wow! We went to dinner at the navigator a quaint little diner on 28 and then stopped in a pub for a drink. The pool table was taken so we decided to just head back to the hotel for another quiet night in. :-)
<P></P>Sunday we packed up after much procrastination. Breakfast was had at Sydney's again. After stopping by the gas station and the drug store for supplies. We took some time to get Chris's car back on the road again. We needed a couple bags of rock salt, break fluid, and a tube of sand. With much TLC, we got his car on the road and parked at the visitor center. This was our day to sight see. We drove over to Munising falls and hiked the sort path to the falls. Even in their frozen state they were very majestic.  We tried to get to miner's castle and picture rocks. Unfortunately, they don't plow that far. After the falls, we stopped at sand point. We both are in love with lake superior so it was a must do on both of our list to stop and just listen to the lake for a little while. Around 2, we bid adieu and headed to our respective homes. The drive home was easier yet more exhausting. I have never had to fight the urge to turn around so hard. It felt like i was going the wrong direction as I traveled home. A 8 hour drive took me 12. I did stop several times but i was just not motivated to get home. The only solace was knowing he's coming here to visit Dec 27th. :-)

I hope that everyone here likes him as much as I do. :-)"

"event","<FONT size=4>So... November 21 i leave for the UP and on the 23 I'll return. <lj user=""alythqueluah""> and I will be hiking Bruno's run together on the 22. :-) The rest of the weekend is yet unplanned. :-) This will be our first trip together as an official couple. That word is still so odd to me. 

Oh yeah... most of y'all have no background on <lj user=""alythqueluah"">. His name is Chris. We met up at Northland in 1997 and were dating by February 1998, if not sooner. We had a psychology class and were theater geeks together. Somewhere along the way I told him that dating wasn't working out. Truth be told I was head over heals for him and didn't know how to handle it. I broke up with him because I just wasn't ready for all that Chris was. 

He dropped off a box of chocolates and a valentine's day card at my dorm room on a night when I wasn't taking visitors. It was the sweetest thing to wake up to the next morning. He doted on me and found away to be near me every day. (Sometimes this was a bit much back then).

I never forgot that feeling I had with him. Honestly, i think I always compared people to him unconsciously. 

The people i have been with since have always fallen short. I was afraid they might be too clingy or not around enough. I looked for validation in ways that they just didn't know how to give it. I sabotaged anything that came close yet fell short. No one could give me what i needed. I wasn't sure what i was looking for or what i really wanted. 

I started wanting to be back in Wisconsin a few years ago. Something told me i need to go back and reclaim a part of me. I have never made it back to Wisconsin like I want to. Life seems to constantly get in the way. Recently, I received a friend request from Chris on facebook. We facebook chatted one night for hours. It seemed like we had never lost contact. :-) The friendship was alive and well. 

We are both walking similar paths in our lives right now. We are both actively involved in and using the TEAM training system. We both share so many interests that it's obvious why we were together in the past. Now.. we are different people yet still great together and its amazing. We started texting back and forth all the way up until the major in Louisville.  I walked out of the tool room with butterflies in my stomach. One look from him and i was under a spell. Three hours drifted by without much notice. We buzzed through ten years of life story in no time. We parted ways and I spent the entire address following wondering where he was. I got a hug from him that night as we left the building and plans were being formulated for the next day. 

He sat with me and my TEAMmates all through Saturday. We found time to slip away and talk on the concourse or go shopping in the tool room together. Sunday was spent with him and his TEAMmates. :-) I am having a hard time describing how I felt. We text messaged all the way home. :-) 

We text way too much every day. I'm just beaming with joy most of the time. I can't even believe this is all happening to me.  Somewhere along the way we made it official. :-) In my heart, i was exclusive long before that. I feel like a teenager with her first boyfriend. According to one of my TEAMmates, I appear to be one as well. 

This trip is the first of many for us. We have to work hard to be able to take time to enjoy each others company, in person. Eventually, we will be geographically closer to one another. Right now, we just have to make do with the moments we can get. 

I can't even fall asleep tonight with so many thoughts swirling around inside my head. Hopefully, this entry has helped to fill y'all in and to give some background to the future stories. :-)</FONT>"

"event","<FONT color=#975e9d size=4>Sunday- Missed a friends bonfire but attended a rally / press conference for the Nader / Gonzalez campaign. I feel even more convicted about the choices I am making in my personal political convictions. I have long seen the government in need of change. I know that many people out there believe the same way, but are weighing out the pros and cons to determine the lesser of two evils. If both are evil, why not stand by one's convictions and vote for someone you personally can stand behind, without turning on them 3 years into their term of office. If enough of us stand up and encourage others to do the same, the herd will change direction and vote for the candidate they personally believe will best service our nation. This is going to be the only way for true political change to occur in our nation. I encourage every one of you to seek out a broader understanding of the presidential candidates this year and truly find one you can entrust your vote to. Think outside the box, seek to know and understand their platforms. Only an educated individual can truly determine the best candidate; who will serve the interest of a majority of U.S. Citizens, at home and abroad. Speak your mind with your ballot and open your heart to the freedom of taking a stand for a candidate you truly believe in. Thanks for dinner Rob and for sharing some of your Birthday weekend with me. :-)

Monday- A brand new episode of Gossip Girl was the highlight of my evening. :-) I'm silly i know. Something out the Jenny and her brother hits really close to home. I look forward to seeing how the situations unfold this year. Some of the plots were so outrageous that I don't know how they will ever top those story lines. yes it was mindless t.v. but well worth the hour of my time. Oh.. and chocolate temptations were given into. I can't seem to shake the horrible craving for chocolate I have had lately. Time to look deeper for the source of my emotional discomfort.

Tuesday- Secret Life of an American Teenager ... is and addicting show that deals with real teen issues. I'm not sure how it all worked into family friendly programming. It definitely did put some issues out on the for front for families to talk about and showed the consequences of many behaviors teens are displaying today. Hopefully it touched someone's life and helped them to make the right choices. I got my first check at the Hardware and my last check at the old job. Happy the checking account is back in the black. Figuring out how to live off what I really have to spend sucks. I was so far in the Red its like i got paid 2 dollars an hour for my last week at the old job.

Wednesday- A trying day at work of being torn between too many things to do. Got home to find we have a new I.S.P. A 6MB band width is amazing. I'm so excited. I can surf and explore in real time again. HOORAY!! Still trying to figure out why i need a chocolate injection intravenously. :-(

Job search- I am still actively seeking work. I'm having difficulty with applying to one job everyday. I just want to grow roots and become a vegetable when I get home from the hardware store. 

Mona Vie- I have every reason to throw myself into over drive yet feel like I don't know why. I must not have the right reason for doing this yet. 

Home- Life at the Carpet Ship is peaceful. Smoke is at a healthy weight finally. She seems content to be an indoor cat again. Sometimes she is the most stand offish woman in the world. Though at the most inconvenient time she'll come begging for all of my attention. She even greets me at the door when I get home. You'd think she was a dog. Wait... hold up... she must have picked up some quirks from being around a dog instead of other cats when she was a youngster.</FONT>"

"event","So... called the Hardware Store my first full day ""unemployed"". Lori had me stop by and fill out an application on Wednesday. Thursday she called and asked when i could start. Friday i was back behind the cash register and getting my feet wet in housewares. It's kind of bittersweet but nice to know that they were that willing to have me come back. I have worked a three day stretch this week. Next week i think it will be four. Its a floating schedule though who knows where I will actually land.

Today I finished getting everything together for my Unemployment Claim. Mailed in my fact finding form and registered for work. Monday I make my first call. We shall where that all lands. I'm hoping they side in my favor. This is my life though. Got a lead on a job from the Michigan Works! office and I am looking into No Worker Left behind. I figure I have been required to pay all these taxes over the years. I should probably make use of all these programs I have been funding. 

I am trying to keep up on housework but in my mental state its hard to get up and do it. I know it will help me feel better. Just getting past the inertia of doing nothing is difficult. I replay the situations of my last days at the old job and seek where I went wrong. I know that you reap what you sow. I just don't know how i sowed the seeds I did. I think figuring that out is mainly what keeps me awake at night.

Still trying to figure out how to financially pull myself together. Its kind of hard to do much until I know the final decision on my unemployment. Wait and see... wait and see... that's all I can do there. I have some plans I'd like to put in motion but they require me not having to work all the time and actually having sometime to focus on them. Maybe I chose the wrong job when I made my choice last spring. Wait.. maybe I wasn't supposed to choose either job and completely relocate. Not worth my energy to what if this to death though.

Kinda miss the release of dancing the night away. Miss having happy dancing muscles... lately they've been mighty cranky. :-( Getting settled in at the house to some extent. Its hard to develop routine when I feel my life is in a constant state of flux. Fall is coming maybe relief is insight.

I have no choice in the matter though. It is a mess I made and&nbsp; I must now clean up . :-( Working hard on trying to stick to a budget and track my spending. Haven't been as good about writing things down this week. :-( I am going to have to invest sometime in trying to go backwards and make sure I have a good picture for my mentoring session on Monday. So much running randomly through my head .. i'm not sure i can capture it all here. Overall life is on the UP and UP. I like that. Little things are happening that are tieing things together for me.

"event","Just finished Anatamoy of Peace today. I am so blown away I don't know what to think. It is a well written story that sucks you in and won't let you out. It's probably on of the best books I have read on System yet.&nbsp; For those that need explanation:System is a monthly subscription through TEAM. Its a book, some CD's, and a Seminar Ticket. These materials are designed to help in my growth as a leader and business owner. I never thought a Leadership Book could be such a good read. It taught me so much but in such a gentle way. For a change, I don't feel like someone smacked me upside my head and left me laying out cold on the floor of some dark basement. I am so passionate about what I feel I am really having a hard time putting this into words. All I have to say is way to go Executive Policy Council. I would never have found a book so good shopping for myself. This book hit so close to home. I may have to keep it in my rotation for regular revisiting just to ensure that I am on my way to applying the concepts it contained. :-)"

"event","Had a dream today about a woman I have dreamed about possibly met once before who has a British accent. In my dream she worked for Lifetime and was looking for this guy I know as Rocky. Rocky is this awesome aquatic expert in my dreams. I may have met him once at a lifeguarding role out years ago but I am not sure. In my dream there seemed to be a Red Cross reorganization at work I finished my lesson in the water and we were all attending a presentation on deck about the amazing quality and tradition of what is the Red Cross. The chick with the British accent asked where our Swim equipment was and I was like ""Holly has us storing it in that room over there"". My pool deck in my dream was very different from the one I work at in real life. We had a instructional pool and the leisure pool and a lap pool. Plenty of room for swim team, aerobics, and swim lessons to all occur at once. :-) In response she said, ""Cool Rocky and were going to talk about the equipment and how its not being taken cared of properly."" Hearing this I went on the defensive and was more concerned about making a good impression and chasing kids out of the pool that weren't supposed to be there, then the presentation itself. Rocky knew me through my Red Cross involvement but I wanted him to know that my job was not as bad as they were assuming. I then went and worked with a messed up basketball class in the gym it was totally weird.&nbsp; Someday I'll figure out this out but for now I'm a complete blank.

Otherwise, Life is becoming normalized. I think I actually am beginning to like myself for the first time in forever. I am actually proud of myself and many of the things I am doing right now. :-) I am living somewhere that gives me a big happy. I have moved in and out of the Carpetship over the past few years. This time its fairly permanent. I have my own room and I'll have a utility in my name.&nbsp; ZOMG... its becoming a true reality. I'm not yet sure what to do with myself. I do know it will all come together eventually and to be patient. Some things in life are for sitting down and figuring. Other things in life are like domino's, you make one decision and many others are made by making&nbsp; simply that one decision, whether we realize it or not. Its like you made 15 decisions at once. Kinda scary most days. Today I am and will be brave. :-) Well, time to fill the humidifier and get on with the home makeover that's happening over the next 72 hours."

"event","The life i know is constantly changing... interviewing like crazy... decided my preference would be a club here in Michigan. It may mean a lengthy commute for a little while, but a steady income and set schedule would be very much appreciated at this point in my life. I have come to realize that I approach relationships very different from most and should just ask the questions on my mind early on. This time we made it a week and a half...&nbsp; before i had to ask a those burning questions... needless to say shortly after reading my email the he decided he was in over his head. I am not the most patient person when it comes to the unknown and to relationships. I want to know what your goals are and where you intend for things to go. I don't want to hear boys tell me they dream of being married to me and not be ready to go for it. I don't know what it is about my personality that makes them that comfortable with me early on. I don't want to change it. I have just come to except it. I am not looking for someone to simply be a companion for right now. I fall hard when I fall and don't want to put myself through having my world come apart at the seems again. Sometime I will find that boy that sees it like I do. I don't want to enter into a relationship with someone if they do not see us sharing a future. I don't want to be with someone who is not ready to start setting goals and working towards them. Its time to look for and determine my future. Getting caught up in a moment and not moving forward is no longer an option in my life. I had my quarterlife crisis and am now ready to move on from it. If only I had known the importance of goal setting and a future focused perspective five years ago. I would not have seen my life as over when my relationship fell apart. Now I am constantly thinking what is the next step. Right now its moving up to being a Department Head and potentially taking on a bigger staff. A couple years from now, its grand opening a new club. Learning about the process of opening the doors of a brand new building. These goals are important to me because I want to open a community center in a community that has lost the sense of connection to their neighbor because they do not have a place to congregate and commune with each other. It seemed recently that I have found one to many of those boys. :-) 

Recently I had a friend ask me to describe the man I see myself spending the rest of my life with. For posterity sake, I feel the need to log that list here.

My future man is:
Emotionally even keeled, helps balance my emotional swings, and does not provoke them. He is able to freely express verbally and physically what he is feeling and thinking. He is responsive to and receptive of my emotional needs. 
Physically he will have eyes and a smile that tell me a story. I'll feel like i fit in his arms. 
Interests- The arts will be a focus in their life. Occasionally catching a stage performance. Live music will commonly be enjoyed. Self improvement will be something they are always working on. Movies will be a way to spend some quiet time together. He'll love to dance and be a strong lead. I'll be able to explore a side of me that I haven't been able to express. Ballroom, salsa, hip hop, ebm.. they all have their own little format. He will be willing to learn what my love language is and help me find out what his is. Massage will be a shared gift. 
Sexually- He will understand or be willing to learn the art of foreplay. Physical touch is one way in which I understand that I am loved. He will be able to take the lead yet be responsive to what I am expressing and feeling. He'll want to fall asleep curled up together one body one soul. 
Domestically- He'll understand that I have piles yet know that I know what's in them. He'll be willing to let me make him dinner on regular basis and occasionally i will arrive home and be told not to lift a finger. Dinner will be waiting for me and he'll be willing to do everything he can to pamper me. 

This list is in no way all inclusive. Everything on the list is not required for their to be a relationship. Many things can be learned in time. Commitment is a huge part of being in a future focused relationship."

"event","So I find myself on a VNV kick this week. In the mornings, I zone out for a bit with just me my lap top and VNV. I don't know why but its one of the few things that's soothing. It's like a constant reminder of this may suck but it will all be alright. There is a bright side to everything. Yesterday, we held the viewing at the Funeral home and the Ponicha (wake service = like a rosary). It was amazing all who came to wish us well. We filled the funeral home with tears and laughter. It was so nice to talk about the happy times with a smile on our face and laughter in a hearts. Its odd to realized that last tie to the byzantine church will be released forever after every thing today.&nbsp; Its probably for the best, every time hear the cantor's voice I'll probably be reduced to a puddle of tears for the rest of my life. No more opening and closing of the gates. No more bells ringing. No more incense at every mass. Roman catholics of modern day use these only for special religious rites and holiday. Today I'll be a pall bearer as well. Yep thats right. I live up to being the girl child who wanted to play the wanted to play war games in the back yard more then play house. We'll i loved my first kitchen, but still turned out to be more of a Tom boy then a girlie girl. Its all good though cuz I wouldn't be my grandpa's Emmy if I wasn't the way I am. A family member I haven't seen in ten years mentioned yesterday that I have not changed. Most of you know me to be the one to try and find a positive spin on everything. To make the impossible seem possible. They do too and most of them only knew me well until I was 9 or so. After that, our family went in ten million different directions with out a central anchor to bring us all home. Funerals and weddings are all that bring us together now. In time maybe we will all find a way to bring everyone back together. At least from my parent's generation on. My kids need to know the history of my family. How closely we were all connected to the sit down strike. My father would not have been born if the Sit Down Strike did not happen. We'll get it together. I plan to bring it all together some who. Guess that's another thing to add to my dream circle."

driven before. so that was... interesting to say the least. but
never fear, we got it out eventually and now he's on the way to pick up

friday-&nbsp; halloween thing<br>
saturday- dance then study w/ erica (&lt;3)<br>
sunday- church then trick-or-treating<br>
monday- trick-or-treating again<br>
<br>
free candy = love<br>
<br>
should be fun though. sunday im going with Alexis and others.&nbsp;
Monday im going w/ the Combo, emily, and ben. were being the wizard of
oz but i still havent decided which one i will be. and i have no idea
about the other times.<br>
<br>
so it has been confirmed</font><font size=""3""> that i have a minor stress&nbsp;</font> fracture<font size=""3""> in my right

my XC team lost our last meet against billerica, landing us 2nd place in
division two. way better than last year.<br>
<br>
dance is psycho. i look like ive been beaten with a stick.<br>

school is equally as psycho. but never fear concerned parents, no bruises from there.<br>

so last night was my ""Final Assembly"" (AKA eighth grade graduation)
then semi-formal dance afterward. it was awesome. i had so much fun. my
school has finally moved past the idea that a. grinding is the only
form of dance and b. only girls can dance, so basically everyone danced
and they played a lot of old disco and rock songs. hmm... so yeah. it
was amazing. i danced with a ton of guys too ;). heehee.<br>
not too many people cried at the end, which was good because we all
know how uncomfortable i am around crying people. it was kinda sad
though. our school is K-8th so ive been with most of these people for
nine years. plus theres only about 100 or so of us because we're only
1/4th of the eighth graders in Methuen. anywho, its a little more
emotional for us than other schools since we're a little more attached
to each other. i hugged like everyone in the room at least twice. ok...

yesterday was really good. we got to go outside the last period. my friends and i made up a new game involving hitting people with lacrosse balls and sticks. those hurt. i got hit 5 times including the butt and face. i swear i always get hit in the butt and/or face. its doomed to happen so i might as well not avoid it. it was a fun game though. you should try it sometime.

friday was an interesting school day. it began normally. Lessons in the morning (aka free period). my hair was duct-taped, it hurt. then there was the candy sale. now, we all know that i dont consume very much sugar on a regular everyday day. whenever i have even a little bit of sugar, it affects my brian more than the regular sugar-eating bean.  and so, 1.5 airheads and 4 starbursts later, i was bouncing off of walls. the laughing fits lasted for about a half hour but it wore off and left a stomache ache by the next period when i had to take a standardized math test. but it was deathfully easy so im okay. Then loop on friday night with Lily and Alexis. we just hung out.

Saturday kiristiane came over and we saw star wars episode three. it was good. definitely not the best star wars ive seen, but okay. some parts were so cheesy and/or stupid i was kind like ""george lucas what in the world were you thinking"", but they were funny so i didnt mind too much. then we explored the deep dark depths of my fridge. scary.(she slept over)

sunday was church and then school work. i've been doing a TON of extra credit in english because of my grade dropping below an A+. and we just cannot have that.

monday was memorial day. Happy belated Memorial Day! i ran outside in the rain and got insanely soaked. mucho funo.

"event","hmm... soooo the weekend...

friday i went to the mall with Abby and Lily and got an awesome bag. other than that we mostly walked extremely fast-pacedly around the mall saying hello to our various acquaintances. saturday was dance, which ended early, then a dreadful couple of hours watching the baby while my mother shopped. it sounds easy, but its really not, trying to keep the thing under control without having someone call the police for child abuse.  sunday was church then a dance competition. we did a TON better than last time, but mostly because the other schools there didnt amount to too much competition (sorry if i've offended anyone).  we got all golds and tied for fifth with our ""line"" (Le Jazz Hot)and tied for third with our ""class"" (Turbulence) and got into the semi-finals to go to germany again. but last year we got in and didnt go anyways (they went w/ tap instead) so i doubt we're going this year. but enough of my bragging.

school is going good (or ""well"", i guess). report cards are coming out friday and then spring break next week *ca-ching!*.

yesterday was mock trial. i was doing closing statement. i was soooo nervous because i HATE public speaking. but i did okay. i got an 8/10, but my team lost by a couple points anyways. oh well.

so friday was good. we had shortened classes. math i had a wicked easy quiz. then all my other subjects i spent franticly trying to finish my english project.  we had to make this shield thing, kinda family crestish. we had what our name meant (mine is hardworker, black-eyed), flags from our nationalities, symbols for what child were (i am second), and then just pictures and stuff. mine came out pretty good i thought.

in the afternoon we had this ""bowl-a-rama"" thing. it was actually pretty fun. there were 16 teams of 3, but my team lost in the second round because i blanked out and i couldnt remember anything, but my teammates didnt help much with that so yeah. not totally my fault.  

so, call me if you wanna do something this week. i'll be home."

the snow is HUGE. my dog can barely run in it. he keeps getting stuck. its up to his back now. he looks like a fish or alligator or something. i find it amusing.

I watched Supersize Me and Saved! with mi familia last night. both very good movies. go watch them! Supersize Me was very interesting. i never knew that fast food was actually THAT bad for you. especially the chicken nuggets. im never eating those again. i especially liked the part about school lunches. i didnt really think about how unhealthy they really are. Saved! was awesome to. very very funny. ""Get your Christ on!"". it also had this really cool song called ""In The Sun"" by Joseph Arthur. plus the Patrick guy is a babe.

Church was ""canceled"" today or something. but im going over erica g.'s later. there will be potluck and watching of the Patriots make it to the superbowl. mmmm i LOVE potlucks. it should be fun."

today was ""career day"" all i learned is that being a doctor takes a lot of school (which i already knew) and not to get hit with a stun gun. it was interesting, but not too boring, except for the guys from the government. i still have no dea what they do. 

i am seeing In Good Company with emily later. it should be good.

new year's day my dad, two of the brothers, and I set up the trampoline. it was amazing and wicked fun and i could jump really, really high. then we put up the net. i dont like it as much w/ the net as before but i guess i can deal with it. mum says its ""safer"" or whatever. humph. yeah but its still good. i was on for like an hour strait yesterday so now my backishneck kinda hurts. or maybe i just slept on it funnily.

Lately I feel like everyone is taking advantage of me. I can only give so much. When I can't, I am made out to be the horrible person. Maybe I should just care about myself and no one else. But I was told I have a problem being too nice to a lot of people that do not deserve it. I just want everyone to be happy..lol

It seems like febuary is forever away and I can't wait til it is finally here. I'll be done with Massage Therapy and will be able to get a better job. Plus its something I enjoy to do. I have a 4.0 so far and I'm hoping to maintain that to the best of my ability. Of course I'll be goin back to school for Physical Therapy which I can't wait. I'm just having a tough decision to where I want to work with massage. Either at a clinic, but most likely I'll be working on a cruise for a little bit. My friends cousin worked on a cruise for massage and told me that the guy wants me to call him when im done with school. I always wanted to travel and I think it would be a great experience for me and besides its good money. 


why do people do things to either please or make someone else jealous? I mean the past few months I had girls pretend they were gay and pretended they liked me just to get the guy they wanted. Kinda weird but it happens. I would rather be the one that is jealous then bein the one that is used to make someone else jealous. I can relate that last sentence to plenty of things. I just let everyone do what they please and if they are happy, let them be. If they are not happy, then I wish them lots of luck. 

South of Nowhere comes on tomorrow night and I am very excited. I'm soo jealous and I wish I was a character in that show. I would like to experience love once again but with someone that can trust me. But anyways a couple of us girls will be attending our own lil party to watch this amazing show after the volleyball game that I honestly could careless to attend, but as coach I have no choice.haha But I love all the girls despite their highschool drama.

How bout I got accused of being on drugs the other day. I can't help that I lost weight without dieting or exercise. When I was at ESU, I did go to the gym a lot at the beginnin and I ate whenever I was hungry. I'm surprised people even care bout me that much to have a descent amount of time conversation to make sure I'm ok.. I just thought it was quite funny. 

My cousin and my lil sis think I'm nuts but thats ok. I know you both love listenin to me argue on the phone. What can I say, I'm out of control...lol ashley

I'm started to become more proud of myself as time moves on slowly. I started to read and write again, which I needed to do so I can relieve all my stress. My cousin and I have started to attend B&N more often and there is this one book I started to read and its a really good book so I wanna head back up there probably tomorrow night so I can finish it and start a new one. 

Sometimes I wish time would move alil faster so I can be done with school and move on in my life. I just want to get out of this valley for good and move to the state that I always wanted to move to, aka cali. It would be a great experience to be in a completely different area/climate and meet all new ppl. I heard that ppl are a lot nicer in the south than up here. I hope that is true. 

Everyone best be rooting for the STEELERS today....GO STEELERS!!!! they're my second favorite team and I wanna atleast have something to look forward to when superbowl rolls around. I love football =)

"event","Right now I'm over my cousin Ashley's house while she has runnin around to do. This may possibly be my new home soon. Things are just goin very rough around my household. They may believe that I have no emotions or any kind of feelings at all, but thats because I'm strong. I don't need to cry because that gets me nowhere and I'm 18. I quess once I find a job, that will determine where I will be living until I end up in New York. I just need to get my transfer scholarship, so I'm not goin until I get it. 

I don't care what anyone says but I'm really starting to believe I have bad luck. Nothin goes right for me ever, no matter how hard I try. It gets to the point where I want to give up on everything, including my dreams. Of course I still procceed forward probably just to make myself more mad because it doesn't seem to change much. Owell its life and hopefully it works out for myself in the end.

To a certain someone:
Yes, a kiss that is unforgetable and gives you the most amazing feeling inside is someone that you truly care about and have a lot of feelings for. You usually can't get them out of your mind which tends to make you go alil crazy because you just feel like spending almost every day with that person. Sometimes it can be disappointing if they don't feel the same for you or they are just too afraid to follow their heart because they believe they will not be any good for the other person or they are just protecting themselves. Thats why people need to take the chance either way because deep down in their heart they will have that ""what if"" feeling and sometimes it turns to be the most amazing thing in the world. Sometimes when you find out the truth, you just need to move on because their are plenty of ppl, besides in this boring valley that are probably wonderful people. Also dating grls is more rough then you would think. Yes they know how other grls feel and even can probably make their sex lives better because they know the right touch, but when it comes to debating, watch out. lol Almost every grl I know loves to be right and usually guys just don't care but for some reasons girls dun give up. Its just one of those things that are hard to explain but if you ever go that way, you are offically warned. You're young but if you really want to be settled down and maybe start a relationship, you need to change a little bit and not go for those people that say they changed but really didn't, let them prove themselves b4 ever getting involved, and dun give them so many chances, no matter how much u think u love them because thats when they start takin advantage and will do it even more. If someone walks into your life that is nice and you know isn't the player person, give them a chance even if you think they are too good for you because it may change you into a more calm settled person and won't be the big time party slut (not sayin you are) that most teens are today. Find someone that is the person you want to be whether you are that person or not, because they will help you to become that person. good luck, and dun be afraid to express your feelings to the person you love or truly like a lot and never let anyone get in the way of that. adios amiga

Lets see, I'm home this semester which means I'll probably be bored with life, but I will be studing my brains out cuz I want to do amazing. Not only do I want to do amazing, but I have to because last semester kicked my butt, FUCK ESU!!!!!!!  sorry I just have a lot of anger for that school and so I'm at LCCC until further notice with RSC in new york. Even tho I haven't attended LCCC yet, They can kiss my ass too. I don't know which school is worst--LCCC or ESU-- they both suck...lol LCCC is cheaper so I like it alil bit better.. haha gotta love live.

I still say to myself ""I'm 18 and out of Highschool"" I just feel like im in a coma or something because I still don't believe it. kinda sad isn't it. I miss all the kids at WA, includin my sisters friends cuz they are soo funny and cute, even tho she didnt want me talkin to them but I mean I made friends with them through other ppl and clubs and stuff so its not my fault. owell.. 

Well im out and everyone have a good day.. i start my classes tomorrow yayyy and my other 2 classes that im takin in WB, don't start til feb, 7... which are night classes.. yayyy because i get to sleep in. kk im really goin this time adios

I haven't even moved there/started school yet, and already I hate it. I just want to leave, basically to run away. If I had to stay home any longer, I may possibly go insane. Memories will not be forgotten, but new places will bring new memories. Some may be bad, but hopefully they will be good. Every year I have a new group of friends, why should this be any different. 

For some reason, I need to let out a good cry. I never cry, rather let it all build up inside, waitin for the perfect time to let it all out. 


Was thinkin about the club tonite, for some reason I feel like that is a bad idea. 

As my sister tells me everyday of my life ""You're a DUMBASS""-- not gunna argue on that one.

My appetite is startin to fade again. Owell, another unplanned diet won't hurt. I need to start workin out again. Its one of the few things that makes me happy about myself.

Tomorrow I definitely need to start tanning. Maybe I'll go shoppin today. I need to call up my gurls that I havent talked to basically all summer. See what they are up to tonite.

"event","Many would say I'm mysterious, but I see different. I see a young, intelligent adult with a dream. A dream to be successful in the future. To live comfortable with a well paying job. Living in an area so beautiful, that you swore it only existed on tv. To look out your window every morning, and realize everything you have accomplished. To know that you were able to face the many obstacles it took to reach this success. 

I see someone afraid to lose this chance of success, by allowing someone to enter their life.  Perhaps opening up to the wrong person and them taking advantage of their kindness. Then having the thought of spending the rest of their life alone. Wanting someone there to help pursue your dreams, without interfering with their own. To live happily and wanting to share this accomplishment with someone you truly care about, trying to form an honest family.

I don't believe my life is a mystery, but rather the direction I want to go. This is what I want and feel. It's all I think about. My future is the only thing I care about. High school is over, now I have to watch every step I take. Allowing people to come into my life, tryin to ruin this for me, is something I don't want. That is why I'm very secure. I have enough confidence in myself to know that life will treat me well, even if it hasnt already.

"event","I feel yukky =(

Past few days, I got a cold for some odd reason. Yesterday was my graduation party, which I really didnt want to attend but had no choice. Since my family loves me, my aunt gave me some liquor. From there, the party was crazy. I dun even remember some of the things I did, but I know it probably wasn't suitable for my family members that I rarely see. Owell I needed to find some way to keep myself entertained.

After my party, went bowling with some people. Did pretty good the first game for bein drunk. Started sobering up by the second, and kicked everyones ass. I'm an athletic person, so I usually do good at stupid sports like that. Lindsey will learn like all the others, don't make bets with me....haha

Went home and passed out. Moments later, I was coughin like crazy and felt very sick to my stomach. My head was pounding, mad cramps, gland was swollen, and my throat was deminished. The more I kept coughin, the more I felt like I was goin to vomit. Definitely ran to the bathroom where I chilled for a very long time. I ate 1 1/2 meals within these 2 days. Lost alil bit of weight, which is a plus.

Went running/walking today with Chelsea after work. Very difficult to do when your throat is killin you and ribs are still fucked up. Chelsea and I really know how to push each other to the limits tho. We are goin to be gym buddies at ESU, can't wait.  =)

Why do you want to deny your feelings? I would never force anything upon you, but the fact I do want answers. There's a reason why you believe I would get hurt. For all you know, I could be the one hurting you. Someone always gets hurt. Thats just the way life is. Are you a totally different person then you make yourself seem? Is there something I don't know about? 

You just leave me soo confused. Yes we have a good friendship, but there's something more. No matter how much you want to deny everything, it will come back to haunt you. I have something really good tryin to be apart of my life, but my feelings tell me different. I know I will eventually move on. One day, when you're done datin all these guys, you will be ready to try something new. Possibly wonderin what outcome could've occurred between us. Maybe when you're ready, I will be there to give it a shot. Chances of that may be high now, but as time moves on, couldn't tell you what I would be feeling then. But if your wish is for me to move on and not look at you in any other way besides a friend, your wish will be granted. Even tho we seem to go through this all the time, but this time will be different because I'm stronger now. 


Sometimes I wish I can turn back time, and never started associating with you. But it happened for a reason. Something told me to talk to you, and invite you out with my crew so you can experience something that you seemed to be very interested in. You once told me that you like attention. Was this all for attention?

Well I'm goin to bed early tonite due to my illness...

Lindsey and I had a wonderful, yet rather weird conversation. Wasn't so much weird, but just the fact that we were talkin about someone else kinda made it weird. Well it did to me anyways, but she was very understanding. Thanks for the advice, even tho I already know the end results to what will happen cuz I'm good like that..haha

I've been trying to be your friend for awhile now. I'm doin a damn good job I think because I always offer everything to help you and/or make you happy. I listen to you and learn more about you everytime we talk or hang out. Of course its killin me because I do care about you still and I know deep down inside you may possibly feel the same. Yea it seems like the only time those feelings come out is when you're with me. I guess I'm just upset cuz I know you would like to experience a successful relationship with someone, but you honestly never told me why you just wanted to be my friend. Yet a part of you can't resist me, which I think is a lie but still. Maybe we need to just have one of our talks like we did that one time. It will possibly help our friendship grow more if that is what you would like. No idea what you want.

Confusion, Confusion... When aren't I confused. Maybe because I've been denying myself, pretending to want and like something else. I even tell myself I don't like girls. Sometimes I believe it but I know thats not the truth. 

The past month has been great, spending time with you. This is for the best and it was a mutual decision. We cleared things up atleast to why we should just be friends for now. Maybe if I wasn't confused still about other things, everything probably would've been better. I just let that subject slip away, hoping it would vanish and never re-enter my brain. I lied... silly mee

Went out with Chelsea and some of the people we hung out with last summer. Oh how I missed them all. I think they cared more about my birthday then I did myself. Maybe because some people got my hopes up for no reason.

It is sad for plenty of reasons. I can't even talk to anyone about anything anymore. To the few people I am able to talk too, I can't tell because it deals with them. I probably said too much to you the other night that I shouldn't have. I guess I really needed to talk to someone and spill out some of my heart. It's going to kick me in the ass.

I'm the girl that doesn't play mind games and tells the truth. There are many feelings I can't deny. I usually date multiple people, but usually end up with one. I can only see one person at a time--less confusion, less pain. Hurting other's is a sin for me. I can't do it and if I do, I put myself into a depression. 

I was quite rude to you the other day, but I did appologize. I just couldn't take the pain anymore. You always left me wondering and it drove me crazy. Didn't think you cared about me, cuz if you did, things probably would've been better. I felt as if the only time you liked me, is when we hung out. I'm glad we got everything settled, but there's one thing that doesn't make sense. After days of thinking and advice from the people who aren't against you, I've decided I can't wait anymore. Somethings are worth waiting for, and thats why I wait for you to finish highschool and wait until you're ready to be in a relationship. Like I told you, A few years ago, the last thing I wanted was a relationship. Highschool relationships suck. Everyone changes their senior year and could careless who they go out with, cuz popularity doesnt matter anymore. Maybe thats why I don't prefer dating younger people, because of those reasons. You are mature for your age, but still have a wild side that I wouldn't want to interfer on. I adore our friendship, and I will be there no matter what. Even when I'm at school and I have millions of essays to write, I would drive here if I'm ever needed. 

I'm glad we have met and became more comfortable with one another. Things got a little bumpy, but we still understand one another. Maybe because we are both way too nice to ever object...haha I always tell you the truth and don't hesitate to tell you what I'm feeling, even when it was about someone else. I couldn't deny anything to you. Last night proved to me that you do care. I was a little scared because I don't want you to ruin your life because of me. When one of your bestfriends told me that they have never seen you like that, I felt as if I was the main reason for your actions. I never had someone soo wasted off their ass still mention my name. Usually everyone else would be drunk, and mention their xgf's, which made me feel as if I was never apart of their lives. Just don't be afraid to be yourself around me. 

I could probably write soo much more about the two, but its just a very confusing situation. I heart both to death and will be by them no matter what. Even if we are all with different people. Both know how I feel because I do talk to both. But it all comes down on who is right for me and not who I think is right for me. I think I made a wise decision and if not, Owell it happens--one of my favorites lines--haha

College is not too far away. Life will get harder at times, but I believe I will like this part of my life better, figuring I've been ready for this my whole life. I will regret not spendin my childhood days like others, but atleast I will survive in the real world. 

For the past week or so, I've been talkin to someone quite special. It's funny how I'm always the last person to know everything. I was clueless for the most part. Why you wanted to hook up with me, beats me. We have soo much in common that it's scary, but in a good way. Of course we get a little nervous around each other at times, because we think we may have found what we were lookin for with out even looking. It's good that we share the same interests and the same friends, even tho I just started becoming close to these people. I got 100% approval from everyone.. haha--didn't even know I was being tested. We definitely love to confuse the shyt out of one another. I dun mean to be confusing but sometimes I can be, But you're just as bad...haha

I needed to date new people. Couldn't keep goin back and havin the same things occur. Atleast you're honest with me about everything. I'm kinda liking this, knowin that you're not using me for sex. The part that I'm a virgin is what scares you the most. Everyone else just wants to take advantage of that. Things will work out for the most part, I can see a relationship forming between us already. Taking it slow will be for the best though. Many already assume we are together..haha

Class day was great--All night party kinda sucked but the hypnotist was awesome. Last night was my daddies 40th bday and had a big party that I was late for cuz I slept all day. The past few days killed me, what can I say..haha-- Got drunk with the family for the hour I was there and chugged as many mixed drinks that I could. Cousin dropped me off at Sara's to drink with her family and Lindsey. Couldn't drink anymore because I was soo wasted. Went skinny dipping...haha Great time... Moss is a party pooper--Finally passed out and I wake up to Andy laying on top of Lindsey and I, that bastard..lol hes a cool guy though.

I was born with a curse on me. No clue why, I'm honestly not a bad person. I would give up my life for anyone and do all that I can to succeed. This bad luck is just keepin me from everything and everyone. Can't even concentrate or think, but rather just stare constantly like I've been drugged up. I know what I am capable of, but never given the chance to prove myself. Why am I here? 

Everyday I wake up, trying to improve from the day before. I've been sheltered my whole life, and let some of the few people I cared about walk away from me. They thought I wasn't interested in them, so they went to something new. Of course I blamed myself for not expressing my feelings because maybe something good may have occurred. Then I thought I need to be more open if I ever thought something more then a friendship could come about. Lets just say that didn't work well either. Everyone just wants to take advantage of me. No-one wants me to be their gf. Well besides Jesse of course...lol 

Everyone has such high standards anymore which drives me crazy. I've given people chances that would never fit my profile. Maybe I should start setting myself these standards. In that case, I would never be anyones gf. It wouldn't make any difference, cuz in either case I'll be single. Yet, no-one will beable to treat me like shyt if I set these standards. 

I yell at myself everyday for being nice to people who don't deserve it. What can I say, I'm usually a happy go lucky girl. But I'm definitely not a lucky girl. There's no reason to be happy anymore. 

To be honest, I have soo many problems right now, as well do others, but there's only one thing that bugs me the most. This has never happened to me before. I usually just walk away from the situation and I get over it. These urges are just drivin me crazy. I wish I could prove and make sense of it, but there are soo many obstacles keepin me from doin that. I just wish people would be soo kind in given me the same opportunity as I give them or as they give others.

Oh yea, by the end of the summer, I will be lookin hott. My body is startin to shape up, I'm gunna start takin care of myself more and makin myself look prettier. Don't worry, I won't make myself look fake cuz I hate fake people. Could careless who I attract cuz I'm done given chances. People gotta work for what they want now ;)

Summer is gunna be crazzay with all my college chicks--they will be given me the heads up before I enter the college life. More then half of them have turned bi, so this should be funn and interesting...haha

I was supposed to call people after the prom, but never did--Owell--I was rather wasted way before they even got done with prom. Plus, most of my friends were goin to her house and she doesn't like me. Why did I drink? I honestly have no idea. I did sleep all day and was rather bored, so that kept me occupied. I ended up hangin out with my brothers friend, and my sisters friend. We had a good time, even if they both tried making out with me. 

The truth definitely comes out when you're drunk. People enjoy gettin the truth out of me. I kinda said stuff that I regret because I don't want people to know. Started from day one, then worked my way til now. I smiled then teared, it kept repeating itself. Yea, a few people know why I've been just a little upset, but I trust them with my words. 

Everyday I am reminded of you. Last night, I said your name hundreds of times. Everytime I said it, I got fustrated and put my head down. Plus I couldn't keep my head up anymore...haha If I didn't say you're name, someone else would ask me about you. Everyday I usually just make up stuff and deny everything if asked certain questions, but yesterday I just kept talkin about my life story. They were ammused and interested as I was slurring my words.

Finally went to the club the other night. I was quite bored at the beginning because I felt as if I was by myself. Then my budday came and kept me occupied until her lover came. My other friends that I missed dearly showed up forever late, wasted of course. Oh how I miss the old days. Definitely met a cutie, my dance partner for the rest of the night. Totally forgot his name and if he would have asked for my number, I would've gave it. Also lost a few pounds from that night. I was starving and my muscles were killing me the following morning. By the way, class pictures were a waste of perfectly good sleep. I made up for it when I got home =)

I give us both credit for that night. We kinda kept our distance from each other most of the night, which felt like we didn't even go together. Which is perfectly fine cuz I kept wondering off with my other friends and you were having fun with your other friends. Of course the 2 drunken ones--aka chelsea and Jenn--asked if you were gunna get mad at me for dancin with them. I started laughin and was like what the hell are you talking about. No matter how many times I tell them we are not together, they consider us together anyways. Just can't win I guess. I don't know, but I had to stay away most of the time incase any bad urges came about from either of us. I just don't want you feeling guilty because of me or feel any sympathy for me. 

I'm sorry if I avoid the subject at times. You definitely need to tell me what you wanted too, because I'm very curious. I just don't want you to give up something that may occur, for me. I'm not worth it, never was worth anyones time. She really cares for you and I believe she will make you happier then I will. I know, I can come in for the kill and possibly win you back, but I just can't do it. We would be perfect together but our friendship means more to me right now. You are probably the only person who ever cared about me for me and not because you think I'm gorgeous, which you do tell me everytime we are together. You see beyond my beauty which no-one else seems to notice. I almost believed someone else did, but I was wrong. We had our problems that are now passed us. I just want to make sure no-one else crosses our minds if we do ever proceed more. 

Right now, I just can't tell the difference between my heart and my brain =/

Need more sleep =)

Our friendship is growin as we speak, yet its perfect already. You changed for the better and I'm proud of you. I'm able to tell you everything and go to you for advice, even tho I confused the shit out of you yesterday. Now you see why I'm confused..haha

I may never understand you. Sometimes I feel as if I'm the only one trying to make this friendship deal work. It's very hard for me to do this all by myself, with out making it look and sound like I'm obsessed. I will not hold the other night against you. I'm just as guilty, which I hate to admit. Nothin has ever compared to how right that felt. For some reason, we kept goin for more. May we be lie'n to ourselves, believing someone will get hurt. Are we just in denial of our feelings. Sometimes I tell myself you do it for my attention. Sexuality crosses my mind a lot. If I were of opposite sex, would things be different? Would you have then tried to win my heart? If you were in my shoes, what would you think? how would you feel? what would you do?--you're still young, when it comes to relationships, you will know exactly what you are lookin for

""I do still have the same feelings toward us just having that friendship. But I want you to know that I really do care about you, even if it is just going to be as friends. And kissing you felt so right.""--Couldn't have said it better myself.

"event","This house has gone mad. I think people find it amusing to pick and make fun of other people, to make themselves feel better. As I just sit here and listen to how ridiculous they sound. Everyone is packin up their things, pretending they will leave, but yet have no where to go. Now I see why I want to go away to school. The only thing I can do, is count the days down until I leave. 

Yesterday was rather deliteful. I missed hanging out with you. We caught up on certain things and brought a smile to one anothers face as usual. Trying to hook me up with some people last night obviously didnt work out because I was rather occupied by someone else. Which wasnt a bad thing because I enjoy their company. I just find it quite funny how they find me irresistible. I tried playin hard to get but I wasn't all there, so it was a little harder then usual. 

That's one topic I will never understand. I never had a friendship like this before. Everywhere we go, we can be several feet away, but people still ask if we are together and that we are cute together and whatever else that they feel like saying. I honestly never had that happen before. When we say we are just friends, they tell us that we have to go out. I usually just laugh because I find it amusing. Sorry to break it to ya kiddos, we're just friends. If they ever want more then a friendship, they will open up to me. Everyone knows that I lock up my heart and when someone states they want to be appart of my life, I'll lend them the key and see where things take us. Of course nothin ever worked out, but I like to give everyone the same opportunity. You never know who is the right one, unless given the chance.

Oh yeaa... We are just as hott together as you are with that sexay beast that doesnt like to wear clothes to the club...haha

Remember, give that a chance before considering to go back to your old ways. She's a great person, just like meeee =)

I'm out... peacee

"event","The past two nights haven't went as planned. The tension that flowed throughout the room last night, made us completely uncomfortable. It was perfectly fine when we were ova Jim's house with just a few of us, when we all left and went to another party, we felt as if we weren't even wanted there. Girls seemed a bit too snotty, even tho some of them were rather cute/hott. Yes, I like meeting new people and makin new friends, but it was very difficult to make friends in a room full of discomfort. When your friend is also scared and wanted to leave, it told us we gotta get out of there now. We felt bad for leaving Jimmy but we didn't wanna stay. I also didn't like someone forcing a beer in my face and forcing me to drink. Beer hasn't been running smooth with my stomach lately and I dun think its worth being rushed to the ER. We tried calling everyone else to see what they were up too, but couldn't come in contact with anyone. 

I tried settling things with a certain other. Things still seem a little off but I'm sure our friendship will grow. Misunderstandings do happen atleast once with every friendship. We just need to overlook those misunderstandings and put them behind us. I just don't want you to run away from me thinkin I want a relationship when I'm perfectly fine with a friendship. I'm the type of person that let things go with the flow and could careless of the outcome. Things happen for a reason. I do appologize for the inconvenience that some of the others have caused due to the fact that they care about me. They still love ya and will not do it again. We may not have did anything spectacular when we hung out, but it's nice to just relax once in awhile, then go teasing others when we feel like being bad..haha When something is botherin one of us that deals with the other, we will have to be smart and talk to each other before we decide to tell a select few. We all know that news travels quick.

Tonight, I'm lookin forward to hangin out with the girls again. We are all hoping that the same person who through the party last saturday, will be doin it again tonite. This time, only girls are invited so we can catch up on things. We all know we love telling bout our lives when we are completely wasted. I don't have much to tell so I'm good to go. 

If nothing occurs tonite, I will be perfectly fine sleeping because its wonderful =)

"event","School has been rather boring, but fun. Seniors get away with murder. Immaturity within my grade will still exist for many years, but will eventually grow up. It's what makes young adulthood entertaining and many realize the responsibility that needs to be taken. 

Graduation is melting down the days. People have changed, but we will all miss each other more than anything. We say we hate one another, but its just a way of expressing the disappointment that has traveled throughout the year. The past few weeks, my friends and I have re-united and enjoyed each others company. Even friends that graduated years before, which we do plan to provide more memories =)

I've been ready for adulthood almost my whole life. I was always ahead of the game and told I'm practically a 30 some year old lady. All of a sudden I'm running scared. Going away to school, which isnt far, but being away from home will be rough. Making my own decisions around a completely new hemisphere may be challenging. Not only makin my own decisions, the fact of me not being around for my family. My sister will be due for her first child a few weeks after I leave, which I may not be around much to help her out. Being away from my mother will be difficult for the both of us because everyone I live with is stubborn. But I'm strong and I have to start worrying about myself and my future, rather then my family and friends. To think I want to get soo far away, such as California, I need to be strong and never look back or I will never proceed forward. 

Last nite, I was told I am too nice to everyone. That's just who I am and I love being nice. It feels good to wake up every morning knowing that I've done something good for someone else. It's a disappointment to me, when everyone fights and hates one another for apparently no good reason. This world is full of hate and I'm one with peace...haha That's why I try and unite people as a whole, with out the drama, to allow a friendship to form. Works most of the time, but some people are just too into themselves and think they are better then the rest. It makes me happy to know I've tried =)

Off to take a lovely nap from a day of boredom...School is a waste of perfectly good sleep..

"event","I've never been soo proud of myself. 

My heart has been diminished by several others--whom I've never expected to proceed more then a friendship with. I'm the type of girl that doesn't go out and looks for love, but rather waits for the perfect moment for love to form between two people. But most recently, I allowed myself to crumble right before my eyes. Tears were constantly rolling down my cheeks because I allow the same stuff to happen again and again, hoping that things would be different. 

Before we ever started hanging out, something in my mind told me to talk to you, perhaps invite you out with my friends and I. Of course I did all of that, but what trickles me the most, you're the one who came onto me. Everything became so confusing for me, which led for all these tears that were formed. It was nice to have finally met someone who isn't all about partying and doin drugs. It's like I have found another me, which made me feel the comfort that I needed. I kept trying to picture us as friends, but I felt as if I was still being led on by the way you flirted and the kisses you kept givin me. We both know you're in love with someone else, but why was it that when you were with me, you made me feel as if we could have more then a friendship, but really you knew that nothin could come about from any of this? To tell you the truth, I don't even know what you felt for me at all. Is it just one of those day crushes, where you completely forget about them the next day? I don't want you to take any of this offensively because I'm not tryin to be mean or make it sound like you're a bad person. The only way someone can hurt someone else in a relationship, is if they go into a relationship with that attitude, thinkin someone will hurt the other. I know you didn't mean anything by any of this, but guys and girls are different and you should know that. Feelings aren't the same and perhaps in the future you may experiment with another girl, but remember its easier to dump guys in the dirt then it is to do that to girls. Don't go breakin too many hearts now =) 

The question is, why am I so proud of myself?
The past few days, my eyes have been waterin up like never before, but I was strong enough not to let them fall. Maybe because now I'm heartless cuz theres nothin left to my heart. Why should I wait for the right person when I know they don't really exist? I should be out having fun, messing around with people to experiment and say the hell with breakin their hearts. The many offers I get from my sicko friends, who will always be my friends, are actually startin to cross my mind. I should just start takin up some of these offers and maybe something good will occur from them. Who knows, but it works for many people. 

It's time to mix up my life a little bit.

"event","ummmm...lets see

Jim and I are completely over. He won't even speak to me anymore because I don't want anything serious as of this moment. Everytime we spoke, it led to an argument. What was I to look forward too? I tried to look beyond all of that, yet he still managed to make me moody. If I were to go out with him, it wouldnt be because I liked him, it wouldve been because he tried makin me feel sorry for him. Which I don't think would be right or fair.

I got use to friends coming and leaving as they please, but I can't believe the closest person in my life, also family, would do the same. You always told me to stay away from people that use me when they have no-one else, and how they only talk to me when its their own convenience. Yet we haven't spoken in days and I've decided to call you to check up on you. May I say you rarely listened to me because you were too busy talkin to your god damn cat, then of course when you wanted to talk, it was a completely different topic that delt with you and of course your lover. The same thing is in replay from last time and if your heart gets broken again, I honestly don't want to listen because I'm soo sick of it. You never want to listen to me when I'm havin problems because everytime I tell you, of course you change the topic and talk about your own problems. The only time you listen to me, is if I fix all your problems and make them all better. Well as of now, you're on your own. Sorry, its life and I could careless if I'm a big part of it or not.

I feel rude and that may sound rude, but its not ok to let people be cruel to me when I've done everything I can for them.

I also want everyone to know how much I love my lil sister jenny =) We've been getting along very well which makes me happy. She's been stickin up for me lately which is a complete shock. It's too bad you gave me the memo about someone a little too late. Maybe that's why you were soo mad when I started talkin to them. owell it happens

I'm out--

"event","Last nite was amazing!!!

I'm soo proud of myself for getting out of my house, looking beyond my pain, and having fun with the many people I enjoy from wyoming area. I definitely needed a night like that. 

Got to see my Sara aka Korny =)
I somewhat still believe I was dreaming, when we had that long talk. I'm still shocked and I'm sure you're shocked as well, to know that I'm exactly the same way. I thought maybe last nite I would be makin out with some guy, instead I'm talkin bout girls and sexuality with people I never exspected to be bi/bicurious. 

Maybe these are all signs? 
I've been tryin to keep my distance from girls that were a little bit on the gay side, but I just can't seem to get myself away. I'm not disappointed because I know I will benefit something from this. I shouldn't have to keep myself away and hide my true identity. I just learned not to let people, whose past that I know and still stands, fuck with my head. The people I've been gettin involved with are a bunch of lesbian players. Some go back and forth with guys and girls and think cheating with the opposite sex is completely ok. Cheatin is all the same. But I gave these people chances because I believe people can change. Yah thats a funny one. It could be that I'm not sexy enough. No clue.. I can only offer so much to people.

I didn't plan on goin to this party and gettin drunk. I'm not the champ that I use to be. But I took it nice and slow at the beginnin and started chuggin those drinks like crazy towards the end. yummy =)

Some may say I'm a bad kid, but really I get told I'm such a good kid. I drink rarely, and thats when I want to. I've been to parties all year without drinking. I don't need to drink to have a good time. Yesterday was a celebration and I don't regret drinkin at all. Drugs are definitely bad for you. I admit to smokin up once in a great while, but I also tried it when I was 17, which I still am today. I said no my whole life but decided one day to try it. Not hooked like most but sometimes I do want it out of anger, which isn't right. 

We all have our problems I guess. Some people are hooked on alcohol, drugs, or sex. Sex is something I have yet to try and I don't know when I'm ever gunna. Most say I should wait for the right one, which I have been, but then you got the ones who wanna take my virginity persuading me otherwise. Owell it happens. Atleast I can live without the other two that I have done =D

Right now I'm just goin out and having fun. I don't need you to stock me like recent guys have done in the past. Giving someone their space without them askin you to, is totally optional and is understandable that you don't want to lose them. But when I ask you for space, sayin that I don't want to talk about our future together because I don't know what I want and that I will tell you when I clear everything up, don't IM me or call me asking me if I thought about everything and what I think and feel for you. That makes me beyond pissed off. Maybe you are all that I need in my life and I can't make sense of it, but don't tell me to drop everyone else for you and argue with me when you think I'm with someone else. I'm single and never stated we were seeing each other. You want to see each other but you can't handle the rumors about me being with someone else, when we arent even an item yet. This is why I hate men. Not all because we do have a few gentleman in this world. 

Just want to state that I LOVE EVERYONE that I was with last night. My name will never be forgotten... haha

My Pee'n buddies were great--sara n jess--
Sara, we will make out another day, I promise. We will soon be each others new make out partners ;)

off to eat then sleeping half the day away b4 I have to finish up my essays =/

"event","I'm soo confused with this world. I don't know where I stand or why I exist. Do I go out with you to deny my sexuality, or do I continue this path and allow myself to get treated ridiculously? I know which one I prefer but I gotta think of what's best for me. But lately that's been very hard for me to do. I can't even make a simple decision anymore without making it into a whole thinking concept. 

I know this may sound crazy, but I never felt comfortable with a man. As a friend yes, but anything more I always felt weird. 

Whyyyy me? How could I allow myself to even think about ever dating a grl? Why have I allowed people to corrupt me, to make me think I would be happier this way? Grrrr ::yells at self::

One more week of school left and I'm very excited, but sad. Got a good last look at the faces at my lunch, and realized how much I will miss many people and the fact my life is in my own hands and I have to make decisions based on myself and not on others. I will definitely miss brittany, don't ask why, she was a good time. I know after I leave the halls of wyoming area, I may never see her again. Well that is what my sister told me and I kinda do agree. No clue where anyone will be this summer. Hopefully I will be down ESU as much as I can with a few friends that attend there and whoever I bring along with me. 

Haven't heard from ESU yet, makes me very scared. I will just jump off a bridge if something goes wrong where I can't attend there this fall. No clue what I'm goin to school for anyways. I may just become a prostitute or a stripper.. or both...haha

<font size=""-2"">[1-2] These images were retrieved from <a href=""http://katamari.namco.com/"">the official Katamari site</a>. <3
[5-6] Messing with contrast and such then the original image. The quotes on the Psychonaut images are quotes from the actual game.
[7] I take no credit for this quote: it was all my friend Jess. Blame her for any mind scarring that may have occured.
[8-10] I thought MirrorMask was fucking great, but then again I haven't ran into something by Neil Gaiman that I DIDN'T think was fucking great. The man is my literary god. Oh, and Valentine ftw kthnx.
[11] A remake of a MUCH older icon, one of my first. I almost liked it enough to put it up here, but then I just had to update it. Sir Didymus ftw too!
[12-15] I finally saw Velvet Goldmine and I thought it was an awesome movie. <3 So have Velevet Goldmind icons. 13 and 14 are not identical, one of them has a veryvery light word on them... but if you can't see the word, just use 13.
[16-18] Images by VG Cats. First two from the random other comics section, and Aeris from <a href=""http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=171"">The PUNisher</a>.
[20] Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins, the minds behind <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/"">Penny Arcade</a>. And they are two of my idols, not only for making a funny, SUCCESSFUL webcomic, but also what they've done with that success -- namely PAX and to a greater extent, Child's Play.</font></center></lj-cut>

Happy Christmas and a Merry New Year, everybody! ^_~ My last icon post of the year. I could say I'm disappointed that this hadn't garnered more attention, but I never really expected it to, and I certainly feel accomplished after finishing up each one of these journals. Anyhow, enough whining from me -- enjoy the icons!

[10] An original character of mine, Kaia.
[11-27] All of these images are copyright VG Cats. I just added the words.

[30] From Dir en Grey's performance at the Family Values Tour in Dallas, Texas. I BELIEVE my friend Susan got this shot.

"event","Welcome to the grand opening of fishicons, the one and only LJ for the Goldfish of Evil's many and fairly unoriginal icons. The title comes from a combination of the nickname Fishie and icons, thus making... Fishicons. Heh.

So stay tuned (HAH!) for icons to come!

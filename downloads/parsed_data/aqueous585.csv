"event","well a lot has happened since the last time i thought about writing in a journal....just a refresher....im now a freshman at uab, which so far has been one of the worst decisions of my life.  i was so stubborn when i was going through the college application process and only sent all of the necessities to one school and that was uab.  i got accepted and i thought college was going to be great.  i had a few friends already at uab, i had a steady job, and i still had my parents to fall back on.  well now that its in full swing, i see my errors in thinking.  it turns out i really dont have that many friends at uab, just a few guys from work who i occasionally talk to and then my older brother erick.  my job has gone into a downward spiral since new management came in, and i have made zero new friends at uab.  i can finally see exactly what my problem is.  i have been doing things for other people my whole life and since i quit playin sports in 11th grade, i havent done too much for myself.  this is about to come to an end.  i was eating dinner with my parents a few weeks back and i told them i wasnt liking where i was, and they told me that this is the time in my life to do what i want to do, so i brought up transferring.  at first, they were very enthusiastic about it, but lately they have taken the stand that they think im transferring for all the wrong reasons, such as going there to be with my high school friends.  for one, i could care less about most of my friends from high school.  i wouldnt care if all but like 4 or 5 fell off the face of the earth.  my reasons are that im finally ready for something new.  whats left to do in hoover?  ive been through 6 different schools since ive lived here, played 3 different sports and ive had 2 different jobs.  im ready to meet tons of new people, live in a different place for once, and finally get out on my own and do something for myself.  a long journal entry, yes, but watever, my point has finally been said exactly how i wanted"

i just want to let you know what i really think and some real truths because there is no reason to hide this shit nemore.  your many lectures to me about the choices ive made have had no effect on me at all.  have you noticed that every time you would bring this shit up id get pissed off at u and tell u to shut up and you would press on ur point and id give up and just tell u to fuck off.   you would never do it though.  you kept fucking preaching about bullshit and you act like you know what youre talking about but you really have no clue because all you hear are the stories that have been twisted and turned until theyre not even close to the truth and you base what u know off that.  fuck that bullshit, get out and find out what really happened.  well nvm cuz nobody would tell you becuase you have a big mouth and you talk about gross shit all the time, like your granny fantasy bullshit.  thats fuckin nasty and then you go and say stuff like the 8th grade science teacher was hot....thats also nasty......and you tell me about why you hate every single decent looking girl at our school.  cuz they dont do what you expect of them so theyre whores or bitches or one of the many names youve called em all.  and, lastly, tell me once again why im a conformist, becuase youve never given me a good reason before you just keep saying you know you are.  neways.....marcel.....me and my ""dumb ass crew"" are gonna go party somewhere and you can just sit your fuckin faggot ass at ur house or coldstone like you do every other second of ur life.

"event","yeh so this weekend has been really long.  i got my older brother erick to check me out of school at 12 and me and adam (checked out too) went to his sister's house in bessemer.  i had to be at work at 4 so i left there and went to work.  it was easy and i got off and drove the exploder out to beer lake.  me and scott boxed and the 1st round i kinda did this bullrush thing and i won the first round but in the 2nd round he got 3 really good pops and i just said fuck it i cant box when im drunk.  i left beer lake and went to to sleep at like 2.

friday was one of the longest days of my life. i woke up and wasnt really doin nething and ben marsh called adam and said he got stuck out by beer lake (dumb ass).  i drove out there and ben was stuck pretty good.  it started to drizzle and i wasnt gettin the exploder stuck in the woods so i just left and went to meads house.  we went to cicis and ate and then left and rolled up like an 18 inch blunt (4 blunts long).  craziness.  at like 3 in the mornin we were hungry and we all went to eat and after that we went to jordan pearce's house in greystone and didnt leave greystone till like 7:30 in the morning and i slept till like 12.

yesterday was gay i dont wanna write about it.  the only cool part was playin basketball.

today i got work all day. damn."

"event","a hot topic lately ive noticed is ppls choices to drink or do drugs.  the argument is close to the end but either way id like to give my opnion on it.

drinking and smoking and pills and whatever other fuck-up substance u can think of is a person's personal choice to do.  i consider it bein nosy and it pisses me off when ppl get into my personal business, and therefore when somebody tries to tell me not to drink beer because im poisoning myself, i get pissed.  do u really think i dont know?  do u think that every1 who drinks is irresponsible to the point that they are gonna overdo it and die from alcohol poisoning?  no, in most cases of drinking, people know their limits, and thats really all u need is to be responsible with it.  dont drink and drive cuz thats just plain retarded but in my opinion drinking or smokin pot is done purely for fun and if ur responsible with it then i dont think theres a problem with it.

now let me say this; if ur a ""straight edge"" and u want to comment and tell me how stupid i am for what i do, then im telling u to go fuck urself right now

later

"event","haha wow i never thought id live to say that im looking forward to a monday morning, but this is it.  starting with friday night this was a pretty bad weekend.  friday i worked and had to come home right after becuase of the ACT on saturday morning.  the act wasnt that bad, it was just really long and i hope i dont have to take it again.  saturday i clocked into work at like 1:30 and left at 10:30.  my curfew is 11:30 and i was grounded so even if i had wanted to go out i couldnt have.  today, went to church and worked again all day.

kelly is a fucking prick, he left a note on bryans desk tellin him to give me 0 hours next week, but thats actually fine with me im so tired of my job that it will be good to have a break.

for some reason im kind of in a good mood.  maybe its cuz this weekends over but i am.  rare occasion these days.

dude ne1 who went last year we need to go check out the rope swing.  i was thinkin bout that today and we def need to try that shit out cuz it was fun as hell.  also need to check out the quarries but the rope swing 1st.  o yeah, my minds running we should head out to beer lake.  nething that comes close to the last time we were there would be completely awesome.

thats all i got for ya, sorry

i think we have 5 weeks of school left.  its something short like that.

shit lately i have been a person of mood swings.  i cant stay happy and i cant stay mad.  my mood is constantly changing and its really pissin me off cuz i feel like im just bein a drama (king?)  for like an hour ill be on top of the world and then for no reason i get pissy and bitchy.  wtf is up with that?

neways today was a school day so naturally it sucked.  it was slow and i was so worn out from goin to sleep at 8 in the mornin on saturday that i couldnt comprehend a thing.  teachers were asking me questions and id just be like uhh what was the question?  doesnt look like thats gonna change cuz i got the ACT test on saturday morning, then i gotta work from 12-8.  the ppl at that country club piss me off.  youve got kelly, who has said hes wanted me fired twice in past 2 weeks, but i dont care about him.  then john, the woman, and bryan, the cock who gave me too many hours this week (24).

i didnt really write that much about it on my last entry, but prom was a really cool night.  me n hunter picked up viv and tiff at 5:30 and we went to david dunns and took pictures.  then we went n ate at the copper grill n went to the harbet center.  that was fun as hell but dunn was bored so he called the limo driver at like 10:30 so we had to leave an hour early.  we went back to dunns and watched without a paddle and went to drop tiff and viv off, but yeah mr roberts was in a good mood for some reason (hmmm) so he wanted to go make a fire in the woods.  the problem was it was 3:30 in the morning, but that was cool with all of us, so we piled into dixie (mr roberts ranger) and went mudd ridin for a few hours.  we finally got the fire started, but i was too tired to care and i didnt pay much attention to it.  we finally left the woods at like 6 in the morning and went home, but still it didnt stop.  me hunter viv and tiff went to waffle house and came back at 7:30 and finally went to sleep and woke up at like 12:30.  i was feelin kinda sick so i called into work and just chilled all day.  it was a badass weekend."

"event","today was one of those days for me when everything a teacher says goes in one ear and out the other b/c other stuff has just been on my mind.  im 17, just one more school year away from college.  these days are filled with driving myself wherever i need to go, worryin about stuff like getting my car taken away or wrecking it (again) and other stuff like who is real and who is fake and stuff that just didnt matter to me 2, 3, and 4 years ago.  i kinda miss things like sneakin out of my house at midnight to go meet somebody and roll somebody, or runnin around the neighborhood worryin if a cop is gonna come by and call our parents b/c we were out too late.  high school had been like nothin but like a big ass problem with grades, teachers, friends, and other shit that you never even thought about working up a sweat over.  i know im not the only one who takes a trip down memory lane every now and then, but when u do think about these kind of things you get kinda pissy, and thats added to the bullshit that goes on in every day life.  my good mood from a few nights ago is completely gone and has been replaced by another thinking mode.  so neways leave a comment and ill talk to yall later

"event","yeah so i thought today was gonna be the worst day in a long time (being the 1st day back from spring break and having the ACT prep course) but today was a pretty cool day.  in spanish i watched finding nemo which meant no work, even tho the movie was in spanish and i didnt catch a word of it.  chemistry, boring as usual, but no homework.  math, well every1 knows i blow at math.  its a week into the 9 weeks and i have a 54 in it.  art was easy like usual.  history...same english same basketball same.  i think the ACT prep is gonna help b/c the dude teachin us is a good ass teacher.

after the long day at school i went to hoover high with hunter and we picked up viviann and tiffany and went to chick fil a and then i went and picked up my tux.

i am getting back into rap music b/c of the new 50 cent and eminem cds.  they are both badass.

well im in a good mood tonight, hopefuly it lasts.  im out peace

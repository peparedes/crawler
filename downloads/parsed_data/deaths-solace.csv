The painting is basically a big oval, not much more I could fit in than this, b/c I was running into my niece's dresser or stereo system on the oppisite wall.

"event","Anyway I got sick that afternoon and thought I couldn't go, but got better at home a few hours later. And my thoughts did shift to the civic center because Meg asked me to go, but I couldn't do that. . . .morals and all.

So I got there at like 6:30 - 7pm (I have no clue).And I helped to serve the survivors and all (it was sad, there were hundreds)And walked around the track, which was the symbol purpose,not to stop walking until 8am the next day.There I sa Rachel(walked with her a long time) and Tate and yadda yadda etc.

It all started when we went to get pictures, so little boys came over trying to pimp us, lol. It was Ashley, Kim, Jessica, Brandy, Brittany, Amanda Bare, and Me, everyone else had left by then. We only met them because we were taking group pictures. Well this 16 year old started stalking us, I cannot remember his name. . .ohh well. 

Right well we are all doing stuff, munching, putting Mrs. Langone in prison, dancing, walking track and talking. We all end back up at the camp, eventually, who knows when. Well that boy ends up there, sick ass perverted boy. We tried everything, pretending we were all lesbians, telling him how we would kill him (man we said we would tranquilize him, and he said he would do it to us and rape us. . . wow), saying we had to go, tried using the teacher to get him away. . . didn't work.

At one point Kim and Jessica started running from him, and when I was with them we got him to turn and we started running off (It didn't work either). Boy even took his shirt off ON MY BLANKET!! So when he is away we meet Amber and Angelica, he stalks them too, but at school (Cummings) and they ended up staying with us until they went to bed. Nice chicks. 

Well that's when we went and got twister and Ashley can chick anyone's ass in that game. Of course you know who shows up at the same time, insisting to play, we find he split his pants(which they had been for hours, but I forgot to tell everyone, because we having to much fun being mean), thus we dubbed him rainbow(for his boxers). Mrs. Langone was laughing so hard, it was so hilarious. Then he goes and changes his pants, into some tight pants, and Brandy is like don't split these. And Mrs. Langone busted out again. Rainbow left for a while and won Ashley stuff in bingo, and we picked on him some more. . .that boy just didn't have a clue. 

Then we met Arron (from Cummings too, friends with the girls). Whitest boy we ever met, but he was so much fun, and we thought Rainbow got the clue, we didn't see him anymore. And we talked and pranked until about 5 am, when Jessica, Ashley, and Kim left (the were supposed to leave at 10pm, lol)
 
That is how much fun we had, well Rainbow came around again, and he finally got the clue to leave. Then we toppled the tent on Brandy it was so funny because we couldn't get it to fall, but when we sat down the thing just collapsed. By that time it was morning, and we didn't sleep at all, I got home at 9am and slept until 6pm. We got the crap down, then finally at about 7:30 we got all the stuff down. I talked to Amber, Arron, and Angelica one more time, then I went to sleep and here I am.

Nevermore

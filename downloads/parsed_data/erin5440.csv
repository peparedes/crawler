"event","so i'm feelin pretty shitty today. from the events of the past few days. i drank alone last night and got very very high and passed out.  needed to numb myself.  i never smoke weed but i have some handy for those O SO ""SPECIAL"" occasions that make me feel like dirt.

so i'm going to se the milwaukees tonight afterall.  it was a hard decision to make being that i keep gagging and almost throwing up cause my thoughts are making me so nauseous.  but nothing will come up.  because of that i told my brother i wasn't going and he yelled at me ""you fucking do this everytime, every show, i'm not going with u to anymore shows, ask me again to go to a show""  BLAH BLAH BLAH!  so i spoke to my friend who was actually my bros friend first and said if he goes i'll go.  cause i'm just not in the mood to deal with my bro and his girl alone.  i'm so angry and agitated and my hands are tight and i can't think straight.  it's not a 3rd wheel night for me.  and a whole hour drive or maybe over an hour to asbury park with just them 2 didn't help the matter.  so anyway my friend said he'll go so i'm going.  even though i feel like puking in the face of three very special bois. fuckin jackasses.  at what age is it that boi's turn into men, i would really like to know so i can set my dating age limit."

"event","so i been ""seing"" this guy for over a year and a half and just a lil while ago i ask his cuz where he is and he says ""with his 'girl',  eatin dinner with her parents, they aren't together, they're just seeing each other""  i asked him how often does he see this chick and he says ""often"".  mean while i haven't seen him since august. and hes been using the exuse ""oh i'm so busy with my band and job, i don't get a chance to see anyone""  yea right eat a dick. apparently u have plenty of time to see this other chick.  so this means i mean dick to him.  real nice.  i fucking love my life.  wasted over a year.  i seriously have no idea what i am doing in this world.  i don't have a clue about anything.  i usually just hook up here and there (no sex).   so i decided to stop that and just try settin my goals on one guy.  that didn't work.  so i went back to being me ""g0 h03"" as my friend so sweetly put it.  but at least i'm not a full hoe.  i just don't know what to do anymore.  i hooked up with another guy and he says he wants to hang out but i know hes still seeing somoen.  he hasn't called yet or anything.  hes mad sweet.  i known him for a while.  why don't he just call.  like whats wrong with me?  i dunno.

"event","and yEs i know i spEll boi wrong.


so i met this ""boi"" saturday i say boi cuase hes 22.  but swears hes much more mature i disagree.  and i shall prove it.  from the events in the past few days.  so i met him saturday night at the wicked monk, which can be sometimes the equivilant to hell.  he seemed so sweet, y else woudl i give a 22 year old guy my number, me being 24 and turing 25 in 3 and 1/2 months. ok so he called me monday i missed his call so i called him back tuesday.......


TUESDAY:
""thats so discusting"" his Emotions actually stirrEd whEn i told him i datEd a black guy whEn i was 18. hE was about to stop talking to mE right thErE and this bEing thE first convo wE had on thE phonE. ""thE only rEason why black guys datE whitE woman is to gEt thEm prEgnant and ruin thEir bloodlinE"" EXACT QUOTE PEOPLE!!!! ""no rEal whitE guy would want to datE you aftEr tElling him that. and if hE doEs say hE still wants to datE you it's only bEcausE hE wants to 'bang you out''. ""i grEw up in starrEtt city, i sEEn what thEy donE to my family. 95% of thEm arE bad. bad unlEss thEy grEw up in a whitE nEighborhood"". ""no whitE guy willrEspEct you if you tEll thEm that"" ""lock that sEcrEt away"". ""takE a word of advicE and don't EvEr tEll a WhitE guy that or hE won't rEspEct you"". all this from a guy i mEt at a bar saturday. 

ok so i'vE bEEn askEd thE ""havE you EvEr datEd a black guy?"" quEstion b4 but nEvEr havE i got a rEsponsE likE that. this is why i hatE cErtain brooklyn guys. thEy think thEy rulE thE fucking world. i thought our gEnEration was past this bullshit but i guEss not. hE was raisEd a cErtain way i guEss. but so was i, my dad wasn't too happy about mE dating that guy back in 1998. but i didn't turn into a racist likE this kids parEnts madE him. don't pEoplE havE thEir own minds in this gEnEration. it litterally madE mE sick to my stomach whilE hE was sayin all this. as hE was tEllin mE ""oh that so gross, 'i'm sick to my stomach"". HE'S sick to HIS stomach. what a jokE. and u know what onE of thE last things hE said was ""I DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE"" it was so hard to hold in my hystErical laughtEr by that point. 

i just don't undErstand how pEoplE can think likE this. gEt so angry at somEonE that thEy don't EvEn know for dating somEonE of a diffErEnt racE back whEn thEy wErE 18 EvEn. EvEn if it was yEstErday, whAT FUCKING RIGHT DOES HE HAVE. PEOPLE ARE FUCKING PATHETIC IN THIS WORLD. i would likE hElp him changE his mind but thosE kind of pEoplE are stubborn and nEEd to hElp thEmsElvEs. i can't vEnt anyonE causE i can analizE this till it doEsn't Exist anymorE. i'll bE hErE all day.

hE said hE was sorry for gEttin mad whEn hE told mE this, but thats just how hE fEEls.
but if hE can gEt mad ovEr that thEn what ElsE can hE so Easily gEt mad ovEr. 




WEDNESDAY:
today hE says that whEn hEs with a girl hE don't want hEr going out to bars with hEr firEnds without him. causE all pEoplE do at bars is to pick pEoplE up. 

i totally disagrEE. causE the first guy thats EvEr pickEd mE up at a bar and i go to bars all thE fucking timE.

i laugh at my friEnds that go out with guys that arE likE this. i fEEl sorry for thEm. no onE pErson should havE any rulE in what anothEr pErson doEs. thats what thErE is ""trust"" for. i dunno. maybE hE has trust issuEs. but what thE hEll am i doing? i havE somEonE 1000 timEs bEttEr. if hE would just call mE that would bE grEat, so i could finally hang with him. i know hEs busy working n stuff but i dunno i just want my chancE is all.

i'll add morE to what this kid said whEn i can fucking comprEhEnd my own thoughts. right now hEs just around for amusEmEnt purposEs. tomorrow i tEll him to grow up. i just havE troublE with lEtting pEoplE down. so its hard to say. i dunno. BLAH!!!

FakePlasticLov3 [4:09 PM]:  i mean if i went with the flow i think that would be selfish of me cuase i strongly disagree with his views 
FakePlasticLov3 [4:10 PM]:  it would be me just not wanting to be lonely

FakePlasticLov3 [4:31 PM]:  that was so easy 
FakePlasticLov3 [4:32 PM]:  he was like oh u hungry cause i'll come pick u up now and we could go eat and hang for a lil bit casue i get mad shit to dolater. 
FakePlasticLov3 [4:32 PM]:  i was like listen

FakePlasticLov3 [4:33 PM]:  hes like u think i would call u? 
FakePlasticLov3 [4:33 PM]:  i'm like i don't care 
FakePlasticLov3 [4:33 PM]:  he says thats not the right thing to do 
FakePlasticLov3 [4:33 PM]:  so ignoring you is?  i says 
FakePlasticLov3 [4:34 PM]:  he goes...take it easy... take it easy 
FakePlasticLov3 [4:34 PM]:  so i hung up 
classified[4:34 PM]:  assholes
FakePlasticLov3 [4:34 PM]:  and he thinks hes grown 
classified[4:34 PM]:  werd



so all in all i feel much better now that i called him and told him that i don't think this is gonna work.  and for him to say that was ""the wrong thing to do""  just shows how immature he is. its called respect moron. he definitely has trust and respect issues.  i'm glad i ended that b4 it started."

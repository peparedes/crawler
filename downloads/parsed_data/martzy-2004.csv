"event","yes, livejournal has slipped my mind for the past few months. I have been writing in my real journal as an attempted to not go crazy with myself.  Things are going ok.  On my own again; working at Broken Top outside stuff and enjoying it ok.  Still extremely unsure about what I am doing with my life.  I hope I can make enough money this summer to be able to go to Botswana, Africa as I have dreamed since my freshman year in high school. There are a million things I rather do now than go to school its just a matter of having money to do so I am going to work my butt of this summer so I can makes these dreams realities.  I miss Julie alot. Most definitely one of the hardest parts about not being in Alaska.  I have been going to the chiropracter for a couple weeks now, and my back is feeling better some days and not too good other days.  Being not able to fall asleep because my back hurts so bad in every position is not too much fun anymore.  Sleeping, haven't done much of that lately.  So then I end up taking 2.5-3hr long naps in the afternoon after work which I know isn't too healthy.  I've got to get by though.  I am definitely read for springtime weather.  Today at work it started snowing so we got to go home which was nice because I was in no mood to work today.  I guess that's all for now. Peace"

"event","Well, today was an odd day. I woke up and babysat for 3 hours then sat around all day at my house....I made some lemon bars and watched a movie. It felt so nice to do absolutely nothing.  Wow, now that I have started I am really not into this whole journal thing. Oh yeah I cried, more like sobbed for an hour and half last night. That was fun. Haha no. Sometimes I wish someone else could make my decisions for me because everyone that knows me knows that I don't.  Ok, I think I'm off to bed. Night. :)"

"event","So, I sit here, downstairs at Anna's house.  She is cleaning the garage, and although we did not plan a logical progression she does seem to be progressing somewhat.  I am really hot can literally feel the heat radiating off my body.  The Oregon Duck football game is on.  I didn't even know they had games this early in August.  Shows you how much I know.  I only have 5 million things to do before I go to Alaska, but I am not even going to think about it.  I hope to get into the dorms.  That would make life so much simpler.  I ordered Breathe and Stop last night.  It will be sent to Troy's house so we can sit and speculate upon our friends Zach and Timbo together.  I miss him tons.  It sucks because we don't really talk that much since I left Alaska.  It was really hard to talk when I was in Minnesota because of the 3 hour time difference.  I am really excited to go there, but I do wish I could just skip the next 2 weeks and have everything done and be ready to go.  Ok, I'm done for now.  PEACE"

"event","So, here I sit, with my 16 Lander family members who are here while they watch family vidoes of my mom and uncles when they were little.  I am supposed to be watching, but instead am talking on msn, emailing anna, and searching newschoolers.  Wow, I am a failure.  Haha.  This vacation has been fun.  Jesse and Michelle's wedding was a blast.  I love seeing my Mondry family members.  I fit in with them so well, and feel loved and part of a family.  Everynight when I lay down in bed after talking to Troy, I think about all the stuff I have to do back in Bend before I leave for Alaska.  I will only be home after this vacation for 10-12 days.  Not even 2 weeks, and it will go by fast.  I still am wondering if I am making the right decision but I feel like I am.  I have talked to tons of family members about it and all have been very positive and excited for me.  I really can't think of one person who was totally against it and negative, so that has been VERY reassuring.  Today we were in the car and my uncle asked Eli and Amelia if they were anxious to get rid of me and they both eagerly said no.  That made me super sad because I will truly miss them the most.  I know I will miss going to Saturday soccer games of my sisters and sharing XC meets with Eli.  And sitting in the Summit gym reeady to shoot myself because of how the basketball team is doing.  I will be able to watch some though.  I definitely think fall will be the hardest.  Troy has to come home with me this winter so he can meet my family.  I told my aunt Jill I was going to marry him.  She believed me and that was nice.  Me and her drove over here from North Dakota so we got a chance to talk about lots and lots of things.  It was really good. I needed it because she understands me so well, and especially about my dad. Time for bed. ! Marita !"

"event","So tomorrow morning I am again venturing on vacation.  This time to Minnesota and N. Dakota.  I am not really excited but I know once we fly through fucking Arizona to get to Minneapolis, I will be glad I'm there.  But seriously, Arizona? What the hell.  Oh well.  Today was a really good day.  I hung out with Anna pretty much all day.  And Erica at the end of the day.  I love both of them so much.  Anna and I saw some guy get arrested in the park.  We also made up new words to a song.  We are muscians.  Haha.  I got a new shirt at Local Joe with the rest of my gift certificate.  That place is rediculous.  $40 for a flipping shirt, I'll take Goodwill thanks.  :) I get to see lots of family who I haven't see in 3 years so that will be progressive.  Of course they are all going to ask me where I am going next year and I will tell them Alaska and they will think I'm psycho.  Oh well, life goes on.  Everyone chooses their own paths and everyone else should accept the path they choose.  Ok, that even confused me.  Moving on.  Tim shit out a worm today.  Poor kid has to get back on the boat tomorrow with a fucking tape worm in his stomach.  Troy is taking care of him I hope.  I would be if I was there, but Troy is a good ""take care of"" person.  I love him to death.  Oh yes, one more thing. Today I had the worst cramps ever I could barely walk and I wanted to rip my lower abdomen parts out.  But then I realized I might need them later.  Anna and I figured out that with our periods, we are miserable about 3 months out of every year.  Think of how many years that is for a girl.  How unfair.  OK, now that I grossed out anyone besides Anna, I think I might go speculate some more on NS.  God bless, peace out, I'm on a no ice cream diet.  ~Mutz"

I really really want to go to Alaska but I had a long talk with my dad at dinner and he really doesn't think that it's a good idea.  The darkness, being so far away, and not living in the dorms are his major concerns.  I don't know what to do.  Now I am worried about whether or not I am making the right decision.  I have to go to Alaska.  If I stay here for another year I will be miserable and I am definitely not going to Linfield.  I miss Troy so much and it kind of sucks because I really haven't talked to him much lately and when I do Tim is usually distracting him.  OK this website is freaking out.

"event","Wow! It's been a long time since I have posted any speculations in here.  I have since been to Alaska, fallen in love, and now sit in Bend at my computer with a head full of thoughts.  My trip to AK was absolutely wonderful.  I finally met Troy.  Getting off the plane in Anchorage I was so scared, nervous, and anxious I thought I might die.  Turns out everything was fine.  The whole situation turned out way better than I could ever hope for.  Nothing really went wrong, except for the fact that I had to leave.  Definitely one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.  Stay in the security line and not run for it.  I first of all hate airplanes, but second, could not bear to leave this boy.  I look back on my life from today back and I have come a damn long way.  New friends, new loves, new trials, new everything.  I am a much much stronger person and I am almost thankful for what I went through.  I am now ready to make the trek to Alaska.  I need to.  For myself.  I need out.  I missed Tim while I was there but figures that 5 days after I leave he comes to town. What the fuck.  Oh well. Tim and I know it's all part of big plan.  :) I will see him for sure in August when I return.  Wow, like less than 20 more days in Bend.  My mom, brother, sister, and I are leaving on wed for Minnesota/ N. Dakota for a week and a half.  I hate the fact that I have to get back on another airplane but I'm sure it will be fun.  My wonderful cousin Jesse is getting married.  A Mondry wedding, too much fun.  Let me see, last Mondry wedding I as 15 and sat at the bar and got drinks bought for me the whole night.  I wonder what it will be like this time; I'm sure very much the same.  Then a reunion on my Mom's side of the family.  That will be fun too.  Not too much progression though; except in the category of wakeboarding, tanning, and bug bites.  I can't wait to go back to Alaska.  I miss everyone there and I know that the choice I'm making is right.  I can always come home, I can't always go to Alaska and progress there.  Troy, if you are reading this...You mean more to me than you will ever know; I love you to the top of the tall ski jump and back.  Tim, keep up the progression, prayers, and fish catching.  Anna, you are one of my favorite people ever, thanks for all the support and fun times.  I love all three of you soooo much.. Peace out for tonight...MUTZ ;)"

There was tons of good food and great friends.  I honestly wasn't looking forward to it that much but after the fact I was and still am so happy about it.  Now I am sitting here in my sweatshirt and sweatpants and I am so content.  All I need now is a plane ticket to Alaska.  I talk to Tim and Troy today.  I miss the boy.  Tracy came to my party and it was so nice to see her.  It meant alot to me.  Anna, Naime, Hannah, Mariah, Megan, Blake, Cally, Sara..... I love them all so much and I hope they know that and never forget it. Poor Blake, with her teeth, I feel so bad because I know how bad it sucks.  Crap, I have to work tomorrow.  I took 6 days off and now it's super hard to want to go back. Yuk.  OH Anna.. I love you, and I am always here for you and I am so sorry you had to go thru all this shit.

No school tomorrow and it's the last day the mountain is open.  I should ski.  I'm going to.  All by myself but I love it like that. Hopefully the weather is nice.  Check-out on Tues.  I also have to finish my math final.  That sucks.  I think about it all the time, but I literally cannot belive I'm graduating from high school.  Went to church today with my bro, sis, mom, and grandma.  It was really nice; something I definitely needed.  All these things are  happening in my life right now and I can't control them but I'm ok with that. I know The ONE above is in charge.  I hope Anna's doing alright.  I miss her and Tim.  Hopefully we will be able to hang out alot this week.  Had a glass of wine with my mom tonight.  It was funny.  I drank it with a straw and my whole family and my neighbors were making fun of me.  I guess I'm just spontaneous like that.  I looooove it.  So I'm going to Alaska to look at a college.  It's so weeyad and random but that it totally fits my personality.  It feels right too so I'm going to do.  I really have no dier need to go to Linfield.  I don't want to be like everyone else and just go to a nice college, and be there.  I want to do something crazy that will broaden my horizons.  Be away from everyone I know and just learn about life and myself.  I hope Erica is coming home soon.  I can always use her advice.

Now he's freaking getting married.  What the fuck.  Speaking of which, Dan is in town until Wed.  I want to see him, but it's just soooo weird.  Dan...married..no way in hell.  I think back to last year.  That person I know/knew sooo well is getting married.  I constantly think of all the shit we went through and all he did for me.  Amazing that a person would do that for someone else.  There is no way I could EVER thank him.  Only 9 more days of high school.  9 more days of Bend High.  9 more days of the faces I have seen for 4 years.  It's exciting but at the same time really awkward.  A new chapter in life is starting.

I started thinking about how next year at Linfield I won't be able to ski and I'm not too down with that whole idea.  So, maybe I'll stay here.  I love Bend so much and when I think of leaving it makes me really sad.  I am so scared to go to college.  What if I don't fit in, what if I have no friends, what if I get bad grades.  The whole situation is sketchy to me.  It was a beautiful day at the mtn.  I wished I could have skied with Tim and Anna, hopefully I will be able to tomorrow.  My mom and brother are in Salem for the day.  Eli is playing basketball.  I love my brother so much.  He is such an awesome person.  It makes me sad to see him unhappy with basketball at Summit.  I pray things will get better for him.  He's doing awesome in track.  He had never ran the 110m high hurdles and now is going to districts for them.  I wish I spend more time with him because I love hanging out with him.  I'm going to work on that.  Only like 9 more days of high school!!! Yippy!! Wow, it's gone so fast.  I have met so many great people, shared many wonderful memories, and learned alot of shit.  I listened to ""Scientist"" by Coldplay this morning.  I LOVE that song. ""Nobody said it was easy,It's such a shame for us to part.Nobody said it was easy,No one ever said it would be this hard.Oh, take me back to the start.""

 The piano part at the beginning always brings tears to my eyes.  It's amazing how music touches my soul.  I definitly could not live without it. 
 I'm sad Tim is leaving in less than 2 weeks.  I have spent alot of time with him lately and he's going to be gone all summer.  Who am I going to speculate with, make wierd noises with, golf in the front yard with, try to chop skis in half  with, bring ice cream to after work, pray with??

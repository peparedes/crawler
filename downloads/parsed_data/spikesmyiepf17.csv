So I'm back here on my old account (hurray)...Justin is going to be here in a few hours hopefully...I just got off the phone with him and he said he was coming...but he can't stay too long because my parents are being dumb and they've decided to change their rules <i>yet again.</i>

And my mom got mad because I don't want to go to church tomorrow. Last time I checked my parents weren't making me go, I was going because I wanted to. I can take a day to relax if I want. Besides, there's no one to see afterwards, I'd be spending the three hours after church by myself being bored. And I can do that at home, where I have a DVD player and computer and bed.

I really want to write a poem or something, but nothing is really working for me right now. I haven't written anything since that poem I emailed to Kienan in September. I'm really rusty.

I don't work until Tuesday! Yay schedule:

thurs 8-3
fri 8-4
sat 11-7

"event","So today I pretty much quit therapy, because the woman doesn't even listen when I talk. I was telling her how I could have said certain things to Andy that would have gotten us into a petty argument, but I kept my mouth shut because I'd rather be pleasant, and no matter what I've never liked doing anything to upset him. Then she said, ""Do you feel the same way with your father?"" And I was like, ""well I wasn't done talking about Andy..."" and she just kept talking about my dad. When I told her I wanted to talk about different relationships and not just my father, she said that I wasn't addressing issues and I was being weak and hiding from my problems and creating 'more depression' which just pissed me off. So I decided I'm not going to talk to someone who won't listen to me. We discussed my father for three months. I'm sorry if I want to talk about my ex-boyfriend for a day.

*sigh* I've been feeling worse going to therapy then I have when I'm outside of the place. Not because it's where I have to face my demons, but because she creates them for me.

Ken won Jeopardy again, and I knew the Final Jeopardy question so I felt really smart :D Yay for knowing stuff about Bill Clinton :D

My mother found out about...that boy. And she slapped me upside the head and called me a whorebag. HAHA. I love my mommy.

The Ashlee Simpson CD was sold out. Damn it all."

It's crazy. he's not allowed to be older, he has to be an 80s high school nerd for the rest of his life because it's just too much for me to take. Oh I miss the Breakfast Club days...*sigh*"

"event","Sometimes I wish that I never wrote any of this stuff down, or I have the urge to delete this entire journal, just because looking back on things hurts and at times like these I can't resist the temptation to see what was ""one year ago today"" or whatnot. And I'm feeling really shitty right now looking back on last summer. Mostly because I want to feel now the way that I felt then. Guess I'll have to wait another month or so before I can potentially find it?

That was not an insult to anyone. I just...haven't found someone who can do that yet."

"event","I just wanted you to know that I still consider the happiest times of my life to be the ones when I was with you.

And this doesn't mean that I have feelings for you again, because I know that I don't. I have feelings for our memories, which I know can never be repeated, nor do I want them to be. This just means that I haven't forgotten all that you've done for me, and I haven't forgotten that you're still a good person no matter what has happened between us or how crazy we get sometimes.

And I know that saying it online is cheap and sometimes emotionless, but I had to get it out right now and well...you're not here. Heh."

"event","...and i just vomited five minutes ago.

so today i worked, then walked home and ran into heather E, holly, and jen, and we hung out for a while by sno top, then i went home to shower...then john and i hung out. yay. we visited andy and made plans to see fahrenheit 9/11 but things didn't work out...

frisbee golf was played, but i didnt take it seriously because i really didnt want to be there lol...i'll still prolly go tomorrow anyway because i like friends.

then i went to adams around 9, and joey came over and we tried to convince adam to dump his girlfriend by comparing the two of them to amanda peet and jason biggs in 'saving silverman' but it didn't work. then i licked his neck. hahahaha.

then it was off to andy's, since we had a misunderstanding about who was meeting whom where and therefore missed the movie..we watched south park and ate ice cream. hence subject and vomit. i had lots of fun. :D

highlights of the evening:
- adam's 8-year-old sister asking if he was ""two-timing"" his girlfriend
- me sticking my wet index finger into ryan's ear simply because sans told me to over the phone
- being able to walk into andy's house without him knowing, walking upstairs and just chilling while he stands there in a towl without feeling weird. i'm glad that we are where we're at...i'm so comfortable with him lately...in the friend way...it's weird because i've always been taught that exes have to hate each other...and i'm glad that we don't

tattoo next week. unrelated, but fun :)"

"event","So I managed to wake up in time for work at six even though I thought I wouldn't be able to...and I worked with Jack for an hour, then Mario and Rachel showed up. Then TED arrived. *sigh* I was so mad when I found out I would be working with him today. We had 8-minute drivethru times and I still don't even care. Plus, I have to tell Kevin or Tracy about inventory tomorrow, since he decided to throw away all of our breakfast food without counting any of it. Apparently I'm ""too slow"" when I'm the only person in the kitchen, I'm running out of product, and he's sitting on his ass in the office ignoring the fact that I have seven or eight orders to make, all under three minutes, if we want to be ""highly proficient."" OH! And guess what? Apparently I can't have my new nametag because Kevin has to give it to me. That's not a big deal, I really don't care, but the fact that Ted was like ""well he probably wants to give it to you himself...you have a special relationship"" really bothered me. And he can't stand more than two feet away from me at any given time. I swear I'm going to ... ARGH. He must die. And someday he will, so I win.

After work I hung out with Kostika and company for a while since he was on break...that was very fun. It's amazing how you don't really talk to some people and you're really shy but then all of a sudden out of nowhere you're talking up a storm and having a good time. I now love the zoo and chickens ;)

*dances* So today really sucked."

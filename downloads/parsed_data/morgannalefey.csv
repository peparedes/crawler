"event","My parents weren't profoundly strict, or particularly full of all sorts of etiquette rules.  They were, in fact, pretty lax in that department.  We never wrote thank you cards, for example.  It was simply not something we were ever taught to do.

But one thing I did learn, and I am surprised at how deeply I have this ingrained in me, is that there are -some- situations where family is important and you don't just blow off family during important milestones in life unless you have a -really- amazingly good reason for it.  So over the years, I've come to recognize this basic attitude in myself.  I keep being flabbergasted when confronted with examples of the families of friends, or my husband, or my own brother, who behave in ways that I thought would have been utterly unconscionable in my family.

Our best friend is getting married to a lovely woman from out of the US.  He's a great guy, a great friend.  Always there for us, willing to help out, run errands, play games, etc.  His fiancee is sweet, funny, intelligent and also generous and willing to help out.

Apparently, though, his kids don't believe it.  They've completely cut him off.  His daughter didn't call to tell him when his own grandchild was born.  His son doesn't respond to outreach, either.  My friend finally just stopped trying.  Oh, our friend was good enough to speak with them back when his daughter was getting married and she wanted money for her big fancy wedding...

But now he's getting married, and there are certain things you just DO when people get married.  I'm hosting a bridal shower for his fiancee, and my husband is hosting a bachelor party.  Both are being held here, so local friends can attend, though the wedding will be taking place in the United Kingdom with her family all 'round (we're going to that, as well).

I wanted to invite the son's girlfriend and the daughter to the bridal shower as a chance for them to meet the bride in a non-threatening situation (loads of family and family friends they know would be there, they'd know more people there than the bride).  I also thought the son should be invited to the bachelor party.

I can't track down phone numbers, or emails, or addresses for any of them.  All the information I have seems to be disconnected or out of date.  I managed to find the girlfriend in Facebook, I'd met her at a jewelry party held by her boyfriend's aunt.  I reminded her who I was and asked her to friend me so I could send an invite to her.  She friended me.  I invited her to the event via Facebook, and poof, she's unfriended me.  Not even the courtesy of any sort of comment to me.

I've sent a message to the son, asking him to please do me the courtesy of responding.  This not saying a word to me, and just disappearing might seem very clear.  I suppose to others it is, but there's a part of me who just can't believe they're really -being- like this.  I mean, what the FUCK?!  I keep thinking there's got to be some sort of misunderstanding.  I want them to just state things clearly to me.  This all feels like a load of shitty game playing.

Ok, I could totally see their actions if my friend had been an abusive father.  I don't know, maybe he was.  But he wasn't so abusive that his daughter didn't ask him for money and didn't invite him to her wedding (though at the last minute she DID decide she didn't want him walking her down the aisle).  I've only known him for the last, oh, four or five years or so.  He's -great-.  Whatever he might once have been, he's not whatever guy it was that so completely ruined their lives that they can't even do him the most basic courtesies DUE to him as their FATHER.

I have a really hard time with understanding how they can be like this.  What sort of people must they be that they can be such total fucking shits when their father finally has found love again after being alone for so long?  Or, alternatively, what sort of monster is our friend that I'm totally unable to see anything even remotely monster-like in him?

ETA: Ok, now that I've settled down a bit and gotten my personal nose a little less out of joint, I have to be fair to a certain extent.  It's entirely possible that my friend has burned through whatever chances they'd given him in some way or other.  I don't know the whole story (and it's not really my business anyway).  So I'm sure in -their- minds, they're acting in their own best interest and protecting themselves."

"event","Our beloved Brynna kitty died at 18.5 years old.  She had failing kidneys and heart problems.  She passed away at the vet's office.  They took her in the back to get blood and urine for testing, and she arrested. They did all they could for her but she was just.. gone.  Just like that.  It hurt, and felt weird.  For the first time in my entire life I didn't have a pet -anywhere-.  Even when I was living on my own for a few years, my parents always had a pet that had belonged to me, too.

I started the process for adopting a dog the day she died.  Well, started researching it, then putting in applications to rescue organizations.  We'd decided when Brynna's health had started to decline that we were going to get a dog after she died, and I needed to be doing something that was looking -forward-.

On May 30th we got Socks.  She is a black lab/Australian shepherd mix.  She used to live in Mississippi and her previous owner had been an elderly woman who had to give her up because she moved into assisted living or something like that, and couldn't keep her.  She's eleven months old, and very beautiful.  I love her to bits.  She's affectionate and friendly, and clever.

Of course we made loads of first time ""puppy"" owner mistakes, but we're learning.  We're taking obedience training and that's paying off.  It's harder having her around, and I'm always having to think ahead about her situation, but it's worth it.  She brings much laughter to our lives.

It's been a very stressful time for Frank because of a MAJOR work project, so it wasn't, perhaps, exactly the best time to bring in a new family member, but we're all doing well enough.  I made liver treats for her yesterday, and she loves them. I enjoyed making them, as well.

We're taking her to Maine in August, and I'm looking forward to her getting to romp in the ocean. She -loves- the water. :)

I hope people are surviving with this recession. *hugs to everyone out there still*"

"event","I have a fondness for Charles Dickens' stories.  I really enjoy tales of comeuppance.  Thing is, I can't stand -reading- Dickens.   Ok, to be fair, I haven't tried for many years, so maybe that's changed, but in the past I've never been able to stand reading his stuff.  But I still love the stories! Make sense? :)

Masterpiece classic just ran a new Oliver Twist that I really liked.  Way better than the musical ""Oliver"" (which I usually find well... meh).  It has elements to the story that I didn't realize were there because I'm most familiar with ""Oliver"".

I didn't realize Fagin was a Jew, for one thing.  His obdurate refusal to become Christian to save his own life did much to redeem him in my eyes.  That whole court scene is completely missing from ""Oliver"", of course, which gives a ""happy"" ending of sorts for Fagin and Dodger.  What I can't decide is if Dickens was trying to elevate Fagin with that refusal, showing that Fagin did, at least, have -some- principles and strength of character, or if he was trying to show Jews as obstinate, stubborn fools who would rather die than save themselves.

I was much more satisfied with Dodger's ending than ""Oliver"" ever gave me.  His becoming, effectively, Bill Sikes seemed very real to me, and it struck me that Dickens probably knew people who had such reactions to privations and abuses.  It's common enough.

Nancy's brokenness was painful to see, but much more realistic, as well.  I don't know how much of this was in the original Dickens or was the actress and director bringing modern understandings of abuse relationships and poverty into the delivery of it.  One can't help but think Dickens must have known women like her, as well.  I think in this telling of the tale, they managed to portray Nancy poignantly.  She touches the heart, but you still see her flaws plainly.

I recommend this retelling. It was good. :)"

"event","I started learning how to knit back in August.  I'm enjoying it a lot, and I've learned a fair amount.  I'm not great, and I'm not fast.  I make a lot of mistakes, but that's ok.  I see so many beautiful things I'd really love to knit, but I'm still struggling with some basic techniques. Hopefully soon I'll be able to figure out knitting in the round with double point needles. :)

I've decided that I need a warm winter hat to wear under the scarf my mother knitted for me some 23 or so years ago.  And I want to knit a new hat and scarf that match for Frank.  But to do the hats, I need to learn to knit in the round. :)  I also need stitch markers, and to learn how to use them. ;D

Lately I've been doing small projects, like knitting a mattress/pillow with matching blanket, and a sweater and tiny conical hat for my robot <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v252/morgannalefey/Knitting/100_0440.jpg"">guinea pig</a>.  She's very cute. :)"

"event","I've wandered through my most recent posts and I realized I hadn't posted about my father dying last year.  *sigh*

This holiday season was hard on me.  It was the first season without either of my parents around (my mother died in Jan, 2002).  I went through a really serious bout of missing Daddy starting in November.  It got so bad I was actually poking at Frank's family (who have basically disowned us because Frank, apparently, thinks he's better than them and hates them because he moved away from Long Island in 1988).

Daddy died on March 4, 2008.  He died about fifteen minutes after I'd cast my primary vote for Obama.  I like to think he hung on just long enough to sense that I'd voted how he wanted me to, though I know he was unconscious at the end.  Even now this is hard to post about and tears threaten.

In November I started dwelling again on all the painful parts of all this.  Daddy never getting another home-cooked meal, and being disappointed when my sister-in-law had promised him she'd bring him a plate of ham dinner from her house on Christmas day, then she never showed up, and never called, never apologized.  I get bitter about the circumstances that led to his death, his getting sent back to his apartment before the hospital bed had arrived, which directly contributed to the fall that eventually killed him (because of the damage to his brain when he hit his head).  

I'm angry at my brother for not going to see Daddy while he was still conscious and able to respond to him, and that he instead waited until Daddy was having constant seizures to show up.  I -believe- that Dad was aware Shaun was there, there were some indications that he understood.  

I still beat myself up that I didn't fly down there and spend his last weeks at his bedside, holding his hand and soothing him.  That he died alone in a hospice room with no one to talk quietly to him while he passed.  But at the same time, we were having to fly for surgery to North Carolina, and Dad didn't want us to not do that.  Dad's health situation was too vague for too long for us to ever be sure if it was the right time to fly down there, and we couldn't afford a lot of time off for both seeing him and getting the surgery.  We had time limits for when we had to get the surgery accomplished... intellectually I know these are all valid reasons for not going, and that Daddy never blamed me for not being there.  But still my heart aches that I never got to hug him again.

It all makes me really wish that I was certain of there being an afterlife, and that Daddy was with Mom, and looking down, and just being happy that the weight of their ill health was gone, and they could be together.  I just remain unconvinced of that, though.

All of this preyed on me, and made me seek out information about Frank's Nana.  I just wanted to -know- once and for all, if she was still alive, and if not, when she passed away.  I just didn't want to believe that Frank's mother wouldn't actually get in contact with him to tell him the woman who helped raise him, who loved him so much, had died.  She got in contact with Frank when his brother in law died.  This was a man that Frank had spent a total of 12 hours of his life in the presence of (and 5 of those hours were at the -wedding-, none of this was ""quality"" time that entailed any real relationship).  Yet his mother emailed him when Gene died, like that was some news.  But she couldn't tell him when Nana died.  

I managed to contact Frank's paternal grandmother, who confirmed that Nana passed away in the nursing home a couple of years ago, but not exactly when, and she had no idea where Nana was buried.  I got very close to trying to call Frank's mother and/or sister, but Frank managed to head me off, because that's a can of worms I really don't want to open.

Which of course leads to this nasty little part inside of me that wishes it was Frank's mother who had died, not my father.  Because MY parents would NEVER have EVER done anything as vile as refuse to tell one of their children that a grandmother had died.  It wouldn't matter how estranged we'd become (though my parents wouldn't ever have become estranged like that, either), they would ALWAYS have told us.

So I just drift on missing my family, and not really having anything I can do about it.  I love Frank so much, and he's home to me, always has been and of course he's ""family"".  Still, I miss family holidays, and visiting and such.  I miss the extended family.

I try to stem those feelings by taking on my closest friends as family, but that can only work so well.  Especially when there are scheduling problems with the holidays. :)

This year was lovely in so many ways.  I had a good time, it was peaceful and calm and restorative. That was all good.  Still...  I feel a little petulant.  I miss my Mom and Dad and wish they were around to talk to.

Enough of this.  Frank's gone to bed, and I feel silly sitting here crying about this.  I just wanted to get his information out there for folks who might not realize my father had died.

I've set up a memorial site for him, because he had a significant online presence and a lot of online friends.  They're moving to a new server, so it'll be down for about two weeks starting on Sunday, but it'll be back again on the 18th.  You can see it here: http://normanstevenson.last-memories.com/  if you want."

I've been toying with the idea of doing a dream journal for a few weeks, just to see what comes of it.  Found a weird little site full of new age woowoo stuff about medication, but it's kinda cute, too and I'm finding myself liking cute these days.

I got a robot guinea pig for christmas (among other VERY cute things) and I've been knitting little things for her.  Not very well, but it's still fun 'cos the stuff gets completed fairly quickly. :)

Ramble ramble.

"event","On a sociological level, food is not merely sustenance for humans. 

Most of our religious rituals revolve around food, either by the presence of special foods (like the Jewish Seder or Christian Communion), or the abstinance from food for a period of time (Lent or various traditions of fasting in eastern faiths).  In many cultures, the dead are buried with items of food that they'll bring them them into the next life, and offerings of food are made to the gods (yes, even Yhwh, read the old testament).  The spiritual symbology of food runs deep in the human psyche.

Our family/social connections tend to center around food rituals of all sorts: Family dinner, Pizza night, Easter Dinner, Thankgiving, Feast of the Dead, Harvest festivals, canning parties, pot latches, afternoon tea, pot lucks in the church basement, food drives, food shelters, ""going out for coffee"", ""let's do lunch""... the examples are endless.  Every human culture has myriad examples that show food is deeply ingrained, not just in our biology, but in our culture, all throughout our society.

These rituals we engage in are profound.  They touch us more deeply than we tend to be conscious of.

When we lose track of these rituals, for instance the gradual decline of the ""family dinner"", it diminishes us individually.  We're losing something that helps us connect with our families or our friends.  When most of your meals are something bolted down while you're driving alone in your car, or even at home, standing in front of the fridge and eating whatever comes to hand, you're losing some of the experience of being human.

Of course there isn't always time in our modern world to make every meal something special, but recognizing the social and personal importance of sitting down to meals, and engaging in the process of taking in sustenance helps us find ways to make time.  It improves our relationships, our ability to connect to the people in our lives, our need for relating to people outside ourselves.  Even sitting in a restaurant alone but surrounded by other people is touching the edges of the social meal experience and is more grounding than gulping down a big mac in the car.

It's wrong to feel guilty about food, or enjoying food.  When you're fat, you're always hearing about ""your relationship to food"", and it's always couched in terms of guilt.  In Western society in general, and in American society in particular, there is a deep psychosis about food, and eating, and enjoying food.

Denying ourselves pleasure in our meals is denying a fundamental part of being human.  When we actually feel guilt for such a truly human experience as enjoying food, we are caught in an inevitably destructive mindset that pits us against our own humanity and biology.  We have millions of years of evolution that drives us to eat, and not only to eat, but to take pleasure in eating because we respond positively to pleasurable stimuli.  Sex is pleasurable -because- it encourages us to reproduce.  If people didn't enjoy sex, they wouldn't bother.

Likewise, eating is pleasurable.  We don't just eat because we're hungry, we're more complex then that. Taking pleasure in our food, concocting new recipes, discovering new things to eat, all of that is enmeshed in being human, in being social, and in being mentally healthy.  Setting yourself up against these profound truths about being human is as impossible/potentially harmful as trying not to breathe.

My next post is going to be about applying these thoughts in a practical way as I consider getting the mini gastric bypass."

"event","My husband and I are in the very beginning stages of considering the option of mini gastric bypass as a way to reverse our diabetes.  I'm trying to get my head around this stuff, so I'm posting some of my initial thoughts here. I'll likely be editing and adding to them over time as I find out more.

MGB Pros
<ul>
<li>Reversal of diabetes</li>
<li>Avoidance of further diabetes complications (like high blood pressure, certain eye problems, etc.)</li>
<li>Be more active and outdoorsy (camping, hiking, walking the land, biking near our house, etc.) </li>
<li>Less wear and tear on the furniture</li>
<li>Be able to sleep in smaller beds in hotels with Frank</li>
<li>Fit comfortably in airplane seats</li>
<li>Less expensive clothes I can actually try on before buying</li>
<li>More energy overall</li>
<li>Fewer aches and pains</li>
<li>Perhaps a reduction in some mood swings brought about by pain/aches</li>
<li>Sex would probably be better, more flexibility, more variety of positions</li>
<li>More stamina overall</li>
<li>Feeling better about the foods I'm eating instead of feeling like I'm cheating myself in one way in order to satisfy myself in another</li>
</ul>
MGB Cons
<ul>
<li>Insurance may not pay for it/have to fight with insurance to get it/might have to pay for it myself (that's a show stopper, I think)</li>
<li>I've always thought of WLS as ""mutilation"" for the sake of fashion (Was it mutilation to get my gall bladder out? Is this really mutilation if it reverses my diabetes?)</li>
<li>What if a better, less invasive diabetes treatment that works comes along? (is it truly reversible even ten years later?)</li>
<li>My breasts will get smaller, but would they get unpleasantly smaller? Would I start looking out of proportion?</li>
<li>Not being able to tolerate foods that I really enjoy a lot</li>
</ul>

MGB Questions
<ul>
<li>Are there people with Type II who still have it after the procedure?</li>
<li>What percentage of people who have MGB becomes lactose intolerant?</li>
<li>What about that acid pooling thing mentioned by Holly's nurse friend?</li>
<li>What are the long-term health impacts of MGB?</li>
<li>Why would MGB be better than RNY in the long term? Have any studies been done about this?</li>
<li>Is it truly reversible even ten years later?</li>
</ul>"

"event","I wrote this a while ago for another forum and thought I'd put it up here just because I was revisiting the thoughts in it.

Someone at the other forum had said: I might be able to change, but then I wouldn't be me any more.

Which prompted the following:

I've been pondering it since last night.  It calls for an examination of the concept of who we ""really"" are.

In the end, change is inevitable.  Even people who seem rooted in who they are, and who seem never to change, have actually changed over time.  They are not the same person they were when they were 10, 18, or 21.  And not just physically.  Those stop maturing emotionally at a young age, still have changes afterwards.  Unless there is something pathologically wrong with us, it is impossible for us to avoid changes in our emotions and thought processes that are related to our environments.

I should note here that I'm not talking about any sort of extreme pathology that might prevent such natural occurances (like comas, or extreme mental disturbances).  I'm talking about a typical human life full of all its challenges and rewards.

It then follows that ""Me"" changes.  ""Me"" is a continuum, not a snapshot.  ""Me"" is not, and cannot be, static.  It's not any one state that we are, or any one set of beliefs that remains the same over time.  The ""Me"" that fails to change over time dies off fairly quickly because it cannot adapt to the continuous change that surrounds us.

This is so much a part of who we are that we don't even really examine closely.  Sometimes we look at little bits of ourselves that we've clung to over time, parts that seem immutable. But they aren't the whole of who we are, they don't define us completely.

Like, for me it's my control freakness.  As much as I would like to change that part of me, and as many problems as it causes me, I have the idea in my head that I will always be a control freak.  But what if I was wrong?  What if it was something I could, eventually, change about myself?  Does that change ""Me""?  Would I no longer be Siobhan simply because I'd overcome a self destructive personality trait?

I don't buy it.  I'd be a new and improved Siobhan, but still Siobhan. That's because Siobhan-ness isn't tied to a particular state of being. Siobhan-ness is a journey, and journeys are change.  I've certainly changed a lot over the years.  I've learned a lot.  I've matured.  I am very different from what I was at 7, 18, and 27.  I've worked on personality traits that have been detrimental, and succeeded in overcoming them.

Trying to hold onto what we were in the past is not only impossible, it's self-defeating.  Trying to be who you were at 18 or 28 means avoiding who you are today.  Trying to hold onto traits that are self destructive because you want to avoid changing the essential ""Me"" is a massive rationalization for avoiding the work necessary to change. It's an attractive idea and it sounds slick on the surface, but beneath the surface it's really just an argument you'd expect from a child who doesn't want to grow up.

It is rational to want to improve one's situation and to increase one's chances at, if not happiness, then at least contentment.  It is typical that we don't always know how to do that.  It is common that people, rather than making a concerted effort at self examination to identify the behaviours that defeat them, flail about trying different versions of the same behaviours that got them into trouble/unhappiness last time.

Of course, that all being said, I have a tendancy to believe that there are individual traits we all have that are just too deeply wired into our brains for us to have the time, energy, and tools to truly change.  We do have to pick our ""battles"" and decide if the end product is going to be worth all the pain, effort, and electroshock it takes to effect real change in certain behaviour patterns.

Which leads into the idea of acceptance and that is a long post for another time. :)"

"event","My brother called last night asked me to take Dad for six months to give him a break.

My father has had a couple of strokes and is disabled. His cognitive abilities have been trashed and he's got some paralysis. He's crochety, unhappy with his lot in life, hates feeling like a burden, feels trapped in his body, and is frustrated by his limitations.  His health is iffy at best.

My house is ten miles outside town. The closest VA hospital (where he is able to get health care) is two hours away. I work fifty minutes away from the house, my husband is thirty minutes away (and we only  have the one car, which I take to my office after dropping my husband off). We live in a cold climate, so Dad would be cold *all* the *time*. We don't have high speed internet (well, we have satellite, but it's dodgy sometimes) so Dad would have more limited contact with his online communities. He'd be alone all day long (my brother has an office at home so he's there most of the time). And Dad's feeling of being a burden would just increase, rather than decrease, by staying with me.

In all ways our house is *the worst* possible choice for Dad's situation. My brother has, of course, fixated on it as ""the solution"" when it's not any sort of solution.

I think the real solution that would help everyone would be for them to get some family therapy to work out the communication problems they're having, to help Dad settle better in Shaun's home (he was moved a while ago out of the house my Mother had bought for him because Shaun couldn't keep up with both that house and his house), to help him modify his behaviour and make him less of a burden on my brother, to help my brother learn new ways of dealing with my dad and to stop thinking dad's behaviour is just maliciousness or laziness, to recognize that Dad's anger isn't just coming from out of the blue... for all of them to learn better ways of dealing with each other.

But of course my brother refuses.  He won't take the time, refuses to accept it might help, and thinks just ""sharing the burden"" by having me take Dad will fix everything. ""Just give me a break for six months and I'm sure I'll be good for another four years.""

So I'm trying to work out some options that will give him the respite he needs, get dad the therapy *he* needs (even if Shaun won't do it), and just put Dad in a better situation.

I wish I'd talked to Mom about this more in depth before she died.... *sigh*"

Hall of Ritual

   Tall columns support the high, rounded ceiling of this light and airy room.  A fresh breeze flows through open windows which admit air and sunlight when weather permits.  Crafted of off-white marble, this place of high rituals has very few decorations; only a wheat motiff on the lengths of the columns.  A raised platform with a podium stands at the end of the hall.  A basin filled with water stands in front of the podium.    Two small booths for private ceremonies and confessions are to the east and west, wicker screens assuring privacy.  The entrance hall is to the south.

The corpse of Edamar is lying here on a raised platform, being prepared for burial.   
A young man in green robes tends to his daily chores.
A young woman wearing yellow robes sees to some chores about the church.
A matronly woman stands here, smiling kindly to all who pass.

Aelwyd swallows a sob and moves over to the corpse of Edamar. 

Aelwyd dips a clean rag in a blue ceramic bowl containing water then wrings out some of the water and leans close to the corpse of Edamar. She gently starts washing his face, murmuring, 'Your face wants washing. You always were so messy.'

You say in Harnic, continuing dipping a clean rag into a blue ceramic bowl containing water, then washing very tenderly, cleaning off the dirt and blood,
   ""This is th' bowl an' the cloth I used first time I washed your face, remember? It's water from th' barrel you brought me, all filled with water from th' fountain here at th' temple. You always thought that water tasted best, you said.""

Isidora is entering from the south.

You say in Harnic, speaking gently to the corpse of Edamar,
   ""You shoulda listened when Peoni was tellin' you not t' go up there.""

Aelwyd keeps washing the corpse of Edamar with a clean rag, dipping it into a blue ceramic bowl containing water to rinse it out once in a while. 

You say in Harnic, gazing at the corpse of Edamar with loving eyes, strangely devoid of tears,
   ""Remember when we was sayin' how many kids we'd want? An' you said... you said you wanted three. I said that sounded good... I was lyin'. I wanted t' keep havin' your babies until I couldn't any more. Dozens of 'em if that's what we had.""

You say in Harnic, speaking softly to the corpse of Edamar,
   ""I figured six was a good number t' have. Lots of hands t' make light work, but maybe three would have been enough.""

You say in Harnic, speaking to the corpse of Edamar,
   ""I'd give anything for jus' one now.""

Isidora lingers near a tall column, standing silently as she looks towards the body. 

You say in Harnic, dipping a clean rag again to rinse it and working down the corpse of Edamar's arms,
   ""I remember when you picked me up th' first time, how surprised I was at how strong you were. You didn't quite look like it.""

You say in Harnic, speaking to *corpse,
   ""I bought that rosewater hopin' it'd catch you an' you'd look at me.""

You say in Harnic, speaking to the corpse of Edamar,
   ""I never told you that.""

Reb is entering from the south, walking with a mournful reluctance.
Merewyn is entering from the south.

Aelwyd finishes washing the corpse of Edamar and just gazes down at him thoughtfully. 

You say in Harnic, speaking to the corpse of Edamar,
   ""I guess you was Scanna's all along, anyways. Maybe she really needed you.""

Reb holds Merewyn's hand gently in his. 

Reb sniffles and sheds a few tears at your words. 

Reb walks over to you slowly, not letting go of Merewyn's hand, and hangs back a little, trying not to intrude. 

Reb gets a wagon-wheel-shaped silver pin from a pale green pouch of fine linen.

   ""Nate got this to give to you.""

You tell Reb in Harnic, looking up at him with dry eyes,
   ""That's real kind of him, but he left me things in th' cottage, maybe that should be buried with him. It meant so much to him.""

You say in Harnic, looking back at the corpse of Edamar,
   ""He's lookin' real peaceful now. Maybe he saw Scanna ... or...""

Reb tells you in Harnic, nodding, his face stoic despite his tears,

Reb gives you a wagon-wheel-shaped silver pin. 

Reb tells you in Harnic,

Aelwyd clutches the pin, staring at it and turning it over in her hand. 

You tell Reb in Harnic, nodding and sighing,
   ""He was too good for this place, I guess.""

Merewyn lowers her head and remains silent as she gazes downwards. 

You tell Reb in Harnic, her voice rough with anguish,
   ""When I went back to th' cottage I noticed he'd left some things there that weren't b'fore. I think... he was intendin'...""

Reb tells you in Harnic, 
   ""Don't mean he was intendin' nothin'.""

Reb tells you in Harnic, 
   ""Might just be the Gentle Lady guided his hand to see to what's needed for you.""

You tell Reb in Harnic, looking slightly hopeful,
   ""Maybe... he was jus' movin' in ... in his mind.""

   ""I hate t' think he went lookin' for ... this.""

Reb tells you in Harnic, 
   ""She knew you'd be needin' now and she'd be able to see to all his needs in the Meadows, so she'd guide his hand to see to them needs as have to be met here.""

You tell Reb in Harnic, looking more at ease,
   ""Aye.. aye that must be it. She's always lookin' out for us, even when we need t' go.""

Reb tells you in Harnic, apologetically, 
   ""Nate said as the keys he had were gone, so you'll need to see to gettin' all the locks changed. I told Master Jere for to be expectin' you so's he could be prepared.""

Isidora slips out of the ritual hall, turning from the body. 
Isidora begins walking southward.

Reb tells you in Harnic, brushing feebly at his 
eyes, 
   ""Well, if'n you need any help with any of it, you got friends what'll help.""

A very short, green-cloaked person is entering from the south, her red skirts rustling softly.

You tell Reb in Harnic, her voice rough with anguish,
   ""Aye, I've th' best friends anyone could be askin' for.""

Melisanna lowers a long, flowing cloak of green russet's hood, revealing her features. 

Reb nods to a chocolate-brown-haired, golden-brown-eyed woman. 

You tell Reb in Harnic, her voice rough with anguish,
   ""I'll jus' go t' see Master Jer about them locks. Wouldn't do for his work an' home t' be all .... rifled through.""

Melisanna lowers her hood as she looks at the corpse her expression mournful as she nods at a large, auburn-haired man and looks down before she makes the sign of the sword across her chest. 

Reb asks you in Harnic, 
   ""Anythin' else you're needin'?""

Melisanna makes her way to the dais and kneels down making the sign of the sword across her chest her eyes downcast. 

Melisanna begins quietly worshipping.

Reb tells you in Harnic, 
   ""I told Master Elliot as you might not be a couple days. I'll tell Phaedra if'n I see 'er, so's she can try to keep things up so you don't got to worry about the Lion.""

Melisanna concludes her worship.

Melisanna begins quietly worshipping.

Melisanna concludes her worship.

You tell Reb in Harnic, smiling gratefully at him,
   ""Aye, thank you. Might need t' take some time at that. There's a lot t' be doin'.""

"event","I play on this mud that is roleplay intensive, and where death is permanent.  My husband wrote a really great <a href=""http://hawthornthistleberry.blogspot.com/2006/04/harshlands.html#links"">review</a> and explanation for why Harshlands is such a fantastic place to roleplay, no point in my trying to recreate that here. But do go read it, it's very well thought out.

My character has had a difficult life (well who would want to play someone who was a serf,  planted crops, didn't do anything, then died of old age? ok, maybe me now...).

She was raised in a farm village, daughter of a Yeoman who stepped out on his wife, but still got her with eight children (two of whom died as infants).  Aelwyd was third of six surviving children, and the sister to two fantastically beautiful females, so always was referred to as the ""plain one"". She's not really ugly, and maybe a bit more than just plain, but she always thought of herself that way.

Early on she fell in love (or so she thought, she knows better now) with a glutton who had a miser for a father and was using her to get more/better food than he could get at home.  Maybe he thought he loved her, too.  She married at age sixteen, and as soon as the food portion of her dowry was exhausted and she was stuck trying to develop new and creative ways for serving turnips, he became like is father and beat her regularly.  He was also fairly lustful, and would take her pretty much wherever he felt like, without any regard for what she might be doing at the time.

She didn't really have anywhere to go, and the people in her village were no help at all. So she just resolved to escape as soon as the opportunity presented itself.  But the first order of business was not to have any children.  Fortunately in Harn (where Harshlands is set) they have contraceptive teas. So she managed to avoid getting pregnant for the two years they were married.  Her mother in law always claimed she was cursed, since she never got pregnant, despite her son planting his seeds regularly...

When Aelwyd was eighteen, her husband died from eating too much mutton stew that had just turned.  The rest of the family got ill, but he died because he ate so much.  She was free of him, and had discovered her father in law's secret hoard of coins some time ago.  She helped herself to what she thought fair wages for the two years she'd slaved on his farm, and ran to the nearest big city that was far enough away to keep anyone from coming after her.

When she got there, she got a job right away as a cook and eventually became an apprentice innkeeper.  She was pretty ripe for the picking and ""fell in love"" with someone unsuitable for her, because he was *so* different and offered such a different life.  He ran off across the sea for two years and she spent about a year and a half feeling pretty numb when she found out he wasn't really who she thought he was at all.

She finally opened up again, and fell, again, for the wrong man. This time a monk who had sworn a vow of chastity, and who, if had been released from his vow, would still be married.  Though he loved her back, they could never marry or raise a family, so they decided she needed to marry a good man, and he'd help her find one.

Edamar had been engaged to her first, and closest, friend when she got to Tashal. She'd always felt a soft spot for him.  Her friend died to some wolves and Edamar had grieved a great deal for her. They'd been very much in love.  In time, however, it started to fade, and Aelwyd's quiet devotion crept into his heart.  Eventually, he came to realize he loved her, and sought her love.

Aelwyd had never thought of Edamar in that light, but in him she saw the solution to some of her problems.  She made up her mind to love him, rather more than actually loving him at first.  Eventually she settled into the new relationship glow, and it felt better than her other relationships, so she decided she was doing the right thing and that deep love would grow.  She never told Edamar this, but she didn't love him as much as he loved her. She was certain she would, in time, love him more than he loved her.

She hadn't stopped loving the monk, either, and was working her way through dealing with the fact that it was possible to actually love two men.

Then tragedy struck.  Edamar, either fleeing from wolves, or intent on avenging the death of his family before he married Aelwyd, got killed by gargun (orcs).

The reasons for this are pretty simple, the player of Edamar's wife didn't want him to marry anyone in game (do NOT get me started on what I think about THAT), and he hadn't checked with her on that point before he'd gotten involved with Aelwyd.  Given the circumstances, we decided Edamar's death would be best all around in the long run, and create some powerful dramatic scenes to play out.  This happened last night...

What I hadn't counted on was how I, the player, would feel.

I've been playing muds for over ten years now, but never a mud where death was permanent. I woke up this morning and thought, ""Edamar is dead"".  I actually cried in the shower a little bit when I remembered the pitcher of milk that Edamar had bought for Aelwyd one morning after she'd fallen asleep on the couch in his house and he'd watched over her all night.  There are dozens of examples of memories Aelwyd built with Edamar in the short time they courted that bring tears to my eyes to think about now.

If I'd been watching this in a movie, I'd have been crying as well.  It was very moving, very dramatic, and I guess I'm going to need to work through the grief as much as Aelwyd will have to.  Fortunately I have a loving husband who also plays, and who also was crying at the temple where Edamar's body was laid out.  So at least he won't think I'm insane.

I'll post the log of Aelwyd saying goodbye to Edamar next."

On another note...

I was thinking about the tendancy for the majority of social liberals to be better educated and a little more intelligent overall than the majority of social conservatives (just talking majorities, obviously there are some very intelligent and educated conservatives)...

I think some part of me always thought ""liberals are for education, so of course they get more education"", but I think that might be wrong (and obviously an oversimplification).  I think what happens is that, once you get some education, it opens your eyes to things, and you think about and realize certain truths about who humans are, and that process leads people to become more liberal in their thinking.  Being open to things outside your own narrow range of experience is an important part of liberalism.

When I find myself arguing with social conservatives (something I usually try to avoid but once in a while I court it, like in a recent thread on rec.food.cooking you could look up if you wanted, the thread is called ""food snob"" or some such), I am often a little surprised at how narrow their experiences are, and that they can't seem to accept or grasp that their experience isn't all there is, that there are people who have very different frames of reference, and more importantly, THIS IS OK.

I try to encourage them to not take my word for things, but to go out and read up on this for themselves. I tell them the information is out there if they'll bother to look even a little bit for it.  Of course they don't.  They don't want to be wrong, they don't want to learn.

This thread is about the poor and how badly many of them eat, which, of course, results in obesity. So many of these people are so completely clueless about what urban poverty is like that they just can't understand the depth of the problem. To them poor people are just lazy people sucking off the government teat without any concern for the rest of the world.  They  hold them in contempt.  Ok, sure, there are some poor people who *could* do something, but choose not to, but most of them don't.  Most of them are trapped, perhaps by choices they, themselves made, but that doesn't make them any less trapped.

These people I'm talking to have zero compassion.  They're so tied up in hating the few people who abuse the system that they'd be completely willing to make it impossible for those who don't abuse it (who are, in fact, the majority of people who use it).

Sometimes I'm so dismayed by the depth of people's ability to hate,,, then I think about Dubya, Rumsfeld, Rove, Cheney, et. al. and I realize that I'm just as human as they are when it comes to the ability to hate.  Somehow it's not particularly comforting."

"event","This story starts long ago, in July of 2004, before I even entered it.

My eye doctor (I'm not going to look up the spelling :P ) decided around July of 2004 that they no longer wished to be included as part of the Cigna medical plan, and only wanted to do vision for them.  They started the process for getting removed from the medical list, but found it to be convoluted and impossible.  Cigna continually lost faxes, letters, and ignored phone calls.  After several months of trying to do this, the office manager gave up trying to get off the list.

A few months later, around mid January, they got a letter from Cigna telling them that they'd been dropped from the medical plan.

Around the end of September, 2004, I got a referral for going to the eye doctor for my annual MEDICAL eye exam.  I'm diabetic and I need to get my eyes checked every year as part of my medical care.  I scheduled with my eye doctor's office like I always have before, and they accepted my appointment because at that time, they were still part of the medical plan.

My appointment was on January 10, 2005.  At this point everyone knew this was supposed to be a medical visit.  I went to my appointment and all was supposed to be fine.  But then the eye doctor got a letter telling them they weren't on the medical plan.  My bill got processed as routine vision care, instead of medical.  Most of the time this wouldn't be a problem, except that it was found during my appointment that my eyeglasses prescription changed.

So I had to, eventually, get new lenses for my glasses.  We got around to buying those in March of 2005, from a local optician who is also part of the Cigna vision plan.

Cigna rejected $70 of the bill for the new lenses because they said had already spent that much on routine vision care for that year (I only get $100 every alternate year for routine vision care, which is why it's so important that my annual eye exams are paid as medical, not vision).  Of course none of this really started coming out until maybe June of 2005 (that's how long processing and corresponding can take).

I started talking to Cigna, my eye doctor's office manager, and the optician's office manager, trying to get this resolved.  My eye doctor's office has resubmitted bills no less than three times, trying to change the coding to the medical codes, instead of the routine codes.  Meanwhile, I keep begging my optician's office to be patient while I work this out (see, if I just paid the $70, there is NO way I'd get reimbursed by Cigna for it, I'm out $70 that Cigna really *should* be paying, I am not asking for one penny that isn't a covered benefit).

This has been going on in bursts since June or July of 2005.  We get told something by Cigna, the eye doctor's office tries that, it takes weeks to process, I tell the optician to give it a go, it all stalls out.  Then I'm back on the phone with Cigna again.

Finally, on January 12th, 2006 they received the first bill that they'd actually say was coded for medical not routine vision care..  They told me it would take fifteen days to process.  I told the optician it should be good to go by February 2nd.

NO ONE was informed that the processing of this new bill was held up because the charges were detailed separately on the eye doctor's bill (office visit $51, refraction $19). They refused it because of a *date conflict* in the computer system. They never directly contacted the eye doctor's office to find out more.  I only found out about this after I got yet another bill from the optician just a few days ago telling me that Cigna had refused to pay them yet again.

So I called Cigna today to find out what the hell was going on.  Apparently they need some sort of explanation from the provider to process the bill like that.  They want to know why the charges were separated.  Who GIVES A DAMN?  It's the same billing amount and date for a bill that they ALREADY APPROVED AND PAID A YEAR AGO.  They absolutely refuse to process it unless they get an explanation from the doctor.  They claim that the explanation is very simple, very easy, and no problem at all.

The office manager tells a very different story and says that it's easier for her to rebill it as a single amount than it is for her to try and explain the bill because they never listen, they lose things, and they ignore her.

But what's going to happen is she'll resubmit, they will finally go to actually process it, and then they'll reject it because that office isn't on the medical provider list, even though no one knew that until AFTER my appointment.

I've decided not to wait for this to happen.  I've called the employees benefits people to see if there's anything they're going to be able to actually do about this to fix the problem.  When she calls to tell me she can't do anything, I'm calling the Health Care Ombudsman's office and hoping that THEY can bring pressure to bear to get this damn mess resolved."

"event","Palmer called, finally.  He was just as emphatic about us being too far to get served from the remote terminal as Nate was that we'd be able to get DSL when I spoke to him on the 22nd.

He said that they have equipment at Cutler Corner, but that we're still too far away from it to be served by it.  That it would take the installation of new equipment and that he knew of no plans to serve that area in the near future.  He said that ultimately they had plans to bring broadband everywhere, but that's in the long term, and he had no idea when anything would be happening near us.

It was almost actually a relief to finally hear something this definitive from someone who knows the lines and the equipment as I know Palmer does (and he did remember me and where I lived without my having to remind him, sometimes I really just love Vermont and old Vermonters).

So I called and set up for the installation of satellite internet on Friday.  We'll be locked into a one year contract, but the dial up problems will melt away, and we'll be able to actually use the internet from our house again.  It's been a long year and four months.

Meanwhile I am trying to figure out suitable punishment on Verizon for wasting three full months of my life on this wild goose chase when I was *never* actually able to get DSL at our house.  If they'd just talked to a local engineer... we'd have had our answer in days."

So I called and spoke to another supervisor (after the same little square dance I have to do to get to a supervisor every stinking time even though the supervisors always tell me to ask for supervisors, the others don't want to hand me over).  I spoke with Dave in Dallas (take THAT Simon) who told me that it looks like everything is complete and our account is active, and that we should be able to turn the modem on when we get home. If it doesn't work we're supposed to call Tech Support for a Supervisor (tm) to get it resolved.

He did say that his line test shows ""no sync"" but that it could be the modem is off.  I don't think that's the case, I'm pretty sure my husband has been leaving it on, but it's possible I suppose.

I put in a very obsequious call to Palmer, the engineer (tm). I left him a gentle message in dulcet tones asking humbly for him to call and let me know what might really be going on.

This constantly changing the story every alternate phone call thing is really driving me nuts.

I called the Wildblue installation guy today, got a quote for satellite internet, and we're ready to go ahead with that if I can't get any satisfaction from Verizon on this DSL thing.

This time there was a little difference, this time there was no unfeeling, automated phone message sent to us to inform us of our status at all.  I'm left to guess at our status.

I have visions of a large room stacked high with piles of paper.  The lights are dodgy and flicker.  There is a narrow path that wends between the towers of documents and I see a small, mousy man in a dirty, tan lab coat carrying our trouble ticket between his fingers like it's a dead rat.  He scurries over to one of the piles way in the back, and deftly (with the skill of long practice) lifts up a pile and slips our trouble ticket to the bottom of it. An evil sneer spreads across his features and he mumbles something about Mother being the only one who truly understands.

In another part of the central office there is a sleek, pristine lab all stainless steel and white tile.  A woman with a perfect white complexion (that you only get by never, ever, ever, stepping outside) and her black hair pulled back into a screechingly tight bun with two bright red chopsticks stabbed through it sits on a high stool next to the counter.  She is wearing a shockingly white, well-pressed lab coat over her sophisticated wool pinstripe suit, and red pumps that match the chopsticks. Her long red nails clack delicately on the shiny keys of a black keyboard.  Her eyes are riveted to the Sudoku game she's playing. The mousy man in the tan lab coat returns, cackling a little like Igor, and she asks, ""Is it done?""  He wheezes out ""Oh yes, Mistress, yes. They will never have DSL.""

The automated answering machine they have always tells me ""I can't find any orders for your number"" then transfers me to a person. It's always a little scary when it says that.  I live in fear that they'll close this account once again, and I'll have yet another two week delay.

Miss Deluca from MA. She showed the order as still pending.  I told her what Nate had said, and she said she couldn't tell me anything more about my status and would ""send [me] over to DSL"".  I got Jill in Texas, I just immediately asked her to send me to a supervisor because my order had been escalated. I explained (again) about how I'd been assured emphatically that I would have DSL last night and a tech would be at my house, and no such thing had happened.  She put me on hold and went looking for a supervisor.

I wish there was some way for me to call the Burlington office more directly. It's very frustrating.

While I'm holding I'm slaying the robot clowns that threaten the safety of the neopets of neopia (neopets.com).  Evil, horrific robot clowns that explode in a puff of gooey whipped cream... there are distant clown snipers who try to fight me off with cream pies, and I often come out at the end of the battle covered with whipped cream, but knowing that I've stopped at least some of the robot clown horde...

I got Kenneth in Texas, after I explained to him the situation, he said that he's looking at the notes and they are saying that the signal is reading ""zeros at the central office"" which means that the signal isn't getting to our modem. He said he'd have to find more information because this might be old information.

Two hours later, I'm still holding.  I've been getting some reading done for work that I've been putting off, so it hasn't been completely unproductive.

Finally Kenneth is back.  He says they did a line test and it came back as our house being too far (and I had a serious case of deja vu).  They have to do some more work to try and fix it because they think that the terminal wasn't being included (or some such). They show us as 35,200 feet from the central office and that's coming back from the field tech. We are assigned to a remote terminal, and the qualifying distance is 18.000 feet.  The engineers need to find out what exactly is happening that might be going wrong at the remote terminal that is causing this problem. A ticket was sent to the local egineers by Laurie at the remote terminal office in Pawtucket, RI while Kenneth had her on the phone, so before noon.  The engineers get the ticket immediately (it's electronic, they all have DSL, and they're keeping it from me) and it goes into their queue. Could be completed today, but more likely Friday by the end of the day.

I asked him where I should call when nothing happens again, and this time I cleverly asked for a ticket number so I could have something specific to point the staff to when I called. Ticket Number 107981416 

Whoever answers will likely need to send me to a supervisor or a tier three person when I call back because they won't be able to help me.

I want to start hanging out at the central office to see who goes in and out of there, and maybe follow them to a local bar where I buy him or her a few drinks to oil the tongue then get information (or DSL) out of them right on the spot.  I hate how removed I am from the people who are actually doing the work.  All it does is make it easy for them to lie to me.

Coincidentally, the 24th was the latest go live date we had when they delayed it from the 15th.  It makes me think that they were intending to be doing this work today and tomorrow all along, and everything else has just been jerking me around. Paranoid? Me? Who told you that?"

My husband had a call at some point in the morning (he'd taken the week off as we have a house guest) informing him that there had been a technician out to the terminal yesterday, but no one could understand the note he'd left about it.  So they were going to send someone else out to look at our NIB that day.

No technician and no word by 2 PM so I called to find out our status. Of course I had to wangle my way around until I had a supervisor (at one point the first person I spoke to, Paula, gave me a minor heart attack by telling me she didn't see any orders for my line).  I finally got Nate on the phone.  Nate told me that there was definitely a dispatch for a technician to come out.  He offered to check, to make sure the tech could make it, and to call me back.  So I agreed.

He called me back in around an hour (he'd been forced to wait on hold for forty five minutes, he said ;D ) and told me that the tech was still supposed to get out there today, and that they couldn't commit to a time and that tech calls happened between 9 AM and 5 PM.  He assured me that it would happen.  I said, ""And after this visit, will I have DSL?""

His response was an emphatic, ""Yes!""

I laughed. I couldn't help it.  He sounded so young, so certain.

I said ""That's a very definite sounding yes, are you sure you don't want to modify it?""

He said ""No, you will have DSL tonight.""

I note here that he'd mentioned earlier that he wasn't going to be working Thursday (the next day) so he wasn't going to deal with me if I called back.  Not that he'd have had to even if he had been working, as I've never managed to get the same person on the phone when I call back...

I got home about five.  The tech hadn't been to the house, and we still didn't have service.  No phone messages, automated or otherwise were sent, either.  We left the house around ten minutes to six because we were going to the trivia night at River Run in Plainfield (it was a blast and we almost won, our team came in second).

We were told they'd try to get the central office to do whatever it was that day, but if not then by the following Tuesday (February 21st) because Monday was a holiday.

My heart sank when I heard that the central office would be needed to do something. The voices were telling me that I needed to storm the central office where they store the DSL. I know they have it there, in vast, huge wodges, stacked high to the ceiling."

"event","I had an ace up my sleeve.. Ok, not really an ace, more like the five of spades, but it was still up my sleeve and I decided it was time to see if it would give me a full house... I think I've stretched this metaphor as far as it'll go...

Way back when I worked for SoVerNet (did I fail to mention that I worked the helpdesk for SoVerNet for two years back in the late 90s? Back then it was a great start up internet service company, I was proud of the work we did, anyway) I had met one of the Verizon engineers, Palmer.  We met the first time we were looking at building a house, and he'd been the one who'd installed my frame relay line for when I was working for SoVerNet.

Palmer is gruff and intelligent, really busy, and actually cares about providing good service, but often has his hands tied by the red tape.  He was the engineer who had been to my new house on moving day to tell me that they were going to have to run a new phone line to get us phone service.  Anyway, I still have his phone number from when I worked for SoVerNet, so I thought I'd give him a little call to see if he could shed some light on what the real problem was, and what the realistic expectation for service was (and possibly to see if he could do anything with the scheduling to get this resolved more quickly, but I was hesitant to ask for anything beyond information).

He is on vacation until the 27th (which may actually explain this backlog).  But he left a number for Denis to contact in his absence.  I tried leaving a message for Denis to see if he had any information to share, but he never called me back.  I wasn't sure how far to push it, really, so I've not tried back yet.  This was around 11:30 AM.

1:30 PM I get a call from Jennifer, she was checking in.  I told her what had happened so far, and she said she'd try to find something out then get back to me.  I had to go to the bathroom, so she left me a voicemail at 1:40 PM telling me that it was all a technician backlog and they were hoping to get the work done soon.  She also told me her last name and gave me a number to call so I could get in direct contact with her (it doesn't actually work, but her heart is in the right place.) :D"

"event","2:30 PM Jennifer called (she likes me, she really likes me) and assured me that everything was still on track for our service to go live today, and that we should be able to turn it on when we got home from work.

We got home from work and found a message, automated and time stamped 4:57 PM informing us that our service was delayed until February 24th.

I called customer service back immediately and got Lakenya, asking her what the delay was. She told me that there was an ""issue with the wiring"" and then transferred me to Andrea at my request.  Andrea is an escalation supervisor.  I was told that the wiring fix had to be done by the central office, and that Verizon's technicians are the ones who do the scheduling out of that office.  She had no idea who I could contact there directly (they hide, you see, they're elusive and shy, like the Yeti). She was very apologetic and listened patiently to my rants and complaints and retelling of the saga.  Then told me she would keep a personal eye on my order.

I informed her that I failed to see how that would accomplish anything as Jennifer had been keeping a personal eye on my account, called and told me I'd be good to go today, then an hour and a half later, I was delayed again.  How was she going to have any better information that would keep that from happening and actually get something done?  She was noncommittal but I decided I'd prefer they do something rather than nothing, so I told her I wanted her to keep an eye on the order.

I started fantasizing about different social engineering scenarios that might get me in through that huge metal door to where they keep the technicians locked up.  Maybe I could set them free and in gratitude they'd grant me one wish (which would, of course, be that I get DSL, I'm no fool!)."

Jennifer contacted many people (she said at least ten) who all told her that there is no reason we can't get DSL on our line and the delays are all due to backlogs of technicians not being able to get out to the remote terminal to do service on it.  Everyone agreed that we should be able to get DSL though.

Jennifer told me she would personally oversee my account (I fondly recalled Jason's promise but allowed myself to hope once more).  and call me if se saw any problems at all.

Sean informed me that he couldn't access New England account information.  I explained to him that I'd been bounced around several times at this point and that if he was going to transfer to please make sure they could look at my account before dumping me somewhere.

I was on hold for half an hour while he tried to find someone, though he did keep checking in with me to let me know he was still trying to find someone.  Eventually I was transferred to Howie in Springfield, MA.  Howie told me that the information he had showed that my order was still in place, and the service date was still February 14th.

"event","I'm going to put it all down here to serve as a warning or.. or maybe a morality play or... just because I have to get it out of my head.  It throbs.

I was young once, and had no grey hairs.  I was optimistic.  I was sure that SoVerNet was a worse service provider than Verizon based on the year I had them for phone and dial up service...  but I'm starting in the middle.  Let me start at the beginning... long long ago in a .... well anyway

We built our house in 2004.  In September of that year, I contacted SoVerNet for phone, long distance, and internet service.  I was informed in no uncertain terms that there were no high speed options for the neck of the woods we lived in.  That's fine, we figured someday our dream of hot and cold running internet would become a reality, besides we liked our six acres of woods, it's pretty and there are squirrels and a little thrush named ""Squeaks"".

I ordered all three services for two phone lines, so we got a pretty nice discount on the whole package and I was happy.  I told them I was moving in on November 23 and I wanted my service to start the day before that, so that it would be certain to be there when I moved in.  They assured me it would be.

It wasn't.

It wasn't there the next day, either.

Or the next.

We found out, ON MOVING DAY, that apparently no one had gone to the trouble of finding out if the phone lines had sufficient capacity for another house.  They didn't. The company needed to run a new wire to us.  We were informed there was no way they could provide DSL with this new line.  Now keep in mind this is rural Vermont, so it should have occurred to someone, like, oh, the engineers who work these lines all the time and who got the order TWO MONTHS IN ADVANCE, that a new house moving into a part of Vermont with so few people might cause a line load problem.  Well it didn't.  Everyone had a failure of imagination. So it took them until December 12th to make our service active.  SoVerNet did give us a rebate since they didin't actually start serving us until then, though they managed to take that pound of flesh back later...

Things were tooling along.  My husband was getting reasonable speeds from his dial up (around 40k or so) but my computer had a serious constipation issue, and I was seldom able to get even 20k on my dial up.  We put up with it because we'd heard there was this new technology, air cards, that would be coming out.  An air card is a card you slip into your laptop and then connect to the internet via cell signal.  It sounded promising.  Even if all it did was stay connected (we lost connection a lot with our dial up accounts).

SoVerNet's bills were inscrutible.  Nothing made much sense but we just paid them because they were around the dollar amount we were expecting them to be.  Then all the sudden, in June, we got this huge bill for like four hundred dollars.  Turned out that they hadn't been billing us for the second phone line for six months.  Just another reason we were tired of them, but we were locked into a one year contract, we couldn't escape them until December 12th or they'd charge us $250.

In July we got an air card.  Don't buy an air card. At least not until they actually make the technology work.  At first it seemed to do alright, but it has gotten worse and worse as time goes on.  It is now more a source of frustration than it is access to the internet.  The speeds are horrific, and it seems convinced that the cell towers are going out for long walks.  We put up with this for a while, then started talking about getting Satellite internet.

But we still had that contract with SoVerNet so we couldn't do anything until December.

In November, three weeks in advance, I contacted both a Satellite internet provider and Verizon.  I'd set up for the satellite provider to come out the next week to evaluate our house for service, and I put in an order for phone and long distance service from Verizon.  The salesdroid I was talking to said ""Ok, so how about DSL, do you need that?"" Which launched me into a diatribe about how it isn't available, and how stupid it is that it isn't available because there really were enough people on that road to serve it.  While I was ranting she did a line test.  Then she asked who one of my neighbors was, and did a line test on them.  They could have gotten DSL.  She did a line test on another of my neighbors. They were scheduled to be able to get DSL on December 1st.  She said we'd have to change our phone number to one of theirs (from one of SoVerNet's) I was like ""Yeah, do you want my first born baby, too?""

So I got excited, we were going to have DSL....  I'll break the rest of this saga up into smaller chunks."

So far there's only one thing and that is we'd put a door between our master bath and master bedroom. We're going to put in a curtain as soon as I can get myself motivated (we need other curtains as well, and damn they're expensive).

Frank got ill just before the holidays, but it was all relaxing and calm for us. We just lumped around the house.

We have a full set of <a href=""http://photobucket.com/albums/v252/morgannalefey/House%20Building/"">construction photos</a>, and a photo of the front near completion. The view only password is 4wombats.

We were totally without any sort of phone service for nearly a full month after moving in because no one thought ""Gee, rural Vermont, maybe we should check to make sure there are enough physical wires out there to provide phone service.""

Sovernet, our phone and internet provider were like the keystone cops, and there was a lot of misunderstanding and miscommuncation, but they made good on it in the end and eventually gave us a discount for our inconvenience. Oh, and I HATE dial up internet. It's evil and should be stamped out completely by providing high speed access everywhere. If they'd just invest in the infrastructure it *would* repay them in time. They're just in too much of a hurry for an immediate profit. Bastards. :)

We've ordered a new sectional to replace our rapidly decaying nearly ten year old one. It's not handled being moved four times very well, plus all the strain of us on the mechanisms... we got a stationary sectional this time, no mechanisms and it's only two pieces, so laying on it should be much more comfortable. :)

We're also getting a new queen mattress and box so we'll have a real guest room with a comfortable bed in it.

Daddy's talking about visiting this summer, and I'm thinking it'd be nice if I could get my Grampa to come up.

Anyway, now I'm just trying to catch up on all the things I put off while we were moving and getting settled. I've some heavy work deadlines and I've got some work to do in this MUD I'm on that I want to GET DONE finally. :)"

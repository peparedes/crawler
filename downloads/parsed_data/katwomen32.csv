"event","Time & life
life flows through time
time blends with life 
theyre not what they are
without each other

life creates purpose
purpose is limited with time
time created memories
memories are shared throughout life

life is growing constantly
it takes years and years to develope
we live longer & longer
but it seems shorter & shorter

A heartbeat is a patturn of time
each heartbeatyou hear represents
a moment in your life
no matter how small it seems

life & time both take course
in what we call a process
and the process in this world happens
only once in a human and never stops

HAHAHA ROBOTS CANT SWIM WE ARE SAFE! we got info from nigel about this robot and said Dr. Whatsisname was making them so we found his secret lair, kicked his butt, desroyed his machine that controled this robot, and that was the end of my dream.

Age: 25
Sexuality (if applicable): asexual/heterosexual
Original or Anomaly?: Anomaly (as indicated by the sex) 

<lj-cut text=""rest under here"">

Personality: Being born with the stigma of having a boys name, Rufus acts extremely masculine despite her frame. To compensate and in order to compete, Rufus learned to act like a man, walk like a man, talk like a man. Rufus doesn't dress sexily on purpose in order to be taking seriously during a meeting. She demands their attention wholeheartedly on her words and her ideas rather her cleavage. She talks in a very low voice hardly melodic often bare of any emotion, barely raising it when she's angry and even then it's hardly feminine. Her words are often cutting, and to her workers, she's brutally honest. She demands things a certain way, if it done in her way, her algorithm often there's hell to pay.

Mostly, she's like her original counterpart with the exception that she's even more deceptive because she has that added bonus of being able to use the fact that she's a very good looking woman to her advantage. She's cunning, if not a little on the quiet side, but she isn't one to be trusted. She could be smiling at you one day and another day, she could be putting a gun to your head.

The thing that she hates the most, running a company such as ShinRa that when she's discriminated as being weak, or soft just because she's a woman. If someone does that, she will prove them wrong - to this extent she's even colder than her male counterpart. She's mean, horribly mean. She doesn't want to be associated with women, nor does she want people to assume that she's too masculine. She's worked very hard to maintain a balance between the two sexes and she's managed to make a spot for herself within the top office of ShinRa as President and still have the respect and loyalty of her workers.

History: Much to his fathers chagrin, Rufus was born female. Angry that his father had only to give the company to the first male heir - and that being Rufus' half brother Lazard, Rufus was instantly had to work uphill. The name had already been chosen, and all her baby items were engraved with the name RS - to follow in her father's footprints - and President ShinRa was not going to change it then. Thus, Rufus was cursed with a male name.

Chastised with it in private school, ""Ew, Rufus is a boys name"" and ""Hahaha, you're so ugly that in order to fool people your parents gave you a boys name to try and hide the fact that you're a girl!"", Rufus compensated for being the top in everything. She was the top student, a talented pianist, military genius and business mastermind. It was roughly at the age of thirteen that against all odds, Rufus enrolled in the Junon Navy Academy to learn more about the military so that she would take over the family business. When she was twelve, her parents had a bitter divorce which led to her mother being bankrupt and being forced to move to the slums of Midgar.

For a while, Rufus hid her sex by binding the chest (which wasn't very full and quite flat) and rarely speaking unless she was spoken to. She showered late at night when no one was around, and not even going to the bathroom unless there was no one there. For the longest time, everyone thought that she was homosexual just by the way she acted and was tortured endlessly about it. In reality, Rufus never cared for relationships after watching her father and mother. Her father would cheat and in retaliation so would her mother. When she first got her period, the males in the dorm thought that she was diseased and she was taken to the male school nurse and he was the first person to realize that she was actually a he. Time went on and by sixteen, Rufus had finally started to grow into her body, all the while she lied to her father that she was in finishing school.

Rufus' sex was revealed when a group of boys decided to play a prank of the silent child and decided to strip them and haze her (him). Thankfully, Rufus got wind of this and wrote to her only father figure, a Turk that had been her nanny at the time, Tseng and asked him what to do. In the middle of the night, Rufus was taken and stripped. When they realized it was a very pretty girl, and tried to advance on her - Rufus killed her first person.

The death had been hidden by Rufus' family, but it was then that Rufus' father, intrigued that Rufus had opted to go to military school, sent him home. As a snub to Lazard, Rufus' father anointed him the Vice Presidency of ShinRa. Rufus found out about this, and was furious. She hadn't earned her title, it was just given just because ShinRa wanted to look progressive rather than backwards. Rufus held no actual power.

As time grew, Rufus began to hate her father more and more. She was a scapegoat, belittled by his higher ups and not taken seriously by the company. She craved to be recognized for her efforts - so she started to work against her father in order to gain control of the company. Caught, she was sentenced to treason, but she had forged the company into two creating factions so she peacefully agreed to be in the care of her first care takers, the Turks. Tseng taught her everything, Reno taught her how to act like a man, Rude refined and Tseng molded her into the woman that she is today. 

Strengths: Rufus is very good around weaponry; she's an excellent marksman and she can create and wire explosives. Also, she's a great leader that inspires loyalty within her employees and the people that serve her. She also manages to wind people around her finger.

Weaknesses: Her personality is not the best of them, she's cruel and unyielding. Her pride sets her back, as well as her arrogance. She's also afraid of touch, thinking that she may get hurt - to this extent, she's frail. Also, if she's belittled as a woman, she will lose her temper.

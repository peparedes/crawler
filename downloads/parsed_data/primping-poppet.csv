Excuse me, ""Other""?? I could understand if you said our income is too low (according to their standards, I'm sure it is), or our credit sucks (it does), or rental history or any other valid reasons. Other?! Don't you mean, because under ""Other names you've used to apply for housing or credit in the past seven years"" Jodie wrote ""Joseph""?! Fuck San Francisco. This is bullshit.

"event","... I've decided to become a writer of tawdry historical bodice-rippers. I won't have to deal with school boards, some awful curriculum, parents and principals, or academia. And it often pays better than teaching at a college or CSU, but hey what doesn't?

I know I can't write for shit, but that's not <i>that</i> important is it?

My papers are due, I feel sick, the acrobat can't move in, the utility bill is too high, the apartment is flooding, and for some reason I've chosen to run for a time-consuming and stressful position at work...

I hate school. I hate money. All I want to do is sew and work on this goddamn doll which is never going to be finished. (Jodie and I are/were working on an 18th century fashion doll. I'm giving up on getting it done by April because of schoolwork and things, but we're going to finish it someday and it'll be beauuuuuutiful) ... I had all of these adorable plans for her embroidered pockets and whitework sleeve flounces and quilted petticoat and all of the lovely needlework things I never get around to doing because I know I never really finish big projects... My Kabbalah professor says I need to stop sewing during class. Harumph...

I hate my Early Middle Ages class. It makes me want to puke. It feels so inhuman and weird. Hundreds of years of people rolling around in the mud, randomly deciding to go to war, and leaving the crappiest paper trail. Gad, what's the point in even trying to piece it together? Such a weird frickin period...

I should be writing a paper on 19th century Jewish acculturation... at this very moment. Oh hateful. Why didn't I write my paper on 18th century Jewry and the Haskalah? I must be lazy. Lazy lazy lazy... I think I'll eat some more creamy rabbit candies and twiddle my thumbs. Yes.

Aaaaaaaaaand I need to work on my gin project some more. I'm writing a paper on justice in London during the ""gin craze"". Awful depressing stuff.

History is a strange delight...

I tottled over to Britex yesterday and picked up some nice voile, which is the closest thing I can find to 18th century muslin (I know there was some source for muslin, but I can't remember it at all).

Of course, I totally <span style=""font-style: italic;"">suck </span>at any needlework that isn't cross-stitch. Should probably start with something like... crewel work? Is that any easier?

K, so that's my new project. Delicate whitework doesn't work so great in a military setting, but eh, I'll find somewhere to show it off.

Next will be something quilted or corded. Or new stays (Oh man, should I try to hand-stitch them like the cool kids? Hmmmm...)

.... I should probably patch up and fix my gown before I get ahead of myself though. And attach the pinked self-trim. Yeeees...

And one more thing: I'm kinda fascinated by these weird flower-pot thingies. I mean, what the hell are these girls wearing, and how do I make one?

I'm so happy to be living just a short BART ride away from Lacis :D I finally toddled over there yesterday and picked up a lucet, some silk cords, linen cord, silk ribbons, a needle case... Wow, they have everything.

"event","Hardback, trade paperback or mass market paperback?
Hardback or trade paperback. But I don't reeeally care too much...

Barnes & Noble or Borders?
No preference.

Bookmark or dog-ear?
Bookmark, as in a bit-o-paper or candy wrapper or string or ribbon or business card

Amazon or brick and mortar?
Amazon is dangerous and talks me into spending more money with promises of free shipping. I prefer real shops though. There's something very satisfying about being able to acquire new things as soon as you want them...

Alphabetize by author or alphabetize by title or random?
Originally they were organized by size and genre, but now it's all basically random

Keep, throw away, or sell?
Keep! I have a hard time throwing anything away, but sometimes I give away books if I know someone else will enjoy them more than myself.

Keep dust jacket or toss it?
Keep it. They're purty.

Read with dust jacket or remove it?
Remove it. Annoying things.

Short story or novel?
Oooh decisions decisions. I like cheap thrills and I have the attention span of a seven-year-old boy who's just had 3 espressos and a bag of skittles... So I should say short stories. I don't usually end up finishing the books that I start.

Harry Potter or Lemony Snicket?
Lemony Snicket. They make me, er, laugh out loud... But I really need to catch up on that series...

Stop reading when tired or at chapter breaks?
Both. Or when I see a flash of light, hear a creak of a door, see a person walking by, hear a gunshot, etc...

""It was a dark and stormy night"" or ""Once upon a time""?
Neither, or both? A dark and morbid fairy tale?

Buy or borrow? New or Used?
I love used books. They're cheap and I like reading people's little notes in the margins like ""I can't believe she said that!"" and ""This shows God's love for all His creatures"" and ""YES""

Buying choice: book reviews, recommendations, or browse?
All of the above. Usually browsing though.

Tidy ending or cliffhanger?
Tidy prettyplease

Morning reading, afternoon reading, or night-time reading?
Late night reading, or break-at-school reading

Stand-alone or series?
I haven't read many good series, and they usually start to go downhill at some point, so I'm going to have to say stand-alone.

Favorite series?
Haven't read many series. Hm. Um... Anne Rice, Lemony Snicket, Harry Potter, Scarlet Pimpernel? Ok, that's a sad list... Does Varney the Vampire count? 

Favorite children's book?
The Little Prince!! The 7-Year-Old Wonder Book! Peter Rabbit!

Favorite YA book?
Whooeee, all I can remember is ""Daddy Long Legs"" and ""The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle"". Yay sugardaddies and crossdressing.

Favorite book of which nobody else has heard?
Um... that gold book of historical erotica which my brother has taken away to Pasadena?

Favorite books read last year?
Lolita, Life Mask...

Favorite books of all time?
For silly sentimental reasons: Dracula, Moll Flanders, and The Scarlet Pimpernel. For barely better reasons: Lolita, Slammerkin, Diary of a Drug Fiend, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, The Bell Jar, and Valis

Least favorite book you finished last year?
I don't end up finishing books that are terrible (like whichever one of those Jacqueline Kerry books that I just couldn't bring myself to finish... The first one was great, the 2nd was a little annoying, but the 3rd looked like it was going to be painful so...). 

What are you reading right now?
""Wits, Wenchers, and Wantons"" by E.J. Burford, ""Napoleon"" by Paul Johnson (for school, and yes I am So Slow), and ""The Gentleman's Daughter"" by Amanda Vickering.

What are you reading next?
Either finishing Pamela or finally picking up Clarissa, Tom Jones, Neverwhere, or Les Liaisons Dangereuses.

Favorite book to recommend to an eleven-year-old?
I know I loved ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" and ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" around then, and ""The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle""-- it had all of these marvy descriptions of ships and saltiness and whatnot. Kids like that, right?

Favorite book to reread?
I barely reread books, but for some reason I've read Maus sooo many times since 1st or 2nd grade, I stopped counting...

Do you ever smell books?
Aaaaah, worm-eaten papery...

Do you ever read primary source documents?
I have to for school, but just for kicks I like reading diaries, court documents, inventories, ads and all that. That's all mostly limited to what I can find online or in books though, as I do live in SF and the archives out here generally only deal with local history. Sad stuff."

All I want to do is make petticoats and dainty things, read guiltlessly (there are so many things I don't read for ""fun"" because I feel guilty about not getting my reading for school done), socialize guiltlessly, go to the zoo and museums and libraries and archives and playparties and balls and explore and enjoy the city... get drunk at Mission Dolores park, fire dance at the beach, clown at Embarcadero, have a picnic, seduce the world, be a tiny Chinese acrobat... live in a Victorian doll house, fill the alcoves with saints, create something beautiful, be a Maurice Sendak beastie...

"event","Thousand Oaks is warm. And it has seasons! The leaves die and fall here, the air looks orange and firey, and there's some certain ashiness about. It's wonderful, and dammit, I miss it. San Francisco has a kind of Autmun that I'm just not used to. There's the nip in the air, and no Santa Anna winds.

Being back ""home"" with my folks is so strange. THe place is clean and smells like frustration. I suddenly fall back into the habit of pacing in this house. I used to do that all the time, think and pace because there's nothing to do here and I had no means of escape. Bah. But ya know, it's good to be back, and talk to Bronwyn at length. She's an awesome kid. Basically.

So hey I'm bored. I can't even go on my usual websites here. Or use AIM. Oh woe. Woe. I should do homework. Woe. I can't wait to go back already. Heh."

DAMMIT I need to make a black pvc corset. I have tons of the material and I don't have super-special not-every-day club-wear (other than the silver corset, but I can't be spacey all the time...). If only I had one of those nice JUKIs at home...

Last night at work was fucking INSANE and there are sales girls who I want to SMACK. All-fucking-ready. Yep, first huge rush and I already want to smack someone.

I only did 3 pairs of pants (and nearly destroyed another pair) but I was horribly busy the whole night. Didn't even go to fittings. I was just freaking out a blindstitch machine which didn't like me and the phone (which by-the-way has no handy list of extensions, which really made trying to get ahold of people difficult). Aiii.
Oh, and I kicked that midterm's tush. Gilgamesh and Akhenaton are MINE. I feel smart...

Time to get back to laundry/cleaning/finding clean pantyhose...."

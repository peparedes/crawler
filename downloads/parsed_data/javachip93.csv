And I realized..I don't want this performance to end..I don't want Marta and Aaron to leave. =(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I thought of something..maybe that's why the show isn't the best...because no one wants you guys to leave and they're <EM>trying&nbsp;</EM>to make it look bad...just a thought I thought I'd share....I need a hug. =(</P>

"event","<P>Hello everyone. It is officially 1 DAY until Princess and the Pea..kinda nervous? To tell you the truth..I'm really depressed today. I don't know why..but I think I have an idea. I'm going to miss Martha and Aaron so much next year..wow. I'm really glad I got close to you guys this year! I have put off the feeling for far too long..I need to face the facts..I love you, seniors. &lt;3</P>
<P>So, i'm pretty stoked, though because my mother let me skip school today (acted like i was too tired to function!) and now, I get to update..because I haven't in a while..I guess I've been too busy. What with the show and everything.</P>
<P>So, my mum (&lt;3 you bb) wants me to home school next year? good idea? I'm not too sure yet..there are some ups and downs..first of all, I would have to see my mother everyday and never be able to get away from her and i would have no social life (except for you guys!) but I would also have to go and take Fcat at some random school..weird?&nbsp;I think so..But there are some good things too, I guess. I could sleep late and teach myself at my own pace..and I could learn so much more than those STUPID schools teach..also I could travel way more, and not have to worry about exams..hmm..as you can see, I'm in indecision so if you have any advice..that would be great. =)</P>
<P>Has anyone heard of the Perishers? They are truly amazing. SO good! Kati, Abbi, and Addie, I will try to burn your cds as soon as possible! So anyway, they are from Sweeden and the lead singer is the most beautiful&nbsp;guy I <EM>have </EM>ever seen in my whole entire life..and this is no joke..I'm positive this is the guy for me (well besides the&nbsp;fact that he's way way way older than me..lol)&nbsp;I'm guessing he's&nbsp;in his mid 20's..so that's not bad I guess.&nbsp;His name is Ola and that means ""wave""....gorgeous name or what? I would tell you his last name..but it's some random&nbsp;Sweedish name that has those two&nbsp;dots above the letters..lol! </P>
<P>HAPPY BIRTHDAY&nbsp;MARTHA!!!! WE LOVE YOU!&nbsp; =)</P>
<P>*see everyone tonight. wow..dress rehearsal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>"

"event","<P>Tonight i was alone for a while, and I had a lot of time to think. I haven't realized how soon, we are going to have to face the fact that it is Aaron and Martha's <U>last</U> performance with Ballet Pensacola..unless ofcourse they come back and guest artist..which would be amazing..especially when you both are out famous somewhere! &lt;3</P>
<P>The Sarah McLachlan concert last night was simply amazing. I was completely speechless..I guess, I didn't realize how much I love her and her music! The opening band was great, too. They were called the Perishers..they're from Sweeden and the lead singer/gutarist is the most beautiful guy I have ever seen. No joke, this is my true love right here. Emily got a really good picture of him, and I'll show it to you guys..I'll try to figure out how to post it, too..=) Too bad, I got home at like 12:30 and forgot I had homework to complete for the next day..so I definetly was like falling asleep, trying to do my homework...what a site <EM>that </EM>must have been!</P>
<P>This morning, my school has a ""comittee"" called the Welcoming Committe, and I'm one of the 6th grade representatives, and we had this big orientation for the 5th graders coming to our school next year for 6th grade. And I totally got out of 2 and a half classes this morning..not to mention the 1/2 of class we all hid in our guidance counsleors office! It was hilarious..I guess you had to be there. ; )</P>
<P>So, I am officially a Harry Potter loser at my school..yea thanks a lot BB. ; )&nbsp;&nbsp;And today I heard someone say ""Oh my god..Have you heard? Elle's turned into a Harry Potter freak.&nbsp;And&nbsp;it hurt real bad..but I also thought it was funny, because the person who said it is probably a pot head..! I should totally wear a cloak to school on Monday and be like ""I shall be boarding the Hogwarts Express, shortly. Any goodbyes?"" I can picture it..can't you?</P>
<P>I have become a huge fan of hot tea. Especially lemon zinger and rasberry zinger. mmm..so yummy!</P>
<P>It's funny because, whenever I decide I'm going to update, I never know what to write at first. But after I get going a bit, things just keep pouring out of my brain and my fingers! Sorry, if this entry is long. You don't have to read the whole thing..although if you are reading this right now, that means you read the whole thing from top to bottem, and I love you for that. It makes me happy when people read my entry and comment..</P>
<P>-Focus on the important things, like real life. Don't get too caught up in more interesting, less important things, like fantasy. &lt;3 you </P>"

<P>I'm kinda nervous that tech week is next week and we haven't even finished choreographing it, yet! I guess it'll come together the night of dress rehearsal like always, though! It's going to be an amzing show..not to mention an emotional one..i don't even want to think about it yet, anyway. </P>

<P>I really want to go shopping. Sorry I didn't stop by and see you today, Kati. Hopefully I'm going tomorrow, but I don't think you're working then anyway.</P>
<P>I feel like I need a good cry. That probably sounds weird, but for some reason, I just realized there is so much shit going on in my life right now, and I really haven't let out my feelings at all. I guess I bottle up my emotions, too Ashleigh.</P>
<P>I need some sun. I hope it's sunny tomorrow, so I can lay out...although, if it's not sunny my mom said she might take my shopping! yess! I need more polo's. I've outgrown all except one. Is it normal for me to be growing this fast? I can't tell you how many clothes I've outgrown in the past few months! Ohh...I really feel like Cinnabon! mmm...I don't know why, but that made me think of bubble baths for some reason, and I want one! I think i'll go take one.</P>

<P>today was probably the worst day at school. i made my first D...i was sad too..because everyone else (even the stupid kids) made better grades than i did on this sheet..well except for this kid who made a 35%..lol. it was in science, and it was all about compunds..really dont understand it, if someone older wants to help me! =) (once again..another wake up call for elle!)</P>

"event","<P>Last night I went to Haley Gross's bah mitzvah, and there it was incredible! I never knew I could have so much fun when I was so dressed up. It was like something inside of me was waiting to burst open, and boy, did I let lose! After dancing all day at rehearsal, dancing that night was the most relaxing thing ever! It was like a was a different person...I had no care in the world...not even when people started stepping on my injured toenail, all I could do was *love*. I wish I were that person all of the time, but you know..I don't think anyone can be that perfect...but I <EM>did</EM> read a motto that I love and I'm going to repeat it in my head when someone gets on my last nerve.</P>

"event","<P>ok so i have a story to tell finally...so a while ago..probably 2 weeks ago i stubbed my toe in the pool and i thought it was no big deal, but then i find out i cracked the center of my toenail. it wasnt too big at first, but then the crack started growing and now it has made itself right into the center of my toenail. so today at rehearsal i was having a real tough time with my hugmongo blister (that i was trying to suck it up) and my toenail which hurt like crap with the pressure of my pointe shoes against it. so after probably 4 hours of dancing i take off my pointe shoes and the crack has gotten really bad and it hurts everytime i walk on it. so i tell my mom and she gets kinda worried and calls my pediatrist but <U>ofcourse</U> they arent open today. so my crazy mother takes my to the ER to see if they can atleast check it out or whatever...so after about 30 minutes of waiting we finally get a doctor and he looks at my&nbsp;toenail (looking completely grossed out) and (ok this is where it gets bad...) he LIFTS THE TOENAIL (ahhhhhh...hurt SOOO BAD) and then puts is down again and after many minutes of examination he says ""go see your pediatrist because i have no idea what to do about toenails"".....made me sooo mad..he was just sitting there playing with my toenail and then says he doesnt have a clue about what to do...anyway class on monday is gonna be harsh for me..i dont even&nbsp;want&nbsp;to think about&nbsp;it..</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>bb, this is for you...i just finished reading&nbsp;the&nbsp;chapter ""flesh, blood, and bone"" and it made me want to cry so bad...im kinda scared to read on, because i dont want&nbsp;voldermort to kill harry ( i mean i know he cant because there are 3 books left but still) but i'll keep you updated on where i am in the book...lol..its taking forever to read it isnt it?! its because the book's so thick its real hard to haul it around school everyday..lol</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>along with being traumatized (lol..jk) im really excited because i got glasses again! for those of you who didnt know..i've had contacts for a while and i havent worn glasses in forever so my old glasses are way out of date. so i got new ones and&nbsp;I LOVE THEM!! im gonna wear them all the time..except at dance so...lol&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>i cant believe how much we had doing group counseling today, guys!! haha..never knew it could be soo much fun!! im feeling a little mischievous..hmm..mischievous reminds me of kati's ""sneaky"" icon!! LOL</P>"

Yep, it's that time already.  My stuff's all packed, most of it loaded in the truck, and I have a destination and a vague idea of how to get there.
Should be interesting.
All the more so, since I will have no car or apartment of my own once I do get there, and work starts next week Monday.
(hotel and rental are reserved, I'm not totally stupid.  Just slightly crazy.  And I can live with that.)

Depending on what internet access is like during the 2,000+ miles between here and there, I might or might not update with any interesting tidbits of travel-induced wisdom along the way.  All I know right now, is that 2,000 miles is a long distance to cover in less than a week with no cruise control...

I am so getting a tiny little convertible when I'm there."

Torn between secure routine and wanderlust,
I ride the dragon's dual natured philosophy.
Private, secluded, I have watched the world pass in a voyeuristic haze.
Opportunity now thrusts forth the adventurous spirit, forcing a spreading of new wings.
A mere chance of fate, conspiring to unbar the window, unleash the caged beast?
True freedom is a rare and fleeting thing.
An exquisite, ephemeral gift that will not wait.
Unlike the dog chained in a lavish yard,
I bear no longer any collar to hold me down.
Seek the same fences and known refuges?
Or fly far and free?
How far can my new wings carry me?
I will soar the jet stream, embark on a new quest,
but always mindful of the sun,
that I do not follow Icarus to his fate.

"event","<i>Backdated entry #1 (I'm just going to use the month of October here to post any ""found writings.""  If their originating date is known, it will be mentioned at the top of the post)

This was originally written 12-26-2001, no changes or corrections are made from the original, merely transference from pen & ink to pixels and bytes.  If it seems to vary grammatically from my more recent writings, that is why.
It is a recollection of a dream from which I had freshly awoken:</i>

""I awake into the dream.  As I open my eyes  try to gather in the surroundings to evaluate the situation that I find myself in.  I am standing at the foot of my bed, gazing around.  I see her lying there in the bed, appearing to be almost asleep.  This is so familiar, as if I had been here before.  Though I cannot guarantee that what I feel is true, I have the sense this is my room, it belongs to me and always has.  Yet something is not quite right.  The bed.  I recall that it should be at least a queen size, but now it is a twin.
The girl looks to me and becons me to return to the warmth of the bed with her, as if I had just a moment before lept from her inviting company.
I hesitate, trying to sort out the details.  I can recall having been in this place before, with her, yet with the aforementioned larger bed.  It feels like a flashback to something I had dreamed of the night before, or was I merely dreaming that I had dreamed it?  I cannot recall clearly.
I almost ask the girl about this and to m varying perception of the bed size, yet do not, almost afraid that if I prove a contradiction that should not be, I will wake and lose her forever.
Which brings me back to the girl.  I only wish I could recall the name of such a creature who has so simply and truly captured my heart.  She s one of the most truly alluring and beautiful creatures I have ever laid eyes on.  I know that she is not human, but remarkably close in appearance, just inhuman enough to make her nearly angelic in my eyes.  All that is beautious and innocent, and completely lacking of the hate and the spite that always has and will forever doom mankind.  She is like a pixie or an amazing bioconstruct (I would rather it not be, but seems open as a possibility), either descended or constructed for the sole purpose of being a companion spirit, to soothe and comfort a troubled soul.  In this case, she seems inexplicably attracted to me, and this unnerves me, I do not feel worthy to be so near to such a creature.  But she allays my fears, calming my troubled heart as she speaks soothingly to me.  I cannot recall any details of the conversation, no matter how hard I try, but the details are not important, for her voice has had the desired effect.  I take my place and rejoin her in a warm, loving embrace.
Her presence and radiant loving touch is what i need to sooth my rambeling ponderings and put my mind and heart at ease to allow me to rest.
I can only hope that I am once again graced by her presence in another dream someday
12-26-01""


<i>It is rare for me to remember dreams (always has been), even more so for me to have the clarity of mind to recall enough details in order to write them down upon waking.  Alas, I do not recollect having been visited by my mysterious friend since.</i>"

"event","There is so much left undone, so many places still unseen.
I have been comfortable here for a while, steady and secure for longer than any other time in my life.
Now that is to change.
It wasn't my decision to make this my time, but the opportunity is now.
For too long I have settled down without reason, without necessity into a life approaching stagnation.  Security and complacency for myself and nobody else.
I have watched from the sidelines as others have grown and changed and ventured forth into the great unknown, always thinking ""someday, I will too.""  But I have been comfortable for too long, having it easy and safe where I am now without cause or necessity to venture outside my known realm.
Market forces now have thrust me to a crossroads.  Continue on just down the road from the place I now occupy, or venture forth into the great unknown?  Maintain as close to the status quo as possible, or take a chance to do something radical?
The heart of the wanderer knows it wants to go, but not quite where.  To leave behind the known stability is a great leap of faith for one who professes little.  Certainly t'would be easier to have assistance in making the decision, telling me what to do and where to go, but the strive for independance requires this decision be made on my own.
I have long told myself it would only be a matter of time before the decision was changed from a mere option to an absulute necessity.  The date has now been set.  Now it is only a matter of which direction and how far.  Le jeux sont fete.  I now venture forth on a new quest."

"event","This is a short list of the authors who have influenced me throughout my life.

Madeleine L'Engle - my favorite author from my elementary school days.
Through her work (the Wrinkle in Time series), it taught me that harboring a more intellectual view of the world was not a disadvantage, that science and fantasy need not be a source of shame.

Isaac Asimov, J.R.R. Tolkein - both grandmasters in the fields of science fiction and fantasy respectively, I first read their works while in middle school. These two authors helped to build upon the grandness and visions started by L'Engle, but brought in a new sense of scale.  Gone are the days of simple individual-focused stories of minor consequence, now the tales encompass many nations and span the stars themselves.  This taught me to dream big.

Wendy Pini - the discovery of the Elfquest saga of comic books in my mid-teens was probably one of the most satisfying finds in my life.  Sure, they were still comic books about a fantasy world, but they brought a sense of real maturity that is often lacking in the comics industry.  Not to mention the idealisms brought forth at a very influential point in my life helped to give me part of my unique outlook on life.

Robert A. Heinlein - THE grand-master of science fiction was first brought to my attention when in college.  Some of his works could probably be among the best recruitment products for any military looking for eager recruits.  Where Asmiov's stories tend to be about ordinary people doing ordinary things during extreme times, Heinleins are about the ordinary individual rising to spectacular capability under extreme events.  Everpresent in his works are the sense of pride and optimism, which make for easy and fun reading.  Not to mention his tendencies to illustrate personal philosophies and biases which can be construed as strong social commentary to get the reader thinking about how it applies to the real world."

"event","Once again I find myself far from home in spite of the weather.
Wandering, prowling, searching with a purpose, I come seeking more.
Last time was just a tease, not enough to fulfill.
Not even close to sating the urge.
Countering common sense, I brave the cold and the snow to return.
I come seeking more.  More pain, and through that pain a sort of clarity.
It is a means to an end.
A journey not yet half over, but better defined each time.
Not quite an addiction, more perhaps a mild obsession.
One which I find the urge to feed every now and again.

"event","<br>And so it began.
<br>Another day, at first blush destined to fade into the eternal now of monotony, destined to recede into history forgotten and unremarkable.
<br>But not quite.
<br>The scent of anticipation hung in the air.
<br>A hint of hesitation was lost within the restlessness.
<br>Something was going to happen today...but not yet.  Not so early, the day is too fresh.  Patience must be exercised.
<br>This is not the first time, nor likely to be the last, but it is just as permanent.  Just as significant.
<br>The time would be of my choosing, the location carefully scouted out.
<br>The eagerness threatening to bubble over, to reveal the clandestine desires, but in the end held in check through dogged determination.  This must not be rushed.
<p>
<br>At long last, monotony had eaten the last of the sunlight.  The fated hour drew near.  With a sense of nervous intrepidation, I set out for the chosen destination.
<br>A fair distance from home, but not too far to make the journey uncomfortable.  Fighting the busy roads, lost in the masses, nervously checking and rechecking the time as the hour comes all too quickly, not waiting for my arrival.  Unrelenting, I forge ahead.  Time is no longer the enemy, there is only the act to be done.
<p>Here.  I have arrived.  A dark alley in a strange town.  This is the location I have sought under cover of night.  Now time and place are right, all that remains is patience and perseverance.
<br>The cold air chills my skin, tensing slightly.  Odd noises buzz my ears, a faint, anitseptic odor crosses my nostrils.  Hours of preparation have led to this, and yet apprehension still remains.
<br>And it begins.  The first sharp pains etch the skin of my back, trying to break through.  I can feel every exquisite detail, every excruciating moment as it happens.
<br>This is what I have quested for these past several years.  The goal that I have sought against common reason.
<br>Hour after hour the pain drags on as I am transformed.  The cool air on my skin contrasting with the biting pain, feeling it crawl inch by inch, feeling the new form emerge.  
<br>I dare not cringe, I dare not flinch as I resist the urge to cry out, the urge to flee.  
<br>No.  
<br>I must remain, endure, persevere, as I allow the pain to transcend, leaving it's mark permanently etched within my flesh.
<br>By the midnight hour the first phase is complete.  The initial step is done, and my path is cemented.
<p>
<br>Once more, I am become the dragon.<br>

"event","No matter where I turn, there it is.
No matter how far or how fast I try to run away, it always follows.
My lifelong demon, my shade.
The only thing to have accompanied me everywhere I have gone,
And all to eager to follow wherever I will go.
I try to escape, but fall back into old habits.
I refuse to give in, yet still it comes back to haunt.

It is the one thing I must escape,
The one thing that can destroy me.
And yet it is the one thing that has truly shaped who I am,
Defined and developed my character,
Provided me with keenest of insight,
Given me the strength to fight on,
Day after day.
It haunts, 
Taunting me with what I know I am lacking,
Focusing the light on my weaknesses.
Yet I persist.
I survive.
I persevere.

To leave it all behind now would be to abandon the one constant of my life.
And as such I cannot leave it behind,
For it has so ingrained, so shaped my life,
That I am no longer capable of leaving it.
I can get up and walk away from anything else,
everything else that I may have held dear.
And in doing so, it only makes my muse, my nemesis all the stronger.

Not yet beyond hope, not quite beyond redemption,
But every day it grows stronger.
My need for it grows as it subtly destroys me,
Shapes me toward a haunting reality that I dread, yet know may be inevitable.
I have nearly exhausted my personal stamina fighting it,
Only to feed the inner demons further,
Hearing them calling me, taunting me.
I know what must be done, I know what is required.
I also know I can not do it alone.
But my guardian demon has driven me so far along,
Nearly ensuring its own survival.

Here I sit, a trumpeter in the strings section,
waiting for a conductor to lead me through the score..."

"event","There are no answers to life.
There is no 'purpose'.
Life is but a series of tolerances, of what we are dealt by nature and society, and what we are willing to put up with.
And humanity is extremely tolerant and adaptable to challenge.
There is no All High And Mighty.
There is no Guardian Spirit.
There is just us.
Humanity.
And all we have are our dreams.
Our desires to push the boundry, to explore, to venture forth, to tackle the impossible, and then asks ""what's for breakfast?"", ever hungry for more.

Our thoughts, our ideas can carry us to the heavens and beyond, or they can mire us into submission and despair.
Humans have evolved the unique ability to exploit our environment to our will, and having spread to encompass virtually all inhabitable terrain, our environment is the whole of the Earth herself.
With such massive, yet still finite resources at our command, there is no reason we shouldn't be able to progress.
And yet we find ways and reasons and excuses not to.
We find ways to stifle free-thought, to stall progress (or at least slow it down), to resist growth and adaptability and new ideas.

As a species we are incredibly inventive - the reason for our adaptability and success, yet also the reason for our own downfall.
Only through major calamity or deliberate intent can our progressions be stopped, and yet we always seem to find a way to resist evolution, to test the limits of our tolerance for interference.

Societal, social inventions and customs are our ties to our past, yet such ties also serve to stifle in some instances when adherence overcomes reason.
Virtually all social limitations are enacted as a response to enhance the survivability of their cluster of humanity, but as a dynamic species, we are often overcome by nostalgia and stubborn resistance to the counter-intuitive such that we are blinded by the necessity of evolution of our own society, of when it is time to change our own customs.
From time to time, the situations/hazards that necessitated certain regulations of society no longer pose the threat they once did, and yet we all-too-willingly adhere to outmoded customs against modern reason and rationalization.
Mankinds only remaining natural enemy that poses a real threat is ourselves.

Cultural enlightenment will not come until such a realization is taken up by a much more vast swath of the populace than myself, such that it takes root in the hearts and minds of the majority to bring forth fresh ideas, to tear down old stifling ideologies, to allow humanity to achieve universal peace and prosperity.
From such cultural upheaval, our imaginations will be unbridled, our inventiveness freed, and we can finally realize the dreams we secretly long for will at long last be within our grasp, allowing us to delve from the deepest depths to the heavens and far beyond, our own spirit encompassing everything in between."

I am the man who died when the paramedics stopped treating me as soon as they realized I was transsexual.

I am the person who feels guilty because I think I could be a much better person if I didn't have to always deal with society hating me.

I am the man who stopped attending church, not because I don't believe, but because they closed their doors to my kind.

I am the person who has to hide what this world needs most, love.

I am the gay man who spent over half a decade trying to deny who I am and who I love because God supposedly says I should.

"event","(in other words, the things that pass through my head at 2am when I'm trying to sleep)


I am become the dragon.
Not necessarily a part of this world,
but within it nonetheless.

I have acquired myself a perch, a lair
filled it with a lifetime's worth of treasure
-treasures I do not even dare to count.
Each brings forth its own memories, either direct or associated.
-memories I dare not often bring forth
lest they draw me in and I lose the present.
The present of distraction, of denial
The mask I have built and wear
so I can bear to face the world, those outside.

I am comfortable within my lair
-I can lose myself within the myriad of treasures
 and private distractions, enough to pull me in
 and away for perhaps nearly another lifetime.
But like the caged animal, I long to be free
-free o fmy private cell, free to roam,
 free to wander, to experience, to slake a bottomless curiosity.
And yet I ne'er dare venture too far, too long
from the security of my lair, my solitude.

Too many distractions...
too little interactions...
Lest I reign in the introspective curiosity
Lost I may become to the external reality

I may share the embodied traits of the dragon,
But I need not share his solitary fate.

"event","What is an infomaniac?  I'm not quite sure, but it's probably me.
When you spend every waking hour in pursuit of some kernel of knowledge, some may call you driven.
If this knowledge centers around a specific theme, you may be a specialist.
If this field of focus is the area of employment, you are lucky and probably highly successful.
If this focus of information is tightly centered around one or a few hobbies, one might applaud your passionate pursuit of an extra-curricular activity, or at the very worst excentric.
However, if the drive to learn has no divineable theme, no identifiable connecting line, serves no higher purpose other than to amuse random curiosities, one runs the risk of knowing a very little bit about a very broad range of probably useless topics.
Such an obsession can be dangerous.
Unless one strives to be a professional diletante, one must be careful not to lose track of time and life in the ever-fascinating realm of the newshound/infojunkie/ravenous slaking of curiosity.
As the dishes wait around to be washed, the housework waits to be done, artistic hobbies  and software skills go unpracticed, video games await the opportunity to be played, I keep finding myself falling into the trap of the internet.
24/7 connectivity, feeding a vast wealth of information and imagery ranging from political world views to local curiosities and attractions to detailed techinical instructions and inspirations to random gatherings and events to amusing webcomicy-goodness to useless babblings to irate diatribes and inflammatory derogitizations to pornography to pirated music and movies and everything in between.
The information superhighway has become my playground, taking me far faster and farther than the local interstate, and occupying my time even moreso.
What draws me in? What holds me here?
The insatiable thirst for the instructional to the inane, anything to distract and amuse and inform me.
I am an infomaniac.

Besides, what else am I to do at 1am?"

"event","The old game remains, so much is supposed to be new, 
yet still feels the same.
And then there's the new game, so much is different, 
yet it feels so like its forebears.
Both are calling to me, clamoring for me,
Yet now so much has changed.
So many other pursuits.
So many other dreams.
So many other toys.
Yet still I hear the calls, the longing, the memories of the days past.
How much has really changed?
Am I really that much different from back then?
Could I pick up where I left off?
What else would I leave behind if I did?
Would it really matter if I did or did not?
Have I really changed?
Or merely traded one distraction for another?

So many questions unanswered,
So many paths not traveled,
So many dreams abandoned,
So little time in this mortal world,
So many pursuits and potentials for the mind and body.
Which to take?
Which to avoid?
Follow one with unblinking steadfastness?
 - and lose the variety of choice and chance?
Browse them all at merely a surface level?
 - and never know true depth and understanding?

Such is the fate of the sentient mind.
Awash with potential,
yet destined to fall short of the impossible dreams."

That's because you're socially liberal - likely pro-choice and pro-gay rights.

You're also not so afraid of big goverment, as long as it benefits people and not politicians.

I think this quiz was rigged slightly -- there weren't enough ""none of the above"" answers in regards to ""who do you trust"" type questions.  Though I resent being labeled as any particular political party (I prefer ""staunchly independant""), I do agree for the most part with the comments above regarding the political persuasion."

"event","You heard me right.
I have no love lost for this 'holiday.'

Though it may not be as much of a sham as 'sweetest day' brought about by the greeting card industry, I still feel no compulsion that I need to honor it with my hard-earned money.
It's almost as bad as that other nationally obsessive orgy of commercial greed and violence-fueling societal plague coming up in the next few days that is the illegitimate orgasm of the football industry, which I shall also be anti-celebrating.  At least the stuporbowl might be semi-useful to me this year in that there is a concert by a local symphony that same afternoon, which should make it easier for me to get tickets to.  Or a single ticket, at least, since that's all I could really make use of. (f*** you, Valentines day)

It's a damn good thing I don't like getting drunk, because I could probably have plenty of excuses to do so.  Especially this time of year.


It's been too long,
Why should I carry on?
How could I know,
How could I care again?
Does it matter anymore?
Did it really matter before?

This isn't how it used to be.
What the hell happened to me?
I was always so carefree,
I didn't have to look,
love would always find me.

But that is long gone,
life has moved on.
Need surpassed desire,
sacrificed, supplanted.
Independence had taken hold
when all the old opportunities had gone.

Now I just sit and wonder.
Have I gone too far?
Left too much behind?
Can I begin again?
How would I try?"

"event","Welcome to a new segment of my online blog:  the Website Spotlight, where I give to you, my readers, my thoughts and opinions on a website out there that I find amusing, educational, or otherwise entertaining and worthy of being shared.

Todays site comes to us from the creative mind of Susan Stepney, Professor of Computer Science, University of York, UK

The backstory:  As you may well know from previous entries, I am a professional nerd, and I don't hide this fact.  It's not the most glamorous of occupations, but it pays the bills.  While I am officially a ""Software Engineer"" I have had very little opportunity over the past 4+ years to put to use the programming and software development skills I paid a lot of money to learn back in college (and am still paying off).  Recently (as in the past couple months) I have come to realize I need to relearn some of those skills if I am to make myself marketable for future employment opportunities, so I have been attempting (slowly) to re-teach myself C and C++ programming, to go along with the tiny bit of Perl that I actually learned on the job.  A friend of mine has recently renewed his interest in technical education as well, and wants to learn scripting, for which I recommended Perl.  However, in order to take the scripting course at his college, he needs a regular programming course first, most likely C.  I was contemplating the best way to describe the differences in programming languages to him, and an old joke that I'd first seen in the late '90's back in college popped into my mind.  Being in the thick of University techno-learning at the time, of course the joke list of ""How to shoot yourself in the foot"" in various programming languages had come across my monitor on at least a few occasions.  Being a student learning (or having recently studied) Pascal, C, C++, Visual Basic, COBOL, and assembly languages, this was particularly comedically relevant at the time.
So, I'd decided to dig this listing up from the internet (I knew something this geeky would HAVE to still exist somewhere out there) to see if it had Perl, C and whatever else to show to my friend (it's amusing AND educational).
Here's the one I chose (in other words, what google gave me first):
http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/joke/foot.htm

It was a decent collection, having what might be an original listing, updated variants (more languages, including Perl), and expanded versions to include operating systems and databases.


While an extended listing of one joke may be nice and all, how is it worthy of a Website Spotlight, you ask?  Ah, this is where my curiosity got the better of me.
Noticing the link in the upper left that implied this was merely one of potentially many techie jokes on this site, I followed it back one level to this:
http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/joke/index.htm

Perhaps not the Holy Grail of computer-related jokes, but it does contain many fine examples from the past several years, including the Apple Newton's translation of Lewis Carrol's classic Jabberwocky(http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/joke/jabber.htm), Tablespoons(http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/joke/table.htm)


Jokes alone, while amusing and vast in number, do not a complete internet experience make.  Once again my curiosity got me to wondering what was hiding in the 'home' link:
http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/index.htm

A clean, simple layout, technical information at the top (work/university programs of the author, etc.), things typical of a generic University staff-member page.  Following these, are various interests, from book reviews to factiods to musical tastes, with plenty of information on every subject included.  Very detailed and indepth, well organized information, presented in clean HTML.  On a wide variety of subjects, some of which might be expected, others a pleasant surprise, all showing a great depth of experience.  This is why Susan Stepney's website has become my first Website Spotlight.
Thank you.

"event","Another former girlfriend has gotten married (possibly the last of the few whom I kept track of), and I'm happy for her, even though she will never know it (we haven't spoken in a year or two -- fortunately I still have a source).
Another former friend from that same era is now engaged as well, I wish them the best (as if they'd ever see this).
And another former girlfriend is expecting her first child, I'll be congratulating them shortly (she was married about 4 years ago, nice ceremony, only one I've been to with dual pastors - one from each church).
And here I am, not even certain if I've satisifed my New Year's resolution, and it's almost Thanksgiving.  
At least this year I hope to be able to make it back to my parents' for the holiday, the last couple years having been sidetracked by attending other peoples' weddings out-of-state.
Such journeys can be happy, yet also depressing.  At times it makes me want to plan my own ceremony to force everyone to travel somewhere just for me, but I know that won't happen.  I do not intend to do things like that out of spite.  It breeds unnecessary tension in life to act out of spite in such a manner.  I wish them all well with their lives and journeys, and continue on my own way.  Besides, most other people have obligations that would keep them from travelling as I have done for them, even if they would be inclined to do so in the first place.
And I don't have any intentions of requiring such a thing in the forseeable future anyways.  Certain things would need to be in place for that, and quite frankly they just aren't working that way.  Such is not my luck.  La suerte de lost tontos.

At least work is now showing some faint glimmers of hope for change, but time will tell just how brightly those shine, or if I need to start preparing my resume in a few months.  
Heh, maybe I can finally start getting paid for work that really does line up with what I studied back in college.  Now that I've managed to forget most of the details. :P"

"event","Religion is the cursed blessing of the 2004 election.
The Republicans know this, and exploited it to their advantage in a brilliantly devious manner.

Many people are unable, unwilling, incapable of accepting an attempt to question their faith.
That is because Religion offers a stable, rarely changing foundation on which people can base their guiding direction in life.  Religion provides a moral compass, a way to divine right from wrong.  It offers a purpose to a potentially otherwise disparing life experience.  It may be the only source of stability and guidance in a tumultuous existance.  It becomes Faith -- the set of core truths which guide every action, every conscious thought to which an individual would willingly lay claim.
And who better to tell someone the immutable truths of the universe than the person who claims divine influence over one's eternal life (and sometimes afterlife)?  As such, people are often immersed in the beliefs of their 'chosen' religion from before they can talk, let alone form coherent independent thought.

To question a person's Faith is to attack the very heart of their core belief system.  Such an action is a direct assault on a person's value as a human being.  It threatens their validity, the sanctity of all they hold true.
Questioning a person's Faith instills fear, and in doing such it suspends rational thought.

Not many people are comfortable being attacked and shaken at such a deep psychological level, nor are they able to willingly and acceptingly free themselves of such a deeply-rooted guiding post for their existance.
In fact, many people are willing to go through great suffering or even die (and some cases kill) for their Faith.
Thus made evident, it is clear that the easiest way to inflame passions or to create a unifying psychological front against an issue is to use the Faith of the people against it.

No group or society that claims to call itself 'civilized' is immune to this flaw of the human psyche.
Not even those who call themselves Atheist.

It is possible to have individuals who are comfortable enough with their position in the universe to be able to accept and analyze attacks on their Faith without ill effect.
It is possible to have a wide enough assortment of small groups of people of differing Faiths in the same general area wherein a directed assault on one will be countered by the opinions of the others.
However with a large enough pool of subjects, it is possible to sway public opinion, if not of an overwhelming majority, at least a vocal enough plurality, toward whatever the intended goal, irregardless of the true relevance toward the Faith-based assault.
It is all a matter of psychology."

Pure and simple.  I mean no offense to anyone, but if you feel that way, too bad, this is my opinion on the matter.
I know we're a society of laziness, but I'd at least hoped we had a majority consensus of desire for progress and accountability.  Apparently not quite.
Abortion
Gay Marriage
Fiscal Responsibility
International Relations
Religios Faith
Scientific Progress
Environmental Protection
Personal Attitude
Military Strategy

These appear to me to be the main issues behind the election, some for very good reasons, others not so.
Many other people will not share my view, but I do not care.  My life and my experiences are different from theirs.  I do not rely on religion to make my decisions for me, as so many people do.  I rely on my personal observations and concrete evidence to assist me in making my decisions.  It is my life to live, I will not have ANYONE to tell me how to live it.  PERIOD.  Not friends, not religious advisors (solicited or not, DEFINITELY not unsolicited), not family, and not politicians, ESPECIALLY not the president of this country.
There are many things I respect: honor, responsibility, integrity, creativity, intelligence, progress, accountability, simplicity, tranquility, cooperation, independence, forthrightness, and many others.
Things I do not respect are cowardice, untruthfulness, underhandedness, unequality, deceptiveness, inability to take accountability for one's own beliefs.
Now that you know my bias, on to the issues:
Abortion - this was decided a generation ago. Roe v. Wade.  Apparently the Supreme Court just isn't quite high enough authority for some people -- they must let their religion tell them otherwise.
Gay Marriage -- ""Land of the free...""  ""...unless you're black or gay or Cherokee...""
 -- once again, a 'higher authority' dictates many peoples prejudices, but with the added danger of homophobia thrown into the mix.  Several states individually have legislated against this, either tonight or previously, yet despite BOTH candidates opposition to allowing it, this issue was STILL used against the Democrats.
Fiscal Responsibility -- Moving from a HUGE surplus, to the LARGEST deficit in HISTORY, with no obvious plan to fix or even change course on this strategy, somehow doesn't raise enough of an alert to many people.  Mortgaging the financial future of the ENTIRE FUCKING COUNTRY on what appears to be a toss of the dice in Vegas doesn't strike me as a sound policy.
 -- When questioned about not ONCE vetoing a spending bill from the Legislative branch, while simultaneously slashing taxes, Bush showed his blatant, potentially fatal ignorance of the ""system of checks and balances.""  As the supreme authority of the Executive branch, the President is responsible for checking the actions of the Legislative branch, and maintaining balance.  His response of (to paraphrase) ""that just shows what you can do when you have cooperation between the House, Senate and President"" (implying that since both the House and Senate were Republican controlled, he as a Republican President didn't need to worry about what they were doing, as the Party would not steer him wrong)
International Relations -- worsening public opinions both internally and internationally about the American Public will not assist the military in the indiscriminate ""War on Terror""
Religious Faith -- Faith is important for some people, but not for all.  I respect Faith as a matter personal belief and guidance, but deplore it's abuse to be used as a crutch to allow the willful neglect of intelligent, individual thought.
Scientific Progress -- this is the true future, the only way our nation will advance and prosper.  We are rapidly approaching (if not already past) the point in history where we can continue to neglect the proper nurturing and encouragement of scientific progress if we are to remain viable as one of the top 10 countries in the world.  Selling scientific advancement off to the highest bidder in allowing corporations to provide the majority of the funding will only allow advancement in areas that can quickly turn a profit, and are NOT always in the best public interest, as opposed to the best bottom line.  We will continue to advance, but at a much slower, much less socially useful pace.  It's only a matter of time.
Environmental Protection -- the environment is important to me.  It's where I live.  I only have one world to live on, and I don't enjoy seeing it trashed.  I don't care if it's better for some megacorporation, or even some small business owner's bottom line, I want to have a safe world to live in, and maybe eventually raise a family in.  Please stop conspiring to trash or auction it off to the highest bidder.
Personal Attitude -- one candidate may have the personality of a waffle iron, the other of a college buddy.  Personally, I'd rather have the one who can look at more than one side of an issue, rather than one who ALWAYS acts with a cowboy bravado irregardless of the consequences.  Unfortunately apparently the majority of people would rather have the guy who would be more fun to have a beer with sitting in the most dangerous, responsible public job in the world.  That or the guy who claims religious guidance for many of his actions.  It's one thing to try to come across as a pious individual on some issues, if you follow up such an act with a life of religious integrity.  To put forth such an act on some issues, but act like an arrogant jackass on others, that does not lend itself toward maintaining that image (at least not to those of us who are not blinded by religion)
Military Strategy -- this is not my specialty, it is outside my area of experience, but it seems that controlled spending and controlled strategy should be important in this.  At least to me.  But then what do I know?  I'm not in the military, nor do I make their decisions.  I just pay for it in terms of taxes (or maybe not currently but I'm sure I will in the future when someone corrects the fiscal irresponsibility of the last four years, using MY and OUR futures as the world's largest credit card)

Watching the commentary this evening, the comment that this race basically came down to ""science versus religion"" stuck with me.  When the choice came down to a dangerous man who abuses faith to carry his message, vs. a less than inspiring individual who is more open to social and scientific progress, I do not feel comfortable with the way the nation has become divided twice in a row now.  It seems as if we are two nations divided by ideology.  The South and Central being more of a Faith-based, traditional nation, while the Northeast, Upper Midwest, and West Coast being more socially progressive and less fearful of change.
We supposedly hired a ""uniter, not a divider"" four years ago.  The nation is still divided along the same stereotypes.
Unfortunately, when people vote with their heart instead of their mind, for an individual running for a position requiring coherence and demonstrated intelligence rather than emotional action, it can be a very, VERY dangerous thing.

The time for change has come and gone, America.  I hope you're fucking happy.  Good luck surviving 4 more years of the same, I know I'm going to need it.  
Who will it be to salvage the pieces left over?  Clinton/Edwards?  At least there won't be an incumbant to go against at that time.

By now if you're still reading this, you can probably guess what way my vote went, but do not assume it paints my political affiliations.  Like my religious philosophy, while I respect the loyalty such things inspire, I prefer to think for myself, and choose the candidates whom I feel to be most qualified for the position to better our nation, or at very least best able to stem the damage that has already been done.

"event","What is it about some people that makes them the default authority about what other people should do with their money?  Once again I find myself on the recieving end of a financial lecture from my coworkers based on my personal financial decisions.
I don't think they are bad decisions, maybe not the ""ideal"" thing that I should be doing, but they are entirely within my means.
The whole lecture was inspired yet again by the voicing of my desire to buy a new car as opposed to buying an overpriced cramped townhouse or condo somewhere around here.
The whole ""you'll never make any money with a car"" arguement always irritates me.  I know damn well I won't be making money off of the car in a year or two, and I don't intend to.
I want a new car because I've never had a truly new car.  I will use the new car a lot.  I don't absolutely need a new car, but I would appreciate one.
I wouldn't mind having a home to call my own, but I do not feel the need to be tied down to any one location just yet either.
I have neither need nor desire to 'settle down' and fix myself in a specific location for untold years to come, waiting for my property to appreciate in value to make me money.  That's not who I am.
If I had a reason to settle down, I would consider it, but given the negatives (very expensive housing market that shows little signs of letting up, high up-front costs, boatloads of paperwork and legal matters to deal with) I think I'd get more personal appreciation out of a vehicle.
Plus most houses cannot be driven, and given the lack of people I know who are willing to visit me, how else am I going to show off?
I always seem to have people telling me that 'it's best to put your money in something so you can get it back rather than tossing it away on rent.'
What I pay in rent per month is less than 1/6 of my take-home pay (post-taxes), and it gives me a place to sleep at night and a location to store all of my stuff.  That's what I want and expect out of rent.
I don't care if putting 2.5x as much into a mortgage every month will let me recoup 60% of my total investment at some later date.  I know I'm not getting my money back, but I'm also not shelling out nearly as much to begin with (not to mention taxes and other fees associated with ownership around here).
I have an arrangement with my current roommate to move in with him to his new place and pay him rent.  My costs will be nearly identical to what they are now in our apartment, plus I will be getting space in his garage for my car.
I'm giving up a little bit of interior space in his townhouse (vs. our apartment) plus having a longer commute to work, but I know what my costs are, it's a nicer neighborhood, I am still somewhat mobile (if the need arises), and I'm helping him out with what he wants to do.
There are many intangibles involved with making the decision to settle down, many of which do not weigh heavily enough for me to consider it seriously at this point in my life.
I have never been one to settle into any particular spot for too long.  The one exception was when my parents lived in the same house when I went from 2nd through 10th grades.  But even then I was changing schools every few years (elementary, middle, high).  Since then, about every 2 years it seems there has been some other change, either school, work or home.
I guess it's part of that restless nature of mine.  I have no real reason to limit myself to any particular location, so why bother doing so?  So I can recoup part of my investment (all the while paying through the nose for taxes/interest/association fees/etc.)?
No thanks, I'd rather keep my options open.  If it means I'm not getting any monetary gratification for my incurred rental expenses, then so be it.  So long as I can keep those expenses to a minimal amount, it does not bother me, and I think I should be free to do what I feel like with my extra cash.
Oddly enough, I don't think I'd have gotten the same lecture if they heard how much money I've had sitting around in savings earning 0.5-1% interest per year, but once it comes out that money will be spent on a losing proposition such as the baddest car out there, the 'experts' find it necessary to voice their opinion.
In the end, it always seems to end the same way, with the condescending/disappointed ""After all, it is your money"" response from the 'experts'.  To which I agree.  It is my money, and I want it to do something for me that *I* want.
Surprisingly, I don't get the same lectures from my parents as I do from my colleagues who recently find themselves playing the mortgage game.  I guess so long as my folks know that I am fully capable of making my ends meet, it doesn't seem to matter as much to them.


update: the above was written a week ago, just not put into my journal until now (I'm a slacker, deal with it).
On an amusing sidenote to the above, nowadays when I hear my home-owning coworkers complaining about being on such a tight budget that they can't afford to go anywhere for vacations so they can sit at home and pay off the interest/taxes/fees/etc. they're now shackled to, I smile ever so slightly inside, and think of all the places I can afford to go, and that someday I just might get there..."

I am not Japanese, nor do I pretend to be.
I am fascinated by their culture and history, but I do not let it become an obsession.
I like to think I understand just a tiny bit more than many of the average people I encounter, though I am humbly reminded that there is yet so much about the subject to which I remain ignorant.  Every little bit I learn informs me of the vast wealth of unknowable knowledge that I will never truly comprehend.  To paraphrase the famous quote (which I cannot immediately recall) ""the more I know, the more I know I don't know"".
This is true of any subject, and for someone who is so truly American in culture as I, it is all the more painfully obvious.
While re-watching ""The Last Samurai"" this evening, the line ""...from sunrise to sunset they dedicate their lives to making whatever thing they set out to do perfect..."" reminded me of that aspect of Japanese mentality (I know my quoting is horribly prone to inexactness, but I hope you get the idea).  To an outsider such as myself, that is one stereotype that sets them apart from my own culture and life (I call it a stereotype as I cannot verify it's accuracy, only that it appears to be true of at least some portion of the population).
It is also a reminder about how very different I am from such a culture, and why I strive to keep my fascination from turning into an obsession.  I know I could never fit in, to leave my home here behind and become one with Japan.  I have too short of an attention span and am far too easily distracted to ever truly specialize in any one particular thing.  It is not my nature, not my drive to dedicate my life to any specific task.  I know that doing such can often lead to great works in some subjects, but life has too much to offer, too much to sample for me to willingly pass certain portions of it by.  I lament that I could never do everything that life has to offer if I lived a hundred lifetimes, but I am thankful that the Earth has enough to offer such endless bounty of treasure and experience to all of her inhabitants.
I may never know true greatness in any one thing, but I draw comfort in that I know to be able to look for greatness in the diversity this vast world has to offer."

Once again the thoughts of the open road reach into my mind, more of the journey rather than the destination.  The thrill of the pursuit, the hunt, the striving for the goal, irregardless of what or where the goal itself is.
Such is the metaphor for my life.  I dont' really know where I'm going, but I'm haging on for the ride wherever it takes me.
Over the past few years I've seen many friends and coworkers buying houses, getting married, having kids, yet I steadfastly refuse, haging on to my stubborn restlessness. (I've been saving my money for a new car instead if that tells you anything.  Fortunately my current roommate is buying a place with a 2-car garage and invited me to rent from him, so I'll have somewhere to park it)
Constantly on the move, never settling, always in search of the perfect place that probably doesn't exist.  I dream of the day when I can just hop in the car and go, not look back, just take off and keep on going until I run out of road.  But alas I cannot do that yet, I need to keep coming back here.

I'm just hoping he can figure things out and straighten her up before he finds himself in too deep of trouble, especially with her adding a couple extra tickets to his already suffering traffic record (while he was off with me visiting his family).

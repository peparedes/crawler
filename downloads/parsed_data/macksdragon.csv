Your soul is bound to the <b>White Rose</b>: The<br>Pure.

<i>""I've been waiting in the dark for a long<br>time, shining my beacon of hope through the<br>shadow.  If you see me, don't you hide your<br>eyes from me.""</i>

The White Rose is associated with purity, honor,<br>and chastity.  It is governed by the goddess<br>Artemis and its sign is The Cross, or Agape.

As a White Rose, you are a person of your word.<br>You may have a strong moral code, but<br>regardless of your virtue, you always stay true<br>to yourself.  To you, love is the most pure of<br>emotional forms and it's just a matter of<br>waiting for it to bless you.  Some people may<br>say you are too idealistic, but it's only<br>because you don't want to mess things up.

You are very friendly<br>and nice, but when somebody you don't know<br>comes to talk to you, you are very shy and so<br>scared you won't run away.

Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek)<br>and Isis (Egyptian).
The Vampire is associated with the concept of<br>death, the number 9, and the element of fire.
Her sign is the eclipsed moon.

As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic<br>individual.  You may be a little idealistic,<br>but you are very grounded and down to earth.<br>You realize that not everything lasts, but you<br>savor every minute of the good times.  While<br>you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you<br>have strong ties with people that will never be<br>broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have<br>because they are sensible.

You are Form 6, Elfin: The Wyld. ""And The Elfin saw the evil and misjudgement in the world and shot her arrow at the sky. Bolts of lightning struck the earth and gave the world balance and growth."" Some examples of the Elfin Form are Demeter (Greek) and Khepry (Egyptian). The Elfin is associated with the concept of growth and balance, the number 6, and the element of water. Her sign is the half moon. As a member of Form 6, you are a very balanced individual. You can easily adapt to most situations and you may be a good social chameleon.

<lj-cut text=""Love, Sex, and Arcadia"">Love, Sex, and Arcadia
   
Dragons and sex.  Fights and unicorns.  Happy lives and sad endings.  Mad love and total hatred.  There's only one place where these things collide.  Arcadia.
   
Arcadia is known for having the wildest parties and the kinkiest clubs.  The perfect scenery and the cleanest streets.  But there's more to Arcadia than meets the eye.  It's the love and the hatred that tears at the core of the city.  Tears it apart.  After only being a lost city for fifty years, the current residents run off leaving it more of a lost city, a dead city, except for the dragons and the other mystical creatures that took up resident there.  

Dragon infested and buildings in ruin is mostly what's left of Arcadia.  It's something not one person would want to find because of the stories told about dragons.  About how they can be so vicious, yet nobody has actually come in contact with one in years.  The stories say that a single dragon could rip a man to pieces in only five seconds.  That they can con you into doing anything for them only to be eaten in return.  

Curiosity.  Never really a good thing.  Especially when new residents to the stories are wanting to find the lost city.  A couple actually thought about going to seek it out.  They were talked out of it by some people, talked back in to going by others.  Their final destination, after being conned in and out of going, was to be Arcadia.

This curious couple, each only fifteen, set off on their journey not knowing what they will find.  Along the way and at their destination.  They set off with food, water, clothes, and a map that a used to be a resident of Arcadia many years ago, gave them.  Their journey starts at DragonTown.  Funny name for a town that hasn't seen dragons in hundreds of years.  The map they carry is small and the distance between the two cities looks quite short, but appearances can be deceiving.  

""Why are we doing this again?"" asks Mack, the boyfriend.  ""I mean, do we really want to be face to face with a dragon?""

Amber (the girlfriend) looks at him awkwardly.  ""You wanted to go too, you know,"" she states as she curls up next to him under the stars and the shimmering moon.  

""I know, but I don't know,"" he says as he wraps his arms tightly around his love.  She just nuzzles her face against his chest and closes her eyes, falling fast asleep.  Mack leans back, with Amber still tightly in his grip, and falls into a dream filled sleep.  

A dream filled sleep doesn't always mean the dreams are good.  For Mack is rudely awakened by an awful nightmare of vicious dragons and boiling fires.  Amber, awakened by his startled jump eagerly asks, ""Babe, what's wrong?"" He looks at Amber with frightened eyes and try's to catch his breath.  Gently touching her fingertips to his cheek, ""What happened?"" she asks softly, pulling him to her.  Quickly, he wraps his arms tight around her and presses his tear-filled eyes to her shoulder.  Soothingly, ""It was only a dream, it'll be okay.""  

""But you got burned by a dragon, then eaten alive.  I could hear your screams.  It felt so real.  I could feel the heat of the flames,"" he stammered.  She stroked his tearstained cheeks with her knuckles.

""It was just a dream, love.  It was only a dream.""

""But it felt so real.""  He stared at the disturbed ground as she took him back into her arms.  Amber held his shivering, sweat-covered body close to hers, calming him with every breath he took.  Soon, he was sleeping calmly in her arms, only leaving her in tears.  Tears of fear, because she didn't know what kind of hideous dragons they were to run in to.  She ended up crying herself to sleep as well.  

Morning came quickly.  They were woken by the brightly shining sun, blaring at their faces.  The first words of the morning were full of sweet-nothings, for the nightmare frightened them both to tears.  There were hugs and kisses in between cooking breakfast, folding and putting the blankets in their packs, and their plan of action for the day.  

The journey for the day, was getting to the nearest city.  The map said it was about thirteen miles away.  Zefan, was the name of the town they were to travel to.  They thought they could make it in a day because it was only thirteen miles, that's what the map said anyway.  But appearances are never as they seem.  They walked from dawn to dusk and Zefan was no where in site.  It was frustrating.  Only thirteen miles is what the map said.  Had they taken a wrong turn?  No, because all the landmarks that were on the map were staring them in the face.  Frustrated and tired they decided to make camp.  With a warm little fire and untrusting gray clouds floating above them.  

Rain starts pouring out of the dark, heavy clouds.  The fire slowly sizzles to coals.  They awake, drenched from the rain.  Looking at each other, cold and tired, exhausted and frustrated.  Amber heard the wind whisper, ""Trust me.""  She quickly remembered the dream she had had before awaking.  After crawling over to him, she touched her fingertips to his cheek and looked him over a few times.  Her eyes hungry for something more than he'd ever given her.  Hungry for him, for his body.  As she licked the rain off her lips, he pressed a passionate kiss on to her lips.  They let their tongues play, for it had been awhile since they really kissed each other with meaning.  

Their clothes no longer stuck to their bodies, but sprawled about their campsite.  Amber's breathing getting deeper and more uneven every time he went in.  Mack starts to move his hips a little faster and Amber lets a little cry, he wasn't sure if it was of pain or pleasure so he eased some.  She sucks in a gasp of air and lets it out in uneven exhales.  Lightly, she touches the tip of tongue briefly to his neck, then pushes her hips up as he enters her.  A cry is released from both of them, Amber's a little louder than Mack's.  Her hips fall back to the ground.  She takes shallow breaths, her chest rising uneven as her lungs are half filled with air.  For a short moment he rests his forehead against her chest, then he lets his lips gently lay a kiss against her skin.  Even breaths now flood her lungs.  He starts his rhythm again, slower and a little harder than before.  Immediately, the deep, uneven breaths return.  Amber slightly arches her back, only to slowly lower it back to the wet muddy ground.  Mack slows and exits Amber's body, he lays against her rain and sweat covered body.  Softly and gently, he presses his lips to hers, then lays his head on her chest.  Slowly, their heartbeats return to normal and they drift into a perfect sleep.

Amber's eyes slowly creep open.  Confused as to her whereabouts, she looks around.  Wrapped in a black satin sheet in a gothic tower, she swore she was dreaming.  Mack sleeping soundly, wrapped in the same sheet, rolled into Amber's body.  She looked at him and smiled.  Feeling his warmth and his touch, she knew she wasn't dreaming.  Grabbing a blanket from the floor and wrapping it around her naked body, she walks over to the window.  Outside, people are happy and chatting, but the buildings are tall and dark.  ""Could this be Zefan?"" she whispered to herself.  ""Was my dream really true?""  

Mack finally awakes, quite confused himself, sees Amber looking out the window and wraps the black satin sheet around his waist.  He places his hands on her hips, startling her.  ""Sorry.  Where are we?"" he says as he kisses her neck.  

""I think we're in Zefan.""

""So, it does exist?  But how?  I mean...how'd we end up here, when just last night we were making love on a muddy ground?""  

""There's,"" she pauses, ""something I didn't tell you.""  She's given a funny look.  ""I had a dream before we woke up to the rain.""  He becomes even more confused, ""It was a dream about how to actually get to here.  To Zefan.""  

""What are you talking about?""

Tears creep into her eyes, ""I -""  A single tear slides down her cheek and is wiped away by Mack's thumb.  

""Sweetie?""

She presses her face to his bare chest, ""I'm sorry.""  He holds her tight.  ""Mack, the dream, it told me how to get here.  It was strange.""  He still wasn't understanding why Amber was crying or how they got there.  ""It was the reason we, uh..""

""What?"" he asked in disbelief, pushing her away to arms length, hands on her shoulders.  ""So, you're saying that we had sex to get to this kinky little town, is that it?""  Anger was rising inside of him.  Amber collapsed to a sitting position on the floor, tears now pouring down her face.  ""Did it mean anything to you?  Or was it just so that you could have a bed to sleep in, or a fire to sit in front of without it going out?  Or was it so you could be pampered?""  She looked up at him, ashamed of herself and hurt because of what he had said.  Mack walks over to the bed, pulls on his boxers and tosses the sheet onto the bed.  He finishes getting dressed, walks over to the door, opens it, and starts to walk through.

""I forgot about the dream,"" she said with a voice barely there.  Mack stopped in the threshold, ""Once I felt your touch, your warmth, it just vanished from my thoughts.""  She took a deep breath and looked at him with sad, depressed eyes.  He turned and looked at her for a moment, then turned back around and left to explore the town.  Her whole body fell to the hardwood floor, her body shook as she cried.  Eventually, she cried herself to sleep.

Mack walked through crowds of happy chattering people, but as he walked through them they seemed to sense his sadness and anger.  For they stopped him as he reached the center of the crowd.  ""What?"" he said a little aggravated.

""We know your troubles,"" an old lady said in a slight English accent.  ""We know them very well.""  Mack gave her a strange look, so she explained, ""We can see what you see.  We can hear what you hear.  We know your every thought.  We know you are quite angry with your Amber.""

""How'd you know her name?""

""We know.""  </lj-cut>"

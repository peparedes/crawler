"event","It's interesting how many things  sometimes change in a short time.  Some are good, some not so good, and some with the potential to be good.    

<b>Potential to be good:</b>  As posted earlier, I quit at Jo Ann back in November.  I don't miss it this time (last time, there were days that I vaguely missed it while working at the office.)  I see posts from people who still work there and think ""I'm so glad I don't have to sort the truck, set the ad, deal with the crowds, set the new seasonal stuff etc.""  But, it's funny that when I was window shopping for jobs on Indeed around mid-February, the posting for my old job was still up.  

<b>Good:</b>  Physical health is better.  Mental health is leaning toward better.  I'm slowly regaining parts of my soul that were stripped away by the way we were treated there.  While working there, I'd fallen pretty deep into the ""What's the point?  Nothing is worth this.  I don't so much want to kill myself as just not live anymore."" pit.  It's a horrible downward spiral because I kept trying to set reasons to keep doing the crap that was killing my soul and for a while, it worked.  Then it worked less and less until I'd think of some reason to keep going and the resistance to doing soul crushing things made me just not want the desirable outcome anymore.  Plus, since hours were cut because the company didn't want to provide health care insurance, nothing was affordable anymore.  So, many desirable things were put completely into the unreachable zone, including healthcare (since our dick of a governor didn't expand Medicaid like he should have.)  I think the last straw for me was when Christmas came around and they said ""oh you can work more hours while we need you but you'll have to take some time off later so you still average under the amount required for insurance assistance.""  Ass.  No No No.  I can't be on call 24/7 for shit pay and no benefits - pay so shitty that I can't afford rent and Ramen noodles, forget a car or phone or actual food.  I can't gain a few extra dollars this week because you need me but lose a whole week's pay later because you want to be a greedy douche.  Eh hem.  Now back to your regularly scheduled LJ post.  (I get this feeling that I needed to identify as a villain for a while so I could get away from toxic things in life and allow myself to identify as a coward in some ways and to feel negative things so I could figure out what they were.  Now I seem to be leaning more toward a form of justice/heroics by addressing those evil things and trying to rebuild.)   

<b>Potential to be good:</b>  For a little while, shortly after I quit, the ability to want/like things started to come back.  It was enough that I managed to fight every fiber of my being's resistance against calling for driving lessons.  Now it's a roller coaster of emotional ups and downs.  Sometimes I feel pretty good for doing a thing some people will never feel the need to do - facing their worst fear and incorporating it into everyday life in more than one category.  Driving + social anxiety.  Other times, I get this horrible feeling that I simply can't imagine myself driving and going out into random public places that I'm not used to where there are people I don't know.    

I've had about six lessons now and while I've definitely learned from them, I still don't feel comfortable.  So, there's still waffling between the idea of finally being able to drive myself to do the many thing's I'd like to do and not wanting to do them anymore because anxiety :P.  

<b>Good/Potential to be good: </b> I did update my resume and have contacted people about being references for me and now have a completed, functioning list.  I've applied for an office job but am sort of just waiting out a thing I'll address in bit.  

<b>Good:</b>  I have been on some Chinese medicine for anxiety that is helping to contain it a bit.  I didn't even realize I had it so badly until the medicine started to kick in and it eased up some.  I guess you just get used to living with it and stop noticing how horribly uncomfortable it is until it eases up.  Even so, I've had bouts of dizziness and loss of focus or rather, brain fog that's associated with anxiety.  

<b>Not so Good/Sad/but there is a bright side:</b>  It could be many things causing that besides trying to drive.  It could be that I don't have a new job lined up yet.  But while there is pressure to have an income, the timing on this is actually not bad.  Our cat, Boot, has been in bad shape.  We're surprised he's still with us.  He isn't ready to give in emotionally and mentally but his body is failing him.  But, he's got to be about 21 years old.  As a coworker once noted to another coworker ""her cat is older than you are!""  He's had a good life and has been happy with us.  It's a much better life than so many cats have.  With not working, I can be here to spend time with him and take care of him (many nights of little to no sleep which is not so much because of taking care of him but because of the personal need to get up and check on him every few minutes).  Plus, it's emotionally draining so at least I'm not having to plaster on a fake smile at work and worry about things there on top of this.

<b>Good:</b>  Also in random news, a leak in the roof over the bathroom was being a cause for stress for a while.  We were told the roofers could come within three weeks to fix it but that's a long time away in one of the rainiest winters we've had in a long time.  And of course, there's the worry of cost.  But, thankfully they came today and the cost is less than half of what we were thinking it might be.  So yay.  Leak taken care of.  Now I just need to paint some Kilz over the stains.  

<b>Good:</b>  Speaking of painting, I also finally finished painting my room and made a nice little office/crafting nook.  It's nice to work and not look at the bed wondering why I'm suddenly so tired.  The weirdest part is that even though it takes up more space this way, it looks like it takes less.  And there's a mini-wall between the bed and the windows now so I get less light from the streetlights at night.  (Because there's a palm tree that wafts in front of one of them and it ends up looking like a strobe light on windy nights >_<)  

<b>Not so good but working on better:</b>  I was doing pretty well with having a daily schedule of writing and art practice for a little bit but when I started the driving lessons and when Boot's health went down hill, I lost the focus to be able to work on it.  I've been mostly working on a craft thingy for the house and playing games that require just enough thought to clear my head but not so much that it becomes a new thought.  Pocket Pond, Minion Rush, and the My Little Pony games have been good for that.  I was surprised at the last one actually.  It's ridiculously addictive - a cute sandbox style game with goals to work on whenever you feel like it.  It's also a positively charged game with the idea of restoring beauty and building things rather than fighting or destroying so it has a nice zen quality.  Maybe games like these will help keep things clear so productive thoughts can return. 

<b>Difficult but potential for good: </b> Speaking of games, I dug out and played a bit of some games I used to play with Mike, Mel, and Erik.  Best friendship turned toxic, close friendship gone bad then friend died, and friendship turned relationship turned break-up...  It's been a way of sort of clearing out the lingering negativity from the break-ups and trying to remember the good times without wanting to cry.  Erik is also getting married now which is oddly comforting - knowing that he found happiness.  

And that's all I can think of for right now.  Stuff and things and things and stuff..."

Dear United States of America... oh...  I'm sorry, your street name is Corporate America now isn't it?,

I admit that over the years, I've said some pretty horrible things about you.  But it's all been in the name of tough love.  After all, we both have to admit that you have a ridiculous amount of bad habits, fail to prioritize things well, and treat others horribly.  If your ancestors or forefathers knew what you were doing today, they would probably strangle you to death with their bare hands.  It would be enabling of me if I failed to point out your tendency to bully 99% of your own population (not to mention the populations of several other countries as well) and transfer jobs you should be doing to other countries like China or India.  Bully people enough one of them just might get angry and try to kill you.  And we all know that passing a job you should be doing along to someone else will hurt only you in the end.  You lose valuable experience and eventually what you see as ""easy money"" loses value as it trickles into the pockets of industrious countries leaving you homeless, broke, and depressed.  

I am also sorry for pointing out that the other countries are making fun of you.  It seems important that you know that you have become the laughing stock of the world.  If you didn't hear this from someone, you would never have the insight to change.  After all, even with all of your faults, there are people trying to help you by collecting in large groups to inform you of the problems and give ideas for solutions.  If that isn't an act of true love and compassion, then I don't know what is.  Yes there is frustration in our hearts, but we didn't get up and desert you.  However, in return you have ignored us and even called the police on us.  That top 1% doesn't really love you!  It feels like they do but they're playing a psychological trick on you!  They act like they think you're so great and wonderful and say they love you but if they really did, would they be supporting policies and people who are going to cause your downfall?  It's like you have an abusive boyfriend but refuse to see it and leave him!  Please listen to those who really care about you and your future!    We don't want to have to say ""I told you so"".  It would be nice to be able to call you the United States again instead of Corporate America.

Sincerely,

Most people won't like my answer...  If you think you won't like it and chose to read it anyway, don't yell at me.  I warned you.

<lj-cut text=""cut"">

First off, to answer the question, I was getting ready for class.  (college at the time)  I had to take a math test with all of this fresh in my mind.  Then they decided to close the gate after the cows had already escaped.  Everything closed down late in the day...  you know...  after several hours of the possibility of more attacks.    

I'm tired of seeing the footage from this day.  It's mental/psychological torture.  Not to mention brainwashing.  Stay angry everyone!!!  Remember why we have troops out there!  I feel so horrible for survivors and family of those lost who have to be reminded so often of the pain of this day.  Can't we just have a quiet memorial where the people's lives are remembered without the destructive footage?  Well I'm not supporting it.  I'm not watching the news.  I'll take a moment of silence to remember those lives in my own way.  And to add to this, I'm still waiting for the day when they truly honor those lives by telling us the truth about what happened that day.  (Which probably never will happen.)  I don't claim to know what the truth is but there is so much more to this than we're being told.  There are too many holes in the ""story"" and it is a dishonor to the lives lost to continue this lie.

Anyway, I'm not saying we should forget.  I just think we should leave the violence and pain in the past, remember those lost for what they did in their lives and continue any good deeds they may have started before that day."

It's impossible to choose just one!  It depends on what day it is or what my mood is.

Right now, I'll go with Innuendo.  There are so many great and powerful messages in that song and the song itself is so unique.    

Top favs in no particular order are:

'39 
The Prophet's Song
Liar
See What a Fool I've Been
White Queen
She Makes Me
Death on Two Legs
Drowse
Spread Your Wings
Who Needs You
My Melancholy Blues
Don't Stop Me Now
Radio Ga Ga
I Want To Break Free
Don't Lose Your Head
I'm Going Slightly Mad
Don't Try So Hard
Ride The Wild Wind
It's A Beautiful Day
And Does Barcelona count?  Well I'm counting it ;).  

And yes, thanks to Queen I have watched Flash Gordon more times than I'd like to admit to.  (It had really great costumes too though!  Holy bead-work Batman!)"

I would say no because I get to talk to long distance friends on line...  but with $10 million I'd just go visit everyone in person and pay for their flights to come visit here (or where ever they/we want to be)!  It would be an amazing life of adventure, experience, and actual real life time spent with awesome people!  As for sharing all of that fun, photos travel well on thumb drives these days and nothing says I can't still use a computer that isn't connected to the internet to look at photos in person with everyone.  So yeah...  Internet, I <3 you...  but the ability to have real life meetings with everyone you bring closer together is still worth more."

Well, I suppose more adult involvement in children's lives would be the answer.  And I don't mean to leave it up to the teachers either.  I mean family and everyone else involved in raising a child including influences of society and friends.  Yes teachers can help in the support system but they aren't baby sitters/nannies.  It's up to the family to talk to their kids about proper treatment of other human beings and to set a good example.  It doesn't work to tell your child one thing then do another.  It's also up to the family to talk about the consequences of such actions.  Peers can frown upon bullies' actions making it less attractive to be a bully.  Also, when a child sticks up for himself/herself to a bully, don't punish them.  None of this ""I don't care who started it"" stuff.  Be observant.  If you see that a child clearly had to do something to defend his/her self, do something about the source of the issue, not the resulting effect."

Well it's better than it was with voting rights and ability to have a career.  The only problem is that women are now EXPECTED to work AND take care of the house AND take care of the kids.  Society still looks down on a woman who does not get married and make babies no matter how great a career she may have.  Yet they'll also look down on her if she chooses to be a wife/mother only.  There are far too many women trying to juggle all 3 and some with college or other classes on top of that.  I wonder if we should add the average lower pay rates for women to that equation too?  It would be nice if both men and women had the option to be a stay at home parent.  There should be nothing wrong with either gender taking that role.  Which brings up the idea of how a man is supposed to act according to society.  He is still EXPECTED to work, do the heavy lifting, never show any kind of ""feelings"", and so on.  If he's better with the kids and house work then there should be nothing wrong with that idea.  Or if he has a liking of the arts etc., it doesn't make him gay.  (I've had many completely straight guy friends who appreciate art/a good book/great music/stage shows/are comfortable with sharing their feelings/even dressing in women's clothing etc.)  And on top of that, there should be no negative connotation to being gay!  So no.  There will always be inequality as long as there is ignorance, fear, misunderstanding, and people who feel like they have to do/say something to make themselves look better than someone else."

Private room karaoke only!  And with a group of (drunk) people, you'd be surprised at how much fun ""Sweet Caroline"" is.  Everyone sings along in ridiculous but awesome ways.  Piano Man is always good though.  Pretty much any guilty pleasure song works well.  Everyone knows them, likes them, and will sing along with a little beer to help."

I can't pick just one~  but darn it I've always loved Queen and everyone used to either say ""who the heck are they?"" or just make fun of me for not liking the same stuff as everyone else.  Now I keep seeing things like the title line of this, commercials, songs in movies etc.  Suddenly they're everywhere which I love for them but kinda makes me wonder why people who used to make fun of me for liking them now like them! Grr...  It always happens.  It happened with anime too.  ""Why do you watch that crap?"" 10 years later... ""Hey I'm going to a convention this weekend...""  Well Part of me hopes the trend keeps up because I'd love to see FAKE?, Oblivion Dust, L'Arc, and VAMPS getting more love.  I just hope that all of this comes out of an actual love of the music/art and not just because things suddenly become popular.  (Although I know popularity is what drives things like this.)"

I usually kind of make things up when cooking but this is one I'd like to be able to recreate.

1 cup chopped carrots
1/2 of an onion chopped
1 tablespoon butter
1 lb beef
1 hot cup water
1 beef bullion cube
red cooking wine
basil
3-4 bay leaves
1/2 tablespoon bisto
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
mashed potatoes (either home made or store bought)
paprika
sharp chedder shredded cheese

1.  Brown carrots and onion in butter on high heat.

2.  Add ground beef.  Break up into small pieces and brown.

3.  Add a splash of red wine.

4.  Break up bullion cube in cup of hot water.  Add to mixture and reduce heat to low.

5.  Add Basil and stir.

6.  Lay bay leaves on top of mixure.

7.  Cover and let cook on low for 20-30 min.

8.  Remove bay leaves.  Mix cornstarch with bisto and about 1 tablespoon cold water.  Add to beef mixture and stir well.

9.  Pour mixture into a baking pan.  Spread mashed potato on top.

10.  Sprinkle paprika and shredded sharp chedder over potato.

11.  Bake at 400 fahrenheit for 20-30 minutes until cheese/potato browns on top.

12.  Once removed from oven, let sit for about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with parsely if desired.

If anyone is wondering, Bisto is a British product used to thicken and flavor broth or to make gravy."

In the way of teaching students how to excercise and take care of their physical health, yes.  The class I had in high school was pretty good actually.  They taught us different exerises, weight lifting, and there was 1 day a week of class room work where we actually studied the importance of physical health and the hows and whys to taking care of it.  Once they taught us how to do everything, what we did was pretty optional.  It was like ""pick and activity and do it.  Whichever you like best.""  I liked walking so did that quite often and it was nice.  Some others liked to toss a ball around and some liked the weight lifting.  I don't think competitive team sports should be forced on students since some will be turned off of physical activity because of it.  Everyone has some sort of physical activity that suits them.  They just need to find what it is without being forced to do what it isn't."

Well I don't think we really need a special day to tell each other that we care.  We should be able to do it every or any day.  But I still wouldn't eliminate V-day just because there are some people who seem to enjoy it.  So Happy Valentine to those who enjoy it.  Happy Singles Awareness Day to those who are celebrating being happily single.  Or Have a good day to those who would rather it just be another day ;)."

I can't choose just one!  I used to love Tex Avery cartoons.  But there was also Rocky and Bullwinkle (I really loved the fractured fairy tales), Wait til Your Father Gets Home, The Noozles, David the Gnome, Little Koalas, Pink Panther, Tale Spin, Darkwing Duck, Smurfs (shut up, I was only about 3 years old *^_^* and while we're talking really young, I'll add the original My Little Ponies.)  Some of the Merry Melodies and Silly symphonies were really good too.  Who could not love Daffy Duck in ""Duck Amuck""?  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrse3WqmNv4"">""Duck Amuck?""</a>   And of course the Bugs Bunny cartoon ""What's Opera Doc?""?  OH!  And Duck Dodgers!  And even though I was a little older when this came out, I have to add Rocko's Modern Life.  And at even a bit older, Ed, Edd, and Eddy :) and getting more into the late teens, Courage the Cowardly Dog.  (Which turned out to be quite a surprise!  I loved the pilot but didn't quite see how they could get a full cartoon series out of the concept.  Well, they pulled it off beautifully!)  This doesn't even include animated movies or comics.  The list would just be way too long then!"

Overcome racism?  It's a beautiful dream isn't it?  But society will always have stubborn ignorance.  As long as there is poor or misguiding education or outright brain washing, there will be racism too.  Stereotypes don't help either.  It's human nature to be afraid of something differrent or to consider it below oneself.  ""you're different so it's YOU who's weird not me!""  It's just natural thought.  And negative stereotypes put our defenses up.  The only way to break that pattern is through education.  The problem is that one's mind has to be open to that eduation.  Some are so set in their ways that trying to educate them just makes the educator look ""wrong"" in their eyes.  One may as well be throwing books at a wall.  It'll never so much as look at them, they'll just bounce off of it.  One also has to see that a positive or negative stereotype doesn't apply to an entire population.  Every population has good and evil."

Any job where you have to clean up after people.  This includes everything from janitorial work to food service, retail, or hospitality.  People are worse than pigs especially when they know someone else is going to have to clean up after them.  What makes these jobs suck even worse is the pay.  You have to clean up some kids vomit for minimum wage.  

What I find truly sad is that I work with some extremely talented people - people who can sew gorgeous garments, paint amazing images, knit or crochet anything, or build beautiful furniture.  Yet they're stuck working retail because why would someone pay a little more for a quality product made locally when you could just buy some lead or pesticide filled piece of crap made in China at the dollar store?        

Humans all have a purpose in life.  In the current US society there is no place for those of us who were meant to make every day things.  Pottery, baskets, clothing, hats, shoes, pots, toys etc were all made by local skilled workers at one time.  Now all of those jobs no longer exist here so the people who are best suited to work at those jobs feel lost and talent ends up being wasted because they're forced to take whatever job they can find in this current economy."

Enough greed already!  It seems this message is spreading but not to those who really need to put it into action...  The politicians...  If they took a pay cut instead of a raise maybe they could stop cutting people lower on the ladder.  But The interesting thing is that if enough people are cut from the bottom of the pyramid, eventually it will come crashing down."

"event","This summer has had some of the oddest sunsets!&nbsp; It's like the air itself turns pink, orange, yellow, blue, or purple.&nbsp; The only way to somewhat describe it is to say &quot;It's very&nbsp;orange outside.&quot; (or whatever color it happens to be.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight was one of the most vivid.&nbsp; At our house, the front yard was yellow and orange and the back was purple and even turned red near the end of the sunset.&nbsp; It's most likely because of the high humidity reflecting the color that&nbsp;makes&nbsp;it feel like&nbsp;we're walking in pure color.&nbsp; But these nights also feel very eerie.&nbsp; It feels rather like a hurricane or tropical storm is near complete with goosebumps.&nbsp; (granted it usually turns more of a shade of green when a bad storm is near.)&nbsp; Tonight's was again, especially odd since it was a little cooler outside than normal.&nbsp; I'm sure the reason for the odd color at our house tonight is because the house faces west causing the orange and yellow light of the sun to reflect out front while the back is mostly shaded from the evening sun.&nbsp; I'm sure the purple in the backyard was just the humidity picking up the only light it could~ the light from the very purple clouds&nbsp; forming overhead and to the east.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Walmart.  I think that's self-explanitory.

I would say BP but there's no way to actually boycott them since we are sadly forced to use gasoline and oil for our every day lives since clean fuel is not yet available to everyone. Oil products could be coming from anywhere no matter what gas station you use.  It's not like BP only supplies oil to the stations that carry their name.  It's actually sold to a refinery and mixed with oil from other companies.  So the only way to truly boycott them is to walk or ride a bicycle everywhere and use only solar, wind, or water power in your home.  And while you're at it, you also have to stop use of <a href=""http://www.ranken-energy.com/Products from Petroleum.htm"">this list of products.</a>  And you'd also have to somehow boycott the government's use of the product.  Even the simple act of going to work every day supports them.  That is just an example of how bad the world is today.  The fact that they have so much power and have dug their claws so deeply into every day life that we as citizens don't have the ability to make a difference through a boycott."

Ah dreaming big again with this one ^^!  I would ask them to help me take over the world to create the utopia that man has dreamed of throughout recorded history.  This utopia would be a world of several ideas of utopia.  Different regions would have different forms of lifestyles with the ability to move between them as desired.  If someone doesn't like an area's form of utopia but prefers one in a different area, then he or she would be free to make the change.  The common theme would be reduction of greed and improvements in progress, respect, and productivity.  Not communism, not socialism, not capitalism~ instead a world based on the ideals of capitalism (a free market where anyone can open a business and can take on any career choice) but with higher minimum wage and caps on inflated CEO salaries (in other words, any overflow in CEO salary must be either put back into progress of the company or paid to employees as bonuses and this includes factory employees who should be treated as human beings, paid fairly including benefits, and able to work in a resonable environment.  NO MORE SWEAT SHOPS!) and a higher standard for respectable business ethics.  Hopefully this would include businesses understanding that they are in business to serve a need in the community~ to serve a customer with a quality product or service and recieve fair payment for it; Not swindle a customer out of their money or over charge for a low quality product.  I haven't even touched the idea of government employees...  Ha ha first off, anyone applying for a government office must have a history of being trustworthy.  Second, No more inflated pay for government officials.  Reasonable pay with overflow being directed back into the community and into community jobs (fire fighters, police, park rangers, etc.)  And you know...  separation of government and religion was a good idea.  Practice whatever the heck religion you want to just don't push it on others.  There's always the issue of racism too.  Everyone is equal in my utopia.  We're all human and that's what matters.      
OK this is getting out of hand.  There's so much more I could say but it would turn into a book >_<.  Going to quit dreaming before I get too deep into it then wake up and cry at the reality of the mess humanity is in."

It used to be the milk shakes at Chick-fil-A but those started getting too addictive and made me fatter than I've ever been so I put a stop to that and haven't really picked up a new snack luxury.  (Haven't been able to lose the weight from that one yet either XD)  If something is on sale at the grocery store then maybe.  But I wouldn't say there's something I can't live without.  I used to be bad about buying my lunch from the candy machine too but stopped doing that as well.  Even at my last job I refused to bring change to work with me because I might slip a few quarters into the candy machine if I had them.  It's amazing how much money you save that way!  I cut out all of those little things (well that and spending entire pay checks on fabric and craft projects XD) and managed to scrape together enough money to go to Japan!  Granted I had a decent job at the time...  Wish I could get a job at all again!!!!"

12-13 hours on a plane to Japan with the seat in front reclined all the way back so the person in front had his/her head pretty much in my face doesn't really leave space to do much of anything.  Sleep doesn't happen.  All I could really do was listen to my ipod.  Luckly they had little touch screens where you could watch a movie or look at flight stats.  The movie selection was horrible so flight stats won on that.  And the trip back sadly had the same movie selection.  The flight to Japan was interesting because my friend and I were so uncomfortable that we finally just got up and went to the back of the plane and chatted with the flight attendents.  I know you're not supposed to be up and about like that but the guys back there didn't seem to mind.  Seemed like they were glad to have the company.  On the way back I played Harvest Moon on the DS for a long time.        

I talked to strangers on the flight to New Jersey since there was a group headed to China and the couple sitting next to me was really nice and so excited about the trip.  They had a lot to share so it was fun.  We had a pretty good conversation.  Hmm  flight home from NJ I think I just listened to music.  Flight to New York was just music too but the flight home, my mom and I chatted with the woman sitting by us.  Baltimore flight was music on the way there but there was a cheap upgrade to business class on the way back so my mom treated us to that and it was super nice.  Free drinks FTW!  I drank enough to more than make up for the extra cost of the upgrade.  Had a good sleep when we got home from that flight.  Flight to and from Vegas was just ipod and DS time."

If I had to pick between just those two vacation options, I would chose visiting exotic cities and learning about them.  

Although in reality, I'm not rich so I just end up saving up money to go to VAMPS concerts (or if FAKE cames back to the US I'll be there too ;)).  I also keep saving up money to go back to Japan.  That probably fits pretty well into the ""places I want to learn more about"" category.  

If I did have the funds to go anywhere, Some places and things I would love to see include Mayan temples, Easter Island, Egypt, castles in Europe, China (I would love to see the mountains, caves, and Yangtze River.  Most of what I'd like to see in China is the natural landscape, not the cities except that I would LOVE to see Shanghai), and My dream vacation in the US is Death Valley in the spring to see the wild flowers and the salt fields.  I would also love to re-visit the Rocky Mountains in Canada as I was very young when my family was there before and I don't remember much of it.  I would also LOVE to see Hoodoos like what occurs in Alberta, Canada and in Utah in the States.  And this sounds crazy but places like Timbuktu fascinate me.  Places that once thrived and were centers of the world but are now a metaphor for ""the middle of nowhere"" or ""the far side of the Earth"".  And deserts fascinate me.  But mostly unsolved/unknown history gets me.  I love that stuff.  Probably should have gone to school for archaeology and psychology or something.  Too bad my stupid health would keep me from going on the ""adventures"" I'd love to be a part of.  

Oh well.  At least I can watch stuff about it on TV right?"

I'd probably have to go with learning to take it easy.  It doesn't matter how hard you fight, everything is fragile and life is short.  You can try to build a better life which is good.  Goals are good.  But don't focus completely on it because no matter how hard you try there are things you can't control and even if you do ""get ahead"" it's very easy to be kicked back to square one again or out of the game completely.  So just take time to enjoy things along the way.  Work towards goals but keep your eyes open and don't forget that there's fun to be had along the way.  Don't be so blinded by the goal that you don't see what you already have and the beauty that is still in the world.  (Even if that world is a little oil soaked at the moment.)  

It all comes down to balance.  Balance and the ability to learn are the meanings of life.  Good and evil, light and dark, duration of life being not too short but not too long, fun and work, splurging and conserving, shelfishness and giving etc.  And don't forget the delicate balance of the eco-systems and the entire Earth itself.  It's mind boggling to think of how fragile it really is.  Earth is a planet that's just the right distance away from the sun with just the right atmosphere and just the right tilt on it's axis to allow for life.  Yes I'm sure there are other planets out there with the same life-friendly conditions but it's so easy for outside forces to destroy it.  By this I mean something like a particular planetary alignment or something unusual happening with the sun etc.  Even forces of the Earth itself can be pretty effective in creating a massive change.  The Earth shifts slightly on its axis when strong Earthquakes occur.  

We all walk a very fine line every day without realizing it.  We're headed towards goals because forward is the only way to go but we can be so easily thrown off track.  It can be as slight as losing our balance a little in the way of simple setbacks.  It could be falling off of the tightrope but catching on to it with our hands then pulling ourselves back up in the way of major set backs.  Or it could be getting pushed off of it and plumetting to the ground in the way of major events which can range from car accidents, sickness, to even something brought on by one's self like committing a horrible crime that causes life changing consequences.  

Anyway, It's 7 am and I didn't get to sleep until after 4 am so...  Gonna try to get some more sleep now... XD"

"event","I was just thinking tonight about some of the comics I used to read.  One came to mind that I loaned to a friend but never got back ;_;.  It was the Grant Morrison version of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Kid-Eternity-Grant-Morrison/dp/1401209335/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1273636740&sr=8-1"">Kid Eternity</a>.  The art in this one amazed me.  Every page was a complete joy to look at.  I kind of stumbled upon these by accident almost 15 years ago.  The first funny part is that in high school, it turned out one of my best friends had also stumbled upon this little known set of comics before we met but was missing part 3 of 3.  She was finally able to borrow mine to read the end and a few months later, we stumbled upon an extra copy at the used book store for her!  

The second funny part is that even though I was able to pick up a few of the Vertigo series, I never really looked any further into the series to find out when it first started or anything.  So In thinking about the 3 I had and maybe looking for replacement copies, I Googled it.  Ha, I never knew the series originally started in the 1940's.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Eternity"">Wiki link</a>  Dear lord he was even involved in Teen Titans at one point pretty recently >_<.  I think I tend to prefer Morrison's antihero version...  He was reinventing him as a pretty damn cool character.  Too bad the Vertigo version deviated from that (which is actually why I stopped reading it about 9 issues in...)  

The other comic I've been thinking of lately is the version of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Black-Orchid-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0930289552/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1273638137&sr=1-1"">Black Orchid</a> by Neil Gaiman/Dave McKean.  Yet another where every page was a joy to look at.  I knew her character floated around through a number of comics for many years but never really collected any of the others.  I actually had the trade paperback of this one~ yet another thing that was randomly stumbled upon in the comic store.  I really kind of enjoyed the anticlimactic ending on this one.  

And another one that I still have most of the really artsy books to is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki_(comics)"">Kabuki</a>.  David Mack is incredible.  I've admired his style for many years.  Looks like there's been a recent addition to the series that I should look into picking up ;).  

Lastly, I wonder what happened to good old <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellblazer"">Constantine?</a>  (Aside from the movie that I didn't even see :P. I'm kind of glad too because I guess it was kind of based off of the ""Dangerous Habits"" story arc which was really great, one of my favs in fact, in comic form but was probably total fail in movie form.)  Yeah I used to love reading Hellblazer, especially when Garth Ennis was in control but I did take quite a liking to the earlier issues from Jamie Delano.  i still have all of the Garth Ennis issues hanging around here somewhere.  I stopped reading it when school got too hectic and I just didn't have the time any more.  Apparently it's still a running series.  Who'd have thought?  Oh well enough of memory lane for one night...  So I was a comic geek...  A scary dark one apparently...  (yeah I was like 12 reading Hellblazer...  Oh well I was into Stephen King in late elementary school O_o.  I was a creepy kid...)"

Um...  to be honest...  losing my job LOL!  Even though for a long time i've seen it as a negative point and am of course concerned with finding some means of survival, losing it may have been the best thing that's ever happened.  i haven't taken time out like this for many many years and even then it was all of summer vacation from school.  It's a great break but it seemed like just when you were over the stress of school and working so hard and maybe finally able to get around to doing something of your own, you'd have to go back to school again.  This long of a ""time off"" has really been a good thing.  Learned a lot, changed many points of view, and am getting to explore and experiment with art in ways i'd only dreamed of but never had time to ^_^."

It started off that i was going back to work for my old boss except it wasn't at the same location.  She was working in a clothing store in a huge mall.  Anyway, she was glad to have me back on her team again.   This was one of the bosses i really liked too so it was good to be working with her again on my end too.  (She was the type who wasn't afraid to just dig right in with the rest of us to get a job done.  And she really knew her stuff too.  She was just all around a good manager.)  So it was my first day and there was a huge sale in lingerie that left the section completely empty and the job was to reset the displays in the section so we could be ready when a new shipment came in.  Only, when we went to the section, another employee had already taken care of it.  So she had to go out into the mall over to another store for some business related reason and asked a few employees (they were just random people, i didn't know any of them) and myself to join her.  So we did.  As we were walking thru the mall, she saw a chocolate shop and decided to stop in for a quick second.  (it was a strange looking place, very dark with a rather small door to enter thru that was kept closed.)  While she was inside, the other employees and i noticed a long hallway that led to an emergency staircase~ apparently we were several floors up.  So one of them thought it would be funny to pull a prank on her and ""run away"" down the stair case and see if she finds us.  (She had a good sense of humor too in real life.)  So we did.  We ran as fast as we could down the long hall way (it was really vivid!  It was lit here and there with yellow lights that were spaced too far apart to actually light the entire hall so there were points where it got very dark.  It was rather narrow too)  But we got to the end in time and ran through the door and started running down the stairs.  The stairs were very old and the area itself was really dusty and gray.  

When we got to the bottom floor and went thru the door, it led into this room that looked and felt a lot like an old grave yard...  only with no graves.  Just dead plants and a lot of twisted out of shape black metal.  Even the walls were painted with scenery to carry the illusion.  Anyway, she found us down there and we had a good laugh.  Then it was time to go home.  So i went down a few more flights of stairs that weren't there before @_@ and into another area.  This one had a bedroom and a bathroom.  For some reason i slept on the floor.  When i woke up i started doing something but i'm not sure what only that i suddenly realized that maybe i wasn't the only person in the room and if someone else was there i'd be really embarrassed (i think i might have been singing or something like that).  So i turned around and sure enough there was a man in the bed who woke up a little.  So i told him ""go back to sleep, you're having a dream!""  and he did.  i went into the bathroom and changed clothes then went back out into the bedroom.  This time my mom was there instead of any one else.  She was looking out the window so i went and looked too.  It was a huge window and right outside, as in, right up against the building we were in was a side walk.  And on the other side of the side walk, there were waves rolling in from an ocean!  And they were getting really close to the window.  i said something like ""i hope these are sealed so that water doesn't come in!""  But the waves rolled up against the building and sure enough, water poured in.  We ran and grabbed a bunch of towels to put up against the window (as if that would do any good ;^^) because i had to get going to work again.  Then i pretty much woke up.  

Boss 

To see your boss in your dream,  represents the bossy or authoritative side of your own personality. Your boss may reveal  self-confidence and the assertive aspect of yourself. It is telling of your issues of control and authority.

Except she wasn't the controlling bossy type.  She knew how to motivate without being bossy.  So i dunno...

Mall

To dream that you are at the mall, represents your attempts in making a favorable impression on someone. The mall is also symbolic of materialism and the need to keep up with the trends, fads, and/or the latest technology.

Well yeah this makes sense in a way.  i'm going to choose not to get into it though ;).  But the fact that the only store i remember from the mall was a chocolate shop probably represents a lack of trends in my life which is good :D.

Hallways

To see a hallway in your dream, symbolizes self exploration and the beginning of a  path that you are taking in life. You are going through a transitional phase in your life and journeying into the unknown. It signals spiritual enlightenment, emotional growth physical prowess, new opportunities and mental passages in your life.  

Well...  cool! 

Yellow

The color yellow has both positive and negative connotations. If the dream is a pleasant one, then the color yellow is symbolic of  intellect, energy, agility, happiness, harmony, and wisdom.

Well, we were laughing and having fun so i'm going to assume this means the positive side of yellow.  :D

Laughing

To dream that you are laughing, suggests that you need to lighten up and let go of your problems.  Don't put so much pressure on yourself. Laughing is also a sign of joyous release and pleasure

Well i have been putting a lot of pressure on to find a job which i still can't even do yet.  i'm not quite over being sick yet and would still scare people if i went outside...

Running

To dream that you are running with others, signifies festive and prosperous times. 

Oooh i like this one :D

Stairs

To dream that you are walking down a flight of stairs, represents your repressed thoughts. It suggests that you are going into your unconscious. It also refers to  setbacks that you will experience in your life.

NOOOOO no more set backs!!!  There have been enough already and i'm trying to stay positive!  Besides, this completely goes against ""running with others"" ;^^.  i'm going to assume this is about repressed thoughts since the rest of the dream kind of ties into that.  

Graveyard

To dream that you are at a graveyard, represents the discarded aspects of yourself. It is also a fear of the unknown.

i went with graveyard instead of a dead garden because the dream made it feel more like a graveyard.  So what have i discarded?  There were just dead plants and twisted black metal...  so lets see...

Metal

To see metal in your dream, signifies strength and character. It may also symbolize the inhumane side of society. Consider the exact type and shape of metal and what you were doing with it.

Well i wasn't doing anything with it and it was all bent up and old and...

Black

Black symbolizes the unknown, unconscious, danger, mystery, darkness, death, mourning, hate or malice.   
If the feeling in the dream is one of joy, blackness could imply hidden spirituality and divine qualities. 

Well like i said, we were laughing so it was joy...  So have i discarded spirituality and so on?  Yeah i think i have.  i tend to prefer logic.  perhaps it also represents that i don't let the irrational inhumane side of myself out ever and pretend that it doesn't exist even though it does exist in some form in everyone whether it shows or not?  And honestly i tie a lot of religious and ""spiritual"" beliefs into a sense of evil because it's so commonly used to begin wars, cover up wrong doings, or control societies.

Room

To dream that you are in a room, represents a particular aspect of yourself or a particular relationship.  Dreams about various rooms often relate to hidden areas of the conscious mind and different aspects of your personality. 

To dream that you find or discover new rooms, suggests that you are developing new strengths and taking on new roles. You may be growing emotionally. Consider what you find in the discovered room.  

To see an appealing or comfortable room in your dream, signifies opulence and satisfaction in life. 

This actually works for both the graveyard room and the bedroom.  The graveyard room seems to tie into the repressed thoughts stuff.  Finding the room that wasn't there before, the bedroom, is kind of cool though.  i think i am developing new strengths by experimenting with art so much.  It's a journey every day and it's really cool what i'm learning from it.  And it was an appealing room as well and yes i am very satisfied with how things are right now.  It's perfect!  But it can't last.  It's going to end very quickly.  

Bedroom

To dream that you are in the bedroom, signifies aspects of your self that you keep private. It is also indicative of your sexual nature and intimate relations. 

i don't have any intimate relations right now so yeah...  what do i keep private?  Maybe that i do like to sing when no one else is around lol!

Sleeping

To see others sleeping, is often a reflection of yourself and your own unconscious mind. It is indicative of how you may not be alert or informed about a particular situation. 

i dunno...  if i'm not informed about something, how do i know what it is that i'm not informed about >_<.

Water

To dream that water is rising up in your house, signifies your struggles and overwhelming emotions. 

This was the closest thing i could find to the waves coming in the window.  Yeah...  emotions...  :P.

Waves

To see clear, calm  waves in your dream, signify renewal, a calm state of mind and tranquil emotions. It may also signal an important decision to be made. If you are riding a wave, then it indicates that you are trying to get a handle on your emotions. 

Yeah there's an important decision...  do i go and get a ""real"" job and lose the creative me again or do i get something that will barely pay the bills but let the creative me stick around a little?"

Yes!!!  The outfit i was wearing when i met Ken=San and FAKE? :D.  Olive green sweater, (in June but that's OK because he and some of the others had hoodies on lol!) ""Fosteer's Home for Imaginary Friends"" t-shirt, and my concert skirt.  (The one i wear because it's like a big old napkin which means it's great for sitting around on sidewalks waiting to get into the live and it doesn't matter if it gets dirty or wet or whatever ^^.)   

Next up is what i wore meeting VAMPS!  Same skirt but with my ""Pirates of the Carribean"" tank top.  No sweater that time since it was ten million degrees outside and the middle of July!

That skirt has seen some great lives ^___^.  I'd better get to sewing up the holes in it because it's going to see a few more lives this year too!!!"

Hell yeah i'd go back with them for a visit!  Assuming they're friendly since the question makes them sound diplomatic.  I'd probably spend more time asking them questions and listening to their answers than talking about Earth."

It was packaged together in a cool little zipper bag :D.  And the cloth is a nice touch.  I'll bring it along next time I go to Japan.  (Wash rooms don't usually have paper towels so it's quite common to carry your own little cloth around.  It's a nice very useful addition)."

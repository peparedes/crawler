"event","My 16th birthday was by far the best birthday I have ever had. Its not because of the presents, its not because of a wicked sweet party i had. I didnt have a party. Its not because ive had nearly 3 birthdays spent in the hospital. Its because something happened that Nobody. Nobody has ever done for me, and the one to do it was the best girlfriend in the whole entire world. By Far. Randi, made me dinner, with a table for two in the basement, lighten up by a candle, with a bowl of Cheese Ravioli with Alfredo sauce, and Brocoli on the side, served with Bawls (the best energy drink period.) in plastic wine glasses. This was the most sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me and i seriously just wanted to.. Cry, it was so amazing. I love this girl. Randi Jean Mansell, I am looking forward to growing up with you and i am deffinately looking forward to the future we will have together. I am in love with you Randi. I cant wait for you to see the most smallest gift you could ever get, but it has so much meaning :-). I LOVE YOU RANDI JEAN MANSELL."

Randi and I were fighting for like a day and a half and all of a sudden me and her hung out yesterday and we only felt closer to eachother. Thats the feeling I was looking for. We walked around hanover, including eating burritos from Boloco and hanging out in her moms office, and going to ben and jerrys and getting big ice cream cones which were good but holy cow it was a lot of food, but I dont mind eating a ton of food with Randi as long as shes doing the same. My balls hurt so bad at the end of the night and we loooked up symtoms and stuff and holy cow I thought I needed to go to the hospital. There is something wrong and I know it, its just nobody thinks so, so whatever I guess? I will just lose one. Yesterday was amazing although I think losing a testi would pretty much suck. Oh yeah, I took a shower on the phone with randi and that was quite the experience lol. I love you Randi, more than Anything."

"event","Christmas-

The best part of Christmas for me was the time I had with Randi. We were so stressed out to buy eachother stuff and everything and it took me like forever to figure out what I should have gotten her. When we exchanged gifts, it was just so nice. All the stress paid off, and it was the most bestest Christmas ive ever had. I had gotten one present from her that made me seriously want to cry. I don't know why I didn't, but I was about to, and thinking about it now still makes me so happy about it. Nobody else would understand. I didn't know a holiday could have been so amazing just because of a girl, but what me and Randi have, it all seems possible.

New Years-

New years day was okay. My grampa and uncle and stuff came over for a while but I just wanted to go to Randis house and my family wouldnt leave! When the time did come. I went to Randi's house. I brought extra clothes and my snow stuff so I could go sledding with my favorite lovely in the whole world. We went sledding for the first time together. It was fun, and I would rather spend a day sledding with Randi than a couple hours paintballing. Last night I was really tired cause I had like 5 hours of sleep. We tried to watch some movie (Ive literally lost all my memory, im so tired right now, I couldnt even remember my friends first name earlier), and I was falling asleep but Randi was a little too hyper so I couldnt sleep any longer. I watched the ball drop with Randi and we kissed during that ball drop. That kiss was very little, but I felt an ""Umph"" of happiness and love in every milisecond of that kiss. That kiss is better than making out or anything because I really felt, love. I slept over at Randi's house. We were up til like 3am and me and Austin fell asleep down stairs. I enjoyed a can of Bawls with Randi at like 1:30am and yeah. I cant stop thinking about how much I love you Randi. This morning when I woke up, I looked directly at you like RIGHT when I woke up, and it was the second most best feeling ever. Waking up with you there. Its second because the best feeling in the whole world, ever is waking up in the same bed as you. I cant stop thinking about how much I love you Randi. I love you. Its that simple, but its not. I Love you. LOVE. I. Love. You. I am in love with you Randi, and I am never letting go. I miss you as we speak, and Im smiling while typing because I cant get over the fact that We're Both in love with EAchother. I Love you my baby. Happy New Year. I would have to say that 2006 was the best year, and Im looking forward to '07 with You, Randi Jean Mansell.. Je t'aime :-)."

"event","Yesterday:

      I wrote a letter to Ross saying everything about quitting my job, and Why. I think it is about time i do this, and all of a sudden i'm getting these feelings where I am so confused about weather I do want to continue working or not. I don't want to work there anymore I dont think, because of how im treated and i NEVER feel that Im being respected as a person. So, Im quitting. and I will most likely be grounded but WHATEVER.

Today:

      Today has been very different. Today there was no Randi in the morning. It felt so different, kind of like the feeling of going to spanish class a day after Josh died. (He sat behind me). It felt like something was missing..  The day was okay, and I was laughing a lot because there were many funny moments, and nothing like Making that Matt kid in my study hall laugh. Funny shit. So, when I was coming home, I was so happy to get a call from Randi, but we couldn't really talk because i was losing service. When I got home, we were just being all blah and its all because Im feeling sad lately. I dont know why im feeling sad, So I did what Randi would probably do. I ran forever. I ran 6 miles. After about an hour i got home. It was dark, and i walked like a mile home because my arms were actually starting to hurt because it was so cold. I went running in soccer shorts and short sleeve shirt lol. I went through a whole Bullet for My valentine CD, as well as Simple Man by Shinedown, and a teary walk while listening to Hey there Dililah. It made me think very fucking hard about how much I love randi, and of course, I knew that I loved Randi, not just a Crush. I didnt have to think about it, its jus the song makes me think about her. Right now I have a feeling she hates me because im such a selfish dillhole drama causing dumbshit asshole bitchsnap. hm, i am receiveing text messages from her as I type, and Randi love. I know your the same person no matter who is around, i just would like you alone, or something. There isnt even anything to say about me being all blah, I dont know why Im being all sad this week.
    On a good note, I talked to my gram about feeling blah and she asked me what was wrong, and I told her it wasnt randi after she was asking me who I talk to when i feel down. I talked to Gram about How much I loved Randi. I told my gram that it was love, and I dont care if im 15. I cant just say im not in love because im 15. I AM IN LOVE WITH RANDI JEAN MANSELL. I love her more than anything and she is the best thing that really has ever happend to me. Who else calms me down by saying 1 word. Relax. Even better, 2 words.. Relax baby. Randi my love, lets both relax. We need to be extremely happy again. I love you, actually just as much as life, because.. you are my life. I love you more than anything in the world my love. Cant wait till you get home. Je t'aime la meme que tu m'aime."

"event","I had the worst dream last night.

I woke up crying, not even kidding. I called Randi to see if she was like.. still alive.

This was the dream.

It was a normal life at school and stuff and me an randi were still together but, we had been talking about how she was feeling depressed and possibly considering suicide. I talked to her about it and I thought I convinced her that it wasnt the right choice and I really thought I convinced her. We were walkin down a flight of stairs at the school and I said something that I didnt mean, and she took it the wrong way. ( I dont remember what I said) and like, she just left. and I was just like, oh nooo. So After i found out that she left, I tried calling her on my cell phone to make sure she was okay, and there werent any answers. I ran down to the front office and these women were like, she left.. Im sorry. and they knew exactly what was going on. This woman let me borrow her phone and I couldnt think of any number to call but then I remembered her house number and I was hoping that either her or her mom would answer and Randi would be alive like sleeping. Nobody answered.. Everyone felt sorry for me and I got on a bus and went home. When I got home I got online and checked her life journal and there was a big huge entry on everything, stuff about me, her life, her choices. When I was reading it, I could kind of see an image of her, saying it to me. This was the worse part of the dream. It was like a movie. You were saying how much you loved me but you needed to do this and just end your life you thought was bad. I tried to stop you, but I didnt. I failed. The last part in the entry was a quote i had said to you, it was paintball related but, it was something like. ""Keep your mask (like.. head) up, follow through with your shots (life), and stay strong, and you will win (things will get better).."" I remember seeing the ellipses at the end and then it said. ""..im sorry."" and it was over. Worse dream i have ever had, It was almost that feeling when I got to school and realized Josh wasnt even alive anymore. It was almost just as sad because, First of all, I thought this was real, second, shes my girlfriend, third, it was suicide. I almost started thinking.. Oh my god, I cant even imagine what Meghan Roberts felt like when Josh died, her own boyfriend burning in a house fire. Ugh. Dont like to think about it. The dream was so real. Thank God that it was JUST a dream.

I need to see you randi.. I cant wait to be with you."

I havnt gotten the mail either so Im not sure if I got that yet.

I was thinking today how, I remember waiting after school during your LAx Season and I walked you to your game and I remember Ashley was all like, Do you have a crush on her? I remember telling her, not really but After that, I was like, omg I do have a big crush on her. Guess what, we were going out like, days after lol. I love you very very very much and I dont think im going to stop. That doesnt mean that you should be a break pedal for that, but keep adding gas, cause I dont want to stop loving you. My love for you is like, HOLY SHIT!. Like right now, I am starting to run outta things to say about I love you cause Im sure Ive said every single one of them to you one time or another. You know I love you so much and Im so happy about these 6 months. I cant wait to experience the rest of our lives together, were going to skip college, well, atleast go to the same college, have like 20 kids before high school ends, and then have more kids after our kids have kids, and then geezus christ, we'll be fucking till we die.

I was thinking on the way home how, after the games I said. Good Job Austin, and Patting him on the back, and just looking out for him.. I think im doing the right thing.

The most fun part was just getting there. My dad was treating the car like it was a free gift piece of shit jackass mobile, and he was acting like he was 15 which was funny. We went to dunkin donuts and he was like, Laughing like pee wee herman, in front of this guy and then when we went in reverse we like flew and cut off some woman in the drive thru and she was flipping out and we got right outta there and then we were just whoa. Crazy. Then walmart we almost hit these carts and made some guy mad for driving reckless. It was Crazy.

So when we got there we played and yah and I did awesome. I got hit once the whole day, ended up shooting 4 or 5 people. Got my dad. My team won every game, and i dont think ive ever been so aggressive. I was the one going down the field, making the moves. Oh yes. I never ended up talking to Chase though.. I dont even know who he is. Im not sure.. so whatever.

Ont he way home we went to the Red Apple buffet thing? Omg, Ive never seen anyone eat more food than adam did tonight. He had like 6 plates, and a HUGE bowl of ice cream. Crazy. I was affraid he was going to throw up on the way home.

I was so happy to see Randi for the short minutes that I could possibly see her tonight. I gave her a kiss right in front of my dad and i was kinda eeh about that but I love to kiss her. So Blah you dad if you dont like it. Mm today was pretty good.

You sign up for a teenage dating thing and expect me not to say anything? You prolly didnt sign up because I flipped out. I know your not going to do anythiing and I know im prolly taking this way too whatever but, Id rather have a boyfriend you can go and see and be with than just talk to online and have friggen cyber sex. I know im flipping out but I wish you didnt have to leave so soon so we could like.. calm things down. Seeing you say you love me and wouldnt ever do that again made me a little happier but, leaving and saying stop with the jealousy, now.. No. You'd do the same thing. Ah Now I need to be in a better mood because Im not going to get mad at you,  I freaking love you.. and Im not going to go through this weekend thinking shitty thoughts. I love you randi, ill call you tonight."

"event","yesterday i went to randis!. Whoa what a suprise. So, When i got there, they were putting up lights and then i wanted to go get coke and mentos for that experiement thing, so we got coke and mentoes and we ate all the fruit ones, and the Mint mentoes didnt really do much in the coke, it just fizzed and yah, so we decided to waste that by throwing it in the air. SoO We Had her brother go get us diet coke. After that we made holes on the mentos and then a hole in the cap doing this really cool thing and i had to put them in and screw the cap on, but.. When I put them in, it immediatly started fizzing. It was pretty cool. I kicked it and it shot like a torpedo hah, it was so cool. Infact, i want to do it again right now. ""Im asking my dad as we speak"" SO, Anyway, after that we... went in the woods and we walked for a while and saw homeless peoples houses! Ive never seen that before, well i have just.. not there. So After that we walked back to randis house and made yummy sandwiches and we ate them with Pirates Booty and somethin else.. PHONE!... okay dad got it, So those things were so good, and we ate at the table with her and her mom and it was interesting. I forget what we talked about but, it was kinda cool sitting with her mom. I need to do that more often. Im about to go to conrads for paintball, but I dont think im playing, just watching. So Anyway we went to the hockey game after that and i wasnt really in a good mood at all on the way there and some of the game but I got better and smacked myself. SO, we sat in front of the glass whhereee least of the action was lol. But, its okay. I was with Randi. And then we found out that Her mom was watching us the whole time and the whole time we were being kinda sweet giving eachother kisses. I called my dad to get us some Ben and Jerry's Ice cream. Me and randi ate the whole pint, I liked how we faught over a piece of brownie or cookie doe :-). I had a big chunck and all of a sudden it was like.. gone! I had no idea where it went, I think it either went on the ice and looked like poop, or some little kid caught it in the air. Ohhhh yeahh. So anyway, after that we went home and looked if happy feet was playing, that would mean we could be together until nearly midnight holy manoly.!. So We did go see happy feet. It was bettter than I thought it would be. I thought it was going to basically be a musical with penguins, but thats not quitee what it was. It was about a retarded penguin and the black preist didnt like it, so he went to live in the hood with the hispanics. Oh yah lol. Major good movie. Then after my dad wouldnt answer his phone and i couldnt get a hold of him and we were in the freezing cold ah, but he did come. and we brought them home. And yeah. So, Im sitting here right now, and randi just IM'ed me, and I have to go ahhhh bad timing. Oh well. I love you freaking tons RAndi."

""I dont play Randi like a video game, but if I did, Id have the top score""..

So Today we had thanksgiving and it was okay. We had it at my sisters house and for some reason i was  happy to see my sister. Probably because she wasnt crying or anything and actually looked happy with Jerrod. HM so anyway, omg I had so much food holy cow. I had like so much food before dinner, it was crazy. I was hanging out on the couch with my aunts grandaughter and it was funny. Me and her just hanging out (shes like 4) and I was letting her play with my ipod and stuff and talking to her about her favorite rugrats and how she didnt like boys lol. Just a typical Thanksgiving day."

"event","This is a lot harder than I thought.. 

Randi just started having Cross Country skiing practice today. The past week or so I have been thinking about this a lot and I thought that, well we will talk on the phone most nights, see eachother Sundays and Maybe Fridays. When I think of it, thats not a lot of time. I was so used to going home with Randi every day, Today when I came home, the whole ride home I felt.. Lonely? Kind of a sad feeling.. I felt like something was missing, and im totally discouraged of doing my homework. When I went to randi's house, I would do homework so I can get it out of the way and be with her. now.. what do I have to look forward to after I do my homework..  I havnt even eaten yet, usually me and randi cook something when we get home, and right now it feels like Im kinda waiting for her to choose something to make, but that decision wont be made. I kinda feel like im writing about if she died or something.. Im not sure if I can deal with this for the whole summer, and then the Spring. But Ive gone 3 weeks without even seeing her before so I should be fine. I kinda wish she didnt do anything during the winter so we could be with eachother every day and play in the snow and stuff. BUt, She wants to, and its going to get her like whoa for lacrosse hopefully. MMm.. This is so hard oh my goodness Im so EMO right now Ahh. On the way home I kept looking at my phone for a text message but, I cant get them when she has practice, when im going to have to get used to. Im dont even know what to do right now, 'cept I can not wait for vacation. And then after that, be home every day alone. What this is basically saying is, I miss you randi, like fucking holy shit. Its hard to spend half the day away from you, no matter how stupid it sounds. I love you so much Randi."

"event","I duno why but i was in a horrible mood last night. It wasnt good. Cause i kinda spit it out at randi, and it made me feel like I was treating her like shit. but it didnt help that libby hung up on me. I felt kinda sad and mad because I came home from work so i could talk to randi, and turned out she was at the movies. On the way home I had a talk with my mom about randi, like about sex and stuff. I just told her the truth and stuff so she could know what was going on and so she knew how i really felt with randi. She said something that I wasnt too happy with, so im not sure if i am going to talk to my mom about that stuff. So, I dont have anyone to talk to about it even though she said i can still talk to her about anything. Well, I got home and randi called or something, and i talked and libby hung up and i was about to just turn my phone off and say good night and wait to talk in the morning, but me being me was being blah and stupid and i just made emo remarks, and blah. My mom let me have the phone all night but i didnt have anyone to talk to on it. Oh well. Randi needed a day without anything to do with me anyway. So anyway, this morning we talked and i was okay and i won my maddan game and it was amazing, scoring the winning touchdown with 2 seconds left, an 80 somethhing yard touchdown. yes. so anyway me and randi talked and i went all blah again and she went blah but i think we're better and im about to leave to leb and do stuff then maybe go to randi's if libby leaves, but i dont think that will happen and i an type so fast right now, and ive havnt even looked at the computer yet, im watching Phantom Gourmet or something, lol. Its so cool, I hope this all turns out correct instead of me like pressing the button to the left of every button that i want, cause it would look like this.. u kicw e(CAPS LOCK)BSU (figure that out.. )"

"event","yesterday i went to randi's house after school, again. When we got there, we cooked like, chicken and steak strips which made me feel obese but it was alright lol. we layed on the couch for a while watching some Dallas Cowboy Cheerleading thing which was kinda weird watching fat huge boobed woman jump in the air. But.. atleast Im alive?. So, we had this whole thing with randi asking me stuff, and what my favorite stuff is. She started asking about my body which i was just kinda eeehh about cause i hate myself from every direction sometimes, but. When Im with randi, i honestly enjoy who i am, and it shouldnt matter what i think about what i loook like, im with randi, what i look like, is okay with randi, then its okay with me. So, blah blah not sure, then we went to D'angelos or whatever, and that was pretty cool. I got a free drink so its okay. We played the penny hocky game we tought randi at a resteraunt coming home from the soccer game. Which was like WHoa, SHe made it so if i scored, shed win, so I just messed up  way obviously but its okay, we tied. :-D!. So we were going home and randi mentioned a movie that guys watched at Explo, she didnt know the name.. well.. I did.. unfortunately.. so i was kinda depressed for a while, but, bLAHHHHHH!!!! SO, We got back to randis house and watched John Q. We were all teary through it and i like, never cry in front of people, specially over movies, but its okay i was with randi, and thats okay if i cry in front of her. After the movie, it was interesting. We went to the basement really fast and kinda. yeah. Va-VOOOM! SO, anyway, it was good. So we went back upstairs and her dad was gone, and we tried to watch another movie, but she was really tired so i offered to tuck her in. She told me to carry her, but she didnt want me to, although i can. and she knows that. But, i brought her in blankets and she layed down and i covered her and i brought her water and pluged in her cell phone :-). I layed with her for like 10 minutes till my dad came. Unfortunatly i had to say see you later, but hopefully to her, i was still there for the night. I think i left my water bottle on the porch. But, I am in Love with you Randi Mansell. Oh My God. Its amazing."

So we found a path to her backyard, and we went back there and we wanted ice cream, and i wanted to see her in general. So she just told us to go, and i think she was getting pissed. and im sorry for that. we did get our ice cream, and we did come home and make sundays. but.. randi got in trouble. her mom woke up and grounded her until further notice. :-/. I feel HORRIBLE for this. Im so sorry randi, you have no idea. You can be mad at me for a long time, just not forever please. damn.
I love you.

So I have nothing to do and the internet WAS blocked until i convinced the sub, i had nothing to do. Im not quite sure what to do right now, prolly look at paintball stuff, talk about randi in my mind, type about randi on here, or something lol. Today im going to adams house and my dads going to bring make up and make us scary, so it will be kinda cool. Later on im going to go to randi's to hang out with her. I dont really like how she says we arent going to hang out cause it just kinda sounds like she doesnt want to, but when I said taht in the hall, she kinda wanted to walk away, but, i do want to hang out, and Im sure we will.  This morning when she was all like, away from me or something, she was with ashleigh and she was like, yeah going trick or treating with ashleigh so.. kinda ruined my plans, but. Maybe shes sick of hanging out all of the time. Not sure. Today, ive been kinda laying off a little bit, not being so touchy feelie, once in a while ill be kinda normal, but, whatever i do, is depending on what randi is doing today. If it looks like she doesnt wanna kiss, i wont kiss. No holding hands? I wont hold hands. Im just kinda going along with whatever so i dont mess anything up, or make either of us feel awkward. I do have to say, I deffinatly feel like this relationship is dipping down this week. It doesnt feel like it did just a couple days ago when we felt like we're (or atleast I was) madly in love with eachother. Im not quite sure. I might talk to her about it tomorrow night, but Ill see how the rest of today goes, and tomorrow. this little dip thats going on the past 2 days, isnt going to last, and by couple days, we'll be just as happy again. I dont think this is anything serious, it just kinda scares me when it feels like randi doesnt want anything to do with me at a moment, such as last night. I dont even want to resort to last night, im still trying to forget about it all except me making her happy by using some sort of magic that comes to me every once in a while. I love you so much Randi, i hope we hang out tonight. Je Vous aime beaucoupe"

I love cooking with Randi! Anyway, we were hannging out and stuff and we did our homework and after that Randi just became all emo, and I didnt like it. It was making me emo.  She was being like mad or sad at something different every other minute. I think its PMS. But, I wanted to ask and she just wouldnt tell me but i just kinda tried narrowing it down, and I think its just PMS and Frustration with homework.. I just dont like the fact that I usually have to try to use process of elimination to figure out whats wrong and usually she never talks to me about most of her problems.. I really dont like that, but atleast we arent a fighting couple that hate eachother?. Thats what I was talking about when I had to leave randi, but, its okay.. we'll talk about it later.

"event","Today we went to OSG, (Me, Nick, Dad, Jeff.) So we went there and we bought paint on the way called.. Big Ball.  There is a barrel called a Stiffi barrel and we were making jokes on saying, I have a stiffi and Big Balls, or, Id like to buy big balls for my stiffi and stuff like that lol..  We got there and omg there was so many cars, like.. 300 cars.. amazing.. It was so cold tho! I had 3 shirts, and a sweatshirt i wore, and my paintball pants, my sandana. It was alright.  So blah we got ready and the first game kinda sucked.. we played at the castle, and me and nick went all the way left and nick got hit, and i just shot and didnt hit anything and the game was over before i knew it, so whatever. Im not sure what the order of the games were so.. One game, we played in Western town, and Off the break, my gun kinda crapped but whatever, i got in a little building and shot and nothing happend blah. sO we played western the whole day basically, so one game, I was behind a building, and I saw a woman running and i shot a lane (shoot in one spot really fast, and let them walk into it) and she walked into it and i felt bad i shot a woman but its paintball, dont feel bad! She was planning on shooting you back if you didnt get her! so anyway that game, I got her, and then some issues were going on.. Our right side was falling apart and the people on the left were coming our way, and i was the only one paying any attention at all, and this little kid was behind something watching the left side. So really, some kid on the other team came down the left side, and the little kid on my team was like THERE HE IS! and im just like.. then shoot him! HE shot and ran outta air, so i was like.. Crap.. He got shot, and I saw the kids hopper so i snapped out and tried shooting him, missed.  Someone on the right side, shot my leg, 4 times.. 4.. I was like, omg.. wow, that was dumb.. and i was walking back and there were like 10 kids hiding and scared and i just got frustrated they didnt do anything. So, after another game at the western town, we were on the other side, and we went down the right side, like my dad, nick, jeff.. so we went down a couple buildings, Nick.. got shot.. Jeff.. got shot.. Me and my dad were shooting at things, and i got in an angle where, I could see thru a hole in the wall, but there was an opening right next to the hole and people were shooting at me through that, and people were shooting at me from kinda behind so i was pinned, i was MAKING sure my dad didnt get hit, like telling him where people are and stuff, but whatever he got hit.. so I was shooting and i got a kid in the window, and there were more.. But i was running out of air, and my paint wasnt going anywhere so i just walked off, and since there wasnt much air, the paint didnt go thru my barrel, and then one would and break all the paint in my barrel, so I went to clean it.  As i was cleaning it, a ref from the place came up to me and hes like..

Him - Are you on a team?
Me- No, not yet
Him - Well, a couple of us play for OSG and we are looking for more players, and we're wondering if your interested in playing.  We are sponsored by OSG and we can play on the speedball fields for free.
Me- Oh, Really? Im very interested.
Him- Do you have enough money for it?
Me - Yeah I have a job
Him- Transportation?
Me- My dad.. lol..
Him- Where do you live?
Me- Plainfield..Near lebanon
Him- Well, Can I have your number? 

We exchanged numbers and I might be on a team soon Yay!.


The last game we played in the castle again, and we were in the castle this time.  We were playing, and I shot a guy in the face, and then, I was shooting out a little window the shape of a cross, and all of a sudden some kid ran up to it and stuck his gun in and shot me in the head, mask, gun 3 times, and my flexy part on my mask. OMg that was so scary, i felt like it was a murder scene outta some scary movie omg.  lol, thank god for thickness in sandanas!. SO, Thats prety much it.

Ima call you soon randi, just need to shower and then prepare for some talking causse im basically going to read you this, and talk to you!

I lovee you very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very much!

I couldnt even start to explain just how happy I am right now.  Im not even sure if anyone realizes it, but this is probably the most happiest ive been in a lonnnnnng long time. Last night was an addition to my love for Randi..

Last night me and Randi went to the bowling alley to hang out and do something we've never done together before.  I had my own stuff there like a ball and shoes, I know im a loser.. but, We bowled like  3 games each and it was funnnn.  The first game, Randi's first role was a strike and im like, whoa... and I got like an 8 or something. but I guess it was just a warm up, cause i started droppin dat bitch lik it was hot damn! lol.. but yeah.. We bowled and just had a good time, and we werent being all touchy feely eather, just a ""cute"" couple.  On our third game, Randi HAD to get a 100 or over, but it just didnt happen.  I offered to give her my points but lol. So, We decided to play some games after, and get a bunch of tickets and just leave them for kids.  We played a spinny game whatever, some ski-ball thing, Bingo? and Yah, and There was a kid that was playing games and getting tickets, and we gave him like 10 tickets we got from FEeding thing woman thing lol, and he was i guess a little happy.  After playing bingo like 10000 times, we got like 137 tickets.  Ah we wanted to get some toys or whatever with them, but we did something that, I even had a little uplifting from.  We gave that little kid all of our tickets, and his face was so.. I dont know, made him loook so happy, it was amazing.  He didnt say thank you or anything, but that face was worth it.  So, my dad picked us up and we were going to go have dinner at the 99. When we got there, there were people all over inside there and it looked busy but, we went inside and I saw the girl that always fills my air tank at the paintball store, and whaddya know, she knew my last name and wrote it down like without even asking, just making sure.  So, we got a little beeper thing so i gave it to randi cause she gets ammused by little things like that =P.  Randi wanted to go to.. CVS, but im like, whoa we cant go all the way over there, but i guess she meant, Brooks.  So we went inside there and just walked around the isles and into the Condom Isle and was just kinda like.. uh.. and then there was a lice comb next to them and that grossed me out so i ran, into the Adult Diaper things so i ran again into a save area.  AH God. Ew. So , we walked around and started to.. plan for what our house is going to be like and stuff.. what we are going to need for our house.  But yah we were looking around and then we went to that kitchen store place.  We saw a pink blender thing that ammused Randi, and then we looked at glasses and stuff.  Just kinda walking around.. Cake Molds, there was one that looks like a castle and it looked cool but it was like 32 dollars WHOA!. Ut oh, my cats meowing, 1 sec....kay. After looking in there, I was wondering what people would do if we walked into the liquor store thing.  So i went in and purchased 20 gallons of pure vodka.. not really. so we walked back to the restaurant and the thing buzzed.. yay! We went in and got seated.  Randi got Sierra Mist and I got Pomegranet Iced tea, which was good. It came in a really cool glass, and it looked like I was drinking some sort of alcohol. Anyway, we were talking and eating pop corn waiting for our food. We also threw popcorn at eachother and made a special blend of sugar, salt, meatsauce, and i dont know, trash?.. But anyway,..  I had this moment, where.. I was just like.. looking at randi, and I couldnt look away.  I was just thinking of how happy I was, and how good the night was going.  I just saw.. love, i dont know.. just, I felt the happiness and love that I have for her like popping out of my heart and into my blood stream and i was just whoa. After making myself feel stupid by saying.. ""Savoring the moment"" lol.. we just kept on being there and got our food.  I got Teriaki Chicken and Randi got the Honey BBQ Chicken Wrap.  My food was pretty good. We just talked a lot and ate our food, and I think we were both pretty freaking full after that.. blughh.. When I got the bill thing, I felt like such an adult, like.. taking my girlfriend out, eating by ourselves, no one to tell us what to do. Mm, Yeah. I payed and we walked out and i guess we went to Shaws. Randi pushed me in a shopping cart, lol, and it was fun, and we went to shaws and just walked places? I duno, so she called her mom to see if she could pick us up.. I didnt really want her to cause shes been in a bad mood forever and I didnt wanna make her drive us around. But whatever.. sO she picked us up and we went to Randi's house for the rest of the night.  We picked a movie to watch, went to the basement, and like.. passed out.  We layed together to keep eachother warm, and Randi, you passed out before I did yay.  But, Having randi so close to me, warm, in the dark, waddya expect.. I fell asleep for a little bit too.  I think we both woke up to my dad calling and saying he would be there in a minute.  I woke up like drooling lol it was funny. So I wanted to just give randi a couple kisses before I had to leave and just let her know I had an amazing time with her.  During all of that, she was still like.. gone. but, she got up and went upstairs with me and I kissed her goodnight and I drove home. mmmm, I got home and just went nearly straight to bed, except i helped my mom with her pills.  I called randi, and we talked last night but I dont really remember much, and I woke up at like 2am, with my mom being all ike.. What are you doing on the phone? and I flipped out cause why the hell would she be in my room at 2am... wtf.. so i threw the phone and said, fine im off. and went to bed. Last night, I was laying with My temperpedic pillow thing and my head was laying on randis sweatshirt, and my hand was on the lump of my pillow, and It felt like I was sleeping with randi, omg. It was so real, i really thought I was and then I woke up and I wasnt.. blah... so.. This morninng at like 6:30, Randi called! :-D!. She called my cellular, and I got scared cause its loud, and i answered and i think i hung up.  I called her back on my white phone.  We talked till like  freaking 8 o clock and she had to work so she had to go. I miss her already, im so obsessive now ahh. But what can I say, I love her =D.

I walked around school today all day, pissed at the world. I Couldn't hide my disgust for ppl. I have no friends I feel, the ppl that come into my life I push away. I have you to thank you fucking asshole. You made me like this, I can't trust anyone!!! I don't trust myself. I hate you for that, but love you cuz I have too. I wish you would just go away and never talk to me again. But U dont', You always come back and throw me off. I AM LOST!!!!!!! This is hopeless. Trying to explain yourslef is never going to help, and especially when its to ppl that don't even KNOW you. I feel trapped in a life i can't escape. I JUST WANT OUT..."

Ya, well of course they are having ""problems"". Their whole relationship is a problem. He doesn't even allow her to hang out with her friends.

When I was tlaking to her on the fone I told her that I am kinda questioning being her friend. And she asked why.

The reason why my friends is, because everytime I do, as soon as her and her boyfriend get back together I get ditched. Its like hey Kym... Kym who? It has gotten rather old.

Well after I told her that she started bitch and whinning about how she thought I would understand. Ya, whatever save that shit for another dumb friend. I have heard it too many times.

Now that I am totally sick I guess I can tell you about my day. I did eventually get to SPanish town. It was weird. We walked around ALOT.
'
I saw Jayme and Mallori, we hung out with them, until they sorta walked off with Morgan and them. Oh Well.
'
We then walked the parade route like fifty times! Ugh. We finally settled in the best spot ever. It was great, like bead heaven or something. 
'
We left there and Josh and I went to go eat @ like our favorite place in the world... LA FONDA'S. After that we went to my house and slept.
'
Then we saw Boogey Man. It was gay. I advise all of you to save your money for something more amusing like say... a barrel of monkeys.
'
But While we were there he called me Brittany. I almost died. It felt like someone just knocked the wind straight out of me. I couldn't breath or say anything. My HEART DROPPED. This my friends is definetly going on the list of worst feelings ever.

Now Let me inform you I didn't write on the back of this desk. I personally don't see the need. I don't think I will be doing that next year in college, But Hey! Whatever. SOme Ppl are a little too mature... riiight.

Well At first I thought it was some what cute. And I said aww look at that. haha until some black gurl told me that by my name it said ""ugh!"" and the exclamition point was done with a heart. So must have been a gurl.

Seeing as how I am a senior and this sort of thing is some what like a freshmen would do... It STILL bothered me. If anyone saw something written about them it would  bother you.

So in conclusion. I just wanted to say this...

"event","i went to the mall.

While Ryan and I were at the mall today we met a very strange person. Well she wasn't strange, more less how we met her was strange. Well we (Ryan and I) were waiting for the evil Dillards employee to wrap JOshie's gift and We went strolling thru the mall. The woman said about 40 mins. So We tried to go to the food court to sit, but hmmm there were alot of hungry ppl, and no avaliabe seats. Go figure!

We went downstairs to the Front Entrance of the mall. There we sat on the bench and I had to unfortunatly listen to Ryan comment every poor female that walked past. Yup thats right, comments like, ""Wow look at that ass, Common mama give it to me!!!!"". Great stuff.

But oddly enough some black chick actually sat next to Ryan. Ya Hard to believe! Well You know Ryan so funny, and damn talkative. We found out alot about this chick and she worked at the mall and was stranded without a ride. I offered to take her home. She accepted. 

Then we (Ryan, the black chick, and I) were off to pick up my gift to Joshie from the evil Dillards woman. While struggling to get thru the herds of ppl in the mall we learned alot about this gurl. Her name is very long and begins with a D, so she told us to call her ""D"". Well anywho, D, is 20 years old. Her mom is in jail for life for murder, and she doesn't know who her father is.

Anyway I asked this gurl to come to church with me. I gave her my number and I hope she calls. It felt really good. She seemed to be in need of direction and great ppl. So I thought our church would be perfect.

It was weird its like GOd lead her to us. She is so troubled. I will be praying for her. 

Hmmm... Crazy

Anyway I got all of my christmas shopping done. Thank goodness. Otherwise I would have died, I also successfully spent my entire check in the span of say 2 hours. Ya, I am a professional shopper. I should have like a gold medal.

Well I'm outtie, English Exam tomorrow.

School is almost out, thank GOD! This week, however, will be filled with outrageous amounts of studying and cramming. Ughhg what a week. Hmm The first 2 exams are def. the hardest! Physics and Trig. What a day a huh? Ya looking forward to it. . . Not

Hmm The other day this guy, I won't mention his name pissed me off to an indescribable amount. He was just such a jerk and such a punk. Its like his goal for the day was to hurt my feelings.

Maybe this character has is own issues. But um Dude dont' take your lame ass life out on me. Well that is how I felt, I didn't say that.  

But in church saturday we were looking in Romans 13, and while Mr. Corey went on about his *Hunting* trip (who cares), I went back and re-read chapter 12, and in there was a few versus that were so great. 

Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: ""It is mine to avenge: I will repay"" says the Lord. On the contrary:

           ""If you enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thristy, give him something to drink. In doing this you will heap burning coals on his head.""

Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
                                   -Romans 12:19-21

When I read that, it made so much sense. I don't know how you might take it, but I look at like the old saying... Kill em' with kindess. If you give your enemy water when the are thirsty in some testaments it says that he will fill guilty for his wrong doing upon you. So Like I said... I'ma be killing that kid with Kindness! Oh Ya.

And Lyd that could so help you with your problem at work.

I must be going now guys.

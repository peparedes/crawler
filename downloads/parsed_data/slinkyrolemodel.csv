got this from marie's xanga. boredom to its max right now. i should probably shower and study for awhile before i go out. but all i really want to do is go back to bed. 

the only significance tomorrow will hold for me is the fact that its wilson's birthday.
 
your right alicia. i'm searching for something that isnt there. whats wrong with me? its like my natural reaction... like i dont deserve anything remotely close to good, and here my mind is trying to sabatoge my life so i will be miserable forever. maybe i shouldnt have cancelled my appointment on friday."

"event","being sick sucks really bad. i feel completely lousy but better than this morning. 

chapel was good. at the end he had us get down on our knees, and until that point i was able to keep everything in. but when i got on my knees i couldnt keep it in any longer. i just let go and cried so hard. lee is awesome, we sat afterwards and talked about a lot of things. we missed out next classes because we were talking. it was cool with my prof though, she really thinks i need to go talk to someone about some stuff. i should i just hate going to do this...

on a side note i dont really want to finish my stats but i need to. 

i'm gonna go finish watching you've got mail."

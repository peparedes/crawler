"event","Okay soooo...**exhale** okay so just to start this
off my weekend was just like **runs around frantically
around the room yelling with excitment and laughs**

OOOOOKKKKAAAYYYY-so lets see friday was kinda a bummer 
mean my mom's friend sandra who I had literally known my
whooollleeee like was in the hospital and I didn't get to
leave to see my loverly boyfriend, bobby. So then the next 
day me and my mommy begin our long and fun-filled trip to
'Americus' yes I said it. And so it was fun riding in the
car with her for about 3 hours and 19 minutes. I mean those 
the moments I cherish above all.

So we get there and we drive by the college and then we are 
like 'well now we need a hotel' so I give him a call and 
his friend josh was there and I was like 'hey we are here ummm 
were is a good hotel?' and I can hear josh in the background
naming off all these hotels cause he is like the freakin'
info man about Americus. So we are driving and I saw a liquor 
store called 'Mikes Party Center' and I just get the word 
Mikes out and both of them yell 'STAY THERE' so me and my 
mom waited and they pulled up, it was, lol, quite a thing.

Josh was this bouncy guy always grinning and just a good ol'
southern boy just not southern? So he is telling us all
these hotels and bobby is leaning against the car practically
falling asleep and it was adorable. lol. So me and my mommy finally 
decide to go to the holiday inn and before hand josh had said 'do
you want exspensive, nice, or cheap.' it was just one of those 
haha moments. So we get there and my mom sits on one of the beds 
and bobby and josh sit at the little table at the window, while I 
at the desk in the middle of the questioning, cause we it seems
it was joshes borthday and I would be going. So after all that
they left and I changed and showered in which we discovered I
hardly packed and had to ask my mommy for about everything.

So bobby comes to get me and he is awake. So me and him go back
to his dorm which is actually an old office building and I was just
tickeled by this so we stayed there till about 8:30 till josh and
his girlfriend antonia who is from masadonia and she was just too
cute, and then there was elliot and tupac-elliot is the jewish 
version of donny ozzmen and tupac was the white guy with a thick
southern accent and kinda looked like the bad guy from wild west.
and then there was shane. Okay he was my favorite,
lol, he is this short guy about my height and was really tan
was about 27 and was missing a few teeth and was wearing these huge
and button up with a vest and beanie and had this youngish kinda
gay/surfer voice. He is from cali. and then there was paul enough said. 
I was the youngest person there next to bobby who is 18.

Okay so we all head out to this girl named ann and she is hosting the
little shin-dig and well we are waiting out on her porch was like a 
pony keg of beer and everyones arms are filled with alcohol so as we
start setting up the fun really began to start everyone is having 
fun and talking and laughing and as more people begin to show up
don this real life version of big gay Al' showed up and prisilla 
the transvestdite. lol. She(him) was actaully pretty with peroxide
blond hair and a strip of pink in her(his) hair. All and all the party
was fun, me and bobby left early though to spend some time together, 
and headed back to the hotel at like 12. and hung out with my mom. 
I surprises me alot how much she and my dad like him-o'well its a 
good thing. So after he left me and my mom ate junk food and gossiped.

So we then fell asleep and I must say it was a goodnights sleep though
my mommy thought it was funny that I like screwdivers but not beer. haha-
as I said me and my mommy are best friends. So the this morning I woke up
and spent some more time with him and he hung out with us till we left, it 
was so nice, I needed it alot. you know. So as we drove back we went to
this metaphysical book shop to watch this documentary and then went
to some island/carribean resturant with ms. pam and bren her lovely
daughter brenn who me and her are planning a road trip together. So after
laughter and funny reggai music we left and went home so in which I wrote
this post, fun, this weekend rocked, later."

Okay so my holiday break has kicked some major ass and in 
which I feel so **jumps around and spins**so damn happy. I
just want it to never end, this feeling of ease and complete 
happiness. I want to have this light hearted smile on my face,
and I want to not have to worry of things that involve school 
and people. **lays head on palm** this is how things are supposed
to be.

Okay so enough with all the happy-talk :).OKAY-so my new years,
was indeed a treat, I went with mister ellis to some party at
jeremys and there were actually people there that I knew!
Okay but first lets jsut say motorcycles are fun, cause me and mister
ellis went there on his motorcycle and we it was so much fun, though
it was FREEZING...I couldn't feel my hands for at least 30 minutes.

Okay so then we had to wait on a group of people to get the beer,
and then we went to the liquor store and got liquor and it was
then on that le-drinking began I had a few sips/gulps of some peoples drinks
so then I got my own screwdriver-though I am told it was really weak,
but I wasn't complaining, it tasted really good. So anyways we watched 
firework and there were roman candle fights and well all around it was
fun. Well anyways, later kiddies.

"event","Okay, today was nice, you know just nice the kinda of nice where you sigh
and are grateful your life doesn't suck like some 3rg world kids, or just like
some pitiful kid with nothing but depressing shit.
Today hally made me laugh her ""THOSE WHORES"" comment made my life right there,
and as you can see thats right there is one complete life. Oh besides that my mommy
picked me up from school and well I went home and just collasped into my dad's recliner
idk, since my leg has been hurt its like messed with my immunes system or something
I get to go to the doctor again for my 5th look at it in about a 2 month time spand
I am just hoping that I am not put on another med they are annoying.
But besides that I later woke up and just went crazyyy, I mean like bawling over
the simpliest thing, now that I think about it,thats kinda funny. But yea thats my day.

Later
<333,
caitlin"

Dear(insert name),

Hey there kid,well another year and still can hardly string a sentence around you. I can hardly say whats on my mind and it sucks...I mean I remember,well thats not the point and well. I know its been lame of me to think that I can't talk to you. I mean you aren't jesus though you kinda look like him.lol.I mean I hate the fact that this has been blown outta porportion.

I mean sry but sadly it got this why cause I couldn't get the nerve really to tell you, I feel like some obessessed fan girl trying to see if she can scream the loudest to get her favorite singers attention. And believe me the last thing that I want is you being freaked by me. I mean you are cool as shit and I respect who you are and are able to speak your mind.And still make me laugh unintentionally. 

If you wonder why I like you, I truthfully don't get it either, it was like BOOM and then there I was liking you. And believe me it was confusing as hell,kinda like now when I don't even know whats gone on only what people have told me. And I don't like it at all. Not one bit. And even as I write this I don't know if you'll read it, but what the hey, confession is good for the soul.

But hey I just wanted to get my story out and that I still hope we are cool, the last thing I want is a friendship over cause something like this. Well later kid.

"event","Today is the last day of the season. We are happy to leave but really sad at the same time... I am glade to leave my job because i didn't really like many people i worked with.. except for a few. But i'm going to miss waking up to snow falling outside. I'm going to miss looking out onto beautiful snow covered mountains everyday. The view is AMAZING. And i'm going to miss the thrill of snowboarding. of flying in the air and going really really fast down a run. Sprinting through the trees and almost running into a small house. sigh... good times.


these are the things that i'm going to miss. but life goes on, me and Sean are stronger and more in love then we have ever been. He makes me happy. We are heading to Europe in a few days and doing a really big trip. I'm happy i'm going to see my family in Croatia. But i am even happier that i am all that closer to be going home. I miss my family &amp; friends. that is the hardest part about traveling. sometimes you just want a hug from someone who loves you. I'm very fortunate to have Sean here for that, he saved me.

soon, we shall see each other again... but what to say, there's too much to say."

I'm sick as a dog and afraid of getting anmonia. But i think if i keep my thraot warm i can avoid this. The first couple of weeks were super hard. Being my first time living out of home...living in another country and the first time me and sean&nbsp;have permanent residence (for a while) in the same bed.<br /><br />This factor alone caused me much greif and also much anger. I was homesick, depressed, bored and sick... so you can imagine my hatred toward this place at first. However like so many other things it has grown on me. Waking up in the morning watching snow fall through your bedroom window. Sleeping next to sean everynight. Kissing in the snowfall. Making new friends, Going out all the time (even if it is to the same pub) and most of all living with the best friends i could ever have.<br /><br />I am extremely excited to see joey in a couple of weeks. Plus i get 2 days off after new years eve to spend with her :)<br /><br />We have finally satrted real work and im more nervouse then i thought i woudl be. Actually taking money off people (in front of there faces) is harder then i remember. I think i just need to get back into the swing of things.<br /><br />at the moment it is 7:42pm on saturday night, which means im working the late shift until 8pm... it isn't bad but as you amy have guessed im alone, cold and coughing over everything i touch and see. I have lost some weight. not enoguh to restore me back to my former glory (not like im hopeing to get there anyways) btu just enoguh to feel a little bit more confident insetad of a tubby tub... you know the tall girl with the small beer gut!<br /><br />i wish i could be in brisbane, i can't beleive i wasted so much time just tsitting around and not doing anything! i ened to get things done when i come back:<br /><br />- volanteer at the RSPCA<br />- start yoga classes with shannyn<br />- swimming for excercise<br />- FINISH UNI!<br />- move out of home<br />- start taking a plan of action and getting in as much painting in as possible<br />- work a GOOD&nbsp;job (part-time)<br /><br /><br />i hope it all goes well until then! looks like the Europe plans are comming together nicely!<br /><br />Sandy xoxox<br /><br /><br /><br /></em>"

I knew he was going to get sick of the little thing, she so cute though but he gets annoyed really easily and manages to want something new every week. He can afford it, but the puppy is a living breathing thing, he shouldn't have just given up on her or else he shouldn't have bought her in the first place. <br /><br />this weekend was heaps of fun and i couldn't have asked for a better 'holiday' before a 'working holiday' :)<br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><br /></span><div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-size: smaller;"">i miss sean</span></span></div><div style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</div>"

Well it's not all that bad, i mean apart from wanting to destroy and burn down the building I'm making valuble and really sweet friends. This is what its like. You get to wokr hopeing that during your stay there the systems crash and the corperation crumbles all the while trying to avoid doing anything even related to whatever they trained you for, talking to you friends and having some good laughs. Even left wing interlectuals work here, yeh its a suprise... no? I mean i work here just for the money until i leave, but they actually work here as a 'career'. tell me, what the HELL is a career, maybe somethign to make our lives seem forfilled? maybe somethign to pass the time so we dont have to even think about life and our place within the world? its all a load of shit to me. One thing i've learnt by reading up on buddhism and a couple of my favourite comic books and musicians is that nothing in this life or the next will ever fill that empty, desiring, needy whole in our hearts that makes us into the corprate slurs or in debt parents that spend mroe then they have. I mean whats life if you have no desire to ask why, even when you think you knwo everything. Seriously its not even worth it. Life wont ever be what you want it to be, you will never satisfy your desires and things most things wont turn out the way you want it too. But who cares, have a drink, spend time with your family, feel strong and connect yourself with the wild, connect youself with the world and realise your soul and accept the fact that nothing will ever satisfy your need and you can finally be free!

"event","for a moment she re-discovered the purpose of her life.
She is here in earth to grasp the meaning of its wild enchantment
and call each thing by its right name!
- Boris Pasternak


TO CALL EACH THING BY ITS RIGHT NAME... TO FEEL AND SPEAK THE TRUTH!

ALL I WANT IS THE TRUTH, NOT MONEY, POSSESSIONS, SECURITY ... JUST TRUTH 
and to show people the knowledge that the truth exists!

The truth of the things that I smell and touch. The truth of the fresh, beautiful, crisp air that I breath into my lungs when I stand up to smell the morning breeze blow by me. To feel the grass between my toes and to run like the wind, passing souls that have stood in the same place for thousand of years. To howl at the moon, to feel death and not run away but face it with my primitive desire. To seek that which cannot find me between these buildings. I look upon the earth, the reflections shining off the waters and trees, overwhelmed with the contentment that I belong not only in the world but I belong to it.

deliberate living: conscious attention to that basis of life, and a constant
attention to your immediate environment and its concerns.

all true meaning resides in the personal relationship to a phenomenon, what it means to you and how you value it."

He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.


i feel like im trapped in repeat, i feel like when i look at someone less fortunate then me i dont feel the same instant desire to do whatever is possible to help them and put there lives in front of mine. i feel like ive let go of my younger feelings, like ive given up and grown up but i haven't taken with me the most important parts of my childhood. My compassion, my spirit and my awareness.

i don't observe anymore, i just sit and stare, thinking about something supid and almost always miss my bus stop.

    I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavouring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
    But, lest it should be supposed that I believe many other things in addition to these, I shall, in the progress of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them.
    I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
    All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
    I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe."

i thought i was past that, but i have to admit they were fun.

i guess i just feel like i'm wasting my life at the moment.. it should be funner, funnier, more energetic, more partying.. I'M STILL YOUNG FOR CHRIST SAKE!!
i shouldn't be spending my weekends going to bed at 10:30 and watching movies or playing board games... my wild spirit is fighting to be released i guess.. and its tarring me apart from everything that i love. Maybe i just need more balance. maybe i just need one party night to get really drunk and pass out... go out clubbing & beforehand somewhere.. and just have some fun. flirt a little.. & DANCE oh DANCE LIKE I'VE NEVER DANCE BEFORE!!
maybe i just need to be around the people who remind me who i am, who i love to be around just.. because.

i don't know, maybe its just a faze; maybe im just trying to find excuses to get rid of my relationship; maybe im hurt because i use to be fun

i said im sad because we dont make love as often.
he says he doesnt feel the need to.
he gets his love from other things we do.
i get sad.
and sadder.
eventually i confront him
tell him how i feel (but without yelling!)
i hate yelling.
he acts like its just me complaining.
but then i tell him i NEED him to want me and love me.
he hugs me. and we hold eachother for a little while. all seems just that little better.
then he said he loves me.
and then he told me straight after that he doesnt think we will last.........
this is where everything goes wrong.
we both love eachother to peices.. like crazy crazy.. but he thinks everything should be perfect. he doesnt understand that relationships are hard... they require work and hope. he gives up on us too easy.
i run outside with the thought of ""just keep walking"". but he stops me.
we cry.
i dont know if their was anything we ccould have done but cry and hold eachother.
i dont want to loose him. i can't imagine my life without him. he makes everyday just that little bit more happier.
it might not work out. and we both have our doubts..
but we decided to try... theres no way we couldnt. no way i could have just let him go. pride, self, money, anger... nothing matters anymore, i let it all go... just that i can't live without him.

----- Happiness is only real when shared -----

when we go to Canada . i don't know if i will be coming back for a long time.

because i want to feel at least once what he felt. even for a second. how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong, but to feel strong in human life's most primitive circumstances.


this is what i now believe to be of moral importance. to never bewilder in societies inevitable struggle to become more and more desolate, isolated, un-emotional and meterialistic.


see the movie. it will change your life and leave you for dead."

"event","so something pretty big happened over the weekend..

three things.

1: sean asked me if i would like to live together when we get back from canadia.... i said yes but their are many dilemmas in the way and nothing is certain (comlications with living situations etc).. i mean he might even just have to move into my room. *SHRUGS* . but i have to say it was amazing... and my heart completely stopped.

2: secondly, before this happened... about 2 day before.. i had an epiphany. we sat watching AEONFLUX (a really weird future movie with some really hot girl in it)... the ending was simple.. happy, all about truly living life. and knowing that your meant to be together. when it finished i went and sat on his lap, told him i loved him and smiled, truly for the first time in my ENTIRE life.. i knew i could be perfectly happy being with him for a very long time and having a life with him. i wasnt at all scared . i didnt say it... but he knew... and he felt even more-so. he started crying, just because i gave him my love. it was weird at first.. iv never had someone cry over me. but then i realised it was the nicest thing anybody has ever given me... annnnd ill stop rambling now..

ANYWAYS..

3: iv let go of some anger, gained some. come to terms with things.. and planned my life for the next 2 years. iv finally got everything sorted out.. and im pretty happy about that.

so here goes...

im going back to uni mext semester... BUT i only have to go on mondays.. so if anyone can get me a full time job PLEASE PLEASE help!.
going to candia to visit seans perents... we leave on the 4th of january - im quiting my job becasue HMV ARE SELL OUTS!!! we get back on the 9th of feb  -  only a month :D
should be fun.. ill always be wearing at least 6 layers. and it will be all squishy.. i need to eat snow... NEED TO... pee in it... NEED TO lay in itand make snow angels.. YAY

love, friends, uni & work are my main objectives.

then in 10 months we are going back to canadia to wokr their with chelle and timbo. we will all be living together. and im so friggin excited. :D :D :D i could pee.

however,
on the bad/good side... im loosing some very important friends this year. all going off on their adventures... i guess i started the trend or something.. ahha. jks. but i can't help but thing ill be missing picnics, drunken fairy rides and govinda dancing for a couple of months... as well as ben and libbies overly-sarcastic sense of humour which i love so much.. and just there love. all shall be missed.


that is all.. i shall post xavier rudd pictures later...

im not too sure what has come over me but the last week ive kinda turned back into myself. im more happy and fun and have lots of energy. which is good... i thin talking to people and seeing many faces has helped (thank JOEY!!!&lt;3)
i think i understand now.
and even though it will take time, for the moment im willing to sacrifice because im happy to be in love.. im in love with him.. completely.
this is the truth and if that means i must be the bigger person and put his feelings infront of mine then i will..
im happy&nbsp; with him.. the last two day would have to be the best days iv ever had since ive got back and i think thats because ive balanced everything now. friends. work. sean. family.
its all coming together.
i hope we stay like this. 7 months on (i think) and we still look at eachother the same... like we'll never let go
oh its so sappy and crappy. lol
anyways enough blabbing.
i feel rrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaaallllllllly sick.. my ear hurts, my stomach and feel like throwing up.
i hope nothing goes wronge when im in canada.

so its really confusing.
maybe im just trying o create drama because im bored.
but i just dont know.
you dont seem to look at me the same. or want me the same.
i need to miss you, but i hate doing that.
it feels like im putting more ffort en enthusiasm into this than you.

but...
then joey tell me how much she can see that you love me.
then you smile and hold me and sigh in content and tell me you love me.. and these are the times when i know i could never let you go.
when we are driving in silence and all you do is put your hand on my leg and then i lean over and wrap my arms around your body while uou drive. i listen to your heart beat. its so pretty..

i can't stare at you for too long or a feel like my heart will jump out and do a dance and song number.
when i hear your breath next to my ear i feel like bottling it up and keeping it next to my ears forever, the only thing i want to hear.
i know we havent had much time apart. but please know that its because i realised im not afraid of loving you. of giving you my everything. (except that little peice thats just for me).
i hope you never let go. it would probably be the hardest thing i could ever do.
please be happy.

"event","im back from my trip!.
so many stories to tell. so many faces i have seen. so many things i have smelled and touched.
its been a while but im finally at peace.
this whole week has been spent catching up with friends and sean never leaving my side.
its amazing how much more i love and apreciate him, even sleeping next to him is the most wonderful feeling ever.
it was scary being so alone, meeting so many new people. but i got a flow and stuck with it.
my family in croatia is just amazing, flaws and all. they are so welcoming and loving and giving.
its all too much to write my whole trip in this little page, so i guess you will just have to come and visit me to find out the gossss.
anyways my week was mostly spent down at byron bay where sean took me on a romantic 3 night stay. i love byron. i told everyone overseas about it becasue they kept asking me what my favourite plce was, they expected a reply like 'paris' (which it comes in very close) but instead i said byron bay... they didnt know what i was talking about so they just offered me more food.
so much learnt, family history, wars, loves, deaths. i guess seeing all this by myself did make me more observant - which i have figured out is somehwat of a bad thing because now i realise how sad this world really is... i guess you could say i lost some hope in humanity. which is a really REALLY bad thing to happy nowdays. hopefully being around my loved ones again i will surely get it back quickly.

anyways also in other news, apart from my return home, im heading off again!... HAHAH.. yeh im going to canada in january - but just for a month!. with sean to meet the folks and see snow and eat it!... and go to seattle where eddie vedder lives!!! ahah.. the birthplace of grunge. anyways it will be a delight.

ill see you all veyr soon.&nbsp; too much to say... just too much to tell

theres only so many words that can express its beauty - actually i'd say non.
i sat there in this city oozing with love and watched the bright lights.
this is where i broke. i cried. not only was it the most beautiful thing i've every seen - but being around all this love and romance should b uplifting ... but i realised that comming here without sean was a bad idea..
i cried for its beauty and its loneliness... my loneliness.
i hope im not loosing any love, im still hanging on.
but this city made me forget. this city made me realise that when i get back - it might be over.
but at times like this - when i actually say it to myself.. my heart stops and i loose my breath - like i will die.

i shouldnt have come here without him.
not to paris.
not to this love.

never again.. never without him.

i will keep my love. i will hold it tight.. and i will breath this air so i can take it back with me.

"event","my heart has pushed every feeling down...
every feeling has been locked away and i hope i get it back.. this is what iwas talking about, what iw as so terrified of.
im trying no to forget my home but this place is becoming more real by the second..
i think i miss him.. i believe i do. but why dont i feel that sad, hollow wound in my chest.. that was there when i first arrived in london?.. why has it gone..?
i guess its a good thing in the respect that i appreciate where i am now. i ahve no problem staying here at all. but i dont want to forget.. why is my heart forgetting? now im scared that i wont want the same things when i come back. i can still feel them there.. in their small box that my mind has shoved them into and locked. they are squarming to get out. i hope i can release them. i hope they dont give up and fad away. i dont want to love it so much here without anybody... bt then again i guess its my mood right now.. im content.. and i dont miss anythign really that much.. at this very second...
i guess it will come back. it has to eventually. right?
this is the weirdest post ive ever written."

"event","okay so things arnt solved but im okay now... 
and this is becasue i went to the pub and had 2 and a half pi...pin... huge cups of guiness.
and it made me happy. and the guy that owned the bar was from western australia - he was so cute. and if i was single... i would have jumped him. but at that very second i looked at my phone and saw the photo of me and sean. and i realised i really didnt want to jump him.. it made me happy!..

anyways so yeh things are calmer now.. i had a breakdown but its O.K people!..

doesnt excuse the fact that i still want to just sleep in my own bed.. around my own things and my family ... and with sean keeping me warm.

he replied to my letter i wrote him.. it made me cry the ahppiest tears ive ever cried before. 
tehehe.. anyways i smell like pub and booze.. SHOWER TIME!

love and miss."

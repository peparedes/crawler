A cascade of endless emotion.
It cuts through your soul like an eagle's through the crisp mountain air.
Ignoring everything but visits from the wind that gusts to and fro.
Feel it contour to your face as it hews itself into your face little by little.
Like a long shadow that drips from mirrors that sees all but reflect everything it feels.
They'll haunt you for the rest of your life.
It's your curse. 
Bear it like stones cast upon thee.
You'll grow stronger.
Wounds will heal.
You'll forget to remember.
Watch as it all falls to the earth."

"event","Dear Heather,
           
                 
	How do I put this... I care about you. Think what you will but, I've never loved anyone more then you. From what you've endured during this past year is remarkable and for lack of a better word honorable. You are an amazing woman. Trudging through life with more chains attached to your heart then any average person, yet you pass all in the ways of love and life. Every time I look at you, your luminous eyes you etch yourself deeper into my heart. You have pushed passed feelings, emotion, friends, family, love to something not many find. You think yourself weak and yet you give more to the weak of heart and mind more then any other. You radiate from your soul. The impassable outer layer in which it protects your beauty. Which no man or woman could ever touch. Knowing these words are not deserving of you and by far the most notable your eyes have every felt, I recoil to a sad place I wish not to be. Not undeserving, but not loved by either of us.
	When I look into our future I see a beautiful satin blanket safeguarding our future. It is easily stained by lies, hate, mistrust, but if we can pass it to our future I know it will be far worth it. I love you. Yes. Probably a word though up by a fool but has captured the hearts of so many as well as mine. So I do love you. More with each passing glance of your beauty. It hides itself in  a place where its hard for me to show you. deep in the cavernous reaches of my heart where many pains lie now. some by my choice and some not so.
	 I'm not asking you to reach out to these words and question them but let them find you and settle into your mind without protest. Let them fall like a unrolled blanket falling into place over a persons body. Finding it's place by touch and not pulled into place. Please. I love you. 
	When we are not as one I miss you as the Moon would miss the Earth and the Earth the Sun. Without you there would be no place to cast a shadow upon to give value to anything. Nor would there be any light to give haste to fleeting shadows to portrayal beauty. My life would be a world in limbo between darkness and light, not having the privilege to see either. I would rather wander the underworld blind and deaf, rather then be with the living and knowing I lost the gift of your touch. So I beg you. Please never recoil your love. I don't mean to give reason to. I am what I am but what I am is not set it stone. That's the best part about love. So once again I beg you. Give this piece of stone a chance to be shaped and polished into what it was before it was broken. And I pray you accept it once again.

										
																Yours for eternity,
																                     Ian"

Let your fingers sink into the muddy clay.
Lay your head into the dirty cradle.
The rain runs down your face.
It drips off the end of your nose.
Leaving the ends of your hair.
Waving goodbye.
He was your friend.
He was once part of you.
The only part of you that will be something.
It disappears into the ground below.
Where are you going to go?
Just fade away you fool.
Slide down to the ground and look up.
Nothing.
Just black.
Home.
It's up to your ankles.
It's all the same.
Emptiness envelopes you.
Just relax.
It could be soon over... Maybe.
The pain could end?
The loneliness soon won't sting you anymore. 
It's around your waist now.
close your eyes.
Remember.
They're all discordant memories of what you could have been.
You're no different.
You absolutely love wallowing.
Go ahead.
Give up.
Let it come up around your neck.
Let it's thought full your ears.
Be a fool.
Let it slip away.
Not hearing anything.
Just it.
The hidden face of death filling your lungs.
It comes in so many different forms.
Throw up.
Death turns bloody red.
What brings life, now brings death.
A weightless, empty life now awaits you.
You deserve it."

I sat there toinght.
In my cage. 
Looking through the bars that I strenghtened with lies.
I forged with deceit.
My bars.
I felt a tear fall from my face.
Free to fall.
I wish she was able to wipe it away.
I know she couldn't.
Even alone.
I need her there for that.
But instead I stepped back into my cage where no one could touch me.
Where she couldn't see the real me.
The one that hates the cage I built.
I don't want the thing near me.
I want it destroyed.
The floor of it is so cold.
I don't know if it's the steel or all of my frozen tears.
The top of it leaks.
She sits atop on it and cries.
They all drain down to me.
Every tear that hits me is a reminder that I did this.
Everything is a reminder...
Constant.
Painful.
Everlasting.
I want to feel her arms wrap around me again.
Come into the light you fool.
Come out of there.

"event","Letting everything go that mattered.
Dwelling on everything you chose to ruin.
I am everything you hate. 
Just in  a different mold.
Dissapointments in others, done by the angry mind.
It's all gone.
Trust doesn't exist.
Missing the one you pushed away.
Being lost and not knowing how to explain it.
Sleeping in a bed of tears is the only way.
If you can't cry,you can't sleep toinght.
A drowing desire to care for anything.
Make yourself miserable.
No one elses.
Was promised to you that things would stay the same.
Not being able to ask you to care.
To love.
To trust ever again.
It can't be done.
Just wanting to see you now.
Everything seems unatainable.
Losing everyone you know in one swift movement.
After all of this.
How do you show it's not their fault.
It's your problem.
Damn myself for letting you love me.
I didn't know I would do this.
That's why I force my love onto you.
Sick. 
Dead inside.
An empty shell.
Words mean nothing to her anymore.
Would the first sentence be remmeber by the time this one is read?
Are the little things forgetten by her?
My life. My pain. My end.
It starts with you and ends with me.
We're not together?
Some things in minds do not compute.
Wasn't it okay, for one brief moment or another.
Casting off all worries for but a second can make the world seem right.
Until reality of pain reers its ugly head.
How many hearts have faded in this same situation.
Loving so much but hurting too much to show it.
How much will it hurt to try knowing what one did.
Looking back on your words one said to me.
With undying love.
A innocent heart.
Then the most wonderful thing ever.
Now they cut like a knife.
Now I understand why my words are gone.
Shredded into a forgotten memory.
Deep down they still mean everything they once did.
To be able to express your feelings without fear.
Never to be again.
It used to be done without thought. 
Now is a carefully planned out idea.
Why won't you call back!?
Pain flows like a river in my heart.
Pumping to every region of my body.
Constantly reminding ones self of the mistakes that no one will ever forget.
Eyes looking at you.
Judging every move you make.
It's your own fault.
You did this to yourself.
You don't deserve to have anyone.
For them to hear you cry.
To hear your pain can never be asked.
Let them watch you float away to unforgiving seas where you belong.
Wish they were happy without you.
While you rot in you cage alone.
Blistered hands running up and down the bars.
Comforting numbing pain is your only friend.
It befriended you.
You welcome it now.
It's all you know.
Before it was a guiding light.
You didn't accept that.
Greed.
Go away...
Go away...
GO AWAY!
You don't deserve anything.
Give your last shred of feelings.
Offer your last ounce of love.
Let happiness fade from your heart.
Let it die.
Let it rot.
Why are you still here!?
Don't do this to her anymore.
Show her.
Let her know.
Let her believe again.
Let her in.
Let her love.
With the change of season, let everything blossem again.
Strive on.
Moving forwards to attain what is backwards.
Stop giving up on yourself!
Become what you once were.
Forgetting all else.
The final steps to secure life.
Secure eternal happiness.
They are few and far between.
You hurt everyone that ever loved you!
I love you.
So god damn much.
Stop letting everything go.

Riding over your skin like fingers over glass.
Nothing to slow it down.
Flowing like a weeping waterfall.
Clad in pain the sky is no more.
It is not immortal.
It dies and leaves eternity gazing down upon you.
Amounting to everything and yet meaning so little.
It all depends on who cares.
They care.
As they rip you apart.
Instinct.
Basic.
No blame but your own for living.
He looks at you.
But he is just another one flying over.
A glace into his eyes tells the tails of all of the other.
Un-judging, and nonchalant in the shredding of your being.
You become used to it.
You being to walk in it.
Pieces of yourself being left behind.
A chunk of skin there.
A piece of muscle there.
Comparing none to the loss of ones self inside.
Still you trudge on.
walking through the pain now.
You accept your life.
They have.
It ends.
You walk out alive.
You just had to recognize it was the past.
Knowing what effect it has on you, you learn and forget some things.
It will surface when you need it to.
If you want it sooner, you'll have to fail.
You turn and watch the sea move over you.
You shed a tear.
It almost seemed like that's all you knew.
You turn around and walk back towards the darkness.
You have accepted the shroud as your protection.
At least you understood that pain."

Growing wings but so useless, the sky will never accept you. You will never fly.

All that was once known no longer exists. Fables become all that is known and why is no longer a question. What was lost is gone and will never be, but one thing remains unscathed by time and death. One thing that holds true and only arises to a new plateau every time it is threatened. It's a utopia surrounded by chaos and terror through a crystal looking glass. A shield that can only be carried and forged by two of the same heart and mind. I look into your eyes during the apex of the maelstrom and shed a tear because even behind paper walls, nothing can change the way I feel. Time is a frozen aspect of life when it is spent loving her. Undying and eternally blessed to belong to you; my heart is your and yours, mine."

You look out as you are surrounded by unimaginable beauty but just before that, a thin layer of impenetrable shadows. No use to breath. It makes everything smaller. Everything grows more darker by the day as your world grows smaller and full of more desire. The Richness of what could be haunts you as you look from your cell, thinking 'Is there a way?' The harder you try the more unreachable it becomes. Sweat runs down your brow and drips off of your nose, falling eternally downward, never to reach your loved ones shoulder. It falls forever like your spirit. Descending into the unknown where the only tragedy and hope resides. You lean forward and put your hands on the bars but they only move away from you. You can't even touch what keeps you from living. The cage is not living. It's a self imposed reality that has taken form and is concrete but not tangible. You'll never be able to touch what confines you. The further away everything gets, the more you see. Dreams become too vivid to ignore so the thought passes your mind that you can make it a better life. By now you have already lost. You have now given everything to the reaper, but even he doesn't want your soul. It will forever rot in the eternal damnation that you created. you can pray, but if death doesn't want you, than why would He?"

This was my last attempt at sharing my life with someone else. I'll never try again. 'Sure you'd get over it she says.' No. I love you and that is all I have room in my heart for. I pushed everything to the edge and now it's comming back at me. I know my limits with Her, so i'll just be careful not to ruin what time I have left with Her before she leaves me. I don't know when, but I know when I leave this province, she leaves my life. I thoguht at first she would try to stay with me, without growing resentful towards me for leaveing, but I don't think she will. Her growing 'weird' towards me is okay, but not leaving me. If you love someone, ether you are with them or not it still hurts all the same to my heart. She said she would find peace in knowing she wasn't with me if I was gone, and once she does that I don't think  i'll ever get her back. I could wait 6 months, but mind you, i'm no prized pig. She's amazing. She'll be swept up in no time. I'm easy to forget, I know. A few months of someones life in yours, sure it sounds easy to forget, but not for me. I told her forever and I met it. I don't even know if she loves me right now. I asked her if she was still attracted to me (which is like comparing a rare and beautiful flower to  a tumbleweed) and if she loved me and she said 'I think so.' That broke my heart wether she met it to or not. I know she has her problems and she's confused so I know she doesn't mean to. So it's okay. Whatever is best with her. It's just now... I don't think the best for her will be me a few years down the road. I had everything planned... I knew exactly where I wanted to propose and everything. Kid of sad but too late now. Than she lost intrest in where I wanted to go to ask Her to marry me. Said 'what's the point.' and than I cried that night for a while. Would going back and never making all of the mistakes I made help anything, or was it fated like this. The Gods must hate me. It would be like aphrodite herself loving you and than her walking away from you a year later after she made you feel like you knew love better than Eros. After that, what's the point of love. Sure I could find someone else, but why? To hell with that thought. I choose lonliness. Remembering the love she once gave me. It's 12:30 now... I wonder if she'll get up to say goodbye to me before I leave to go home for the week. I thought this morning, 'Hey, it's sunday. Maybe she'll let me hold her for a while', but lo-and-behold she gave me that same old look she does every morning I try. So I won't ever again until she does first. She wonders why I cry when she holds me... Because I wait every second of my waking life for her to hold me, kiss me, smile at me, say she loves me. It's what I live for... So once it ends... What's there to enjoy. Just live life hopeing someday she'll want to talk to me again. I'll forget that fact that she'd ever go back out with me again after she left once, so i'll just hope she may let me talk to her afterwards. I should have been more careful who I gave my heart to, I think sometimes, but than I realize that, there coud never have been a better person to keep it safe for me than Her. What would it have been like to have her love me forever, Magical. Unsermountable joy, but now i'll never know. Only dream forever in the vast sea of lonliness, with others who thoguht they were in love. I wasn't enough for her, I guess, but at least i'll have Her until than. I don't even tink stay will help me now. She has amazing friends... She doesn't need me. I checked her bookmarks to niotice one of My Spaces were deleted when she cleaned her PC last night. So I guess all of those thoughts are dead now. I remember when we first started out she took a lot of chances with me, she told me last night she lied to herself, at first, to try to give it a chance. I just tink now she gave herself such  a great lie she belived it and now she's finding out i'm not the one anymore for her. How horrible is it to find out the one for you isn't the one for the other. I'm going to just go sit on the floor and look at her... Hold back the tears so she knows nothing is wrong (Because i'm tired of crying in front of her, I ruin everything.) and when she opens her eyes. if they gaze upon me i'll tell her I love her and be prepared to have the cold sting of fate in knowing she won't say it back. Goodbye...unless something changes I don't think i'll ever write in this again, unless she thinks sometihng is wrong by me not writing. I love her, Forever & Eternally."

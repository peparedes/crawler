"event","I am cold, tired and sick. Sick with mourning and putting on mourning airs. Mourning sickness? I am so funny. It is other peoples' misery that makes the best comedy and as such I never like to be the one to make you laugh. 

I've made bad decisions and been abandoned. Back at square one, smoking indoors, the place I can really enjoy it but rarely do these days. I was so tired earlier but digestion causes bad dreams. It's Saturday night and while I should be sleeping I am awake. It's Saturday and I am overlooked and gone, with all of my distortion. I long to be out of here, out of mind for myself but not for others out of place, whether it be by sleep or drink, this girl needs something. 

I know the something I need but I refuse to call it by name, I refuse to call upon it. I am always so cold, perhaps the insides have something to do with what is manifested on the outside. Does that mean I am warm always when I am full of love and warmth and in good company? Perhaps. It's all a front anyway. I'm not happy like you think but I am crazy like you believe. 

We are all judged by our emotions. 
Crucified by our neuroses. 

Contemplation is all I have to curl up with tonight. Alone with myself, which is fine, but I'd rather be alone with a bottle of wine, with a lot of time. With someone who had a lot of problems so I'd never have time to breathe or to think about mine. I keep listening to what I made and what I gave. I thought it was different but I am more wise than I originally gave myself credit for. It's all a monotonous blur now and I find it incredibly stupid to grieve for trivial things that were never there to begin with. I grieve now for things imagined but never materialised. Ideals were meant to be strived for and lived up to, not to create seamless disappointment with no stitch-rippers and way to fix. This elastic is too tight for me, and I will never be skin and bones enough to make it fit. 

<i>I can tell, I can tell, you regret the day that you fell.</i> 

You came like an angel and you fell away like a man-made. A man and a woman created you and I am regretful that they did so. One more cigarette and I am done, just like you are done, just like I knew you would be. Perhaps it's intrinsic in me. Manifestation is a powerful thing. One has to wonder if it is so powerful why we can only use it to make ourselves sick rather than manifesting desire or success just because we believe it. 

Big secret: no one believes in success. We are all faithless wanderers seeking a beacon in the dark and falling apart when we realise the only light we have to work with is the one shining from within. In the end it's funny how something this inspirational and all-realising can be so depressing and it's even stranger how quickly the time passes when you're not here. The waiting is supposed to drive people mad, but the hope is what keeps the seconds ticking by until the moment comes when I can touch you and bathe in your warmth and let all of these cold doubts be cradled into something more. Never known a child to come out right in the burdens of negligence, never known Thandie Newton the way I know now. Stop teasing now. I understand my mistake. I want to grow flowers in your heart of stone... I want where you are to be the place I call home. 

It's going to be a long way home. 

<i>I got it sleeping rough on the streets in the rain 
I got it learning to share my peoples' pain
I got it making flowers grow in hearts of stone
I got it 'cos I always took the long way home... </i>

"event","Trace the tops, seal the skin, searing... tracing lines all in good time
The lights, the tracers, just barely touching and blowing in the breeze 
Your arms, my face and the glistening, the waiting
My stomach cramps with all of the available possibilities. 

I'm feeling disgustingly poetic right now, and it's really unnerving. It's funny what sort of effects your mentality have on your health. I don't even feel like that makes any sense; I stopped speaking proper English ages ago anyway. I feel like there's something I need to say and yet here I am with bated breath, not saying it. 

I promised myself I would take more risks and shout things from the rooftops, and here I am with stitched lips. So many things bring up so many new thoughts that feel so old, and as I look at things that I didn't understand in the past, I understand them so much better now and I wonder what's changed. I can't believe that I was ever naive enough not to pick up on subtle things that seem so obvious, but the more that I think about it, the more that's the case. 

I'm reading Cosmo and things that seemed like second-nature now seem foreign and beg to be discovered. People tire so quickly of my novelty and I hate it. Not to say there was much novelty to begin with, but it still irritates me. It angers me, also, that I can't keep promises to myself or trains of thought on track. 

No caffeine, I said, and here I am clutching at a Coca-Cola. 
No nicotine, I said. I even made plans to quit with a partner so it would be easier. And here I am with a fresh pack of cloves because my first night as a recycled raver had to be done clutching bits of my old cynical self. 

Some things are too intense for me to be dealing with. I'm proud of myself for having kept up on one vow: no sex. I shouldn't flatter myself being so proud because I know that if I didn't have the health problems that I have, I probably would have broken that one too, but then I have to consider how else I've been feeling lately. Emotionally, I'm not prepared for it, either. It seems so strange and done, like I'm over it and will never share the experience again. 

I no longer get lusty, I only get butterflies. Not the fuck-me butterflies, but the sixth-grade study hall butterflies. Instead of swooning and putting on my bedroom eyes when I come across a lovely specimen, I sit and watch, breathless. I look away. I never smile. I may even act like I hate them, if only just a bit. 

Nicole once told me that she'd never smoke, but that whenever she saw me smoking, that it made her want one, and that I looked glamorous. She said she could see me doing it for the rest of my life, and even as a child, it somehow felt natural to me. Now there's this new part of me that says I should quit and I feel like I could cry about it. Not because I crave the cigarettes or anything like that, but because I will no longer have the accessory. Sure, I'll still have my red lipstick, but what kind of dame dares to wear red lipstick and not have a cancer stick to go along with it? What will I do with my hands while I'm driving? What will occupy the other hand when I have a champagne bottle's neck in my left? 

Is smoking part of my identity? True, I could put my right arm around someone while I'm drinking and cancel out the cancer stick, but people only stay put for so long. I have a lot more faith in inanimate things that can be gotten rid of just as fast as they can be obtained. I feel like it's a crisis. I don't think about what I'm going to do with my time, smoking isn't a habit that is done in the house, or in other peoples' houses. It's not something I do when I wake up. It's something done on the town. 

It's to me like matching shoes and a nice purse are to some women. It's a defense mechanism, it's my friend, and furthermore, it's socially acceptable. If I stood around outside of places by myself and carried a razor between my fingers, and cut little chunks out of my arm, it would raise pause. However, standing alone puffing on a cigarette seems perfectly normal, hence, cloves as friends. If you're busy doing that, you don't need anywhere to go, anyone to talk to. 

It reminds me of Sam Neill; my friend met him outside of a boy named Pip's house. Sam is Pip's godfather or something like that, and my friend was celebrating some occasion with Pip, his friends, and his family. He happened upon Sam outside of the house, smoking under a porch-light. 

My friend approached him and made a remark about the cigarette, though what it was escapes me now, to which Sam replied, ""Oh no. I only smoke socially."" 

That KILLS me. Standing outside, BY HIMSELF, smoking, and he <i>only</i> does it socially. Celebrities and any other beings who dare to be eccentric are what life is all about. 

I do it by myself, I do it with other people, I do it at parties, I do it in my car, I do it at concerts, clubs [though not in America], raves, other peoples' cars, coffeeshops, by the sea, in the streets of Los Angeles. 

Maybe I'm just too neurotic for my own good, though it brings to mind the whole 'idle hands do the devil's work' philosophy. Considering that smoking is a 'vice', perhaps the fact that my hands have any time to be idle at all is the problem. 

What else do I do with my hands in my free time? I post. Livejournal has been described as the devil's playground, and you can't stop doing something without adopting something new. Ever tried to tape someone's hands down while they're telling a story? I guarantee you that they either won't be able to do it, or it will take them about ten times longer than it normally would. We all have our quirks. If I tried replacing smoking with posting, not only would it cause about a thousand car accidents, but I'm sure I'd be one of the most hated figures in all the land of livejournal simply because of the volume of insidious content that I put out. 

When I started smoking, I stopped cutting. Cutting seems like a stupid, antiquated notion now, and I wonder what I ever saw in it. That's not to say that doing it again doesn't cross my mind; it does. However, it's a fleeting thought, and it doesn't nag at my brain like it used to until I did it. 

That's how the smoking is for me now. If I could only find something simple and convenient, and something that would fit in all the old places. Simple enough to be done almost anywhere, but complex enough to hold my interest. 

Smoking: you light, you suck, you ash, you watch it disappear, you re-light, you ash more, you stamp it out. It seems like a lot, but it can be done almost any time and anywhere. Sometimes you burn yourself. 

Blow Pops [what I used as a substitute for smoking in happier times]: You open it, you lick it, you lick it, you lick it, you bite it, you try to get all of the gum off of the stick, you chew the gum, you throw away the stick, the gum loses it's flavour and you throw it away.  Sometimes you cut up your tongue and you swallow a bunch of your blood. 

Razorblades/Broken Glass: You drag them along your skin, you watch yourself bleed, you sop up the carnage with a towel or something, you let the blood clot, you pick it, you shower, you get the train-tracks.  

<center><b><i>Alternatives: </i></b></center>

Text messaging -- costly, yet effective. Maximum hand occupation, but not good while driving or doing really anything where you have to use your eyes. Also requires a cellular phone. 

Drawing on oneself -- messy, requires Sharpie or Bic, commonly looks tacky and trashy, and cannot be done while driving, nor in most social situations without people thinking you're insane. 

Cracking knuckles -- Good hand occupation, however, the joints will only pop so many times before you have to wait an hour or so to have another go at them, and in this time you may well light up another cigarette. Wonderful while driving. 

Singing -- This has nothing to do with your hands, but it gives you something to concentrate on, but most of the time can only be done in private. 

<center><b><i>Conclusion:</i></b></center>

There really is no alternative for someone like me who needs constant busy work for hands and mouth. Do I accept this fate, or torture myself for months trying to get back into another habit, the kind where I try my best not to have a fit when my hands and mouth are completely still, or do I betray Lib and myself, and spend the rest of my days as I am now, and as many people approve? 

We'll see what the doctor says. If I have cancer, I may be forced to stop, but until then, I'll keep wearing my red lipstick and my tall shoes and my 'alternative' clothing, and live up to my stereotype. 

I guess I've got some phone calls to make, and it's funny, I began this post with a completely different objective than to talk about smoking, I wanted to talk about the goings-on in my heart as of late, but things shifted fast. 

It's funny what guilt can do to your mind. It makes the only thing you're not supposed to be doing, or not supposed to have done, the only thing that is in your head. 

<lj-cut text=""Funny what the only thing in my head has been lately ;)"">

I've been having bad dreams every single night. I had a dream that I vomited on my brother's head and he didn't even care. 

That's my greatest fear, and recurs in all of my bad dreams; I'm screaming at the top of my lungs, but not making any noise. No ripples in the water, no one can hear me, I can barely hear me, and people need to hear. Or there's the worse ones where people hear me but they don't take me seriously until it's too late. My stomach ties itself into knots in those dreams, just thinking about those dreams, and I wake up shrieking ""I TOLD YOU SO!!"" 

I say that a lot. No one ever listens to me until something bad happens, and because I've been trying to get them to understand something that could have prevented it, I don't even have the strength to SAY ""I told you so"". I think that perhaps in a past life I was someone who fortold the future to whom no one would listen until their village burned to the ground.

"event","Dear [undisclosed-recipient] 

My name is Katie, as you well know. I am 19 years old and I really want to kiss you. When I think of you my heart starts to beat faster with all of the possibility that lay ahead for someone like you and for someone like me. I should not think thoughts like these because it is very likely that you are pre-occupied with another female [if not another male] and I am occupied myself. There is someone in my life who is very giving and loves me very much and I really appreciate him. If I need to be alone, he leaves me that way, and if I need a friend he is there. He is quite the catch, and yet here I am being immature and straying from my path. 

The sunshine is a peculiar thing, I both love it and hate it. I hate how bright it is but I like the way it lights up everything that occurs in nature. Then, there is the question of how it feels. Upon emerging from my freezing house, it is nice, wonderful. It warms my skin and reminds me that things get better. This warmth reminds me of you. When I am sitting in my car in the sunshine with my music up full-blast, hot and sticky because of the dry heat of summer, I sometimes catch myself checking my lipstick. I want to look perfect in case I see you. The hot, sticky feeling of sitting in the sunshine is also associated with you. I know you know this feeling. It is the same feeling, the one of well-being after you spend a night teaching a lover the meaning of endurance, the same kind of jittery heat that you feel when something nerve-wracking is over, or when something exciting is just beginning. 

Try as I might, I cannot get you out of my head, and I would gladly accept many terrible fates before admitting that I feel this way about you, but I have to get it out there. People have to know. It is extremely doubtful you'll ever read this, unless you have friends on the inside, or are super-crafty with the search engine, but as far as I know, being online is a miniscule part of your life, if at all. 

I'd like to take you on and see if you could teach me the true meaning of appreciation and I want to know your character. Mostly I want to look into your eyes and taste the lips I never had before. However, until there is absence of love and freedom of feeling, I am confined to writing you these wretched letters that you'll most likely never see. Perhaps, however, it's a nice sensation, if you are the type that is down with vibes, to feel someone longing for you, even if it <i>is</i> someone as screwed up as I am. It could be sweet.

"event","I'm going to get a part-time job. Nothing fancy. I have four months to save up about $1,000. Then, in July, I'm flying off to Brooklyn. As much as I despise the idea, maybe I'll find myself there. I need to find money for a pack of smokes in the meantime... and tonight, dinner at the Olive Garden, though I'm not hungry at all. And though I'm not paying. 

I never pay for anything anymore. It's like some strange alternate universe where I have this great life, I'm always going places, doing things. I've been to Europe, I'll be bi-coastal in July. I'm going and going, and you'd think I'd be flying high because of it. 

But in reality, I'm just exhausted. I'm too young to be old, and I'm too old to be young. 

Brooklyn will give me something to raise my glass for, and to look forward to. And for the next two weeks, I will be in Benicia at a house we like to pretend is ours, getting drunk out of my mind and spending my days in a hot tub that gives Jessica a rash, and feeding dogs. We will play Native American music on the stereo, and all will be well in the world. 

Happiness is never having to calm down.
Love is Jones Soda.
Life is a highway. 
The theif carries the biggest safe.

Certain things really aren't supposed to hurt this much. It is not supposed to make me sad when I think of my days as a raver. Listening to a song by VNV Nation which I had never heard 1.5 months ago, and its ability to make me cry is absolutely insane. 

I added a lady from Vallejo who is a gothy parent to <lj user=""nicefuckingtree"">'s list today... I had to resist every urge in my body to ask her if she goes to Death Guild. I find that my words are little more than useless jumble at this point. Broken English, and all. This is a sad way to start things...

I have a urinary tract infection, <i>again.</i> It hurts like a motherfucker. I am drinking lots of cranberry juice and waiting for the carpet-layers to get out of the bathroom so I can try to piss in peace. The Uristat doesn't do it for me anymore. My only condolence is that once the burning feeling goes away when I pee... the pee is orange from the Uristat. Bright orange. <i>Like fire</i>.

It's funny that I don't want anyone to know that as long as I'm sick, I will have an orange vagina. But if I truly didn't want anyone to know, why would I put it on livejournal, all unlocked? It makes no sense. I suppose I really have no secrets. Everyone finds out everything eventually.

I like how the cold turns things hard. 

Supposed to hang out with Will tonight. Speculative plans or whatever. Won't call him. Doubt he'll call me. Can't go anywhere else. Trapped. Longing.

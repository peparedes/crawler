.... Yeah, pretty much.

Oh, people interested in playing with me on WoW:
Alliance:
        - Kilrogg server, I play a female Draenei paladin named WiccanK
Horde:
        - Kilrogg server, I play a female Blood Elf paladin named Frozenbara
        - Auchindon server, I play a male Blood Elf rogue named TomShepherd

Anyone that wants to play and NOT join either of those two servers, let me know where you are and what you need =3= I'm flexible, but if it's not a pally or a rogue, I'll be a totally newbie to that class! D:"

"event","Uwah, my Celtic Woman dvd is so awesome =3=; I wanted to listen to it after a discussion of Suikoden with someone I know. Lots of the earlier music in Suikoden reminds me a lot of Irish songs X3; 

Anyhoo~ People at my job are still waiting for me to get bored of my Wii. NEVAR. After all, Samurai Warriors Katana is still coming out! And after the debaucle that will be Dynasty Warriors 6... I need something that will keep the game alive.

So... because we had a big sale at the store, I finally bought Final Fantasy X and X-2. Bad games, really, but I figure... I can handle putting down, like, $15 to buy both, right? I'm actually a good way through X, but... the directing for the voice acting was terrible -A- And the storyline wasn't exactly interesting. And X-2 is just bad... It's nothing but a game for eye-candy; definitely not a Final Fantasy, I think. Of course, I don't really like Yuna so much, and she's the main character..... (It's like Wild Arms 1, where you can only use the three main characters. I like the remake better, where you have six to choose from!)

However, I do really like playing Final Fanatasy III. The character designs are cute 8) And, of course, I may be one of the only people left in the world that likes games where you all stand in a line and attack in an order. D< I think the 'live-action' gaming is over-rated. It's just a bunch of melee! Not that melee is a bad thing - for MMO type games, I'm all for melee, you know? But very few games with the whole real time battle system have appealed to me over all.... I mean, I like Devil Summoner, but I would rather have the battle system from Nocturne or Digital Devil Saga..

I also have to figure out what Nobunaga's Ambition is.... Uhm, I reserved it with no idea what in the world it is! DX; It's by Koei, so... like... it should be something like either Kessen or Samurai Warriors.... Or maybe a combo of both X_x; Well, we'll see!"

I've been popping between Guitar Hero and Gyakuten Saiban :O One of my coworkers said that Mitsurugi bites the big one in this game, but I don't know if I believe it. -A-/) He was taking the word of someone who 'played' the original Japanese game, but... can't read any Japanese? It's possible, I suppose, but perhaps there was a mistake. If so... well... ;A; The next game doesn't star Ryuuichi ANYWAY, so Mitsurugi... haha, he probably ran off with Ryuuichi -3-/) Or the detective, Keisuke~

There are, of course, other games I want to play on the 360. The only thing holding me back is that I have absolutely positively no interest in multiplayer. None. And before anyone even says anything. NOHALO3. NONE. ZIP. 

The debate is for the Wii first, or the 360. ~x~ My beloved PS2 will probably go the way of the Gamecube and Xbox and be obsolete soon ;A; If I want a PS3, I have to get one of the backwards compatible 60 gig ones... ~___~ Now's the time to, I suppose... baaah!"

"event","Sandy Fox is taking over the voice acting world, and that is not a good thing D< 

She's now at least THREE characters in Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors combined. 

I just got Orochi Warriors yesterday, and have been playing pretty much non-stop. However, the game has 77 playable characters, and it feels like they're alllll being played by 9 or so different actors.

Now, don't get me wrong. Jiang Wei got a good voice, Lady Noh got a good voice this time (she sounds really sexy now, as opposed to the last game), Ginchiyo has a great voice as well. Some characters... I've gotten used to their voices over time: like Zhang He, I've just gotten used to his actor from hearing him all the time as Zhang He and Luke/Asch in Tales of the Abyss...

But I cannot get accustomed to Da Qiao/ Xiao Qiao /Xing Cai's voices. Xing Cai used to be really cute; I loved her dub voice. She sounded very demure and sweet, but at the same time, determined. Now, Xiao Qiao, her sister (not even twin) Da Qiao, and Xing Cai all sound the exact same - naggy, uncute, and painful. The Qiao sisters are supposed to be adorable, and very devoted, but I can't stand to play them because of their voices. 

Since Warriors Orochi allows you to play three character teams, maybe I'll put all three of them on the same team and kill my opponents with their talking UoU;

On the plus side, Lady Noh, Lu Xun, and Keiji Maeda (to name a few) got some voice upgrades. Lady Noh no longer sounds like a little kid trying to pretend she's sexy, Lu Xun sounds closer to his original voice of Kenji Nojima, and Keiji no longer sounds like a dopey surfer dude (DUDE!). 

All in all, it's pretty intriguing as a game. It feels like it'll be a lot shorter than the other games, even though it's supposed to be both combined. It's probably due to the fact that they have so many different characters they have to animate and provide alternate color palettes for... 

It's interesting to see which characters mention the fact that they're from different times and places. Sun Ce and Jiang Wei seem to be the only ones who mentioned it... And all the Chinese women like to mention that Ginchiyo is very unfeminine XD;; Zhang He also did it! He was like ""You're supposed to be a woman, right? Where's your sense of grace?"" and Ginchiyo was all ""And you're supposed to be a warrior. Where's your sense of masculinity"" 8D Ooh, ouch. Ginchiyo ftw.

Overall, it's nice to see the characters, even with the bad voice acting. I'm also disappointed with the fact that this is probably the last Warrior's game on the PS2. Sony, you traitor D8"

"event","Ha~ So, I horrified the people at work by declaring that I would borrow Dirge of Cerberus. They're like ""But it's BAD"" and I had to explain that I knew that, but I wanted to see just HOW bad it truly was. 

... and it is bad.

VERY BAD.

First off, that is the most user-unfriendly fight system I have EVER seen. NO ONE would think R1 to target, and then R1 again to shoot. And the right analog stick to aim. WHA? Inconceivable.

Oh, and all those Halo-esque soldiers listening to Yuffie in her short-shorts and godawful voice (we meet again, voice actress whose voice I cannot stand)... ALSO inconceivable.

This games does not even really feel like Final Fantasy 7. I've played the original FF7 so many times, and even *I* was confused at the world. I was like ""W-wait, where is this again??"" I don't recall the entire WORLD looking like Midgar, thanks. (And the Geraldo-like reporter woman... lol, all I could think of was his unveiling on national tv of.... NOTHING XD When in the world did the world of Final Fantasy 7 need investigative journalists after Midgar fell? XD I mean, REALLY?)

And then Vincent... First off, that voice. He sounds like a movie announcer. I'm really curious as to what his REAL voice is, because I can't imagine that voice actor as anyone except Tom from Toonami/Cartoon Network, or Gale from Digital Devil Saga. He's much too growl-y for Vincent in this (who, by the way, looks like some sort of rabid beast, instead of emo-goth)

Secondly, Vincent's all impressive in the movie, and then in the FMV... he suddenly becomes a complete moron. ""I'll do all these impressive moves and clearly have some sort of insight into what's going on....... and then stand befuddled on a balcony, wondering why it is that I cannot get ye flask"" ... uh, I mean, ""wonder what's going on in a city that is CLEARLY being attacked, and let three peon soldiers sneak up on me."" 

WTF Vincent. Has your brain leaked out of your ears? I recall you being rather unaffected by almost everything. And, maybe I'm wrong, but I am ALMOST positive that you came to terms with Lucrecia (not Lucretza, or whatever they call her in the game) back in that cave... at least, you did in MY game. 

I'm not even gonna touch how incredibly bad Barret looks DX 

Please, oh please Squeenix. Let FF7 die the peaceful death that it deserves. All of your fancy 'updated graphics' (which are hideous save for a few characters, btw) cannot hide that you are merely reanimating the zombie of a respected loved one (..... Kinda like Leon in Tales of Destiny)

In a way to show my disdain for you, Squeenix, I will use my KOEI Mitsunari icon."

Wild Arms 4... Well, I'm a bit miffed that the company has ADMITTED that they screwed up some code, and as such, there is *NO* way to complete the game 100%.

He'll watch a bunch of civilian guys get slaughtered and not even care, but a woman throws herself off a balcony and he's all sad about it. 9_9; I personally prefer heroes that want to help anybody they can. I mean, there are some people you just can't save, but you should at least not put more effort into ensuring that you don't save them...

.... I'll still play more, since I haven't gotten *really* far in it, but... Eh. Maybe I'll just finish it to have it finished o_O; So that the guys at my work can't say ""But you didn't even finish it D: How do you know you don't like it?"" 

Then I can get back to the games I *want* to play *w* Like... Devil Summoner, and Digital Devil Saga...and yes, even Tales of the Abyss >w>; Which, by the way, I'm only playing now for the costumes XD And so I can fanboy over Jade~ <3

::twirl:: It's too bad that I don't think there is an Air Gear video game. D: Kazu~~

I organized my figures, and so now I've just left a space for my Disgaea figures and my Shin Megami Tensei figures which are all at work... I might slowly bring them home, but at the same time, I wanna show them off at work D8

I'm a bit apprehensive about playing, of course, because this is very similar to a fps, and I am ABYSMAL with those sorts of games. Unlike, say, Silent Hill, you are supposed to fight. Most games I have of this nature prefer that you sneak around and only fight when you can't get out of it. This one actually says ""GO GET 'EM TIGER! 8D""

Finally cracked Final Fantasy 12. I got attached to Reks >w>; And now I don't want to play as Vaan. I don't really care for Vaan just yet, but that could change. The only FF hero I've liked from the beginning was Zidane anyway <3; The opening movies are awe-inspiring, but Squeenix has been like that for a while now. The movies themselves are beautiful, but the characters have a bad habit of looking like they're covered in soot once the integrated movies start.

It's nice to have 'hunts' that you can do as the game goes on. I'll have to take full advantage :9 And it seems there are quite a few side-quests available... It's fully dubbed, but very few of the voices are TOO bad... However, how come everyone talks in British voices with British slang? o_O;;

Vayne is... uh... kinda cute >>; But I'm concerned he'll be ebil.

"event","Okay, I will say, hands down, this is the best dating game sim I have ever played. It's even better than Sotsugyou. I haven't gotten my BL games yet, though, so they may win over. But for now, this is an amazing game D: I would recommend it for anyone. ANYONE. Even people who don't like games.

The basic story is as follows: You (Koutarou) are a high school student. You have a crush on this cute girl in your grade, Kaho, but she doesn't notice you. You're determined to ask her out before summer vacation. However, about a week before summer break starts, you are accidentally covered with a mysterious powder. When you wake up in the morning, you awake not the nexxt day, but the day after summer break is over. Arriving at school, you are greeted by your friends, expressing their condolences for your girlfriend who was killed in an accident the day before: Kaho.

Thus, your journey begins, making every attempt to make sure she is not killed. How you get there is up to you...

And just a warning note: don't get down about the 'ending' if it seems depressing. The epilogue, after the credits, usually makes things so much better <3

OKAY. With that out of the way, on to my opinions of the individual girls :3 <3

<B>Tomomi</B>
She's the first one I got, and I really don't mind, even though I wanted to see Mana first. So, she's your young science teacher, and she's sorta... not like a normal teacher. She's really into the supernatural. 8D And she's kinda mean to you at first, but... by the end of the game, I was SUPER attached to her. I, for one, think she's really pretty, especially when her glasses are off >>; 

She may come off a little harsh, but she softens up considerably as it goes.

<lj-cut text=""Tomomi spoilers"">
It turns out that she is like you, a day-dropper. It would seem that the powder you were hit with only enhances the user's psychic ability. She apparently day-dropped into a time where she saw her future boyfriend, and thus, never dated for her entire childhood. And by the time she was in college, she was disappointed, because her true love never came D: And so she ended up dating a big ol jerk >:( But you save her <3

However, there's a BIG problem. The time irregularity from before? It was caused by the fact that you and Tomo-chan were in such close proximity to each other. And the only way to fix it is to abandon your love for her by resetting time ><;; Dammit, I was so mad at that point. I was like ""You ain't breakin' us up!"" ... but in the end, I did it, because Tomo-chan wanted to ._. Man, I'm such a sucker.

But... it seems that you two were destined to be together, because even though time is reset, the natural feelings between you two are sparked again <3

Gallery password: TOMOTOMO
</lj-cut>

<B>Mana</B> 
My favorite, I strove to obtain her >( Even to the point of finding a walk-through because I never saw her in my first play-through. She's really cute, even though she frowns a good portion of the time. She's a younger student and is exceedingly interested in swimming. She even transferred to your school for. that. sole. reason. Of course, she's quite a loner, ignored by her teammates.

She likes cheese flavored energy bars X_X They sound... ewww. But, maybe they're different than the ones I'm thinking of. 

<lj-cut text=""Mana spoilers"">
The way to get her happy ending is to NOT save her. Yeah, counter-intuitive, ain't it?? Anyway, I guess it helps her get over her crush on the swim coach. ... Man, there is an awfully heart-wrenching scene where she's injured and is pleading with the coach to not abandon her, even to the point of falling out of the bed. The actress is amazingly realistic in this part.

She even tried killing herself D: But you save her, of course. And, trying to raise her spirits, I, like a moron, promised her that I would compete in an upcoming boxing tournament. Train me, Takeshi! ... Well, anyway, she came, but I lost. BADLY (not like you can win, but you know)... 

But, like the other endings, I really smiled when I got the epilogue. I have to say that her ending made me laugh and smile. If I dated girls, I'd so totally wanna go with someone like her.

<B>Ai</B>
The story with her shows you what a moron you can be. Jeez, she's probably the most openly sweet girl of them all. Although it takes a bit to get used to her voice, you'll eventually just wanna protect her. :3 Oh... and the way she wakes you up is ADORABLE. Well, Ai is adorable no matter what she does. >>; Even when she is mad at you.

<lj-cut text=""Ai spoilers"">
Her father falls ill and she has to end up staying with you. Also, she finds out about what's going on, and ends up being the only one you are able to tell the situation to. It's so sweet how she 'meets' you at each time you jump.

</lj-cut>

<B>Kaho</B>
Kaho is your standard pretty but essentially 'normal' girl. She's the default love interest, but you still need to win her over. She's soft-spoken, but somehow manages to be in the drama club. (Come to think of it, why are the quiet girls all in drama?) She's probably the hardest to win over, oddly. Although she's nice, she's got very high standards, and it's kinda hard to remember everything you've done with her in the previous days, especially since you randomly jump through time >>;

<lj-cut text=""Kaho spoilers"">
I... have not played for her yet. She's probably the last one I'm going after, too.

<B>Lee Jane</B>
Her name is much longer than that, but... uh... I just can't. It breaks my brain. She's pretty cute, but I think others are cuter. Of course, your character isn't very nice to her often. I like the combo of her hair and eye color. As it goes, she's mostly your 'incompetant sidekick' for most of the other storylines, but I hear you don't really get to learn much about her until later in the game.

<lj-cut text=""Lee Jane Spoilers"">
...ah... what could I spoil, really? I haven't played her.

So. It's a beautiful story, and the opening music is beautiful, and the art is beautiful. Man, you should all just go out and get this! >O I got the website address from a con I went to a while back, and it was the best one evar. Although the pictures don't really... move, it's fully voiced. EVEN YOU are voiced.

"event","Okay, so because I was flaunting my game list at work (8D;; ), one of my co-workers took it and wanted to approve my recommendation of a certain game, Legend of Dragoon. And, since it meets her standards (My recommendation of the game, that is ^_-), she asked me to talk about it here. Just so you know, the rating I gave it was 'Very High Recommendation""

SO, since I have not played any other games to talk about, and I was sort of dry for ideas, I took her up on it. Warnings: There may be spoilers as this was written under the influence of Jolt!Mints....

Okay, Legend of Dragoon. Man. What's not to like about this game?

Well, Blair, you say, it's got a fighting system that is rather different from most rps of this nature D: WELL MAYBE SO. But it really doesn't take that long to get used to utilizing it. People, come on, you don't need to do it right everytime. It's not as though the game slaps you on the wrist if you mess up. ..... I mess up sometimes.

...wow, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders 8D I'm vulnerable in games too!

... just kidding X3; Anyway, even if you're worried about the fighting method, the characters more than make up for it. There are very VERY few characters that you won't grow to like. And most of them are tolerable if you don't like them.

Don't be confused though. There *ARE* some characters that you will loathe. Like, I CANNOT stand Shana. ARGH. Maybe it's just because so many other characters are pushing you to like her more than you do. I dunno, it's almost as you think worse of her because so many characters are saying ""Why don't you like her more??"" Or, of course, there's the *SPOILERINSERTEDHERE* ... shoot, I've been censored. Well, anyway, there's some big surprise that, well, you really don't care about the worse option for your character. I just sort of shrugged and went ""Well, if that's easier..."" 

...Usually, I want to save the heroine, even if I want to whack her with whatever weapon is handy. But not Shana. T_T; She uses a BOW, people! A bow that you cannot use for combo attacks. So, essentially, now matter how strong you equip her, she will never be stronger than your next weakest character.

In regards to my favorite characters... Well, I simply love Meru... I'm sure you noticed the fact that I have an icon of her. Because she rules. The first time I played this game, I really had no opinion towards her. I was busy drooling over shonen-ai possibilities >>; But, then, as I continued, I played her more and more... and now she is my favorite character D: 

The dubbing is not so bad. There are times where the voices get annoying, but that's mostly on the part that you just hear the same line OVER AND OVER when you're learning skills.

What I like most is the Dragoon armor. Meru's the best, obviously, but I love the rest of them just as much. ROSE RULES, especially in her armor.

Man, there's so much in the storyline that will make you angst, or laugh, or just be even more intrigued. And it's chock full of side quests, which are the thing that make me happiest in games. 

... Well, that's a basic discussion of it. If you have any questions, please ask away. And if there's something in particular that you want me to talk about, then ask, and I'll tell you in the comments :D"

"event","Okay, so. Fighters. There's a couple of options if you want newer games. Of course, the problem with that is that most of the fighter games that have come out are from long running series.

First off, there's Mortal Kombat Armageddon: Kollector's Edition. Blatant game related mispelling aside, it's the most recent (and supposedly going to be the last) game in Mortal Kombat. So, okay, it's got LOTS of playable characters. As far as I can tell, it's pretty much every character from all the MK games to date. And beyond that, you can create your own. I haven't done much of that, but you can customize your character and take them online for challenges against other players.

Also, you can now customize and create your own fatalities by stringing together a bunch of moves ^^; I dunno. I don't really think it is so good that they had to take out a whole fighting style from each of the characters... And, to tie it all together, what has previously been a training mode has turned into some sort of adventure game?? HM. That reminds me of....

Soul Caliber 3. This is a less recent, but still the most recent game of it's series. Personally, I prefer this one. It's less senseless violence, more saving the world... unless you're an evil character >>; But whatever. You also get character customization, including different classes and different class outfits... 

And did I mention that the shop girls are cute? No? Well, they are. But beyond that, they each run shops where you can purchase clothes, weapons, and various archival things, such as movies and pictures. Although there are similarities with some of the characters and their weapons, overall there's at least one fighter that everyone will be comfortable with.

There's three new characters for this one, but unlike Soul Caliber 2, there are no differences between consoles with special promotional characters. On the plus side, you can 'create' characters you like from other games and use them. I actually have a character that, while female, looks ALMOST EXACTLY like Homunculus from Shadow of Memories.

All in all, I would have to recommend Soul Caliber 3. MK has some things missing, and an overall stiff style, but at the same time, SC3 has a very annoying AI that takes quite a bit of time to get used to. So, technically, they both have negative features. It all really boils down to, I'd say, which one has character designs you like better.

King of Fighters 2006 is also out there, but I haven't played it because I have way too many games to play before I can get it 8D

OH. I forgot to mention: Two recent fighters that I would not recommend. Tekken 5 - unless you only care about graphics, don't get this. And Naruto: Ultimate Ninja - only get this if you NEED all Naruto games. It doesn't seem to be getting very popular reviews..."

I don't recall which school Raidou supposedly goes to, they only mention it once in regards to the school uniform he wears underneath his cloak and paraphanelia.

So, Moh Shuvuu and Jack Frost are my favorite demons to have with me so far. Lamia looks oddly like Jenna Angel from Digital Devil Saga... which is interesting to say the least. It would be hilarious to have all the DDS people make some sort of crazy cameo like that. After all, Hitoshura shoved his uberleveled self into DDS...

Oh yeah! I beat up some Yakuza guys in a bath house! 8D Raidou was only in a towel... and his hat XD He didn't take his hat off... But, it must be a magical hat, cause he held his own without a demon. Now the Yakuza are my friends D:

I know that not many people look at this... but if there's ever a game that someone wants me to talk about, don't hesitate to ask about it. Like, if it's something you've heard me mention in passing, and you want to ask me about things in regards to it... I also do know things about SOME anime as well as movies, so... yeah.

But they sound good together 8D I'm not super far into it yet, because of lack of time, but it's not because I don't want to play. :< Kazuma Kaneko's art is awesome, as usual.

... Raidou and Narumi are so totally gonna date >>; ^^; of course, with the limited interaction so far, I really can't say that. But I want it to happen so nyah.

I sort of miss having to convince demons with more than just speedy button presses. But not enough to not play this superb game. And while there seems to be less demons this time around, I'm always happy to see new demons/entities so I can learn the mythology behind them.

I don't always push for people to play certain games. But if you can get a hold of this (it's going to be hard if you didn't preorder it), I suggest you do. The fighting is easy to pick up. AND, the game just jumps right into the storyline, unlike some games that can take up to an hour to establish themselves (I'm looking at YOU, Star Ocean 2)

Lots of people are making deals out of the PS3 and Wii preorders. Hn. I'm gonna wait for when/if they come down in price. The PS3... I won't even get unless they have lots of GOOD games. Not so-so games. GOOD. The Wii, on the other hand, looks pretty fun. So more games and lower price will lure me in.

And so, Rick says I should come to bed :9 So I will go. But... tomorrow I'll yak more, okay??"

"event","Valkyrie Profile came in today! OMGSQUEE...

....

Uhm. I mean ::Cough:: This game offers Squeenix an opportunity to win me back. I've loved Square/Squaresoft, and I've loved Enix. But their bastard child has GOT to go. ... Unless this game wins me over. (And, also, there's FF12 to consider)

.... I feel awful, because it's already winning me over (of course, I suspect that's actually Tri-Ace being so charismatic). The dubbing's not TOO terrible. Honestly. I'm sure I would enjoy the Japanese track better (based off of the clips I've seen elsewhere), but these will suffice. Unless they give Lezard a bad voice. At which time, I'd have to... well... smush them.

What originally got me to purchase the game was the graphics. And MAN do they make me a happy gamer-boy <3 The movies are super awesome and the detail in the clothing alone is enough to inspire you. I've only watched the opening and the beginning movie, but it's pretty clear the movies are gonna be the same for the entire game. But, besides that, the actual game-play is just as richly detailed. I haven't seen the battles yet, but I hear you have to become accustomed to the fighting style.

.... I wanted to play while at work, but the big boss man got mad. D: I was shooing customers to the next guy at work, so I understand, but... 8D;; :O When the store's not busy, though, Boss-guy lets me play, because I'm always giving game advice to customers XD;

OH. I got my Sister Princess plushies in the mail the other day :9 So I've been bringing them to work because NO ONE CAN RESIST THEM. Seriously. If I handed you one, you would think she was adorable D:"

"event","So, I've been reading through my Princess Maker 4 artbook, because I love the artist. But, then I was looking at a site, and, uhm....

This must be the first PM that allows your daughter to become a lesbian :9 After all, she can marry YOU, so at least the can give her the choice to live happily with her super cute rivals/friends, ne? (It's not considered a 'marriage' but she can live 'happily ever after' with them, or something sooooo) If I had to pick one of them, I'd pick Christine, because she's even cuter than the others (I like curly hair like hers, what can I say???)

So. Lee if she wants a guy, Christine if she wants a girl 83 Or she could, you know, just stay with me~ 8D;;;;;;;; ... okaymaybenot?

And, I think... I'd strive for her to be~~ a magician, because she's so adorable in her little witch costume *o*

........ okay, I'm gonna stop being a fanboy now. Online. At this moment. Temporarily.

okaythatdidn'tlastlong!

Lol, she can marry the mysterious merchant (Daratan)! XDD She looks incredibly cute doing it, but... uh... I'm hoping he's the little blue bear, because the old Chinese guy is... uhm >>;; nm, if that's what she wants, that's what she wants....

Okay, so her choices are Baroa, Lee, and Sharul. Baroa is, like... a demon guy. A general, I think. Lee is the Dragon Youth, who's always cute. And Sharul is the Prince. Because he's blonde, so naturally that's who he is 8D

Oh yes. Unlike the other ones (or I may be wrong) you find out how and when Cube joins you. He actually joins when Patricia does (man, that sounded like an rpg recruitment drive ^^;) He's very cute, and doesn't look so much like an uke in this part 8D ( http://www.kkpmc.net/pm4/OP/pm4op8.jpg )

Oh. AndCube'ssocute! Rick was worried cause I was 'squee'ing over the book so much. He said he was just relieved that I gave equal attention to the cute guys as I did the girls 8D; 

I wanna marry Cube :< How come only the daughter can? :< How come you can only heal your lonliness by marrying the daughter? 8O; Cube's cute! And the prince-tachi are too. 8< Lemme date them! I is a lonely brave hero :<

Valkyrie Profile Silmeria is coming out very soon. I *should* have played Lenneth first, but... uh, it's apparently hard to find for anything except PSP, and if you do find it, it's supposedly expensive... :< fuuu.

Okay, so I saw an article on Devil May Cry 4. Hm, too bad it's coming out only on PS3. It could have saved the entire series for me. DMC's storyline was terrible. So terrible, in fact, that it overshadowed all the other immensely awesome things about the game (graphics, fight engine, music). But DMC 4 is so awesome looking.. Too bad...."

Huwaah, I thought I saw something like that in one of my game magazines (I can't find the one I used to get anymore, though), but I just passed it over because I didn't think I could get anything like that.

Of course, I want the OTHER Princess Maker games too :< But the only ones I can find are imports. I used to have PM2 on my computer, but that died :< 

But this one has pretty art :< And I don't even know how it's played, but it's probably awesome! (If I could get my hands on it and Sister Princess, I would be a happy happy gamer) Though, shamefully, unless the princes/dateable boys were cute (which they totally probably are), I would want to marry this daughter instead of letting her date one of the boys her age :( I would be a baaaaad father ._.; ;~; But they shouldn't make the daughters so darn cute ><; (Uhm, what's the deal with all the incestuous Japanese games, anyway? :O I mean, you can marry your daughter in this, and you can date your sisters in Sister Princess... Are they just implying that love reaches beyond all boundaries? Or... that family ties don't matter if the female in your life is super-cute? o_O)

Maybe, I'll try to obtain an art book of it >>; So at least I'll have something..."

"event","omgomg, Rule of Rose came today :9 Later than I expected in the day, but it still came. Oh! But I didn't get to play any, cause I had to run out to see Shiyou 8D; I wanted to tell him about RoR, but... uh... we got caught up playing Disgaea 2 so... ^^; (Don't worry, Jennifer! I will save yoooouuu! ... just at a later time :9;;)

I beat the Dark Gate Keeper at an exceedingly low level (let's try... no one was above lvl 12, when she's lvl 100?) so NOW I can only use the first two levels to play in (and the item world, of course) because I keep unlocking and entering the Dark World when I try to play 1-3 D:! And, uh, they're MUCH too strong for me at this point ;~; WOE, I didn't intend it that way ^^; Of course, naturally, I saved BEFORE then, so I could always level up more and steal from her...

The tier unlocking in this game is silly D: You have to transmigrate into the next tier in order to unlock further tiers? Buuuu. And does it work that way for the monsters, too??? Yargh! D: 

And I can't leave the first chapter until someone has 5000 mana! DX Stupid unlocking rules!

I was going through the item world, but then I started sprinting through when my poor gunner (Jyun) was destroyed 8D; I shoulda known better; he was only level 4 XD; But I was leveling others up, because (at this point in the game) it's exceedingly hard to level up properly D: But now that I have another Mr. Gency's Exit, I can go back without worrying about destroying myself D8

I also need to start looking for the Pirates of the Item World so that I can get to the Land of Carnage :9 It's very VERY important that I get there, you know? 89 Especially cause of one of the characters you can use there.

I had some whole Suikoden 3 rant geared up, but Rick fizzled me out of it by noting that although I though that the game was bad, there were still some hot guys I could ogle :9 Is that an odd thing to have pointed out by a boyfriend??

I want to get Valkyrie Profile: Silmeria, but... :< I don't know if it's in Japanese or not. It wouldn't make a BIG difference, if not for the fact that game is by Squeenix, and the LAST game I got by them, the voices were VERY annoying :< And I want to see Lezard in his purest form 8D;;; But no sites I find say whether or not it's dubbed or subbed or both :<

Speaking of! Rule of Rose is interesting. The reason it came out so early was... although the voice actors are Japanese, they did the whole game in English! :O *o* Jennifer-chan is super cute :3 They should do stuff like this more often 8D;; Cause although it's in English, their voices are still nice, and not used to portray annoying stereotypes for characters that don't even FIT that stereotype o_O; If that makes sense.

Oh, and I'm torn. Should I get FF12? I'm thinking of getting the special edition, cause I get free (3-day) shipping for the extended pack. But what if it's as bad as 10 was? 8D;; I will admit, it looks very pretty, but the main guy and girl look... uh... related. Which is weird. But they're cute, at least.

8D And, uh, I gotta go! Worlds to go to, items to steal, cute people to play :3"

Granted, I haven't had any time to play anything lately. Games that I need to play are: Kingdom Hearts 2, Suikoden 5, Kuon, Fatal Frame, Disgaea 2, and Silent Hill 1-4. And then Rule of Rose is coming, hopefully this week. And in October dot.Hack//G.U. is coming, as is Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner.

... Why haven't I played these things yet??? D: Cause work, that's why! If only I was paid to play all day :9 But they're all sitting there in their bags going 'PLAY ME!' and I have to keep ignoring them :<

But fear not, my dear game-tachi. Soon, SOON, I will play you.

Oh, and my boyfriend, Rick, thinks I'm weird because I wanna play dating games :< where you date girls. And he's all ""???"" cause he hears me going on and on about how adorable different girls are 8D;"

"event","Okay! I got my Disgaea figures on Thursday. They're really cute D:

I got the Rogue and the Galaxy Mage. A friend of mine is sending me the blue-haired Archer girl (I... can't remember her title). I sorta wish the rogue had come with a sword, instead, to match how he is in the game. But... then I would've just been unsatisfied with the sword they gave him! 8D

They're, of course, named Kazuma (Rogue) and Masako (G.Mage) after my own characters. Recently, they've become good friends, and Masako is teaching Kazuma how to use magic (okay, technically, I gave him his own mage pupil, but it's close enough!)

Although I would sorta like a Laharl figure... hn. I don't care quite as much as I do about the ones I have/am getting. Although... I think I'd like a beast master figure, and an alraune(sp?) figure.

And speaking of figures for games... you know what would be really cool? SILENT HILL FIGURES. Of James. Damn, I want a James figure. I'd also like a figure of, say... Harry, and Henry. Heather, I could leave or take. If they made a figure of her well enough, that would be okay. But I still say she looks like she's on drugs D:

Oh. And if there's any questions about the new icon. It's Meru, of Legend of Dragoon. She's my fave character from that game D: Love her."

"event","You know what's a really underrated game? Shadow of Memories (Shadow of Destiny in the States, and a few other places). Of course, maybe it just seems that way because none of the forums I've been to have many topics about it (three at most? sad), And there's very little fanart for it. And while there are SOME fanfics, about 99% of them aren't that great.

Come on, people. What's not to like about playing a really cute and smart guy (who, however, doesn't seem to have much common sense), who interacts with an equally 'cute' and smart (but creepy to the same degree that Eike is clueless) guy who can help save him?

... okay, there is no fighting to speak of (unless you count fighting for your life?) but that doesn't mean the game is boring! You have to use reasoning and your ability to jump to different eras to change the 'future' of your death. :D What's boring about that??

There's also about six regular endings, and two extra endings. My favorite thing to do is take someone totally unexperienced in the game (since it requires no fighting) and have them play to see what ending they get. The game itself can be completed in about four hours (I've done it), and allows you to skip over scenes you've already seen, either in the current play through, or any previous ones. 

The voices are even pretty good (Charles Martinet plays Homunculus), with only... well... one exception. Augh, the voice. It's painful. (It's almost a crime, because -aside from his weird eyes- Hugo could be pretty attractive. He is, at least, in the concept art.)

The interesting thing, of course, is that you REALLY can interpret some things the way you'd like to. Depending on the ending, you learn different things, and not all of the endings can be... well.. connected to each other. Some give you different perspectives, others give you completely different theories. (uhm, I'd like to take this moment to pimp out the fic ""Blood Red Moon: A Shadow of Memories fic"" {uh, mostly accurate title, I think} by Twig.)

Maybe I need to, like, kidnap people just to make them play this game and see how good it really is -_- Don't reduce me to this, people!"

I'm looking around for more games that I want to make icons out of (or get from friends 8D;;), but I can't decide just yet. After all, there's so many good games out there, and I do want to try to get 'emotion' icons, too, ne? I need a grumpy one for when I complain about stuff! XD"

"event","Okay, so this has been brewing over the course of the week. So, I'll just list dates when things came to me.

August 30:
Got two new games, right? Disgaea 2 and Kuon. I haven't actually played any of Kuon but MAN is the opening creepy. And it's one of the first horror games I've seen that has the Japanese track.

Disgaea 2 is... well... to put it simply: it's awesome. Even though I'm attached to them, I'm not putting the same names for the characters. It makes no sense for Adel to have Laharl's pupils, right? 

Some of the translation is pretty bad (I was spoiled by KH2, okay?). Akutare rants for a whole paragraph, which is reduced (inaccurately) to a oneliner about an invisible taser. And early on, the mother calls her daughter 'komusume' and they translate it to 'brat'.. only to later have them use the (almost) same word for Rozalin and translate it as 'daughter.' Maybe it's just me being picky, but the mother reminds me of my own: she's supposed to say sugar coated things to you and then whack you with a spoon to get her point across. 

But other than those two little things, everything else is awesome. The sprites actually use whatever language you set them to! And the Archer's movement when she stands in place is super adorable. And I really loved the anime opening of the game. 

August 31:
Lots of people at work (I work at a video rental store) have asked me about Dirge of Cerberus... because I'm aparently the resident game snob? Hmm, and I thought I was so nice D:

Anyway, my response to you is this: you all brought this drivel on yourselves. This is the sort of thing you get when you cry for remakes and sequals. You get... well... this. An odd rehash of arcade shooters with super 'awesome' graphics, and loads of embarrassingly dumb new characters. 

Personally, I <3 Cait Sith (I admit he's not that easy to play with), but Vincent gets him and Yuffie as his comrades. The others make brief appearances, but that's supposedly it. And the dub voice that I belive is used for Vincent... well, he has a VERY nice voice, but... uhm, I'm hardwired to link him to Gale from Digital Devil Saga: Avatar Tuner. So.. no, he's not Vincent for me.

Oh yes, and I got a package today, and I find that I was shipped only the soundtrack of Rule of Rose. Jeez, Gamestop, you could have just waited to send it to me on the 12th when the game comes out. I drove Rick crazy yapping about how the game was coming early because you got my hopes up!

September 1:
I went to look for SteamBot Chronicles, because that game looks awesome. Didn't find it, but I did pick up Fatal Frame instead ^^; Rick's gonna kill me when he finds out."

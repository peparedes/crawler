"event","well. my friends  who i guess really aren't my friends piss me off so much. i cant even tell anyone how i feel. i cant believe you. you make me so mad. i just care about you so much. you make me so mad but i wont say your name. 

--------------

continue to having hilarious lives full of confusing twists and turns so i can read your livejournal entries about how your friends arent your friends who are your friends friends. or however that makes sense.

"event","I'm slowly embracing
The concept of you as a ghost
Hauting my kitchen
A phantom
A spector
A fantastic cloud
Such pedestrian dreams
What sexless visions
Of triumph and phonecalls
And email
Send me a kite
With a paper note 
Flown up the string

Leaving the house
Has started to feel like
A fourth graders christmas eve
Killing time at the thrift store
Returning on fire to
Tear through the caller ID
But my houdini lover
You've escaped and vanished
The bermuda triangle
Sunk to Atlantis
I'm slowly embracing
The concept of you
As it never was
And never will
But maybe 

I don't know if I'm waiting
I don't know if I'm waiting anymore
Or if it's over
It's probably over
I don't know if I'm waiting
I don't know if I'm waiting anymore
Or if it's over
It's probably over

I don't know if I'm waiting
I don't know if i'm waiting anymore
Or if it's over
It's probably over
I don't know if I'm waiting
I don't know if I'm waiting anymore
Or if it's over
It seems like it's over"

When dreams of rings of flowers fade and blur,
Giving way to that familiar ill,
Come over, come over
Where I'm waiting for you

No use in saying how I'm sorry
So I'm trying not to speak
I'll sing in silence as I lay beside you
With my face against your cheek

If you'd unlatch the window,
If you'd let me lay there on your floor
If you'd give me another chance,
If you'd forget the pain I caused before"

"event","Don't bother saying you're sorry.
Why don't you come in?
Smoke all my cigarettes - againe.
Every time I get no further.
How long has it been?
Come on in now,
Wipe your feet on my dreams.

You take up my time,
Like some cheap magazine,
When I could have been learning something.
Oh well, you know what I mean.

I've done this before.
And I will do it again.
Come on and kill me baby,
while you smile like a friend.
And I'll come running,
Just to do it again.

You are the last drink I never should drunk.
You are the body hidden in the trunk.
You are the habit I can't seem to kick.
You are my secrets on the front page every week.
You are the car I never should have bought.
You are the train I never should have caught.
You are the cut that makes me hide my face.
You are the party that makes me feel my age.

Like a car crash I can see but I just can't avoid.
Like a plane I've been told I never should board.
Like a film that's so bad but I've gotta stay til the end.
Let me tell you now,
It's lucky for you that we're friends."

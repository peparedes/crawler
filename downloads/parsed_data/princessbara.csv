"event","Ok let me fill you in, First I have started dating Kell. It started out just going to Olive Garden for his cousin's birthday. After that pretty much every weekend we have done stuff together except for Thanksgiving. Then I didn't get to see him for almost two weeks, :(. But then we went to the Peppermint Ball!!!  That was SO MUCH fun. We had a BALL. LOL! 
 Another thing is that we are so much alike. We think a like, and we do stuff alike. I have never found anyone like that. It is so great. You don't have to accommodate for anyone because they enjoy what you enjoy. 
 It is also a huge change from my previous relationship. I don't know why I stayed as long as I did. He did not even want to spend time with me. Oh, well. Now I have found the perfect match for me!!"

"event","I just got off the phone with my best friend. He knows who he is. It was the best conversation. Not much was spoken, but a lot was said. It made me have a great feeling just to hear his voice and I am pretty sure he felt the same, a voice of home. I wish no one ever had to leave, it kinda sucks. But I guess that is what life does prepares you to leave everyone except that one you will spend your life with, but sometimes that does not end up stable. In my perfect world though everyone has their one true love! My life would be perfect if my best friend  was here to share it with me. But he has to live his perfect life, too. ( But why so far away!) JK, I love you! Can't wait to give you a great big hug when you return. : )"

"event","What is love? I believe love is when you know that you have no regrets. Or you are satisfied. I don't believe love is about your adrenalin. I believe your ""butterflies"" or thrill comes from the knowing that someone you spend your time thinking about and caring for does this in return. 
 You know how everyone says that what we want is what we can't have. Well, I believe the people that still have a wanting for someone even when they are with someone else. Is not truely in love. One may be in love with the other, but it is not true love if it is not mutual. 
  I also do not believe that there is only one person for everyone, but I believe that you can only have true love with one person at a time. You can not have true love with two people, common sense. You are not satisfied with one therefore you look to the other for love also. I believe though if one of the partners were to die, then the one still left could find true love in someone else. I think this is a human characteristic, it is a device that we make ourselves do to not die when the other half of us does. Kind of like a rebirth of LOVE!
  I hope this gives inspiration to everyone to know that there is hope for happiness even better greatness. I pray everynight for everyone in the world to have this thing called LOVE. I"

"event","OK i just went to the football game. It kinda sucked and it wasn't just the weather. Ok I guess I am dating this guy or maybe not, but anyway... I sat with him and he kept talking to everyone else. AND THEN there was this girl that was sitting beside him and she kept messing with him and hooked arms with him. I was like ok is this just friendly stuff or is this like another girl that he is dating? So i left! I am tired of this shit. I just want someone who is going to love me and ONLY me! Sorry to be so selfish.

Love,

But two of my other best friends are gone. one is close but still not the same and the other away far away!I am ready to start school so I can be in on the action too. I love being with friendly faces.And I love being busy. I hope I meet the right guy. I need one! They keep me moving. I really would like a serious one, too.  I like the relationship of ttrusting one another and doing things together. Sharing the wonderful moments. I am scared I won't find one.

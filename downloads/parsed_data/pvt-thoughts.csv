Not only does he have a new cell phone, but soon will have a new livejournal, and a new spin-off MySpace page.

Stay tuned to pvt_thoughts' livejournal pages to see the updates!

Cell Phone: 240-412-9026
The phone is this little cute blue thing that wieghs no more than a ciggarette lighter.  It has a professional look to it, but still an almost closeted bisexuality to it.  It works for me.

That's all for now, but come back soon for more!

Unfortunately, I am at no liberty to discuss the issues I push down and drown deep, or else my hopes and dreams for my future will tumble down like cheerleaders with headcolds.  I sincerely wish I could just talk about what's bothering me, but I can't, and I am distracted.

There are so mnay conflicting thoughts and visions in my head, I am suprised I'm not tearing myself apart like a sinner in the 5th circle.  Is this right? Is that right? Should I or should I not? What does the UCMJ say? What does the Koran say? The Bible? My parents? My NCOs?

and, of course, where do I stand on these issues?

You are right to say that I need to rethink my values.  You are so right I ought to cite you for a ribbon. But how?  How do I rethink what I gave up thinking about?

"event","To start it off...I got my gray belt.  Sgt. Homa suprised us by teaching us all the rest of the moves...30 of them in 30 minutes...and giving us the test at Sunset.  It feels so awesome! I can now kick people's asses in 45 more ways! and defend myself in 14 more!  hehe.  Be worried my brothers, be worried. Just kidding, ya'll know I'll never hurt you.

The next morning, the detachment got up early and left for Gettysburg.  What an amzing little field trip. 

We ran the entire tour. Literally, we were either jogging, running or sprinting from site to site, stopping only for Master Chief to give us some information. It was so very Marine-like. I was so tired by the bonfire we had that night.  

The bonfire was so much fun. The entire detachment just sat around it and told stories.  Our NCO's had the greatest looks on their faces, and our CO was laughing her ass off after we told them. It's good to know they can get to know us without the pressures of...well, nevermind, it's a marine thing.

We camped out and I realized that a pop-tent can be a very comfortable thing.  Especially since I'll be using it alot if I go to Afghanistan.  Actually, I'm hoping for that deployment.

We came back and I spent Friday just hanging around, watching TV. I watched Baseketball, Hostel (YUCK! EW! GROSS! WHAT THE FUCK???), Batman Begins, and part of the exorcism of emily rose.  

And also...Team America...""EVERYONE HAS AIDS! AIDS AIDS AIDS AIDS!""...take that Rent! How dare thee get stuck in my head and cause me to sing your catchy songs in the middle of PT???

Saturday was pretty boring. I caught up on sleep and laundry. Two things abdly needed.  But Saturday night I went with Joe, Kari, Mario (dave), and his little Texan girlfriend to a Hookah bar in Baltimore. The Zeeba Lounge is a really nice place.  It's small, comfortable, has tasty foods and a belly dancer! And this woman was so gorgeous! I tucked 5$ into her little skirt. hmmm...anyway.

So now it's sunday and I'm getting my ahir cut and cleaning my room. The fun never ends at the Marine Detachment, Fort Meade.

I also want to cook. I just got a great new recipe I want to try.

Well, that's about all for this morning. Protein juice drinks are vile. I'm getting my graybelt very soon.  Sgt. said he'd like to give it to me right now, but I still have a few more training days left.

Okay, I gotta get my chuckies on.  Oh, by the way, I can't wear any civilian clothes this weekend, unless I'm inside my house.  These NCOs are tricky. Not only are they watching me, but so is the Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Army NCOs. FUN!  Oh well, it's a comfortable uniform.

But something good came out of it.

I've signed up for a gray belt martial arts class.  For all of you who got a letter from bootcamp, I will now be a graybelt marksman.

I decided that instead of having an NCO bark at me like I were a recruit, I was going to get some physical activity done.  It helped.  My anger faded away, and when one of the sergeants mentioned the belts effectiveness towards promotion, my motivation peaked right up.

I didn't even care that m room was torn apart by those overzealous NCOs inside.

I do care that my roomate thinks it's my fault.  He can fuck himself on that one. Mr. I-talk-back-to-fleet-returnees-because-they're-just-Lance Corporals.  They still have authority jackass, you don't downtalk or talk back to them.

I just got back from New York, the Bronx.  It was awesome.  Many people might think of the Bronx as a ""hood"" full of spanish hoodlums and guns and drugs.  Well...what city isn't???  lol.  Seriously, the Bronx is a really nice area, and I now know 35 Puerto Ricans and 10 Dominicanas by first name, and they know me.  Family is real tight up there.  I enjoyed it.  Prisclla's family is indescribable.

I also went to Tribeca.  Saw a new monument they built: Irish Hunger Rememberance.  It was a very nice. Very touching.  Very tranquil.  It's built to look like a piece of the Irish countryside.  It's very pretty.  

I also saw Ground Zero.  nah...I don't even want to get started my feelings there.  

I got my haircut by a nice old Puerto Rican...took nearly an hour.  lol.  But once you go Puerdiqua (I forget the actual spelling), you can never go back.  So, I have to find a new barber nearby.  

I may or may not be coming home this weekend, but I do have the 29th scheduled to come home.  I won't back out on that.

PT was fun this morning.  I just love when my Marines give thier full 75%.  It really shows that they know why they joined.  

I may be changing ym name soon.  ""Persona Fully Clean"" or something, so look out for that.

That's about all I have to pass.  Oh, sleeves up today! WOO!  Get to look like big bad mother fuckers again. YES!

Anyone have anything for me? Very well, if no one has anything for me, I have nothing for you.

What?  Yes, features today. No rewrite, meaning I'll be locked inside the barracks until two A.M again.  I have to srive for perfection this time. My last story was weaker than a high school gothkid who lost his parents to a car crash because his dad was hitting the mom while driving because he just snorted three lines a crack he had to suck dick for in order to stay awake at night to make enough money for the rent of the typical suburban house with a two car garage and a cadillac that is being mortgagsed off to prevent it being forclosed because the dad lost all his ... anyway...

Why do we make these choices so young?  Why must we believe we know what's right?  

I want him back.
I'll never get over him, will I?  No man, or woman will ever be better than he was.  But does that mean I should give up looking?  Feels right...I don't know.

"event","Hey everyone!  Still not in training, but still quite busy.  I'm on a working party that demolishes old furniture.  I tear the wood from the metal, burn the fabrics, and throw the wood out in the dump.  Just the other day Sgt., LCpl., and I were trying to hit seagulls.  Now normally, and especially if you've heard my story of the dead seagull, I would be against such cruelty.  However...THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM!!!

I thinned out their numbers.

The thing I'm truly against is when stupid, restless, bored Jarhead-grunts toss rocks at the birds, and laugh as the poor thing lies paralyzed on the deck.  Who was laughing when the grunt had to crush the bird's head?  Well, I wasn't, but I felt satisfied that the situation was punished accordingly.  Stupid, stupid jarheads.  

We're not all killers.  No, not true, I am a killer.  We don't all kill superfluously or for pleasure.  That is wrong.  A man takes another man's life when that life is deemed central to threats, terror or general human waste.  Understand?  Good...this is the official Marine Corps status on physical violence.

But we are all trained to kill.  I could do it very easily using my fingertips.  *thrusts forward* ""MARINE CORPS!"".  hehe...such a fun little movement.  just thrusts forward with the fingers extended...so simple, so deadly.

Okay, enough about death.  What's new?  I just bought the two new Shakira Cd's.  Spanish good, english annoying.  I also bought the two latest Coheed & Cambria CDs.  Both are very good.  I'm listening to ""In Keeping Secrets of Earth"" or some shit like that.  It's their third CD.

Well...I can't stand still...so I'll update again later.  Ciao Bella.  Semper Fi.

"event","Ok I'm bored so I feel like making a list of good 80s songs because I'm in a 80s mood right now. There's tons of 80s songs that I love but these are the ones that are popping out of my head :

ANTHRAX - Antisocial (a fun classic metal song...Anthrax is one of the few metal bands that I still have much respect for)
THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN - Just Like Honey (its such a sweet and pretty song)
DURAN DURAN - Hungry Like The Wolf (me loves Duran Duran and their synth popness...hehe)
NEW ORDER - Dreams Never End (just a great and fun synth pop song...me loves synth pop it makes me happy and danceyful)
NINE INCH NAILS - Sin (synth pop and Trent Reznor...what other reasons do i need to explain that this song is good)
MADONNA -  Live To Tell (one of Madonna's best songs from the 80s)
JANE'S ADDICTION - Jane Says (a beautiful yet strange song)
BLONDIE - Heart Of Glass (i grew up listening to Blondie...so yeah....i just got stuck liking those songs that I heard when I was little. i still have a collection of their vinyls.hehe)
THE CURE - The Lovecats (a very fun and dancyful song that has somewhat of a blues feel i guess....this song always makes me happy when I hear it =D....I think its because the way Robert sings ""ba ba ba ba ba.....so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully pretty"" just sounds so fun.lol. yes i'm a dork )
THE CULT - She Sells Sanctuary (its just a fun song....very danceyful)
JOY DIVISION - Love Will Tear Us Apart (its just a great love song from the 80s)
IRON MAIDEN - 2 Minutes To Midnight (another great song from the 80s...good song and good guitar solo)
THE SMITHS - How Soon Is Now? (if you haven't heard this song then that will suprise me. this is a must hear song from the 80s)
MOTLEY CRUE - Looks That Kill (i normally like guys with make up (yes i know i'm weird)...but they have scary poofy hair which is scary....but nonetheless Motley Crue is still one of the few cool hair metal bands from the 80s. Looks That Kill would definetely have to be my favorite Crue song from the 80s)
MY BLOODY VALENTINE - Feed Me With Your Kiss (has somewhat of a punk music sound feel to it...but its still a great song....i love shoegazer bands)"

"event","Ok I got bored earlier and I just thought I would write a short entry on why I choose my name ""lamp halo"" for my lj and other places since I already haven't done so here....since some people seem to be wondering lately ""what the heck is a lamp halo"". lol.. It was just a name that I started using because I got bored of my last screenname that I was known for as ""OrangeButtercat"". I felt it was time to change my screennames name and at the moment my favorite song was ""Lamp Halo"" by Zeromancer so the name just kind of came to me while I was listening to that song. And I thought the name sounded cool and it kind of fit well with the kind of title that I wanted for screenname. Ok well here are the lyrics to the song ""Lamp Halo"". 

Lamp Halo by Zeromancer

It's my life
Yeah I know
It's not a perfect one, but
It's a life
I can live with

But you don't know
If you can
And you don't know 
If you want
Cause you don't know
If I'm the right one
And you don't know
Well let me tell you

There's
Something inside 
That's freaking me out
Please don't
Leave me alone
Something inside me
Is wearing me out
Please don't
Don't do it again

Just like a fly  
On a jar 
Twinkle, twinkle little star 
You don't feel like you belong here
But it's your life 
Even though
It's not perfect 
It's a life you can live with"

"event","I changed my icon yet again. I've really been getting into the band Lunarclick lately. I have to admit its Lunarclick's fault that I'm starting to get into Deadsy now. Lunarclick and Deadsy don't sound anything alike....but I started listening to Deadsy because I thought Lunarclick's guitarist was pretty and he's in the band Deadsy to (lol. yes i know bad kitty! bad kitty for wanting to listen to a band just because i think a band member is pretty....lol) so I decided to give Deadsy a chance and d-loaded their songs ""Brand New Love"", ""Tom Sawyer"", and ""Winners"". At first I didn't want to listen to Deadsy because I thought they were a copycat Orgy band....but now I found out that Deadsy were the ones that pretty much I guess I can say started the whole synth rock sound not Orgy. Yes I know I use to speak so meanly and badly about Deadsy but now I like Deadsy. Its weird. lol. I guess its because I'm starting to get into a bunch of newer bands that have the whole synth pop sound to their music and before I use to hate that kind of music. So I guess really I wouldn't be listening to Deadsy just because I think that Carlton from Lunarclick is pretty...at least that wouldn't be my main reason....my main reason would be because I've recently since about almost a year ago I started liking synth music(regular synth, synth pop, and synth rock). 

I joined The Birthday Massacre street team recently. I've already done a bit of street team work for them but now I'm an official street team member. I've already done street team work by giving out sampler cds and telling people online about them. So yeah if your ever bored and want a sampler cd then let me know and I'll mail one out to you or give one to you. :D I make these sampler cds myself though....so its not a very pretty cd....but its a cd so its still fun to listen to.

I'll probably be going to Austin this Thanksgiving to go visit my brother. I miss Austin...its been awhile since I've gone out of town and gone to Austin. 

I can't believe in about a month and a half it will be Christmas. Soon I will need to help my parents put together the Coca Cola City in the living room (oh god how I hate those stupid Coca Cola figurines and the bajillion of houses I need to help set up for Xmas). I need to start looking for a job for Xmas time. Hopefully I'll have more luck looking for a job for Xmas....I need the money.

I've been thinking about what I want for Xmas so far now too. lol. Yes I know its early. So far I know I want :
The Birthday Massacre's cd ""Nothing and Nowhere"" (because its finally gonna be re-released but in a very limited amount quantity....so I MUST get this), Lunarclick's cds (both the debut album and the new EP), a Sailor Saturn doll (I'll probably have to look on ebay for that though because those are hard to find), many many movies (i need to update my movie collection), and a synth guitar.

<img src=""http://www.the-anix.com/evolve/images/guitars/red-707-tn.jpg""> *drools at the sight of pretty synth guitar* ......ahhhh pretty guitar. I doubt I'll get that though....its too much money. :(

"event","Ok well I thought I would write an entry here since I'm insanely bored here waiting for my next class to start and msn is acting like a complete asstard for not wanting to let me talk to anyone on there. Thats the second day in a row that its been acting stupid. grrrr.....

I had a very odd dream last night. It was really weird. It was about the end of the world, zombies, and aliens. My dream was like watching a cheesy b-movie horror film. It had its moments when it was getting quite predictable. In the beginning of my dream the world is being taken over by zombies so everyone I know really well from my circle of friends and my family were there. Everyone was hiding out in my house. Another really weird thing about the dream was that I was five years old and Dave Grohl was my uncle in my dream. The being five years old part of my dream was weird but having Dave Grohl as a uncle was pretty cool. hehe. It was weird because when I was five years old in my dream everyone was the age that they are now. That made no sense. So the world was being taken over by zombies on my fifth b-day during my b-day party. I remember I was wearing a pink dress on my b-day in the dream and then all of the sudden when I'm about to get a ton of presents and then the stupid zombies appear out of nowhere attempting to kill everyone in sight at my b-day party. Stupid zombies. They could have at least waited until I went inside and took all my presents inside in my house. Then everyone went inside of my house really really quick and then we look in the closet and there is a zombie there. I don't know why...and I don't know how that zombie appeared out of nowhere. That part of  the dream made no sense. Well when I saw the zombie I shot the zombie in the head and killed it....I also don't get how I got a gun all of the sudden in my dream. That was also weird. After that I don't remember too much accept that the zombies eventually ate my sister and dad. After awhile after that happened eventually all the zombies died....I don't remember how all of them died but eventually all of them died. So everyone thought everything was gonna be ok...and then all of the sudden aliens come and take my mother and half of my friends. The aliens had really cool spaceships....ok I just went off topic on what I was trying to say. lol. After that part of the dream I was eventually the right age and I was 19 years old again. So then everyone hides out in my house again and Dave Grohl is stuck with taking care of me in my dream and he feeds me Kraft Macaroni and Cheese everyday for the rest of the dream. Poor Dave Grohl....I probably annoyed the heck out of him in my dream. So then after that the aliens eventually go away but everyone is still hiding out in my house...I don't understand why though since all the of aliens and zombies are gone now. Then after that at the end of my dream I'm just making out with all of the members of Kill Hannah. lol. I have no idea how that happened and why that happened at the end of the dream....I guess the dream just wanted to have a happy ending that would make no sense and had nothing to do with everything else in my dream. lol

Hmm....ok well anyways I'll probably be writing as much as I can within the next few days here if I have the time to since as of next week I'm not quite sure if I will have internet service at my house anymore. Boo!!! Lately my parents have been having a lot of financial problems so that has caused them to not really have any money to pay the Cable connection for my internet. I think I might get a 56K connection...which is slower than a slow motion dying tortoise walking. Me no likey 56k....it is the devil and its slow and its stinky and it frustrates me. Now I have no idea how I'm gonna d-load the next two last episodes of this seasons Dead Like Me....its gonna take so long to d-load if I try...hopefully someone or my brother will be kind enough to mail me a copy on cd so I can watch both episodes without having to wait almost an entire year to watch those episodes. 

I think my first practice with the band I'm in will be this weekend. I'm not looking foward to it that much. I dunno why. I guess its because I'm broke and my acoustic guitars strings are on the verge of its death...and my electric guitar is one string less from that it needs. Its a  good thing I found out the other day I have more money than I thought I had because now I'll hopefully be able to buy some strings before the end of this weekend. All I know so far are a bunch of Cure songs and Kill Hannah songs...me needs to work on learning more prettyful songs."

"event","Ok I know I didn't have the last diary look too long but I got bored of the colors. Since its pretty late to work on that stuff and it look me about an hour to get the colors and the diary look to come out that way the last time....I decided I will be fixing the diary look and colors later on within the next few days (hopefully). I will also be putting up a few poems I guess. 

This weekend was pretty tiring. I don't know why I was so tired.I took two naps today. I feel so lazy. My sister woke me up during my second nap because she was trying to tell me that I was singing out loud The Smiths song ""How Soon Is Now?"" lol....I dunno why I was singing it....I guess maybe because I had that song stuck in my head all day. After my second nap I went out and bought tons of Hello Kitty stuff I bought a few tiny spiral notebooks, pens and pencils, and lots of stickers. hehe. I feel so weird and dorky for buying a bunch of stuff only a kid would probably use....but I couldn't resist all that cute stuff especially since all the stuff I bought all together just cost less than 6 dollars. Earlier today I also felt like being a nice and sharing person so I decided to help someone by uploading for them on their site a Birthday Massacre bootleg that probably only 10 other fans other than myself have. Its not finished uploading but hopefully within the next few days it will be up on the site for A LOT more fans to be able to have the chance to download the bootleg. 

Ok well I'm really tired so I'll update this later with another entry and hopefully make the diary look prettier later on too."

"event","Ok I thought I would just update this thing since I felt the need to update it. 

Lately I feel like I have way too much time on my hands. I need to start a hobby or something. I've been getting bored too often now. I wish I had the money though to just start a hobby like learning to play another instrument or something like that. 

The new school semester has been ok I guess. I haven't really made too many new friends. But I've managed to converse more with people that I don't know a little more often than usual. I've always had a hard time with making friends....I dunno I guess I'm just shy. The only class I really don't like that I'm taking now is my American Lit. 1 class. I've never reached that level of insane evil boredom in a class before in my life. That teacher is just really boring and the class is pretty boring too because I don't have anyone to talk to for at least even a few minutes. So yeah I don't think I've learned anything in that class the past two weeks. lol. Which is pretty bad. I guess I should read the boring stores in that class a bajillion times so that way I get at least half of it. lol. Other classes that I'm taking this semester are Trignometry, Speech, and Government. All of them have been ok. The work hasn't been overwhelming and boring in those clases. So thats good. 

I still have a evil cold and cough. I can't even talk for a little bit without having a almost crazy kind of constant cough attack. 

I saw half of the movie Prozac Nation last night since I couldn't sleep because I was feeling sick. So far its pretty good. I'll post later my review and whatI think of it though when I finish watching the movie. I should have finished watching the movie though since I couldn't fall asleep until 3 in the morning. grrrr. I need some sleep and cough medicine and I need to finish watching the movie because I want to know what happens."

"event","I went to the Curiosa Festival in Houston last week. It was quite fun. I got to see a few good bands there. I got to see some of Head Automatica's and Mogwai's performances. They were pretty good. I also go to see Auf der Maur and The Cure in concert. I got to meet Melissa Auf der Maur  and she seemed very sweet and down to earth. I got her to autograph a promo poster that a friend of mine got for me and I got her to autograph my copy of the Auf der Maur cd. Well anyways here's a few pics from the festival that a friend of mine took and gave me so I thought I would post them here for you to see. =D
